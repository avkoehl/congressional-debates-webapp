any certificate of freedom to any slave, by which
means such slave may be enabled to abscond from
the service of his master or owner, such master
may have a remedy against such free negro in
any court of law, and the court before whom such
free negro may be tried may adjudge such free
negro to be sold at public vendue, and the money
arising from such sale shall be paid to the owner
of the slave. (1796, chap. 67.)
Upon information to any justice of the peace
that any free negro or mulatto is going at large
without any visible means of subsistence, such
justice is required to issue his warrant to any con-
stable of the county, directing him to apprehend
such free negro or mulatto; and if such free negro
or rrtulatto shall fail to give security for his good
behavior, or to leave the State within five days,
or if after leaving the State he shall return again
within six months, such justice may commit said
free negro or mulatto to the common jail; and if
such offender so committed shall not within twenty
days thereafter pay his or her prison charges, the
sheriff of the county, with the approbation of any
two justices of the peace, may sell such free nesro
or mulatto to serve six calendar months. (1796,
chap. 67.)
The eighth section of the act of May 1, 1820,
gave to the corporation of Washington " power
and authority to restrain and prohibit the nightly
and other disorderly meetings of slaves, free ne-
groes, and mulattoes, and to punish such slaves
by whipping, not exceeding forty stripes, or by
imprisonment, not exceeding six months for any
one offense; and to punish such free negroes and
mulattoes by penalties, not exceeding twenty dol-
lars for any one offense, and in case of the in-
ability of any free negro or mulatto to pay any
such penalty and cost thereon, to cause him or her
to bo confined to labor, for any time not exceed-
ing six calendar months; to prescribe the terms
and conditions upon which free negroes and mu-
lattoes may reside in the city; to punish corpore-
ally any colored servant or slave for a breach of
any of their laws or ordinances;" "and to pass

The acts of March 3T1805, and March 3,1809,
confirmed to the corporation of Georgetown all the
rights, powers, and privileges theretofore granted
to the corporation by the General Assembly of
Maryland, among which was the power to " pass,
make, and ordain all laws necessary to take up,
fine, imprison, or punish any and all vagrants,
loose and disorderly persons, free negroes, and
persons having no visible meansofsupport." In
pursuance of this authority the corporation has
passed the ordinances of which the following ab-
stract is given:
Every free black or mulatto person who shall
come to Georgetown to reside, shall, within three
days, exhibit to the Mayor satisfactory evidence
of his or her title to freedom, and shall enter into
bond with two freehold sureties m the penalty of

member of his or her family, to be renewed eveiy

more than thirty days, or fined not exceeding
twenty dollars. (August 22, 1845.)

dangerous person, and shall for each offense be
fined, not exceeding twenty dollars, or committed
to the workhouse not exceeding thirty days, and
the sureties of the offending party shall be imme-
diately required to pay the amount of their bonds;

If any servant or slave shall offend against the '
market ordinance, and be unable to pay the fine,
such servant or slave shall be punished by whip-
ping, not exceeding thirty-nine stripes. (January
22, 1831.)
Such, Mr. President, are the laws enacted or
permitted by this Christian people, this republican
Government. A sense of deccncy should prompt
Congress to erase these laws and ordinances fiom
the statutes of the Republic. I earnestly com-
mend the bill to the attention and consideration of
the committee who have in their keeping the affairs
of the District of Columbia.
The bill was referred to the Committee on the
District of Columbia.
Mr. WILMOT. I desire merely to say at this
time that, in my judgment, the Senate should act
promptly upon the bill for the abolition of slavery
in the District of Columbia. That is the meas-
ure which covers the whole ground. It embraces
the bill of the Senator from Massachusetts, it em-
braces every question that can be raised on this
subject. In my judgment, we shall have been the
most derelict in our duty of any body that ever
sat in the seats of power if we adjourn this Con-
gress without the abolition of slavery in the Dis-
trict of Columbia. I move that the. bill reported,
I believe, by the Senator from Maine [Mr. Mor-
rill] abolishing slavery in the District of Colum-
bia be made the special order for Wednesday next.
Mr. FOOT. There is a special order for Wed-
nesday.
Mr. WILMOT. Then I will say for Thursday
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Pennsylvania moves to postpone all prior orders
for the purpose of proceeding to the consideration
of the bill abolishing slavery in the District of
Columbia. The Chair is infortaed by the Secre-
tary that the bill is still with* the committee, and
has not been reported.
Mr. WILSON, ofMassachusetts. The Secre-
tary is mistaken. The bill was reported favorably
by the Committee on the District of Columbia,
several days ago, and I did hope that it would be
taken up speedily. I will say to the Senator from
Pennsylvania that the bill was very carefully pre-
pared, that it has been reported with very slight
amendments by the committee, and I hope that it
will be taken up at an early day. The bill which
I have introduced this morning is only following
up that bill and repealing the black code of the
Districtโthe laws applicable to persons of color
in the District. It is a necessary bill to be passed
also, and I hope when we have done that we shall
go a step further, and offer to the State of Mary-
land the same terms that we offer to the people of
the District, and clear this thing out of our neigh-
borhood.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretaiy was
mistaken. The bill is on the table, and has been
reported.
Mr. CLARK. I desire to say to the Senator
from Pennsylvania that I am as anxious to pro-
ceed with that bill as he is; but the Senator from
Maine [Mr. Morrill] has charge ofit, and he is
now sick. I suppose he will be here in a day or
two. He has given his attention to it almost
wholly; and perhaps it would be well to let it be
until he shall come in.
Mr. WILMOT. Very well, sir. I withdraw
the motion I made.
RAILROADS IN MISSOURI.'
On motion of Mr. WILSON, of Missouri, the
Senate, as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded
to consider the joint resolution (H. R. No. 37) in
relation to certain railroads in the State of Mis-
souri.
Mr. HALE. Iam notatall opposed to making
every compensation which is just and reasonable
to these roads for the damages they have suffered
in consequence of this rebellion; but in my judg-
ment the basis of compensation assumed by this
resolution is entirely wrong. If I understand it,
a grant of public land was made to these roads, in
consideration of which they agreed to transpoit
the troops and munitions of war of the United
States free of cost; but the preamble to this leso-
lutton sets out that they have been unable to do
so m consequence of the rebellion and the injuries
inflicted on their roads by the rebels. Then, in-
stead of making compensation adequate to the
injury, it goes on to give discretion to the Secre-
tary of War to make a contract with them, such
as has been made with other roads, to pay them,
and to pay them prospectively, as I understand,
for all such transportation as they may perform
for the United States, with only a limitation upon-
it that it shall not exceed the contracts that have
already been made by the War Department. If
