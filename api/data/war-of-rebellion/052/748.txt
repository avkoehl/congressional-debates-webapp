Black, rockets, &amp;c. I will send all my cavalry down in that direction at once. Order McPherson to have his cavalry look at Hankinson's Ferry, and look out on the south front. I was up at Oak Ridge yesterday, and saw and heard of no signs in that quarter.

General RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A gentleman just in from Jackson says there is not an infantry soldier this side of Morton, and that Cosby's brigade is disposed at Clinton. I will reprimand Colonel Fletcher for making such a report. I have Mobile and Selma papers to the 15th of September. Bragg overhauled for evacuating the Valley of the Tennessee, but a big battle going to happen somewhere; but I know the ground thereabouts, and don't believe Bragg intends to fight at all. Things statuquo at Charleston on the 11th. I will send the paper in the morning.

General RAWLINS:

Both my judgment and information unite in pronouncing the stories sent me by Colonel Fletcher and pickets as twaddle. I would be too happy if the secesh would commit the mistake of coming all the way to find us, and save us that long march to the east. Still I had to act on the information and have sent to all points accordingly, but it can do no harm.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General OSTERHAUS:

When Colonel Winslow's cavalry reaches you, order it down to the neighborhood of Hall's Ferry to cross Black River and feel out toward Fourteen-Mile Creek to ascertain what is the meaning of the signals reported by Colonel Fletcher. I will send a brigade across at Messinger's to feel out abreast of Edwards Depot.

Major-General.

General OSTERHAUS,

Black River Bridge:

All right; go ahead. A gentleman that I know well is just in from Jackson. there is not an infantry soldier on this side of Pearl River, and but limited cavalry. Take a brigade of infantry
