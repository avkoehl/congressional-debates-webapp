The advance are now at Comite River, having bridged White's Bayou, Redwood, and the Comite, and prepared the roads up to that point. Yesterday morning a portion of the force crossed the Comite and had a sharp skirmish with Powers' regiments driving them to within one mile of Clinton. Our loss was 2 killed and 1 officer and 4 men wounded. Enemy's loss, 5 killed and quite a number wounded. Hodge is concentrating at the covered bridge, twenty miles north of Clinton, and will have about 1,500 men with five pieces of artillery. I sent a train this morning with rations and forage for the advance, and will hold them at the Amite for a day or two longer.
