Major-General ANDERSON, New York:

I have directed the sailing of the Arago to be postponed until Saturday, the 8th, at noon, so that, if possible to leave here, I may join you at Fortress Monroe. The absence of the President and Attorney-General and Assistant Secretary of War, and the severe injuries disabling Mr. Seward, absolutely prevent my leaving here to-morrow.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

We have Lee's army pressed hard, his men scattering and going to their homesby the thousands. He is endeavoring to reach Danville, where Davis and his cabinet have gone. I shall press the pursuit to the end. Push Johnston at the same time and let us firnish up this job all at once.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, Richmond, Va.:

I have just heard of the occupation of Richmond and Petersburg. I expect orders from you, but in the absnece of any I will hold on to Goldsborough and the two railroads and move on Raleigh. I think Johnston still remains about Smithfield. I will strike him anyhow, moving out on the 10th. In the meantime will expect orders via New Berne from you, as I don't know the line of Lee's retreat.
