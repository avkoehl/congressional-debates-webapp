HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, July 5, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER FIRST BRIGADE:

If you deem it desirable,you may withdraw your second line after night-fall to-night, and encamp it on the creek in rear and as nearly opposite to its position on the line as the ground will admit. You will encamp it so as not to intermix with the troops on the right or left, and also that you may readily form line and move up to your position on the works. Let these troops alternate with the troops on the first line every forty-eight hours. No officer or enlisted man on duty in the first line will be permitted to leave his company or regiment except with the written permission of his regimental and brigade commander. At any time when you deem your troops encamped at the rear necessary for the defense of your lines, by reason of any demonstration of the enemy or an attack, you will immediately order them to the front without further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers W. TURNER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I am very anxious to show a portion of my line which can only be seen in the morning, about daylight, or in the evening after sunset. If your duties will permit, will you ride up this evening and spend the night with me, or to-morrow afternoon and go with me in the evening?

WM. F. SMITH.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS,Near Petersburg, Va., July 5, 1864.

Brigadier General JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff;

GENERAL: Have you received the letter* from me inclosing the statements of Brigadier General E. W. Hinks and Captain Choate with reference to the condition of the colored troops of this corps? The division is now commanded by a colonel, who is reported to me by General Hinks as being inefficient. I am extremely anxious the general should take some steps to make this organization as effective as possible. While I think them capable of being made excellent infantry soldiers, they particularly need intelligent, brave, energetic, and resolute officers. I
