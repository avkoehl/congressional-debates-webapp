Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 2, 1862-10 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Buell thinks the enemy intends uniting behind the Tennessee River, so as to be able to concentrate either on you or Buell. In this case it become doubly important, first, to hold Nashville; secondly, next to gain possession of Decature and the line of road in that vicinity, in order to isolate Johnston from Memphis and Columbus must soon fall. Chattanooga is also a point of great importance for us.

Arrange details with Buell.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL,

I have telegraphed Halleck that it is important sot seize Decatur and thus isolate Johnston from Memphis and Columbus. Of course you must hold Nashville firmly, and Chattanooga is a very important point to gain.

Arrange details with Halleck, co-operate fully together, and give him all the assistance you can. Push Carter forward as rapidly as possible. What is Garfield doing?
