Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: A prisoner just taken states that Forrest, with Jackson's division of calvary and two brigades of infantry, left Murfreesborough day before yesterday for Columbia, where he may be to-day. Buford's division of cavalry left Murfreesborough the same day, and marched continuously until they struck this road, and have since been covering the rear of the infantry. Johnson is now engaging the enemy to the right of Spring Hill, and everything is pressing forward tot his assistant. I will push them as rapidly as I can toward Columbia to-night, and then take the route as indicated by the major-general commanding.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,Chief of Staff, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: All our efforts to bring the rebels to a stand this morning have failed, though their alluring positions have carried us tot his place. I have halted to issue rations and ammunition,a n will push on to Rally Hill as soon as possible. All indication are that the rebels have no intention of halting this side of Columbia. Lee's and Hood's headquarters were about Spring Hill last night; Cheatham's here. I am not entirely sure that we shall gain time by taking to the left, but we will do the best we can. If you have any further orders, please send them at once.

Very respectfully, your obedient savant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
