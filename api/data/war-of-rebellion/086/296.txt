WASHINGTON, October 28, 1864-12 m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

General Grant thinks you can and ought to send troops to assist General Thomas. The latter wishes that any you can spare should go up the Tennessee River, if possible, as far as Eastport, under convoy of gun-boats. Communicate with him at Nashville. I shall be absent from Washington for several days.*

H. W. HALLECK,

Four companies Thirtieth Wisconsin were sent to Saint Louis by a misapprehension of commanding officer at Saint Paul. Their proper destination was Nashville, via Louisville. The commanding officer of these companies will probably report to you to-day. Please show him this dispatch, and order transportation to be furnished by rail to Louisville.
