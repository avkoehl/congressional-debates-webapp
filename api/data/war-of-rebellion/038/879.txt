The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you send at once to this point 76,000 rations, exclusive of soap, candles, &amp;c. Also, that you be on the alert in the direction of Baldwin's Ferry. He has just learned from a Federal prisoner, a commissioned officer, that Smith's DIVISION is at Baldwin's Ferry, and they are still re-enforcing. You will re-enforce that line with Baldwin's brigade, and, if necessary, also with Waul's Legion.

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,H. C. TUPPER,

Aide-de-Camp.

HDQRS. DEPT. MISS. AND E. La., Edwards Depot, May 14, 1863.

Major-General FORNEY,

Commanding:

You will direct Brigadier-General Baldwin to move up and take position at Mont Alban, to guard all approaches to the Big Black Bridge, particularly from the rear. He will be assigned the command of all troops guarding the Big Black Bridge and its approaches, front and rear. The artillery belonging to Stevenson's DIVISION, now in the trenches in front of the bridge, will be relieved by the field battery now serving with General Baldwin, which will be pushed forward with all rapidity, so that the artillery relieved may join Major-General Stevenson's DIVISION with the least possible delay, provided with three days' rations. A section of the Hudson battery, commanded by Lieutenant [J. R.] Sweaney, camped near the Cox Hospital, 2 miles in rear of city, is placed at your disposal. The army is expected to move to-morrow morning in the direction of Dillon's, on the Raymond and Port Gibson road, and all communications will be directed to that place.

By order of Lieutenant-General Pemberton:
