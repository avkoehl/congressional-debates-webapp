merchants' national bank.
Mr. LYNCH. I ask unanimous consent to
submit the following resolution :
Resolved, That the evidence taken in the investi-
gation of the failure of the Merchants' National
Bank of Washington, District of Columbia, by the
Committee on Banking and Currency in the Thirty-
ninth Congress, be withdrawn from the files of the
House and placed in the hands of the Credit Mobilier
Investigating Committee, of which Mr. "Wilson, of
Indiana, is chairman, and after being used by said
committee, be printed for the use of the House.
In explanation of the pertinency of this res-
olution, I will say that before the committee
of which the gentleman from Indiana is chair-
man it has been testified that some of these
bonds, to the amount I think of $80,000, were
deposited by this same witness in the Mer-
chants' National Bank; and if the committee
have that testimony before them, I think they
will be able to judge somewhat as to the dis-
position of a part of these bonds.
There being no objection, the resolution was
considered and agreed to.
Mr. LYNCH moved to reconsider the vote
by which the resolution was adopted ; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
