Governor MORTON, Indianapolis:

Am much obliged for your dispatch. The force I have now in pursuit, I think, will be sufficient, and General Hascall has arrived with his command, so I do not think I shall need the two regiments from Lawrenceburg.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Governor TOD, Columbus, Ohio:

Your dispatch received. Information received at these headquarters indicates that Morgan is in the vicinity of Batavia, making for the river. I do not think he intends t go to Chillicothe, but your precautions are very good. I am much obliged to you for the movement, and will inform you of the movements of the enemy from to time.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

General WHITE, Catlettsburg:

Morgan made a raid into Indiana and Ohio, and is making for the Ohio River, near Ripley. He may be kept from crossing by the gunboats, and he may go above to cross. I will keep you posted. Look out for him. General Hobson is but 10 miles in his rear with a large cavalry force. They both camped in Clermont Country, Ohio, last night. We hope to catch. him.

A. E. BURNSIDE,
