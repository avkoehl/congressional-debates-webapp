IRON-CLAD VESSELS.
The attention of this Department was turned to
the subject of iron-clad vessels immediately after
the commencement of hostilities and the adoption
of measures for the enlargement of the Navy. ,It
was a subject full of difficulty and doubt. Exper-
iments upon a large scale of expense, both in Eng-
land and France, if not resulting in absolute failure,
had achieved but a limited and questionable suc-
cess. Yet it was evident that a new and material
element in maritime warfare was developing itself,
and demanded immediate attention. In this view
I recommended to Congress, at its extra session,
on the 4th of July, 1861, the whole subject, and
asked authority to organize a commission for in-
vestigation. Thirty days after this action on my
part Congress conferred the authority requested,
and appropriated $1,500,000 for the construction
of one or more iron-clad vessels upon such models
as should receive the approval of the Department.
On the day after the law had been approved the
commission was constituted, and the Department
advertised forproposals. Of the various plans and
propositions submitted, three vessels of different
models were recommended by the board, which
received the approval of the Department. Con-
tracts were forthwith made for constructing the
Monitor, the Galena, and the Ironsides. All of
these vessels are now in the service. It was the
intention and eonstanteffortof the Department and
the contractors that the Monitor should be com-
pleted in the month of January, but there was delay
in consequence of the difficulties incident to an
undertaking of such novelty and magnitude, and
there were also some slight defects, which were,
however, promptly remedied, and she left New
York early in March, reaching Hampton roads on
the night of the 8th.
Her arrival, though not as soon as anticipated,
was most opportune and important. For some
time the Department had heard with great solici-
tude of the progress which the insurgents had
made in armoring and equipping; the large war
steamer Merrimac, which had fallen into their
hands when Norfolk was abandoned. On the af-
ternoon of the 8th of March this formidable vessel,
heavily armored and armed, and fully prepared
to operate both asuramandu war steamer, came
down the Elizabeth river, accompanied by several
smaller steamers, tv/o of them partially armored,
to attack the vessels of the blockading squadron
that were in and about Hampton roads. When
the Merrimac and her attendants made their ap-
pearance, the Congress and the Cumberland, two
sailing vessels, were anchored off Newport News,
and the remaining vessels were in the vicinity of
Fortress Monroe, some six miles distant. The
Minnesota, the Roanoke, and the St. Lawrence
got immediately under way and proceeded towards
the scene of action.
The Congress,being nearest to the Merrimac,was
the first to receive her fire, which was promptly
returned by a full broadside, the shots falling ap-
parently harmless ofTfrom the armored side of the
assailant. Passing by the Congress, the Merri-
mac dashed upon the Cumberland, and was re-
ceived by her with a heavy ,weli-directed, and vig-
orous fire, which, like that of the Congress, piu-
duced unfortunately but little effect. A contcxtso
unequal could not be of long continuance, and it
was closed when the Merrimac, availing herself
of her power as a .steam ram, ran furiously against
the Cumberland, lajnngopen her wooden hull,
and causing Iwt almost immediately to sink. As
her guns approached the water's edge her young
commander, Lieutenant Morris, and the gallant
crew stood firm at their posts, deliveied a pai ting
fire, and the good ship went down heroically, with
hei colors llying. Having thus destroyed the
Cumberland, the Merrimac turned again upon
the Congress, which had. in the mean ume,bcen
engaged with the smaller rebel steamers, and af-
ter a heavy loss, in order to guard against such a
fate as that which had befallen the Cumbciland,
had been run aground. The Metrimac now se-
lected a raking position astern of the Congress,
while one of the smaller steamers poured in a con-
stant fire on her starboard quarter. Two other
steamers of the enemy also approached from
James river, firing upon the unfortunate frigate
with precision and severe effect. The gui'S of the
Congress were almost entirely disabled, and her
gallant commanding officer, Lieutenant Joseph B.
Smith, had fallen at his post. Her decks were
strewn with the dead and dying; the ship was
on fire in several places, and not*a gun could, be
brought to bear upon the assailants. In this state
of things, and with no effectual relief at hand, the
senior surviving officer, Lieutenant Pendergrast,
felt it his duty to save further useless destruction
of life by hauling down his colors. This was
done about four o'clock, p. m. The Congress con-
tinued to burn till about eight in the evening, $nd
then blew up.
From the Congress the Merrimac turned her
attention to the remaining vesselsofthe squadron.
The Roanoke had grounded on her way t<£ the
scene of the conflict; and although she succeeded
in getting off, her condition was such—?her ."pro-
peller being useless—that she took no part ih the
action. The St. Lawrence also grounded "toear
the Minnesota, and had a short engage^entjynth
the Merrimac, butsuffered no serious injury^and
on getting afloat was ordered back to*Fortress
Monroe.
The Minnesota, which had also got aground
in the shallow waters of the channel, became the
special object of attack, and the Merrimac, with
the Yorktown and Jamestown, bore down upon
her. The Merrimac drew too much water to
approach very near; her fire was not, therefore,
particularly effective. The other steamers se-
lected their position, fired with much accuracy,
and caused considerable damage to the Minnesota.
She soon, however, succeeded in getting a gun to
bear on the two smaller steamers, and drove them
away—one apparently in a crippled condition.
About seven, p. m., the Merrimac also hauled off,
and the three stood towards Norfolk.
All efforts to get the Minnesota afloat during
the night, and into a safe position, were totally
unavailing. The morning was looked for with
deepanxiety, as it would, in all probability,bring
a renewed attack from the formidable assailant.
At this critical and anxious moment the Monitor,
one of the newly finished armored vessels, came
into Hampton roads, from New York, under
the command of Lieutenant John L. Wordcn,
and a little after midnight anchored alongside the
Minnesota. At six o'clock the next morning the
Mcrrimac, as anticipated, again made her ap-
pearance and opened her fire upon the Minnesota.
Promptly obeying the signal to attack, the Mon-
itor ran down past the Minnesota and laid herself
close alongside the Merrimac, between that for-
midable vessel and the Minnesota. The fierce
conflict between these two iron-clads lasted for
several hours. It was,in appearance,an unequal
conflict; for the Merrimac was a large and noble
structure, and the Monitor was, in comparison,
almost diminutive. But the Monitor was strong
in her armor, in the ingenious novelty of her con-
struction, in the large caliber of her two guns,
and the valor and skill with which she was hand-
led. After several hours'fighting the Mcrrimac
found herselfovermatched, and, leaving the Mon-
itor, sought to renew the attack on the Minnesota;
but the Momtoragani placed herself between the
two vessels, and reopened her fire upon her ad-
versary. At noon the Merrimac, seriously dam-
aged, abandoned the contest, and, with her com-
panions, retreated towards Norfolk.
Thus terminated the most remarkable naval
combat of modern times, perhaps of any age.
The fiercest and most formidable naval assault
upon the power of the Union which has ever been
made by the insurgents was heroically repelled,
and a new era was opened in the history of mari-
time warfare.
L'efore the occurrence of these events, entertain-
ing a coin iction that at least, one of the models of
iron-clad vessels—that of the Monitor, an origi-
nal invention of John Ericsson, of New York—-
would prove a-successful experiment, and that it
was particularly adapted to our harbor and coast
defense, and service on the shallow waters of our
sen-board, 1 estimated, in my annual report, last
December, for the immediate construction of
twenty iron-clad steamers. The House of Rep-
resentatives promptly responded to this recom-
mendation, and passed a bill *• authorizing and
empowering the Secretary of the Navy to cause
to be constructed, by contract or otherwise, as ho
shall doem beBtfor the public interest,  at exeecd-
