Mr. TAPPAN then moved to amend the bill so
as tj add to ¡1 e last sep ion a proviso that nothing
in the act should 'hould be considered as an ad-
ral «ion that Cong e*s has not the power to alter,
modify, or repeal 'he charter.
Mr. T. took 'he ground that this was an

wij uncotisti utioial, it should be repealed—
whoever injurious it should be repealed. In a
very able and e'ear constitutional argument ha

Mr. TAPPAN then withdrew it for the present.
