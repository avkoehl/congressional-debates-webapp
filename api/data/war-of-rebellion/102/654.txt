Major W. HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Southern Division of Louisiana:

Captain Murphy, commanding Confederate outpost, wishes to have his command, consisting of his own and Captain Vinson's company, with a few detached officers, paroled here under the agreement made between General Canby and General Smith. If this cannot be done, he asks that he and such officers as are necessary to accompany him may be furnished transportation to the point designated. They have no communication with their higher officers, everything with them being in confusion. Please let me know what reply I can make to them.

Yours,
