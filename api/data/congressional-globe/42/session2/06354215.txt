Estimated annual reduction in internal revenue
by House bill No. 2322 :
Spirits.
The substitution of a tax of sixty-five cents per
gallon on spirits in place of the present per diem,
barrel, and gallon taxes, would probably have the
effect neither to increase nor diminish the revenue.
Tho anticipated increase of revenue by substitut-
ing the amendment to section forty-eight for the
original section will doubtless more than compen-
sate lor the loss occasioned by the payment of the
salaries of storekeepers and gaugers by the Govern-
ment, and by the repeal of the tax of warehouse
stamps.
Tobacco.
Estimated annual loss on manufactured tobacco
(snuff excepted) by substituting a uniform rate
of twenty cents i>er pound for the present ratrs
of sixteen and thirty-two cents.
