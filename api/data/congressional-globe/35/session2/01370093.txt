Book of Mormon, they have produced anew and
accurate edition. They state that they are in-
formed, by many persons in whose opinions they
confide, that one of the most effectual means of
winning back the victims of the lamentable and
wide-spread delusion of Mormonism, would be to
give tiie Book of Mormon a large and free circu-
Dtl0,^rr^UghoUt the United States, and that the
Kooi^jf Mormon does not sustain the gross su-
peistitions and errors believed and practiced by
that sect. For these reasons they respectfully
PW.'he passage of a resolution to publish copies |
ol this book for distribution throughout the Uni- i
ted States. I move that the petition be referred i
to the Committee on the Library. !
Mr. PEARCE. I move that it be laid on the •
table. I do not think it is worth while to refer i
such petitions to the Committee on the Library, i
It will only give us the trouble of making adverse I
reports, I presume. I
Mr. SEW ARD. If the chairman of the Com-'
mittee on the Library is satisfied that the com-
mittee understand the question which is involved,
that is whether the Book of Mormon does not
give countenance to the practice of that sect, I
should not object to that proposition.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
from New York insist on his motion'
Mr. SEWARD. No, sir.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The petition will
lie on the table.

cent, ad valorem., and by the act of 1857 reduced
agam to twenty-four per cent.; and under the last
act the business broke down.
Referring to the Secretary's report, it will be
seen that the average price of pig iron for twelve
years, from 1846 to 1857, inclusive, was $29 06,
and that at thirty per cent, the duty would have
beeq $8 70. From 1848 to 1853 the average price
was $23 54, and at thirty per cent, the duty was
$6 76; and yet the total consumption of iron and
steel and the manufactures thereof, imported, was
during these five years of low duty but $84.326,254;
whereas during the next five years, from 1853 to
1857, inclusive, the consumption was$]34,432,328,
although the price had risen to $33 20, and the
duty at the same rate would have been $9 96, in-
stead of $6 76; showing conclusively that a low
price and a low duty do notincrease the imports
or the revenue. It follows, that this law rate of
duty is not the revenue standard. w
The tables furnished by the Secretary are a
conclusive answer to the theory of ad valorem

METROPOLITAN RAILROAD.
Mr. PEARCE. I have been requested to pre- j
sent a memorial of numerous citizpns of Mont- i
gomery county, Maryland, praying that Con- i
gress will authorize the Metropolitan Railroad I
Company to connect their proposed road with j|
the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, by "a track!
through the cities of Washington and George- j llu„ ml,guls,1(!
town. I understand that this company was in- jl us wiie" foreign iron is plenty and cheap,
corporated some years ago by the Legislature of j'
li
jl duties mi iron, and prove that it is alike opposed
to the interests of the Government and of the
consumers of foreign iron and steel. This I pro-
ceed further to demonstiate.
At pages 85 and 86 of the printed memorial of
the ironmasters of Pennsylvania, are given cer-
tificates from machinists and consumers of iron in
Philadelphia and Boston, who concur in saying
that they do not find the low prices of foieigii
iron any advantage in their general business, and
for the reason that they find the consumption
greatest and business most satisfactory when
remunerating prices are general, and when all
branches of business are in full activity. The
Boston manufacturers, who consume twenty-four
thousand five hundred tons per annum, say:
" The consumption ot oui manufactured ariiclcs falls off
when the manufacture of iron languishes, and orders fail
Maryland, and that Congress gave their assent
to their laying down their track within the Dis-
trict of Columbia as far as Georgetown. They
propose now that Congress may authorize them
to lay down a track from Georgetown to this
city, to carry a branch of it to the navy-yard, and
to connect with the Baltimore and Ohio railroad
at their depot,"and in consideration of that to
carry the mails of the United States free to and
from the city of Baltimore and their proposed
junction with the Baltimore and Ohio railroad, at
ornearthe PointofRocks, below Harper's Ferry.
The memorialists are very respectablepeople, and
I think their memorial is so couched as to entitle
it to candid consideration at the hands of Con-
gress. I move that it be referred to the Commit-
- tee on the District of Columbia.
The motion was agreed to.
THE IRON TRADE..
Mr. CAMERON. 1 submitto theSenate, with !
a request that it be printed for the use of the mem- j
bers, a memorial and other documents relating j
to the manufacture of iron in Pennsylvania, pub- j
lished by the convention of ironmasters which '
met m Philadelphia, on the 20th December, 1849; 1
and other additional statistics, furnished by mem- I
bers of the American Iron Association, and I j
wish to make a few remarks explanatory thereof, i
In table 47 of the annual report of the Secre- j
tary of the Treasury, of last year, he gives the j
yearly average price of pig-iron in New York for
thirty-eight years, from 1820 to lb'57; which, I,
find, making an average for the whole time, to i
be $34 20. The duty on this price, at thirty per i
cent., would have been $11 26 per ton; underthe j
tariff of 1824 it was §10; 1828, $12 50; 1832, §10; |
1833. $9 47 4-5; 1837, §9 23 4-5; 1839, $8 47;
1841, $5 20 4-5; 1842, §9; 1S46, thirty per cent.
1 find, also, that Hie duty under the tariff of
1842, on rolled bar iron, was $30 per ton, and on
other bars $18 per ton.
In 1S28 the duly on rolled bars was §37 per
ton; on other bars, §22 40 per ton.
Under the act of 1832 the duty was reduced.
In 1839 on rolled bar iron it was §21 40 per
ton; on other bars, $15 32 4-5 per ton.
In June, 1842, on rolled bars, $13 60 per ton;
other bars, $12 87 1-5 per ton.
By the act jf August, 1842, on rolled bars, $25
per ton; oilier bars, §17 per ton
By the act of 1846 it was made thirty per
The reason of this is given in the letter of Mr.
John A. Wright, who says:
"The average number of men employed at a charcoal
furnace, making 1,000 .ions pig iron ppr yeai. n notles^ thau
70—making a population, immediately dependent, of not
less than 3o0. The aveiajre numbei of horses andinulep is
not less than 50. The amount of gram u*ed will nor vary
much from 2,500 bushels of wheat, 3,1100 uii-W-!> of com
3,000 of oats 1,000 of rye, 80 tons of hay, and 3.(100 bundle?
of straw. The amount of merchandise sold, near §8.0i)0;
and, in addition, theie is a large amount of bacon used;
anil the fanner finds a market for all the vesetaUes and
truck he will raise. Ills butter, eL'gs, veal, potatoes, &c.,
articles which will not bear iransportation to market, and,
what is no unnnpoitant item, savin" a laiee quaintly of
manure to be used at home to ennch the soil."
The same letter says that the effect of the erec-
tion of furnaces is, that lands which otherwise
would not be worth more than from $1 to $5 per
| acre, sell for $40 and $50 per acre.
i We find, from the Secretary's table, that the
1 production of pig iron, which, until 1820, was
j but 20,000 tons, had, in 1855, risen to 1,000,600 !
tons. If we apply the data given by Mr. Wright I
to the million of tons, we find that if 1,000 !
tons employ 70 men, then 1,000,000 will require I
70,000. If 1,000 tons support 350 persons, then
1,000,000 will support 350,000. If 1,000 tons em- |
ploy 50 horses, 1,000,000 will employ 50,000 !
horses. If 1,000 tons require 2,500 bushels of 1
'?na 5!f pig iron, consume $8,000 worth of mer-
chandise Is it not because the seventy men who
! oi *n manufacture earn at least
® ,000 per annum; a part of which pays for the
merchandise, and a part for the agricultural prod-
ucts which they consume ? Do gentlemen who
advocate a mere revenue duty take into consider-
ation the facts, that by diversifying labor that by
employing seventy men in making iron, we give
employment to many more in agriculture, who by
the supply of these seventy men aid their families
with provisions, &c., obtain the means of con-
suming foreign imports, and thus contribute their
proportion of the revenue ? Do the opponents of
an increased duty upon iron take into consider-
ation the fact, that unless the duty be so increased
as to enable- our ironmasters to compete with
foreign iron, the three hundred and fifty persons
now dependent on the iron tnanufacture must be-
come agriculturists, and that the effect must be a
redundant supply, and that the value of the whole
agricultural produce, increased as the quantity
will be, will be diminished in the rate of excess ?
for there will be an increased quantity without am
increased consumption. This, then,is the solution
of the fact, that the consumers of iron find that
their business is less profitable when foreign iron
is abundant and cheap. It is because the intro-
duction of cheap foreign iron, at a low rate of
duty, ruins the home manufacture, and by depriv-
ing the farmers of a home market for their surplus
produce, deprives them of theirability to purchase.
This memorial embraces other important facts.
We find, by tables given on pages 99and 100, that
1 Pr,ce°f P'£ iron, in Glasgow, has varied from
i $33 75 to §10 394, and that the price of bar iron
| has varied $69 59 to $25, and that the best iron
j was charged at from §6 25 to $8 50 extra price.
j ^an any one of the advocates ofa low, ad valorem
duty, explain the reason why the price of iron
should fluctuate so much in the British market,
or can any one justify a system of duties liable to
so much uncertainty as a system of ad valor ems on
prices so variable ? But the uncertainty and fluc-
ation in prices are not the most valid objections to
a system of ad valorem duties on British iron. It
is known that the British manufacturers produce
a cheap article for our iriarket, made of the refuse
■ I material which is unfit for use; but being- low-
|! priced, and paying but little d«ty, is introduced
;; and placed on our railroads, and by wear and
|j breakage is the cause of most of the accidents
|: and loss of life by which the country is too often
lj astounded. A moment's reflection must satisfy
|i every intelligent person that, however applicable
I! a system of ad valorem duties may be to other ar-
j j tides, it is a most unwise system for the duty on
1 iron. 11 is •& premium for fraudulent manufac-
i tures, and for fraudulent invoices. And who are
| benefited by it? Not the Government, for it di-
j minishes the revenue. Not the railroad com-
; panies, because it is now understood that the wear
j on such iron is from fifteen to twenty per cent, per
i annum, whilst the wear on good American iron is
I about one per cent. only. Not the farmers or plant-
I ere, not the consumers of iron; because none of
: these can, orwitl use this fraudulent stuff. What,
i then,is the remedy ? I can see no other but a spe-
cific duty, which will forbid the importation of
wheat, 1,000,000 will require 2,500,000; 3,000,000 i! this fraudulent article.
bushels of corn, 3,000,000 bushels ot'oats, 100,000 I j I would referSenators to the letterof Mr. Reeves
bushels of 80,000" tons hay > 3,000,000 bundles I and to analyses which he gives, showin°* the rel-
straw, $8,000,000 worth of merchandise, and, in
the same proportion, bacon, beef, eggs, butter,
vegetables, &c.
The advocates of low, ad valorem duties, place
theii theory on the basis that the price is vegu-     
lated by the demand. I ask them to estimate || the statements and tables explanatory of the man-
what the relative effect on the prices of their great j| ner in which the manufacture of iron has been
staples of agricultural produce would be if the
threehundred and fifty thousand persons engaged
ative cost of manufacture m this country and in
England; and the manner in which the farmer,
the minet, the owner of land, the railroad compa-
nies, and the capitalists, are benefited by the man-
ufacture of iron. I would, also, refer Senators to
! in and dependent on the manufacturer of pig-iron,
! instead of being consumers of these agricultural
products were engaged in agriculture ? What
would be the effect on the price of agricultural
products in the interior, and especially in the ie-
mote parts of the great West, if there were no
; railroads or steamboats to cheapen transportation?
! And how are the railroads and steamboats built ? j
i Are they not the result of the surplus profits, and
; the credits resulting from the profitable employ-
! ment of our labor ?
| fcHow can the three hundred and fifty persons
1 dependent on the manufacture of one thousand
fostered and strengthened m England by duties
as high as §39 52 per ton, until it now defies com-
petition, and will continue to do so until, by a
wise system, we bring into use the abundant ma-
terials which would soon enable us to create the
capital and organize thelabor which will not only
command bur own market, but would enable us
to compete with all others in the markets of the
world.
In conclusion, I would add, that it will be seen
that a specific duty will be a less ad valorem on
the higher-priced iron, and will thus benefit the
farmer, the planter, and the workers of iron, who
all use the fetter and higher-priced bars; whilst
it will exchide the low-priced bars, made for sale
