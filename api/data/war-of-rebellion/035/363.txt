General BURNSIDE:

Following just received from Somerset:

I have no further information that is reliable. I fear, however, that many of the river guards from month of Fishing Creek down the river have been killed or captured. They belong to First Kentucky Cavalry. Will it not be well to send First East Tennessee (mounted) Infantry to Liberty of vicinity to guard that line;

CARTER.

I have notified Byrd to get his regiment ready. Shall I send it? I have also a regiment ordered to Stanford from Second Division. Shall this or more force from Crab Orchard be pushed across?

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Please give such instructions as may be necessary.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, May 25, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The following just received from Somerset:

Your dispatch, with General Burnside's, received. Have just heard from Colonel Kautz at mouth of Fishing Creek. Enemy were driven across the river by company of Forty-fifth Ohio, Captain Scott, who captured a captain, lieutenant, and sergeant. Colonel Kautz was moving toward Mill Springs. I hope we have received no further damage than the loss of a few careless guards, who, from all I can learn, permitted themselves to be surprised. Unless rebels have crossed below Mill Springs, there is no considerable force on this side river. I have scouts toward Jamestown and 17 miles up the Cumberland. I have no idea of falling back, and if rebels should get between this and Liberty they shall be punished.

CARTER.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

MAY 25, 1863.

General WILLCOX:

Tell General Carter that if the enemy are crossing in force at the month of Fishing Creek, he must move out and fight them; if they have already crossed and gone toward Liberty, he must detach a sufficient force to follow them. The whole thing is in his hands, and I feel satisfied that he will not fail to use his force skillfully, and that he will not fall back until it is demonstrated that the safety of his command demands it. Keep the force at Crab Orchard ready to move at a moment's notice. Send Byrd to Middleburg and Liverty, with instructions to hold the enemy in check if he moves in that direction, in order that Carter may be enabled to overtake him. Tell Carter to Telegraph frequently during the day as to the state of affairs. The force at Columbia and Jamestown have been informed of this movement.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

I have ordered Colonel Byrd to Middleburg and Liberty, and a small regiment of infantry (Fifty-first New York) to Hustonville. The rest of
