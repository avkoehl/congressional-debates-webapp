Report of Captain George R. Swallow, Seventh Indiana Battery,

Chief of Artillery.

HDQRS. ARTILLERY BATTALION, THIRD DIVISION, September 29, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to submit herewith copies of the official reports of the commanding officers of the batteries of this division, and also a list of the names* of the killed, wounded, and missing.

The Independent Pennsylvania Battery went into the action with:

Commissioned officers ................................... 5

Enlisted men ............................................107

Total ...................................................112

The Third Wisconsin Battery went into the action with:

Commissioned officers ................................... 3

Enlisted men ............................................116

Total ...................................................119

The Seventh Indiana Battery went into the action with:

Commissioned officers ................................... 5

Enlisted men ............................................117

Total ...................................................122

I submit these reports without comment, as the batteries were acting and moving under the orders of yourself and the different brigade commanders, almost as often as they were from [under] mine, and a detailed report from me would be simply a copy of their several reports. It is, however, my painful duty to note the death of Captain A. J. Stevens. As an artillery officer he had few equals and no superiors. His only fault was in being too brave and fearless. By his own personal labors, he saved two of his guns on both Saturday
