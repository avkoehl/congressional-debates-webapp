SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 10, 1864.

(Received 7. 50 p. m.)

Colonel JAMES A. HARDIE, Inspector-General:

The advance of the rebels is within seven miles of this city, on the York road. This is considered reliable.

W. W. MORRIS,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding, &amp;c.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 10, 1864-10. 05 p. m.

(Received 10. 10 p. m.)

Colonel JAMES A. HARDIE, Inspector-General:

Repeated reports confirm the presence of the enemy on the York road at Cockeysville and Towsontown, variously estimated from 1,600 to 7,000. All reports tend to the theory that a force intends to cut the Philadelphia road. The report of the destruction of the Gunpowder bridge on the Northern Central road is reliable, I think, I have sent two small steamers to the Gunpowder and Bush River bridges, one to each, with a howitzer. Major Judd, at Wilmington, was instructed to strengthen the infantry guards at the bridges named. He reports that he has done so. General Cadwalader, at my request protect the bridges.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

I have the honor to submit the following dispatch, handed me by Colonel Clendenin at Ellicott' Mills:

GENERAL: Will you have General Augur send me the dismounted men of my regiment, through you, to be mounted; also Company F, on duty with Colonel Gamble at Dismounted Camp, and Company L, on duty in the city, leaving one company in barracks? I would also like to have the three companies on duty up the Potomac, as I have only my own regiment on which I can rely.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. R. CLENDENIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Eight Illinois Cavalry.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General of Volunteers.
