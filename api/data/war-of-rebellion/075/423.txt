road. General Thomas will move to a point about two miles in front of Colonel McCook's present camp, at a place where is represented and old court-house (Golgotha, I think), whence radiate roads to Sandtown, Marietta, Acworth, Dallas, and Burnt Hickory. He will feel forward toward Marietta and Big Shanty. Should he call for you, or should you hear him seriously engaged, move to his support; otherwise you can remain where you now are till we study better the ground. I go to Acworth to-day to make all necessary orders as to roads, supplies, &amp;c.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
