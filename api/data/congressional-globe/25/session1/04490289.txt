charge so infamous and revolting'' I& it the deep
contrition of guilt and mented condemnation that
has sealed your mouths'! or are you transfixed witn
superfluous horror, and struck with silent awe at
the Greatest and Best, who uttered the anathema i
Then prostrate yourselves in the dust, and let this
mighty Juggernaut roll over you without a groan
or a tear. But if there be one independent and
honorable man—as I trust in God there are many
—let him stand forth and deny this base charge.
Let this little band of Conservatives upon this floor,
if ihey are fighting for principles, and not for spmls,
raise the banner of independence, and meet their
destiny like men ; otherwise thev must soon sink
into utler oblivion and merited contempt Already
a black cloud hangs impending over your heads,
and its sulphurous fires, lighted up by the midnight
torch oí locofocmsm, will soon burst upon you,
more terrible than that storm of fire and brimstone
that overwhelmed the devoted cities of Sodom and
Gomorrah ; and, without independence and firm-
ness, jou will go down to your political graves

SPEECH OF MR.  LOOMIS
Of Ohio,
[As reported by the National Inteili «-encer j
In the House of Represent/lines, September 21, 1837—The
bill to postpone the fouith instalment of the payment to the
States being undei con«iderat'on—
Mt LOOMIS of Oluo, addressed the committee to the fol
lowing effect
Mt Chairman Believing that the faith of the United btates
and the interests of the State which I have the honor to rcpre
sent in part, are deeply concerned in the fate of the measure
now under discussion, I have felt it my duty to ask theindul
gence of the committee whilst I present the views and oo ibide
rations which wili influence my action upon that iiip isuie It
is no part of my pree nt purpose, sn, to dtscu s cithei the po
hcy or propriety oi the enactment whieh profieied to the
States the custody an 1 safekeeping ftheauticip teda cutnu
lationsof theTieasuiy Suffice it to say, that that policy hav
mg after full and amt>le discussion, a tei grave an 1 mature
deliberation, received the constitutional sanuon oi all the de
partments of the Government requisite to its legal ob lgation,
I am not only disposed, but feel myself in the discharge of my
legislative duty bound, so fai as my vote and my voice can
have an influence, to fulfil all the requirments, and to satisfy
all the iu«t expectations which that enactment has excited
It ia not, su, in my judgment, material to determine whether
the States have, or have not, in strict, legal, technical language,
a vested right to the fourth instalment, contemplaied by the dp
positeact So far as relate  to the three first instalments
which have been deposited with them, 1 entertain no doubt
that they have acquired vested rights and valuable mteics *¡3
entitled to legal and constitutional piotection The ¡sutes
have a perfectnght to the custody and benefit of those msial

on the first days of April, July, and October, all of the same

thirty six It is true that it did not provide Jbi the deposite
