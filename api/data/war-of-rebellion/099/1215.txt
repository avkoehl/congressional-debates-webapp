HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, February 17, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE JACKSON,

Commanding Post:

COLONEL: Captain Grainger's presence about the railroads is now so necessary from the increased demands for transportation as to render it impossible for his attendance with the guard to the removal of cotton secreted in the city. Until further orders, the major-general commanding desires that you will assign Captain Toomer, assistant quartermaster of your command, to the duty of removing the cotton to the depots. Captain Huggins will furnish all necessary wagons.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS S. PARKER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
