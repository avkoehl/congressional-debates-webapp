HDQRS. DIST. OF TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, AND ARIZONA,Houston, Tex., December 1, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Expedition has sailed from New York for Texas. I find this district sadly in want of more light artillery. Please give an order for two batteries to be turned over to lieutenants whom I have sent to Jackson, Miss., to receive them from Columbus.

J. BENKHEAD MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DIST. OF TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, AND ARIZONA,Houston, Tex., December 1, 1862.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON,

Commanding Department of the Mississippi:

SIR: An immediate invasion of Texas being expected, and finding this district sadly indeed of light artillery, I have the honor to request that you will send me in charge of lieutenants two batteries, with a full supply of ammunition, from Columbia, Miss. I understand there is a good earl of artillery at that place, and I trust you will be able at once to comply with my request. I find that the small battery of light artillery known as the Valverde Battery, attached formerly to Sbiley's brigade, has been ordered and has gone forward to join General Holmes' command. Want of time prevents me from obtaining orders in regard to this matter from Richmond.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding.
