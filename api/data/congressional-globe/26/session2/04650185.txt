to set them up, though I might remain down i
would n< t have them up for ,fnj purpcs" not avow
ed in 1833, when they orgamz d I eoutd not
wish them down, therefore, except to establish their
own view  and policy This, sir, is what certain
practicable gentlemen are pleaded to cal! an "di-
straction," which renders m  imprac'icabi'e Never-
iheles , it is with me a pleasmj "abstracii'n"-Xorie
that I cheush as I love truih and rec ilude.
Pat this colleague of mine down' No, sir 'He
is bone of my bone and flesh of my fles.h. For
that, and oiher reasons, I do not wish to see him
prostrate His errors I would gladly put down ÍH
him, not through him I feel too much interest in
him, to see him made ihe instrument of effec'ing
mi chief h«nce the freedom, the candor and fideli-
ty I have always exercised tt wards him, above all
others.
He says I endeavor to prepare the people of
Georgia o believe that he and his party are advo-
cating a tariff. In this he has made a mistake
He must allude to the gentleman from Virginia,
[Mr. Wise,] and two olher ot his colleagues,
[Messrs Buck and Alpord,] each of whom di-
rectly charged him and certain othcis from the
South, who spoke with him on cenaw quesnons,
with yielding lo tariff influences, and of indirectly
supporting a protective principle Why does my
colleague forego the reply to those gentlem-n, (two
of whom are still in his own party almement,) to
make a ihrust at m 1 I have made no al'usion to
the sublet, be.ng absent during th t debate But
having seen my colleague's speech, I take oc-
casion here to say, that the sentiments it con-
tains, connected with what is doing and say-
ing here, satisfy me il at the charge made
by those gentlemen is not without foundation
I regret lhat he made that speech It «.ho<rs
too great indifference to the piotective ¡n maple In
it he said just what the friends of protection wanted
him to say To make it safe for him to 'ay thi?,
they venture to aver lhat they no Ion er wish a high
protective tariff H re is tie common ground of
union; and when Souihern members shall have
gone thus far to meet the "power m esse north, of
the Potomac," another compro nise will be neces-
sary to distmauisn between a high and i low pro-
tective tariff, and lo enabie Soutnerr rre ober-who
havs taken th s "power in esse" fcrth^ir "auxili-
ary" lo persuade the people at home, tba1 a high
protective tauff is within ihe compromise
Again, sir that speech «hows tvo gre^t indiffe-
rence to tne views of a very large portion of that
party n Georgia to which I belonged, and s id be
long, if ihere be one such, called the Stale Right*
party. I know th°re ¡s none such, however, since
it has dissolved. From Flint river to the western
border of Georgia, almost every man of that order
agrees with me, ¡>nd differs fiom my colleague in
tttis they make no distirction betwe-n the doctrino
of State Rights and Nullification, and do not expect
him to claim the "exclusive" title of State Rights
representative, and we heie todi parage the Nuili
fiers they are identical By his speech he sl-ows
a willingness to sm'; ihose principle?, for the mere
gratification of disparaging one distinguished name
connected with their history, and is prepared to go
out of his -way to strike tie blow
But whodo°s my colleague mean by "fas party1*'
Does he mean the Whig party here' If so, Idocharge,
and would make the people of Georgia believe
(and my colleague al«o, if I vete m t sure he
knows it,) that hs party are the adiocatos cf a
protective tariff, and the only party that aoe advo-
cate that policy. And I r ow claim the right, as. a
constituent to address him, and tell him he must
abandon allthepol ey heretofore supported by him
and myself, or qua lhat parly I cannot too much
admire the very upright view presented by the ho-
norable member from Kentucky, [Mr Under-
wood,] who said "it is use>ess to try to argie when
there are vital differences on principle, there must
be a split or a yielding of principle" Take the
ground of the gentleman from the Norfolk district,
[Mr. MaLLORY,] lay down your cardinal points, and
sey if the Harrison party oppose th^e, I oppose them,
if they support th se, I support them. Tnen my
colleague and I could agreo, fur, if the Whig part/
sustain the measures proposed by that gentleman,
[Vlr Mallory ] I am will n¡* to go with >hem I
know my col eague and h s party are opposed to a
protective tariff, but, with a'l his oppoiititn to it,
he is indirectly sustaining that policy by promoting
and sustaining in power the only party who advo-
cate it He surely d es (his knowingly How,
then, can he object to their course or to them, when
th y shall-enact what every one knows to be their
polioj'*
He says "I have attempted to school him "
How' When or where? N/rt by my speeches—
not on this floor No, sir, th->t can't be said. It is
true, lhat since 1832, he-ind I have been po'riical-
!y intimate, and always personally so With a
^freedom and cand.oríbat was authorized anddemand-
Cl bLquj; .relations, I haveplacedmy views, and the
reasons for them, before him, bu' never in a manner
unkind or unbecoming those relations. Bemgof the
¡same family, I had a strong desire to see him at
all times in the position of strength—one that I
could always sustain Withm the last twelve
months, however, the prospect of realizing that has
vanished It has been put out of my v ew by the
exhibition of a certain pliable material in him,
which caused him to yield certain p ints I never
expected bim to surrender But I have not at-
tempted to "scnooi him " So far from it, 1 made
no abusión to him m my remarks in reply to the
gentl m n from Ohio, [Mr Giddinos ] If seemed
to suit his purpose, and that of others, to convert
it into a "family quarrel," instead of joining me
and my colleagues in repelling the attack of the
membeisfrom Ohu and Maine. It my colleague
had joined me in the defence, the entire forces of
the assailants would have showed tl emselves, from
Ohio, from Maine, from Massachu rtts, from New
York, C< nnec icut, Vermont, and e'sewhere, -md
we all should have hadenougito do Instead of
that, he chose to c neihate and keep doun the
assailants forces by turning upon hi coll gfrues
In a vtry short time, his co'lf agues will be entitled
to their discharge, leaving only him and those who
agree with him the battle field He will then have
full scope foi his ' zeal for Northern inte-eJs"
And we shall'ee how henil manage to s knee
the fiie o< the enemv'oguns, and after lakmg them
to hi bo om, and giving th m the vanlage ground,
how he will rep*l their atiack We shall also lean
what that "auxiliary ttt esse North of the Potomac"
will avail him.
My (ol'eaguec'aims the peculiar offre of r-pr -
sentirg Stale Rights men We know, sir, he was
sent here lor that purpo e, but why di es he sit si
lent on this fljor, opening a t his mouth, v-hilst a
host, wito bitterness on their tongue, in the ranks
oí his own Whig asocíales, a'e daily abusing, re
vihrjg, a. d scoffing at the Nullifiers and ih"ir doc
trines' Why does he umtr with them and travel
out of his way to ridicule and bring into disrepute
whit he and others call "Southern abstractions'!"
Why d os he a tempt to blend, confuse and con
found the principles of the S a'e R ghts psrty with
thos  of t1 e Federal party' Why does he give his
sanction to the profe«srou tha' Federalism is a
Sti'e R gbU vie x of our system' If to s Le repre-
senlalun lien in leed he Will be perfectly in oider
to represent anli-tanff constituents and defend a
protective tariff
He says he is a "strict constructionist," "a Pha-
mpe of the Pharisees," and yet, to malí  hitrse'f
practicable, he is practically jieldmg all construe
tion To avoid being cahed "rigid," he v II meet
the "power in esse north of th' Potomac ' on com-
mon ground
What does he ffean by thi "power m esse north
of the Polomaci" Will he desígnale t by mea
sure , or interests, or the names of men' Ii is in
cumbent on my colleague to define his position It
is his error, or his waknts , thai, amidst th- flow-
er  of rhetoric and itn charms of oratory, he he
comes conspicuously obscure
He sajs I mt ma ed in my reply to the member
from Ohio, that my colleagues were missing In
this he is wholly wrong Nothing was further
from whit I did and said On the contraty, I gave
evidence of their presence, by turn ng to tnem and
asking them to bear witness to the grounds taken
by the members They were all present, and, as i
thought, they prepared to repel  the attack, and I
doubt not would have done 50, but for an appre-
hension that it might make the battle too conspicu-
ous. We are gUd they yet have influence enough
by entreaty or otherwi e 10 ,iU*ce a part of the
enemy's artillery It will at lea<t enable those of
us who have been in the front of the engagement,
to retire, wounded, as we are by our adversaries in
front, and our friends in the rear. We hope the
post of honor will be soon assigned to our colleague,
and that, freed from the annoyance of missiles from,
a friend at his back, he may have the glory of the
victory. He asks you "who I am?" and answers
his own question by saying, I am "one a?amst
whom the voice of condemnation is gone forth;
that my constituents have not believed me, and
will not believe me again " He stales truly, in
part, but, you have been told before, is not entitled
to the credit of giving you the first information. He
would not have repeated it, but to purchase to him.
self a momentary gratification, which being abstain-
ed from, would have done his heart and his head
more credit. That my eons'ituenls have not be-
lieved me is af mined, but for that they are not to
blame If there shall be a loss, it js then s. They
are in pursuit of their own happiness, and
should pursue it in their ewn way. They
should effect it by agento of th ir own choos-
ing. It would haví been unwise m them
to have attempted to effect their object by Aft
agent who differed from them as to the course to
be adopted It is not for me to decide whether they
have acted wnely m selecting one who has no po-
I cy of his own touching their happiness, that be
may not yield, for the honor cf serving them, no
opinions wbico he holds too rigid y, to prevent a
mee'mg between h m and his "auxiliary power in
esse north of ihe Po'cmac "
Wheiher they "toi I disbelieve" me or not, I have
never stopped to inquire, ni r do I now So long as
the duties of a station assigred to me by them re-
quire me to d clare what I know, and testify fo
what I see, I sh ill not ask whe her I shall be be-
lieved It is my pan to state truth—theirs to be-
lieve or dishei eve Neither can I eter consent to
remodel or mwify the truth, for Ihe credit o(
being 'believed ''
My colleasue says, ! his is wholly the antagonist
po ltion to mine m politics " I am only surprised
at the can hd avowal on this floor If he had said
it twe ve months ago, my s ¿rin-e would have pro-
ceedel fiom anuttier cause But how is it we are
ant-gorus* ' Is it m reference to our views of go-
vernment' he principles of Jefferson, put forth by
our pirty m 1833' I app ebi 'id it 1=, and I hope
he will deal as candidly with all his constituents as
he has with me J still h Id lo them, and act on,
th°m If he is my antagonist, he has become so by
an abandonment of them  ince we w^re elected
When we carne here in 1839, we agreed also in
measu~ei It we m w differ, be ba« changed E*pe-
c ally did we agree in ihe purpose to oppose the
Wh g pa'ty ai d their measures, Bank, 'anff, inter-
nal lm^ovemert, national deb', etc Howisithe
now is my antagomsl The fact lhat he chose
Harri on, and 1 Van Buren, did rot make us so,
since by the fiimer he expect d to accomplish the
same which I proposed through the latter He
■w is told b fore making that declaraticn, that if
ihe Whig Administration policy should prove wbat
he once though', and what a Sue Rights Vtrgima
member, [Vir Mallory ] a Whig, s ill thought; I,
tor one, should sustain it as freely as I had Mr.
Van BurenS This difference, therefore, can never
make us antagonst., and I caniiow assure him,
ibat if he is sincere in his pro^e^ion of "strict con-
struction, * the StaeRiifits principles of '98, m
his oppo t on to a United States Bank, protective
If riff, internal impi jvements, ¿nd a public debt in
time cf peace, I will consent not to yield these mea-
sures and principle?, either to be ' believed" at home
or to conciliate "apowerinessenorthoflhe Potomac "
He will find ltimpo sib'e to le antagonistical to
me, urless there caa be "an antagoirst who is not
an opporent
What I have witnessed at this pkee, sir, reminds
me forcibly of a remaik once made to me by one
of Georgia's most gifted sons, row no more—one
who was eminently dis'tngu shed for the clearness
of his conceptions, the brevity and force of big
