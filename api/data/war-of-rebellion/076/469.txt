HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 11, 1864.

General HOWARD:

The transfer of the Ninth Ohio was made permanent, at Colonel Hamilton's representation that he belonged to no brigade and had 400 men. General Schofield having lost General Stoneman needs cavalry on his flank. We must put our joint shoulders to the wheel and scrape up all the horses we can, else the enemy will ride all around an over us.

General SHERMAN:

I have not the slightest objection to the transfer of the Ninth Ohio Cavalry. I found it in this command, and was using a portion of it. Every effort to secure cavalry will meet with my hearty co-operation.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM T. CLARK,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department and Army of the Tennessee:

COLONEL: Brigadier-General Corse reports to me to-night that he has put nine companies in reserve. General Corse says he has been obliged to put one regiment more on his left to connect with the Twentieth Army Corps. He has one regiment and two companies on the skirmish line, which takes all of his command except nine companies, as stated. His men have been in the trench now two days and nights without relief. I do not think I can relieve him, for General Ransom has one regiment on his left as a reserve to cover the gap between him
