COLONEL: The brigadier-general commanding authorizes you to give the assurance to the enemy that the burial party sent out by them for the purpose of burying the bodies of those of our men who may be close to their lines will not be fired upon. None of the enemy, however, but the burial party will be permitted to advance from their lines. If the enemy will permit the bodies to be brought in and buried by our own men, it would be preferable.
