FLAG-STEAMER PHILADELPHIA, Off Morris Island, September 7, 1863.

General Q. A. GILLMORE, U. S. Army,

Commanding Department of the South, Morris Island, S. C.:

GENERAL: I desire to procure as large a side-wheel steamer as can cross this bar, to be used as a ram against the obstructions in the channel between Sumter and Moultrie. Have you a fast steamer under charter that could be used for this service, such, for instance, as the Spaulding, or one of greater draught of water? I have not a suitable one at my disposal.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. A. DAHLGREN,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron.

MORRIS ISLAND, September 8, 1863-1 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Your dispatch of 11.15 to-day and your letter of yesterday are just received. As soon as I can get any good guns on Cumming's Point, I will use them whenever you prefer. I am just dispatching a letter by one of my aides to explain my views more fully.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, September 8, 1863-2.30 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

I am going to assault Fort Sumter to-night.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.
