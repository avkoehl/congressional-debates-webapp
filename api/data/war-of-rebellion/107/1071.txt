WASHINGTON, July 7, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

Mr. PRESIDENT: After having complied with my instructions on being relieved of the command of the Army of the Potomac, I came to Washington for the purpose of seeking an interview with yourself and the Secretary of War. This morning I have been placed in arrest by order of the major-general commanding the Army for visiting Washington without a pass. It is almost unnecessary for me to add that in my previous visits to this city this rule was never enforced in my case. Under the usages of services it is not considered proper to call on superior officers except with their consent, and I therefore request that His Excellency will have me informed whether or not he will grant me an audience for half an hours, and if so, appoint the time I can have the honor to meeting him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.
