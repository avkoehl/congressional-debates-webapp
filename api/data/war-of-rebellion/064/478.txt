Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF COLORADO,Denver, Colo. Ter., June 20, 1864.

Captain J. C. DAVIDSON,

Firt Cavalry of Colorado:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your report of the 19th instant, and have noted its contents. From the facts therein set forth, and the fact that your horses must be pretty well used up, and also from fact that our telegraphic communication with department headquarters is interrupted, and probably will be for three or four days, I consider that it will be better for you to halt your command and await orders. You will select a camp where there is good grass, as near your present encampment as practicable, and remain a few days or until orders are received, which may give time enough for your stock to pick up. Where is Camp Canby?

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. S. MAYNARD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE NORTHWEST,Milwaukee, June 20, 1864.

Brigadier General H. H. SIBLEY,

Commanding District of Minnesota, Saint Paul, Minn.:

GENERAL: Captain Fisk, assistant quartermaster, proposes to leave the upper Minnesota about July 1 with a train of emigrants for Idaho. He will follow the route by way of Grand River, and will, on his way to the Missouri, pass the post to be located on James River. If it is found necessary, in your judgment, please direct a short his train part of the way across to the Missouri. You are the proper judge whether such an escort is needed between the post on James River and the Missouri at the mouth of Grand River. If you can spare a piece of artillery (without horses or men) please let Captain Fisk have it.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
