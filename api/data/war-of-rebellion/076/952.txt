Major General P. R. CLEBURNE:

GENERAL: General Lee does not wish Govan's brigade to be returned to him, as it was his intention to have ordered it back to you. He thinks, however, it would be well to make the inquiry as to what orders General Govan acted under.

General FERGUSON, Commanding, &amp;c.:

Your note of 3.30 received. The general desires you to, take sufficient force and ascertain what the movement means. Leave a regiment on the right, and report your departure to the officer commanding the infantry. Keep us informed of your movements. Send certain information to General Wheeler of this movement. Say that we have some information which rather leads to the belief that the enemy has a cavalry force intended to pursue him or make another raid.

Above dispatch duplicated at 5.50 p. m., with instructions to leave General Morgan in command of cavalry on right.
