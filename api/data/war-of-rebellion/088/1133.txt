Your line will leave the intrenchments at the most suitable point for making an effective communication between the Weldon railroad and the right of your troops in the field. You will intrench.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 30, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Beside the fine assault of the intrenchments by General Griffin to-day, of which I have already spoken, I cannot omit to mention officially the gallant manner in which he advanced and met the enemy's attack this evening and the steadiness with which his excellent division received the enemy's fire and poured in their own, effectually checking their most persistent efforts to advance.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 30, 1864-11.45 p. m. (Sent 12 midnight.)

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you send out a strong reconnaissance at daylight to-morrow to ascertain the position of the enemy, and that you advance your pickets well out at the same time. General Parke is similarly directed. General Gregg is ordered to move out the Miss Pegram road for reconnaissance.

Lieutenant-Colonel PARKER,

Headquarters Lieutenant-General Grant:

General Warren is now at Poplar Grove Church; has drawn the enemy's fire, developing their force. He is trying to advance still. General Parke is trying to go around Warren's left. General Gregg is still farther to the left on the Vaughan road but has a very heavy force in his front. Signal officers report a massing of troops, infantry and artillery, on our left.
