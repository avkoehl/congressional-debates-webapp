THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 28,
the Treasury, upon this very question ot dis-
cretionary authority conferred upon the Secre-
tary:
"A wide discretion should be intrusted to the offi-
cer charged with the duty of negotiating loans in
order that ho may be enabled to avoid unexpected
difficulties, occasioned by possible conditions of the
money market. This delicate and responsible duty
must necessarily be intrusted to somebody, and the
people can have no other reliable security for faith-
fulness than may be found in the established char-,
acter of the individual chnrged with so important a
trust, whoever he may be."
Now, sir, what are the discretionary powers
conferred on the Secretary of the Treasury?
First, we authorize him to employ private
agents; and it is proposed, to avoid this, to
require ail the operations of negotiating this
loan to be done by the Treasury Department.
Why, sir, that is practically impossible. Every
nation in Europe, and our own rlation in three
memorable periods, have found it to be prac-
tically impossible. Tire machinery of the
Treasury Department is not adapted for the
negotiation of these loans. Therefore even the
powerful Governments of Great Britain, of
Russia, of France, all resort to private bankers
or agents to carry on the operation Of funding
their debt. AH railroad corporations and alt
associations seeking to borrow money in the
money markets of the world must seek these
intermediate agencies.
Three times during the war we tried to avoid
it. Mr. Chase, when Secretary of the Treas-
ury, tried to negotiate the five-twenty loan
through the Treasury Department, and failed
utterly for more than a year, nntil finally he,
under similar authority to that conferred in
this bill, employed private agents, who within
six or eight months from that time sold the
whole loan. So Mr. Fessenden, when Secre-
tary of the Treasury* undertook to carry on a
negotiation by the aid of the national banks
and the Treasury Department, and he finally
in his report said that he found himself unable
to get the requisite motley in that Way, ahd was
compelled to resort to private agencies. So
with Mr. McCulloch under similar circum-
stances. Here the authority is conferred to em-
ploy agents with limited power and with limited
pay; and if you will not trust the Secretary
of the Treasury with these discretionary powers
of course you may so cripple and tie op his
hands as to prevent hind from negotiating this
loan.
There is another difficulty presented, I think,
for the first time in this bill. There is author-
ity granted in this bH! to employ foreign 8gents,
or rankers in foreign reentries'. Although in
some of the loan laws passed during the War
the authority was granted to negotiate bonds
in Europe, yet I do not find in any of the loan
laws express authority to 'employ agents ifi
foreign countries, although that has often been
done by the Government of the United States,
But here the authority is expressly given. The
reason for it is that the great mass of our
public d6bt which can be funded at a low rate
of interest is now held abroad. Mr. Wells,
in his annual report, made here recently,
estimates the amount held in Europe at
$1,000,000,000. I believe he hps overstated
it; but at to® same time I believe it approaches
$1,000,000,000> or aboutonohalf of the funded
debt of the United-States. The rate of interest
in foreign countries is lower than in this coun-
try, and it is therefore probable that we can
negotiate bonds on more favorable terms abroad
than here. All this is left to the discretion
of the Secretary. He is authorized to nego-
tiate bonds at home and abroad, and to do
it either through the agency of the Treas-
ury Department or1 private agents here or in
Europe. He is also authorized to printon the
face of these bonds the payment of interest in
the coin of the country In which they are nego-
tiated. He is authorized to pay the interest in
thalers, in francs, in sterling, in order to avail
himself of the lowest possible rate of interest.
I hope that this part of the measure will finally
lead to what his been so eagerly sought for by
the honorable Senator from Massachusetts and
myself, an international coinage. It is very
easy now, if we could approach this question
as practical business men, to adopt a coinage
unit as the standard for all the civilized nations
of the world.
It has been a theme for poets and statesmen
now for more than a generation. There is a
concurrence of opinion in Europe and in Amer-
ica in favor of the adoption of a system of
international coinage which now I believe will
lead to practical results. A very slight change
in the coinage of Germany and France and
England and our own country wilLenable us to
make our national coins convertible one into
the other without any loss by exchange, and I
have the hope that this measure, now for the
first time transferred to oar diplomatic service,
will be brought about by the common consent
of the different nations affected. It will be
one of tho greatest reforms in modern times
when five francs will be a dollar, five dollars
will be a pound sterling, ten florins will be a
pound, and the eagle of America will be the
international unit of the civilized world. Then
the coin of all modern nations may travel any-
where in the pockets of the citizens of all
nations, interchangeable in every country, its
value fixed upon its face, and of universal and
unvarying circulation. I have no doubt that
this measure will tend eventually to the adop-
tion of such a system of international coinage,
and in that aspect it will be a scientific as well
as a financial benefit.
I wish now, Mr, President, to call the atten-
tion of the Senate very briefly to the sinking-
fund section of this bill. Section seven pro-
vides for the appropriation from the duties on
imported goods of $150,000,000 in gold per
annum, applicable first to the payment of the
interest and then to the payment of the princi-
pal. The amount of the interest on the public
debt is now about onehundred and twenty-five
millions, so that this is an appropriation of
$25,000,000, or one per cent, of the principal,
to be kept as a perpetual sinking fund, the
operation of which will payoff every dollar of
our indebtedness, old and new, in from twenty-
five to thirty years, depending somewhat on
the changes in the value of oar bonds.
This is not only a wise financial policy) but
it is the result of an express stipulation in the
law. In theact to which I referred awhilo ago,
of February 25, 1862, we stipulated that until
the debt was paid we would appropriate one
per cent, of the debt every yearto form a sinking
fund for the extinguishment of the principal of
the debt. Thiabill organizes the sinking fund
on a new plan, which, without any risk of mis-
application, will extinguish the debt within the
period stipulated in the bonds. The United
States has in substance faithfully and honestly
observed this stipulation. During the war it
could not do it; it was idle to do it. During
war a sinking fund is a delusion; a sinking
fend eaunotoperate except from a surplus rev-
enue. All the theories that have grown oat of
the experiment in England have been shown
to be delusive, except in a state of peace, and
when there is a surplus revenue* Then the
application of a sinking fund is like Aladdin's
lamp, it works wonders ; but when there is no
surplus revenue, as in time of war, a sinking
fond is as delusive as a dream.
I said that the United States had constantly
maintained the integrity of this sinking fund,
not in the form provided by the law, but by an
actual payment of a greater amount of the debt
than was stipulated. I have in my hand a table
which I will hand the reporter, showing the
amount paid each year since the close of the
war on the principal of the pablic debt:

i Notb.—In this statement no aeconnt is taken of the
accrued interest due at eaeh period. because tho debt
statements prior to March 1,1869, do not show how
much it was, and there are no records in the Depart-
i ment prior to that time which will show it. The pre-
sumption is that it was about tho same at each period
taken. The Pacifio railway bonds are deducted as
not a honnfide debt, but tho pension fnnd is included.
The gold certificates are oHset by apart of the amount
counted as cash on hand. The purchased bonds aro
deducted as in effect part of tho debt redeemed
though not canceled.
The aggregate principal of the debt March' 1,1866,
after deducting $3,994,000 Pacific railway bonds
and $12,627,600 certificates for gold deposited, (at
which time there was no Navy pension fund which
is not properly a debt,) was $2,811,247,359 46
