HARRISBURG, May 26, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Your dispatch this morning relieves me as to equipments and arms, and I presume the Commissary Department will supply our volunteers. I wish Dodge ordered to place himself under my orders and assist me. He has experience that will be useful. Captain Lane has offered and can be of great service. We can enlist 500 men in Franklin and Fulton Counties, but as there is great alarm on the border they had better be armed and equipped and marched in the direction of Hagerstown. The people are enrolling all over the State, and my only fear is we will have more than can be equipped and armed. I desire that the various officials of the Government shall provide transportation and subsistence promptly, and that Captain Dodge be directed to assist me.

Rest assured that there is no want of harmony in our intercourse. I only wish authority and assistance, and Pennsylvania shall far exceed all the previous efforts to crush the rebellion.

A. G. CURTIN.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Our people about entrance to Cumberland Valley are alarmed, and say no defense can be made but at the crossing, and they fear an early attempt in immense force. Cannot our and other State troops be ordered in that direction? Please give this your early attention and reply.

General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General:

Regiments at Philadelphia ready to move under the late requisition of the President are not up to standard required by War Department, but are full under the militia law of Pennsylvania, in accordance with which our organizations of militia must be made. Let me urge you to recognize the organizations as they are.

Telegraph of 25th just received. Unfortunately we have no militia in Vermont, but we will recruit volunteer regiments and batteries with utmost vigor and energy and send to you. After one infantry regiment is raised, or nearly so, shall the next be a regiment of infantry or four or more batteries of artillery?
