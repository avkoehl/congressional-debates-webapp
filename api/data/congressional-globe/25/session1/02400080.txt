that slavery of the South, so much denounced by
so many of its organs and advocates upon both
sides ot the Atlantic, it controls the value of slave
labor and the price of all its products Cotton r ses
or falls, as the bank desires to sell or to purchase,
and so doe-- every other commodity affected by the
price of our gieat staple And shall I, an advo-
cate of free trade, an opponent of tariff or bank
monopolies, be asked to place my constituents and
their propelty beneath the control of this, pow erft 1
institution, by giving it a new charter from this
Government, or by making it a depository of the
national revenue'' And, if not, shall I be asked to
cieate a still more powerful institution, to regulate
mce than eight bundled State banks—to legulate
this.very Bank of the United States—and control
Üu Tice of all pioperty and all products'' Who
does not ^ee, that before a )cai, the pre
stdent of the present Bank of the United
States, with his great American and British
allies and stockholders, would be at the head
of the new institution, with ma eased and in-
creasing powei, and the oid bank, and the de
pendent State institutions, all regulated by the new
bank potentate, would be but the subjects, existing
by the forbearance of the mighty paper momrch
And shall I aid in cieating this enormous, this irre-
sistible central power1* Shall I give it this triumph
over the neople and over the States'! subjecting the
price of all then property, and all their products, to
its expansions and contractions and following, to
some distant capital, the seat of the new moneyed
power, with my constituents as captive^, suppliant
captives, in the triumphal pioeession of this more
than Roman conqueror No one acquainted v\ ith
political economy can deiiv that the power w Inch
creates and regulates the issues of paper money,
and augments oi dim msh.es it at it  pleasure, and
thus malíes money plenty or scarce, does control
the price of all pioperty and all pioducts, and the
wages of labor and industry This is the very
íegulatmg powei claimed ioi the bank and its ad-
vocates Tne tariff controlled the puisuits and
business of men—giving tempoiary and aitificil
sucefss to one branch ot mdustiy, and one section
of the country, by the entire overthrow oí othei
branches of industry, and other sections ot the
Union But this is worse than the tariff, foi that
at least was regulated by the icpresentalives oí
the people and of the States, whilst this is a <-ieat
irrespoiisib'e powei, placed b> us chart lira
series ot }cais, above aid b jond he p"<>r>' i's
manageis not chosen b\ the peop i oi sublet to
then mstiuctions or reca!, but e'ectmg it o\\ n orh-
cers, responsible on j to the powei oi the 1 ink it
self, and deciding in secret conclave upon the des
times oí the nation, and ths puce ol all the pro
ducts and ..II ll e property of evety citizen
And who will -isk, not meHy the le establish
ment of a similar poser vnd similar n stitution,but
the creaüoi of a new and infinitely greatei powei—
a mighty n stitution, capible of controlling thefor-
mei regulator, and all its dependent coiporalions'i
Who does not see that such a bank, u ith s ich ic-
gulating and contro ling novv<ns -would be stronger
than the Government itself, and would control a'l
its opeiations, either as Us ally oi conqueror"? If
it came as an ally—as it must be—of the Admini-
straron which created it, it would unite here the
powers of the bank and the Government, and Ur
mínate in a sordid central despotism Talk not of
the President o> Congress of ..lit people, w hen such
an institution shall hive been ci paled Oirreal
President would be the president ot the bank—cur
real legislators the director  of (hit institution, and
the States—tne Slates, subdued bj the sa ne influ-
ence—«on djgradually sink as undiscoverable spots
upon the oro o' a resistless cential power An am-
bitious Pies dent, aided and sustained bv such i
ternhcandcoiuip irgirfluence,eould indeed strip ns
in a few jeiis (fill but the forms of const tutional
freedom, and tr° Government would be merged m
the bank, or the bank be n crged 11 the Govern-
ment This merger took p tee n Fiance, in 1718,
between the bank and the Government, a id it has
nearly taken place in Gieit Bi tain Here the
union would be inevitable wheneiei the bank
places a prendentm powei,and succeeded,thiough
him, in obtaining a chaiter
Yes, the creation of this great bank powei, to
become the ally of the British bank and bankers,
is indeed a question not only affecting the forms of
our Government here, but a question whethei these
States shall be re-colonized—whether the English
bank, ana its Ameiican allies, shall regulate all our
commerce, and the price of all our products It
is now boldly asked, that England should have a
va=t circulation of gold and silvei,but that we
should have verv little silver, and no gold, and
substitute bank paper, controlled bv the power
which íelains the metals That money should be
debised in value here, to enable England to control
oui business and circulation—that England may sell
her imports here at our paper p-ices, whilst she
givesü for our exports the diminished price arising
fiom a metallic or chiefly metallic currency No
nation could long stand the opei ation of such a
system, but the expoitmg States, the price ot whose
stap'e depends chiefly upon the English maiket,
and not the amount of American paper money,
would soon be reduced to absolute bankruptcy
With the expansion of the paper money here, ev ery
article the planter desires to purchase w ould be
enhanced m price, whilst his cotton, regulated by
the English market and currency, would remain
nearly stationary, till soon the expense of raising
cotton would be so greatly increased, whilst the
puce of the article remained nearly the same, that
little oi no profit would be derived from the cul-
ture It is. not the nominal paper prices of pro-
pel ty here that gives real prosperity to the planter,
but the nett profit upon the staple he raise , m cal-
culating which the expenses oí* íaising the artiele,
arising from the expansion ot American paper
money, is precisely so fai a diminution of his ptoftts
Upon the exporting States, then, is thrown neaily
the whole burden of this system Thev paitict-
pitf  m all the evils of an explosion, and
during the expanding piocess, whilst they give
more tor every article connected with conducting a
plantation, their great staple experiences no corre-
spondent use, being governed by the less inflated
I uropean monev market To illustiate itus posi-
tion, suppose, from the absence of bank paper, the
expense m Egypt, the East Indias, or Brazil, of
raising cotton, including the interest on capital,
was one cent per pound, whilst here from ihe pa-
per expansion, it was six cents pei pound, how long
could we withstand the competition—the cotton ot
all other countues bunging m Europe tie same
puce as oui own' Is it not evident, that a lew
\ears moie of expansion of the 'Vmencan paper
system would reduce the exporting States to abso
lute bankmptcv, and the whole countrj to the most
abject dependence on the money power oi Fug
land—sdhng high hei impoits here by the false
standard of our paper money, and purchasing low
all our exporffat the price regulated by her less in-
flated currency1 In tins way, England would vast-
ly íetaid our actual increase of national wealth, by
selling hei imports to us at our paper prices, for a
vast amount, and giving us a less price foi our ex-
ports, estimated by hei nearer approach to a me-
tallic currency Is it not seen, in this exchange of
imports for expoits, we get, for the same money,
fewer imports, and England moie exports, by the
piecise ratio m which imports aie raised in price
here bj our paper money, and exports depiessedby
being measuied by a currency more nearly metal-
1 c, and thus the whole nation sustains a great lossi
It wou d be most curious and instructive to "om-
pare tables from 1800 to the present period, repre-
senting the prices current of cotton ol domestic
produce consumed wholly in the United States, and
the amount of papei circulation These tables I
have neither had the time or opportunity to pre-
pare, but this much must be known to every Sena-
tor, that as the paper monev, before an explosion,
lose in amount, domestic produce rose also, whilst
cotton at the same period upealedly fel—.being
regulated by the European money maiket One
fact alone will be conclusive evidence of the princi-
ple, that whilst fioffi 1815 to 182o the puce  of our
cotton, including Sea Island, aveiaged eighteen
cents per pound, from the latter period to 1815,
inclusive, the average price was less than twelve
cents per pound, whilst from 1815 to 1835, our
paper circulatien has nearly doubled    The price
of our cotton, then, ms ead of augmenting
with the increase of our paper money, has
actually gieatly fallen «nciei the opeiatwn The
expanded papei money system operates as a
perpetual tax upon the planter, and nothing is
more clearly demonstrable than that, if every ex-
pense attending the conducting of a cottou plan-
tation, including the property itself, lose in the
same proportion, for the next, as it had done for
the last three j ears, v hilst cotton remained sta
tionary, we should be compelled to abandon the
business as altogether unpiof table
Nor will a rational bank prevent these expan
sions in this or any othei countiy The Bank of
France in 1718, so prosperous in the commence-
ment of its caieei,was soon over-extended, and
burst with a fearful explosion leav ng upon the
hands of the people four hundred millions of wor h-
less paper, spreading in eveiy d rection rum and
dis~nay, and convulsing the v ry foundations of the
Government Paper money was nearly abandoned
in France for moie than hall a cenlmy, anl when
it rose again, out of the horrors of the French i evo-
lution, again it exploded, with consequences, if pos-
sible, more terrific than before, and now no bank no e
under one hund ed dollars is issued in Fr?noe, and
more than three-fourths of her circulation is gold
and silver In this country, vv e see now the great
Bank of the United States, proclaimed by its presi-
dent more powerful under the new tnan the old
chaiter, prostrate and suspended, we see the same
institution in 1819 reduced to the veige of bank-
rup cy, with on  dollar in sp°cie for every bundled
dollars of its notes in circulation, and at the same
period, as well as in 1808 and 1809, we have seen
the State banks failing under the legulations of
the Bank of the United States TIip defect is in the
system, foi it is alike tne interest of a ni lonal as
of State ban's, to expand then issues -vv it¡i the
view of augmenting their profits Expansion is
the vice of the entire system, contraction must soon
follow, and suspension terminates the scene, and
when a national bank suspends, associated as it
must be with the Government, and connected vv ith
all the pursuits and interests of the people, the
catastrophe must be great and overwhelming The
Government which created such a bank, might be
held responsible by the people for the dreadful
calamity, and amid then agony and despair, th y
might seek relief m revolution, Let us be most
thankful that we «ere saved, as it wei° almost by
a muacle, irom th f imr  of the national bank m
1819, and let no friend of this Union ever deslíe to
subject it to a similar ha/ard
But we are told that the State banks cr neaily
all, beai evidtnee to the regu'itin  povveis of the
Un ted States Bank and desire its lechaiter It is
mteiest that prompts this action on the part of the
banks, because, by the creation of a national bank,
the} are enabled lo conduct their business with less
specie, and, consequent!}, w ith mere profit Let
us illustrate this by a few examn'es Without a
gieat oveipowering national bank, suosti'uting Us
paper for specie, the banks of New Orleans and
Natchez must keep in their v aulis a iaiger specie
basis, to supplv the demand of tne up-country tra-
ders and producers, who, upon their return to then
respective States, take home these baiai ces in go d
and silver To meet this demand, these banks
must, in the absence of a national bank, issue less
paper, or keep on hand a larger su] ply of specie
If, then, we look to the p°nod when the Bank of
the United States was in successful operation in the
southwest, the r banks are found to possess very
little specie, and much less specie, as «hown by
the r returns, m propoition to their circulation,
than at the present per oil And w hy is this' The
Circulation of the paper of the Bank of the Umt-d
States, in addition to the amount m the possession
of the State banks, constitutes th ir basis ot opera-
tions, and is substituted for the specie in their
vaults In the mean t me, the paper of the
national bank is substituted for specie in the
general circulation It expels the specie from
the country, or pievents its importation by pre-
venting the use of anl demand for it to settle ba-
lances due m the diffeient States Never, then,
can we hope to have, under such circumstances, as
all experience has proved, any great amount oí
