of Ninety-third Illinois Volunteer Infantry and captured 2 on duty at these headquarters. They also captured 2 wagons - 1 farm wagon from Sixty-third Illinois Volunteer Infantry and 1 forage team detailed for these headquarters. The men killed were murdered in cold blood after being taken prisoner. After the attack on the forage party they charged upon the pickets of this brigade, when they were immediately checked and driven back with a loss, as far as ascertained, of 1 wounded and 1 prisoner. Upon the first alarm this command was ordered under arms, and a regiment thrown forward to the cross-roads, forming a grand guard with the line well extended on either flank. The Fourth Minnesota Volunteer Infantry, Colonel J. E. Tourtellotte commanding, now occupies that position. A picket guard has also been placed on the left flank of the brigade at a point where a road running nearly north crosses the creek. It is ascertained that the attacking party were a portion of the Jeff. Davis Legion, two brigades of whom were hanging on our rear. The brigade occupies and intrenched line to-night.
