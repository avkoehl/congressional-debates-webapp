Colonel G. H. SHARPE,

Assistant Provost-Marshal, Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac:

Fifteen thousand between Weldon and Wilmington said to attack New Berne, but thought to overawe the Union sentiment. General Pickett's force all in North Carolina. Beauregard's, 19,000 all told, in and about Charleston. No troops left Johnston except those on furlough. He has 35,000 men. Longstreet has 20,000; has moved his headquarters to Morristown. Seven thousand of his men are shoreless. Five companies of heavy artillery in defenses of Richmond, four light batteries, two companies cavalry, 120 Greer's [?] men, and city battalion, 640 men. Four citizens soldiers could be turned out. Four hundred cavalry on the Chickahominy, between James and York Rivers. Seven hundred and eighty Maryland Line at Hanover Junction. Lee one month ago had 36,000 besides cavalry brigade. Seventeen hundred left for North Carolina; 6,000 furloughed. Has now 35,000 thousand. Hampton Cavalry, 6,000, and Lomax's brigade, of Lee's division. 1,600, are all the cavalry Lee has. Fitz Lee disbanded 4,000 for want of forage.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Is General Banks preparing an expedition to go up Red River? Boats seem to be assembling at New Orleans for that purpose. I ask, because in that event it will not be necessary for me to send, as contemplated doing on Sherman's return, to the Red River. General Thomas advances this morning.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

If General Schofield is rejected I would prefer Major General J. B. McPherson to all others for his place; General P. H. Sheridan second; General O. O. Howard third choice. I do not know General Stoneman's merits.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General, Commanding.
