General BROWN, Springfield, Mo.:

If a regiment at Neosho would be in danger of being separated from you and forced to fall back into Kansas would it not be better to keep it nearer Springfield? Do not let your command separate so that you cannot concentrate it if necessary. The rebels in North Missouri are gathering in large force, and will doubtless make an effort to break through and reach Arkansas. It is important that you have your command in condition to intercept them should they elude General Totten. Doubtless a strong demonstration will be made from Arkansas at the same time. Do not work your horses down more than necessary, and do not hesitate to supply the places of those which give out by taking horses from rebels. It is important to have your forces where you can concentrate them speedily and in condition to act effectively in any direction.

Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:

Coffee has doubled, and yesterday afternoon was going south near Mount Vernon, our troops in pursuit of him. Rains at the same time with his forces, variously estimated from 500 to 1,500 was moving from Sarcoxie toward Mount Vernon, probably with the intention of a junction with Coffee. I sent troops from here yesterday afternoon to Mount Vernon, but I fear that they will go out of the State before they can be reached.

The raid has been singularly free from the destruction of property or life. I have not heard of any citizen being short or property destroyed. I am much annoyed that they got into the State and out again without being whipped; the fact is that the hard service of our cavalry and want of forage has worn it out, and I am crippled badly. I shall hold on here until I can let them recruit, if possible, placing one regiment at Neosho, with orders, if forced to fall back, to join the command of General Blunt.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General LOAN, Saint Joseph, Mo.:

Please inform me what force you can send after Poindexter and when. He is said to be in Chariton County to-day. He had from 1,200 to 2,000 and increasing. Porter is still north of the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad. I am moving troops toward Poindexter with a view to drive him and Porter toward the northeastern part of the State and compel them to fight. Colonel Merrill will go up the North Missouri Railroad on the 7th, and will take command of all the troops in Northeast Missouri. Keep me advised of the movements of your troops.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.
