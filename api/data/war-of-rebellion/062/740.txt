HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS, &amp;C.,Little Rock, Ark., March 26, 1864-12 p.m.

Colonel F. H. MANTER:

The messenger who left here this morning has been driven back 5 miles from Benton. I inclose copies of two dispatches.* Will answer General Sherman that the expedition left on the 23rd. Captain Carr received a telegram from Colonel Myers, saying,"General Allen telegraphs that no movement will take place in your department," dated 21st.

General Kimball has used, and is using, every exertion possible to remount the cavalry and provide horses for our battery. Four hundred mules have arrived at Devall's Bluff since you left; 100 will be taken to mount cavalrymen; the remaining 300 are hauling new wagons from Devall's Bluff. Clayton telegraphs Lieutenant Greathouse went within 16 miles of Monticello, and that the enemy have fallen back from Branchville to that place. Lieutenant G[reathouse] learned that they are fortifying at Monticello and except some infantry there soon. General Kimball has sent out two cavalry scouts. All quiet here.

Respectfully, yours,
