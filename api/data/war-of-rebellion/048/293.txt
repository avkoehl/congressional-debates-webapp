Numbers 50. Report of Lieutenant Colonel Jonathan H. Lockwood, Seventh West Virginia Infantry.
HDQRS. SEVENTH [WEST] VIRGINIA VOLUNTEERS,January 19, 1864.

SIR: In obedience to orders I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by the Seventh [West] Virginia Volunteers on the 14th of October, 1863, in the engagement at Bristoe Station:

The command marched from camp on the Warrenton road at day-light on the morning of the 14th of October. While crossing Turkey Creek the enemy opened on the column with artillery. An order was received from Brigadier-General Hays, commanding the division, to deploy skirmishers on the right and left flanks of the column. I accordingly deployed five companies of the First Delaware Volunteers, under the command of Major Woodall, and the One hundred and eighth New York Volunteers, under the command of Colonel Powers, the First Delaware on the left and the One hundred and eighth New York Volunteers on the right. The Fourteenth Connecticut Volunteers was formed in line of battle with the right resting on the road, and as the enemy commenced a fire of musketry farther to the left, the First Delaware skirmishers were extended by the left flank, and the Twelfth New Jersey Volunteers were formed in line of battle, facing to the left with the right resting on the left of the Fourteenth Connecticut. Receiving an order from General Hays to advance by a flank on the road and throw flankers on the right, the column then moved on.
