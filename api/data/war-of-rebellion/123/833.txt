Numbers 6. NEW ALBANY, November 7, 1862.

General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I received your dispatch of the 6th instant last evening, asking me to "transmit to your office without delay a report of the vessels composing the ram fleet under my direction, specifying their names and capacity, where and how received, and where and to whom transferred."

I immediately answered by telegraph, giving you the items of information asked for, with a promise of a more detailed report by mail.

Inclosed you will find statement of the cost of each boat, the cost of converting them into rams, and the place where purchased and where fitted up, with a total cost of the fleet as it left here in May last.

I had expected ere this to have made a full report in obedience to the order of the Secretary of War contained in the notice of my appointment as fiscal agent of the fleet, of the 20th of May last; but subsequent to that order he ordered the quartermaster at Cincinnati, who had disbursed the funds there, to send his papers to Washington.
