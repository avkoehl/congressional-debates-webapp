Major General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding Department, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of the 5th instant was received at 10 a. m. yesterday.

Logan's DIVISION is all ready, and will embark as soon as transports can be provided. There are not enough here now, but Graham thinks some will be up this evening. I hope to get away from here with Logan's DIVISION by Tuesday night at latest.

Quinby's DIVISION is just relieved from railroad duty, and marching in to-day. His command will be in good shape, and ready to move at a moment's notice.

Bissell has just shown me an order requiring him to move, with Logan's DIVISION, with his regiment, pontoon train, train, tools, &c., and I have given Graham orders to assign him a boat, which he is now loading.

I hope soon to be with you, and aid in carrying out the plan, which strikes me as the best and most feasible that has been presented.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON.
