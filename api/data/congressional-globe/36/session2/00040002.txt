THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 3,
from the rising of the sun unto the going down
thereof;*and Thou knowestail of our interests,
and Thou knowest all of our dangers. Our good
men are at fault; our wise men are at fault, in the
North and in the South, and in the East and in
the West. Everywhere they are at fault. We
know not what it is best for us to do; and with
common consent we come unto Thee, 0 Lord,
our God, and we pray Thee to overrule unrea-
sonable and wicked men in all parts of our Con-
federacy; and we pray Thee to inspire and to
strengthen and to assist all true patriots in every
part of our Union.
And may Thy blessings rest upon all the de-
partments of the Government. We remember,
, with special solicitude, the President of these Uni-
ted States and his immediate advisers. They lack
wisdom; but if they call upon Thee, Thou wiltgive
them wisdom, for Thou givestto all men liberally,
and upbraidest not. While we trust they pray
for themselves, we here also pray for them, that
Thy Holy Spirit may be granted unto them,and
that they may see exactly what they ought to do,
and have grace to do it in the positions in which
they are placed.
We thank Thee for this bright and beautiful
morning for the assembling of the two Houses
of Congress. And we pray that Thy blessing
may rest upon the Vice President, and upon
every Senator in his place; and upon the Speaker
of this House, and upon every member in his
place. We rejoice to learn that they see their
responsibility; that they feel their responsibility;
and that many of them are looking toward Thee
for counsel and direction. 0 Lord, our God,
let Thy own presence subdue every heart and
every mind, and sanctify all actions to Thy
own glory and the good of our whole people.
Oh, that we may still be happy in this blessed
Union!
Our Father who art in Heaven, hallowed be
Thy name: Thy kingdom come: Thy will be
done, on earth as it is in Heaven: give us this
day our daily bread: and forgive us our debts, as
we forgive our debtors: and lead us not into temp-
tation, but deliver us from evil: for Thine is the
kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever
and ever. Amen.

MESSAGE FitOM TIIE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate by
Mr. Hicicey, one of their clerks, informing the
House that a quorum of the Senate has assembled;
that the Senate is ready to proceed to business,and
has passed a resolution that acommittee, consisting
of three members, beappointod to join such com-
mittee as may be appointed by the House of Rep-
resentatives, to wait upon the President of the
United States,to inform linn that a quorum of each
House is assembled, and that Congress is ready
to receive any communication he may be pleased
to make.
Mr. MOORHEAD offered the following reso-
lution; which was read,considered,and agreed to:
Resolved, That a committee be appointed upon th j part
of thb House, to jom such committee as may be appointed
upon the part of the Sonate, to wait upon the President
of the United States, to inform him that a quorum of the
two Houses is assembled, and that Congress i* prepaied to
leceive any communication he may be pleased to make.
The SPEAKER subsequently appointed Mr.
Moorhead, Mr. Bocock, and Mr. Adams of
Kentucky, as such committee.
HOUR OF MEETING.
Mr. FLORENCE. I move that twelve o 'clock
be the daily hour of meeting until further ordered.
The motion was agreed to.
HOMESTEAD BILL.
Mr. CROW. I rise to a privileged question.
I call up the motion to reconsider the vote by
which the bill reported by me from the Commit-
tee on Agriculture to secure homesteads to actual
settlers was referred to the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union; and upon the
motion to reconsider I call the previous question.
The bill was read by its title, as follows:
A bill (H. R. No. 524) to secure homesteads tc
actual settlers on the public domain.
Mr. PHELPS. If we are to have no discus-
sion upon that bill, I move to lay it upon the table.
This is calling up the question too soon.
Mr. GROW. I propose to leave it open to dis-
cussion.
Mr. PHELPS. The gentleman can call up his
motion on any other day than the present; but
now there are members absent from the House,
and we have not time to examine the bill.
Again, I suppose the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania contemplates that we shall have the usual
lottery to secure our seats for the session; and for
that further reason I suggest to the gentleman the
postponement of his motion, and the calling it up
another day. If the gentleman persist in his mo-
tion, I shall insist upon my motion to lay the bill
upon the table.
Mr. GROW. I withdraw the call for the pre-
vious question one moment, to say that my object
was not to put the bill upon its passage now, but
to leave it open to discussion, if any gentleman
desires to discuss it. I call up the motion to re-
consider now, in order that we may have the busi-
ness before the House. Gentlemen are aware that
there are special orders covering almost entirely
the first three or four weeks of the session, and
