repulsed in his first attempt Hooker tried to turn the position, but in this blundered yet worse, for he sent his troops through the nearest gap in White Oak Ridge, not more than half a mile distant from the gorge, where the movement was fully visible to the enemy, and where they had time to prepare a destructive cross-fire, which made this attack quite as fatal as the former. Having thus failed in this flank movement, in which the Twelfth Missouri lost nearly all its officers, he sent Geary's troops again at the front, and finally carried it by Geary's New York regiments. The troops of Osterhaus suffered most. It is said that a rebel regiment laid down its arms, and when the Twelfth Missouri came near in consequence, another rebel regiment rose from the ground immediately in the rear and gave our men a fatal volley. The truth of this story I have not been able to ascertain for myself, but it is generally believed by our officers. Colonel Longs' cavalry expedition has arrived at Harrison, having destroyed the railroad at Cleveland for 3 miles on both the Dalton and Chattanooga lines. Longstreet is reported as having been at Calhoun on the 25th instant with his command. Bragg staid here night before last in same house where Grant is lodged. Our advance has been nearly to Tunnel Hill, and reports strong rebel force concentrated there; another heavy body is at La Fayette. Howard's corps went to Varnell's Station yesterday to destroy railroad, and move down toward Cleveland, tearing up the track. Sherman is at Graysville, and all this army perfectly concentrated. Granger ordered to move from Chattanooga toward the Hiwassee last night or at daylight this morning. Considerable rain last night. Muddy.

Arriving here I find the results of Colonel Long's cavalry expedition were much more important than was reported at Ringgold. He burned 80 wagons, including Bragg's headquarters train, of which he brought in the mules; tore up the railroad between Cleveland and Charleston and for 10 miles south of Cleveland, and captured 250 prisoners; would have burned Hiwassee Bridge but for cannon rebels had there. Sherman marches at daylight from Graysville for Charleston. Granger marched hence same direction this afternoon. No news respecting Longstreet. Rain.

The active campaign here must terminate with the pending operations against Longstreet, which can scarcely be prolonged beyond December 6. The condition of the roads, and the impossibility of getting supplies even as far as Chattanooga, if forage for mules and
