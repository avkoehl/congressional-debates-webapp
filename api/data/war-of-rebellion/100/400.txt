The department further informs me that -

The reel leader, Jeff. Davis, with his cabinet, passed into South Carolina, with the intention no doubt of getting out of the country, either via Cuba or across the Mississippi. All the vigilance and available means at your command should be brought to bear to prevent the escape of those leaders of the rebellion.

The commanders of vessels stationed along the coast will use every measn in their power to communicate to the iron-clads at Port Royal and Charleston the earliest intelligence of any vessel approaching the coast resembling the Stonewall, and to prevent the escape of the rebel leader and his accomplices. It is difficult to fix upon any precise point where this vessel might be expected; but once seen every effort should be made to spread the information among the squadron, and to bring the monitors within range of her, particularly to keep sight of her, so as to retain a knowledge of hear locality. The Canonicus and Nantucket are at Port Royal, the Passaic and Catskill at Charleston.
