Brigadier-General HINKS:

The major-general commanding directs that you move your command by the right flank until you connect with General Brooks at once. When the order for assault is given you will have a heavy line of skirmishers on your front, which you will please extend some distance beyond your left flank to protect it from enfilade fire. You will make at the same time every disposition to assault, and when you are ready send word to these headquarters and await further orders. Should General Kautz by any chance get into the town, you will take every precaution not to fire into him as he sweeps down the enemy's lines.

Respectfully, &c.,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
