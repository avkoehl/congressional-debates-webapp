Just received from Okolona:

We are now (1 o'clock) 15 miles from Sparta, on the Houston and WEST Point road. I will go to Sparta to-night, where I learn the enemy are. Cannonading heard in that direction about 12 o'clock.

COLUMBUS, April 22, 1863.

The enemy is reported 2 1/2 miles northwest of Palo Alto with his main body. Colonel [C. R.] Barteau had skirmish with him yesterday evening near Calvert's plantation, and fell back to the junction of the Houston and Greenville roads, where he now is. Can you send troops from Grenada to effect a diversion?

COLUMBUS, April 25, 1863.

Colonel [C. R.] Barteau reports the enemy completely routed at Birmingham yesterday evening. The destruction of a bridge prevented pursuit.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON.

COLUMBUS, April 26, 1863.

Captain [F.] Ingate reports reliable information has just been received that the enemy were passing Houston this morning, going toward Pontotoc. I suppose that this may be the force reported at Bankston's Mills. The reported advance on Aberdeen was unfounded.

Brigadier-General.
