NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864-10 a.m.

Colonel C. R. THOMPSON, Johnsonville:

Your dispatches are received. The Forty-third Wisconsin will be used as guards to the trains of quartermaster's stores coming to this place. Will all the stores be shipped to-day? If not, how many cars do you require, and how long will it take to get them on trains for this place? If everything has been sent away from Johnsonville you may withdraw from the place with your force, marching in the direction of Nashville along the railroad, picking up your guards as you come along. Answer immediately, with full report.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

JOHNSONVILLE, November 29, 1864-10.30 a.m.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

Your dispatch just received. All the valuable stores have been sent except the machinery, which is being loaded and will be ready to be sent out by 2 o'clock this p.m. There will be about twenty car-loads of stores left. The goods will consist of carpenters' tools and mess furniture, such as stoves, ranges, &amp;c. Will cars be sent for them, and when may they be expected? We have switch engines here to send train with machinery out with.

C. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Colonel C. R. THOMPSON, Johnsonville:

I directed last night that sufficient cars should be sent to Johnsonville to bring away everything to-day, so that you could move with your troops and the wagon train to this place. Have you sent away all the cannon? If not, and no train arrives to-day, you must destroy the carriages of the 20-pounders and throw the guns in the river. The battery will come along with you.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864-12 m.

Colonel C. R. THOMPSON, Johnsonville:

Your dispatch of 10.30 this a.m. is just received. Forty cars [four trains] have been ordered to Johnsonville, and will leave here at once for the balance of the stores now remaining at Johnsonville. Immediately upon arrival of the trams I wish you to have them loaded and sent forward to Nashville, after which you will withdraw your command from Johnsonville, leaving store-houses and other property undisturbed, and march along the line of the railroad to this place, taking up the guards along the road as you move this way. Should you learn beyond the possibility of a doubt that a heavy force of the enemy has crossed Duck River, and there is a possibility of your being cut off from this place, then move promptly upon Clarksville and take post at that place. Acknowledge receipt.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
