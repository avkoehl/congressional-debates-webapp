1839.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
g§^E
A more perfectly party Speaker, one who would
be more disposed to bend the rules of the House
to meet the pin poses of his own side in politics,
never had piessed the soft and ample cushions of
that goigeous chair    To say that he had been
impartial in the duties of his high office would be
but flattery, it would be certifying to what was
not true, and Mr P had too often seen the ef
fects of ceitificates not to be cautious how he
gave them    He was willing to make the Speaker
a courteoas parting bow, but he would not con-
sent to let him sit there and do all his party woik
and then march out with the honors of war   The
duties of the Chau were too impoitant foi this
The piestding officer of that House out out, in !
effect, all the business of the House     It was he '
who placed before it all the material work for
its action, and decided who should work it up   i
Through the standing committees of that House,
his powet extended to the utmost bounds of the i
nation     It was, in some respects, b< yond thatot

te Deum lauiamus as high as they pic ased, but he |
called upon all those whose fite sentiments had
been crushed on that flooi by the weight of his   |
official tiuncheon, to \*l the woild see that they
would not give thu. lie to those s ntunents of in   I

Mr P concluded by moving as Ins amendment
to the resolution, to stnke out the wold " lmpai-
tiallv "
Mi   GRAY said he did not use foi the pui
pose of discussing the lesolution, but  foi  tl e
purpose, if the House should agiee with him, of
having mimed ate action upon it, that the House
might proceed as speedily a  possible to othei
business      He said it was his intention to move
the  previous  question, but before he made tint   1
motion he would make a bnef icply to the s^-   ¡
tleman fiom Mississippi,  [Vfi   Prfn^iss,] who   ,
had not objected to the ¡esolution on the giound J
that the Speakei had not with ability and impu- '!
tiahty  piesidod   over   the  dehbeiations  of   the   I
House, but, on the contiary, tne gentleman con
ceded 'hat the Speaker had, with ability and im-
partiality, decided all questions which,  by  the
i ules and parliament iry law of the House, it had
been his duty to decide     The whole giound of
objection was, that the Speaker* had appointed a
majority of his political friends on the 1 ading
and most important committees of the House,
and hence the Speaker had not  been impartial
The gentleman said, stnke out the word " im-
partial," and he would vote for the resolution
Was it not the duty of the Speaker to appoint
committees as the House wouid have done ' Can
any one doubt that the House would, by ballot,
have elected committees precisely, ot at least sub-
stu tia'ly, as the Speakei appointed them >
Could an instance be given in which a commit-
tee had been elected, that the majority of the I
House had not placed a distinct majority of their
political friends upon the committee' There is a
case too lecent to be forgotten by the House—the
Swaitwout committee A majority of the House
aie opposed to the Independent Treasury, and
supposed, perhaps, that if they could have a |
committee of opponents of that measure, argu-
ments might be found against the measure, and
what was the iesult> The committee was six and
thiee—two to one against the Administration
The lesolution offeied is not novel, ithasbeen
customaiy heie, and is customary in all the State
Legislatures    One was passed complimentary to
\ii   Stevenson at the expiration of hi  term of
service      He  puisued the same course as the
piesent Speakei in the appointment of commit-
tees, and, moie íecently, at the expiration of the
term  of the gentleman from Tennessee, [Mi
Bfil,] a lesolution m nearly if not the precise
language with the one undei consideration, was
passed     1 he gentleman fiom  Iennessee, [Mi
Bthi,] who was then in favor of the -Vdmims
n iti  ii, followed the txaiijlc of Mi   Stevenson
in the appointment of committees
Mi G said he had before him t'n Tournals,
and w old lead the ippointmc it of commit! rs
mad 1 v the g nt'i nan fiom Tennessee, [Mr i
Blll,] if any o le desned it The present Spp ikti
his done the sime, nothing more, and less he
could not do, unless he entnely disregaided the
wil' of the mijo ity
Mi G sud his colleague [Mi Curtis] had
ía sed a question of oidei upon the intioduction
of the ii solution, and as Ik supposed his objtct
was to defeat the ii solution by pr< venting its con
sid i ition, Mi G s-mJ he would lefei to m et-
impli ii the New Ye k Legislature, \vbii h his
colic igut wiuld i collect In 1838, the present
Li ntuiintGivdiior of that State was Sp ikei
of the \s-i mbly Dun i rthesession puty spnit
i mi high, fiequf nt collisions took place between
the ninouty of the House and the Speiker,
many appeals weie tiken fiom the Speakei s de-
cision,-ud much aspenty vas exhibited in de-
bate, and yet, at the close ol the session, tne
minoiity joined in an expiession of thanks to the
Sneakbi A distinguished individual of that mi
noiity, formeily a mi mbei of this Xlouse, [Mi
Mann,] as is usual on such occasions., rose aoove
thepaity excitement that had prevai'ed, and made
a speech highly comphmentaiy to the Speaker,
it wis due to the Speakei and the honoi rf the
btate, that the minonty should thus act and
should the same just spnit pievail heie, what is
due to he dignity of the Hiuse, to the Speakei,
md to the honoi of the nation v ould be done
But mothei and moie significant objection is
i ustd i is, that the adoption of th s lesolution
may mpk him pohtiei! capitil that it may be
used m tne Tennessee election " upon eve i y stump
m the S a         hence the gentleman fiom Missis
sippi \ ould withhold fiom 1 nn the justice which,
by paihunf ltar-y cusiom, is due to him, le-t by
do ng justice to him now, he niw have justice
done him hereiftei in his own State Mi G said
it was not a m ittei tl at ought to be discussed,
the facts in the case were upon íecoid, and known
to the Hotre, the piopnety of the lesolution was
self evident and if gentle men wished to make a
paity question of i , a id show the countiy that
they earned jiarty feelings toan t noiecedented
and unvvau antable extent thesoonei tl ej declare
it the bettei
Mr  G   then moved the previous question
The pievious quest i o i having bppn movpd upon
the resolution, it was seconded, and upon the
motion shall the main question be put, which was
upon the adoption of the lesilution, it was decided
in the affiimative by the fallowing vote

A motion was made by "VIi CONNOR that the

as fohows
Gentlemen of th' House of Representatives In
taki ig leave of this body, m all probability for-
evei, emotions aie excited which no language
can adequately convey When I look back to
the penod when I fust took my seat m this
Houoe, and then look aiound me foi those who
weie at that time my associates here, I find but
faw, very few, lemaimng But five members
who weie here with me fonrtepn ypars ago, con-
tinue to be membeis of this body My seivice
heie has been cons'ant and laborious I can,
peihaps, say what but tew othns, if any, can—
that I have not failed lo attend the daily sittings
of this House a single d ly since I have been a
member of it, save on a single occasion, when
pieventcd foi a shoit time by indisposition In
my intercourse with the membeis of this body,
when I oceupi d a pi tec upon the llooi, though
occasionally eng iged m debates upon interesting
public qu stions, and of an exciting charactei,
it is a souicc of unimngled giatification to me
to ¡ecui to the fact that on no occasion was
there the slightest peisonal oi unpleasant colli-
sion with any of i s membeis Maintaining,
and at all times expiessmg, my own opinions
fiimly, tne same light was fully conceded to
otiléis üui discussions were at that time con-
ducted with that couitesy and decomm, and re-
spect foi the opinion of others, which ought ever
to pievail in a deliberative assembly Poi foui
years past the station I have occumed, and a
sense of piopnety, in the divided and unusually
excited st^te of public opinion and feeling which
has existed both in this House and in the coun-
try, have precluded me fiom paiticipatmgin your
debates     Othei duties weie assigned me
The high office of Speaker, to which ithasbeen
twice the pleasuic of tlu& House to el vate me,
has been at all times oni of lal or and high re-
sponsibility Its difficult, and often de'ieate, duties
have been tully appieciated and liecly exjiressed
by all my predecessors They have all borne
testimony to the difficulty , nay, impossibility , of
thscliaiging its duti s with entire satisfaction to
all, especnlly in seasons ot high political or paity
excitement Willis' they have boine this testi-
mony, I think I may tiuly affirm that none of
them liavb had aseverei oideal to pass than has
fallen to my lot Frequent have been the occa-
sions when, but for the indulgent and hbeial sup-
