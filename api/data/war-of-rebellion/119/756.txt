HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,December 25, 1863.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Commissioner of Exchange, Richmond:

The agents of the Sanitary Commission claim that a Mr. Alfred F. Brengle, now confined at Castle Thunder, near Richmond, was employed in the Sanitary Commission at the time of his arrest; was entirely noncombatant, and ought therefore to be exchanged. I am informed that it has been proposed to exchange him for a Mr. Thatcher, also a noncombatant. We have no record of such at Mr. Thatcher. We should be willing to exchange Mr. Thatcher for Mr. Brengle if he stands in similar circumstances. Will you give us means of making inquiry for Mr. Thatcher? Will you also forward Mr. Brengle, either conditionally or unconditionally? If we can find Mr. Thatcher, and he desires to be exchanged, I will send him forward.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding, and Commissioner of Exchange.

Honorable ROBERT OULD, Commissioner of Exchange, Richmond:

I understand that it has been proposed by you that if the officers and crews of the steamers Emily and Arrow, captured by your forces about the 16th of May, 1863, and the boats were in the service of the United States in the Quartermaster's Department when captured, and officers and men would be released. I am not informed how the proposed evidence can bear upon the matter; I therefore take the liberty of sending to you to ask if such a proposition has been made before I look for the evidence suggested, if any such exists.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding, and Commissioner of Exchange.
