Colonel RICHMOND:

I have just arrived from Buffington Bar. Eighth and Ninth Michigan Cavalry are coming through the country, with instruction to hunt up all rebel bands. My instructions to Generals Shackelford, Wolford, and Kautz were to pursue ill directions that enemy could take. They were yesterday pursuing in direction of Eight-Mile Island, and I heard they had captured, 1,000 prisoners. Shall I send the prisoners, guns, nd captured horses to Cincinnati?

General E. H. HOBSON, Pomeroy:

Morgan, whit remnant of his force, is reported some 15 miles north of Athens, moving toward Marietta. Communicate with M. M. Greene, of Athens, if you have telegraph connections, and make your dispositions accordingly. He will probably try to get to the river, north of you. Spare no pains to prevent this and to finish him.

General BURNSIDE:

Of the forces I brought up with me, the Fourteenth Illinois is out after the remnant of Morgan's force. General Shackelford's forces were at Cheshire. He sent out 1,000 men yesterday. General Hobson's force has just arrived from Buffington. The Starlight and Ingomar left here last night at 7 p. m., with 663 enlisted men and 48 officers, prisoners. Information I deem reliable has just reached me of Morgan's force 10 miles west of Athens, making for the Ohio, via Hocking River. He may attempt to cross at Buffington or Belleville. I have ordered the Fifth Indiana Cavalry and Twelfth Kentucky Cavalry to strike out at once to mouth of Hocking River, leaving detachment sin road leading to the Ohio. There is heavy militia force qt Blennerhassett's. I do of my orders? Hobson in command of cavalry of my division. Neither Shackelford nor Wolford need any superintendence as far as operations are concerned.
