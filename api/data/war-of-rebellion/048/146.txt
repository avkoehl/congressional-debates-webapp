escape and came in this morning. One of them reports that while lying in the woods he heard last night mounted men and wagons crossing a small stream near him. Three wagons were this morning distinctly seen with a glass coming down the side of the mountain to the left of Thoroughfare Gap. Major Scott, with 220 infantry and 30 mounted men, has gone in that direction, and Brigadier-General King has telegraphed that he would send 140 cavalry to co-operate with him. From the statement of the men, I should infer that there was quite a large force on this side of Bull Run Mountains.
