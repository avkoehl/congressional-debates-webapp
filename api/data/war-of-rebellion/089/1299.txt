I am apprehensive that enemy will attempt to cross the bar in boats and carry the position at night by landing on Fort Fisher beach inside. I think they are only waiting for smooth water. This plan, if they have hit upon it, tallies with report of their large number of boats drilling in launches and troops on large frigates. It is most dangerous to us. I shall order some of Connally's force into Fisher to-night. Let Reilly's men take several days' rations with them. If Hoke's people arrive all will be well. Cushing, as well as Butler, in this expedition. Savannah evacuated two day s ago. Report to lamb.

WILMINGTON, December 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General HEBERT,

Smithville:

The general directs that you send, if transportation can be had, two companies from Caswell or Bald Head, as most convenient, to Confederate Point on picket duty, with one day's rations. The Pelteway and Cape Fear went to Fisher this morning, and Either that is there is ordered to go over for them.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WILMINGTON, December 23, 1864.

Colonel LAMB,

Fort Fisher:

Can you put a picket or lookout on the Condor, or can you have a boat-moving picket in case of attempt to run in? Am more afraid of that way of attack than any other. You should have your light battery placed before night for sweeping the beach from inside the breaker toward the Mound. I send re-enforcements to-day, and will get more to-morrow if you are all right to-night. Keep a good lookout. Depend upon it the enemy will not try to pass their fleet except the troops are in front and lead the way in the dark, when it would be easy.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
