there was no fighting, except an occasional skirmish between the pickets. The day was occupied in collecting and bringing in from the field as many of the wounded from the preceding day's battle as could be gotten at. The number brought in was as follows:

One hundred empty army wagons, obtained from the reserve supply train on the morning of the 4th, were divided equally among the several corps, and the corps medical directors were ordered to send all wounded to White House, using one-half of their ambulances if necessary. Forty-three new ambulances, which reported on the morning of the 4th, were sent to the medical director of the Eighteenth Corps to assist in the same work. Each medical director also had all of the corps' empty wagons. All the trains were loaded and on the way by 2 p. m., the number being sent was as follows:

Corps.	 Sick.	 Wounded.	 Wagons.	 Ambulances

Second	 17	 606	 29	 84

Fifth	 43	 420	 66	 40

Ninth	 87	 639	 60	 64

Sixth	 14	 729	 75	 58

Eighteenth	 ---	 400	 25	 43

Total	 161	 2,794	 255	 289
