GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

Numbers 68. July 4, 1863-4. 15 p. m.

The commanding general, in behalf of the country, thanks the Army of the Potomac for the glorious result of the recent operations.

An enemy, superior in numbers, and flushed with the pride of a successful invasion, attempted to overcome and destroy this army. Utterly baffled and defeated, he has now withdrawn from the contest. The privations and fatigue the army has endured, and the heroic courage and gallantry it has displayed, will be matters of history, to be over remembered.

Our task is not yet accomplished, and the commanding general looks to the army for greater efforts to drive from our soil every vestige of the presence of the invader. *

It is right and proper that we should, on all suitable occasions, return our grateful thanks to the Almighty Disposer of events, that in the goodness of this providence He has thought fit to give victory to the cause of the just.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 4, 1863.

Corps commanders will detail burial parties to bury all the enemy's dead in the vicinity of their lines. Correct accounts of the numbers
