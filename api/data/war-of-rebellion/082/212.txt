HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

July 13, 1864-3.45 p.m.

Brigadier-General BENHAM,Commanding Engineer Brigade, City Point;

Colonel Spaulding reports that a large portion of the sand-bags brought up this morning are rotten and otherwise damaged, and probably more than a third are utterly worthless. Will you have what are on hand examined, if practicable, and if the number originally ordered is materially diminished by mildew, or in any other way, will you see to having others procured?

A. A. HUMPHREYS.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CITY POINT, July 13, 1864,

(Received 5.40 p.m.)

General A. A. HUMPHREYS.

Chief of Staff:

I have previously directed that no rotten bags should be sent up. I fear that the defective bags are a portion of 30,000 drawn from the engineer department in April when your order was received. The balance of the 100,000 mostly purchased new at that time, I trust are sound, and strong as they were then. Orders will at once go to Washington for 30,000 new ones to supply defects.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.

COMPANY C, FIFTEENTH NEW YORK VOL. ENGINEERS,

Camp on Jones' Neck, James River, Va., [July 13, 1864.]

Captain CHANNING CLAPP.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Engineer Brigade:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that since my last I report nothing of unusual interest has occurred. I am now making some necessary repairs on the boats; some of them require new timber-heads, but these cannot be repaired here for the want of proper material and tools. The health of this command continues very good.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TIMOTHY LUBEY,

Captain, Fifteenth New York Vol. Engineers, Commanding Company C.
