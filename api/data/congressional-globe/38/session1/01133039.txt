would pay 40 per cent. What is the reason for
the reduction? May not this reduction be made
a cover for ihe introduction of the materials out
of which these things are made at a cheaper rate
than they otherwise would be? I have my doubts
aH to whether this clause should be adopted.
Mr. FESSENDEN. These are small articles,
which come in competition with nothing at all,
and we want to get some duty on them. They
are brought in here in order to let them stand as
they did before. They are made for this special
purpose.
Mr. SUMNEIt. The Senator will understand
me: the point is, that this clause may be used as
a cover for the introduction of these materials.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Not at all. It cannot
cover anything of the sort. They are cut into
patterns, made in a particular way.
Mr. SUMNER. I am told by those familiar
with the subject they may be.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Not at all.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section five, line
one hundred and ten, after the words " oil-cloth"
to insert the words "except silk oil-cloths;" so
that it will read:
On oil-cloths for floors, stamped, painted, or printed,
valued at GO cents or less per square yard, 30 percent, ad ra-
tal em; valued at over 5'J cents per square yard, and on all
other oil-elotn, except silk oil-eiotll, 40 per cent, ad valorem.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think the duty ou^ht
to be slightly increased on cordage. I therefore
move, in section seven, line twenty-three, to strike
out "2^" and to insert " 3;" and in line twenty-
five to strike out " j" and insert " so that it
will read: " On tarred cables orcordage, 3 cents ;
per pound; on untairedManillacordage, 2j cents
p^r pound."
The amendment wag agreed to.
Mr. FESSENDEN. We desire and think it
necessary to finish this bill to-night, and I rise
for the purpose of suggesting that fact to the
Senate, and'taking the sense of the Senate upon
whether we will take a recess until some hour
this evennie, or go on with the bill now until we
get through with it.
Mr. JOHNSON and Mr. SUMNER. Letus !
go on. I
Mr. FESSENDEN. I am perfectly content if
it is understood that we are to^ go on and finish
the bill to-night.
Several StivATOiis. Oh, no; let us take a re-
cess.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think that seems to be
the voice of the town meeting, and therefore I
will make a motion that at twenty-five minutes
before five o'clock we take a recess until seven
o'clock.
Mr. JOHNSON. Why not take it now ?
Mr. FESSENDEN. That is precisely the time
no w.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Pome-
RO-f.) The Chair understands the motion to be
that the Senate take a recess from five minutes
before five o'clock till seven o'clock.
Mr. FESSENDEN. No, sir; that was not the
motion. I said twenty-five minutes to five. How-
ever, I will chnn^o my motion, and move that the
Senate now take a recess until seven o'clock.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate ac-
cordingly took a recess until seven o'clock.

the "Whole. It instructs the Postmaster General

Sault Ste. Marie, Marquette, Copper Harbor,
Eagle Harbor, Eagle River, and Ontonagon, Mich-
igan; LaPointe and Superior, Wisconsin; during
the years from 1854 to 1859, inclusive, and allow
therefor such amount as to him shall appear just
and equitable,not exceeding the amount allowed
for the same service to the party who afterwards
performed the same under contract.
