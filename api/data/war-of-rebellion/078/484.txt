CHATTANOOGA, September 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

I have received your telegram directing the placing of troops on Nashville and Chattanooga road as far as their numbers will enable me to guard the road. In reply, previous to my arrival, 2,500 men were sent from Chattanooga to report to General Granger. I now understand they were diverted from Stevenson to Nashville. I have sent four additional regiments to the tunnel. As to Elk and Duck Rivers, I do not see where I am to get the troops, unless I am authorized to draw from General Smith and Cartersville. The troops I now have at Bridgeport and Whiteside's are barely sufficient for their defense.

JNO NEWTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, September 26, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Dispatches of Generals Sherman and Thomas received. General Steedman is not here, being absent on leave, as previously reported. I am relieving the garrisons at Chattanooga and Bridgeport, and ordering all available troops to report to General Milroy, as he requested by telegraph, and at the places designated by him. General Milroy expects my whole DIVISION to go to him, which is impossible, unless I leave the lines from Bridgeport to Chattanooga without defenses. When I arrived here I found myself the senior of officer in this district, and so far as immediate movements are concerned I have taken the authority for doing them. General Steedman's assistant adjutant-general is here.

JNO NEWTON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General NEWTON, Chattanooga:

General Rousseau left last evening for Pulaski to find the enemy. At 10. 30 a. m. to-day he was twenty-three miles from there. His advance may have met them by this time. The enemy have taken Athens and destroyed Elk River bridge, which is an important one, and will close the Alabama road for some time. It seems to me we should now make the safety of the Chattanooga road our one care. I ordered back a force sent to re-enforce General Granger. If from anything you learn you deem it better to have them with you, do so. It seems to me that a considerable force had better come here to be in readiness to move when wanted. The Northwestern railroad, with large quantities of supplies at Johnsonville, is very much exposed.

NASHVILLE, TENN., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General NEWTON, Chattanooga:

Dispatch just received from General Rousseau, at Pulaski. Forrest is seven miles south of that place; has sent forward two brigades of cavalry to feel them. Think it likely that Forrest will cross over to
