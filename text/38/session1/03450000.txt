Mr. SUMNER. Mr. President, I present a
petition fi Mil a large number of Germans in Bos-
ton rczaiding the proclamation of amnesty and
the plan of reconstruction contained m the last
presidential message. They state several objec-
tions to that plan of reconstruction; bit tall of them
more or less seem to center in one to this effect:
18
" that it enables the enemies of the Republic di-
rectly to revive slavery, which is the cause of the
war;" and they conclude by calling upon Con-
gress " to take hold of reconstruction, and in such
a way as to secure the abolition of slavery for-
ever, the avoidance of a landed aristocracy by in-
cluding the confiscated lands under the homestead
bill, by free education forthe negroes and the un-
educated white people, and also by other arrange-
ments which will make the rebels politically
harmless." As this subject has already, on the
motion oftheScnatorfrom New Jersey, [Mr.Tf.n
Eyck,] been referred to the Committee on the Ju-
diciary, I move the reference of this petition to
that committee.
The motion was agreed to.

Bailey, praying for a modification of the exist-

mittee on Patents and the Patent Office.

seph Ford, of Northfield, Rice county, Minne-
sota, praying for the passage of an act allowing
him to enter certain lands in Rice county, Min-
nesota, under the act of Congress entitled " An

dred and sixty citizcns of the towns of Harmony
and Milton, Rock county, m the State of Wis-
consin, tendering their thanks to Congress and
to the President for the various measures taken
to suppress the rebellion, and praying that still,
more efficient measures may be taken to thatsame
end, and especially that colored soldiers may be
put upon the same footing as to pay and privi-
leges with white soldiers, and that measures may
be taken to make emancipation general; which
was tefeited to the select committee on fieedmen

Mr. DOOLITTLE presented a memorial of the

that such action may be taken as shall result in

the objections and inequalities existing in the pres-
ent tieaty; which was referred to the Committee
on Foreign Relations; and a motion of Mr.Doo-
littlk that the memorial be printed, was referred

THE CONFIRMATION OF GENERAL SCHOFIELD.
Mr. BROWN. Mr. President, I ask leave to
submit to the Senate a memorial received from a
large majority of the loyal members of the Mis-
souri General Assembly, piotestmg against the
confirmation by this body of the nomination of
Brigadier General J. M. Schofield to the position
of major general in the volunteer foices. It is 111
these words:
Protest fiom David Wucnei and smv-three other members
of the Le£i-!aru!<' ot Mis-ouu. against the nomination ot
John M- yc!ioii''ld to be a major geneiai m the volunteer
lorces of the United States,
JprrFRSox City, Missouri, December, 1863.
To ike Honorable Senate oj the United States:
The undersigned, member ol the Geneial Assembly of
the State of Mit^oun, do earnestly protect with your imn-
oiab'.e bodv at,aiu-t th * continuation ot Biigadui Gt tici.ti
J. M. Sehofichi :>< maioi general, to, the reason that, during
his command ni tin-" depattm/'"it. lu^ influence and nation-
al HaV'j been partial, and lavorabic atom.- to the com-
nton'v -<i bel ? j and ha- been
u-*ed "nL'aii'-f th" t. uly Io\ ai eiuzeti^ win have been ia\al
without a -ingle unit or fnio.ii h ot ^wnparliy lot pso-.la-
veiy treason ot iiaiioii. He h,. J;ivirovei, associated lura-
i! fadf with, and peimitu d his official influence and patronage
to support that clique who are attempting to crush out the
ftipud4: of the Union and liberty, and also to deprtve the
gallant Mi^omi soldier* in the Federal Army /turn their
right!ul expression as citizens in the exercise of the elective
franchise—an outrage of the blackeit characler,andsttchdep~
rivation attempted solely to fasten on an unurillin  people
a curse sought to he gotten rid of. °
Can we, need we, ofier stronger reasons to your honor-
able body to induce you to reject such confirmation ?
Wc believe there yet remain a sufficient number of gal-
lant arid meritorious! officers, deserving ofpiomotion, with-
out eonleriinjf honors on officers whose influence^ when in
]> otr< r,has in.cn given in favoring " rebel sympathizers" and
Iho'-c hostile to the Federal Government.
IVe <Aaim to represent the undoubted loyal men of Mis-
souri, and a party true to the piinciples and flag of the Union
and hcedoni—a party sustained at the last State clecuo'n fry
amajority of the Loyal mcnoftkis State a.nd nineteen twkn-
tiltiis of the soldiers in the field. We have, moreover,
almost without any favor or patronage from the General
Government, and with the opposition of a corrupt State
Government—corrupted by pro-slavery secession influences—
fought this political contest, ever keeping the flag of free-
dom victorious.
We ask you to favorably consider our petition and pro-
test.
