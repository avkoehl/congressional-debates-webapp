capacity of lending to the Government, in lact
paid m its notes which rested on the faith of
the Government stock, on whicn it was drawing
eight per cert, to that, in truth, it but loaned to the
Government it  own credit
Such were the extraordinary ad/antages con-
ferred on this institution, and of which it h?d an
exclusive monopoly, and these are the causes
which gave such an extraordinary impulse to its
giowth and influence, that it increased in a little
more ihan a hundred jears, fiom 1694 to 1797,
(when the second era of the system, commenced
"With the establishment of the Bank of Englan ),
-rmmated,) from 1,200,000 to nearly £i 1,000,000,
''ad this mainly by the addition to its capital by
«ans to the Government above the profit  of its
anual dividends Before entering on the third e-"a
of the system, I pause to make a few reflections
on the second
I am struck, m casting my eyes over it, to find
that, notwithstanding the great dissimilarity of
features which the system had assumed in passing
from a mere bank of deposite to that of deposite,
discount, and circulation, the opeiation of the
latter was confojnded throughout this long period,
as it regard"! the effects on the currency, with the
bank of deposite Its notes were um\ er-ally
regarded as representing gold and silver, and as
depending on that representation exclusively for
their cuculation, as much so as did the certificates
of deposite in the orgmal Bank of Amsteidam
No one supposed that they could retain their credit
for a moment after they ceased to be convertible
into the metals on demand, nor weie they sup-
posed to have the effect of mcreas n  the aggregate
amount of the currency, nor, of con-se, of increas-
ing prices In a woi Í, the) were in the public
mind as completely ieleiUfied with the metallic
cuirency as if every note m circulation had laid
up m the -vaults of the bank an equal amount,
pound for pound, into which all its paper could be
converted the moment it w as presented
All this was a great delusion The issues of the
bank never dtdiepresent, from the first, the precious
metals Instead of the representatives, its notes
were in leality the substitute for com Instead of
being the mere drudges, performing all the out-door
service, while the coins íeposed at their ease in the
vaults of the baaks, fiee from wear and teat, ard
the hazard of loss or destruction, as weie the ci.rt -
ficates of deposites m the oiigmal Bank of Amstei-
dam, they substituted, degraded, and bin hed
the coins Every note circulated became the sub-
stitute of so much com, and dispensed with it in
circulation, and therebv depreciated the value oí
the precious metals, and increased their consump
tion in the ■¡ame prepoilion, while if diminished,
in the same degree, the supply, by rendering money
less productive The system assumed gold and
silver as the basis of its circulation, and vet, by
the laws of its nature, just as it increased its cir
culation, m the same degree the foundation on
which the system s<ood was weakened The con-
sumption of the metals increased, and the supply
diminished As the weight of the superstiueture
increased, just m the same proportion its founda-
tion was undermined and weakened Thus, the
germ of destruction w as implanted m the system at
its birth, ha« expanded with its growth, and must ter-
minate, one da> or other, in its drsso'ution, unless,
indeed, it should, by some transition, entirely
change its natuie, and piss into some oihei an 1
entirely different organic form The conflict be-
tween bank cuculation and metallic (.though not
perceived in the first stage of tkp system, when
they were supposed to be mdt^solubly connected)
is mortal, oie oi the other mu«t perish in the strug-
gle     Sueh is t1 e deciee of fate   it is irreveisible
Near the close of tne second era the sjstem pas-
sed the Atlantic, at d took root in oui country,
where it lound the soi still moie fertile, and the
climate more congenial than even in the parent
country The bank of INorlh Amer ca uas csti-
blishedin 1781, with a capital ot °>400 000 and
beanng all the features of its ptototype, the Dank
of England In the short spice d ,tl tile more
than half a century,the sjstem n is expanded fiom
one bank to about eight hunelred, ¿eluding blanch-
es, {no one knows the exact amount, so lapiel the
increase) and from a capital of less than a half
million, to about $300 000,000, without apparently
exhausting or diminishing its eapacity to increase
So accelerated has been its growth with us, fiom
causes tv Inch I explained on a former occasion,*
that already it has attained a point much
nearer the assigned limits ot the system in its
present form, than what it has m England
During the year 1797, the Bank of England sus-
pended specie payment, an ev ent destined by its
consequ nces to effect a resolution m public opin-
ion in re'a ion to the sjstem, and to accelerate the
period which must cletermme its fate England
was then engaged m that gigantic struggle n hich
ong nated in the French revolutio i, and her finan-
cial operations were on the mo=t e\ten led scale,
followed by a corresponding increase m the ar tion
of the bank, as her fiscal agent It sunk under its
over-action Specie payments were suspended
Panic and dismay spread thiough the land—so deep
and durable was the impression, that the credit of
the bank depended exclusively on the punctuality
of its payments In the midst of the alarm, an
act of Parliament was passed making the notes of
the bank a legil tender, and to the surprise of all,
the institution proceeded on, apparently w ithout any
diminution of its credit Its notes circulated
freely -s evei, and without anv depreciation, for a
time, compared with gold and silvei, and continued
so to do for upwards of twenty years with an ?ve-
rage diminution of about one per cent per annum
This shock did much to dispel the delusion that
bank notes represented gold and silver, and that
they circulated, in consequence of such representa-
tion, but without entnely obliterating on that point
the old impression, which had taken such st-ong
hold on the public mind The credit of its notes
dti ing the suspension, was gcnerall} attributed to
the tender act, and the gieat and united resources oí
the bank and the government
But an event followed st the same kind, under
encumstances entirely diffeient, which did more
than any preceding, to shed light on the true natuie
of the svstem, ana to unfold its vnst capacity to
sustain itself without exte-ior aid We finally be-
came involved in the mighty stiugg'e that had so
long desolated Europe, and enriched our country
War was declared against Great BnUi i m 1819,
and in the shoit «pace of one }eai, our feeble
bulking svstem sunk undei the increased
iisoü action of Government I wis then a
me mber of the other House, and had taken my
full share ut responsibility m the measuies which
had ted to that result I shall never forget the sen
sation which the suspension, and the certain anti
cipation of thepiostra'im of the currency of the
country, as a consequence, excited in my mind
We could lesort to no tender act, we had no great
and central íegulating power, like th° Bank of
England, and the credit and resou-ees of the Go-
vernment were comparativelv small Ui der such
cucumstances, I looked forward to a s idden and
gieat denreciation of bank notes, and fhu they
would tail speedily as low as the old continental
monev Guess my surprise T^hen I saw them sus-
tain then ctedit, with scaicely any depieciation,
for a time, from the shock I distinct1} ^collect
when I first asked myself the question, what was the
cause'' and which directed my inquiry into the extra-
ordinary phenomenon I soon saw that the sj stem
contained w lthm itself a sclf-sustammg power, that
theie was between the banks and the community
mutually tne relation of elebtor and cied *ot, th°re
being, at all times, something more due to the
banks fiom the commumtv, than irom the latter to
the former I aw, in this reciprocal relajón of
debt and credit, 'hat the demand of the banks on
the community was j.eUei than tne amount of
the r not s in circu'at on could meet and ab^oib,
and that, consequently so ung as their deot-
ors were solvent and bound to pav at short period*,
their notes could not fail to b  at or near a par
vvi h god and "-il\ t-r I also saw that as their
debtors were principally the merchants, thev would

are the great money dealers, take the rest of the
community would also take Seeing all this, I
clearly perceived that self-sustaining principle
which poised and impelled the system self-bahnced
in the midst of the heavens, like some ce'estial
body, with scatcely a perceptible deviation irom us
path from the concussion it had íeceived
Shortly after the teimmation of the war, specie
payments were coerced with us by the establ sh-
ment of a national bank, and a few years aftei-
wards, in Great Britain, by an act of Parliament
In both countries, the restoration was followed by
wide-spread distress, as it alwa}smust when ef-
fected by coercion, for the simple reason, that
banks cannot pay unless their debtors first pay,
and that to coerce the banks, compels them to
coerce their debtors before they have the means to
pay Their failure must be the consequence, and
this involves the failure of the banks themselves,
carrj mg, in their consequences, unu ersal distress
Hence I am opposed to aU kinds of coercion, and
am in favor of leaving the disease to time, with the
action of public sentiment, and the States, to whicn
the banks are alone responsible
But to proceed with my narrative Although
specie payments were íestored, and the sjstem ap-
parently placed where it was before the suspension,
the great capacity it proved to possess of sustaining
itsell without specie payments, v as not forgot by
those who had its direction The impiession that
it was indispensable *o the circulation of its notes,
that they should represent <he precious metals, was
almost obliterated, and they were regarded lalhet as
1 estnclions on the free and profitable operation of the
system than as the means of Us secutily Hence a
feeling of opposition to gold and silver giadually
giew up on the part of the banks, which created an
esprit du coips, followed by a moial resistance to
specie payments, if I may so express myself, which
in fact suspended, m a great degree, the conversion
of their notes into the precious metals, long before
the present suspension With the giowth of this
feeling, banking business assumed a bolder charac-
ter and its profits were proportionably enlarged,
and v. ith it the tendency of the system to increase
kept pace The effect of this soon displayed itself
in a striking manner, which was followed by "very
important consequences, which I shall next explain
It so happened that the charter  of the Bank
of England and the late Bank of the United
States expired about the same time 4s the period
approached, a feeling of hostility, growing out of
the causes just explained, which had excited a
strong desire m the community, who could not par-
ticipate in the profits of these two great monopo-
lies, to throw off their re"trai it, began to disclose
itself against both institutions In Great Britain, it
terminated m breaking down the exclusive mono-
poly of the Bank of England, and narrowing
greatly the specie basis of the sjstem, by making
the notes of the Bank of England a legal tender in
all cases, except between it and us creditors A
sudden and vast increase of the system, with a gieat
diminution of the metallic basis in proportion to
banking transactions, followed, which have shocked
and vv eakened the stability of tne system there With
us, the result was difieient lhe bank fell under
the hostility Alliestramt on the s,stem was re-
moved, and banks snot up in every duection almost
instantly, under the growing impulse which I have
explained, and which, with the causes I stated
when I first addressed the Senate on this question,
is the cause of the piesent catastrophe
With it commences the fourth era of the system,
which we have just uttered—an era of snuggle,
ai d conflict, and changes The sjstem can advance
ro farther m our country, without great and radical
changes It has come to a stand The conflict
between metallic and bank currency, which I ha\e
shov n to be inherent m the system, has, in the
couise of time, and with the progress of events,
become so deadly, that they must separate and one
or the other fall The degiaclation of the lalue of
the metals and their almost entire expulsion from
their appropriate sphere, as the medium of exchange
and the standaid of value, have gone so far, under
the necessary operation ot the sj stem, tnat they ais
no longer sufficient to form the basis of the w dely
extended system of banking.   Prom the first, he
