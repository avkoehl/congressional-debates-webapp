Is the whole of your corps to move to the north side of the Appomattox upon being relieved in the trenches by the Tenth Corps? Is the Tenth Corps as strong as the Eighteenth, or stronger?

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The Third Division, colored, goes to Deep Bottom north of the James, Ames' division north of the Appomattox, and Carr's division to Spring Hill. The Tenth Corps is stronger then mine.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 25, 1864-2.10 p. m.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps.

All the available troops General Mott can scrape together have been sent down the plank road to the intersection of the Reams' Station road, as General Hancock reported the enemy had broken trough Gregg's line from the Weldon railroad to the plank road. This leaves General Mott with a very thin line. In arranging for the transfer of your artillery to the north side of Appomattox please hold in mind not to get our contingent batteries into the works to-day or to-morrow.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

General HUMPHREYS:

Your dispatch of 2.10 p. m. received, and will be attended to.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
