THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 10,
Philadelphia has, as far as ascertained,
(and the numbers will be greatly increased,)
9,090 establishments, employing a capital of
$205,564,238$ employing in horse-power, of
steam, 31,582, and of water, 2,22G; employ-
ing 88jG31 males above sixteen years of age.
23,545 females above that age, 7,356 chil-
dren and youth; paying wages annually to the
amount of $52,236,026 ; using materials to the
value of $132,618,873 j and yielding manu-
factured products, as I have already said, to
the value of $251,663,921. And the Super-
intendent of the Census, from information
already in his .possession, justifies me in swell-
ing this amount to $300,000,000. But for the
further information of the House I will at this
point incorporate in my remarks the table iu

An abstract from the manufacturing returns of Philadelphia, as received from the assistant marshals—.correspondence not completed—respectfully furnished
tor the information of Hon. William D. Kellky, United States House of Representatives.

*1 have not adopted a classification. F. A. W.
Here, then, among these appliances for the
conversion of raw materials into the comforts
and luxuries of life ^ here among these busy
mechanicians; here, in the home of Franklin,
whose old printing press will furnish a striking
contrast when put beside the "Hoe's last fast"
or the last patent press that will be operating
in those days; here, where Jefferson and his
compatriots consulted upon the problem of
independence, where Washington presided over
the Convention which framed the Constitution,
where, under that Constitution, he dwelt as
Chief Magistrate of the country, surrounded by
the great men of that day from all the then
States; here, where, in a park embracing more
than twenty-six hundred acres of land, the
dimensions of the exhibition may spread to a
hundred or five hundred acres, and from every
point of which the eye shall be filled with nat-
ural beauty; here, at a spot accessible from
every part of the country, blessed with a rail-
road, should this commemoration be held.
I urn asked what it will cost. The amend-
ment submitted by my colleague [Mr. Mor-
rell] proposes to limit the amount that may
be expended by the Government to $50,000 a
year until 1870, when the sum may be increased
to 8250,000, making a total expenditure of
$500,000. Sir, I have no idea that under the
provisions of this bill the first year's expenses
of the commissioners will be anything like that.
But, assuming that they will, we appropriated
the same sum to send a few articles to the
Paris Exposition. Here we invite the people
of every State and Territory to present in bril-
liant array among and in comparison with the
best productions of other countries their best
productions of field, mine, workshop, orartist's
studio. And the appropriation is asked for the
benefit of the people of the more remote and
poorer States, to whose borders many an immi-
grant would be attracted by a generous exhi-
bition of the many and various elements of
wealth, in which every part of the country
abounds in such marvelous profusion.
Mr. MORRELL, of Pennsylvania. Mr.
Speaker, I now ask for a vote on the pending
question.
Mr. RANDALL. I desire to say that it was
my intention to make a few remarks on this
bill, but I recognize the wish of the House to
| come to a vote this afternoon, and therefore I
[ will forego my remarks, merely stating that I
shall take very great pleasure in voting for
the bill.
Mr. NIBLACK. We have a thin House
this evening, and, in my judgment, it is an
unfavorable time to act on a matter of this
sort. I hope, therefore, it will be postponed
until to-morrow*
Mr. MORRELL, of Pennsylvania. I pre-
fer to have a vote now, so as to take it off
the Calendar.
The question first recurred on the amend-
ment of Mr. Wells, to strike out 11 Pennsylva-
nia" and " Philadelphia," and insert "Mis-
souri M and " St. Louis.5'
Mr. GRISWOLD. I move that the bill and
amendments be laid on the table on account
of its being premature.
The House divided; and there were—ayes
37, noes 83.
So the House refused to lay the bill and
amendments upon the table.
The House divided on Mr. Wells's amend-
ment; and there were—ayes 48, noes 86.
Mr. WELLS demanded tellers.
Tellers were not ordered.
Mr. WELLS demanded the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken ; and it was decided
in the negative—yeas 38, nays 102, not voting
94; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Adams, Asper, Beck. Benjamin,
Bird, Jnmes Brooks, Burchard, Burr, Calkin. Amasu.
