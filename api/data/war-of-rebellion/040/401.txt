Major-General MEADE:

Major-General Hooker directs that you send in three regiments as skirmishers to your front as far as the Chancellorsville and Germanna Plank road, to find out the enemy's force in that direction. Support your skirmishers by a bridge. The general desires to see what is in the field to the right of the Chancellor house.

Let your line of skirmishers be strong enough to drive in the line held by the enemy.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,
