HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Jackson, Tenn., March 25, 1862.

Major-General POLK,Commanding First Grand Division:

GENERAL: I am directed to acquaint you that the general commanding has found it necessary to give orders directly to Colonel Pickett to fall back no farther at present than Kenton Station, behind the Obion River, should he find it judicious to retire from Union City. In that event he has been ordered to burn about half a mile of the railway trestle work in front of the Obion Bridge, which is to be saved. Colonel Hill has also been instructed to remain for the present at Trenton.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BURNSVILLE, March 25, 1862.

Colonel H. P. BREWSTER:

Major D. C. Kelley, of Forrest's cavalry, was within 2 miles of Monterey at daylight this morning. About 10,000 infantry and 800 cavalry encamped there last night. The number is probably a little overrated.

VI. Colonel John b. Villepigue, promoted to brigadier-general, is relieved from duty on the staff of the major-general commanding, and will report to Major-General Polk, under a special assignment for the command of Fort Pillow. The regret which is felt at parting with this accomplished and gallant officer is compensated by a knowledge of his transfer to a command where his industry, ability, and professional skill will be eminently useful to our cause.
