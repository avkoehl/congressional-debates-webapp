HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 23, 1864-9.15 a. m.

General THOMAS:

As near as I can make out the rebels have repaired the Macon road, and we must swing across it. Let me know when you will be ready to execute the former plan.

W. T. SHERMAN,Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, August 23, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The teams of my command have only five days' forage on hand; otherwise my command will be ready to commence the movement to-morrow. Colonel Mackay tells me that in three days the whole army could be supplied with ten days' forage.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS, August 23, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

General Kilpatrick represents the corn-fields very extensive down on Flint River and the country about Jonesborough, so I think we can safely depend on forage. Still I think it well to have corn in bags, and this could follow us, via Sandtown, on the third day. I would like to begin the movement to-morrow night.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS, August 23, 1864.

General SHERMAN:

I would like to commence the movement without being hurried, and can do so by Thursday night. I think the cavalry ought to have a little rest and time to shoe up. I will be perfectly prepared by Thursday with provisions, and can arrange to get forage by Sandtown the day after, if forage comes down.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, August 23, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General THOMAS:

Yours received. The general wants all fully prepared without undue haste, and will therefore postpone until Thursday night.

L. M. DAYTON,Aide-de-Camp.
