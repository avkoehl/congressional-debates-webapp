HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, September 2, 1864-4 a.m.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have your dispatch of 7.15 last evening, since which time you have a letter from me. I heard explosions and firing about Atlanta at 2 o'clock and at this moment I hear more seemingly nearer us, but due north; it must be Garrard, but what force he engages I don't know. Please ascertain whether Stewart's corps came into Jonesborough from the direction of Flat Rock, and let me know. If the firing at the north be not explained, prepare to meet any interruption of our operations from that quarter, and act without further orders if the occasion calls for it, otherwise I want you to attack Jonesborough from the east. Try and communicate with Garrard, and ascertain what the force to our rear is, and move to meet it. Our trains are at the Renfroe Place, out about four miles northwest of Jonesborough. I am near General Howard, at the Flint River, two miles northwest of Jonesborough. A road leads from here due east a little north, which I think passes by where you are.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
