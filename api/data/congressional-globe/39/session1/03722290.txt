"A glance at tho commerce of tho Mississippi will
show how necessary it is that this work should be
done immediately and effectually. Thirty years ago
steamboats engaged in the river trade aggregated
but a lew score. Now there are over a thousand. t
"In 1865 the imports of St. Louis,Cincinnati, Louis-
ville, and two or three minor Mississippi towns were
of the value of #730.000,000. As the export trade of
these places was about equal to their imports, we
have fur tiie entire commerce of theso points nearly
$1,500,000,000. But this does not include the com-
merce of New Orleans, Memphis, Dubuque, and
other important towns. Include tho trade of these
points and the aggregate value of tho tra.de ot the
Mississippi and its tributaries, the Ohio and Missouri,
in 1865 was more than $2,000,000,000, a sum equivalent
to three times the whole foreign commerce of the
United States." * * . * * * * *
"Remove theso obstructions and tho producers ot
these States will then have a convenient and ade-
quate outlet to the markets on our own sea-board and
of Europe. They can market their grain in London
and Liverpool, be successful competitorsof European
producers on their own soil, and eventually control
the price of breadstuff's in the very center of the
world's trade. In Europe land is scarce, and rents
ruinously high. The consequence is that our farm-
ers, who have cheap lands and mechanical labor, can
produce grain with profit at figures that would ruin
tho European farmer. The only obstacle that pre-
vents the western producer from underselling and
by successful competition driving foreign producers
from their own markets, is the want of cheap trans-
portation. For the past five years the'average price
per bushel of wheat in London and Liverpool has
been 37 in gold, or $1 90 of our own currency. The
English farmer cannot produce it at a less cost with
any profit. The land is mostly held by the nobility,
who exact as a rental therefor forty per cent, of the
productions. Improve these rapids, and grain can be
gent from Dubuque to Now Orleans for twenty cents
and thence to Liverpool for seventeen cents, includ-
ing cost of transhipment, ihud netting our farmers
fit least $150 per bushel and giving them the power
to undersell the English farmer m his own market,
and eventually compel him to seek other
Wheatcould bo shipped from this point to IS ew York
for thirty-three cents per bushel by the way of IS ew
Orleans, while the average cost by present transpor-
tation from the Mississippi river to New York is
sixtv-five cents per bushel. Here is a savins of thirty-
two "cents per bushel. This on thirty million of our
surplus crop of fifty million bushels annually raised,
would make the enormous sum ot &9,fc>00,000.
Now, the total value of the crops for 1864
throughout the country is shown to have been
$1,594,543,690. Of that immense amount the
five States of Illinois, Wisconsin, Missouri,
Iowa, and Minncsota produced m value more
than one fourth part. But that statement does
not show the whole truth, because these values
are values which are estimated in the States
whore these cereals are produced.
But in Boston, Massachusetts, corn last
year was §1 21 per bushel; in Illinois, it was
twenty-nine cents per bushel. It will be seen
at once, therefore, that if those five States pro-
duced more than one fourth of the value oi
the "whole crop of 1864^ estimated at home
prices, what an increased proportion would be
shown if values were more equalized than they
are now. I understand that at this moment
there are in the State of Iowa twelve million
acres of unimproved lands where the plow has
never entered.
It is not possible, perhaps, to demonstrate
more truly or clearly the national importance
of these improvements; but still I desne to pre-
sent further a few later statistics, which I have
prepared from documents subsequently pub-
lished. I want to call the attention of the House
to one single crop, and that is the corn crop
of 1865. .
In Maine, the corn product m that year was
1,692,020 bushels; in New Hampshire,_ 1,468,-
090 bushels; in Vermont, 1,796,356; in Mas-
sachuseis, 2,003,245: in Rhodelsland, 497,418;
and in Connecticut, 2,265,818; making an ag-
gregate of 10,082,947 bushels as the corn crop
of these six States for 1865. Now, if you add
to that tho corn crop of New York, Pennsyl-
vania, and New Jersey, you will have an aggre-
gate of 170,638,279 bushels as the corn crop m
that year of these nine States. The^State of
Illinois produced in the same year 1/ /,095,852
bushels; that is to say, 7,000,000 bushels more
than these nine States. Ohio yielded 94,119,-
644 bushels; Michigan, 17,520,305; Indiana,
116,069,316; Missouri, 52,021,715; Wisconsin,
13,449,405; Iowa, 62,997,813 ; andMmnesota,
5,577,795; making an aggregate of 538,851,845
bushels.
Now look at the values of corn m 1865:

The whole value of the Illinois corn crop
was $51,800,536. The whole value of the crop
of the six New England States was $11,887,334,
and yet those six States produced only one
seventeenth as much as the crop of Illinois,
while the value was between one fourth and
one fifth.
Now, sir, to get a bushel of corn from Illi-
nois to Boston would cost eighty-one and a
quarter cents; that is to say, it would cost the
difference between its value in the Boston mar-
ket and its cost at home ; to carry the corn
crop of 1865 from Illinois to Massachusetts
would cost $143,890,379 75.
The price in New fork was ninety-five cents
per bushel. The cost of getting a bushel of
corn from Illinois to New York was sixty-five
and three quarter cents, and the cost ot trans-
porting the corn crop of Illinois to New York
city would be $116,440,522 69._
The whole crop of Illinois in 186o, taking
the corn, wheat, rye, oats, barley, buckwheat,
potatoes, tobacco, and hay was ot the v alue ot
$116,274,321; that is to say, the whole crop
was worth $166,201 69 less than the cost ot
transporting to New York the corn crop alone
of 1865. . . . „ .
Now, with an unobstructed navigation ot the
Mississippi, that corn crop could be landed m
New York city, at a saving of $6-3,311. i69 09.
In this estimate I have allowed thirty-five and
three fourths cents as the cost of getting a bushel
of corn down the Mississippi. But 1 received
a letter this morning on that subject, some
portions of which I ask to have read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Office St. Louis Lead and Oil Company,
142 Second Steekt, Oorxer Wasdimtos Ivesoe,
St. Louis, April 2b, 18ob.
My Dear Sir: I am in receipt this morning of a
letter desiring me to transmit to you some mlorma-
tion regarding present rates of freights from fet. Louis
to New Orleans, &c. . _
The present rates by steamers on gram and flour to
New Orleans are: eighteen to twenty cents per bushel
lor grain and seventy cents per barrel tor flour.
I am interested in a company lately lormed tor toe
purpose of transporting freight by barges towed by
powerful tow-boats. Within the past three weeks wo
have sent out three tows of about four thousand tons
each, and have been splendidly successful. A preju-
dice has always existed among our steamboat men
and underwriters against this method of transporta-
tion, but it has been entirely overcome by the aston-
ishingly successful operation of our theory; our boats
making their trips m perfect safety and in les* time
than ib generally required by passenger steamers.
We are now taking freight to New Orleans at fifty
cents per barrel for flour and twelve to fifteen cents
per bushel for grain, ajid if-the navigation. of the
upper Mississippi was not obstructed by rapids, anu
the lower river by snags and sawyers. it eoukt un-
doubtedly be carried at these prices with profit, uom
St Paul to New Oilcans, over two thousand miles.
The advantage to the whole country by this method
of transportation can readily be perceived, and its
operations can be greatly facilitated and cheapened
by the improvements contemplated 111 your bill; ana
I cannot conceive how any person haying the inter-
ests of the whole country sijjeerely at heart could tor
a moment oppose it. t>ttt c tp pts
Yours, truly, ,, W. II. PULSI1 liii.
Hon. T. D. Eliot, M. C., Washington, JD. O.
Mr. ELIOT. The prod uce of the five States
of Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin, Iowa, and
Minnesota in 1865 in cereals and potatoes was
in bushels, 466,029,652. The produce of the
same articles in the nine States of Maine. New
Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode
Island, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey,
and Pennsylvania, was 321,494,367 bushels.
That is to say, the nine eastern States pro-
duced less than the five Mississippi States by
145,131,285 bushels, and yetlllinois, th'e oldest
of the five States named came into the Union
in 1818, Missouri in 1821, Iowa in 1846, Wis-
consin in 1848; while Minnesota did not begin
to be a Territory until 1849, and was not a State
until 1857.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. BICE, of Maine. I move that the time
of the gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr.
Eliot] be extended for fifteen minutes.
No objection was made.
Mr. ELIOT. The five Mississippi States to
which I have referred are all of them younger
than the State of Ohio, a great deal younger,
and yet the first child born in the State of Ohio
is now living in a very serene old age in his
native State; and he does not now number so
many years as may be counted by our friend,
the patriarch of the Pennsylvania delegation,
[Mr. Stevens.]
Now, we on the sea-board want to have cheaper
com; and the people on the lakes and western
rivers want to get more money for their prod-
uce. The surplus produce of those States in
a few years will not only feed all the Atlantic
States, but there will be enough left to affect
the price of food in Europe.^
I now want to say something in regard to the
St. Clair flats. Let us see if that matter is
national and important or not. I have m my
hand a valuable report upon these flats, made
