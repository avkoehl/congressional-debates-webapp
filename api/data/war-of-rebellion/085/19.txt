WM. E. KUHN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

LITTLE ROCK, September 2, 1864.

Captain J. R. GRACE:

CAPTAIN: I have ordered several expeditions fitted out against Shelby. Nothing has been accomplished yet. General West is probably near Grand Glaize now, and expects co-operation from the command which you convoyed up White River and which has just returned. I want another force sent up if you will convoy the transports. Please answer and inform me how far your boat can probably get up White River. If West gets above Shelby at Augusta and the other command below him he will be very likely to lose his artillery at least, as either is more than a match for him.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
