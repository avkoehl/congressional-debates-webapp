army will report to the assistant inspector-general, at these headquarters, compliance or non-compliance with these orders.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, May 8, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

We have intelligence, which seems reliable, that Morgan and Wheeler have gone to Livingston, Putnam County, with their cavalry force. This is doubtless a horse-stealing trip into Kentucky.

Yours, very truly,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.

CINCINNATI, May 8, 1863.

General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

It is reported that Morgan and Wheeler are at Livingston, Tenn., supposed to be moving into Kentucky. Please inform Graham and Jacob, and tell them to keep their forces well in hand and guard carefully all the fords on the river in their neighborhood. At what point are they now?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

LEXINGTON, May 8, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Your dispatch received. Have informed Carter, and ordered him to guard the crossings. Rebels returned to Manchester. Hamilton is ordered to go in search of them.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., May 8, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The following just received from Carter, from Somerset, Ky.:

My whole force, except several guards and one company of the First Kentucky now in Clinton County or on return here, is camped close around this place. If roads do not soon improve, will have to send most of mounted force down the country to forage. Will endeavor in the morning to have pasture forage for horses. Morgan will find some trouble in crossing river at present stage of water.

CARTER.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Major-General.
