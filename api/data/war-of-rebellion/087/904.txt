HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., October 21, 1864.

LIEUTENANT: The enemy did not shell Battery Harris, upon which fatigue parties have been at work for the last four or five days, as much as usual last night. The Yankees cheered last night along Gracie's front, and, when being asked the reason, said it was for Sheridan. Deserters report that the Sixth Corps and probably the Nineteenth were encamped in rear of the Second Corps three or four days since, but moved a day or two ago, either to the right or left.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Elliott's brigade, killed, 1; Ransom's brigade, wounded, 3.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Lieutenant MCWILLIE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
