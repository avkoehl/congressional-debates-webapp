COLONEL: The brigadier-general commanding directs that you assume command of your own and Duff's regiments and move at once to Grenada in accordance with Special Orders, Numbers 57, from these headquarters. This movement is ordered in consequence of information that the enemy in small force had appeared at Vaughan's Station and were moving northward along the MISSISSIPPI Central Railroad. You will send proper officers in advance to provide forage for your command along the line of march and at Grenada, and scouts to ascertain the position of the enemy. Whenever they may be found you will endeavor to meet them and defend the country against them. If they are below Grenada you will co-operate with General Wirt Adams. You will communicate all information promptly to Major- General Lee, at Demopolis, and Major-General Forrest, at Tupelo.

I am, &amp;c., your obedient servant,
