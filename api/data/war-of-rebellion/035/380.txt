NASHVILLE, June 1, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Your telegram of April 4 has just been read. I was expected to return to Nashville long before I did. It was, therefore, not forwarded to me. The principal portion is new to me. General Davis has never furnished me with any information touching or affecting your character as a citizen or soldier in the slightest degree. My opinion of Truesdail and his establishment was communicated to you some time since. It was predicated upon facts entirely satisfactory to my mind, and it has undergone no change.

You state in your telegram that you consider me your friend. You are right in this, and no one will go further than I in vindication of your character. I have never believed, and do not now believe, that you have fully understood the character and extent of the proceedings under Truesdail's direction.

It will afford me much pleasure to visit you in person in a few days, at such time as you designate, for the purpose of conferring freely and law and putting down treason and traitors. Please send a pass indicating when it will suit for me to visit you. I fear that some designing persons have been trying to make an impression intended to disturb that good feeling which was understood to exist between us while you were here. If so, it will all be dispersed.
