receipts shall exceed six hundred thousand dol-
lars, one tenth of one per centum upon such ex-
cess; but the salary of no assessor shall, in any
case, exceed the sum of four thousand dollars.
And the several assessors shall be allowed and
paid the sums actually and necessarily expended,
with the approval of the Commissioner of Inter-
nal Revenue; but no account for such rent shall

embraces more than a single congressional district,
and to assessors and assistant assessors, revenue
agents and inspectors, in Louisiana, North Car-
olina, Mississippi, Tennessee, Missouri,Califor-
nia, and Oregon, and the Territories, as may ap-
pear to him to be just and equitable, in consequence
of the greater cost of living and traveling in those
States and Territories, and as may, in his judg-
ment, be necessary to secure the services of com-
petentofficers; but the rates of compensation thus
allowed shall not exceed the rates paid to similar
officers in such States and Territories respect-
ively.

assessor so offending shall be summarily dis-
missed from office, and shall be liable to a fine of

assistant assessors shall make out their accounts
for pay and charges allowed by law monthly,

each day of service, and shall transmit the same,
verified by oath or affirmation, to the assessor of

same, and, if it appear just and in accordance
with law, he shall indorse his approval thereon,
but otherwise shall return the same with objec-
tions. Any such account, so approved, may be
presented by the assistant assessor to the col-
lector of the disuict for payment, who shall there-
upon pay the same, and, when receipted by the
assistant assessor, be allowed therefor upon pre-
sentation to.the Commissioner of Internal Reve-
nue. Where any account, so transmitted to the
assessor, shall be objected to, in whole or in part,
the assistant assessor may appeal to the Com-
missioner of Internal Revenue, whose decision
on the case shall be final. And should it appear,
at any time, that any assessor has knowingly
or negligently approved any account, as afore-
said, allowing any assistant assessor a sum larger
than was due according to Imw, it shall be the
duty of the Commissioner of Internal Revenue,
upon proper proof thereof, to deduct the sum so
allowed from any pay which may be due to such
assessor: or the Commissioner as aforesaid may
direct a suit to be brought m any court of com-
petent jurisdiction against the assessor or assist-
ant assessor in default, for the recovery of the
amount knowingly or negligently allowed, as
hereinbefore mentioned: Provided, That m esti-

assessors for periods of service less than a day,
