OFFICE CHIEF OF CAVALRY,

New Orleans, August 1, 1864.

Brigadier General R. ARNOLD,

Chief of Artillery, Department of the Gulf:

GENERAL: I respectfully ask that the horse batteries intended for service with the mounted troops may be ordered to report to me, to be assigned to the cavalry depot and Camp of Instruction near the city. I make this application to get a nucleus of formation at once in my hand, as I expect to command the cavalry forces in the campaign of this fall. It is my design to assign men to duty with these batteries from the dismounted regiments and fragments when their quota is not full.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier General and Chief of Cav., Mil. Div. of West Miss.
