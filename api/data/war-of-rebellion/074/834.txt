that I was deprived of the assistance of Captain John Vidmer, assistant inspector-general, who was severely wounded at Rocky Face Mountain early in the beginning of these movements.

I feel that my thanks are due in an especial manner to Captain Macon, assistant adjutant-general, who was wounded on the 25th instant, and to Lieutenant E. Q. Thornton, aide-de-camp, for their services, invaluable to me at all times and in all places.

I regret that that zealous and faithful officer, Colonel L. T. Woodruff, Thirty-sixth Alabama, was dangerously wounded on the 25th instant.

Hereto is appended a list of casualties of the brigade from the 7th to the 27th of May, inclusive. Of the large number reported missing nearly all, except those captured at Cassville, as above stated, I fear, are either killed or mortally wounded. It has been the fortune of this brigade to be among the foremost in nearly every engagement since the beginning of the campaign, and hence its casualties are perhaps greater than those of any other brigade in the army. Consolation, however, is found in the settled belief that it has inflicted far greater damage upon the enemy.

Profoundly thanking God that, under the circumstances, "it is as well with us as it is;" that the brigade has lost nothing of its fair name won on other fields; renewing to the gallant dead our solemn pledges that the future shall prove they have not died in vain, we await its record with becoming trust and confidence.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. D. CLAYTON,

Brigadier-General.

Major R. A. HATCHER,
