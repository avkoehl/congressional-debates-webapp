Brevet Brigadier General J. W. FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff, Middle Military Division, Winchester, V.:

The Second West Virginia Veteran Regiment has just been consolidated from the First and Fourth Regiments. The First, which composes most all this regiment, has been for the last two months at and in the vicinity of Cumberland working on block-house. The old Fourth has only a little over three companies on paper. I sent it to concentrate with the remainder of the regiment and to be properly officered before leaving the department.
