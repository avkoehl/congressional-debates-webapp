1870.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
year ordered by law to meet biennially only,
so that appropriation was made in part for last
year, and $107,000 in addition is-required for
their expenses for the next year.
The Legislatures meet by order of law, and
by the same lav/ the Secretary is obliged to
estimate for their expenses over the amount
of which he has no control. What extrava-
gance or corruption is there in this?
Again, interest and matured debt was appro-
priated for last year at $128,690,676, instead
of $129,177,815 for this year, making a differ-
ence of $387,139. Certainly an estimate to
pay matured debt and maturing interest is
not to be charged against the Secretary of the
Treasury as extravagance. My colleague would
not have the debt and interest on it repudiated,
would he? He has not joined the member
from Ohio on that question.
Again, the Treasury is charged with head-
money on seamen, which it receives and pays
out; but as it cannot be paid out of the Treas-
ury without appropriation the Treasury must
ask for an amount of appropriation equal to
what it expects to receive. Now it is hoped by
the Secretary of the Treasury that in 1870-71
commerce will revive, and instead of getting
$180,000, which was asked for last year from
seamen, he asks for $190,000. making a differ-
ence of $10,000 more than in this year; of
course not paying oat any more than he re-
ceives, because in that he is limited by law.
Again, when goods are imported collectors
receive as security deposits of sums more than
sufficient to pay the duties on the invoices.
Those sums are paid into the Treasury. When
the invoices are settled and the accounts liqui-
dated the excess is paid back. The more
importation the more excess; but it does not
make a dollar's difference in the Treasury.
Now, the Secretary believes that next year he
will have $200,000 more of this money to re-
ceive and pay back than last year; and this
makes another item of the excess. Is it extrav-
agance to estimate for it when the Treasury
cannot lose a dollar?
Again, the Secretary is obliged by law to pay
one half of all the fines, penalties, and forfeit-
ures which he receives to the informers. Now,
as he means to enforce the law more strictly
this next year than the last, he estimates that
he will have more to pay. Therefore he asks for
an appropriation of $300,000 out of which to
pay, instead of $275,000 last year; but he pays
no more than he receives. Is this evidence of
corruption ?
Again, the law provides that the Internal
Revenue Bureau shall return taxes erroneously
received. Now, as the Secretary means to col-
lect more revenue next year than last, it is
supposed that there will be an exeess of taxes
erroneously received to pay back, and there-
fore he asks for $400,000 next year instead
of $390,000 appropriated this, or $10,000 in
excess. Is it corruption to ask authority to
pay back what you have wrongfully received ?
Again, the opening of the southern coast to
trade since the war, and the building of new
"light-houses ordered by Congress, calls for an
expenditure of $99,104 more than last year.
Would the gentleman from Massachusetts cut
off the light-houses from the seamen and leave
the southern coast unlighted because of the
devastations of rebels ? Will he charge that
against the Secretary?
Again, the Coast Survey asks for $234,000
more this year than last. That is rendered
necessary to finish up the Pacific coast, and
the southern coast affected by the changes
which since the war have not been surveyed
in many ports and harbors, and to extend the
survey to Washington Territory. Is this an
extravagance which the gentleman would cut
off, and complain to the country as against his
party that the Secretary of the Treasury was
more corrupt than Andrew Johnson for put-
ting the necessary expenditurts in the esti-
mates?
I ask him which of all these except the public
buildings, with which the Secretary hasnothing
to do, will he refuse to appropriate for ? These
altogether make an amount of $7,259,415, or
$57,110 more than the whole excess of Treasury
estimates, not allowing that the Treasury is
chargeable with extravagance with the excess
of $6,000,000 of public works of last year
which Congress has ordered.
I have thrown all this into tabular form, so
that every one can examine ititem by itemand
see precisely how the matter stands, and I give
the page of the book of estimates so that my
colleague will have no difficulty in following
me:

I might stop here with a thorough vindica-
tion of my former colleague and friend, the
4 Additional estimates, chiefly for Pacific coast and
southern States. (See pages 262 and 263, and after
Appendix LJ
Secretary of the Treasury; but I do not. ■ I
desire to call the attention of the House and
the country to one or two other cases of ex-
travagant estimate rendered necessary bv the
administration of Andrew Johnson which he
did not think it worth while-to estimate for;
and I trust upon this topic my colleague will
be valiant and instant in his defense. Johnson
pardoned all the counterfeiters of the currency
out of prison, insomuch that the Secretary of
the Treasury'thinks he ought to have $50,000
more funasfor theirdetection and punishment;
thus catching those Johnson let loose. Does
my colleague think that an extravagance ?
Again, being determined to enforce the law
and collect the revenue, and as onQ of the last
acts of Andrew Johnson's administration was
pardoning whisky thieves, even to such an
extent that some of the pardons General Grant
revoked, the Secretary of the Treasury asks
for $100,000 more to the detective fund of the
Internal IievenueJBureau. Does my colleague
charge that as an extravagance ? In behalf of
which of Andrew Johnson's whisky thieves
will the chairman of the committee report to
cut down that appropriation ?
Again, the purchase of Alaskaunder Andrew
Johnson, forwluch my colleague voted andldid
not, makesit necessary to keep one or two rev-
enue vessels at very great expense carrying coal
to them in that far-off region, sothattherevenue
service is largely increased. Who was to blame
for that extravagance, Mr. Chairman of the
Committee on Appropriations—your vote or
the Secretary of the Treasury?
But before I leave this subject, after this
thorough vindication of the Secretary of the
Treasury against all charges brought against
his estimates, I propose to show that though
by his administration tkese estimates are nomi-
nally increased, yet the items do not show ex-
penditures. Take, first, $3,817,000 of interest
on Pacific railroad bonds, which will be and is
being paid by the railroad by transportation
and services, and the balance to be paid by
them in money; and thus nearly four million
dollars is accounted for without a dollar of
expense—part of the $331,000,000 which my
colleague charges to the extravaganceof Grant's
Administration overthe $308,000,000 for which
Johnson estimated last year.
Again, here is still another of my colleague's
charged extravagances. By the 1st of July next,
at the present rate, the Government will own
$140,000,000 of its own bonds, which in the
coming year, if the accumulation is permitted
to go on, will be brought up to $200,000,000,
or nearly one tenth of the entire bonded debt
of the United States. And the interest on these
bonds during the year 1870-71 will amount to
quite $10,000,000, which is estimated for in the
$331,000,000, and makes a part of the charge,
$49,000,000, of extravagance of General Grant' a
administration over that of Andrew Johnson.
But I grant my colleague the mercy of my
silence upon this part of his speech. How could
he without examining all these facts arraign
his party, his Administration, and his friend
before the country for extravagance, corrup-
tion, and almost malversation in office ?
STATE DEPARTMENT.
My colleague has not seen fit to pay his
respects particularly to the State Department.
Perhaps the small difference of $32,000 was
not worth his while, especially as $10,000 of it
was for the publication of the laws rendered
necessary by the law itself, and the balance was
for contingent fund, that, fund having beeu
drawn down in the latter years of Andrew
Johnson.
But to this Department, like all others," let
us apply the true test of economy, expenditure:
and my colleague will find the difference in ex-
penditure by the table which is in my hand, that
the moneys disbursed in the last year of Andrew
Johnson, in the fiscal year 1868-69, to bo
$441,887, while that of the year 1869-70 was
$347,804 94, making a difference of $94,083 ;
