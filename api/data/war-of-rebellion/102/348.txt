HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS,Little Rock, Ark., May 8, 1865.

Honorable JAMES A. BUTLER,

Helena, Ark.:

Yours referring to the raising of a company to be commanded by Mr. Fisher is received. Authority to raise military companies for special service has been directly declined by the War Department, and the company, if organized, must be a home colony. Such companies have been formed in many parts of the State, and are doing much good. Without adopting any general rule, as each locality seems to require special treatment, I have furnished these companies with means of defense, and in some cases with provisions, until they can raise for themselves. The companies act under orders of the nearest post commander and are not paid by Government. If Mr. Fisher will raise a company of 100 men or less I will order that they be furnished with ammunition and, where necessary, with arms, the captain being responsible for them, and, at the discretion of the post commander, subsistence while in pursuit of rebels. In short, without taking these companies into the U. S. service, it is designed to aid them in every way possible in raising crops this year and in ridding the country of guerrilla bands. The Government will commission Fisher as captain.

Very respectfully,

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Commanding.
