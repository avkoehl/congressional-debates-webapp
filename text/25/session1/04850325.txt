tedtheie, (m New York) than the Government would other
wise have    He asks, if the bt ites of this Union vveie separate,
as in the time of the colonic , would not the exporting ¡states
import for themselves'   No, sir, they neter did import foi
themselves when they were colonies    A law mateiial reeion,
an agricultural country, cannon be also a mercantile and manu
fictunng   a ship building and money capnal country     The
trade ol Virginia was carried on befne the Revolution, by Eng
lish meichants and shipping, and since then by New England
merchants and shipping    True, the English merchants sen'
their ships directly to our rivers on the Chesapeake, but then
there was no coasting trade, which now does the same thing for
us to the full extent of oui wanta and demands
The gentleman from South Caiohnaalfao csmplams that the
Bank ol the United States, in 1832, gave the President a swoitl
to bury m the vitals ofnullification' Sn, this is a new chaige,
stiange and extraordinary in its charactei, and coming from an
unexpected quarter
It it be "a true bill" against the bank, that it furbished uV
means of defending the Union in its peril, it will be a new and
unheaid of recommendation of it to some, though not to me I
repudiated the doctrines of nullification I struggled against
its principles and practices, and deprecated its ellects and ten
dencies, but,sii, if the wai upon South Carolina had come "to
the kniie," it would have found many a Union man of Virgini l
fighting in her defe ice, though th0y had aigued she had hei full
share oí wiong m the quarrel I should have been one among
those who reasoned on one side, and wouldhare lought on th~
ottoei No corps of a standing ai my should e\ er have ci ossed A n
*'rija holders, with my consent,to invade a southern sistei State
libeiefoiesay, sir, that this charge against the United Stats
Bank if tiue, no recommendation oí it to me Nothing íe
coinmen is itself to me which strengthens the arm of the Esccu
tne But, ir, this charge cannot be tenable Beit lemember
ediha^ the bank itself was then (in 1832) stiugglmg against that
same Piesident loi its own safely and existence, and that then
be was waning against it furiously, upon the ground that it had
tnteied the political lists ag unst his re election I cannot con
eclve, therefore, upon what gioundb it is now accusctl ol fur
niching weapons to ihe hands of its own enemy, and that, too,
to destiny some of its own best fnends Among thosestiongesf
iueiidswere then counted the Hon Geoige McDufhe and the
Hon lolin C Calhoun1 And most strange and unaocouuta
ble is it, if this chaige be true, eithei as to the motives oí tht
bank or its necessary effects, that Mr Calhoun should, so soon
aftei the fall of 1832 as the spring of 1834, propose in the Se
nate oí the United States 'o lecbauci this same bloody monstet
ior twelve years'" Ihe gentleman sir, must be wiong now,
ot lis lionoiable und distinguished Senatoi must hive been
most u.ipaidonably and egicgiously guilty of a suicidal act of
southern policy m 1834
Ihe gentleman boasts that the people of the South aie an old
fashioned people, and he complains that the hank, like Czai
Peter, cut the coats of southern village dandies in the fashion'
This is astill moregnevous chaige against the tyiaimy of that
nionstu, winch it seems was guilty ot monstiouties from the
most enoi mous—the plucking of a President's beard, to the
most petty—that ol clipping the coat tails of southern dandies'
1 d d, no doubt, affect the social habits, as well as the political,
financial and commercial powei of the country But, sir, this
objection, though apparently frivolous, has more in it than
strikes us at first It illustrates the nature and degree of that
prejudice which ieally picvails in many communities, which
aie not immediately connected w th the associations of trade,
again t that institution

they live Noble, geneious, iibeial minded, brave, independent,
intelligent and sagacious, yet are many of them too metapht/u
cal, and likely—as Mr Letcher used to say of old Virginia—to
dirof an. abstraction' They admire and cheiish old things
and waj s, and despise, without much reason, improvements in
the credl system, just as they do a new lapel or button' They
do not enlarge, as I said on a foimer occasion, their capacities
to teceive the benefits of any institutions oí trade, they do not
calculate then losses m the destiuction of them when cieated
ail ex sting, but look alone with dissatisfacuon to thegieatei

complaints about the immense advantages of capital which a
Bank oí the United Stales gives to the Noi lb If we sit all the

niesume, he v. ill find the friends of a national bank divided, but
sn he will find no one opposed to the annexation of iexas, be
cause lavoi tble to a national bank But what does this allu
sion to H\ is meani Is it a political appeal! Is it expected
bv any qualter that Texas will unite the south upon some
leadei aid that the South added to the Loco Foco destructives
0Í the North, and the Execntn e letmue of New Yoik and Penn
sylvama, will bring that leader m o power* Sir, let im. warn
those who entertain it tha' the hope is vain, and worse lhan de
lusive' The South is most opposed in reason and interest to
Loco Focoism and it will be unjust and destructive to the cause
ol 1 exas, to mai/e it a hobby of party politics The ie=toration
of a sound cuirency heie would aid Texas as much as our
selves W hence has that glot ions Republic dcnved her loans
to achieve the battles of hei libeity and independence? Ihe
South and Southwest have furnished her with arms and men
he North 1 presume, has iurmshedncr «ith monev and credit
If ber wais still continue, still she will want the benefit of that
ívstem here which carried us thiough the travails of mde
pendénce, a system of credit' yes ours was depreciated paper
°r A Bank of the United Stales would not only indirectly aid
tin rau e ol civil liberty in Texas by the confidence and ere
¡lit safe and sound, it would diffuse universally, but, as I
have «aid «would prove, at this time especially, the best bul
walk o? civil liberty in the United States' Sir I mean all I say
The bank is expedient and necessary, the only question which
S  remains is, is it " propel," that is, congenial without free insti-
tutions!   What has been the practice and tendency of the Ex-
ecutive of this Government foi the last eight years?   To wield
the enure legislation and contiol of this nation and its destinies,
by means of the public money'   There la needed, much needed,
an interposing stumbling block, or check, between the Presi
dent and the public purse, now more than ever'   When Presi
dent Jackson removed the deposites, he took them from out of
the hands of the law—of the legislative depaitment    When ha
put them in the pet banks, he put them in the hands of the Ex-
ecutive, theie they have been ever since, in defiance of the law
and the Constitution, and now we are asked to yield the con
sututional custody and control of Congress over the public mo
ney, and to place it m the Brianati hands of a hundred thou
sand office holders—"the eyes and arms of the Exrecotive'"
To what department of this Government does the custody and
control of the public money belong!   Sir, there is an obscure
clause of this Constitution winch has ever been overlooked by
all of the wisest of its expounders    I mean that sacred clause
which reads  " Congress shall have power—
"To make ali laws which shall be necessaiy and piopei for
can ymg into execution the foregoing poweis, and allofher
poweis vested by this Constitution in the Govet nment of the
United States, or m any depai tment or officer theieol "
Now, sir, the first clause of this section is the only part of it
which is habitually leferred t , and is a clause, by the bye,
which is not favored generally by stuct constructionists, be
cause it is erroneously thought by some to confer indefinite
powers No such thing The" reverse is the case By maik
ing the latter clause attentively, you will find that there is not
a section in the Constitution more jealously restrictive, .and
especially of Executive power anddiscietion It wtliat claus 
which General lackson never read, oi never understood It con-
tradicts his celebrated rule of action, "that he was to execute the
laws and the powers of the Executive as he though proper '
Sir, the Executive has no disci etion as to the means of execut
ing its own powers even, much less the powers of Congress.
The means necessary to execute the "foregoing powers," that
is, the powers of Congiess, "and all other powers vested by
this Constitution in the Government " Mark the gradation of
descent from generals to pai uculara, " oi m any department
or officer thereof' Does this not mean Executive powers?
All the means necessary to execute all the powers of every
department, or officer, are given to Congress1 Does the Presi
dent require means to execute an Executive power even? May
he adopt means, however necessary or proper, himself' No'
he must apply to the legislative department Such is the Con
stitution, yet how perverted, and abused, and trampled on'
Sir, I am thus minute in commenting on this clause, so restne.
tiveof Fxecutive powei and discretion, because, I repeat, there
is no clause of the Constitution which is so much overlooked,
and never regarded
-,To íllustiate its application    The question arose lest winter,
in the case ol Texas—to what depaitment does the power belong
to vecogtue© tho independence ot a pe iple BUuggbng for liberty
and foi an equal station among the nations of the earth! To
my utter surprise, on examining Judge Story's Commentary on
the Constitution, I found that he lays it down as a power be
longing to the Executive, because he says it is incidental to the.
power of appointing and receiving ambassadors He entirely
overlooked that clause in the Constitution which clearly vests
every incidental and resulting power of the Government in
Congress Thenee, sir, is denved the power to collect, to
keep, and to pay away, the money of the United States Con
gress may appoint a hand, an agent of the law, to do and per-
form all these duties independent of the Executive, for "Con
gress may by law vest the appointment of inferior officers, as
they think proper, in the President alone, in the courts of
law, or in the heads of departments " But the custody and
control of the public money have been usurped by the Execu
uve, in which almost all incidental and resulting powers have
merged, and have been tamely and supinely yielded by Con
gress' Su, I know of no way so wise and so appropriate to
reclaim thisdeiehct and important power as that oí creating a
national corporation, which shall be made the agent and hand of
the law, which the Executive shall not touch or control, and
which shall be subject only to the legislative will'
The gentleman from South Carolina (Mr F) is utterly
wrong, then, when he says that to create a banlc will be to pait
with an attribute ef sovereignty—to leeulate thecurrency Sir,
it will regain and restore the just and constitutional powers of
Congiess, and it will be the most complete and efficient check
which can be put by law upon Executive absolutism' In this
point of view it would become the aigis of constitutional libeity
Expenence teaches us its weakness as a political «ngmc It
was in favor with one Administration, the Administration died,
it was opposed to the succeeding Administration and the bank
died Admit it, howevei, to be as dangerous as it was ever
chilged with being, is it more so than the substitutes which
have been tried and proposed! It may, foisooth, concentrate
and unite the money power and the political power of the conn
try and Government The pet bank system certainly diá thus
unite them and elect a Piesident, and the Sub Tieasury system
is an open and palpable proposition of dnect and certain
union between the pureeandtheswmd' Such is the consisten
cy ol these pretended patriots who war upon a bank as a pobti
cal monstei, and yet go "all for the" money in the hands ofthe
Executive' The bank is more "proper' m this sense lhan any
substitute which its enemies have ever yet proposed
The gentleman, sir, in good feeling and friendship, advised
me not to rely on the letter writeis for a character, bat to look
lather to enlightened public opinion 1 shall tale the advice,
sir, foi, fiom the bibngsgate which has lately beensent foi th
from the desks in this Hall—[Here Mr Wise look d signih
cinth at the Beat of Iohm H Prentiss, a member from New
York, the editor ot the Freeman's Journal, in that ¡state, and
the letter writer for his own paperj-l am well aware that a

fiom the pen of falsehood dipped m the gall of biltei ness, and I

?her constant vituperition Some of the letter writeis I know
woe gentlemen, and the fnends of truth more than they are
mv friends, but I rely not oa them, but on enlightened public
nninion My own convictions as to a national bank are not
new and have not been taken up for a party purpose or for a
season, they are as old as my public life, my constituents have
knmvn. them of old, and they aie not to be relinquished for th«
Ske of a triumph to myself, or of triumph over an enemy, oi
for fear of defeat, though, sir, I am confident that they are c< n-
notions which will eventually seize upon the mmds of all as
they have fastened upon mine I have been for «bank through
