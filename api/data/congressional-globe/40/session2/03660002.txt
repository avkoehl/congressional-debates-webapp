Rev. C. B. Boyxtox, Chaplain of the House,
offered prayer as follows:
Almighty God, our Father who art in heaven,
we come to worship Thee as King of nations,
supreme on earth as Thou art in heaven, and
we implore, in the name of Jesus Christ, Thy
Son, our Mediator, a blessing upon our nation, ,
represented in part by the public men now be- 1
fore Thee. O God of nations, may Thy bene-
diction rest this day upon our country. May
every interest of this great people be remem-
bered of Thee. Wilt Thou care for them all
and give, success to every proper effort made
in everydepartmentof human industry? Grant,
we beseech Thee, O Lord God, that every one
of our American interests may be guarded by
Thee to-day, who art the keeper of our Ameri-
can Israel. We implore Thee, O Lord, to grant
a special blessing unto these legislators now
assembled to begin a new session, a new career
in the public duty to which they have devoted
themselves by the voice of the people; and as
' Thou.hast been pleased to give theni wisdom
in time past to settle properly, as we believe,
so many great questions, arm them anew with
wisdom from on high to meet each great issue
that shall be presented hereafter, so that all
shall be done not only to the satisfaction of
their fellow-men and of their own consciences,
but also so as to meet the approval of our
God. And as the American policy twines itself
now more and more with great moral and re-
ligious considerations, may there be no falter-
ing in reference to any great measure, but may
all be done so as best to secure every proper
right of man, and so as to honor and glorify
God.
We pray Thee, 0 God, that Thou wilt re-
member the Speaker of this House. As Thou
ha-jt been pleased to enable him in time past
to discharge his great duties so honorably unto
himself and satisfactorily to others, wilt Thou
give him all needed support and wisdom for
the future.
We pray Thee to remember and bless the
Senate of the United States. Bless the Presi-
dent also; bless all his advisers, and remem-
ber those who judge, so that the united action
of the departments of this Government may
best secure the great interests and welfare of
the country, and also honor God.
We pray Thee to remember, 0 Lord, our
population in all its needs. Remember not
only the prosperous, but the poor and the sick
and the needy. Remember those who mourn;
remember tliose who are degraded and cor-
rupted. for they are still our fellow-men, and
Thou, O Jesus Christ, hast died for them. We
pray Thee that Thou wilt put in operation such
causes as shall relieve, elevate, refine, and
save. May Thy kingdom with all its benefi-
cent influences be established over the whole
land, and may all nations speedily come to the
knowledges>f the truth, for Jesus' sake. Amen.
