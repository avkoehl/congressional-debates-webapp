TUE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. HUBBARD remarked that when he was
up before, he stated that, if his honorable friend
from New Jersey should not accede to his request,
he should vote for the amendment proposed, and
he also stated that he was much in favor of the
bill repotted at the last sessior from the-Com-
mittee on Pensions, and which has become the
law of the land He very fully concuried in the
views of the Senator from Massachusetts, in rela-
tion to this whole subject He never had regarded,
and he never could regard, the present pension
system, as it existed under ourGovernment, and
m pursuance of the vauous acts of Congress, as
mere gratuities If he had viewed this subject in
that light, it never could have received his sup
port. He had had some connection with the act
of June 7, 1832 He was, at the time of its pas-
sage, a member of the other House, and at the
head of the Committee on Revolutionary Pen-
sions, and sure he was that when the bill was
reported from that committee, and while it was
undei the consideration of the other House, it was
at no time treated or considered as a mere act of
generosity, as a mere donation on the part of the
Government It was, mi his opinion, but an im-
perfect dischaige of a most just, but long neglected
debt, to a small remnant of the survivors of the
Revolution, a debt contracted when the Govern-
ment could not pay, hut which was then uncan-
celed, and due to those men who had achieved
the independence of their country It was for
such a class of our citizens—men who had faith
fully served, m that day of danger and discour-
agement, for a period not less than six months,
m the war of the Revolution—that the act of July,
1832, proyided Can it be said with even the
shadow of truth, that these men had been bona
fide paid by this Government for the services
which they had thus perfoi med for their country'
If so, how, and in what way was this debt of the
Revolution discharged > Certainly it will not, at
this time, in this period of our prosperity, be said
that the final settlement certificates, a paper which
when given could not have been converted into
specie at a less sacrifice than three fourths of its
nominal value, was a fair, honest, and just liqui-
dation of these claims for revolutionary service
He never had, and he never could, view this mat
ter m this light He had seen too many of those
men who had fought the battles of the Revolution
He had heard too often then stories of suffering
and distress, which they were forced to endure by
reason of the miserable, depreciated, and almost
worthless currency in which they were paid for
their services in the Revolution, and when he,
as the organ of the Committee on Pensions of the
other House, recommended the passage of the act
of June, 1832, it was urged and sustained through-
out as a measure providing for the partial pay-
ment for i evolutionary services
The act of June, 1832, was m its terms but an
addition to the act of May 1, 1828 It must be
fresh in the recollection of Senators now present
upon what principle that act was sustained Was
it then considered as a gratuity to that class of
our citizens who had faithfully served their coun-
try to the close of the Revolution 5 It provided
for them, and it provided only for them The
Continental Congress had, by resolution after res-
olution, made liberal provision to those who should
continue in the service to the close of the Rev-
olution First, half pay for life, and that com-
muted for five years'full pay The non-fulfill-
ment of these resolutions, the manner in which
the services of these men had been requited by
their Government, induced the passage of the act
of May, 1838 All admitted that it was a most
just measure of legislation, and the act of June,
1832, was but an extension of the benefits of the
act of May, 1828 ft granted pensions to those,
whether militia, State, or Continental, according
to the peuod of then service, withholding pen-
sions from those who had rendered a less period
of service than <*ix months This was the general
provision of the act of June, 1832 It was founded
on íevolutionary service, and on that alone, it was
intended to make some satisfaction for that ser-
vice, and for that alone It may be well to just
trace the history of our pension system, and see
how the several sets granting these annuities were
passed The act of March, 1818—the first general
pension act—seems to find favor here, and the
several acts granting pensions for disabilities in-
curred during the Revolution, and during the last
war, seem also most justly to find favor here. I
Will any Senator say that the act of March, 1818, '
was supported on  the ground of mere gratuity'
that it was passed on any such ground'   No   It
was suppoited, and it was passeu, on the ground
of service     It is perfectly true that the act of
March, 1818, was not only extremely limited in
its provisions—including those, and tuose only,
who were attached to the continental line—but it I
was also extremely humiliating in its requisitions
Its benefits were intended to be extended only to
those who were either tenants of the poorhouse,
or supported by private charity.    But, neverthe- |
less, that bill was also founded on service alone,
and, under its provisions, a much largei number
than was ever anticipated was added to the pen
sion íoll
This led to the passage of the act of 1820,
which, for a time, suspended the pensions which
had been granted under the act of March, 1818,
and which required that schedules of property
should be furnibhed, that the Department might
judge whether the applicants were in such indi- i
gent cucumstances as to need relief fiom the
country.    It was done, and the consequence was
that nearly one half of the number who had been i
placed on the pension listundei the aU of March,
1818, were never remsiatcd     It must be reool
lected, that more than twenty thousand had, at
one time, been admitted under that act, and when
the list of pensioners under the act of June, 1832,
is oompared with the list under the act of March,
1818, it should be borne in mind that probably
not less than one third jf those now pensioners
under the act of June, 1832, were once included
in the list of pensionéis under the act of Maich,
1818    The actof June, 1832, includes those who
served in the militia and as State troops, as well
as those who served in the Continental line for six
months and upwaids, granting pensions, in pro-
poition to the period of service, equal to one half
the original pay, not in any case to giant i pen-
sion for a period of moie thin two yeais'service
while the act of March, 1818, grants a pension
of ninety-six dollars a year for any period of
service not less than nine months     It is not, I
therefore, difficult to account foi the difference in '
the number of pensioners under these different
acts    He was perfectly awaie that there were not |
less than twenty five thousand on the list under l
the act of June, 1832, while there were less than '
ten thousand undei the act of March, 1818, but
it should also be remembered that by the pro-
visions of the acts of Congress, invalid pension-
ers, for disabilities incurred during the war of the
Revolution, are entitled also to all the benefits of
the act of June, 1832    He, therefore, found no ,
difficulty in accounting for the difference in the (
number of pensioners under the act of March, .
1818, and the number under the act of June, 1832  |
After these acts had been passed, Congiess, by i
a law of 183b, extended all the benefits of the act i.
of June, 1832, to the widows of those soldiers of P
the Revolution whose husbands had died before i
the passage of the act, and where the marriage
took place before the expiration of the last period I
of their husbands' service    This act, as far as it
went, he venly believed met with general appio-
bation through the country     It was regaided as
an act of justice, as well as humanity, but it was
extremely difficult to understand the reason why
those widows whose marriage took place befoie
the expnation of their husbands' service should
be pensioned, and those widows, whose marriage
took place immediately aftei the close of the rcv-
oluüonaiy struggle should be excluded     There
seemed to be no good reason for the distinction,
it was invidious m its chiiaeter, it was unjust in
itseffect, and memorial aftermemonal.resolution   |
after resolution, were intioduced with a view to  |
do away with this distinction, and the Commit- ,
tee on Pensions, at the last session, responding '
to these calls, introduced the bill which is now
under consideration   It was reported, had its sev    I
eral readings here, was parsed, had its several I1
readings in the other House, and was passed, and J
during its progress not one word was heaid id
either branch in opposition to the measure   And f
what is now proposed'   That the appiopnation ji
necessaiy to carry it into effect should be with-
held, because the act could not have been well  1
considered   Congress failed to do its duty at the  j
last session m not making the requisite appropri-
ation; and he presumed that Senators supposed II
that this act, with the acts of May, 1828, Jane,
1832, and June, 1836, contained a clause making
the necessary appropriations to carry it into effect
He presumed that a majouty in this or the other
House could not be found in favot of repealing
this act, and it seemed to lum passing strange
that, while the act exists in the statute-book,
there should b  a single Senator who would vote
to withhold the appiopnation, and th^s defeat
the practical opeiation of a measuie which has
been sanctioned fry the legislative power of the
Government
Mr CALHOUN regaided the whole system
of pensions in a light far different from that  n
which it was viewed by the Senators fiom Mas-
sachusetts and New Hampshire "With the ex-
ception of the first pension act, he looked upon
it as little more than a system of distributing the
public revenue It grew out of the protective
system, and was founded on no principle of jus-
tice or patnotism, for it took all who served m
the Revolution, and put those who only turned
out on a tour of thiee months on the same foot-
ing as those who had fought the battles of the
whole war He understood this system from
beginning to end, and it was comme-nced as a
means of disbuismg the public revenue which
had been lmquitously collected To tell him that
all those now on the pension list deserved the
bounty of the Government, was to impose on
him a humbug too gioss to be listened to. Pen-
sion laws were passed, and there were swairas
of undertakeis here and m the States who bunted
up documents and brought forward every descrip-
tion of claims, just oi unjust, and passed them
on the Dep&i tmeut without a possibility of their
guarding against the grossest fraud m a number
of cases Itwis impossible foi Congress to pass
pension laws without having a plenty to support
them To show how the system opeiated, he
would mention one fact Before Congress under*
took the business of pensioning the soldiers of
the Revolution, Massachusetts and South Caro-
lina each had pension laws, of their own The
pension list of South Carolina amounted to the
sum of $14,000 annually, while that of Massa
chusetts amounted to only $1,000. Well, Con-
giess took these pensions in hand, and after the
expnation of several years the pensioners of
Massachusetts are swelled up to J,2QO,000 per
annum, while those of South Carolina receive
only $10,000 Now this fact alone would show
that the pension system did not originate in pa-
triotism, because it would not be denied that the
patriotism of the one State was as great as that
of the other It was time that this thing was
stopped, or they would have to run the country
in debt to provide for it He knew very well
that as long as there was money in theTieasury
it would be got at, but he thanked Providence
that the time had come round when  hcy must slop
short m their career of extravagance We had
now no surplus, and the compromise bill was
bringing down the revenue, while there seemed
to be a general disinclination to increase the na
tional debt Hetook his giound beforehand, and
solemnly declared that he neverwouldagieeeithei
to inciease the tariff or create a new debt, and he
called on all those who thought with him to re-
sist, at the outset, any measure which led to those
evils He rejoiced at the crimination and recum-
mation which he heard on that floor between the
tw o contending parties on the subject of extrav-
agant expenditure Both parties, in his opinion,
were in fault, but the Opposition party, who were
the most foi ward in making these chaiges, were
ceitamiy the most in fault As an Opposition
paity it would be more becoming in them to do
all in then power to check extravagant expend
ltures, but instead of that, it was mainly through
their means that our expenditures had been so
gieat He warned the friends of the Adminis-
tration that it was now time to economize This
year we might get through with our expenses
without embarrassment, and so, also, as to the
second year, but the third year the press would
come, and we should have the utmost difficulty
in making our resources meet the necessary wants
of the Government
Mr BENTON observed that the Senator fro 
Massachusetts [Mr Davis] had arrayed before
them the wounded men of the Revolution,mashed
to pieces by ball, and covered with wounds, and
asks if we would take away the small pittance
