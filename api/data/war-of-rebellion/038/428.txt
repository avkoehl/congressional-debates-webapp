the remainder of his brigade, to enable him to withstand a cavalry attack. The attack will come from Black River, from above Bridgeport. Instruct Osterhaus, in case it becomes necessary to abandon hi position, to effectually destroy the bridge and join Sherman, who goes out to meet the enemy about Bear Creek. Your forces should have strong pickets to the rear, to guard against a cavalry dash.

Major General J. G. PARKE, Commanding NINTH Army Corps:

[W. W.] Loring has crossed a portion of his troops below Vernon. An attack is contemplated, evidently by way of Bear Creek, and that within two days. Move out four brigades of your command to support your cavalry and obstruct their advance as near Big Black River as possible, until all the forces to spare can be brought against them. Travel with as little baggage as possible, and use your teams as an ordnance and supply train, to get out all you may want from the river. The enemy once fixed upon my ground, all the forces from Haynes' Bluff can be taken to the attack and a large number from here also. Move out early to-morrow morning, or sooner, if you can.

General PARKE:

Sherman goes out from here with five brigades and Osterhaus' DIVISION, subject to his orders, besides. In addition to this, another DIVISION, 5,000 strong, is notified to be in readiness to move on notice. In addition to this, I can spare still another DIVISION, 6,000 strong, if they should be required. We want to whip Johnston at least 15 miles off, if possible.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN, Comdg. Fifteenth Army Corps:

Information just received indicates that the enemy are crossing Big Black River, and intend marching against us by way of Bear Creek. They probably will start out to-morrow. I have ordered Parke to move out with four brigades to support his cavalry and hold the enemy as near Big Black River as possible until their position is clearly defined, when we can draw all our forces from Snyder's Bluff and the forces previously indicated here to their support. Tuttle's DIVISION should be marched out within supporting distance of Parke at once. You will go and command the entire force. Your wagon train can move from wherever you may be to Lake's Landing or Snyder's Bluff, whichever may be the most convenient for supplies and ordnance stores. When on the ground you can draw troops from Snyder's Bluff and the three brigades designated from McPherson's corps directly, without communicating through headquarters. Should any [further] forces become necessary, I can take them from our left by leaving that in the same condition it was before the arrival of Lauman and Herron.

U. S. GRANT.
