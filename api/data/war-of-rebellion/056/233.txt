CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, November 23, 1863. (Received 6.40 p.m.)

Maj. General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Willcox's dispatch of yesterday to you was repeated to me from Louisville. From the time communication with General Burnside was cut off till the present, I have been sending dispatches to Willcox, giving him all the instructions necessary. He has been retreating too fast to get them at the points to which they were directed. His dispatch to you was for effect.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, November 23, 1863.

Brig. General O. B. WILLCOX,

Cumberland Gap:

Your dispatch of yesterday to General Halleck has just been repeated to me.

If you had shown half the willingness to sacrifice yourself and command at the start you to in your dispatch, you might have rendered Burnside material aid. Now, I judge, you have got so far to the rear you can do nothing for him.

Act upon the instructions you have and your own discretion, and if you can do anything to relieve Burnside, do it. It is not expected that you will try to sacrifice your command, but that you will take proper risks.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, November 23, 1863-12.50 p.m.

Major-General FOSTER,

Cincinnati, Ohio:

Should we send you more cavalry, to what point shall they go? Two regiments will soon be ready.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, November 23, 1863. (Received 2.50 a.m., 24th.)

Major-General HALLECK:

The two regiments of cavalry are needed and should be sent to Lexington, Ky. Other re-enforcements will be required to build and guard the roads. Of their wants I will telegraph from Knoxville.

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General.
