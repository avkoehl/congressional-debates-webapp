of [July, 1862,] when discharged. The company was organized by Captain [John Smith,] at [Cumberland,] in the month of [July, 1861."]

Numbers 5. FOR DISCHARGE WHERE NO PAYMENT HAS BEEN MADE.

9. The same as Numbers 1 to the words 'sooner discharged"-"from the [25th] day of [July, 1861,] when enrolled, to the [4th] day of [July, 1862,] when discharged. The company was organized by Captain [John Smith] at [Cumberland,] in the month of [July, 1861,] and marched thence to [Baltimore,] where it arrived the [25th] day of [July,] a distance of [one hundred and twenty-five] miles."

10. If the blank muster-rolls furnished for use do not contain all that is directed above, in each case, they will be altered by the required additions in writing. The words "when discharged" must be written, if not there already, next after the last date of the term, to which the muster is to be made, on all rolls for that purpose.

11. It is expected that muster-rolls for discharged, of large size, and with the addition which will be found in paragraph 49, will be prepared and furnished seasonably for that purpose; if not, the blanks now in use (for payment) will be altered by the additional two columns. The blank rolls for discharge should contain a large excess of lines, beyond the prescribed organization, for the names of all who have died, beyond the prescribed organization, for the names of all who have died, been discharged, &amp;c., and the column of remarks should be near a foot wide for necessary remarks.

12. Where a change of captain or colonel has taken place, by promotion, or otherwise, the name of the new captain or colonel will be embraced, and the name of the first commander will be interlined after "company," as [late Smith's,] or after "regiment," as [late Tod's,] so that the original commanders may be shown during the whole term.

13. If any other person than the President called the force into service, the name of such person, with his official rank of station, will be inserted in the caption, and under what law, authority, or circumstances the call was made: vide paragraph 1640, Army Regulations, and an act to amend an act calling forth the militia, promulgations, and an act to amend an act calling forth the militia, promulgated in G. O. 91, Adjutant-General's Office, 1862.

14. The date of enrollment in the caption and one of the columns will be that of the day of arrival of the company, with organization complete or full, at the place of general rendezvous, in compliance with orders from the proper authority, but not prior to the day specified in the order; which date of enrollment will be the commencement of the term of service and of public supplies, unless otherwise specially directed, without regard to the date of muster or that of previous company organization.
