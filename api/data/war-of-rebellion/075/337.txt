HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,May 28, 1864-6 p.m.

Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I have just passed all along my line from right to left. Everything is all right, and our line occupies the proper relative position to the infantry. General Carlin opened some guns on the enemy, which stopped the skirmishing. The report concerning a movement on our left was false, though I was led to believe it from their attacking my front so determinedly, and at the same time skirmishing heavily with our infantry. I will feel them at sunrise to-morrow, and advise you at once of the result.

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.
