which was  noble m ihe icpublican simpiicit) of its   i
structure, and destined to solve the prob'em of the [|
capacity oí roan to govern himself, should be made   i
to depend on the will of banking coiporations tor   I
5>Q important an element of its success as  the cer-   I
tain command of its revenue     In placing it, in   I
this, way,  at their mercy, it was exposed in its
financial affairs to all the evil influences wh ch ihey
might exert, whether arising from caprice, p litical
hostility,  or the vicissitudes of trade     Nor was
this exhibiting the danger anting from this sjstem
in its irue extent    It could be demonstrate t   hat
the banks of oni/ single one of the Itngt commei ci il
cides, in  a period of over-üadmg, would have it
entire!v m their power, by suspending specie pay-
ments, to compel a genei al suspension of all the   .
banks throughout the United States, and, by doing
so,  arrest the regulai operations of the Govern-
ment '   The banks of a single city in one of the
eastern States  at a very g'oomy period of the last
war, availing themselves oí the balances which had
accumulated in then favoi, m the course of trade,
against the large commeicial cities of the mi Idle
Slates, had, by a demand on them for payment in
specie, caused a suspension by the banks through-
out the United States '   This movement struck a
blow at the Government, which had well nigh
proved latal to the success of all its operations m
the  gieat contest in which it was thai engaged
That it was, in a great degree, the result of hos-
tility   to   the  cause   in  which the  count!y hid
embarked, was then extensively behe\ ed, nor has
that impression to this day been removed
The State banks are, from the touisc of com-
mercial tiansdctions, so intimately and closely con-
nected togethei, that what affects any portion of
them in any one of the principal cities, is, to a
greater or less ettent, felt by all The stoppage of
the hanks at either of the great commeicial points,
almost with the quickness of electricity is ¡ell by
all, and is followed by all throughout tne country,
as a measuie of self-protection If this was pioven
to have been the case by the occuirenct oí that
kmd uhich took pi ice m the last war, the circum-
stances of the country which now exist aie still
more peculiarly calculated to produce such a re-
sult The great increase m our internal tnadf, as
well as foreign commerce, and the. rapidity of com-
munication now existing between the lemotest
points of our country, had produced a still closer
connection and sympathy between the banks than
formerly existed, and doubly subjected all to the
danger of being affected bv causes operating on a
few at a single great cominei cial point
He had shown the gieat uncertainty and danger
which the Government, by depositing its revenue
with the banks, would be continually hab'e to, m
its financial affaiis He had shown that these re-
sults might be brought about b> the determination
of the banks, at a single leading commercial cit>
Was it the dictate of wisdom thus to place this
already great and rapidly grow mg Republic under
the control ol a few great commeicial cities, in a
matter so material!) involving its success, as well
as its very being? Was it sound policy in that w ay
to expose its financial action to the deleterious in-
fluence of the national bank of England, and the
great moneyed povver of that country"! Much the
larger portion of the foreign commerce carried on
by our great cities was with England He was
mfoimed that even a very large poitionof the trade
carried on by 4.meucan m=rchints with other
foi eign countries, was conducted b) me ms of credit
obtained thioa¿h the gieat banking houses in. th^t
country
It was the misfoi tune of our great cities, if it was
to be regarded as such, almost constantly to stand
indebted to England in a very large amount
Whenever our ineichants overtrided with her to any
considerable extent, her n tional bank could if she
chose it, pioduce a piessme thiough them on our
city banks, and pioduce tne hazard of then stopping
specie pajments Hei poweifu' agency to accom-
plish such acatistropbe inav be seen in the suspen-
sion of specie payments b) a'lofour banks which
has lately occurred m this country The fust
movement which led to that unfortunate result was
that made by tnat bank, by which she compelled
thefgreat banking houses ot England, connected
wiih the American trade, to discied t Amencan
ne'ehants Indebted to England as theyweiem
a sum estimated at about thnty millions, and una-
ble longer to draw bills to meet tneir pa) menu on
her banking houses, which hid betore given them
almost unlimited credit, the} weie driven to the
only other expedient left them of malting remit-
tances m sptcie, the demand for which compelled
the banks first m our great commercial emporium
to close their vaults
Nor would a ■íational bamk have shared a dif-
ferent fate, it one had been in existence, under the
same overwhelming causes It would no doubt,
have been forced, undei the great and extraonl
nary pressure for specie, to have yielded to the
storm To re unite the Govern nent with the
banks, would be, therefore, to subject it, in a
penod of ov er-tradmg, to the dangerous influence of
the great moicyed powei of England, operating at
such a time, first on our merchants engaged in fo-
reign trade, next on the banks, and, through them,
on the finances of the Government It its indepen-
dent e wa to be preserved—if its regular constitu-
tional acaon was to be kept up, impelled alone by
the vigor of th^ public will—then the separation of
its financial interests from the banks entirely was
a measure indispensable That alone could se-
cure to the people, in its administration, those gr=at
and important enc's in a íepubhcan form of Go-
vernment to which he had allu'ed, and free it
liom ine extraneous influences which threatened
such sei ious mi*chief
Nothing, said Mi B was of gieatei importance
to the happiness anl piosjientv oí a people, than
stability m the monetary concerns of a country
Could an) one hope to see so desirable an object
accomplished so long as the Government remained
connected w ith the banks by whom the circulating
medium or the oountrvwas almost entirelj sup-
p id1 Could any one hope to see an end ol th se
wais on tne curiencj, which had been so inces-
santly waged, for some years past, by the party
opposed to the administration, m the hope to con-
vince the people that they had acted unwisely
in refusing to agiee to the recharter of the national
bank1 Was it to be expected, if the Government
was again ie-umted to the bank"', that party vio-
lence and ambition would not again strike at the
moneyed affairs of the country, constituting as they
dd the most sensitive nerve in the body politic,
vvih a view to drive the administration from
powei^ When the national bank was refused a
rcch ttr, it became the s gnal for that attack on
the State banks which has been so mcessanlly
kept up ever since The removal of the
public deposites from mat institution, furnished
another excuse foi the same course of hostility,
greatly emb ttered by their having been placed by
the Government in the State banks When com-
mercial embarrassments began to thicken over the
country, when it was plainly perceived by the
keen-eyed sagacity of the managers ot the moneyed
pow ei, that the banks had endangered themselves
by excessive issues, then it was that the vv ai w ?s
pushed with íeneued vigoi, m the hope no doubt,
that the blow which would result fiomthe sispen-
s on of specie payments would prove decisive of
the fate ol ihe administration
He h"d noticed «rae v,eeks previous to the
banks having stopped specie payments, the simul
taneous movements of ceitain p esses, demoted to
'he inteiestsof the Banl oft e United States, tend
mg to produce that result They predicted th it
the banks w ou'd stop, and some of them zea-
lously urged them to that course He did not
posi ively know that it was their design,
through the instrumentality of a panic to bung
about that lesult to which then labors had power-
full} tended for so lrng a time, but the time, the
mannei, and the circums anees, all w ent strongly
to favor that supnosition The lime selected foi this
movement, when mercantile failuies v/ere daily
occurring, wa  of all others the most favorable to
prodace distrust and alarm in the publ c mind, as
to the solvent y of the banks, and consequently, to
cause a general demand on them for specie, by
depositor , and those who held then notes The
manner of the attack, by commencing it about the
same time at three or lour important points, distant
from each other, showed it to be, if not a matter of
concert, at any rate a singular coincidence Tne
circumstances under which it was made, were ex-
ceedingly well calculated to produce the political
effect doubtless aidently desired by those engaged
in the crusade against the administration Very
many of oui citizens were involved in heavy
pecuniary embaira^sments, the fruits of the wildest
speculation The States—many of them m the
anticipation of receiving their proporton of the
surplus íevenue—had embaiked m expensive plans
of improvement, and the whole of the pu Vic reve-
nue belonging to the General Government was
depo^ ed in the banks thus liable to be affected In
this state of things, it was no doubt imag ned by
many of those who are desperately determined on
producing a political revolution, that to s'op the
banks was lo pull down the administration It was a
blow which, by the sufferings it inflicted, was to
awaken the slumbering community to the merits of
a national bank It would disappoint *he Slates m
tneir expectations of receiv ng the suiplus revenue
I mally, that it would stop the wheels o Govern-
ment, and afford the enemies of those in pow ei the
opportunity of exultmgly pointing to its bank-
ruptcy, and proclaiming the mismanagement oí its
revenues He regarded the great bod) of those m
opposition as honest and patriotic citizens, and was
fai from believing that they w ere prompted by such
motives as he had alluded to, but at the same time
he felt regret at being compelled to expiess the
be'ief, forced on him by the circumstances he had
descrioed, that there were some to be found among
them ready to compass their objects at me expense
of the prospen'y and best interests of their country
It would not, he thought be doubted on a can-
d d íeview of the histoty of the last three or four
years, that the connection betwe°n th  Government
and the banks had invited and been made the cause
of the harassing waifare which, t) subsen e party
purposes, had been, in that space of time, almost
constantly kept up against the deposite banks , and,
consf q ently, affecting to a great extent the inte-
rests and business of the country The streams of
the money circulation nevei can run ciear 01
smooth while they are liable to be muddied and
lashed into impetuous violence by being mingled
with political excitement The country will be
perpetually liable to etpenence inundations at
one time m ifs circulation, and al another to suffer
sudden reactions The true remedy is, then, te i emove
the cause, by severing the connection b tween the
Government and the banks By doing this, many
of the most poweiful motives to produce agitation
on this most delicate and sensitive question will be
effectually removed
Another consideration, by no means of secondary
importance, m favor of such a step, is the expe-
diency, if not absolute necessity, of confining within
more moderate bounds the relation of debtor and
crediloi between the Government and its citizens
While the banks are emp'oyed as the depositories
of the public revenue, they must necessaril) loan
itout to individuals to indemnity themsehesfor the
trouble and risk in keep i g it, and for the interest
wuich they aie hound to pay on it to the Govern-
ment The public mo iej thus loaned out by them,
though nominally due to the banks, is, in leahty,
ow mg to the Gov ernment The relation of debtor
ton, m th s way, becomes ramified thioughout
e ery part of tne countiy, a íelation which, when it
exists to ail) considerable extent, is dangerous to
the existence of the Government which creates it,
and destructive of patriotic sentiment in the citizen
It is. the firebrand by which fact on tnay inflame
public feeling, and by which civil war may be
lighted up If th° Gov ernment is at any time com-
pelled to demand us money from the banks, when
they are piessed, designing po'iticnns would not
fail to ascube the pressure which it might occasion
to tyrannical and itnworthv motives
Let us suppose that the Government, at 'he pre-
sent time, instead of granting indulgence to the de-
faulting banks for the large amount of monev due
it, was to yi«-ld to its necessities, and resort to
agid mi asures to enfoice its immediate pajment,
can any one doubt but that appeals vould be made
to all the interested and selfish motives of those
who are indebted, to array them against those at
