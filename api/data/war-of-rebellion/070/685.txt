Lieutenant Colonel CHARLES G. HALPINE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Present:

SIR: I have the honor to report, for the information of the major-general commanding, that the Government agent here has no transportation whatever. It is, therefore, impossible to send 40,000 pounds grain to meet the command of General Averell. The teams of our command, we they here, would not be able to haul empty wagons back across the hill, even supposing the road to be clear; and if General Averell was to send horses to carry the grain, I doubt if he would be able to do so as it would take 400 horses to carry the amount required, allowing each horse to carry 100 pounds.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. ALEXANDER,

Acting Chief Quartermaster.
