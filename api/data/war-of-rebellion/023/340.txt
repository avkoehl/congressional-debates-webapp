Gallatin; that the force which attacked us at the bridge was 100 strong; they left the same evening; that 17 of the enemy's killed had been found in the neighborhood of the affair at Camp Creek.

These statements are corroborated by several others who came in yesterday. A party of workmen went up this morning to work on Camp Creek Bridge, with a guard of three companies Eleventh Michigan. Railroad men say they can have the line open Monday next if we will guard workmen. They propose to abandon the Edgefield and Kentucky road and push the work on the direct line. The engines and train which were sent up to Red River yesterday have not been heard from; something wrong. Mr. Marshal proposes to send out train on Edgefield and Kentucky Railroad with guard to get back the engines, if possible, and the men of Fifteenth Indiana guarding the road, and then abandon it. Please answer soon.

JNO. F. MILLER,

Colonel, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 15, 1862.

Colonel MILLER, Nashville:

It will not answer to send a guard and working party to Gallatin until you have some knowledge of the movements of the enemy, especially when from your report it is probable that they have gone in a direction from which your guard would be easily cut off. I apprehend that your detachments on the Edgefield road may have been captured. My orders are not obeyed. Instead of fortifying their posts and defending manfully the guards lounge about without vigilance and are gathered up by the enemy as easily as he would herd as many cattle. One resolute company, properly stockaded, could defy Forrest's whole force.

Colonel MILLER, Nashville:

Withdraw the guards from the Edgefield road. The safety of your guards on the other road depends on whether the enemy has left that vicinity. You know best about that. Have you no information about his movements? Where is the recruiting going on? Have they rendezvous where they could be captured?
