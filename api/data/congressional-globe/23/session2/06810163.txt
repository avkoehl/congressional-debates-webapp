Mr PE\ PON rc¡ e and addressed the House
as follow)-                                                                       '
Mi   Nmm   I am partiil to inaioce voting,
and especially to titaioce siting   This partiality
and my gieat anxiety to avoid encroaching upon 1
'he constitutional powers of the next Congress, 1
induced me to vote in favor of laying the resolution I
offered by the honorable gentleman from Illinois
[Mr Reskolds] on the table, that I might offer
what I am compel'cd to submit as an amendment,
wi'hout any incumbrance whatever What I am
about to propose, will secure ¿viva voce \o*e in all
election's, and assert the light of each Con¿tess to
elect its prmtei I have never seen the t meorp'ace
when 1 was the least embairassed in declaring foi
whom I intended to vote, and I hope I never shall
be so craven in smut, so lost to that independence
wlu h is native in the bosoms of my constituents,
as to crouch, and hide—do mu thing and say ano-
ther
And sir, I must be per mired to defend the
citizens of my netive State from those imoutatiins
which have been -ast upon eh who vote by ballot
in their elections Tennessee has voted in that
manner in the election of all her officer  for near
ly forty years, and she ha? notlo t her liberty, her
gallan ry, or independence. And if gentlemen
think so, they are mucn mis'aken No sir, such
thmg3 depend upon the tone of sentimentamongst
men, more than the mere mode of expressing that
sent.roent 1 he man who would respresent the
chaiac'er and fee'ings of her people, must be
frank, candid, and independent, must be a plain
case—no h'ding, nor dodging If you ever see a
gentleman at this—who cant be found—you may
feel, but cannot see him—who leaves no sign—
can't tell which ei d of the road he has gone—if
you catch him out in a snow, get on his track end
are confident you have him, but when you come
to find out, he has turned the heels of his shoes
before ard you are on the back track—such a
man is no Tennesseean
Butwhi'e I vindicate the character of Tennessee
from those suspicions which have been thrown
upon her on accouni of the mode cf electing pub-
1 c officers, ingrafted upon that constitution which
Andiew Jackson aided in forming, and retained
by her recent Convention after thir'y eight yejrs
experience, I "m willing tha' all elections by Con-
gress shall be mu toce I like to hear gentlemen
speak out boldly on this floor, as well as else-
where, for of all thing , 1 have the least taste for
hypoency or double dealing But sir, I am
equally anxious to secure another object, which
must be dear to my honorable colleagues who
agree in poU'ical sentiment with me, and my
friends from Alabama, New York, and elsewhere,
and that is the right of each Congress to elect its
own printer. I know we all agreed in oui consti
tutional views on this subject last winter It was
a question which produced much excitmentmmy
district, and in the State generally I gave my
views, as I am now about to express them and
pledged myself to my constituents, if no one else
did, to offer a resolution embracing substantially
what I now offer on the subject of pointer, and to
move to go into the election at the commencement
of the last session I did not do so, and this re-
quires an explanation to my constituents My
apo'ogy is to be found in the fact that after I had
my resolutions.prepared, and was on the eve of
presenting them, I wos?e(/iie íeiito permitan oldti
and much abler member of this body, my friend
from Alabama, [Mr. McKinlft,] who addressed
the House on baturday, to offer the resolutions,
to this I assented with gieat pleasure, but he was
thwarted by the introduction of Mr McDtFFic's
resolution on the deposite question, which was
debated the greater part of the session I am
proud of an opportunity of ledeeming my pledge
to my constituents, and at the same time enabling
my honorable friends to act out their principles,
and aid me in lerlaimmg foi each Congiess the
exeicise of its inherent and constitutional lights
I have adopted the only mode by which this can
be effected, and at the same time secure a m«
toce vote 1 have no petty pirty puiposes to
subseive We were for it •Hthela'rt session upon
princple, and cannot be against it at this Our
party is overwhelming in strength, u is committed
on this question We \m\e said that the Constitu-
tion has been violated by an expiring sess on of
Congiess e'ectmg a punter for a new Congress,
and let us not bring upon ourselves the reproach
of inconsistency, but nobly step forward to the
rescue of the Constitution
Able unanswerable arguments have been made
on this question in the other end of the Capitol,
by a great statesman and true Democrat, which 1
am sure will have due weight with alt, and with
none moie than my friends from New Yoik I
ahude s r, to ihe pe weiful argument made by the
honor die Thomis H Rentom, in the Senate, on
tie 19 n, and published in the Globe of the 291
Februaiy, 1833, on the motion to go into theelec-
tion of public printer He had, on the 13 h of
t*ie same month, introduced a resolution, the sub-
stance of which, I have embraced in my amend-
ment It was a joint resolution of both Houses—
so is mine It changed the time of the election of
pi inter from the end of the expiring C ingress to
the first week of ihe new Congress, so does mine
Here Mr Benton's resolution stopped, mmegoes
furthe-, and declares that the election of punier,
and all other elections, shall be mva wee And
ihis is the only material difference between them
I confess that 1 should have been somewhat at a
loss as to the powers of tl is House, in repealing,
or in any measure cnangmg, a joint resolution of
both Houses, wl ich has received the "anction of
the Pi e ident, bm for the light which that able and
inde'augdble Sena'or has shed upon this subject
1 had looked upon the resolution of 1819asuncon-
stitutioi a! ard \oid, so did he. and he oopear3 to
la^e been prepaied to sustain that p oposition,
whenever it should be presented But when the
question arose whether the Senate could recognize
its val'dity a« ajoint resolution, and at the same
time change any one of Us features, by a single
resolution, he promptly decided that it could not
This, su , was with me an unansweiable objection
to voting for the re olution of the gd tleman fiom
Illinois It is a single resolu'ion, which will
change the mode of electing a pr.nter from a vote
by ballot to viva joee, under a joint iesolution,and
change it m nothing else, thus recognizing ua
validity m every word and sellable, except as to
the mode of making the eleetio 1 It cannot be
done We haie a piecedent, duectly in point, I
quoie from Mr Bemtos's speech before alluded
to     Ml   B  said
" His present object wis to prevert an election
' at this session, \nd for this he had a good pre-
' cedei t, onginating in the Senate itself, piecisely
1 in point, in every particular. He referred to the
' election of a public printer towards the close of
' Mr. Adams's admmistraiion, when Mr Green
' was elected over Gales &, Seaton The election
' cameon, several ballotingstook place, Mr Green
' had a plurality of the votes, not a majority of the
' whole The pint resolution under which the
' Senate balloted (iheiesolu'ion of 1819) expressly
' declared that a pluiahty should be sufficient, but
' the majority, on the eve of proceeding to the
' bailo', had passed a smgle resolution, to control
' thejotni re olution, declaring that a majority of
' the whole should be necessary to a choice The
' supporters of Mr Green claimed the election,
' but the majonty adhered to their single resolu-
' Hon against the tei ms of the joint resolution, and
' refused to Dermit the election of Mr Green to be
' declared He (Mr B ) then moved that the
1 ballotings shou'd be discontinued Theyweie
' discontinued accoidingly No election of printer
1 was declared The session terminated without
' any further proceedings on the subject At the
' commencement of the next session a resolution
' was brought in, declaring that Mr Green had
' been duly elected at the preceding session He
' (Mr  B ) voted for the íesolution "
It passed Can there be a stionger, clearer case
in point' Here the Senate went in 0 the election
under the j nnt resolution of lfcU9, but passed a
«ingle íesolution, altering it so far only as the
number of votes necessary to constitute an elec-
tion was concerned Thit su g e resolution was
declared to be a nullity by the Senate at its next
session on the ground that a joint resolution could
not be altered or changed by a single íesolution
And the Senate and House of Repiesentatives, in
lb29, did, by a joint resolution of both Houses,
make the alteration which had been attempted to
be midethe preceding session by theSenaiealone,
and declared that a mtjonty of the whole number
of vo'es gi\en should be necessary to a choice in
the election of printer, but lea\mg the resolution
of 1819 unchanged 111 every othei particular
Now, sn, have not the Senate and House of
Representatives each ected on this question of
altering the íesolution of 1829, by a single res-
olution, and decided that it cannot be done    I
