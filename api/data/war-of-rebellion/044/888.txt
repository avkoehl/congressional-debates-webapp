NEW YORK CITY, July 14, 1863. (Received 12. 30 p. m.)

SIR: Have seen General Wool. All the military which he can reach has been called for, but it now numbers only about 800 troops. These are aided by nearly 2, 000 police. Governor Seymour has arrived, and General Wool reports him as co-operating heartily. He has called out several regiments, and General Wool has sent to New Jersey for two regiments; but, as far as I can see, the means of defense are entirely inadequate to control the present force of rioters. The military had a collision with the mob in Thirty-fourth street an hour ago, and used ball-cartridge. Result not reported. The rioters are now (12 o`clock) in possession of Mayor Opdyke`s house, and destroying it. The chances appear to me to be against the immediate restoration of order in the city of New York. Will keep you advised of situation.

SIR: You may judge of the capacity at headquarters here when every effort cannot extract any more information than I have forwarded. Excuse me for saying that this mob is testing the Government nearly as strongly as the Southern rebellion. If you cannot enforce the draft here, it will not be enforced elsewhere. The example will prove contagious, and similar events transpire in every large city. I you send sufficient force here to demonstrate the power of the Government, its effect will reach every part of the country, and one settlement answer for the whole. Immediate action is necessary, or the Government and country will be disgraced.

Respectfully,

E. S. SANFORD.
