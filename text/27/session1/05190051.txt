Now this mode oí hasten ng expenditures for the
mere purpose of creating a defkit id the Treasury
at the end of the y ar, was, m his opinion, neither
wise nor exped'erit Tnere was lso a wav of di-
minishing the receipts of the Treasury. These
might be affected to a considerable extent by ihe
advice given by the S ere ary to ihe President in
relation to the public lands He (Mr W ) would
askhow many pub'ic land sale shad been adver-
tised by ti e new Administration during the three
months, that it ha1! been in power Have there
been ten' have there been five? have there been
three? Whereas in the same period, during the
preceding Administration, you will find nearly
twenty But the nursing of his resources, and the
curtailment of his expenditure!, may hnve been
prevented by oih=r pressing and more important
avocations oí the S°eietary, hjhas, as Bolingbroke
said, on ins pece si n to p iwer, in the quotation
made the o oer day, friends at his eloow to reward,
and enemies to pun sb, and to do this efficiently,

Now if he expended out of the exi t-
írg and p rmanent appropriation
only an amount equal to the whole
new  ones,   ca'hng   them   eighteen
millions (and tbey differed  enher
way not a ihird of a million)        -   18 000,000
It would pay them, and lea- e to him     $7 943,000
This would be enough to redeem all
the  old Treasury notes out at the
beginn ng of the year, being about      4,600,000
And leave a balance of
These were all the notes likely to be
paid in, and all which fell due, and
quite one fourth of a million of
thsm, for reasons explained ths
other day, would probably not come

Thus raising the balaree to -
This balance then, would cover all
contingencies and fluctuatiens in
expr-nsos and receipts not very ex-
traordinaiy It would also, enable
him even tn spend the maximum

have tn hand quite

This uoj'd be the natural result on the exis mg

It is wer hy of rema k,here, that in this view of
the «ubjeot, wi hout including any expenses or ap-
propriations of tois extraordinary «ession, (?s
should be the case when looking to the q <estmn of
the p 1 r nee s Hy for calling it,) there no Id be
ne th°r debt nor «■ficitnh  provided f r dnrmj-
ihe whjie of ne prcei t 5 ear, much les ihe ensu
ing three months
Again, there would be even next year, no d>bt
becoming due, except Ihe new Treasury notes is-
sued in 1841, over and above the amount re-
deemed
This would be about             -          -   $6 000,000
From that deduct the above balance
on hand, and the nett burden next
y>ar would be, from this source,
short of     -           -           -           -     4 500 000
Leaving however, in the Treasury, 1st January,
1849, a b hnee somewhat smaller than when 1841
heg"n, or t nly about on<? quarter of a million, m
c tiding what is in the M nt
It may be next a matter of wonder how the Se-
cretary could reach a result so d fT-rent from this
—how he rcarbed the conclusion that both the debt
end deficit of this and the ensuing yett), when umtfd,
shodl} b Ovier twelve millions, or °ometbing more
tfcrn my calculation of what would be likely, if
ae mg in a manner nrces'pry an) usual, by .ibout
$7 5d0 000
But I can render it perfectly mtellie b'e to the
Sena c, in a m< 'e moment, how his exc s- aiosi-,
and, thoi gh he m?y n ake it occur in the end vi t
it w II b  seen tn what unsubstantial ground it is
sought to be jusiifi d
Thus, be computes bs expenditures,
under the ex sting appropriations,
higher than 1 cus 0-nary, on a given
amount of then, by $5 000,000, and
higher  ih^n should   b", under ad
conungercies by   -           -           -   $3,000,000
Then    I e    compates     expenditures
onder   new    appropriations,   pre-
pared eiihei  10 his 3 or 10 months'
e tun tes,   anl   uhch   hive   not
Leen    ma'e,   may   not   be,    and
wsu'd not Invt been, this year, ex-
cep* fur this extra sessun, over    -     3,(00,000
Then he estimates his receipt  from
customs  and lands too low, as we
heretofore explained, by at least   -      I 100 000
And the e •sccount for the whole diffe-
rence of    -                                       $7,500,000
Beside thn, there were other excesses in expen-
dituie, and under e timatcs in receipts, to very con-
siderable amounts, in his computations, as former-
ly d-"ai'ed, but wnich need not be legeated íjace.
11 this «ay goes by Ihe board his n.ho)?^6ei(4t&
neai ■■ x millions, and the debt and ^efievj jfttf
tins ard the ensuing jear, of about tw-elyejmiilioi^,
wnh the m siaken and inflated pA«ntaMro'§ot oí
thirty on" or forty millions, and leaves behind oaly
the small fragment of Treasury notes «rjiebj m^ty-
fall due next year, over and aliove t|>e balance in
the Treasury. That is likely to eqjal, if no new
appropnatnní are made, and ihe old ones spent-no
m re rapidly then u ual, only about four millions
and a half
This is th> mole-hill which has been swoll^p by
Wh g ihe'onc so often into a mountain. And
even ih s would have been all extinguished, bad
Congress reasonably, as was again andagapq urged,
siopp d the imuwnse new draws on the rerenaeby
new judicial constructions, and modified the draw-
backs, so as to c nform to their original pnno^?.
It would, also, all have been easily paid ip¡ 1844 
had the United S ate<. Bank not failed agam-nt©,^
ly and forever, it is feared since th  je«r beg%n—
and strewed t! e whole country v th fragmeu's of
wreck, as well as given a deadly stab for a time to
our credit abrotd, and to foreign confidence in
American integrity.
Yet the past Admmwtrat.cn is taunted wiih a,
debt, thrugh in leality so diminutive, and though
crea'cd, if at all, only by accidentand procrasttnaUpn
in necessary legülai 0 ', us well as by makonduci
in banks. Taun ed, loo, in this report, vs hichj With
us supp ement, proposes 10 create deliberately, de-
signedly, un I without any u^g^nt nece^uy, under
the new reirenchir"* Administration, a furtner new,
peimanent national deb  of twentj-eight or th iiy
ailhons.
This, hen, is the aUidude of the tvo Adminsfra-
u ns on this iobj ct The p stone, charged sgain
in I agair, in most 1 -snton v ru'ence, as havi g
cus d a debt ot fnty millions, instead of four to
five, <-nd the pre'ent r forming one, which brings
ihe groundless charge, recommending a new debt
of twenty-eight or thirty millions im ead of only
four or five.
That Administration adjured Congress (o be
sparing in appropriations, and to revise the tariff
laws in season, to prevent any permanent debt
v hatever in a time oí peace, while this one, on the
contrary, with careful deliberation, and ¡n time of
peace with all foreign powers, recommends a new 
permanent, volun'ary debt oí neartbiriy millions.
The former foil >wed the lessons and wisd >m o(
a es on this subj c , as condensed by Mr Gallat n
in his. late interesting pamphlet on the banks and
ihe currency. "A public debt (says he, pages S3
aid 29) was a'aays an evil to be avoided when-
tvet practicabl , hardly ever justifiable except in
time of war It h?s a tendency, perhaps, more
than any other cms , to concentrate the nation !
wealth mo the hands of a small number of indi-
viduals," "and it letdsthe drones ol socieij "
iiat, the present Administration disregaids the"
ages of 0 her t nits, and even the admonitions oí
hat ficancier, once sueh an oracle with the chair
man of ihe Committee on Finance The past Aet-
ministr?tion, or raihcr the person who now addres-
ses you,is a s5 threat r ed heie by the Senator from
Maine with having desirved impeachment, be-
cau e, unoer vhat ins party has denounced as pro-
digal mi ru1-", 1 deemed it a duty lo remonstrate
against any attemp to advance money, except tor
short periods, and in limned amounts, or to ex-
p nd it by subordnate officers either waste-
rully or piematuiely—while the present Ad-
m mstiat on—ihe boas ed reformer —seem ar-
d nt to jts'fy the 11 w Secretary in letting
it be advanced, as any person mav desire eitherss
1 > ti ne or amount, and ^e expended in all kinds
o< profusion, so as to produce, m only twelve
n 01 ths, an excess of expenditure over what is custo-
,-iaiy__equalling near  five   Bullions of  dollars.
Oneier this retreaching and frugal Administration,
1 :.m, it seems, to be punished for my labors ana
watcb/ulaess to promote saving, and to check
'avi h ¡vaste—while my succes.or, for tne opposite
course, is lo be puffed and idolized. So be it.
History must, after a time, be set right on this and
several other top.es.
I would stop here, sir, were it noi that my
