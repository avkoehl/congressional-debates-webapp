HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,February 15, 1865.

Major-General ORD,

Fort Monroe:

General Graham has returned, and reported nothing of importance. The Richmond Whig of to-day says:

We learn that a naval party, consisting of 12 officers and 100 men, under the command of Lieutenant (Tacony) Read, were recently captured by the Yankees near Smithfield, Isle of Wight County.

We do not deem it prudent to give any information as to the object of their expedition, and think we are sufficiently explicit when we say that they started for a purpose, failed in accomplishing it, and are now, no doubt, in a Yankee prison, doing anything else than blessing their luck.

They report having met no force of the enemy, except a small party, losing one man, captured.

The cavalry return by land and expect to be in camp to-night.

Soldiers belonging to the working or non-slaveholding classes much disaffected, and that we may expect
