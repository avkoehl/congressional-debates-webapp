Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLONEL: I have just now an officer of my staff, who has been with my picket-line commanded by Colonel Winthrop. He rode with the colonel, and they saw the rebel troops along the woods beyond the corn-field. My picket-line is along this line of the corn-field. Colonel Winthrop is satisfied that the enemy are there in force. My pickets are still pushing on slowly.

Very respectfully,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

COLONEL: Colonel Stone went out with 100 men. He sends me word that with 400 additional men the present line can be held; and, second, if it is desired that the line shall fall back, he wishes to know.

Very respectfully,

R. B. AYRES,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, SECOND DIVISION,August 22, 1864.

Lieutenant CHOISY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that after much difficulty I succeeded in advancing my pickets to the white house, driving the enemy's pickets back. After holding the house for a few moments the line fell back to their original position, reporting that they saw the enemy moving to the left. My officers are all very poor and the men of the Second Brigade worse, and I have had great difficulty in getting the line up. I have again advanced the line; will report further.

Very respectfully,

F. WINTHROP,

Colonel Fifth New York Veteran Volunteers.
