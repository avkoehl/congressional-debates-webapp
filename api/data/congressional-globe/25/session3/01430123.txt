Mr HUBLEY asked the consent ot the House
to take up and consider the bill for the relief of
Peter Moore and Co and otheis, which was
agreed to, and the bill was oidered to be engrossed
for a thud leading to day
CONGRESS OF NATIONS.
Mr LEGARE said, that, yesterday, in making
the report upon the memorial of certain citizens
of Massachusetts, praying for a congress of na-
tions for the ¡settlement of national disputes, he
had neglected to make the motion that the same
be printed He would beg leave now to make
that motion
Mr HOWARD suggested the following
amendment
For reasons stated m the report of the Committee on
Foreign Affnrs, made to the House on 1-ith June lbJ8 and
numbered nine hundred and seventy nine, m the printed
documents of tne second session of the Twenty Fifth Con
gress
Mr ADAMS suggested the propriety of amend-
ing the motion so as to include the memoual
which he presented last year, forming the basis
of this report, and also those piesented since
Thes.e memorialists seem to be well acquainted
with the report made by thegentleman at the last
session
Mr LEGARE had no objection to this amend-
ment
Mr ADAMS said he presumed the committee
had not looked into the memorial which discusses
the report made by that committee at the last ses
sion It was the most luminous of all piesent-
ed them He hoped the present report would be
recommitted to that committee to take into con-
sideration these memorials He had many upon
the same subject which had not yet been present-
ed, from enlightened citizens from vauous parts
of the Union
The SPEAKER decided that the motion to
print was a distinct one from that of the Commit-
tee on Foreign Affairs It would not, therefore,
oe in order to amend that motion by moving to
recommit the report, but a motion to recommit
anu print would be m order
Mr ADAMS so modified his motion
Some conversation took place between Messrs.
ADAMS and LEGARE in relation to the memo-
rials presented, and the report of the committee
of the last session upon this subject
Mr HOWARD said there were two classes of
memorials before the committee, one class relat-
ing to the creating of a congress of nations, to
settle national difficulties generally, and the other
asking the interposition of the United States be
tween the Republic of Mexico and the Trench
nation The latter class the committee now had
under consideration,and, hehoped, would be pre-
pared in a few days to make a report thereupon
The former, proposing a congress of nations, had
been fully considered and reported upon by that
committee at the last session No new matter on
the former point had been brought before them
in these memonals, which they did not touch
upon at that time, and it was for that reason that
the committee asked to be discharged from the
further consideration of the subject He had no
objection to vote for printing the memorial also
Mr H was understood to say that the report had
been founded upon one memorial
Mr ADAMS rejoined, that as this report had
been founded upon but one single memorial, he
considered it an additional reason why it should
be recommitted He considered the report made
by that committee at the last session, one of the
ablest that had ever been produced upon that sub-
ject, and would be willing to vote for printing one
million copies to disseminate among the people
Some furthei conversation heie took place
between Messrs LEGARE, CUSHING, and
ADAMS
Mr PFTRIKIN, having obtained the floor,
moved the previous question, but subsequently
withdrew it for an exj lanation from
Mr ADAMS, who said, as he felt himself
satisfied by the explanations of the gentlemen of
the committee, he would withdraw his motion to
lecommit, but insist on that to print the memo-
ual
Mr PETRIKIN here renewed his motion for
the previous question, which was seconded—
yeas 68, nays 57
The main question was then ordered—being
upon the motion of Mr Legvre to print the
leportof the Committee on Foieign Affairs,made
on yesterday—and decided in the affirmative

Mr Cambrelen&'s motion to raise a select com-
mittee to investigate the defalcations of Samuel
Swartwout, the question being on the motion to
strike from the modified resolution the proposi
tion to raise said committee by ballot
Mr DUNCAN addressed the House at some
length and having concluded his remarks,
Mr PETRIKIN obtained the floor,and moved
the pievious question
Mr GRENNELL moved a call of the House,
befoie taking the question, however,
Mr PETRIKIN withdiew the motion for the
previous question, at the solicitation of
Mr STANLY, who, having spoken some time
m reply to Mr Dlhcan, renewed the motion for
the pievious question
Mi WISE inquired what would be the effect
of the motion for the previous question, if it pre-
vailed' Would it cut off the amendment winch
proposed the appointment of the committee fay
ballot?
The SPEAKER leplied ¡n the affirmative
Mr WISE moved a call of the House
The question was taken by tellers, and there
appeared—ayes 91, noes 90
The SPE AKER voted against it, and conse-
quently it was lost
Mr. KENNEDY obtained the floor, and mo-red
that the House adjourn, upon which motion
Mr COFFIN demanded the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered
The question was taken, and there appeared—
yeas 14, nays 193
So the House refused to adjourn
Mr GARLAND, of Louisiana, renewed the
motion for a call of the House

Mi KENNEDY, being entitled to the floor,
proceeded to discuss, for a short time, the prop-
osition before the House, but waived his right
to admit a motion for adjournment
The question upon the motion to adjourn was
then taken, and decided in the negative—yeas 83,
nays US
Mr KENNEDY intimated a wish that the
House should come to a decision upon the sub-
ject before it, and to enable it to do so suspended
all further remarks
The question being on the proposition of Mr
Thomas, to strike from the amendment moved
by Mi Garland, of Virginia, the words " elect
by ballot," and insert the words " v%va voce,"
Mr FILLMORE thereon demanded the yeas
and navs
Mr SMITH inquired of theChair if the amend-
ment to the amendment would not, as involving
a change of the íules, require a majoiity of two
thuds for its adoption '
The SPEAKER was understood to say that,
if the amendment to the amendment required two
thirds, it would also lequire two thirds to adopt
the resolution He decided that it was competent
for a majority to amend the resolution, but as it
involved a change of the íules, it would require
a vote of two thirds to pass it, and cited piece-
dents of the House and paihamentary law to sus-
tain him in his decision
Mr WISE said he did not coincide with the
opinion of the Speaker, that the law did not sat-
isfy his mind He contended that it was not com-
petent for the Chair to entertain a motion which
was, in effect, to change and abrogate the rules
of the House, and stated his point of order to be
founded upon the rules of the House, in the fol-
lowing words
"All committees shall be appointed by the Speaker, tin
less otherwise specially directed by the House, in which
case they shah be appointed by ballot "
The SPEAKER decided that it was morder to
move the amendment, and that the point raised
might be " a fit ground for its rejection by that
House, but not within the competence of the
Speaker to suppress, as if it weie against order,"
that if the amendment to the amendment be agreed
to by a majority,and the amendment as amended
be incorporated into the resolution by a majority,
the resolution, m that form, would require, under
the 119th rule, which provides, " nor shall any
rule be suspended except by a vote of at least
two thirds ot the members present," a vote of
two thirds to pass the same
Mr WISE appealed from this decision of the
Chair, and demanded the yeas and nays upon
said appeal
Mr ELMORE suggested to the gentleman from
Virginia [Mr Wis*.] that this was not the time
to iait,e the question of order that it would be
much better to raise it upon the resolution itself,
and not on a preliminary motion
Mi WISE replied that it % as the proper time;
he wanted the House to determine whether if was
competent to entertain amotion that,m his opin-
ion, violated a rule of the House
Mr FILLMORE here read the rule of the
House, which, in substance, says that a propo-
sition to amend the íules should be submitted one
day pievious to the question on its action, and
gave it as his opinion that it was not in order to
entertain the motion to amend the resolution
Mi BANKS said he had risen for the purpose
of sustaining the decision of theChair,ana should
have prefened adhering to the course he had pre-
scnbed to himself in voting rather than m partici-
pating m the protracted and botindiess debates of
