THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

ingand unyielding, driven to despair, nothing to
hope from us, nothing to hope but in the suc-
cess of their cause. That is one policy.
General Sherman during the last year has made
the most brilliant campaign I think that history
records. From the time that he left Chattanooga
until he cartied his grand army to Savannah and
captured that city, 1 think there is nothing like it
in all modern history for the care that he took of
his men, for the skill with which he accomplished
every movement, not throwing, as Granthas done,
thousands of men against breastworks to die, but
by the interposition of high military genius he
has carried hisarmy in triumph over the mountains
and along the riveis until that army has marched
clear across the southern confederacy. I regret
that in a military point of view before he left At-
lanta he found it to be necessary to destroy that
city; but when he came to Savannah, and that was
at his feet, in the power of the General Govern-
ment, private property was respected and indi-
vidual security was made yet mote secure; and
what has been the effect? The effect of General
Sherman's wise and humane policy at and about
Savannah has made the power of Jeff. Davis and
the southern confederacy tremble through all the
Empire State of the South. Senators know it.
Ami in my action and votes here 1 am going to
consult what I believe, with the best lights I can
command, to bo the true interestand honor of my
country, and not one minute shall I consult the
passions of the day. I want this Union lestored,
not of one people to hate another; i want it re-
stored under such circumstences that we may once
more be fi lends.
Why is it that according to the laws of nations
certain rules have been adopted for the regulation
of belligerents, between foieign Powers engaged
in war? It is that the war shall be prosecuted
without inhumanity, barbarism, and ciuelty, so
that when the war is over there may be mutual
respect and confidence, that the ancient relations
of commerce and trade may return unimpaired.
If that is an argument m favor of standing far the
laws of nations, that high code which civilization
has established between foreign Powers, belliger-
ents, is it not a much more potent aigument in
favor of standing by those sentiments when we
wish to bring back into the family these people of
the South, and make us once more one Govern-
ment and one people with one destiny J
Mr. HENDERSON. I move that the Senate

wish to have the amendment that 1 moved, and
also the amendment of my colleague, ordered to

The VICE PRESIDENT. That order will
be made if there be no objection. The question
is on the motion of the Senator from Missouri.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate

PRINTING OV DOCUMENTS.
Mr. A. W. CLARK. I am also instructed by
the Committee on Printing to report the following
resolutions, and 1 ask that they be passed at this
time:
Resoh ed, That the outers made by the House of Repre-
sentative* duiing the fir^t session ot the picsent Congress
for punting the account's of the superintendent of Indian .
affairs for the southern superintendeney be, and the s$me
are hereby, rescinded.
Resolved, That the order made by the House of Repre-
sentatives, on thu 12th of February, 1864, for printing the
statement of fines imposed and deductions made from the
pay of contractors lor carrying the mails during tfce year
ending June 30,1863,be,and the same is hereby,repealed.
Resolved, That similar reports hereafter made to the
House, shall not be printed unless special directions be
given therefor.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Is that a
House resolution or a joint resolution?
Mr. A. W. CLARIt. The order for printing
was made by the House.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I supposed
that this statement of fines was printed under a
provision of law.
Mr. A. W. CLARK. It was ordered to be
printed by the House.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I supposed
there was a provision of law which required these
things to be printed. 1 think the resolution is
just and proper. The only question is whether
it should not be a joint resolution, in order to
repeal an existing law on the subject.
Mr. A. W. CLARK. No, sir; it was merely
an order of the House.
The resolutions were then agreed to.
LANMAN's DICTIONARY OF CONGRESS.
Mr. A. W. CLARK. I am also instructed by
the majority of the Committee on Printing to re-
port the resolution which I send to the Chair.
Permit me to say that I dissent from the report, but
make it under the instructions of the committee.
The resolution was read, as follows:
Resolved, That there be printed for the use of the mem-
bers of this llou-e a fcufheient numbei of extia copies of
the Dictionary of Congie-s to make the quota of the House
equal to that already oideied by the Senate : Provided, The
cop) right hereby direeted lo be paid by the Clerk shall not
exceed the amount heretofore paid per copy for thu same
work.
Mr. KERNAN. I desire to inquire thecostof
printing those extra copies.
Mr. A. W. CLARK. Anticipating that this
resolution might elicit some debate, I took the
precaution to ask the Public Printer the expense
of the contemplated work. Accoiding to this res-
olution, each member of this House would be
furnished with an additional'supply of twenty-
three copiesof this Dictionary, the wholeexpenso
of which, according to the estimate of the Public
Printer, would amount to 1,250, $5,000 of which
would go as copyright lo Mr. Lunman. He,
however, in a letter to me, says that if the type
which has been set up has already been distrib-
uted, he proposes to receive fifty cents per copy
as his compensation for the copyright, reducing
the amount to $2,500. A majouty of the commit-
tee were m favor of the report, but were unani-
mous in eaying that the expense for copyright
should not exceed fifty cents for each copy.
1 now call the previous question.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I move that the res-
oluiion be laid on the table.
Mr. SCHENCIC. This is one of the worst
of all the jobs that have ever been brought into
this House.
The SPEAKER. The previous question has
been called, and debate is not in order.
Mr. A. W. CLARK. If the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Sciiekck] wishes to make some re-
marks on this subject, I withdraw the call for
the previous question.
Mr. SCMENCK. Mr. Speaker, this is one of
those resolutions for book purchasing and book
distributing at the expense of the Government
winch 1 think ought not to pass. It is proposed
to buy, for the use of members of this House and
for distribution, a book which, if it has any merit,
belongs to that class that ought to be obtained by
application at the bookstores in the usual way
by those who have occasion for it. I would as
soon think of distributing any other Dictionary
as a Dictionary of Congress, which, I believe, is
simply intended to give a brief biography, not
only of every honorable gentleman here now, but
of all those who at any time heretofore have served
in the legislative councils of the nation. It seems
to me that it ought to be enough to defeat a res-
olution of this kind to refer to the fact that it is
a book whose general character is such that mem-
bers and their constituents ought to supply it to
themselves, if they are curious in that kind of
literature, without putting the public to the ex-
pense of purchasing it for them.
