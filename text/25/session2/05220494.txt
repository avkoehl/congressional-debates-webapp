THE LATE DUEL
Mi PRENTISS of Mississippi rose, he said at the request of
the paities implu ated, and also from his own sense ol the pio
pnety and mipoitance of the subject, notwithstanding the late
period of the session, to call the attention ol the House to the
duelling leport As a question of privilege, he believed he had
a right to submit a motion m relation ton at <my ime, and he
should move to take it up He did so from the fact that mem
beis ot that House were deeply implicated, and the House ought
not toadjomn with such an indictment, or inquest, or verdict,
with judgment pronounced, impending over the heads of those
gentlemen    Mr P then submitted his motion
Mr GRANTLAND would inform the gentleman that if his
object was to get a vote upon the resolutions, Mr G believed he
could easily attun it
The CHAIR would enteitim the motion as a privileged
question, but it was still in the power of the House to decide
whether they would t ike it up or not
Mr GRAY inquired if it would be in order to move to la>

Mr WiSE    I never expected justice in this mattei I—
'Ihe CHAIR appealed to the gentleman from "Vilgima the

Mr WISE made a íequest to the House, and asked Mi
Adams to give wiy for the purpose, to do him the justice to
punt the evidence in that infamous duel, or rather the infamous
evidence ol the duel case
Mr ADAMS did not giv-e way, because after wnat fell fiom
the chairman of the Committee on Foreign Affaus yesteiday,
he could not do so
