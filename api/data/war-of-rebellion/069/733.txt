HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 10, 1864.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

A battalion of the Thirty-eighth Wisconsin Volunteers, numbering about 280 men, have reported here and been assigned to your corps. The battalion consists of four companies and is commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Pier. The commanding general directs me to inquire whether this accession will enable you to spare the small regular infantry force you have with you.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 10, 1864-11.45 a.m.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch in reference to the Wisconsin regiment received. When I spoke to General Meade yesterday about transferring the regulars of our corps to General Ayres' division, I was under the impression that they desired to join that division. These regiments learned yesterday that such movements were in contemplation, and last evening sent to me a unanimous request from their officers to remain with the Ninth Corps. Whilst I am not in the habit of regarding such petitions, I hope that in this case it may be regarded, and that both regiments, which number less than 300 both together, may be allowed to remain with the corps.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 10, 1864-8 p.m.

The division officer of the day reports that a force of the enemy's cavalry attacked our cavalry picket on our extreme right, near the Allen house this afternoon, capturing nearly a whole company. Should anything more definite than this report come in, it will be forwarded at once.
