all doubt as to the latter, we not only incited to
litigation and expense, but opened a door to the
entire loss of all that ineome till new legislation
took place But we might take from the manufac
hirer all incidental protection, even to 20 per cent;
and we might reduce the value of all goods on hand
with merchants, to quite the extent oS that twenty
per cent If all was free from this time forward,
(as several gentlemen had seriously contended on
the other side,) such must be the great and unex-
pected consequence. Time, then, was every thing
in action on v. a day's unnecessary delay might
cau«e deplorable difficulties
The second bill endeavored to cut, if it did not
untie, the Gordian knot as to home valuatif n It
could be acted on with more leisure, as the first bill
removed the effects of doubts for th<: pre ent But
the home valuation we were bound, under the com-
promise act, to provide for. We had not yet done
it since 1833 There should be express legislation
by Congress., and never too much left to Execu-
tive discretion. This bill did it- it did it, sito, in
such a marner as to make the dutn s uniform, and
it came, he believed, as near ihe real home value
as any rule, more flexible, expensive, aad uncer-
tain, would be likely to introduce
It accorded, too, with the habits of the country
and the custom house most of the time during the
last half century, in adding a certain fixed per
centage to the foreign value, before the ad valorem
duties were assessed here.
This billcouldbe maturely considered and amend-
ed, if objectionable But he did not believe that
any other system to settle the value here would
ever be agreed on
His object in both was practical He acted, in
offering them, on hit, own impulses of duty, con
sidenng the present a arming condition of the
finances. H« did not move on the sub] ct till all
was mjeopardv, as the duty was officially now m
o'her hands He now meant nothing beyond what
the bill-, and he himself sad, and ihe r fate was
with the Senate Bm he smceielv trusted that,
ifthe>e bills did not succeed, those who otjected
would speedily offer and catry 'om' b ng better,
in order to obv ate some of the dangprs and disas-
ters which they, even more than he, believed to
hang over the country and its future destinies.
The b IK were then read, as follows.

Mr. HUNTINGTON said the question of leave
to introduce tbe bi'l involved a question of some
moment The bi'l extendrg the revenue laws
was of great importance It proposed to extend
the existing law, except that the rale of dut es to
be collected under it shall noi exceed 20 pet cent
Mr. H contenJed that this vas a revenue bill, to
all intents and purposes and cuid not, as such,
be originated in the Sena e, the Constitution con-
fining such a right to the House of Representat ves
It was a bill to laiseminey for the sjpport of Gov
ernment Though it vas a bill to extend an ex-
isting law, jet it proposed to modify that law, and
it was the '•ame, in us legal effect, as if it were an
original bill levying duties.    The Senate had, pn
CÓN&ftES&ÓNAt GLOM.
I one occasion, gone so far as to rule a bill to i>sue
treasury notrs cut of nrder, on the ground that it
was virtually a revenue bill—the object being to
raise revenue—and should have originated in the
House of Representatives. Wow, if that was a
true and practical construction of the Constitution,
certainly this bill, which goes to fix a rate of duties
and to raise revenue for the support of Govern-
ment, could not be originated in the Senate. It was
to continue existing laws, und was, therefore, a bill
to raise money. But it was, in hisopmun, and
he had so expressed himself heretofore, that after the
30th June here would be no revenue laws; and the
same ground hid been taken by other Senators on
thatside, (ihe Whig side,) tb.Pt on this very day there
was no law by which one cent of revenue o uld be
collected if we have no power, by exist ng law,
to coll'ct dutie , then this was a bill not merely to
extend an existing law, but to raise revenue by the
impo ition of new duties Such, he maintained,
was its effect, and should therefore originate in the
House.
He was aware of the condition in which the
country was placed, and particularly the manufac
tormg interests His eyes wtre net closed to the
interests of those whom he represented He sta-
ted, «ome time since—when the tariff bill, which is
vptoed, was under consideration—the necessity for
its passage, to guard the revenues of the country,
and the mannfa"tunng interes's Where are we
now on this question? and who is responsible for
the deplorab estate of things? Is it Congress, or
another department of the Government? On this
incidental question, he would not discuss 'hat point,
but he would only say that, if duties cnnlJ not be
co'lec ed, the fau t did noi he at their door It was
said by the Ptesidtnt, m the veto menage, that he
was advised that duties could be collected under
the law of 1833. Whether it was the Seere'ary
of the Treasury (who, in his reportrn the finances,
s^id mat no dunes could be col'ec'ed under existing
laws) who advised him, he did not knew, or
whe her it was a great legal mind of the Cabinet,
or elsewhere, be did not care But he would
say, lna> whoever exp"1 s- d such an opin-
ion would fifd tbat, when th  qu stion cirne
before the judicial tribunes as it we uld, then 
would be but one opinion—'run no revenue could
he collec'ed on the importations subsequent to the
30 h of June, without new les sla'ion Mr H.
then made s me remarks on the tariff lu^s or 1832,
the piovisions of which, as to the mode of assess-
ing ih" dut es, were, he «aid, repea'ed by the law
of 1833, which law, after the 30 h of June, pro-
vided fcr a 1 oinc valuation Tnough it repealed
the mode of assessing du 'e«, it did not undertak-
to fix a substitute for that mole, leaving if open to
subsequent 'egislalion
[Mr Buchanan (m an undertone ) You Wh.gs
have a majority in both Hruses—why have jou
not legisl ited long since, and fixed ihe principle of
assessing duties under the home valuation']
Mr H then re erred to the debatas and pro-
ceedings on thf compromise set, and quoted copi-
ous extracts from them, to show thai the neht
was pnsitivtl" dpmed to the Pre^'dent and Secie
tary of the Treasury to make anv rule, after the
30 h of June, to cirry out the pr neiple of home
valuation, but that act left the details, to eff ct
that S5 stem, to the suosequent legisla ion of Con-
gress
Mr WOODBURY did notcon'ider the bids row
ofterel ?s bills to ra s-> revenue—enhrr by mcreas-
lrg duties, or cnnti- mi g laws hereto'ore in force,
authonnng higher dut p? than now collectable,
therefore, he did not s e how they cojld he viewed
as measures not coming within the province of the
S^nat  to orginate. His object was lo retain du-
i es as th' y no  arc—?t 20 per cent, according to
the compromise act, but to apply to its collec ion
the machine!y of the reienue la -i of 1832 That
object was certainly not beyond the cons'itutional
power oí the Sena'e to originate. He admitted,
however, tb*t if, n reality, po duties could be col
lee'ed under existing laws, it would not be cotrpe-
tent for the Senate to originate bills which noud
eff ct the collection Such, however, he a^umed,
was not the case. But, as long as it was believed
by those who had to pay duties, or asserted in Con-

gress, that there was a doubt on the subject, it was    ¡
competent for the Senate to originate a declaratory    |
measure setting aside such doubts.                              |
Mr. EVANS observed that he was very well    \
aware of the importance of the subject brought to    I
the notice of the Senate by the honorable Senator
from New Hampshire, and that it was necessary    i
there should be some speedy legislative action m    |
relation to it   But it seemed to him at least doubt-    j
ful whether that action could properly arise in the    1
Senate    He would, however, he confessed, feel    1
disposed to strain a point on an occasion «o urgent,    1
to ascertain whether it is possible for the Stnate fo    |
en'er upon the subject without violation of Ihe role    !
laid down by the Constitution, fully impressed with    s
the conviction that the best interests of the c ontry    j
demanded  immediate  action     He should not,    ■
theretore, object to  the introduction of the two    l
bills   proposed by the honorable   Senator,  even    w
though he had strong doubts that the Senate could    «
originate such measures    These doubts rested on    ,
the fact, lhat the intention and object of the bills
are evidently to rar-e revenue for the trea ury, or,    ,
in other words, the effect of which will be to bring    :
into the treasury money fiom duties—measures for    >
which, it is the province of the Housp of Represent-    S
auves  to  originate.    Now, if the question  was,
whether such would be  the eff-ct of the bills, he   j
could not see any objection to entering upon it at   *
once     But if the law , as they stand at prpsent,    !J
ctnnot be made available for supplying the treas-    *
ury—and   if, by  ihese bills, that dtfect can  be    "
remed ed, and those laws can, by their means, be    J
not only made efficient,  but placed on a moresta-    *
ble foun lation —heconeeived the very effect thus to    '
be produced, would be «uch as t>  throw doubt on    *
the con  uutional power of the Senate to originate    '
them, inasmuch as that effect must be to place in    *
the treasury mean  which it would not have but    !
for them      If ihe argument was well grounded,    a
that no revenue could be collected by the laws as    !
they now s-land, there could not be a doubt that it    *
would not be competent for the Senate to entertain    s
the initiation  of these bills.    Indeed, the Sena'or    *
from N"w Hampsbire,   himself, candidly admits    *
that      In   any    a pect   cf   ihe   case,   perhaps    S
it   might    be   said   that   such   would   be   the    *
effect   of these   bills;   for   the  honorable   Sen-    s
ator proposes to   retain   the machinery   of   the   tl
law of 1832,   and  that machinery   contairjs the    n
ad valorem principle, which  the law of 1833 ('he    ®
compromise act) says shall be changed on the 1st   g
July, 1842    The law of 1833 was to supersede   ¡j,
the law of 1833, but it is now proposed to restore the    ¡g
machinery of ihe superseded law. and was not tbat   j
law and its machireiy for raising revenue?—an ob-    j
jrot which the Constitution sa>s shall originate in the   \¡
House of Representatives.    It is said, indeed, that   ¡¡¡
although the object is to mt ke use of that machi-   ¡|
nery, it is only temporary, and until otherwise   %
ordered by Congress, and,  instead of increasing   j
revenue, it is to provide that not more than 20 per    ^
cent, sha 1 be raised for the time—a rate infinitely   ^
below the rate allowed by ths law of 1832     He   ^
apprehended there was a mi conception of the im-   ^
port of the restr etion in the Const tution as to the   ^
originating of revenue bills in  the Senate     The   i(
word in the Constitution is not ' increasing" reve-   ¡ 
nue, but "rais.ng" revenue   and this applied to 20   ia
per cent , or any rate of per cent, no matter how   j(
small.    The meaning  is, that  all b lis providing   ^
money for the Government shall ortg nate m the   ,s
other  House—any bill  the intent and   object of   !&
which  is  to place revenue in the treasury, which   ,^
would not, but for it, be there     Now, if these bills   ,.
have anv obj°ct at all, it must be that, and if they   t
have  not  tnat object, th y ire unnecessary     But   ¿*
the  eviden'—an!, he fe t bound  to say, the very   *
laudable—intention of the honorable "Senator from   *
New Hampshi e, is to rbtam by means of these   J
bills, and pay into the tieasury, the revenue of the   "«
country, winch it is feared the preser t laws cannot   *l
ecure the collection of.                                             ^"
And if the views of the Executive, as expressed    *
in his ^eto message, as  he (Mr  E ) understood   3
them, be correct,  the Government can and will    *
collect the revenue authorized by the compromise    *
act, under exis'ing laws; therefore, these bills are   J*
unnecessary.   If thes  views, however, are not   J*
