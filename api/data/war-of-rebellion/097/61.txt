RICHMOND, March 12, 1865.

The Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Washington:

SIR: In addition to what I communicated to your Department this forenoon, I beg to state that it was through the influence of the Government I obtained my present situation, and if it were known here that I had given any information to the Government at Washington, without first reporting to our Government, I might be in danger of losing my situation here; therefore I again request secrecy till I have communicated all the details, with proofs, to your accredited agent. The ramifications of the conspiracy have any conception of .

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

D. CAMBELL McNAB.

CITY POINT, VA., March 21, 1865-2.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I would recommend relieving Crook from command of his department and ordering him to command the cavalry of the Army of the Potomac. I would call attention to the fact that our white troops are being paid, whilst the colored troops are not. If paymaster could be ordered here immediately to commence paying them it would have a fine effect.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, March 21, 1865-10 p.m .

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have ordered General Crook to be relieved and report to you for assignment to command, and have directed paymasters to be sent down to pay the colored troops. The reason for the difference was that at the request of the Secretary of the Treasury the troops were ordered to be paid by corps in their numerical order. We have not money to pay all at once, but can pay them progressively.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, March 21, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel U. S. GRANT,

General-in-Chief, City Point, Va.:

General Crook is now at Cumberland, and has received the order announcing his exchange and directing him to assume command of his department.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
