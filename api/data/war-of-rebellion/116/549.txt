Colonel Lee of your Army procured a parole for Colonel Baldwin, a prisoner in this fort, to go to Richmond and effect their exchange and the exchange was made.

Hoping that you will procure me a parole for the purpose above expressed and to hear from you soon,

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
