HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Macon, Ga., April 29, 1865.

COMMANDING GENERAL U. S. FORCES IN TENNESSEE:

GENERAL: This communication will be delivered to you by Lieutenant Heywood, of my staff. In pursuance of instructions from General Sherman I have sent him to Tennessee for the purpose of making the necessary arrangements for opening the Atlanta and Dalton Railroad. He will give all requisite information in regard to the present condition of the road and what will be needed to put it in good order, convinced that if we are to remain in Georgia a line of supplies should be opened at once, for it will be with great difficulty that even two months' supply of forage, meat, and bread can be purchased in this State for my command. We are beginning to need small stores and clothing already. Please have operations begin at once, with as heavy force as possible at Dalton, and push forward the repairs. I will arrange for beginning the work at this end of the line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

GENERAL: This will be handed you by Lieutenant Heywood, of my staff, whom I am sending, accompanied by a small party under flag of truce, to Dalton for the purpose of making arrangements to open the railroad from that place to Atlanta. Please do what you can consistently to forward Lieutenant Heywood. Having done everything in my power to relieve the people of military restrictions during the armistice, I have to request that you will allow my mail messengers and others not engaged in acts violative of the armistice to pass without detention or molestation.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
