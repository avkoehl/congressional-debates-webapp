The Tariff—Mr. Brooks.
Ho. of Beps.
I understand liini—if so much is to be given
to iron and coal, and so much to cotton and
woolen, so much is due to flax. But I sub-
mit to my honorable friend he is asking for
more than his share in the spoils, in the gen-
eral despoliation of the consumers. The in-
creased duty he demands in his bill on hackled
flax is from $15 now, to $40 per ton, equal to
167 per eent. The increase of duty on flax is
33 per cent. A ton of flax straw is three fourths
woody material, which is worthless for any pur-
pose; so the dutyonaquarterofaton of flax in
the straw is $20, or equal to $80 per ton before
the flax is separated from the woody material,
and this makes an increase of 433 per eent. The
increase of the duty on tow, from $5 to $10 is 100
per cent. Now, I submit this is more than my
honorable colleague on the committee [Mr.
Kelley] asks for on iron, or my other honor-
able colleagues, [Mr. McCarty,] on salt, or
[Mr. Blair] on copper and timber, or [Mr.
Hooper] on cottons or woolens, mixed, ad
valorem, or by the pound. And my honorable
friend must not make the mistake on flax that
my other honorable colleagues made on wool,
woolens, and copper, for fine Dutch flax is as
indispensable to work in with American flax to
give it quality as foreign wool is to work with
American wool, or foreign copper with Amer-
ican copper.
The great cotton-growing interest of the
South, to say nothing of the great grain-grow-
ing interest of California and Oregon, which
sends its grain to market in bags, had some
right to expect from the Ways and Means Com-
mittee, especially after our explorations on the
Willamette and Columbia rivers and on the
rivers of California, some relief from the three
and four cents per pound tax on gunny-cloth,
gunny-bags, and cotton bagging—a return at
least to the old peace duties—but they have
none in this bill.
The fact is that before we in this country
began to manufacture cotton bagging flax was
grown for its seed alone, atid the flax itself, or
tow, was burned. This fact is stated in the me-
morial just presented to Congress by the " flax
growers' and manufacturers' convention" held
in Cleveland, January 2G, 1870. It would seem
then that the flax growers required no more
protection, for they themselves admit that they
never did so well as they aro now doing, for
the stuff they formerly burned as worthless
they now sell to makers of bagging at a full
price.
Of the bagging made in this country about
one half is made in the South and West, from
flax tow, and one half in New York, from jute
and butts. It is generally conceded, by per-
sons in the business, that the western (or flax
tow) manufacturers have done much better than
the eastern (or jute and butts) manufacturers,
and it would, therefore, ssem that the flax
manufacturers required no more protection.
Now, the duty proposed in this bill, on gunny-
cloth, cotton bagging, and gunny bagging, of 3
and 4 cents per pound, is within a fraction of
100 per cent, of their market value in bond, and
threatens prohibition from abroad, and hence
no competition at home. I call the attention
of the southern members of this House to an
analysis of the real tax in this bill.
On heavy bagging, weighing one pound per
yard and costing G cents per yard, the duty
will be 3 cents, or 50 per cent. On the same
goods, weighing one and a half pound per yard
and costing 8 cents, the duty would be 4 J cents,
or 5(5 per cent. On light bagging, costing 4
cents per yard, of 8 ounces, the duty would be
37 J per cent. The proposed duty is from 07 j
to 60 per cent.
True statesmanship now, in a country like
ours, exporting nearly 3,000.000 of bales of cot-
ton and millions ofbushelsof grain, soitseems
to me, should let in the raw material of bagging
free, and thereby encourage as much as possible
the manufacture of bagging here, and gunny
bagging, which is enough to protect the hemp,
the flax, and tow of the West, while the healtliy
competition of the manufacture of the foreign
raw material and ofthe domestic material would
be of great benefit to the grain-growers aud
cotton-growers, and the ship-owners freighting
the heavy raw material from the East. Com-
petition already has done much. While we
have been making better bagging at home
under that competition, the manufacturers iu
India have been improving too; and hence the
heavy insurance on cotton has been, and is
coming down, to the benefit of the cotton-
growers, from 3\ to 4 in 1866 to 75 to 00 in
1869, the rate of general merchandise, how-
ever, with no discrimination against it in con-
sequencc of the poor quality of the bagging.
short tariff—long revenue.
But, Mr. Chairman, I must not consume
more time on details; the bill might employ
me for hours upon its incongruities and injus-
tice. It is my duty to propose or suggest the
means of raising revenue, as well as to scold
the means proposed. Hence I suggest a pro-
ject something like this: to raise $148,000,000
in gold, enough, more than enough, however,
on some twenty-five or thirty articles, in lieu of
the four or five thousand articles in our tariff
now.

mockery on the laboring man.
This is a projet which will raise a sufficiency
of revenue to create a sinking fund to pay off'
the public debt of the country and to provide
for all the necessary expenditures of the Gov-
ernment, while it will better protect the labor
and the laboring man of the country than the
existing high bounty system, which now makes
this the dearest country in the world for the
laboring man to live in now; mocking him
with high wages but tantalizing him with dear
rents, dear food, dear clothes, dear boots and
shoes, dear everything. The tax on man here
is unlike anything iu the civilized world, a tax
such as the Turk would hardly stand from the
Sultan, or the fellah of Egypt fromthe pasba-in- :
chief or the pasha with never so many tails. Did
you ever, Mr. Chairman, think overplus tax
on man? Did you ever analyze or dissect it ?
Let us do it.

taxes upon knowledge.
Sir, the book-makers of the country have
come here and demanded that we shall impose
a duty of 25 cents per pound on imported
books. I do not blame them for making this
application, rough as it seems, and I think it
ought to be heeded, provided we continue the
present rates of taxationupon them, for we owe
to the book-makers of the country equity in
protection, as it is called, and equal and exact
justice. I hold in my hand a statement of the
American book-publishers, in which they show
that they pay forty different taxes to the United
