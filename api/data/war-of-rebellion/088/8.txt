GENERAL: On account of my small infantry force I did not intend to post new batteries on the line. I have two in reserve that I can send in when I send in my infantry reserves. I calculate I shall have time for that. I informed your staff officer last night that I did not want batteries in position along the line, and that yours could be withdrawn at any time.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

The Second Division is encamped in the wood between the Southall house and Norfolk railroad. The other divisions occupy their old camp.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
