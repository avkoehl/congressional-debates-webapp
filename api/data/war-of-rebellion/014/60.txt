It is designed to relieve General Hooker by one regiment, say 850 men, leaving, with some 500 cavalry, 1,350 men on the Lower Potomac.

To recapitulate:

Men.

At Warrenton there are to be............................ 7,780

At Manassas, say........................................ 10,859

In the valley of the Shenandoah......................... 35,467

On the Lower Potomac.................................... 1,350

In all.................................................. 55,456

There would thus be left for the garrisons and the front of Washington under General Wadsworth some 18,000 men, exclusive of the batteries under instruction.

The troops organizing or ready for service in New York I learn will probably number more than 4,000. These should be assembled at Washington, subject to disposition where their services may be most needed.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
