Captain McENTEE,

Deserters from Archer, Lane, and Scales came in last evening. It is almost positive there has been no movement in Hill's corps up to 11 o'clock last evening. These men left the trenches and no marching orders had been given at that hour.

Provost-Marshal-General's Department, City Point:

Be very careful about reporting any part of Hill's corps or Johnson's division as having gone south unless you have later information than last Thursday. Deserters from Heth, Mahone, Wilcox, and Johnson yesterday, and other information very conclusive that no force has left our front.
