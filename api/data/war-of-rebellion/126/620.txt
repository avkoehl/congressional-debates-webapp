legality, were laid before the Solicitor of the War Department in April, 1864, and were noticed by him as follows:*

As soon as the pressure of business permitted, the correction of the enrollment was resumed under orders dated June 25, 1864, which were slightly modified and republished on the 15th of in the following terms:+

At the time these instructions were issued the draft of 1863, under the original enrollment, had been completed, and the draft which began May 1, 1864, for deficiencies in all calls prior to an including that of March 14, 1864, was nearly closed. These drafts had begun to make it apparent to the people that it was certainly for theh town, ward, &amp;c., to have correct lists, to the end, first, that each locality might be called upon for no more than a fair share of all the troops to be raised, and, secondly, that all who were properly liable should be so recorded, in order not to increase unduly the chances to be drafted of those whose names were already on the lists. But besides this, when the fairness of this method of raising troops became properly understood, and the necessity of its opposition which had interfered with former efforts subsided and gradually disappeared. In many instances it was even replaced by activity and zeal on the part of committees and individuals in pointing out errors and furnishing data for corrections. Hence the lists were rapidly corrected, and when the business of the Bureau was practically stopped in April, 1865, the enrollment was as nearly correct as it can well be made under existing laws.

Between July 1, 1864, and April 30, 1865, 461,073 names were added to the enrollment lists, and 1,231,439 names stricken off.

The enrollment shows the national forces not called out to have consisted of 2,245,063 men on the 30th day of April, 1865. This does not include the 1,000,516 men in the field on the 30th day of April, 1865.#

Careful estimates and calculations, based upon the best data to be obtained, lead to the conclusion that notwithstanding the losses during the war, there were more men in the loyal States properly subject to the call of the Government for military service at the close of the rebellion than at its beginning. Moreover, in estimating the military strength of the Government when hostilities ceased, the fact should be borne in mops, colored and white, raised in States in rebellion and the sources from which more such old have been supplied, are not considered, no enrollment of the national forces having been made in those States.

Remarks on the subject of enrollment and the proper basis for an equitable distribution of the burden of military service.

The origi the enrollment to be composed of two classes; The first, comprising all persons subject to do military duty between the ages of twenty and thirty-five years and all unmarried persons subject to military duty above the age of thirty-five and under the age of forty-five; the second class, comprising all other persons
