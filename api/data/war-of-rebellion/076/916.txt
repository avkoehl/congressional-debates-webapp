Lieutenant-General LEE:

As soon as relieved by General Hardee, General Hood directs that you move Brown's and Clayton's divisions to the left, under cover, so that the movement may not be observed by the enemy. Let these divisions rest in rear of the line between the Peach Tree and Marietta roads, and be in readiness to move at any moment. Supply them with sixty rounds of ammunition, if practicable. After making these dispositions please report in person to these headquarters.

F. A. SHOUP.

P. S.-That part of Stevenson's division to the left of the Peach Tree road will not be withdrawn. Your left will rest near the Marietta road.
