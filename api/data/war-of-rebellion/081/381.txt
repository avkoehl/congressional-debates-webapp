General HUMPHREYS:

I suppose that the major-general commanding is aware that I will not have troops enough to make a continuous line if General Wright has moved two miles and a half to the front. As yet General Russell has not moved from his position, or advanced his pickets, so far so as I know. I have telegraphed General Wright for information.

Your dispatch received. It was General Wright's picket-line that had moved two miles and a half to the front of his line of last night. He is directed to maintain his connection with you in charging forward.

A. A. HUMPHREYS.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
