I have found General Ferrero's application. It was with some papers that came in yesterday afternoon. The package was opened by Major Burstow and I neglected to look over his papers when searching for the application. I will send over immediately the order for General Ferrero. He can readily reach the mail boat at City Point before 10 a. m. You can send word to General Ferrero that the order is on the way to him.

General WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have nothing especial to report. There was the usual amount of firing. We strengthened our front last night by more abatis. The mine is now ready for the reception of the magazines. It is desirable that they should not go in till we are ready to explode, that the charge may not suffer from dampness.
