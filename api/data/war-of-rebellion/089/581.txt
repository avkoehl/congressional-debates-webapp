DIVISION OFFICER OF THE DAY:

CAPTAIN: You will please have the necessary instructions given at once to the picket-line to forward immediately any deserter. See that unusual vigilance is observed by the pickets.

By command of Brigadier-General Devens:

G. A. BRUCE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. PROVISIONAL DIVISION, ARMY OF THE JAMES,In the Field. November 9, 1864.

Captain ISRAEL R. SEALY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have ordered the detail required by Major-General Terry, but I consider it my duty to say that the force under my command cannot stand it. The details for picket and other service are already so heavy that the men have no time for drill; besides the recent rain shave so weakened the works in front that I have made requisition for tools to put them in order, and when supplied it was my intention to put all the men who could be spared at work upon them.

CHARLES K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON CITY, November 10, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Orders have been made requiring the immediate return of all troops to the field, and the utmost diligence of the Department will be directed to the object. General Dix reports that all of Butler's troops, except 500 regular, can return. A copy of his dispatch* is given. Before ordering Butler back, I will a day until the New York election is more definitely ascertained.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, November 10, 1864-10.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

Enough now seems to be known to say who is to hold the reins of Government for the next four years. Congratulate the President for me for the double victory. The election having passed of quietly, no bloodshed or riot throughout the land, is a victory worth more to the country than a battle won. Rebeldom and Europe will so construe it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
