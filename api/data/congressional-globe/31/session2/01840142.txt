THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dec. 31,
tions. It has met and triumphed over all adverse
influences, and placed the Post Office Department in
a more prosperous position than it ever occupied
before. Since the passage of the law of 1845, our
mail routes hare increased more than thirty-three
thousand miles; our annual transportation has in-
creased more than eleven millions of miles; more
than fire thousand new post offices have been es-
tablished; and, notwithstanding, there is now a
balance to the credit of the Department of more
than a million of dollars. If we will now adopt
the true revenue measure, and settle at once, with-
out delay and without hesitation, upon two cents
a letter for all distances, the trial of less than four
years will demonstrate the wisdom and the practi-
cability of the position I advocate. From sixty
millions of letters passing through our Post Office
annually, we should have one hundred millions,
one hundred and fifty millions, two hundred mil-
lions, three hundred millions,and soon cheap post-
age would give a greater revenue to the Post Office
than it now yields us.
The franking power, (I will not call it the frank-
ing privilege; it is a burden, not a privilege* to
members of Congress, inasmuch as it causes them
an expenditure of time and labor and treasure,
tenfold greater than it saves them,) I say the frank-
ing power now abstracts from the postal revenue
a million of dollars a year. This power should
be entirely abolished. We must have documents
published—large documents in large numbers—
and they must be circulated through the mail. But
the expense of the circulation should be provided
for as you provide for the support of the Army
and Navy. In this I concur heartily with the hon-
orable gentleman from North Carolina, [Mr. Ven-
able.] .All I claim is, that the expense of circu-
lating public documents shall not be made a tax
upon letter correspondence. In England no person
has the franking power. Even the Queen pays
postage like an honest woman. If we will abolish
In this connection I wish to present an official
statement of the net revenue arising from postage
under the existing law, and of the amount cred-
ited contractors for the transportation of the mails
in the several States and Territories, for the fis-
cal year ending 30th June, 1850. It is from
the Sixth Auditor's Office, Post Office Department,
December 11, 1850.

Mr. Chairman, I will not disguise my strong
anxiety to pass this postage bill, amended, as now
proposed, and to pass it without delay—to pass it
this very day—this last day of this eventful year;
this last day of the Jirst half of this nineteenth
century. Should the bill pass to-day, and the
States and Territories.

this franking power, and furnish to the people of
this Republic the same postal facilities that Victo-
ria and her subjects enjoy, the results witnessed in
England would be soon enjoyed in the United
States. The number of letters will increase here
in a pore rapid ratio than it has there. Educa-
tion is more extensively diffused here; our people
are more migratory, more social, more inquisitive,
more enterprising. They are spreading themselves
from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from the
Northern Lakes to the Gulf of Mexico; and they
are carrying with them the love of home and of
those whom they leave at home; with whom they
will delight to confer often, and the more fre-
quently, the cheaper your law makes the corre-
spondence. Two cents a letter is the highest reve-
nue point. Two cents a letter will encourage pro-
duction and yield a larger income than a higher
rate. Ultimate and complete success will crown
the measure, if adopted. The common objection
of many is, that the system which has proved so
successful in England, cannot prove successful
here, because of our great extent of territory.
Are gentlemen acquainted with the fact that the
difference in the cost of the transportation of the
mails in this country and England is less than
$300,000 ?—a sum less than one third of a cent
upon the present number of paying letters in this
eountry.
Again: I urge this measure because it conforms
to the original design of the Post Office Depart-
ment. What was the original design of this De-
partment? Was it revenue, or was it the diffu-
sion of knowledge, and the furtherance of the
highest interests of the Republic.' Let the fathers
answer, The authors of the Federalist, in their
Boble plan for the establishment of the Post Office,
say: " Nothing which tends to facilitate inter-
course between the States can be deemed unwor-
thy of the public care." In adjusting this postal
measure, it well becomes us to take heed to these
first principles, and to adopt such rates as shall,
in the largest possible measure, facilitate inter-
course among all the people, of every kindred and
of ^every cast. To facilitate intercourse, is to ad-
vance all the graat interests of society. The Post
Office is and was designed to be a great machine
for weaving a net-work of social, intellectual, and ,
commercial intercourse, that should spread among
all the people of the country. So far as we carry
out this design, our countrymen will advance and
rise in what is inseparably connected with the ■
substantial glory of the nation. |

It thus appears that from the States and Terri-
tories first mentioned in the foregoing official
schedule, the net annual revenue the past year
was $3,453,055, and that the cost of transporta-
tion was $1,201,688. Thus, the income in these
States exceeded the expenditure in these States in
the amount of 01,251,307.
In the other States and Territory, the net an-
nual revenue was $918,436, and the cost of trans-
! portation was $1,295,728; thus exceeding the in-
i come in the sum of $377,292.
j From these official statements, we may deduce
lessons of instruction not to be disregarded by any
I legislator, nor by any friend of his country and of
! humanity. Most sincerely do I desire to see the
day when intercourse shall be so facilitated, and
knowledge so diffused, that every human being
who treads our soil shall have the use of the Post
Office for the transmission of letters of business,
of intercourse, and of friendship, letters written
with his own hand, in his own tongue, for his own
: profit, and his own pleasure.
Mr. Chairman, we have more than thirty States,
and several Territories. Our national domain
stretches over twenty-four degrees of latitude, and
1 fifty-eight of longitude. We have a seaboard of
five thousand miles in a direct line; and of thirty
thousand, if you trace the indentations of the
coast. Our country spreads out from the almost
unrelaxing Winter of the North to the perpetual
Summer of the tropics; enjoying a climate not se-
I vere enough to dwarf the proportions of humanity,
nor sunny enough to induce imbecility. Our broad
lakes, our navigable rivers and harbors—our capa-
bilities of agriculture, and manufactures, and com-
i merce,and the skill, the science and the enterprise
of our people, have already placed us in a promi-
j nent position before the world. We must go on
' in improvement. This is the law of Heaven and
earth. People of every tongue and clime arejoin-
ing us. Let them come. The famine-stricken Irish-
men, the tax-crushed Portuguese, the exiled Hun-
garian ; let them all come and welcome. They come
to a land where there is room enough and tolera-
tion enough for all good and industnous citizens.
This country can give bread and business to a
thousand millions of human beings. It is for
such a country, and for all the dwellers in such a
country, that we are legislating, in this bill. Let
us enlarge our conceptions of our work, and legis-
late in a spirit commensurate with the wishes, and ,
telegraph announce it through the length and
breadth of the land, who can doubt that millions
upon millions would, on the morrow, greet each
other with a heartier happt new tear than has
been wont to mark the joyful interviews of friend-
ship on that joyousday ? And then the kind postal
greetings of parents and children—of brothers and
sisters—of neighbors and friends, when the num-
ber of letters shall have increased to three hundred
millions annually, will bear messages of love and
harmony througliout all our borders; find these
messages will afford our best guarantees for the
perpetuity of the Union, or make it what we all
desire, indissoluble.
I have said this is the last day of the firs t half
of the present century, a period that marks the
most eventful epoch of modern times; a period as
full of grandeur and magnificence as any part of
the Christian chronology. No other half century
of the Christian Era has unrolled such marvelous
deeds—such stupendous changes—such throes of
intellect—such reaches of discovery—such en-
largement of thought—such improvements—
such achievements—such progress. The world
has swept along at an accelerated rate, as if pro-
pelled by the mighty powers, to the useful appli-
cation of which this period has given birth. Du-
ring this half century, our territorial boundaries
have extended from the Mississippi to the Pacific,
and enlarged from an area of one million to
three and one quarter millions of square miles.
Fifteen States, of large dimensions, have been
added to the sisterhood of States. Congress has
increased its numbers, from thirty-two Senators to
sixtytwo; and from one hundred and ten Repre-
sentatives, to two hundred and thirty-three; and
our population has multiplied from five millions
to twenty-three millions.
The extension of the facilities of education and
information, in the form of primary, academic,
collegiate, and professional schools, and periodical
publications, has well-nigh kept pace with the in-
crease of population. In the year 1800, we num-
bered, all told, about two hundred newspapers in
the whole Union; now we have two thousand.
New England has nearly four hundred and New
York has nearly five hundred.
Our country, though young, has bome an hon-
orable- and a prominent part in the impulses given
to science, to inventions, to discovery. In the
progress of the arts, in the accumulation of
wealth, and in the extension of internal improve-
ments, her advances have no parallel.
About twenty canals, large, costly and useful,
have been constructed. Steamboats (unknown
fifty years ago) have multiplied upon our navi-
gable waters, till their tonnage is aDout two hun-
dred and sixty thonsand tons, and their value
about twenty millions of dollars.
Five thousand miles of railroads have been built
since 1827, at an expense of one hundred and
twenty-five millions of dollars. Of the mighty
achievements of temperance, of benevolence, of
Christianity, 1 will not det&in you to speak. My
purpose is only to suggest some of the evidences
of substantial progress in this country, which the
half century discloses; and to urge, as a crown-
ing measure in this series of improvements, that
we now give to the country postage on all letters,
for all distances, at two cents the half ounce. This
measure will meet the aspirations and promote the
interests of the people—of all conditions, and of
every calling. The people are ripe and ready for
the measure. Let us not disappoint them.
Mr. OTIS said:Mr. Chairman, the large vote by
which the rules were suspended, to enable the
House to take up this bill out of its order, was an
earnest of the favor in which it was held. With-
out that vote, there was little chance of reaching
it in time for its passage at this session. Now
that it is before us, it is all-important to have ac-
tion, immediate action. It is not with the expect-
ation of adding to the information already in
possession of the House and the country, that I
propose to address you; but with the hope of
concentrating that information upon the particular
