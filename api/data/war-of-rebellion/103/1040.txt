Brigadier General D. W. ADAMS,

Selma on Montevallo:

Captain Vance arrived with yours of 24th. Telegraphed you long since, asking whether you needed more artillery, but received no answer. Wrote you fully in reference to defense of your district. You ask for more infantry than is in whole department. I informed you that Forrest's entire force of cavalry would be thrown into your district whenever enemy's movements render it necessary. In meantime Roddey is ordered to report enemy's movement to you. If you have not enough infantry to garrison more than one place you should concentrate it whenever necessary at Selma, hat being most important point to defend. If Selma is not threatened, forces can be sent from there to Montgomery or other points that may be threatened. You are not expected to accomplish impossibilities. General Buford has been sent to your district to organize cavalry under General Buford has been sent to your district to organize cavalry under General Forrest's instructions. He will report to you. You have not answered communication about organizing employes in Government works. It is important they should be promptly and efficiently organized and drilled. They should, whenever necessary, be all sent to Selma.

The infantry force required by your letter of above date is more than the entire infantry force of this department. if the lieutenant-general commanding had 7,500 infantry he would consider himself in condition to assume the offensive and would never think of dividing [them] into several garrisons for your district. You have already been fully advised as to the defense it is expected you will make against any
