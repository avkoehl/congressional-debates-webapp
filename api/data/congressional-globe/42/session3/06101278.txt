THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 11,
of the Federal Government whose duty it may
be to defend against claims of this kind to
protect the courts against imposition. That
is: what I do not believe. I am not willing,
therefore, to open the doors of the Treasury in
this way to this kind of claims. I do not "be-
lieve it is my duty to do it.
- Mr. RAND4LL. Will the gentleman allow
me to ask him a question, which may be a
diversion, but which I think will be pertinent?
. Mr. KERR. Gertaiuly.
Mr. RANDALL. The gentleman says that
he has faith in all the Uriited States courts. I
want to know if he applies that remark to the
Louisiana courts.
Mr. KERR. Oh 1 Mr. Speaker, I am talk-
ing about the decent courts of the country. I
am not talking about indecent institutions like
the court of Judge Durell in Louisiana, or the
court of Judge Locke in Florida. I am sorry
to say that there are some United States
courts, not in this city, that are notoriously
corrupt, to the disgrace of themselves and the
dishonor of the country; they are entirely un-
trustworthy. I do not apply that remark, how-
ever, to any court in this city.
Now, on looking at a paper which I hold in
my hand, and to which the gentleman from
Kentucky [Mr. Beck] will refer directly,
Senate Executive Document No. 3, second
session Fortieth Congress, I find that on many
of these claims for building vessels of this
sort there has already been paid to the con-
tractors more than double the original contract
price for their work, and that in other eases they
have had large payments, amounting to hun-
dreds of thousands of dollars, showing that in
the prosecution of these claims it is simply an
effort of cunning on the part of the claimants
to see how much money they can get out of
the Treasury. I do not care how earnest or
how honest—and he is always honest—the
gentleman from Maine [Mr. Fiiye] may be in
defense of the right of these persons to a re-
hearing in the courts of the country; but I
say to him that I have no faith in the honesty
of their claims; not a particle.
During the prosecution of our war, in the
building of vessels all over the country, it be-
came a sort of settled common practice that a
contract with the Government amouuted to
nothing, and was entitled to no respect. No
party was bound by it. It did not bind either
the contractor or the Government. They all
were at liberty to swing loose whenever they
pleased. A contractor might give a final re-
ceipt on one day and come the next day and
demand more pay. Such was our experience
in the Secor case; such was our experience in
the Chorpenniag case ; such is our experience
to-day in reference to these claims ; and such
will always be our experience in this country,
so long as we go on in this limping, halting,
and scandalous way, opening the door of the
Treasury to day and closing it to-morrow, to
be reopened the next day for another grab.
I think it is time that we had stopped this kind
of legislation, and I oppose the enactment of
all such bills as this on general principles as
well as on the specific facts in each case.
Mr. BECK, of Kentucky. I desire only
three minutes time. It occurs to me from
what I have heard that these are claims which
ought not, in the first instance, to have been
referred to the Committee of Claims. They
are claims that properly belong to the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs, which is supposed to
be composed of men who have knowledge of
naval affairs, and who are brought in connec-
tion with the officers of the Navy. It does
not strike me that it is at all favorable to the
honesty of this claim that it has been taken
away from that committee.
1 find that the board that sat upon these
claims was composed of men who ought to
know something about them. It was com-
posed of J. B. Marchand, commodore and
president; J. W, King, chief engineer, and
Edward Foster, paymaster. After a thorough
investigation of these claims, this is the tabu-
lar statement they report, and which was called
for by the act of Congress ordering the invest-
igation :
Tabular statement showing the result of the action of the board appointed July 6, 1867, by the honorable Secretary of the Navy, to " examine
tlie claims of certain contractors for the construction of vessels of war and steam machineryunderact of Congress approved March 2,1867.
