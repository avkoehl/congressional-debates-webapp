Repeal of IndfpendentTreasury—Mr.  Shields.
H. of Reps.
the character of ih  power exercised m the esta-
blishment of thelnd pendent Treasury <ystem, and
¡ueh the purpose and tendency of its practical ope
rations Eesi-aint upon the power or right of the
S ates to employ all constitutional means for the
encouragement and support of credit, public or pri-
vate, constitut s no part of the framework or in
tendment of the system So far a-, credit and cur
rencv are concerned, Us effect is <i nply to confine
the Federat Government, in the collection and dis-
bursement of its, revenue exclus,vely to the u e of
gold and «liver The effect of an exclusive use of
the precious m-etal*. by the Government, in the col-
lection aad disbursement of Us revenue, must ne-
cessarily be to increase ihe demand for those me-
tal  at home, to cause a much greaier p-onorlion of
them to remain here after tl ev are . nportf d, in ex-
change for the product ons oí the labor of thf coun-
try, and find emp'oyment m the various chann 1 
rf business, -u d thus enlarge and render more solid
and worthy of confidence the basis of credit, cur-
rency, pnd commerce
To maintain a gold and silver standard of value,
and practically a gold and silver medium foi the
payment of debts, so far as the effects and influence
cf ih  fiscal action of the Givernment will teid to
such a result, is in shor, the. purpose and the mo
(ittj operandi of the Independent Treasury sjstem
And, sir, «ho will deny that a policy leading to
such results is not rigid!/ enjoined upos the Go-
vernment by the whole spirit, tenor, and Inter of
the Constitution A denial of th- proportion .s
indeed matter of surprise
Tarn your attention for a moment to the mone-
tary condition of ihe country What a.e the fids'*
We have indeed but h tie money, or of that nhich
is a true representative of money, in circulate in
the country We have a currency consisting al
most exclu ively of piomisory notes, or "bii's of
credit," issued by bauK.tg corp ra'ion=, wine1) arc
employed if the busmes  tran net ons of ihe coun
try, to the exclusion of the money of the Const tu-
tion;—its exclusion, not only from tho-e business
transactions, but e\en from a local habitation in
the country
I find in document No 111, reporte i by the Se-
cretary oí the Treasury to the HoU'e of Represen-
ta ives on the 3i of March last, tne following tablt,
which gives a "compárame view of the conditi n

In wh^t branch of none^t mdustrv ard r "u!ar
bJS ness can a man afford to borrow and p<ap!oy
capi'al at the rate of e'.eipnper cent perannu-n?
Can the planter or the farmer at iMs i ¿'e a'iord to
borrow ¡he capital which he invests m his la^ds,
oto k,  provisons, and implements? or   the rue
chame the capital whi h he lcvesib in his tools, h s
lumber, hi!, iron, his clotl i or ihe merchant the ca-
pital he invests in his trade? No, sir Who,
then, can afford to employ money at this rate? No
one but gamblers at the laro bank or ihe roulette
table, or some other branc i of their vocation—
speculators and stockjobbers, monev ^haiers and
note-ihaver-, whose busings grows out of the em-
barrassments and suffenrgs ol their fellow men,
brought about by the seductive influences of this
system.
Such is the tax levied by ihe bankrg sj'tem m
all the various forms of itsirfluence and opera-
tions upon ihe countrj, or, rather, upon the pro-
ducing clashes ot the country, upon whom all the
burdens of society rest. Its tendency is to increase
the number of gambler'-, of speculator's, and stock-
j ibbers, cf raonej-havers and notecbavers, and
of idlers and drones, throughout societv, wherever
it operate": to render he human heart callous and
ind fferent t > human suffering, covetous and ava-
ricious, lo dtstratt the mnd with sudden, and of-
ten ruinous changes of fonun<-, to breed discontent
and mi-ery, demomhze sccc y, and counteract the
ko'y influences ef reitgien And piay what are ihe
advantages claimed for «ociety, m compensation
ior the ¡oul suppurations i«suing from this fungus
upon its bod}? Why, sir, the poor, miserable—
nay, I mistake, accoidmg to modern philosophy—
the very great and mapprectab'e advantage of
using the uncertain and fluctuating paper credits of
banks as the currency of tneeonntr , instead of ihe
gold and silver corns of the Constitution, which
would rapidly fi 1 up and occupy the channels of
circulation, if they were not expelled an I kept out
ot the coun',y by 'he c rculation of b2nk paper
and the errors of bank financiering
The last item ra ihe statement before alluded to
represents th nelt circulation of the bank-—wh ch
means, I suppose, the actual amount of paper cir-
culating in the hand  oí the people—to be
$86,170,680
To this we must add the item of de-
pos tes, v hi bin all   cf (he  corn-
men lal cities con titules the most
effective part ot bank ciiculation,
bemp represented  by  checks and
transfers of credit on the books of
banks
The whole amount of bank circula-
tion thus being   ...
75 696 857
161 867 537
In addition to this, there is estimated
to be in the country partially circu
latmg, but mainly hoarded up, an
amount ot   ihe  precious   meta'a
somewhere between loity and fifty
million?—say       -           -           -   $45,000 000
But it i  'he paper part of the currency that I am
now considering, and to which I shall conflnp my
reirarki.
From a hasty examination of the document lo
which I ha^e refered, (No 111,) I came to 'he con-
clusion that something near two thirds (600) of all
the banks in the Urnon, wielding about the same
proportion of the aggregate banking capital, are
new in a stale of suspenbion, and that somethm 
over two thirds of the whole aggregate of the bank
currency of the country corsets in their paper and
credits The proportion, then, of bank emulation
not convertible into specie, and now used by the
people as the mpj irpart of their currency, may be
es'imated at some hmg near $110,000 0C0 The
different kinds and classes tl paper comprising
this rrass are variously depreciated below specie par
thr ufhout Uie Union, varying from thae per cent
as the minimum, to fifty per cent as the max'mum
ratts of depreciation, an I mis, sir,—the privilege
'i using'he paper ciedi s of banks as currency,
halle, a whatever/ rm ihe syste n may exist, with or
without a Nanrnal Bank, to such depreciation,
fluctuation and mobility m value—is ihe great
advantage realized by the peode in consideration
of the heavy tax annually lev.ed upon them to
■¡tstam the exp-nsive -íaehinery and usurious pro
fits of thi bppkmg system And here, sir I beg to
ca 1 you-wtenLon to a mo-t interesting part of the
subject, which constitutes the ground of daily and
