HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,July 1, 1864.

General MEADE:

The musketry seems to be on the part of the enemy in Burnside's front; some artillery now being used. Some cheering brought it on, but don't know what it was about.

Major-General.

General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

GENERAL: Two deserters from the Twenty-second North Carolina, Scales' brigade, of Wilcox's division, which is in my front, came into my lines last night. They report the infantry force which supported their cavalry in the attack upon Wilson as being Mahone's brigade and that Scales moved to the railroad this morning. They report that the enemy are placing some heavy guns in position opposite Burnside, and that our shells go into the town. I have sent them to Major Rider.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
