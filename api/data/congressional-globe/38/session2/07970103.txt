method of avoiding the creation of class distinc-
tions, and escaping an aristocracy of capital, is to
see to it that the citizen is taxed as nearly as pos-
sible in proportion to his means. * Agy system
of taxation that does not draw revenue chiefly
from the classes best able to pay is inconsistent
with republican institutions, and must ultimately
be overthrown by the vote of the masses, or itself
overthrow the democratic constitution of society.
It seems to me evident that our only reliance is
upon a judicious system of taxation. Out legis-
lation of late in relation to the imposition of duties
upon the importation of foreign goods has greatly
diminished our revenue from that source, and foi-
st time, at least, we cannot expect much in that
direction.
The Journal of Commerce of New York, a most
valuable, reliable, and influential commercial pa-
per, very justly says:
"The tariff adopted 011 the 30th of June last will have
the effect of checking the process of supplying our wants
in foreign maikets. The duties are so enormously heavy
tiiat it is next to impossible to import any important amount
of goods. It necessitates the importer to have literally two
capitals, one for paying for his goods, and a second for pay-
ing his duties. A merchant buying in England £20,000
worth of dry goods requires $100,000 in gold to remit in
payment, and at the same time has to deposit about $60,000
in gold at the custom-house. The absorption of so much
capital in duties, of course, reduces the importer's means
for purchasing; and the consequence is that the amonntof
the imports declines. The importer has to add the addi-
tional duly to the price of his goods, and must charge his
ordinary rate of profit upon the extra duty, resulting in
such an increase of the prices of goods as limits their con-
sumption, The effect of these tendencies is clearly appar-
ent in the large reduction of the volume of the imports
since the enhanced duties went into operation. For the
six months ending June 30,1864, the period when the new
tariff went into operation, the imports were $138,500,000;
tor the succeeding six months the imports were only $80,-
000,000, showing a decline of $58,500,000 during the first
six months under the enhanced tariff. And dunngthe first
seven weeks of the current calendaryear, the imports have
been only @13,500,000, or at the rate of $100,000,000 per
annum, which is equivalent to a reduction of $118,000,000,
as compared with the imports of last year."
It is worthy of note, sir, how England, the
heavily and yet the best taxed of all countries,
derives her revenue. It appears from the account
of public income and expenditure, published by
order of the House of Commons of Great Britain
on the 6th February, 1863, that with an exception
trifling in comparison with the amount under con-
sideration, the interest on nearly $4,000,000,000,
the national debt of thatcountry, is entirely paid
by the duties on two articles, spirituous liquors
and tobacco. The interest for the yearending31st
March, 1869, was .£25,541,706, or about $128,700,-
000, while the revenue derived from the above
sources during the same year was $123.7^0,000.
An income of about $50,000,000 more is derived
from tea, sugar,and molasses. Coffee, currants,
raisins, and pepper furnish $4r0c5,000. About
$5,000,000 are raised from duties-ia imported grain
and timber, $1,500,000 from ^aper, $7,500,000
from excise licenses and pGst-/\orse duties. Prom
charges on bills of lading, '/Sime certificates, rail-
ways, stage, and hackney carriages, accrue about
$4,500,000. Prom these n sources alone, except-
ing a few miscellaneous articles yielding about
$1,000,000, the Britiift Government derives .£41,-
985,495, about$20p,500,000, almost entirely from
articles of luxury soid superfluity. From stamps
is derived a revenjeof<£8,590,654, or $42,500,000;
assessed and knd taxes, $16,000,000; property
income tax, <410,471,208, or $52,000,000; post
office, $16!Q$,">,000; miscellaneous revenues,about
$10,000,000, in all an income of £69,900,859 dur-
ing the year in question. The total charges of
collecting the revenue during the same year were
<f2,511,180, orabout $12,500,000. The salaries and
•xpenses of both Houses of Parliament (includ-
ing printing) were <£1,583,812, about $7,500,000.
The expenses of courts of justice, police, &c.,
ivere .£3,433,138, or $17,000,000, much more than
twice those of the civil government. The diplo-
matic service cost $2,100,000. The cost of naval
and military forces, including operations in China,
cost of fortifications, &c., was $151,500,000.
The various miscellaneous expenses, including
^2,131,338 for the post office, (being about
$7,000,000 less than the income from it,) were
•£7,622,277, The whole expenditures during 1862
having been .£72,151,786, (about $360,000,000,)
exceeding (.£69,900,857) the income during the
same year by ^£2,250,929, or about $11,000,000.
The last British report (1864) shows the fol-
lowing amount of revenue, and the sources from
whence derived:
Customs £23,232,000
Excise  18,207,000
Stamps  9,317 000
Taxes  3,218,000
Property and income tax   9,084,000
Post office  3,810,000
Crown lands  305,000
Old stores and extra receipts, naval and mili-
tary departments  631,993
Surplus fees, extra receipts, civil departments,
unclaimed dividends  2,403,971
£70,208,964
As we must mainly rely in the future upon a
proper system of taxation, I hope the proposition
of the Committee of Ways and Means author-
izing the Sesretary of the Treasury to appoint a
commission consisting of three persons to inquire
and report at the earliest practicable moment upon
the subject of raising by taxation such revenue
as may be necessary in order to supply the wants
of the Government, will be adopted by this Con-
gress, as such a plan is eminently proper with a
view to make taxation bear justly and impartially
upon the people.
The bill under consideration is objectionable
in permitting a further issue of Treasury notes.
The tendency will be, I fear, further inflation of
the currency, with all the attending consequences.
I had hoped that some plan for funding the public
debt would have been presented at the present
session. We must at the earliest moment return
to a sound system of finanoe; the great excess of
paper issue must be withdrawn, the expenses of
the Government diminished, and the debt furided
and placed in process of liquidation, or the coun-
try will culminate in general bankruptcy, and
perhaps repudiation. While the resources of
the country are not adequate to meet the present
and accruing liabilities, still upon the return of
peace we may hope for such a rapid development
of the vast wealth of the country as will enable
the people to bear lightly the gigantic debt that
will be created during the war between contend-
ing States whose greatness and power depend
upon unity instead of separation.
CABINET OFFICERS IN CONGRESS.
V
SPEECH OF HON. GEO. H. PENDLETON,
of oiiio,
In the House of Representatives,
March 3,1865,
On thp bill (H. R,. No. 214) to provide that the heads of
Executive Departments may occupy seats on the floor
of the House of Representatives.
Mr. PENDLETON. Mr. Speaker, I desire to
express to the House my thanks for the courtesy
by which, at this late hour of the session, I am
permitted to address it. My acknowledgments
will be made most fittingly by an earnest endeavor
so to avail myself of that permission that no hon-
orable gentleman upon the floor will regret that
it was unanimously given. The bill before the
House is in these words:
Be it enacted hy the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United- State* of JJmerica, m Congress assembled, That
the Secretary of Slate, the Secretary of the Treasury,
the Secretary of War, the Secretary of the Navy, the Sec-
retary of the Interior, the Attorney General,and the Post-
master General, shall be entitled to occupy seats on the
floor of the House of Representatives, with the right to
participate in debate upon matters relating to the business
of their respective Departments, under sueh rules as may
be prescribed by the House.
Sec. 2. Jind be it further enacted, That the said Secre-
taries, the Attorney General, and the Postmaster General,
shall attend the sessions of the House of Representatives
immediately on the opening of the sittings on Mondays
and Thursdays of each week, to give information in reply
to questions which may be propounded to them under the
rules of the House.
If no other good result shall come from this dis-
cussion, we have at-least gained this: that every
gentleman who has participated in the debate—of
whatever shade of political opinion, whatever
views he may have taken of this particular meas-
ure—has declared that the powers of the executive
department of the Government ought not to be
increased. I sympathize entirely with that opin-
ion, and it is because I believe that this measure,
if adopted, will exercise a restraining
upon an overgrown and now abnormal.power'tiiat
I am so strenuous In it§ advocacy. " The gentle-
man who sits behind me [Rlr. Cox] and the gejj-.
tleman from Vermont, not now in his seat, (Wjr,
Morrill,] oppose this measure because, in thjjjr
opinion, it will increase the powers of the execu-
tive department of the Government. Thegent)|-
manfrom Pennsylvania who sits over the way op-
poses if. because he thinks it will diminish the
powers of the Executive. 1 will not stop here to
place their arguments side bysid,g to antagonize
each other. These gentlemen all agree that this"
measure is unconstitutional; that it encroaches >
upon the rights of the Stales, and that it will de-
stroy the legitimate influence of Congress under
the Constitution.
If 1 believed the adoption of this measure would
requirean amendment ofihe Constitution I would
abandon it instantly, for 1 have too long resisted
any amendment of that instrument to commend it
now. If I believed that it trenched upon the rights
of the States I would abandon it at once, fori ana
firmly persuaded that consolidation is despotism,
and that confederation is liberty. If I believed
that it would increase the powers of the Execu-
tive I would abandon it at once, for I believe, in
the language of a celebrated resolution of another
day and country, that the influence of the Exec-
utive has increased, is increasing, am} ought to
be diminished. I accept the doctrine put forward
by my colleague with such emphasis, that they
who advocate a change must support it by argu-
ment, and I propose to show that the measure
which this committee reports is constitutional*
that it will not infract the rights of the States;
that it will elevate the character of this House;
that it will elevate the character of the Depart-
ments; that it will benefit both legislation and
administration.
I address myself at once, sir, to the constitu-
tionality of this measure. Its constitutionality
depends upon the answer to two questions: first,
hasthisHouse thepowerto open iLs doors and in-
vite to the floor any person whom it chooses, with
such rights of speech as it may see fit to confer?
ami-next, has Congress—not the House alo'ne,
but Congress—the power to impose upon the
pleads of Departments such duties as it believes
appropriately belong to the positions they hold?
The power of this House to open its doors to
whomsoever it sees fit 1 will not argue, in face
of the constitutional guarantee that it "shall de-
termine the rules of its proceedings," and in [he
face of the uniform practice—never departed from
—from the time the FirstCongress was organized
until the day, within two weeks, when, by your
permission, General Grant in the Speaker's chair
received the obeisance of its members. The
power of Congress to impose duties upon the
heads of the Departments 1 will not argue, in face
of the law organizing the Treasury Department,
enacted in 1789, under which that Department
has been administered up to this date, by the
terms of which, by a simple resolution, the Sec- .
retary may be required to come upon the floor
and explain the measures which he recommends;
and in the face of every law which has been passed
for the organization of the Executive Depart-
ments, from that day to this, commanding every
one of these Secretaries to report, in one case or
another, directly to Congress.
It seems to me that the answers to these two
questions settle the constitutional power. If this
House has the right to open its doors and invite
these Secretaries to be present, and if Congress
has the right to say to these Secretaries that it is
their duty to accept the invitation of the House,
there would seem to be no question of power
left.
But gentlemen say that this argument is too
technical, that it sticks in the bark; that such may
be the construction of the letter but not the spirit
of the Constitution. And we are told that these
heads of Departments are the clerks, the depu-
ties, the agents,of the President; thatthey think
with his thoughts; speak with his voice, and
act with his hands; that their acts are his acts;
that they are amenable to him, and not to Con-
gress, and that to admit them to participate in
legislation would be violative of the fundamental
