in my opinion, responded to any further calls made upon her, but without it it would be impossible to raise any considerable number. Efforts to fill up the old regiments are still being made, but our success has [been] trifling for the past sixty days. I have to advise, however, that the effort be continued.

Respectfully, yours,

DAVID TOD,

Governor.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Congressional bill passed House of Representatives does not prohibit colored officers in colored regiments. Will you withdraw prohibition so far as concern line officers assistant surgeons, and chaplain of my proposed colored regiment? It will avoid difficulty. Power would not be used except possibly for few cases of plainly competent persons recommended by the field officers, who shall be gentlemen and soldiers of highest merit and influence.

JOHN A. ANDREW.
