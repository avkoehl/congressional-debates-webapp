Colonel BENJAMIN P. RUNKLE,

Commanding Cynthiana, Ky.:

COLONEL: Your dispatch to General Royle received. Will send you the first cavalry available. Can you seize enough horses belonging to disloyal persons to mount, say, 100 of your men? How many persons have you arrested, and have you undoubted proof against them? Have no artillery to spare now. You can successfully repel any attack without it.
