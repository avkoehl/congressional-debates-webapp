a*cHtzen. TrTegcame hete íesung upon the declaration of his
father, made in 1822 that he was an inhabitant of Florida at
tbet|fíí©of the cession, and entitled to all the pijvileges and
immwimtes guarantied under the ¡sixth article of the treaty be
tween Spam and the United States And he came here rely
régontne ascerMnment of that fact by a tribunal appointed
by theUmtett States^ for the supreme government of that
Territory, and v>hich issued, upon that ascertainment, a certifi
cate of citizenship, which was forwarded to the Government,
and placed on fire \a the State Department He rested not
only on the continued exercise of citizenship from that time,
bul on the solemn, and unanimous decision ol the hashes juchca
ture of Florida, composed of men of the highest character and
reputation:
Hé.had come here, and had found himself met by a remon
sirarice—-a voluntary affidavit made two years ago, unauthenti
cated, ttnsustamed bytestimony, andalsoby newspaper paia
graphs and. editorials marked íound, not for the purpose of
proving facts, but for the purpose of making an effect
He had held himself on his íeserved righ's until there
should be a sufficient ground upon which to base the
Charge
Mr L then went at some length into the proceedings of the
Committee on Elections, into a statement of his own course
there, and into the decision of the committee—arguing there
t from that time had not been allowed to him to present ins case
fairly and fully, that any decision made at this time must be
one&ided—that it must be based upon the testimony of perso
nal, bitter, malignant enemies, who were heie to puisue this
matter, and to pursue him to destruction, wh.lst his own wit
neases were a thousand miles off Tt might be asked why he had
not sent for them? To this he would reply, that the mail from
this city to St Augustine took ten to fomteen days in trans
mission, thata month would have been required to heai from
ihefiPCe, and that, at the fme the necessity to produce
witnesses become apparent to him, no man supposed
that the session would have been protiaeted as it has been
The committee hud determined to rest the case upon the issue
Gfifthahuancy He felt assured thata case of inhabitancy, wi h
m the meaning oi the treaty, i ould be presented, and he aslctd
the House to allow him time and opportunity to present it, as he
fett confident he could But, without a postponement, m was
impossible he could present the cast clearly
Mr L alluded to passing observation , made on foimei davs
by Mr Stanly and Mr Iialsted, in relation to the NewJu
sey case, and deprecated, m the most earnest mannei any invo
cation of party feeling or any allusion to the excited scenes oí
the New Jersey i ornes t, whu h coul 1 only result in prejudice
to him, and m preventing a just and 'inpai íat decision of his
case
Mr L conclude i by offering the following resolution

(Mr* H > should have thought that the gentleman had
adduced the stiongest iea&on why it ought not to be
postponed, and the veiy fact that he desned a postpone
ment must be satisfactory evidence that he dare not icly upon
the testimony h<> had adduced Besides, the gentleman had
not undertaken to show that he could obtain any additional evi
dence material to his case The cliarge that he was an alien
had been made three years ago, anu had been reiterated also
during the last canvas*  Now, when a charge of this kind wa&
made, so sexio sin its consequences as the gentleman today
seemed to consider it, why had he sat still undei it for three
years and not attempted to deny the allegation Aler refei ring
to several other facts in the case, Mr H concluded with say
ing that he did not think the gentleman had any right to under
take to show, as hehad done, i at the decision of the commit
teewasunjubt He would assume, for the sake of theargu
ment, that the committee weie wrong, but that was no reason
why the case should be postponed He hoped the House
would not agree to any such proposition
Mr McKEONiemaiked that he was at a loss whether to
take part irj this discussion or not He was fearful that any
suggestion from him muht harm lathei than benefit the sitting
member If party feeling was permitted to operate he (Mr
MtK ) knew that any support the delegate from Florida might
receive fiom the inteifeience of the minority would notaid his
application Yet he could not believe that this question, or the
rights of the delegate of the people of the Territory, would he
made a lest of party allegiance Highei and more honorable
motives would actuate us sitting heie asjidge  m this matter
The delegate asks for a postponement until the next session,
and he trusted that the House would not deny the req nest The
situation of the caseboie some lestmblance to a judicial pro
ceeding as «tatedby the ch'iinanof the Committee on Klec
Uor1*, [AIt Halsted,] and lor that reason that gen leman was
disposed to apply to it the strict rules of a judicial nbunal on

own impression is, that, even if he be an alien, still, under the
law regulating the election of a delegate from the Terntory, he
is entitled to hi« seat The only restriction in that law on the
peo¡ le of the Terntory is that they shall elect as their dele
gateaiesident for twelve months m the lerutory (Act of

constitutional piovision However, others mav requne evi
