Recent dispatches received from General Lee represent affairs so different from heretofore, I would like you to telegraph me the exact news from the front, as there may be some mistake. Please say where Lee's forces are and where the enemy are.

Colonel YOUNG:

The enemy are advancing on the Clinton and Raymond road from Champion's Hill; 6 or 8 prisoners have been taken. From all I can learn McPherson's corps is on this road. There is another column across Big Black. Prisoners say their force is 30,000. Will not be able to develop their entire strength till they are more concentrated, as they are on several roads.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
