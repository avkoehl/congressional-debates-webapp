he considered the question on that repeal the vital question of
the discussion The Senator himself said, a few days ago, on
another accasion, that the simple question after all was, whether
the amount of distribution should be raised by the direct taxa
tion of the State Governments, or by the more mild exercise of
the power of mduect taxation by the General Government It
ia, then, at once an admission that the question comes to this,
-whether Congress shall or shall not use the taxing power of the
General Government for the purpose of raising revenue to be
distributed to the States for State purposes
To provide, taxes to pay the debts of the States is not to pro-
vide for the payment of the debts due by the General Govern
meat If taxes are to be so raised for distribution on the pre
text of being for the general welfare, are they not to be expend-
ed on local roads, canals, and other purposes, exclusively fall-
ing within the functionsand duties of State Government?
He read from the third section of the fourth article of the Con-
stitution the following passage
"The Congress shall have power to dispose of and make all
needful rules and regulations respecting the territory or other
property belonging to the United States,"
And commented at some length on the attempts to torture
thw clause into an authonty for distribution He contended
that if the doctrine maintained hy the friends of distribution be
tha sound and constitutional doctrine, the authority of Congress
is as great over the whole property as over the whole territory,
and what does it result in but leaving at the discretion of Con
gress unlimited powers? It removes all bounds to appropria-
tions, and leaves that power co extensive with the means of ex-
penditure It 13 a new reading of the Constitution, and oae
which, if once established, will put it out of the power of this
country toc-istrepioaches m future on the supremacy of Parha
ment m Great Bi 'am, to di&pose of the whole property of the
realm
But it is said Congies  has power to borrow money—and
there is no limitation He had supposed there was always a
limit to its application to the payment of pre existing debt**, or
the common defence of the country and genera! welfare of the
"Lri'on itself-not the nartial (welfare of the States separately
considered, but the mtegeral welfare of the union But if this
power of borrowing money is to be extended to the principle of
b3i rowing money to form a fund for after appropriations lead
mg to distribution, he knew of no bounds that could be set to
the powers of Congres , and it would be idle to talk of checks
and balances on the action of legislation
H* next alluded to the act of Congress authorizing the State
of Virginia to adjust land claims on the General Government
which Congress bojnd itself to pay and what had been the
resul ? Had not this Government already paid an amount,
undei that arrangement, ten times greater than any man had
evert teamed of*
This was a proof of the folly of separating the power of ap
piopi latina money fiom the power of raising it by taxation
Bysepdiating these responsibilities, a field is opened for the
Wildes- chaos in Government that can be conceived If it could
be proved that the same constituency receive and pay, it might
he proved thai.the only difference would be theexpense of the
operation Hut n> that nice adjustment possible? The least
refit-cti >n proves it is not The consumption of imported ar
tides paying duty m this extended country, never can be in
proportion to representative population Some* districts will
consume more than others, and gome less A particular article
3s not essential to one district, and the people of that district
•urge it;, taxation Another article is essential, and its taxation
i  íes sixd One portion of the country has a deep interest in
the tax u ion which piotects its interests another portion looks
upon su( h taxation as the grossest injustice to its intercuts For
whatgool do we fasten this policy on the country in thefaceof
these greatdingeis? Yei for what? To give the people mo
ney? Thatis absurd It 13 not even an operation by which
the good neutral zes the evil, for there isa deadlossof the ex
penMsof the operation It is a system wmch must, if per
siatelin, bring about the destruction of this Union The mo
ment the ¡>> stem comes to be acted upon Congies? will findite
own actions thrown back upon iU>elf causing embarrassments
dp/on 1 any calculation He spoke not of resistance, bat of other
fifís r ts
Th^ great reason utged for the adoption of the svsiem at this
time is, to rdieve the indebted States No man felt more than
he d d fii the condition ol in ieb'ed States yet he felt bound to
say, the General Government had no right to interpose, the
power of íeíief lay in the State Governments, which in their
legitimate Junctions are bound to tax the property of the States
to pay the debts oí the States, oi to keep them free from debt
Tha Senator had drawn a parallel of a parent distributing
msprjpetty tohis children Why not put the casein its true
colors and tell the peop'e of the Sutes that the real nature of
the parallel would be a parent whose income was inadequate to
hu expenditures, and whose estate was in debt going to his
chi'dren and saying, 'I will tlist ibute to you part of the in
come of my estate, and yon shall pay it back to me, with as
much m addition of your own money a^ will refund me all my
expenditures m consequence of the operation ,J Would the
cmldten think him foi this manifestation of his parental regard1
When the system i« once adopted, is there any thing to confine
the General Government to thebole distribution of the land
fund? What, in time, is to prevent a demand from the inte
ie>ts> whose greatest profits arise out of protection that a pio
tectivp revenue should be raided ind distributed or the iron in
terejf, or anv other interest in succession, making similar de
inaidfe, till dis ribution would re<tch to any possible amount
wh ntrvxtiou could furnish? I is not the necessary conse
que ice, that appropriations will be only a secondary considera
t on, the savins; of the public money for distubution being the
j ¡miry objeu and that object subjecting member of Congress
t influences dangerous enough to piostrate the legitimate pow
CI  oJ Government, and Mibstitute influences of the most cor
rtipf and cectiuaivc niturt
Mr W showed thx effect of the policy upon the credit of the
countiy m foreign monry mai kpt and asked how won! 1 it im
prove or sustain the credit of an individual m the habit ofpledg
ng his estate whenever he had occasion to borrow money, to
give a vay tm e fate, and then go to the customary money lend
ers offering them hu  note instead of his estate for a pledge!
What would be the result in the case of the individual under
s<ich circums anee?* has been result with regard to this Govern
menf«mce itgaveawayits estate by the Distribution act Its
rres'it m the foreign money markets shows the consequence of
s,uch policy
Thefustcouiseof a prudent and wise Government is, to pro
yk10 for its own necessities before it undertakes io be bountiful
to others It was bound to be just towards itself, and its credi
tors, hefore it undertook to be generous at their expense to
others
Which form of the resolutions shall be taken? Shall the Se
nate consent to repeal the clause m the Distribution act, or reite
rate that it was the only condition on which the act was passed,
and therefore it bhould not be repealed"1
He had for some fime considered that the long sessions of
Congress hadbecome too piotracted And to limit this abuse,
he knew of no remedy but to fix the day of adjournment at the
Yery outset of the session
[Many Senators expressed their assent ]
Mr CLAY, from his seat the one hour rule sir, the one hour
rule'
Mr WRIGHT contended that the one hour rule would
not be so efficacious as fixing the day of adjournment If every
member of the Senate was to indulge in as much talking as the
Senator from Kentucky, [Mr Clay,] and himself, (Mi
Wright,) and each was to be entitled to his hour a day, they
could easily speak out a much longer session than the longest
complained of
Mr W next entered into an examination of other proposed
reforms, and expressed his readiness to go as far as any man
m reference to retrenchment in Congress, retrenchments
in the civil list, and ii eveiy other department of the Govern
ment
With regard to tre expense of punting for Congress, he con
ceived the best way of reaching reform, would be to take away
the privilege of franking public documents If members of
Congress could not send printed matter from Congress under
their franking privilege iheie would be no occasion found for
ordering the punting of fne and ten thousand copies of public
documents This dissemination of punted matter was jnju
nous to the public press of the country He did not be
lieve that Congress was diffusing public information more
effectually than the same object could be effected by the public
press
He argued that an increased postase ought to he imposed
on newspapers and periodical packages m proportion to
the weight—for they m addition to the documents from Con
gress were weighing down the mails, and embarrassing the
Post Office Department by their enormous increase m bulk and
weight
He thanked the Senate for the attention with which he had
been favored
Mr SMITH of Indiana, expressing a wrsh to speak on the
subject, and the hour being late,
The Senate, on motion to that effect, adjourned

Mr F be level that the convenience of the members would
be consumed and a caving of time effected by receiving their
letters through the city post ffitt, where there was so much
moe force than in thepos office attached to the House
He had no com] amt to make of the present postmaster
J That officer (Mr, F   believed) discharged his duties with
fidelity, but in these times of reform, he believed it would be
a satisfaction to that individual to be cut off for the good of his
country.
Mr HOPKINS suggested such a modification of the amend
ment proposed by the gentleman from New York, (Mr.
Floyd,) as would embrace all other offices connected with the
post office of this House, which modification was adopted.
Mr H said that he thanked the gentleman from New York
for offering his amendment, although he had anticipated him
m doing so He considered the office not only as requiring an
expenditure of public money both inexpedient and unwarranta-
ble, but absolutely inconvenient to members themselves In
corroboration of this statement, he would bring to the coneide-
rationofthe House a fact wi hmhis own, and, doubtless, withm
the knowledge of most of the Southern members The mail
arrives here from the South about. 4 o'clock in the morning.
and under the present expensive arrangement is delivered to
us about 9 o'clock at night It would be far more convenient
for members to send a servant, if they cannot go themselves, to
the City Post Office for their mails [Some member speakinc
across the hall, said some members do that now] Yes, said
Mr H and by doing so, they get then mads some hours ear-
lier Let us all do so, and we may not only dispense with a
most useless expenditure, but we shou d exclude from this hall
the newspapers, pamphlets and letters which engross the time
and attention of gentlemen, and call them off from those legis-
lative duties which we have been sent here to perform
Should the amendment prevail, it will result in a saving of
perhaps some eight or ten thousand dollars per annum, and, in
times like thee, whatever is calculated to lessen the public bur-
dens without real detriment to the public revenue, challenges
the favorable consideration of all those who sympathise with
the people in the emban assments which now pervade the land
He admitted that this might be regaided a^a small matter,
but it is by the aggregation of many small matters that our
expendituies have so far outgrown the business and population
of the nation, and unless abuses be attacked and remedied in
detail, his experience as a member of this House satisfied him.
that they would never be remedied at all.
Let not gentlemen, he said, who are the friends of leform,
wait for other schemes, or postpone this subject to a more
convenient season, for the time to make reform is far less im-
portant than the reform itself, and, so far as this subject is
concerned, now is the hour, now the time He confessed he
felt the more solicitude to see this expense dispensed with,
from a thorough conviction that it is worse than useless.
He appealed to gentlemen, then, to give up and relinquish
this expense The people have honored us with their confi
dence, and pay us libeially for our sei vices. They have cheer-
fully paid for the transportation of our mail matter, and with
this we should, he thought, be content Let us abolish the post
office of this House, and if the benate will not consent to fol-
low our example and abolish the other, for one lam ready to
take the responsibility of refusing them the means of paying
the expense of it We hold the puree strings, and if no other
alternative be left us, my word for it, the people will say to
us, hold on to the purse
But, Mr Speakei, whilst this is a subject which comes direct'
lyhome to ourselves, and challpnges, ior that reason, the ap-
probation of all of us who intend to practise upon our precepts,
I cannot but fear that it will be defeated If it should, let gen-
tlemen who defeat it hereafter devote their zeal and eloquence
to other topics than economy, retrenchment, and reform, and
if the people be content to bear the expense of ten or fifteen
thousand dolíais per annum for having our mails broughtand
laid upon our mahoginy desks, that we may sit in our maho-
gany, cushioned chairs to lead them, instead of devoting our
whole time and attention to our legislative duties, then I have
only to say, thf ir will, not mine, be done
The SPEAKER here inquired of Mr ülmmers if he accept-
ed the amendment as a modification of the resolution?
Mr SUMMERS suggested that ho was aware that several gen-
tlemen had amendments which they desired to offer, and he
hoped that the resolutions reported by the committee would be
acted upon seriatimm the first instance, and that then any ad-
ditional propositions which gentlemen might desire to submit
should be offered He did not think that the question of the
abolition of the post office came fan ly within the scope of the
resolution under considei ation, which was simply to provide
for the abolition of the office of draughtsman
There was however, a subsequentresolution reported by the
committee which had reference to the post office and where
the amendment would, at all events, be more appropriate than
here
Mr HOPKlNSasked theyeasand nays on the amendment;
which were ordered
Mr BOWNE desired to inquire whether the postmaster wag
not wanted to distnbutc stationeiy and, if so, whether some
one would not have tobe employed and whether any thing
would be gained by the adoption of the amendment!
Mr FLOYD said that if the postmaster distributed sta-
tionery he did it meiely as an agent of the Clerk, and the
=iame thing could be done by any one of the agents of the
Clerk
Mr HOPKINS A clerk may be paid to do it
Mr BOWNE sai 1 that, by the adoption of the first of the
series of resolution* the numerical force of the clerks had been
<ío reduteda' thatthuse who yetremamed would be employed
tonstantly without reference to this business It wuuld, there-
fore be necessary to emply some othei person* probably, to
be sure, it might be done at a small expense, but, in his opi-
nion the reform would he a very small one
He was disponed to go the whole length of-eform He wished
to see that principle carried out wherever it could be done with
borne practical effect and benefit It had been ¡-aid, that if re-
form did rot commer e here it would not commence at all He
did not think so He í ehrved that the a were places where re-
form could be piacttcaflv c-nd advantageously effected But a
mere desire to have a show of ieform t n paper he was not m
favor of, and this plan of aiming at the postmaster or a few
clerks who werp engaged m hard ldbor cervn s ttV members of
the House and serving the public appeared 'otim o be a sort
of picayune business Tl ere weie matters he repeated, m
which real reform might be effected—such a reform as the peo
pie would feel But he had a higher regard for the intelligence
of the people than to suppose that they could be deceived by
the show of reform merely He did not áe^ire gentlemen tobe
too eager—ton over zealous—he did not wish them to did into
matters which were rather small and by means of which no
leat or substantial good could be effected
Mr. BRIGG§ was opposed, he said, to the amendments be*
