dee's communication of yesterday reached me at 2 this morning. I have moved my command to this place as being a better position. The Texas Rangers are encamped at Woodland; the infantry half a mile this side; Swett's artillery in wood at Middleton's, and Phifer's battalion in wood on Mammoth Cave road, just below this place. I have parties out in the direction of Mammoth Cave, Bear Wallow, and Frederick, to protect the agents of Bruce &amp; Co. in collecting beeves, &c., and to collect and drive in what they may overlook. I find it difficult to get more forage than is necessary for my own command without using infantry for that purpose, which would scatter my force too much. I keep a party of observation constantly thrown out towards the enemy, and think I will certainly be apprised of any attempt to cross in force. Any such attempt might be successfully resisted if my force was upon the ridge at Rowlett's Station, and I will probably be able to march them up in time from here. This is a much better region for forage and nearer to our supplies.

Very respectfully,

T. C. HINDMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Advance.
