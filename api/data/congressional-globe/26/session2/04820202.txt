26th Cong-"«1st Sess.                                        Pre-emption Bill—Mr. Fulton.                                   ______           Senate.
lands of Mississippi? The people even ot the o d
States could see into the justice of this. Mr C
would be willing to appeal to them, he was ready
to make them his judges But the appeal came too
late, judgment had been already pronounced upon
the Senator—not by Mr C. but by his «onstitu-
ents, as well as by all the Senators representing the
new States.
The Senator had talked about the effect of this
bill in reducing the public revenue, which he repre-
sented as most ruinous, but did the honorable Sena-
tor forget that he had himself voted to distribute
the entue revenue among the Stated Would that
have no effect m impoverishing the Treasury' Mr
C denied the Senator's position m all its beanngs
But it was most manifest that the Senator's own
scheme of distribution was open to the very objec-
tion he urged against this bill in a still greater de-
gree. The Senator seemed to hive forgotten the
policy he had himself been -dvocating and urging
on the country for the last eight or nine years Mr
C it seemed, was already judged by the Senator for
truly representing the interests and sentiments of his
constituents He was not willing, however, that
the Senator from Kentucky should be his judge on
that subject he was not responsible to him The
Senator had imputed to Mr C the warring against
the interests of his own State, when, m fact, he was
but obeying her voice
As to General Harrison, did the Senator doubt
that he was pledged, both by his votes in ihe Señale
and by his letters since, in favor of pre-emption and
graduation? Did the Senator doubt thi*? At one
time, in 1838, the Senator had a tery distinct im-
pression on that subject When injurious epuheis
had been «sed by the Senator against the pioneers
of the wilderness, the friends of General Harrison
had deemed it necessary that they s lould speak tor
him as to his views on that sjbjeet, and the editor
of the Commercial Bulletin, a piper published m
Missouri, adverted to a letter ot General flamson,
which was very laconic and to the point, -inting
that he was in favor of pre-jmptun, ¿nd had al-
ways been so When Mr C reíd the letter he was
gratified, and he presumed that he need not assure
either the S nate or ihe gentleman from Ken-
tucky that this avowal, together with his foimer
votes in favor of graduation and pte-tmption, went
v«y*far toward obtaining f >r General Harrison the
amount of votes he had received It hid been
very truly said by the honorable gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr Buchanan] that ihe professed
friends of General Harrison here were at variance
with the votes and opinions of General II himself,
and yet they complained of Mr C and his friends,
who were engaged in an efioit to establish, in ad-
vance, the very principle which the coming Presi-
dent avowed Mr C could not see any plausible
objection to themeasuie, ii meiey allowed honest
settlers to take up a small quantity if land, in pr -
erence to speculators and rich monopolists, who
would otherwise get possesion of the lands and
hold them up from sale
Mr CLAY ot Kentucky said he would add but
two or three wordt in reply Nothing was funher
(said Mr C ) Irum my purpose, in what I said
when last up, than to intimate lhat the worthy Se-
nator from Pennsylvania,my chairman in tho Com
mittee of Foaign Relations, did any thing impro
per in accepting th<¡ offer of his late mission to Rus-
sia, far, very far from it I k low what was ins
standing with his party, which no doubt induced
the oifer ot such an appointment, nor do I doubt
that, in accepting it, he yielded to the earnest and
pressing soliciiations c Í his worthy chief, a forn er
President ot the United Sutes I said that the mo
Uve which led to th  eulogy pronounced by him on
General Jackson wa? a sense of gratitude, and this
feeling must doubtless have been greatly increased
by the circumstances to which he rpferred Be-
sides, a foreign mission, and that a mission to Rus-
sie, is not a thing to be sneered at No d< ubt the
worthy Senator, m fulfilling his distingu sued ap-
pomtment, may have suffered much m hi  'armly
affairs, and his separation from thc-e to wnom he
may be bound m tender ties, and it he went, it ws
merely to oblige his friend and patron, who urged
the appointment upon him
A word to the Senator from Alabama He sa>s
that I have been coidem ed n my views of policy
by all the nine new landed States Ah' the Sena-
lor no doubt is very correct' What says Ohio?
She has b en anxious for the policy I advocate for
these eight years past The Governor, in his mes
sage to the State Legislature, sanctions and recom-
mends it What says Indiana? Her Legislature
is in favor of my distribution policy by a majority
of sixty votes, and Missouri is not much behind
her And I now predict that, when that measure
shall be presented to this body, there will be scarce
a Senator from the new States but will be in
favor of it, recommended as it is by all just and
generous principles and considerations which ad-
dress themselves to the mind ot a patriot and a
statesman
Mr CLAY of Alabama explained He had re
ferred to the opinions expressed by the new States
during the fifteen years last past He mignt have
been mistaken as to Ohio for a few years In the
existing state of ihirgs there, placed, as she was,fin
the h ds of a party openly opposed to gradua-
tion, the friends of ihe present bill could entertain
no hope.
The question was now put on Mr Hunting-
ton's amendment, restricting the operation of the
bill to two years, and dec dtd by yeas and nays as
follows  Yeas 22, nays 22
The President of the S nate voting in the nega-
tive, ihe amendment was rejected
SPEECH OF  MR. FULTON
01   ARKAlvSA^
In Sfkate, Monday February 1, 1841
The bill to establish a permanent prospective pre-
emption system, in favor of settlers on the public
lands, who shall inhabit and cultivate the same and
raise a log cabin thereon,was taken up, the question
being on the motion ot Mr CRiracNDEffto recorrí
nut iht bill, with lnsiruotions to report 1 bill for the
distribution of the proceeds of the sales Of the pub-
lic lands among ihe Sta es, which Mr Yodno had
proposed to amend by a motion to substitute tor it
the bill ot Mr Calhoun, proposing to cde the
lands to the States within which ihey lie, upon cer-
tain conditions
Mr FULTON said he felt it to b- his duly to
say a lew words on the proposiiion just submitted
by the Senator from Illinois, [Mr Youno] to cede
the public lands to the Slates wi hin which they lie
This proposiiion had been, as he thought, very un
justly rejected some ume since, by a large majority
of the Senate, when it was (fTered as an amend-
ment by the Senator from South Carolina, [Mr
CaihoU"?] to the proposiiion to distribute the pro
ceeds of the siles oí the public Ian Is That S na-
tor hart nobly surrendered hi* pr jud ces upon the
altar of his country, an 1 cat te to the re>eue of the
younger members oí this Union He proposed to
relieve them from th  odio js condition of thraldom
and vassalage, mwhuh they have been hitherto
held by the strong arm ot power of this Federal
Government He had looked witn the eye of a
statesman upon the evils which have resulted from
the present system, not only to the new States, but
to this Government also, and which are increasing
to such an alarming exten', as even to threaten the
welfare and harmony of the Union itself He
therefore boldly came foiward with a piopisition,
calculafd to secuie the righ s of both the Federal
Government and toe new S'ate , and which, at no
dutant day, will be re„"rded b> aU Hip oldpr States
as the very best measure for securing their best m-
t-issts that was ever submitted o the consideration
ot Congress And jet, fortius great act, one oí
thf greatest of his li'e, the Senator fiom South Ca-
rolina had been condemned by a majority of the
S niters from the old Slates
Nothing, sir, but the dependent condit on of the
new States could have driven them to consent to the
terms upon which it is now proved to cede to them
the lands with n their limits The Legislature of his
State had instructed her Senators to support the mea-
sure now under con^iderauon and he was, iherefoie,
doubly bound to advocate thi* amendment, al-
though he did not believe that the- proposition was
as liberal to the new States as he thought it ought
to be As the subject was, in so many aspects, of
the first importance to the country and to the Slates,
he hoped he should be indulged with the patience
of the Senate, whiie he submitted his views in. re-
lation to it He could not boast of coming to the
consideration of this subject with impartial feelings
He acknowledged that he felt, deeply felt, the op-
pressiveness of the bonds into which his State had
been forced to enter when she was ¡admitted mto
Union He feared, therefore, that it would not be \
in his power to convince the Senate of the correct-
ness of the remarks he intended to submit. His
own convictions of the correctness of the conclu-
sions at which he had arrived, were such, how-
ever, as induced him to indulge the hope that he
could demon'tate that great injustice had been done
to the new States, and that instead of being con-
demned as untrustworthy and faithless, he hoped
to be able io prove, that they had been true to
their contract? beyond what even justice to them-
selves demanded of them
The Constitution of the United States never in-
tended that the new States, for whose admission
into th e Union it provides, should come into the
Union as mere dependencies, and j et, such is the
true situation, at this time, of the new States who
have been admitted into the Union The new
Sta'es are completely at the mercy of the Federal
Government By refusing to sell the public lands,
or raising the price so high as to prevent its sale, it
is m the power of Congress so to limit the revenue
of the new State  as to deprive them of the means
of suoporting their Governments, or otherwise
making it so burdensome upon the inhabitants as
to deter all emigrants from settling within their
limit Accoidingto the compacts made with the
new States upon their admission, the lands oí the
Federal G ivernment cannot be taxed by the new
States This is a cmplele denial of sovereignty,
and gives to this Government the entire mastery
over the new States That this power over them
has not been «o exercise! as to be intolerable, is
not because th' poser does not exist in this Gk>-
veriment under these compacts, but b°cause Con-
gress liar chosen not *o to exercise it as to have
palpably demonstrated its incompatibility with the
spirit and inter Hon of the Federal Constitution.
This Union was originally formed of free, sove-
reign and independent States They were each
acknowledged by Great Britain to be free, sove-
reign and independent, and, by vntue of that ac-
knowledgment, became possessed of all the pow-
ers and rights of distinct Government , and of ti-
tle to the soil wuhm their limits, the sime as Great
Britain had possessed previous to that acknow-
ledgment They were thus created sovereign and
independent States As such States, they entered
into the Federal Union, and formed iheir Federal
Constitution That Constitution gives to Congress
the power to admit new States into this Union.
Whenever Cingress exercises that power, she re-
cognises the State so admitted as a free, sovereign,
and independent State, precisely as did Great Bri
tain when she acknowledged the independence of
her colonies The Territories of the United States
are to the Federal Government what the colonies
were I o Great Britain They are dependencies, for
whom Congress has the power granted to it to make
all need'ul ruks and regulations Congress has
thp power to dispose of the soil, and to organize
thpm into Governments, so long as th*y íemain as
the territory of the United States But, the mo-
ment they pre acknowledged to be independent
States, Congress must necessarily part with all
power and authority over them, excepting such as
the old States granted to Congress over themselves
when they entered into the Union Tney
havp no longer any United States territory with-
in tneir limits, and Congas, therefore, has
no 'oager any right to dispose of any such
Territory " New States may be admitted by the
Congress into this Union " This is the language
of the Constitution What kind of States are
here contemplated to be admitted' Whv, sir, they
must be co-equals in all respects with those already
in the Union They must be States, as the old
States were, that is, States acknowledging no supe-
noi, owing no allegiance, possessed of every attri-
bute of sovereignty, and entitled to all the rights,
