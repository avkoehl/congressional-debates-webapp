LOUISVILLE, KY., September 18, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The Eighth Kentucky Cavalry just mustered out; many of them re- enlist, and there are now six companies. Will you authorize me to make it a cavalry regiment and order the ordnance officer to furnish the arms and horse equipments on requisition of General Boyle? I have conferred with General Boyle and he concurs with me as [to] propriety and advantage of organizing the regiment as cavalry. I hope to receive the authority from you at Frankfort on my return

there to-morrow.

THOS. E. BRAMLETTE,

Governor of Kentucky.
