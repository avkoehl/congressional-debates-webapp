HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Charleston, S. C., February 22, 1865.

Brigadier General JOHN P. HATCH,

Commanding Coast Division, Department of the South:

GENERAL: I am most anxious that you should reach here, so that I can put Colonel Van Wyck's brigade under the control of General Schimmelfenning. The One hundred and fifty-seventh New York Regiment, if not a part of Van Wyck's brigade, must be sent with it. If the reports from Georgetown by confirmed, a very small force will suffice for that diversion, and General Schimmelfenning will make it. I shall want the balance of your command very soon for operations elsewhere, and want them in good condition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Charleston, S. C., February 22, 1865.

Colonel Brown's regiment (One hundred and fifty-seventh New York Volunteers) to make a diversion to Georgetown; batteries at that place to be dismantled. Fourth. If practicable, Colonel Brown's force should then be sent up the Santee to the railroad bridge, to join General Potter; ascertain the practicability from the navy. Fifth.
