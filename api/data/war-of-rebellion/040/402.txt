Major-General SLOCUM:

The general commanding had received your dispatch without date. He is aware of the weakness of your line, and as that of General Couch appears to be the strongest, and one which the enemy will be the least likely to attack, he has directed General Couch to hold one division of his command in readiness to move upon the flank of the enemy without further orders in the event that an attack should be made on the front held by yourself and General Howard. This, however, he does not anticipate.
