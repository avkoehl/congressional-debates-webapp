HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Manchester, June 29, 1863-7.45.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 3.15 p. m. is received. The general commanding directs me to say that if there were any likelihood of the enemy's making a demonstration on you, your line, the prolongation of which would strike the railroad near Estell Springs,might be enfiladed by his moving around your left flank. He suggests it would be better position to withdraw Negley to Sutton's, behind Crumpton's Creek, holding the advanced brigade at Bobo's Cross-Roads, and Reynolds to Taylor's or Anderson's, holding an advanced force at Concord Church, and leaving Brannan where he is. The inclemency of the weather and the state of the roads, however, leave but little probability of his assuming the offensive. Please report whether Crumpton's Creek is still fordable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
