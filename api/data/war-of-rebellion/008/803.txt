General Rust, after assuming command, as heretofore directed, will cause all the Arkansas troops who may report to him to be organized into regiments after their arrival on White River.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. H. MAURY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT,Little Rock, March 25, 1862.

Colonel HENRY LITTLE,

Commanding First Brigade, First Division:

COLONEL: Instead of marching upon Jacksonport, as heretofore ordered, you will please proceed with your command to Des Arc.

The roads diverge at Springfield, and you will send your agents ahead to have supplies provided at points in the road between Springfield and Des Arc instead of Springfield and Jacksonport or Batesville.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, yours,

D. H. MAURY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DISTRICT,Little Rock, March 25, 1862.

Major W. L. CABELL, Chief Quartermaster:

It is now decided to make Des Arc, in place of Jacksonport, the point of rendezvous and deposit of supplies.

Keep the present force at Pocahontas, with supplies for thirty days. Direct the force there to make as much display of strength as possible. Have every thing so arranged that in the event of its being necessary they can certainly fall back on Jacksonport without being cut off. Have thirty day's supplies for the troops now at Jacksonport, and let the balance of every sort of supplies be collected at Des Arc.

By order of Major General Earl Van Dorn:

D. H. MAURY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, Miss., March 26, 1862.

Major General LEONIDAS POLK,

Commanding First Grand Division, Army of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: You will order Brigadier General W. W. Mackall to repair forthwith to Madrid Bend, to relieve Major General J. P. McCown of the command of that post and of all the troops there collected, as well as at Island Numbers 10.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
