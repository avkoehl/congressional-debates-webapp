western Virginia to bring the horses in the service of the Government back to this section, and thus consume the forage is essential to the wants of our armies elsewhere, it is manifest that most serious detriment to the public service must occur.

Knowing your disinterested patriotism, not only from your public character but also from a personal acquaintance which I had the pleasure of having while we were both members of the old Federal Congress, and your full and entire devotion to our cause (which is not the cause of a State, but of the whole South), I have taken the liberty of addressing you upon this subject. I shall forward this to you after having referred it for the consideration of the general commanding this military department.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. G. JENKINS,

Brigadier-General.

GOLDSBOROUGH, N. C., January 28, 1863.

General S. COOPER:

I came up here this morning and assumed command. It is rumored the troops have embarked. It needs confirmation.

GOLDSBOROUGH, N. C., January 30, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

General Whiting reports twenty-four regiments on transports at Beauregard ready to sail, and 25,000 troops still in New Berne, under Sigel, to move by land.

WILMINGTON, N. C., January 31, 1863.

General GUSTAVUS W. SMITH, Richmond:

A portion of the enemy's fleet left Beaufort yesterday. Five steamers and seventeen transports passed Swansborough last night. Recollect that should they pass below me, either to feint or make a real attack on Charleston, Beauregard may recall his troops. Their presence, or at least and equal number, should be always here, and if you supply their place you must have more from the North. Sigel is at New Berne with (reported) twenty-five regiments. Greater part of the force at Morehead City and on board transports.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
