Tennessee five years He thought this term too short
The quantity of land offer eft for sale is very great,
something like one hundred and thirty or forty tm'-
lions of acres. Where so large a quantity of land
is in market, it cannot all be taken up immediately
That only which is believed to be worth more than
the minimum price of one dollar and twenty-five
eenb per acre, will be entered on speculation If
there is more land in market of the real value of
one dollar and twenty-five cents pei acre than is
wanted for settlement, and which is not of sufficient
additional value to be an object foi speculation, it
must, of course, remain, for a time, unsold And
the fact of its not being entered, cannot be íegarded
as an evidence that it is of less v?lue than the mi-
nimum price It will only pro c ihit there aic
other lands in market of gieater value, or which,
from their situation, are more desirable Our legis-
lation must depend on general punciples it cannot
be supposed that Congress can so adjust the price of
the public lands, with reference to quality and loca-
tion, as to produce a perfect equality, 01 to cause
the sale of the public lands to be made with equal
r? idity in all the districts
That lands should have been in market five years
and not taken up, would, no doubt, be evidence that
other lands were in market of better qualitj, 01 pre-
ferable location, but it would not piove that such
lands weie inferior and woilh less than the mini-
mum price
Time being the only evidence relied on to esla-
blish the interionty of the lands, he thought such
period should be required, as to settle the question
beyond "11 doubt
What, sir, are the grounds on which the gradua-
ting principle rests' It is not that it will operate
beneficially to the United States, that it will aid
the Treasury, but it is supported on the ground,
of its being just towards the States where the lands
are situated, and towards individual settlers who
may have purchased adjoining lands It is said to
be unjust to hold the public lands all at the same
price, when it mustbeapparentlhattheyareolgieat
difference m quality This argument seems to
assume that one dollar and twenty-five cents is the
maximum price, and that the difference iri qualilv
must be adjusted, by leducmg the price on the in-
ferior qualities But in point of fact, the entrv
price is the minimum price, or the avenge 01
medium puce But it is claimed that it is unjust to
hold the public lands atsuch'pnce ->s that thtv will
not sel1, that the settlement of the new States is
thereby retarded, and their resources for taxation
impaired, and individual settlers injured He ad-
mitted that there was great force in these icasons,
and was by no means opposed to tie pnncipleof
graduation, and only wished to be caul ous m its
application, and to be careful that, under the ap-
pearance of graduating the price of the publtclands
we do not necessarily disturb the land s> stem, and
pass a law for the reduction of the ¡nce'of the
public lands
He v, ould notice one other objection to the bill
as it is if so short a time as five )ears is estábil h
ed for the reduction of the price of tiie public
lands, will it not induce purchaser 10 firlcarl

price It apppired to him tint this would be the
probable result So that, instead of piomotw¿
the sale of the public lands, your gra luating prin-
ciple would delay their sale, as well as diminish
the proceeds He wished to disturb ihf present
system as little as possible, and did not think the
price ought lo be i educed, un il Ine lards had been
in market snch a length of lime, as should e labhsh
the fact beyond allieasonable doubt, lhat the lands
were of mfei qualit;, and would not sell at the

Mr CLAY of Alabama hoped that nei her hm -
self, noi these associated v ith him, would be ac-
cused of arrogance when the/ claimed io krou
more with regard to the public domain, and all ihe
circumstances connected with it, than those who

CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
fiom Connecticut was not aware of tho sifuation of
these lands when they were first brought into mar-
Jtet He would give an illustration from his own
'peisc nal knowledge In the county of Jackson,
Alabama, the lands were brought into market eight
veais ago, and theie were then two thousand voters
in the county, or fifteen hundred families Many
of these individuals took pre-emption lights, many
bought at the public auction which was held, after
which the lands wtie open Io every body at f 1 25
per acre Now, he would ask the gentleman if it
w as not fan to presume that, aftei the lands had
been culled by these pre emptions and auction
sales, the lemamder were not worth less than the
Government puce The gentleman must acknow-
ledge that these auction sales and pre-emptions
furnished sufhcient secuuty that the Government
could make no sacrifice m leducmg the price, as
the bill now pioposed What was the ease with
regard to lamls not suivejedi Theie were thiec
counties in his State which might be regarded as
new, and they contained a population oí not less
than fne hundied lamilies each Thu was the
luntoiy lately acqmud by hcalv from the Chetu-
kei Indians Now, was it reasonable to suppose
th if, in a distnct Ihus picked and culled by the sct-
tleis, and then at auction, aad aftciwards subject
to enttv loui vears, the lands could not be reduced
tuentv-five cents per acre without injury to the
Government* His fiicnels fiom Indiana, Arkan-
sas, and Missouii, who repiesented new States,
and km w the face of the country, and the manner
m which it was settled, could tell the gentleman
that no sales took place until settlement, and that
population always preceded the£survevs,asitwould
be impossible, without a military force, to keep the
seltleis from the fresh lands It nevei had been
done, and was not likely to be done now As to
the idea held out by the Senator from Connecticut
that an individual who wished to purchase would
postpone it for five 3ears foi the sake of getting
land at the reduced price, it had no foundation in
leahty Would any prudent man risk the loss of
a tract which he wished to purchase by letting it
remain open for five years, to be bought by any
bedy, foi the sake of saving twenty-five cents an
acie9 He thought not, and he put it to the honoia-
ble Senaior if he thought a tract was worth one
dollni and a quartei pel acre, an 1 wanted it, it he
would ri k the loss of it, by permitting it to remain
ops 11 subject Io entiy by any body and every body,
foi five yens He hoped the Senator would see
ihe propriety of withdrawing his amendment, and
if he did not do so, then he hoped that the Senate
w ou d disdgn e with him and reject it
Mr BENTON wished, when the vote was taken
on the intendment of the Sinalor from Connecti-
cut, to have the question divided lie thought the
period of five vears, as now in the bill, very ample,
uid oik tint allowed a very good opportunity

Mr. WALKER thought five and ten years a suf-
ficient criterion, bat if the Senate thought it best to
extend the time, he would prefer five and fifteen
years to eight and twelve He suggested to the
Senator from Connecücut whether he would not btr
avilhng to modify his amendment to that effect.
Mr NILES was unwilling to change his amend-
ment, believing that the extension of the time for
the first class of reductions, from five to eight
years, to be the most important.
Mr SEVIER hoped that his friend from Con-
necticut, who had stood by the squatters m many
a harel-fought battle, would not desert them now.
In the first place, this Government was the only
one on earth that ever undertook to make money
by selling land. On one side of us, Texas gives
her lands to the settlers who will go on them, and,
on the other side, in Canada, her Majesty, Qaieen
Victoria, gives them farms on the same easy con-
ditions At this very time, there were thousands;
of our industrious and valuable citizens, who were
induced to cross the river and go into Texas, be-
cause they could get land there for nothing, while
our Government would not sell it for what it was
worth. He had just received the information that
two of the counties of his State wanted te> give
themselves to Texas, and, indeed, he did not  know
but at this moment his State was engaged in a war
with General Houston, and all because the people
could get lands on better terms from the Texan
Government lhan ours But what he more parti-
cularly objected to, was the injustice with which
the new States were treated by holding the lands
up at more than they were worth, pnd keeping
them fiom settlement If the lands were offered
at a fair price, they would be sold, and be subject to
taxation by the State, and thus enable her to sup-
port the expenses of herGovernment He asked if
it was fair for this Government, in this manner, to
violate the compact with the new States He re-
gretted much that his State had ever relinquished,
the power of taxing the Government land, and, fo 
his part, he would rather have remained out of t'lie
Union a few years longer than consent to it If
fhe State could tax the Government lands, he ven-
tured to assert that they would not long he kept
out of market, for they had there a very effectual
mode of dealing with speculators when they got
them subject to taxation Give hs, said Mr. S.
the taxmg power over these lands, ¡>„nd you may
Ihen keep them up as high as yt>a please He
hoped that his friend from Connecticut, who had
stood by him so long> would coma to some com-
promise, and modify his amendment.
Mr NILES replied, lhat after the very feeling
appeals of his friend from Arkansas, and taking
into consideration also his magnanimous course the
other day on the duelling bill, when he was so wil-
ling to suffer martyrdom on that floor, he could not
refuse to make some concessions to him in the way
of a compromise, and he would therefore be wil-
ling to grve him one year, and make his amend-
ment read seven instead of eight years
The question was ihen taken on striking out the
word five, and inserting seven, and lost—ayes 17,
noes 19
The question was next taken on striking out ten
and inserting lwelve,andlos' without a division, and
Tbe question was then taken on striking out all
after the word acre, as in the tenth line, which wa*
also lost—ayes 15, noes 19
The effect of these questions was to leave the
bill m the shape of Mr Grundy's amendment, as
printed m Ihe beginning of the debate
Mr LYON then offered an amendment, which
was to ^íve to the States the right of purchasing at
a reduced price the refuse lands withm their limits'
but withdrew it after some remarks from Messrs
CLAY of Alabama and LINN
Mr CLAY oí Kentucky hoped that,, from the
importance of the measure, the Senate would con-
sent to let it be over for two or three days From
the votes taken to day, it appealed that not more
than two-thuds of the Senate was present, and here
was a measure the effect of which was to legislate
away hundreds of millions He suggested that
sufficient progress had been made m the bill for
the present, and as he wished to address the Senate
on it when there was a full House, he trusted that
