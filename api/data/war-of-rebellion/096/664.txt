A. P. Hill's corps seems to be held in readiness to move at short notice. I don't find any changes except the relief of Cowand's brigade, Grimes' old, by Cox's the former taking the latter's camp. Please let me hear from you before dusk how many deserters you get, and what changes, if any.

One brigade of Grimes' division is sent weekly to the right of Pickett's line. Two deserters from Cox's brigade say that a sergeant from the division reported that the three remaining brigades on Swift Run are under marching orders, with four day's cooked rations. Evidently that division is kept in readiness to move at a mement's notice.
