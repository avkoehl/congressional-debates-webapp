FORT SUMTER, May 16, 1864 - 1 p. m.

Very pretty little engagement just terminated. At 11.15 a. m., two monitors moved up and opened fire on east angle and face; Sullivan's Island immediately replied, and after an hour's sharp fire drove them both off. Each of them was struck several times, and one evidently seriously injured; pilot-house torn to ribbons. On leaving both showed as signal pennant colored white, red, and white. The usual slow fire Morris island has been resumed. No one hurt and no damage done.
