Carolina. However, we will do the best we can, and after a few trials may become proficient in attempts of this kind. I am quite sure that, with proper arrangements, Fort Sumter can be taken at any time. I have received the prisoners, and the vessel is anchored under the guns of the Wabash, where she will remain until the prisons are prepared. These will be located in the most exposed position near Fort Gregg.

Very respectfully and truly, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-I inclose you the latest secesh papers received.
