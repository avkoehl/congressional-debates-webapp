(Received 9.35 a.m.)

WAR DEPARTMENT:

I have some ammunition on my hands here. Having no transportation to furnish the troops on their arrival here en route to the army, this surplus ammunition was left behind. I omitted in my dispatch of midnight May 17 to say that the attack by guerrillas was made at 3 p.m. yesterday. I did not receive the information until 11 o'clock last night, by Captain Nicholls whose command was attacked and his guide wounded. Mosby is dressed in our uniform.

Two hundred and fifty cavalry (Eighth Illinois) are on his track.
