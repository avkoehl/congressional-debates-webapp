I will make a reconnaissance in force to-morrow toward Holly Springs. Will not attack or advance, however, unless it is ascertained that the enemy are evacuating, until re-enforcements are up. Will have the railroad complete to Davis' Mill on Monday. I have not the slightest apprehension of a reverse from present appearances.

LA GRANGE, TENN., November 9, 1862.

Two divisions and 1,200 cavalry are now out on reconnaissance toward Holly Springs. The cavalry, under Colonel Lee (Seventh Kansas), had two skirmishes yesterday in which they took 102 prisoners and killed 17 that they know of. Our reported loss 2 wounded. Rebels commenced evacuating Holly Springs last Thursday, but Pemberton came up and turned them back. This army should be supplied with 15,000 muskets and accouterments, complete, of uniform pattern,delivered at Jackson, to supply recruits and replace arms requiring repairs. This number would enable us, by making some changes, to have more uniformity of caliber in the different regiments. May I expect forces from New Orleans and Helena to co-operate?
