HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General GREGG,Commanding Cavalry Division:

The commanding general expects frequent reports from your command, as it is important to know everything that may throw light upon the position of the enemy and of his detachments. That the enemy is not at certain points may be as important to know as that he is at others.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

P. S.-The signal officer reports that 2,000 infantry went into the intrenchments from the Weldon railroad this morning. It is probable that you will find the cavalry at Reams' Station, supported by infantry. Colonel Wyatt's, a few miles above Reams' Station, is the point where the infantry brigade picketing the railroad is said to be posted.

GENERAL: I have sent six regiments and a battery to Reams' Station, distant three miles and a half; forward and to Proctor's, if possible, 900 men. These commands have just started. I have two regiments and a battery at this point to support either command if necessary. At the bridge over Warwick Swamp three mounted pickets only have been seen. I will hear from my command frequently and will report as required.
