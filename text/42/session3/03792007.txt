Mr. CO BURN. I ask unanimous consent

the present time the bill (S. No. 166) for the

jutant general of volunteers, for commutation
of quarters and fuel, three months extra pay
under the act of March 3, 1866, $1,085 out
of any money in the Treasury appropriated
for the pay of the Army.
Mr. BECK, of Kentucky. I have no par-
ticular objection to this bill, but I object to
anything being done until there is a quorum
here.
The SPEAKER. Then nothing is in order
except a call of the House.
Mr. BECK, of Kentucky. I think the less
we do now the better.

redemption and sale of lands.
On motion by Mr. KERR, by unanimous
consent, the bill (S. No. 1627) to amend an act
entitled "An act to provide for the redemp-
tion and sale of lands held by the United

taxes and for other purposes," was taken from
the Speaker's table, read a first and second
time, ordered to a third reading',; and was*
accordingly read the third tiinfe, and passed.
6RDES OI BDSINE®.
The SPEAKER. The Chaiir .will make a
suggestion to the. House, if geatlemen Will
give .their attention, that way facilitate the
transaction of business. It is that consent be
given to business on the Speaker's table, to
take up the bills thereon in their ordex, none
to be passed except by a two-thirds vote ; a
great many bills will be passed by unanimous
consent. If a two-thirds vote is not obtained
by a division or tellers, then the bill to be .laid
aside. In that way it is probable that every
bill can have its test inside of an hour and a
half.
Mr. HOLMAN. I hope that will b®done.
Mr. HALE. No yeas and nays to be called.:
The SPEAKER, ,It is not expected .that
under this arrangement any one. will permit a
bill to pass to which he is opposed, without
calling for the yeas and nays if-he desires it,
for that is his constitutional right. But when
a bill is reached, if it fails to geta two-thirds
vote, by tellers or upon a division, it is not
expected that its friends will insist upon call-
ing the yeas and nays, but that it will be
returned to its place on the Speaker's table.
No objection was made, and it was ordered
accordingly.
The SPEAKER. While the Clerk is arrang-
ing in order the- business on the Speaker's
table, (it having become somewhat disar-
ranged,) the Chair will entertain propositions
from the floor.
