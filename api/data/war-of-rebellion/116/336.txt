General H. W. HALLECK, Commanding, &amp;c.

GENERAL: On the subject of your note just received touching the claim of a prisoners of war to his horses and saddles and private property I fear I can give you no rule as settled. The practice in Mexico was I think to regard such property having been used in was as public and not private. General Scott neverheless, rather as a compliment than from the recognition of a claim, returned the carriage of Santa Anna taken at Cerro Gordo. I will take leave to say that I should be disposed to consider a return of such property a matter of momplaisance, and would return it or not as circumstances might seem to make it expedient, not recognizing a claim to it.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

E. A. HITCHCOOCK.
