Those in Alabama and Salisbury are approximations, as changes have been made by the officers in command in Alabama and North Carolina which have not yet been reported.

A report has been called for from each of those places, which may be looked for very soon. The prisoners captured in the West and Southwest have never been reported here and I know nothing of them.

The list of paroled prisoners as far as heard from will be ready to-morrow.

Respectfully,

JNO H. WINDER.

Brigadier-General.
