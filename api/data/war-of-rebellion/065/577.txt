able to meet and whip them. Our people are calm, no undue excitement, and I am glad to say no such feeling of panic manifested as was shown here last fall when similar reports reached this place. I will advise you of everything that happens, by each succeeding mail, worthy of communicating. My private opinion is that the enemy will not attempt to penetrate thus far, but have prepared to meet him if he does.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. D. ASHMORE,

Major, Commanding Post.

P. S.- I have communicated with Major Melton and Governor Bonham and asked for a company of artillery to be sent to Walhalla. They will communicate with you by telegraph, I presume, before this reaches you.

A serious difficulty is on even of explosion in relation to time of service of First Regiment South Carolina Artillery. Question in issue was presented for action of my superiors in papers of Private W. R. Logan, December 7. Early answer important.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF S. CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., February 8, 1864.

SOLDIERS OF THE DEPARTMENT OF SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA: The return of service of some of you is about to expire. You must have observed from the newspapers of your country that your brothers in arms of the veteran armies of Northern Virginia and of Tennessee have re-enrolled, as was to be expected of such men, by entire companies, battalions, regiments, and brigades, proudly retaining the organizations intact under which they have won renown. Will the men who have defended Forts Sumter and Moultrie and Battery Wagner fail to follow these examples of soldierly patriotism?

G. T. BEAUREGARD,General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., February 8, 1864.

Brigadier General W. B. TALIAFERRO,

James Island:

Colquitt's brigade will proceed without delay to Savannah to report to Major-General Gilmer after review. Nelson's battalion will report to you from Sullivan's Island.

Chief of Staff.
