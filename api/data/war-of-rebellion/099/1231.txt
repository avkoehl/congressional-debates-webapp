CHESTERVILLE, February 20, 1865.

General HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

Governor Vance and General Bragg are confident of being able to put your whole command at point designated in much shorter time than by dirt road. Reserve wagons and artillery might go to Cheraw by rail and thence by common road to Raleigh. Your sick had better be sent to Cheraw.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

I am ordered by General Beauregard to Greensborough, N. C., via Wilmington. He directs me to call upon you for assistance and information. Will it be practicable for ten days to go by Wilmington, and what are the difficulties in passing Cape Fear River? Answer at once.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

General Hoke states: "Assised by a few* brigades from you we may succeed in forcing the passage of your forces by this point. " If you need any assistance from me I will send you troops as soon as I can get trains. Answer.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Charlotte, February 20, 1865.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

I am shipping stores from this post as fast as I can get the transportation for them. Unless the enemy is checked much stores will be lost at this post. The prisoners at Salisbury should be marched at once to Greensborough. The Federal officers at this post I am sending to Greensborough on the passenger trains, stopping all private travel.

W. J. HOKE,

Colonel, Commanding.
