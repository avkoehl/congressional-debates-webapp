Major-General HOOKER,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

There division have been more or less engaged all day. Early this morning one division advanced on the Somerton front, driving in the picket, but was promptly repulsed, and our picket-line was intact at dark. Some fine skirmishing by Colonel Foster's light troops and Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry. On the rear or water-line, Anderson's force of 4,000 was held back by the gunboats and land batteries. The attack was vigorous and the result gratifying. Expect they will make a grand attack to-morrow. Longstreet has 35,000, some say 38, 000, and from one hundred to one hundred and fifty pieces of artillery.

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Longstreet's advance division arrived in my front on Saturday, and was followed by Pickett's, Hood's, and Anderson's yesterday. They advance about noon on the 12th on my front and right flank, within extreme artillery range, and after much skirmishing, fell back several miles. Early this morning they advanced on my front and rear, with one division on the right flank. More or less artillery fire all day and much skirmishing. Colonel Foster's light troops handled the enemy's, advance roughly, driving them back, and relieving the picket-line at dark. Anderson's division has been engaged on the water-front with our gunboats and batteries. The firing has been brisk and the enemy suffered. The command is in good spirits and will do its duty.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
