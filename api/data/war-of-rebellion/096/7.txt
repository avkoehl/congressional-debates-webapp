Major-General.

FORT BRADY, VA., January 1, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General H. L. ABBOT,

Commanding Siege Artillery:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report no firing. The mine at Dutch Gap Canal was exploded at precisely 4 p. m. to-day. There was no perceptible shock and but little noise; should not have noticed it had I been looking in another direction. Not a ripple in the river was created at this distance. Am fearful that the experiment has proved a failure; have no positive information with regard to it, however. General Butler and staff, and Senator Clark, of New Hampshire, were here to witness the event.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. H. PIERCE,

Captain, First Connecticut Artillery.
