direct to Stevensburg; thence toward Doggett's; thence about 1 mile to a place marked "Ruins," at which point an officer will be stationed; thence the road will be marked by men stationed along the route to the plank road; thence along the plank road to Germanna Ford. The Fourth Division, followed by the Second, will proceed from Culpeper, keeping along the south side of Mountain Run, to Stevensburg; thence on the main road toward Shepherd's Grove to a place about 2 1/2 miles beyond Stevensburg, marked "Ruins" on the map; thence to the right, over a road to be marked by persons on the ground, to the plank road; and thence to Germanna. These divisions will be careful not to cut into those they may find on their left, moving in the same direction.

The Artillery Brigade will at midnight move direct to Stevensburg; thence on the main road toward Shepherd's Grove to a place marked "Ruins" on the map; thence to the right, over a road to be marked by persons on the ground, to the plank road; thence to Germanna Ford. It will have precedence over the Fourth and Second Divisions, and follow the First and Third (each division having its train with it). Whenever the country will permit of different columns approaching each other, they will continue moving in parallel lines. The brigade will take wagons enough to insure five days' forage, one wagon for sales to officers, one wagon and spring wagon for brigade headquarters, one hospital and one medicine wagon, and half its ambulances. No other wagons will be allowed. The rest of the train of all kinds will be sent to the vicinity of Brandy Station, to make up the corps train, which will have an especial guard.

The men will carry three full days' rations in haversacks, three days' bread and small rations in the knapsacks, and three days' beef on the hoof. Care will be taken that no fires are built along the route, nor any unusual ones in the camps, as these may inform the enemy of our movement. The troops will cross the bridge at Germanna Ford as fast as possible, move out and eat their breakfasts on the other side, and then continue the march to Old Wilderness Tavern, taking up position there as fast as arriving, the First Division moving up the turnpike, toward Mine Run, about 1 mile. Each division will take half its own ammunition and half its ambulance train, one hospital and one medicine wagon for each brigade, wagons for five days' forage, and one wagon for headquarters of each division and brigade, and the wagons for sales to officers. No other wagons will be allowed.

The infantry will take 50 rounds of ammunition upon the person, three days' full rations in the haversacks, three days' bread and small rations in the knapsacks, and three days' beef on the hoof. General Griffin will detail a regiment of about 400 strong to guard the trains remaining behind;* the quartermaster in charge of these will send to Colonel Owen, quartermaster Fifth Corps, in Culpeper, for instructions. Division commanders will give instructions to all their officers to prevent their men from building fires along the line of march, or any unusual ones in camp, so as to indicate to the enemy our movements.

By command of Major-General Warren:

Assistant Adjutant-General.
