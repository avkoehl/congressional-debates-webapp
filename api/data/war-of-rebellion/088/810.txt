HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, September 13, 1864-10 a.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report all quiet on the line of Second Division since last report. Last night strong scouting parties were sent to Lee's Mill and toward Wood's Shop. No enemy discovered at the former place. Beyond Wood's Shop and toward Ream's Station fires were seen which indicated the camp of a regiment of cavalry. I had dismounted men concealed well in front of my line; but none of the enemy approached, as on previous nights. General Kautz was instructed to send out a strong scouting party toward Disputanta and Union, and thence around to Prince George. No report received of the operations of this party. General Kautz's line is much annoyed by dismounted guerrillas at night. These men lurk in the thickets for the purpose of stealing horses. Night before last a small reserve near Davenport Church was surprised by a dismounted party of the enemy; six horses were stolen and one man killed. Increased precautions are being taken on that portion of General Kautz' line to prevent surprise and to destroy these small parties of the enemy.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Second Division.
