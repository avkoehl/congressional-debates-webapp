WILLIAMSBURG ROAD, May 19, 1864 - 9.30 p. m.

General B. BRAGFG,

Richmond, Va.:

The cavalry scouts have just returned from Bottom's Bridge, and report that the enemy has destroyed that bridge and also fired York River Railroad bridge across the Chickahominy. He then left in the direction of Crump's Cross- Roads. The scout thinks the enemy have gone to Tunstall's Station, designing to rejoin Grant by passing through Hanover County. The railroad communicating with General Lee might also be injured by them on their return. I shall be able to inform you in the morning definitely the route taken by the enemy.
