The disposition is general to submit to the Federal Government in consideration of the mild policy proposed by Lincolm, especially if there be no truth in the many rumors of French recognition and armed intervention. hancock, in command of Federal force in the lower valley, invites all the stragglers, &amp;c., of the Army of northern Virginia to come and be paroled on the same terms those were that were captured at Appomattox Court-House, saying they may remain undisturbed at home. Many are disposed to go and seek this parole. We rode to Brownsburg, and spent the night with Dr. Morrison. Pleasant day. Rode fourteen miles.

Tuesday, April 18.-Went on home, via Summerdean, where we dined at Dunlap's. Got home about dark. The Soldier's Aid Society of Churchville had just adjourned as I got there.

Loncol's proposition for Virginia to come back as she was, &c., has worked a revolution in sentiment. Pleasant day. Rode thirty-two miles.

Saturday, April 29.-I went to Staunton. The Federal troop, about 800, came in at 2 p. m. and went into camp west of town. They were very quiet and disturbed no one.
