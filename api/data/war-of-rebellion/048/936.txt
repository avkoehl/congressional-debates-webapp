If it meets with the general's approval, I will start back, at 10 p. m. on the 16th, via Winchester, all the wagons I can spare. If an escort could start from Charlestown at the same time and relieve my guard at Winchester, they could follow me up the valley and look out for my rear. Colonel Body reports the map wrong, and that there is no pike from Berryville to White Post, where it is laid down. He says the road is bad by that route and for 6 miles almost impassable, and that I cannot get through there with the train. I shall, therefore, be obliged to keep the pike by Winchester. If I can get the train down to reasonable dimensions by main anxiety will be relieved.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding.

BURMACH, THREE MILES FROM BERRYVILLE,

December 11, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report my arrival here last night with 73 wagons and a forage train in addition expected. I shall encamp to-night a mile or two this side of Winchester, and reach Strasburg to-morrow about noon, if no resistance is offered. There is a mingling of hail and rain in the atmosphere, and the command is jolly under creditable circumstances.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WINCHESTER,

December 12, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report my command here last night. All well. Eighteen miles from here to Strasburg, making the whole distance 48 miles. Have not seen Colonel Boyd, but learn that he is ahead.

I would much like a guide who knows the country above Strasburg. No one in the command knows anything about it, and I want one who knows, too, how to get from the valley to Moorefield, as in certain contingencies I should dodge out there. There must be men in Martinsburg, and perhaps in Harper's Ferry, who have lived here and know all the roads and by-roads. It might, possibly, make the difference between saving and losing the command if you could send me such a man. Graham knows the country, and especially that party of it; if he were available in other respects, he would be the man. But there must be other scouts in Martinsburg who could be got. Command jolly, but foot-sore from these hard roads.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

GEO. D. WELLS,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain WILLIAM M. BOONE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
