GLASGOW, July 10, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I have the honor to report that on yesterday at Fayette I was present at the Howard Country meeting called in response to your appeal in General Orders, Numbers 107. Representatives from every township in the country participated in the discussion of the order, and their resolutions heartily indorsing your measure and pledging prompt and hearty co-operation with yourself and subordinates were adopted unanimously. On my return to Glasgow last evening, when about three miles from Fayette, I fell in with Holtzclaw's guerrillas and had and had a lively little skirmish, in which Captain Glaze, Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia, commanding my escort, was seriously, though not dangerously, wounded. Three of the outlaws will trouble us no more. When we attacked the party they had in their possession as prisoners several of Glasgow, whom they had captured an hour previous as they were returning from the Fayette meeting. During the fight the citizens all escaped unharmed excepting Colonel Clark H. Green, upon whom they fired, badly shattering his left arm. The prisoners then released were Messrs. English, Birch, Doctor Lewis, Captain Morgan, Colonel Green, Rice, Patterson. Howard County has only sixteen men in the Enrolled Missouri Militia organization. All others subject to duty paid out. I am expecting General Douglas here to-morrow with an exhibit of Enrolled Missouri Militia organizations in his entire district. we shall need every soldier that can be raised.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, MO., July 10, 1864. (Received 11th.)

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I will go to Saint Louis immediately after my conference with General Douglass and post you fully in a personal interview touching affairs in this district. For many reasons Glasgow would be the best place for district headquarters, but in my opinion it is inexpedient to make the change just now. Will give you the reasons for my conclusion in person, and then wait your conclusion and orders.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, MO., July 10, 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Say nothing to any one about General Rosecran's suggestion to remove my headquarters to this place. It is better that it be not discussed at all at Saint Joseph.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
