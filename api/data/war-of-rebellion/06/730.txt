recently from Washington, and learned from hit that he had been told by the Secretary of the Navy that a person near General Dalgren, at Pass Christion, was in close communication with the powers at Washington, had given them all the information that they wished, and had told them of our want of guns and ammunition in and near New Orleans. From the same source Mr. Walworth knew that extensive preparations were making to invade Louisiana early this fall. General Dahlgren is in command of a camp of Mississippi troops at Pass Christian, and has a brother in Washington, an officer in the Black Republican Navy. The Secretary of the Navy seemed well aware of our position on Ship Island.

Colonel J. K. Duncan, whom I sent to Ship Island in the absence of Lieutenant-Colonel Allen, has made a lengthy report upon the importance and capabilities of the island, and declares the place wholly untenable. His report, together with the opinion of Major M. L. Smith, chief of engineers, is transmitted herewith.*

I hope to have in operation within two or three weeks a powder-mill, now erecting at the barracks. This is my only real dependence for powder, and yet its success hangs upon an uncertain promise of a supply of saltpeter. I have but 120 rounds for each gun on Ship Island; at the other fortifications not more than 40 rounds. To send this supply I have almost emptied the magazine. If I can obtain ammunition I have no doubts of the result of an invasion in this quarter. I would respectfully suggest, in view of a very probable necessity, that a camp be established near this city as a rendezvous for troops. The assembling of men from their homes is a work of much time.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIR: I have the honor to inclose herein a report by Colonel J. K. Duncan upon the defenses of Ship Island, together with the opinion of Major M. L. Smith, Engineers. I have never been on the island, but every intelligent person whom I meet, acquainted with the locality, concurs with to the sound besides Ship Island Channel, and that small steamers and gunboats can pass through them without difficulty. I shall hold the island until ordered to relinquish it.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
