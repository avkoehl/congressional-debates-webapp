the regiment ordered be directed to join us at once. Our forces should be increased at least 2,000 men, in order to man these works; but 600 men have joined the garrison, and there are in all now total present 1,500, just reported by Colonel Doolittle.

NASHVILLE, TENN., October 26, 1864-10 p. m.

Brigadier General R . S. GRANGER, Decatur:

Your report of the 22nd instant gives the force at Decatur at 1,750 strong, and I have ordered two full and new regiments to you, which I had thought was sufficient to man your works. You must do the best you can with them. About the same number you report whipped an entire DIVISION of the enemy at Allatoona a short time since, and compelled them to withdraw with heavy loss. I will send you re- enforcement as fast as I can get them, but you must hold your position at all hazards.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, ALA., October 26, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Of the 1,750 reported on the 22nd instant, at least 350 are absent patrolling the river below and above here. This leaves only 2,000, including the Twenty-= ninth Michigan, which has arrived, as my whole effective force. The Fourth Michigan has not bee heard from Of course I shall make the best fight possible, but you must remember that our works here are much more extensive than at Allatoona, and 2,000 here is nothing more than 1,000 there. I feel great responsibility, as the place is of so much importance, and, if taken, our pontoons will fall into the hands of the enemy; because, even if drifted upon the other side of the river they old not be protected against him. my anxiety is not to render doubtful so important a point. We, if attacked, shall not only have one DIVISION, ut the whole of Hood's army, Rodeey, &amp;c.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER, Decatur Ala.:

Dispatch received. I have no troops at present to send you as a re- enforcement. A strong force of infantry at all the fords ad crossings will effectually prevent the enemy putting down pontoon bridges.

I have no fear but that you can defend Decatur, but I wish you to throw all the troops you can spare along the river to defend the fords
