HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS

WASHINGTON, Ark., DECEMBER 5, 1864.

Brigadier-General Boggs, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The withdrawal of Steele's brigade at the present time takes from me the means of executing at once the orders from department headquarters in regard to the burning of cotton. As soon, however, as the brigade of General Fagan's, ordered to rendezvous at Eldorado, on the 10th instant, assembles and organizes, I will do so. Care will be taken to respect the exemption held by the representatives of Messrs. Campbell & Co. I understand General Smith's intention to be that I shall burn all the cotton east of the Ouachita, except that of Messrs. Campbell & Co., inasmuch as General Smith can judge of its liability to fall into the hands of the enemy quite as well as I. The map shows the vicinity of the region of country to the Arkansas and Mississippi Rivers, both of which are now navigable by the enemy . I think also that there is no doubt that this cotton will not bear transportation to Galveston or the Rio Grande even if transportation could be provided by the holders. To carry out the instructions efficiently, it is necessary that the intention to burn should be kept secret as possible from the inhabitants in the regions that the cotton is found, for fear they may infer from the destruction of the cotton that the country will be given up, and take flight in a panic. I shall avail myself of the intermediate time to undeceive them in this respect, and to show that breadstuffs and not cotton are the only products to be cultivated, to enable us not only to hold what we have, but to regain what we have lost. I will impress upon them that necessity of cultivating the soil even in the enemy's lines, each man with the means, however small, he may possess, and will not destroy the cotton until after they shall have had sufficient time to be satisfied that cotton in exposed places not only affords a temptation to the enemy to visit their homes, but by its falling into the homes of the enemy will prolong the war indefinitely. In my proclamation it will be unnecessary to state that it is my present intention to destroy the cotton or at what time I shall do it.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,J. B. MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding.
