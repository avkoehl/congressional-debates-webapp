¿have und-rstood that, ia consequence of the reduction ol the
jtandioS army, it became necessary to withdraw two regiments
which bad been stall ■noj in Florida and the Southern States,
%ai to trans er them to the Northeast, and that it was the with-
drawal ofihese troops, and th- conseque it mab lity of the Go-
Ttrnmeni to strike adecisive blow at ttie ñut hostile indication,
which, in the opinion ot General Jesup, operated wuh other
causes to produce hostilities lie thought that the Indians
would not have taken up arms in the face ul a regular foiceca-
Cble of immediate action. Whether the reduction of the regu-
army, and the transfer of the Southern regiments, had any
influence upon the m «ds of the Indians or not, it is veiy certain,
I dunk, (hat the conduct of the President and Congre-s had a
powerful influence in producing the Flor da war. I will state
the facts which the records prove, and alte, you have heard
them, sir, I venture to predict that you will say General Jesup
•cas at least half right, U not entirely so, in his sta ementa on the
subject.
In 1823, the Government made a treaty with the Flondt In-
dians, by which they were to retire from the seacoast into the
interior of the peninsula. They were not to occupy (except
certain reservations) any lands mgher than twenty miles to me
shore of the Atlantic, and mgher than fiiteen miles to the Gulf of
Mexico
In May, 1833, at Payne's Landing, .he Seminóles cede all
daiats to land in Florida, and agree to emigrate west of the
Mississippi, provided the Creeks would receive them as a con-
stituent part of their nation. The Seminóles were to remove
to three years after the ratification of the treaty, and the re-
moval was to begin "as eaily as practicable in 1833, with those
Indians at present occupying the Big Swamp and other parts
of the country beyond the limits" denned in the treaty ol 1833
In March, 1533, the Seminole cluet-i sign a treaty expressive
of their sausfacuoa wuh the country assigned to their Ration
westof ihe Mississippi, and agree to commence removing to
their new home ' ass von as the Government will make arrange-
ments for their emigration satisfactory to the Seminole na-
tion"
From these treaties, it is clear that Congress ought to have
provided the means lor removing the Seminóles, and to have
commenced the work in l'vU, but, instead of doing so, the Go
vernment made no preparation, and appropriated no money
for that object until the 3d of March, 1835. Thus the Govern-
ment was culpably negligent in the fulfilment of irsob igauons,
and sorely have the people of the I'mied States been punished
for It. The delay was so great, ¡hat when we began te make
preparation-! to send the Indies west of the Mississippi ihey
■ml we bid trifled with and disregarded the treaty so long that
they would not be bound by it. Hostilities commenced in 1S35,
and the next thing the statute book exhibits, is the appropria-
tion oftl20,00d, to oropel the Seminole* to submit. This ap-
propriation w s made on the 14ih ol January, H,b, since which
time we have expended about twenty millions in the prosecu-
tion of the war, and sacrificed hundreds of valuable lives, of
whom ten fell victims to the climate for every one killed in
battle1 Nothing like this war can be found in history. We
have had in the field Irom five to ten thousand troops, and yet
this mere handful of savages are not conquered. '1 ru ly may it
be said that 'the race is not to the swift, or the battle to the
strong " Sir, I regard the disasters ol this war as a just pun-
ishment for the criminal negligence of the last Administration.
President Jackson was so devoted to the personal glory of
electing his successor, that he could not attend to the fulfilment
of the Seminole treaties in proper time. His faithful followers
m Congress were as int ntly engaged in the same glorious
work' Alt were so engrossed with the ideas of "retrenchment
and reform," (which terms are now understood to have meant
from the beginning, in the party vocabulary, increase of the
expenditures una division of the spoils,) and the regulation of
the «accession, that no attention was given to the treaties with
the Seminóles. When the Indians exhibited their resentment
by refusing to emigrate, instead of approaching them in kind-
ness,icknowledgingour negligence, and offering to pay them
for thedisappointment and delay, the Administration gave or-
ders, like a gasconading bully, and resorted lo force A hun-
dred thousand dollars would probably have healed the breach,
if paid to the Indians in the way of damages for unjustifiable
delay in executing the treaty on our part But that could not
be done, because it would be an open confession of the faithless
nessofthe Administration ' Man will not take blame to him-
self, although he knows he Is criminal * Wei!, sir, we have
carried on the war neaiiy five years, and what have we got by
ill We have experienced the truth of the declaration from
Heaven, "When the wicked are in authority, the people
mourn "
But the gentleman from Pennsylvania reads the orders of
the Secretary of War to General Jesup, directing him to dis-
band a portion of lus forcf i, and complaining that he had called
out too large a force; and he read irom General Jesup's com-
munications, showing that he could not end the war, because he
was not furnished with troops at the proper time. I see in all
thimothing dishonorable to General Jesup All that any one
can say is, that be may have erred I am not willing to con-
cede that much. Before the Indians dispersed over the whole
wastry, it might hav% been practicable to put an end to hos-
Wiuesby a decisive blow. Had Jesup been furnished win
troops at the time mentioned by him, he might, for any thing
we know to the csntrary, have given that blow Since the
Indians scattered, it has been impossible to strike them. One
fourth of the men we have had in Florida, under General Je-
■up, would have put an end lo the war, in half an hour at any
line, if they could have brouuht the Indians to a general en-
gagement in an open field But the Indians would not meet
them in that manner. The Indwns dispersed and scattered
through their swamps and hammocks How, then, were they
to be caught? Not by following or seeking them hy large ar-
mies. As well might you call down the eagle from his azure
Might, to attack a tomtit in a brush heap as well might you
 et a pack of bloodhounds to catch bu'lfrogs in a Florida pond,
«sto march large armies after single Indians scattered through
••thousand hammocks. IfGeneral Jesup's object in cal ling a
largeforce into the field was to keep them together, and march
them by regiments in pursuit of the skulking foe,I should think
hi  plan a miserable om-; butifit was to divide them out into
"nail detachments, and cover a large extent of country, and to
hunt the Indians m seeming parties, the plan was reasonable,
aM deserves our approbation Did he call for more troops
Wan were necessary to cover the country with scouting parties?
no, sir.  We have been told in this debate that large bodies of
Indura liave lam snug in a I ammock, without detection, be-
tween the para lei unes ol i tr marching armies as they passed
oneitherside Now, sir, theie are 45.UUÜ square miles of Wil-
derness n Flouda, within the hiding places of each of which
the Indians may shelter themselves and if you had a man for
each square mile, even then tneie would he i o certainty of find-
ing the toe. Did Jejup call lor 45 OJJ men, or the hall of them,
or the fourth ot them?   No, sir
Mr Chairman, this Florida war will never end until we cease
to make war upon the character ol ourgenerals—until we cease
to expectlmpossibin íes at their hinds We must, moreover,
adapt our operjtions io the charactci an mode ol warfare of
the enemy. We must hunt him and fight him by small scout-
ing parties, and by sinale men, and we must do this systemati-
cally The conduct oi the Government has made it a war of
extermination The In bans so regaid it, and we must prepare
for it accordinglj When Gen Jesup th >uglu he could make i j
a lasting peace with the IikImhs, by allowing them to retain a
partnl the teintoiv, the pieseni Atumnisirauon w mid not lis-
ten to his proposition, but recalled hun, and I am not certain
but it was done in consequence of this proposition After
wards, Gen Macomb was bent out with power to treat, and he
reported that he had made a verbal bargain with the Indiana,
by wnich they agreed to stay on one side of Pease creek, and
he on the other, anu fight no moie Well, sir, this bargain
was not observed by the Indians It is now a war of extermina- \\
tion, and how sha II we bi ing it to a c use'! The Indian wars of
the "dark and bloody ground" give the necessary instruction,
if we were but wise enough to receive and obey it Sn, we
must cover Florida wuh o d fashioned log foils, within which
twenty or thirty men can defy the attack of every Indian in
Florida. I have made the calculation, and I find that less than
one hundred of these leg to ts would cover the peninsula of Flo
rida in such a manner as to leave no one ol them more than 25
miles distant liom tho c ntghest to it Five thousand troops,
being abnu'half the number *e have usually kept in the ser-
vice, would supply a garrison of 50 men for eacli fort Now,
sir, if you wish to en1 the Fionla wtr by killing or capturing
the Indians, build such foits all ov i the cointiy about 25 miles
apart, beinsan easy day's march on I iot fiom the one to the
other Station at each 50 men, not mt. i without spirit, or cha
racier, or activity, such as aie f.1, ked up in the filthy lanes and
gutters of large cities bu men who are bold arid active, le-
spectable and aspiring, suchas may be had in our mountains
and plains, if you w li adopt proper moans to obtain them 1 et
these men, in scouts ol  ix, or a dozen, or two dozen, hunt
through the swamps and hammocks between the forts. Let
them meet on half way ground and encamp all night together
Let them exchange visit  an 1 tell their adventures Let them
fight whenever they could do so on equal term , and when they
muldnot, retreat to their forts for protection, and take mea
sures io concentrate fiom the diflerenl points a force sufficient
lo meet'aiiy mimberofthe enemy which may embody Let this
system be adopted, and you will bring the war to an end in the
moil economical manner possib e nuch a system would soon
discover all the h ding places of the enemy, ail his resources,
and he would either fill under the blows which would reach
him, or sutren ler in despair But, instead of adopting a sys-
tem like this, we have emertaineJ the vain desire of conqueung
Indians as we wouid civilized nations—by eplen id campaign*
and pitched battles, in which we were to reap a harvest of glory
and renown, and we have avenged ourselves for the disappoint-
m ut by abasing our generals '
The gentleman from Pennsylvania read a letter rom General
Jesup, in which he says he woul 1 employ bloodhound , if the
inhuman massacres of the savagescould not bearrested with-
ont using such means. I thought, when the letter was first
read, that the General was to be rua 'e answerable for the in-
troduction of the dogs now operating in Florida, but, as he
made no recommendation to engage the services of such auxili-
aries, aud as no reflections were cast on him in the course of
the debate, on account of his allusion to the bloodhounds, Isee
no motive in reading that part of his letter, unless it be to furnish
the groundwork of prejudicial lnferemes, although no com-
ments are mal1 upon it Now, sir, I feel, ab Geneial Jesup ex-
pressed lumsc f, tha> if there were no other means of saving
the lives of women aud chi aren from the scalping-knife and
tomahawk, or of avenging their murder than the u e of the
bloodhound, I would employ him I will go even fuither and
say, il there are other means, but not so effectual, I would use
the bloodhound Savages, who are not governed by the rules
of civilized warfare, who gibbet then prisoners; who pay no
respect to a flag of truce, ( he melancholy fate of Colonel
Hardin and Maj Trueman is ample proof on ti ese poin s,) who
spare no age nor sex, who murder and bum at midnight, must
be made to feel the vengeance of ihe civilized man, by the ut-
most seventy They cannot be taught to s ay their murderous
hands until ihey feel that destruction awaits them. 1 hey have
no sympathy foi their enemies The shriek of the victim is
music to the ear of a savage Such being the nature of the
fiend we must encounter, I look upon it as a sickly, mawkish
sensibility.to weep il heis throttled by a blaodhound, when we
should rejoice if lie was trampled to death by the charger of
the dragoon The true philanthropist and Christian laments
the calamities resulting from war, and does all he can to
avert them, but, when Isee one so very refined in sentiment
as to exult without b mnds when a squadron uf hoises or ele
phantsare so managed as to trample the enemy to death, and
to pneve themfeelves without measure at the idea of hunt-
ing the lurkins foe wuh a pack of dogs, lcmnit helpiegard
lag such person as of wt-al. mind, or hypocritically ctnung
upona d sanction wilhoul a sub lanual difference Genuine
humanity adopts every meina to put an ei d to war as speedily
as possible. With savages the suiest way to end a war, or to
keep them in peace, is t > convince them that they canootescape
your vengeance, and that thfy will always receive justice at
your hands Give them cor fi lence in jour honesty, and mal e
them know that they can be caueht and , unisfied, ana you will
have no difficulty wi'hthem Tha' mister spirit of lie world,
Napoleon, quelled a mob by pouung u¡ on ihern a shower ol
balls, without previous notice The lalung ofa few killed pro-
duced a panic, and the multitude dispersed immediately
Otheissenttodothe same thing, got the passions of the multi-
tude exi Hed by firing l> ankcattndges upon them, and when it
b came necessary to use bal n,hundreds were slain before the
mob was dispersed. True humanny is always consulted by ne-
ver trifling If dogs could I e found to track and take the In- ,
diana, it would be humanitv instead of cruelty to u«e them, '
because the conviction thereby produced on the minds of the j
Indians that they could not escape, would bring the war to a
speedy termination.   As it is aud has been, your efforts to drive 11
them from their fastnesses have been like firing blank cartridge 
upona mob; you have only incensed them, and made them
moie resolute.
Now,sir, 1 look upon the employmei t of bloodhounds m this
Florida war with great con'empt, simply because I have not a
particle of confidence in the efficiency of that kind of force It
is, like all the other 'experiments of the past and ptesent Ad-
mmistiauons, a failure The dogs have not earned their rations'
And then the instructions given as lo the manner in winch they
were to be used are supremely ru'iculoja' The soldier must
follow the dog, which slowly follows tlie Indian trail, being re-
strained by a leash' And thus dog and man are'both shot, be-
lore either sees the Indian'
It is the most difficult thing on earth to discnminate in cases
seemingly analagous You might make a successful hunt of
naked Indians in the time of Cortez and Pizarro with blood-
hounds; but the) <vill not seize Indians with rifles and toma-
hawks in theirhands 1 am yet to be convinced that theblood-
houn Is will stand before fire arms if, however, the people of
Florida can, to any extent, protect tiiemM Ives by usjne blood-
hounds orany other kind of dogs, 1 shall noi blame them for do-
ing it. The dog is our protector under irany circumstances.
He keeps a faitnfui waich around ihe < mien at midnight He
warns us of the appioach of the 'htf He is the hunter's
friend He helps him in his wars upon bear and buffalo; and if
he can be made serviceable in ihe Florida war, I shall shed no
crocodile tears for political effect
The colonial authorities of Mass-ichuset's, in 1744, declared
war against certain Indians, and offtred rewards for their scalps.
One hundred pounds (bills of credit) wciciobe paid for each
scalp ot a male Indian, over twelve years old, killed in battle;
and half that for those under twelve years, and for women
killed in battle One hundred and five pounds were to be
paid lor Indian male prisoners over twelve years old, and fifty-
five pounds for women, and children under twelve jears old,
made prisoners So our Puritan ancestors made only five
pounds difference, for hum inity's sake, between living and
dead Indians I do not find that the Indians were not to be
caught with bloodhounds The reward was to be paid to all
"who snail voluntarily, and at their own proper co~t a d
charge g i out and kill," &c 1'eally, bir, it might be a saving
to the Treasury to lei nut the Tlor'da war upon such term"
We have already paid more than $'¿000 for every Indian and
negro, male and female bieand little, in hostile array in Flori-
da, and we have only ki led and taken, so far, about a fourth
pait of them At the same rate, by ihe time we kill or catch
ihe whole, each man, woman, and child, will cosí us about
«10 000.
In 1764, John Penn, Lieutenant Governor of ihe Colony of
Pennsylvania, issued his proclamation offering premiums and
bounties for Indian prifoners and scalps, and did not ¡ rohibit
the use of dog  of an) sort One hundred and fifty Spanish
dollars, or pieces of eight, weie to be paid for male prisoners
above ten years old, and one hundred and thirty dollars for
squaws and girls, and boys under len For ihe scalp of each
male Indian above the age ol ten years, one hundred and thirty-
four dollars were given, and fifiy dollars for each female scalp
above the age of ten year* I mention these things to show
what has been done by respectable communities in defending
themselves asainst savage enemies Now, although I would
prefer following other examples, and taking prisoners and
scalps without any fee oi reward, except that of saving the
country and protecting our wives and cmldr n, still, in looking
into the past history ol Massachusetts and Pennsylvania, I think
the Representatives of th se highly respectable and Christian
Commonwealths ought not to condemn, with unmitigated se-
verity, the people ol Florida for seeking the protection of their
own scalps by the attempt io use dogs in attacking and hunting
a savage foe.
When 1 was under General Harrison in the Northwest, during
the last war with Great Britain, I was informed that General
Proctor paid the Indians a Btatetl toward for every scalp. That
was a crime It was a veiy different thing from paying mem-
bers of the same community for protecting the weak and feeble
against the toich and scalpin  knife, by killing, or car tunng, or
h unting the savage foe with dogs It was the example of a ci
v llized nation paying for and rewarding savage brutality,mstead
of teaching mercy andhuma ity ' It was a retrograde move-
me t which disgiaced ihe fast anchored Isle Instead of being
the leformer, she became the ally and encourager of barbari-
ans '
I have performed an act of duty and lustice in making these
remarks in defence of General Jesup, whose conduct has, I
think, been gieatty misunderstood and misrepresented. The
character of the country andol the army is identified with the
conduct of our generals, and I will not sit by and see them
sink—yes, sn, manacled and thrown ov aboard—when truihand.

Mi Speaker I had not mtrndi d to part ciwfle in th'S debate,
until my colleague (Mr Watterson) adtfessed the House,
some days ago Up to that Ufe. I h id fen no disposition to
submit my views upon the merits of this bill, not because I did
not appreciate the magnitude ard dmgerous tendency of tha
abuses which it is intended to reform, but because I was not very
sanaume in the belief that the bill, if pawed into a law, would
provean effective corrective of tho«e abuses And,  ITi" mf
colleague (Mr Watterson) had confined himseir in his re-
m rkstothequewonbeforetliellouse I vviuld not have changed
my original purpose, anrl would have been content to give a si-
lent voie up"n this question, as I have done upon most of those
which have been duposed of by this House But he chose to
wan ' roft fiom the question before the H >use, to give a history
of the late political canvass in the IState of Tennessee; ia_the
course of which, he felt himself called upon to animadvert, with
as much seventy as he could command, upon the course of the
political party in that State to which he is opposed, and to de-
nounce, in the most offensive and unsparing terms, two distm-
SmiW individuals of mat party But a little while ago, my
cnlleaVne was identified with that party in Tennessee which he
now^ooos^. and professed to he the ardent friend and admirer
