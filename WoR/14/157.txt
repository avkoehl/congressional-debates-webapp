Major-General McCLELLAN:

The last reports from Commander Rodgers were last evening, that he had passed Day's Point and Harden's Bluff, after heavy cannonading at both places. He started at 6 yesterday. The Merrimac and Monitor are at this moment approaching each other (11 o'clock a. m.), and will probably engage, unless the Merrimac falls back to Sewell's Point. No troops were landed there yesterday on account of her presence.

Merrimac came out about 3 o'clock. Out squadron - Minnesota, Vanderbild, and Arago - worked slowly down. Merrimac advanced toward Monitor, then turned around and went behind Sewell's Point, where our ships cannot reach her. She remains there to prevent landing of troops. Nothing else new.
