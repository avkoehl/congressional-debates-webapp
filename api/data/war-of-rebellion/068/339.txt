RENSSELEAR, IND., May 2, 1864.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Commanding Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: You will do me a favor, and one that would be gratefully remembered thought life, if you would do me the honor to give me command of a division in your corps, either white or colored.

I appeal to you, general, with a soldier's frankness, and hope that you will with a soldier's generosity
