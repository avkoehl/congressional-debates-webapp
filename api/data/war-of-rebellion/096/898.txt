Assistant Adjutant-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, March 8, 1865.

Brigadier-General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Cumberland:

I have a number of persons from Loudoun County here who came in last night. Mosby, with considerable force, represented to be at least 500 strong, was at Waterford last night. He is conscripting all the inhabitants capable of bearing arms. He is represented to have a light battery of four guns (doubtful). I am putting down a pontoon bridge, and think a cavalry force should be sent over there sufficiently strong to drive him from the country. I have only Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry; not reliable.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
