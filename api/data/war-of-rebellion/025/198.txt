HUMBOLDT, September 3, 1862.

Brigadier-General ROSS:

Messengers in from the force sent from Humboldt report the enemy between Brownsville and Middle Fork of Forked Deer River, at or near Cherry Bluff. Will you send a scout in that direction?

They are reported as infantry and cavalry. If infantry, they must have crossed 15 miles west of Brownsville, at Green's or Whitley's Ferry.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

IUKA, September 3, 1862.

General GRANT:

If we abandon this line it must be done with great deliberation. We have a large hospital here; commissary stores both here and at Eastport. Everything on the front must appear, if possible, exceedingly strong and have an offensive look. Don't let Granger move till we are all right and our stores and sick cared for. Will be down to see you by cars this morning.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General.

MEDON, September 3, 1862.

Brigadier-General LOGAN:

My pickets were alarmed by approaching cavalry. I sent out a squad of cavalry and infantry and they ran off. A body of about 100 on Bolivar road. I cannot say whether there are more or not.

JOHN D. STEVENSON

Colonel, Commanding.

General-in-Chief.
