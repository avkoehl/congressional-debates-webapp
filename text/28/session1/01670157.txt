* The specific duties in 1842, on these two articles, would
be a higher per cent, on their value in 1843 than those were
in 1828, as the value of the articles then was so much higher.
Several other articles might be added which are in a similar
situation.

Note.—All are necessaries, except spirits, and seme
kinds of silk; and all unfortunately happen to be rivalled
here—even spirits.
* But imports were less in 1843 than in 1840; so that they
did not yield over $17,500,0110.
f Must have declined, as silks are now taxed so much
higher than in 1840.
