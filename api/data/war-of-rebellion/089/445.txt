CITY POINT, October 31, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A week ago General Halleck informed General Grant that the Seventh Infantry was on its way here. Several days subsequent General Grant authorized General Dix to retain the regiment until further orders if it had not already left New York. We have heard nothing from it since, and do not know whether it is on its way or was detained.

OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

ARMIES OPERATING AGAINST RICHMOND, VA.,

October 31, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Scouts returned this morning from the extreme right, bringing communication from agent in Richmond to the effect that the only recent change in affairs in and about Richmond was the movement of 6,000 conscripts, on Friday last, from Camp Lee to the trenches in General Butler's front. Richmond papers of the 29th state that the enemy captured about 400 prisoners from General Butler on Thursday last and about 600 on our left. About 200 of our killed, it is reported, were left on the field. The general impression is that General Butler's movement was merely a feint and was understood to be such at the time. The movement on the left they consider of little damage to their cause. Nothing particular could be learned from the south side except from the Richmond papers. No troops have arrived on the north side since last report except conscripts, who are coming in quite rapidly. One out of every five of those detailed to work in the niter-works have recently been conscripted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. MCENTEE,

Captain, &c.
