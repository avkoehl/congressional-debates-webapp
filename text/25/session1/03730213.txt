in the vaults and calláis oí the bank The proportion ol the
rue of prices generally during the wat, aid oí fall since the
peace, not in Ln?land only, but in all other countiies from
these alternate opuations, may be ihfhcalt to estimate but it
mint b c nsideiablt and the more so, as othei couitnes, as
well i England had also a depierietecl paper, and have since
endeavoied to repl-sce it by a metallic cunency
In a speech, deliveied by him on tae 10th day of
Februarv, on tne bank chaiter bill, he said
' If the) wis! ed lor a projf of the vail e of a steady, un
chipg-Mble cuirency tí ey had it m th" oxarríple of Fiance
Tiat country hid been twice invaded, twice had her capital
b en ta ven p >seession ol, an 1 she had been compelled, m JblfJ
and 1317, to pav large 'sums to foreign coun'nes lor corn But
hire ha 1 a steady me dlic cunency and however such visita
turns might hat c effec e Í the gieat—however the extensive con
tractor might have been m urcd r ruined—the gi eat body oí the
populati m remai le 1 unmolested Tne storm which uprooted
the fore t tree had passed over wi'hout injuring the humble
reed, ani th.s was maní y to be attributed to tie permanent
foot mi upon which tne cunency of iheeoimtiy had been placid
1 If the plan of h s right 1 onorable fnend was carried into
execution, he was satisfied it would have the effect oí making
the country banker as sens tiveon the suojectof the exchanges,
ai t is watch! ul of any uniavoiable turn whichi i ghttake p ace
in them as the Bank of England now was He wouldcaielully
watch the cncuinstances which were calculate! to Lnn^goid
into, or send it out ol, the countiy, and this cauf ion being timely
impressed upon him the t'augei would in a measure, be passed
There woulu then oe no feat of any agitation or convulsion in
the coun ry, as the lnteiest of eveiy baukei would compel him
to piovide himself for any coming em^igency , in other woids,
every corn1 rybankti would led an equal mteitst with the Bank
cfE ig arid m w itclun" the state of the cunencj, and guaiding
against its fluctuations
"If, then it was necessary for the best interests of the country,
that the currency should be eslaolished on a sound and solid
foundation, an 1 that the ciuntry b nl s shou d be prevented from
draw ng the metallic cunency out of the kingdom, by (he issue
of thfc.se small notes, the next quest on was—\\ nether this w is a
pro "r tune ioi canying tne measuit into execution 1~Bat be
for-* he touched up it if peihaps it would lie proper that he

wis! ^d to savelhrse h inks themselves !iom tne constquences of
theiv own proceedings—from the liability of each to be ruined
IV the failuie ol the otheis But to effect tins they must be
prevented from l^uu g paper at low as he highest denomina
tionofthe metallic cuirency of ti e countiy They must not
b3 permt'te I to i suethen one pound notes—correspond ng w ith
the soverti3n—the highest de lonunation of me a lie currency
To give hein tt'e privilege ot making suchis-aes was m fact,
u permit tliem to assume the powers oí the pieiogatiye let
them ton iw to issue papei, and to extend an aci up m their
crt 11 but let them i ot issue the r sma I notes, and theicby
trt-ic'i upon the preiogative
In the same debates these opinions, were concur-
red in by mam other distinguished men, and finally
ptevailed 1 his bill, as I beíore íemarked, is in
strict accordance with the recommendations of the
late President, Mi Taney Mr Woodbuiy, the
Committee of Wajs and Means of 1834 before
refeirtdto and m tact was the leading policy of
the la'e Adm nitration To prove this and supply
arguments of more iorce and weight than I am
capable of urging, I quote from General Jackson s
message of 1834—Speaking upon this subject, he
savs
" Those ,niMutwm, [the State banks ] haie nlreaty shoten

the sevei al States shall be induced gradually to refwrn their
banking sij&tems, and prohibit the issue of ali small notes,

Utile liable to J ictualtons as any othei cammeicialcountry '
In Ins annual message ol December, 1833, Gen-
eral Jackson said

the earnings o 'abor, and do mere to levive and perpetuate
those habits of economy and simplicity which are so congenia1
to the character of repu > leans, than all the legislation wh ch
has yet been attempted "
This plan will so imperceptibly retrieve the pa-
per and introduce the metallic circulation as to
produce not the slightest shock or embarrassment
m the commerce and business of the country, or
reduction in the value of property Property, the
value of which has been regulated ty the present
currency "«ill retain its existing standard, and the
country gradually recover fl om its depressed and
ruinous condition
It may be argued that the full excess of paper
circulation will be kept up by the enlarged issues
of no'es oí the larger denomination—this cannot le
so The commeice and business of the country
can only bear a fited amount of circulation—all
excesses must and will be i educed—a fixed amount
of money can only be necessary to the commerce
and busme s of the country Of that fixed amount,
a> specie is enlarged so must paper be reduced,
and as specie is reduced so must paper be enlarged,
as the plan which I propose requires a mixed ctr
cu'ation of metal and paper, I propose to reach
such a proportion of the metallic, as will make cer
tain the comertibihty of paper into specie, which
vull always «eaire a sound currency These aie
the objects -which I have in view, and I confid ntlv
believe the scheme which I ha\e offered, will
effect it
Mr Chan man, this bill I firmly behe\t, with the
aid of some provisions which maybe attached to it,
adapted to the present emergency, is well eak ilat
ed speedily to remove the embarrassments of the
country Sir, as I have argued con/Mimci: is all that
is necessary to enable the ban! sma short time to
lesume specie pavments, this bill extends that con-
fidence, holds out to them a strong inducement to
resume, and promises a restoration of their fiscal
agent v on that resumption This, st, is better
than all youi penalties and all ) our dn olees
Mr Chairman, I \t ell know that to efect the ob
jeets of reform which all desire, the aid of the State
Governments must be invoked This aid I do not
doubt will be afforded not only from considentions
of patriotism but of interest for eveiy Sate is
deeply and importantly interested m securing a
sound currencj both as relates to their ovv n domes
tic concerns and their commercial co' rection with
the other States Thev cannot flcui ish— they can-
not prosper without it, and this is a guai antee that
as the errors m their systems develope themselves
they will correct them Sir, I do not doubt that
thoy ■  ill perform their duty to tbemselv es and to
the nation
Mr Chairman, I have heard much play, and
much emphasis upon the term AxioiceoiBank and
State It is calculated to call up those feelings of
abhorrence against the union of Church and State,
out of vv hich so much mischief to the lives and lib
erties of mankind has grow n, vv hich the peop'e of
the United Sta es so justlj entertain Sir, are not
these institutions the verj creation ot Goternm nt'
Did not Gov eminent impart to th°m form, substance,
and acfon and now vv e are to div orce the Go^ ei n-
ment from them' 1 know , sii, that these institutions
were created bj the State Governments jet, sir
unless all their powers are buried m the pow ers oí
thi Government iliev vv etecreatedbv Governments
having the power to do so This political connex
on so°mnch desecrated and abhorred in these lattei
davs, is as dangeious to the State Governments as
to i lis vet the State do not find it necessan to de
stioy their bankmg mstiait ans and I am sure, w ill
defend them against the re-kless vvai now v aged
agauis. them    Sir, this term dnoice willnot take
__^ouhad  is well talk oi a dnoice between man
and wiie whi'e the) are indisponed to it
One vto'd more in rclat on to the su pension of
specie , auacnts by the ban\s,u,s"¡ ovv the pioj-nieh
and wisdom of the measure    When the suspen
sion tooK place it was supposed bv m?nv   pi rhtps
bv most peisons, that upon itsb"mg known in Eng
land, there would be an immediate prosl alien of
the commereial credit of the United States, and, as
a consequence, the destruction of the houses m Eng
land, commonlv known bv the name of the Ame
ricañ houses    But no such thing happened    Con
fidence was not diminished but impiovcd     1 bev
saw the thing at once in its irue light—the) saw it
w as a measure ot relief to the merchants of the
Um'ed States, w hich w ould g  e them time to gather
m their resources, and finally make good their pay-
ments in Ei gland whereas, lfthe set ere pressure
necessary to continue tne payment of specie by the
banks, had been kept on, they must have been rumed
and through them the people who were in debt —
This vv as a sound view of the subject In addition
to this, the States continue to use them as deposito-
ries, and to receive their notes m payment of their
taxes Wht, then, should there be so much alarm
here?
Mr Chan mar, I admit that there are serious
ev lis connected with our banking system I admit
that there are crvmg and gnevous abuses, which
require to be corrected, and I will go as far as any
man in applying the knife and cutting these abuses
off Nor, sir, am I disposed, in the slightest degree,
to coun ten anee the refusal of the banks to resume spe-
eiepaymentsm aieasonable length of time s While
the countrj mav be disposed to endure thisstateof
things as long as it is necessary and proper, it will
not—it ought not—to bear a wanton and unnecessary
delay The foreign debl is lapidly extinguishing;
the elastic eneigy of the country is rapidly in-
creasing, and overcoming all embarrassments, soon,
very soon, all pretext will be removed for contin-
uing the suspension, and the banks will merit the
stern and withering lebuke of every patriot, if they
persist in their refusal Sir, my course upon the
present occasion is not dictated by any merest
w hich I take for the banks, separate and apart from
the people I only look to their interest and their
security, as connected with that of the people, so
deeply involved w ith tnem I consider the mteicst
and welfare of the people as deeply and materially
concerned, and their prosperity oncangered
I hav e thus, Mr Chairman, presented to the com-
mittee mi views of this deep, this vital, this tntei
estmg question to this m ion I have exhibited the
opinions entertamed by tne late Administration,
andthejprom nentfucndsof thepiesent, and, having
done so, confidently and fearlessly appeal to the
Amer can people, to determine w hether I deserve
to be stigmatized as a tiailoi, or shot as a deseilei
Sir, ¡f an adheience to the op nions heretofore en-
tertained by the hienda of the Admm strauon, ro-
w lthstandingthey have abandoned them, is desertion,
I am guilty, and I will meet the fate which aw aits
me v uhoutinuimur Mv opinions are unchanged,
and no lear of personal consequences shall change
fhem My eonsti'uems aie unchanged, so far as I
have learned, at anv ev ent, th<"V hat e not instructed
me to vo'e contrary to my former opinions, and
until thev do I w ill v oti a amst your snb-treasury
scheme, m spile of denunciation, oi anv othet con-
sequence which may follow I r°gard that scheme
as containing the elements of destruction tr 'h--
ptintv of the Goverrmcnt he right  of the States,
and the liberties of the people Sir, so obnoxious
is it to nr-, that al hough there is no constitutional
objection in the wav, I woiid inflri ely prefer re-
signing my seal here, to vo ins: fot n I do not
call m*o question the smceritv of gentlemen who
have changed but I pioiest, tl at because 1 c mnot
change also, I should be denounced
Mr Chairman if I am to be tried on a charge of
