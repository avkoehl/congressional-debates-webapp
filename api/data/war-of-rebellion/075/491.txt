GENERAL THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS,

June 15, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Rebel line last night reached from Kenesaw to Lost Mountain, its center resting on Pine Top Hill, considerably in advance on left or right. That position was abandoned during the night and occupied by Howard's corps this morning, and to-day Thomas has pushed their center a mile to the rear. McPherson at the same time pushed their right sharply, carrying first line of defenses in front of Kenesaw and capturing 300 to 400 prisoners. Johnston must accept battle on level ground to-morrow or retire to-night to the Chattahoochee, the last probable.
