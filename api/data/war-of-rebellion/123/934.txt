Washington City, D. C., December 2, 1862.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston:

I would be glad to have another artillery battery, but to be disposed of either to Banks or elsewhere as the service might require.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., December 2, 1862.

His Excellency Governor SALOMON,

Madison, Wis.:

Drafted men may volunteer for nine months into old regiments, but cannot have advance pay and bounty. The mustering officer has been directed to muster by companies, so that an officer can receipt for and distribute clothing to the men.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 198. Washington, December 3, 1862.

I. Mustering and disbursing officers are prohibited from paying any accounts for expenses incurred in collecting, drilling, and organizing volunteers prior to July 1, 1862, unless such accounts shall have been audited and ordered to be paid by the War Department.

II. The intent of paragraph II, of General Orders, Numbers 162, current series, has, in some instances, been misunderstood. It is not intended to forbid the payment of bounty, premium, and advance pay to recruits for the old volunteer regiments, viz, those organized prior to July 1, 1862, or to forbid the payment of bounty, premium, or advance pay to a recruit, volunteer, or citizen who may enlist in the Regular Army, unless said recruit has received said payment before, the object being to avoid paying the same individual twice.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEW YORK, December 3, 1862.

(Received 4.25 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

We are on board. Shall sail this afternoon. Shall touch at Fort Monroe.

N. P. BANKS,

Major-General.
