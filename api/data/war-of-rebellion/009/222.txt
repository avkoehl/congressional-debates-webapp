were captured in these works, many severely wounded. upon reaching the rebel intrenchments I was rejoiced to see our flag waving along the entire line of the enemy's works, General Parke's brigade having previously stormed and captured their center batteries and General Foster's their left.

At the commencement of the action I left Lieutenant-Colonel Clark with his right wing inside of the enemy's intrenchments, ordering him to proceed along their lines toward their left, where General Foster's brigade was engaged, intending to support him immediately, but owing to circumstances previously mentioned was unable to do so. I was, however, confident that he would be able to extricate his command should he meet overwhelming forces, and most gallantly did he so; for coming unexpectedly upon a light battery of six pieces he charged and captured the entire battery, but was driven out by an overwhelming force of rebel infantry. I beg leave to refer the general commanding to his report of this most daring charge.

In this severely-contested battle both officers and soldiers behaved with distinguished gallantry and nobly sustained the honor of their respective regiments. It would make my report entirely too long to particularize the gallant conduct even of those officers and men who came under my own observation, but I desire that the reports and commendations of the regimental commanders be considered as part of my own.

It is with the deepest regret that I have to announce the death of First Lieutenant Stearns, acting adjutant of the Twenty-first Massachusetts, one of the most accomplished and gallant officers in the Army; of Chaplain Benton, of the Fifty-first New York, who was killed while nobly encouraging the men to do their duty, and of First Lieutenant Allen, of the same regiment, who was shot dead at the head of his company. Also Captain Johnson, who was killed in front of his company. Captain Frazer was wounded and captured in the battery taken by Lieutenant-Colonel Clark, but after it was retaken by the Fourth Rhode Island, and the rebels were retreating with him, he managed to keep in the rear, and drawing his revolver captured the three men left to guard him. Lieutenant-Colonel Potter, of the Fifty-first New York, was wounded early in the action, but he most gallantly continued with the regiment during the entire battle and rendered very important service. Major Le Gendre, of the same regiment, displayed most conspicuous courage until he fell severely wounded. Lieutenants Tryon, McKee, and Coddington, of the Fifty-first New York, also displayed conspicuous courage, and were all wounded, but not fatally. Of the Ninth New Jersey the following gallant officers were wounded, viz: Captains Middleton, McChesney, and Hufty.

I inclose herewith a complete list of the killed and wounded.* In the early part of the battle Lieutenant Reno, one of my aides, made a most daring reconnaissance of the enemy's right, and first informed me of the extent of their lines. They had thirteen finished redans and five guns bearing on my brigade, and an almost impassable morass filled with fallen timber had to be passed over before reaching them. Captain Neill, assistant adjutant-general, was always with me when not carrying orders, and displayed conspicuous courage and coolness. Lieutenants Reno and Morris, aides, rendered highly important service and behaved most gallantly. Lieutenants Reed and Marsh, of the Signal Corps, acted as aides and did their duty well. Captain Ritchie,
