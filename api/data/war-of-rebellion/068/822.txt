Major-General WRIGHT;

Have you made good roads between Jett's house and Beverly house, where Warren is? An officer has just told me your people are slashing timber between these places, and rather obstructing the communications. Please inquire into this.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1864. (Received 1.35 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Roads to the rear from Myers' house have been opened, and roads to connect that position with Warren's left were ordered and commenced yesterday, and I presume completed. Have sent to ascertain. The chopping referred to was in front of Russell's position. He was making slashings to strength his front.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 16, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Dispatch of 11 a. m.* just received. I had already pushed picket-line forward without opposition, and will now advance it till it feels enemy. From the Anderson house I can see plainly the rebel works in front of Warren's left and my right. At that point there are two lines of intrenchments.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
