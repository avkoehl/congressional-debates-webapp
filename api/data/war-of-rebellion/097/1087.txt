RICHMOND, VA., May 4, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN, or

Major-General CROOK,

Petersburg:

Information is just received that there is an armed body of rebels in Lynchburg which resisted a detachment sent there by General Meade. Also, that guerrillas are collecting arms and horses under orders of Governor Smith and the sheriff of Appomattox County. You will immediately send a brigade of cavalry to capture these rebels and their abettors and bring them to Richmond. Supplies can be drawn from the depot at Burkeville.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAVALRY HEADQUARTERS,

Petersburg, May 4, 1865-5 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Commanding Military Division of the James, Richmond, Va.:

Your telegram about sending a brigade of cavalry to Lynchburg has been received. Unless the necessity for doing so is great I beg that you will postpone the movement. All of the cavalry now here is much reduced in flesh and wants a short rest. If a brigade is sent to Lynchburg at the present time the loss will be serious in animals.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA, ARMY OF THE JAMES,Richmond, Va,. May 4, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Petersburg:

Lynchburg affairs are not so pressing as appeared at first. Still it is important that a cavalry brigade be prepared as early as possible. Transfer horses so as to mount it as well as you can and have forage sent out by rail for its use. A most reliable officer must be put in charge. Telegraph when it is ready. The Secretary of War attaches much importance to the expedition in discovering important matters. I presume the remainder of your cavalry can have ample time to rest and recruit.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
