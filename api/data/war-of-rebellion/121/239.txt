Honorable S. R. MALLORY, Secretary of the Navy:

SIR: The steamers Allison and Schultz, now engaged almost daily in the transportation of prisoners, are short of coal. It is of course very important that no impediment should exist in either sending off or receiving prisoners.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
