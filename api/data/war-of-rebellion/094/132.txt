Picket officers report no changes in my front this morning. But very little firing on the picket-line, probably on account of the inclemency of the weather.

What is the condition of the ground between the enemy's line and your own? Is it practicable for men to move about on it with facility? I would like your opinion about it.

The ground between the enemy's lines and my own is covered with a heavy sleet, which would make the handling of troops very difficult, if not impracticable. I am confident troops cannot move with facility.
