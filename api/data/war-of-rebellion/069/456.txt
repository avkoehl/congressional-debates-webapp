General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: Attack of General Wright's right has succeeded in gaining the enemy's first line of works. The left has been held in abeyance. Several hundred prisoners captured. They belong to Longstreet's and Hoke's commands. I saw and questioned them myself. the fight is going on actively and with no decisive results as yet. Have heard nothing positive as yet from General Smith. Prisoners think the main part of their army to be in this front.

Major-General WRIGHT:

Hancock will be withdrawn to-night, and will be thrown over to your assistance, if required. I am glad to hear the good news you send, and hope to hear of your continued success. Hancock has repulsed an attack, and Warren is doing very well in his attack. Sheridan was ordered to attack on your left, between Gaines' Mill and the Chickahominy.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,June 1, 1864-8 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

Everything is now quiet, but the enemy are fortifying across the direct road between me and the Chickahominy. I shall try to extend my left to the river to-night, but as I have not seen General Smith since the affair of the day was over, I can't speak positively. I will telegraph further as soon as I have seen him, and will give further particulars of the affair to-day. I think Hancock should be here before morning.
