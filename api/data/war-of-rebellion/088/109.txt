GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 10, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you send over to Dutch Gap a 3-inch rifle and a light 12-pounder Napoleon at once. You will send the men and an officer without horses to report to Major Ludlow.

Respectfully,

H. C. CLARKE,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

Order Captain Follett to send these guns with horses and proper number of men with three days' rations. Horses can be returned to camp to report at Crow's Nest.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 10, 1864 - 6.30 p. m.

General BIRNEY:

You will see that the following dispatch* is evidence that enemy propose an attack upon our party at Dutch Gap. Will you take measures to meet it? I think it will begin early in the morning, as the rams are to come down during the night. Perhaps you had better see Captain Smith about it. Please send this to him at once, with such remarks as you think proper.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Army Corps:

I have deciphered the dispatch.* It will read as follows:

Howlett's House:

Yours of 10 a. m. received at Signal Hill. Colonel Carter is here engaged in locating artillery at Signal Hill and Cox's overseer's house.

You will find both places on the map. Signal Hill is near Cox's house and Cox's overseer's house is about one mile and a half from our position, directly up the road from the gap. Please explain where it is to Captain Smith. Send over an aide to him.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

AUGUST 10, 1864 - 6.45 p. m.

General BIRNEY:

In case the enemy open, as they probably will do to-morrow morning, I would advise that all the guns at the Water Battery and the gun at Crow's Nest open upon the Howlett house; that the two mortars, with fuses too long to explode before the shell strikes, and try for the rams, if theory come down.
