as soon as the train gets me to Wartrace. It will not diverge from the line to Murfreesborough, except to find the enemy. General Ruger brings me reports from refugees coming into Tullahoma that their force divided in two columns at McMinnville, one attaching Murfreesborough, where it was repulsed, the other being the one near us, which is now supposed to have moved toward Fayetteville and may threaten Decherd or Cowan. I left the battery and a sufficient force at Tullahoma,; also at Elk River. I trust for no more delays now.

Wartrace was evacuated by order of G. Granger from Chattanooga by telegraph, directing all the forces to move to Duck River bridge and hold it. The delay in train it has been impossible to avoid.

I will investigate the matters spoken of in your dispatch.

Send up provisions.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

BEGGS:

I have received no orders for stores from Tullahoma. What troops want them?

DUCK RIVER BRIDGE,

October 7, 1863-9 a.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: Please direct Captain Blair, commissary of subsistence, to send up a train of supplies to this point, so that in case of necessity he can send here for them.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

STEVENSON, October 7, 1863-9 a.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

The post commissary has been directed to send 20,000 rations to await your orders at Duck River. In consequence of the protracted interruption of our communications, it has been deemed prudent to issue the two-third rations until further orders.

HOOKER,

Major-General

STEVENSON, October 7, 1863-8 p.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Let me know in what direction the rebels are flying. I am rejoiced to hear that matters are progressing so favorably.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
