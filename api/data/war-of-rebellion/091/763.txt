A regiment from the Second Brigade will be sent at once up the Middle road with similar instructions. Communication should be kept up between them. Direct the commanding officer to send in a report before daylight to-morrow. It is important the major-general commanding should learn the result of this reconnaissance as early as possible.

Brigadier General GEORGE H. CHAPMAN,

Commanding Second Brigade:

GENERAL: Pursuant to instructions from the major-general commanding the army you will send out one regiment at once up the Middle road to verify the report that there is a strong picket-line of the enemy established on the ridge on the south side of Cedar Creek. Direct the commanding officer to halt his main body this side the creek at Cupp's Mill and to throw a party across to penetrate the country several miles and to gather all possible information about the enemy's movements or whereabouts. Let him send in a report before daylight to-morrow; it is important that the major-general commanding should learn the result of this reconnaissance as early as possible. One regiment from the First Brigade is ordered up the Back road with similar instructions. Communication between them should be kept open.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,December 8, 1864.

Brigadier General G. H. CHAPMAN,

Commanding Second Brigade:

GENERAL: The officer commanding First Brigade pickets reports a strong line of the enemy's pickets south of Cedar Creek on the immediate heights since this morning. The general directs that you send word to your line cautioning them to be particularly vigilant, and instead of sending the usual patrol to send at least fifty men under a good officer on the Middle road so as to reach Cedar Creek by daylight. A similar party will be sent by the First Brigade on the Back road at the same hour. The general further directs that you send at once fifty men under a good officer to Petticoat Gap to picket will to the left and front of the gap until otherwise directed. The party will come in by 10 a. m. to-morrow. Direct the officer in command to establish his reserve this side the gap, and to send word in to these headquarters in case anything of importance transpires.

I am, very respectfully,

L. SIEBERT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
