Mr. HIBBARD. X wish to moke a parlia-
mentary inquiry. I submit whether the pend-
ing motion, being in the nature of a motion, to
postpone, is not out of order.
The SPEAKER. In what respect?
Mr. HIBBARD. On the ground that it pro-
poses to accomplish by a resolution that which,
in the form of a motion, would be out of order.
The SPEAKER. But the gentleman will
observe that this resolution requires for its
adoption a two-thirds vote, -whereas an ordin-
ary motion to postpone may be adopted by a
majority.
Mr. PL ATT. Mr. Speaker, what has become
of my motion to adjourn?
The SPEAKER. The Chair did not under-
stand the gentleman as insisting upon that
motion.

So the House refused to adjourn.
The SPEAKER. The question now recurs
on the motion of the gentleman from Tennes-
see, [Mr. Maykard.] to suspend the rules and
pass the resolution offered by him.
Mr. MO RE Y. I should like to ask the gen-
tleman to amend his resolution by substituting
Wednesday for Thursday.
Mr. ELD RIDGE. We do not agree to that.
The resolution was again read.
Mr. VAN TRUMP. Let me suggest an
amendment, that the Clerk be directed to get a
larger box than the one we have been using
heretofore in the drawing of seats.
Mr. PEIERS. Why?
Mr. VAN TRUMP. Rccauseitis too small.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Louis-
iana asks the gentleman from Tennessee to
modify his resolution so as to make it Wednes-
day instead of Thursday.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Let us vote down the
resolution ; it is all wrong.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. I desire to ask the
Chair whether an amendment is now in order ?
The SPEAKER. It is not, but the gentle- ■,
roan who offers a resolution, if there be no \
objection, is permitted to modify it. j
Mr. MAYNARD. I find that while I might'
oblige one gentleman I would be disobliging j
many others, and therefore. I do not consent j
to any modification, bat ask the vote be taken
on my resolution as it stands.

So (two thirds not voting in favor thereof) j
the rules wore not suspended.
Mr. STEVENSON. I move to suspend the
rules for the purpose of passing the following
resolution.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
1lesohed. That we recognize as valid and binding
all existing laws passed by Congress for the enforce-
ment of the thirteenth, fourteenth, and fifteenth
amendments to the Constitution, and for the pro-
tection of citizens in their rights under the Con-
stitution as amended.
Mr. RANDALL. Some of those laws are
unconstitutional.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I think we bad better
take those cases to the Supreme Court.
The House divided; and there were—ayes
86, noes 79.
Mr. STEVENSON demanded the yeas and
nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. This would seem to be
an appeal from the House sober to the House
druuk.
The resolution was again read.
Mr. NilSLACK. I rise to a parliamentary
inquiry 
Mr. DICKEY. Is it m order to move that
the House do now adjourn ?
The SPEAKER. It is.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I ask the gentleman to
modify his resolution so as to include^all the
laws which Congresshas passed during tne past
ten years, all now in force.
Mr. MAYNARD. If the House now ad-
journs, when will this pending resolution come
up again ?
The SPEAKER. At the close of the morn-
ing hour on Monday next.
Mr. COX. Where does the resolution come
from? It does not sound like good sense.
Mr. MAYNARD. When does the amend-
ment to the rules come up ?
The SPEAKER. It will come up as the
unfinished business to-morrow morning after
the reading of the Journal; but if it be not
concluded at half past one o'clock the bill from
the Committee on Education and Labor will
then, under the order of the House, cpmeup to
the exclusion of all other business.
The resolution, if not agreed to to-morrow,
will come up the next day, and must be dis-
posed of as unfinished business.
Mr. DICKEY. I misunderstood the effect
of the previous decision of the Chair. I had
supposed we would have had the whole of
to-morrow for it. I withdraw the motion to
adjourn.
Mr. KILLINGER. I renew it.
The question being put on the motion to
adjourn, there were—aye3 119, noes 65.
Mr. SPEER, of Georgia. I demand the
yeas and nays. I am opposed to adjournment
for once in my life.
On ordering the yeas and nays, there were—
ayes forty-four; more than one fifth of the last
vote.
So the yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken ; and it was decided
in the affirmative—yeas 105, nays 86, not voting

So the motion to adjourn was agreed to.
Pending the announcement of the result of
the vote, ,
Mr, AMBLER. It seems to me that we
must come to a vote on this resolution. There
is no object in taking up the.morning hour to-
morrow, and I suggest that by general arrange-
ment a vote be had at, two o'clock on \  ediies-
day. I hope that will be agreed to.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Ambler] asks that there be unani-
mous consent to taking the vote on Wednes-
day at two o'clock without dilatory motions.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I object.
Mr. COGHLAN. I desire to offer, for ret-
