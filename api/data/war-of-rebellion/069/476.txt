FARRAR'S ISLAND, JAMES RIVER,

June 1, 1864-4.30 p. m.

(Via Fort Monroe, 5.30 p. m. 2nd. Received 7.20 p. m.)

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

The concurrent testimony, which seems reliable, of deserters from the rebel army and navy, and contrabands from Richmond, is that the enemy meditate an immediate attack upon this fleet with fire-rafts, torpedo vessels, gun-boats, and iron-clads, all of which carry torpedoes, and that they are confident of being able to destroy the vessels here, principally by their torpedoes. I have not here, and am unable to fit torpedoes which are at all reliable, and would urge the Department to forward me with all dispatch torpedo barges and torpedoes, the latter with percussion fuses similar to those found on the Atlantic. In view of the novel attack contemplated I should regard it as imprudent to send the Tecumseh to sea now, and would request that one or more iron-clads be added to my force here, considering the importance of this river to the armies of Generals Grant and Butler.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.

CURTIS' HOUSE, June 1, 1864-6.15 p. m.

General BUTLER:

Please order stone ballast now at Bermuda wharf put in those vessels which I sent Captain Barnes there for this p. m.

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
HEADQUARTERS,June 1, 1864.

Chief Quartermaster, Bermuda Hundred, Va.:

Please send the bark Franklin and the fire shooters, which were brought here for the purpose of being sunk as obstructions, to Admiral Lee, giving them a tow with your tugs.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
