Colonel WM. PRESTON JOHNSTON.

Aide-de-Camp to the President, Atlanta, Ga.:

COLONEL: In answer to your communication of yesterday, I have the honor to make the following reply:

1st. That I have no enlisted men in my employ.

2nd. I have but one non-enlisted clerk in my office (James Pryor, aged twenty-five years), and he has placed a substitute in the field. F. M. Johnston, also non-enlisted, aged about forty-one years, is in my employ as a purchasing agent of quartermaster's supplies. I pay each $1,000 per annum.

My authority for the employment of these assistants exists in a general order of the Quartermaster-General to get up clothing, shoes, &amp;c., for the army. With the assistance of these gentlemen, I expect to obtain material to manufacture per annum-

Jackets or roundabout................................. 130,000

Pairs pants............................................ 130,000

Shirts................................................. 175,000

Pairs drawers.......................................... 175,000

Pairs shoes............................................ 130,000

Previous to the past month I have employed one clerk and three buyers, and may again find it necessary to increase the number of purchasing agents.

In this connection I have the honor to hand you the inclosed copy of a letter addressed by me to the Quartermaster-General, March 26, presenting more fully the details of my department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

V. K. STEVENSON,

Major and Assistant Quartermaster
