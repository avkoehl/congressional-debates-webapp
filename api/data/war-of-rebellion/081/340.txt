HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,June 23, 1864-11 a.m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I have sent to have the connection made between Russell's right and Barlow's left, and am ready to move my lines forward. I propose first to advance the skirmish line and then advance my main lines, keeping the connection with you. Is it possible to throw forward your left? It seems to me that it would improve your lines vastly as well as mine. Russell has an order to advance with and keep connection with General Barlow.
