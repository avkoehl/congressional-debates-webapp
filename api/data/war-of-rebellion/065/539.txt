A deserter, too, who was with the party that placed the torpedoes escaped from Battery Pringle by boat to the enemy, and it was supposed would give information that would defeat our object. This, too, was the opinion of the engineer who had the work in charge, and first suggested to me its discontinuance. If it is desirable that the work go on please inform me and details will be made accordingly.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. H. COLQUITT,

HDQRS. SEVENTH MIL. DIST. OF SOUTH CAROLINA,January 24, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded, for the information of the commanding general.

The Pawnee came up a few days ago near the obstructions and sent two boats up the river, it is presumed, to verify the localities of the torpedoes. She came up to-day very near the obstructions and shelled John's Island. It would be well if other torpedoes were put down, as the deserters have doubtless informed as to the exact points at which these are placed.

These traitorous scoundrels defeat the best of schemes. There are two more of the torpedo-boats ready and I will see whether we cannot get them to make the attempt on the Pawnee.

Chief of Staff.

When is General Rains going to try his floating torpedoes against the enemy's fleet in the main channel along Morris Island? It should be done as soon as possible.
