JOHNSONVILLE, October 4, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

What orders have you for my troops? My cavalry will reach the Tennessee to-night about Decaturville. I have no train. At what points can I find supplies after leaving the river?

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Nasville, October 4, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Johnsonville, Tenn.:

After crossing your cavalry to the east of the Tennessee River it will be better for you to move on toward Pulaski, and effect a junction with General Rousseau there, unless you learn that Forrest has moved off toward the Northwestern railroad, in which event I wish you to follow him immediately. From the best information I have, I believe Forrest is now endeavoring to make his escape across Tennessee River near Florence, and I have a DIVISION of infantry moving on that place directly from Athens, whilst General Rousseau will mvoe with his cavalry and mounted infantry along the Alabama railroad through Columbia and Pulaski. If, however, General Rousseau should learn that Forrest has gone in the direction of the Northwestern road he will also follow him.

Nashville, October 4, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN,

Johnsonville:

The first point at which you can draw supplis is Pulaski, then at Athens. The country is full of forage and you can get as much as you want from the fields. I presume your commissary can get plenty of beef-cattle on the road also. Since I dispatched you this a. m. I have information which leads me to believe that Forrest is moving south toward Florence. Get communication with General Rousseau as soon as possible in the direction of Pulaski and co-operate with him.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers,

JOHNSONVILLE, October 4, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

If you have important information in regard to Forrest's movements within the next twenty-four hours I wish you would telegraphed here and order it to be sent forwar to me by dispatch-boat. I start immediately up river.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
