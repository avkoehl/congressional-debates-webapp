UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, KANS., May 10, 1861.

Lieutenant Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

A. A. G., Hdqrs. Army, Washington City:

COLONEL: I deem it of sufficient importance to report for the information of the Lieutenant-General Commander-in-chief that I am credibly informed the governor of Missouri has established at Saint Joseph a permanent camp of State troops. The force now embodied and encamped and drilling consists of eight companies-one as light artillery, having two iron guns, taken from Liberty Arsenal; three companies of dragoons, and four of infantry. This force, by order of the governor, is to be increased from the interior. Should Missouri secede, not a doubt but offensive operations against this post will be attempted. At present I have troops sufficient to rebel any force now at Saint Joseph. If informed of additional ones arriving I shall, without hesitation, call on the governor of the State of Kansas for one or two regiments of infantry, to assist in the defense of this place and the towns on the right bank of the Missouri River. It is known there are stored at Fort Kearney large quantities of ordnance, ordnance stores, subsistence, and clothing, and it has been reported to me that the mustering of the State of Missouri troops at Saint Joseph is to make a sudden foray on Fort Kearney, to capture its stores, particularly the park of 12-pounder howitzers. Should I learn that Missouri troops have crossed the river oft this or any other object aggressive to the rights of the citizens of this State or interest of the United States Government, I shall with my disposable force, immediately attack them.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry, Commanding.
