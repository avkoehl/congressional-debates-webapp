of cavalry at Yellow Tavern. The entrenchments on this side of town are but feebly manned. There was a great excitement and fear in the city guarding our movements. He believes there are but few, if any, troops at South Anna bridge.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Ground Squired Bridge, March 14, 1865-4.35 p.m.

General MERRITT,

Chief of Cavalry:

My advance is without doubt in Ashland before this time. One detachment of my command has been within eleven miles of Richmond on the railroad, and not an armed rebel has been seen south of the South Anna. I would have no trouble in going within cannon range of Richmond.

Very respectfully,

G. A. CUTER,

Brevet Major-General.

Major General W. S. HANCOCK,

Commanding First Army Corps:

Referring to your letter of date 20th of February, recommending the appointment of Lieutenant-Colonel Morgan, of your staff, as brigadier-general of volunteers, General Grant directs me to say to you that there is at present no vacancy in the number of brigadier-generals allowed by law, and that until some vacancy does occur nothing can be done in the case.

Brigadier General E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I find two general officers (Sullivan and Max Weber) at Hagerstown awaiting orders. I understand that these officers were sent to the rear by General Sheridan. I have no use for them, as I do not want officers who my predecessor has found unsuitable after trial in an active campaign. I would like two good officers in their stead.
