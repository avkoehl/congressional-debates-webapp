culate the effects of the alarm that may ensue
But there is another pomt of view m n hich banks
appear to me quite essential to cur commercial
system It is that, according to the remark of an
excellent writer,* the appreciation of the credit of
a number of persons engaged in commerce, has
become a science, and to the height to which that
science is bow carried in Great Britain, (and in
this country,) that countiy is, in no small degree,
indebted for the flourishing state of its internal
commeice, for tne general reputation of its mer-
chants abroad, and for th" preference ■which, in
this respect, they enjoy over the traders of all other
nations.
Sir, I have been driven to this elementary way
of considering ihe subject, by the couise which the
argument ha* taken here and elsewhere, <md be-
cause, in solemnly review ing, as we are now com-
pelled to do, the whole monetary system of the
country, it is of the very last importance that the
subjeet,m all its aspect , should be fairly presented
to the people I shall, therefore, proceed briefly to
consider the question, how far it is practicable or
desirable to substitute a metallic currency for bank
papel, or even very materially to widen the metal-
lic basis of our present circulation
I presume it will hardly be disputed that, by a
general return to the precious metal*, as the only
medium of exchange for the whole commercial
world, the operations of trade would be every
wheie embairassed and impeded, and the value of
money enhanced, or, which ¡s the same thing, the
prices of commodities leduced in an incalculable
degree. How far asimilar effect has already been
produced, by the diminution of the supoly from
the Mexican and South American mines, within
the last twenty years, is one of the most diíhcult
and controverted questions of the da) This is not
a fit occasion for stating the arguments advanced
by the advocates of different views of that subject,
but I will mention to the committee, that in a very
able work, to which I have aheady referred as
having been recently sent to me, the author, who
examines this point with perfect candor, advances
the opinion, that thousands have, w ílhin the period
alluded to, been precipitated into e ibarrassments
from that cause alone f If it be true as is alleged
by Jacobs, that the whole stock of ce n in circula-
tion m 1829, was less, by upw ards of rGO,000,000.
than that which circulated in 1809 , and if ?nj
thing like the supposed diminution of the actual
quantity by abrasion, b) loss, b) consumption in
manufactures takes place, (one peí cent J a yeai,)
it becomes matter of serious speculation, whit
means shall be adopted to obviate so great an in-
convenience as a continually decreasing metallic
basts, at a period when commerce and its produc-
tive powers are so immensely on the increase. Sir,
that question is infinitely more interesting in a
highly progressive country, than in any other In
such a countiy, the currency niust be regularly en-
larged, with the growth of its •population and of its
productive power, or it is subjected to the most
terrible of all evils, falling prices Every body
that has ever treated of such subjects, has dwelt
upon the effects of an mcreasmg currency,
as wonderfully favorable to industry No more
striking example of this truth can be desired than
what was witnessed in the 16th century, after the
importation of gold andsilvu from America, began
to produce a decided effect upon the distribution of
wealth. It is admitted on all hands to have been
the period of the gieatest improvement m society
that has occurred in its history , and of all countries,
be it remembered, England benefitted most by the
general rise of prices, because so large a portion of
her farmers held leases for Ions terms of )ears, and
paid money rents , the inciersc of *hc circulat on
operating to reduce the real value of the realms
made to the landlord in favrroi hii tenant The
great benefit of a full and especially an i<m easing
circulation thus consists not onlv in quickening and
facilitating exchanges, (itself an immense stimu'ns
to industry,) but in secunngto the mdustnousclass-
es lather a larger prepmtion of die income of so-
ciety than they  would otherwise en¡oy    Every

thing which they buy to sell again advances in
pnce while it is m their hands, and this unquestiona-
ble truth is of itself a total refutation of all that is
said concerning the oppressive operation of bank
paper upon the productive clases* by the very per-
sons who, m the same br alh, speak of its excess
and deprec íation
With a population, then, met easing at the rate of
4 to 5 per cent a year, and with an accumulation
of capital and piodiwfive power propornonablv
greater. I hold it to be utteily abluid to talk of
any thing like a me'alhc currency m the United
States There is no pasible means of procuring it,
and if by means it could be procured, I ventuie to
affiim that our people would get rid of it m the
course of a few >ears, though all the penal laws of
Spam against the exportation of gold and siher
should be re-enacted here—]aws which weie passed
■k ith no other effect, even in that country, but to
show the utter futility of such legislation. I say,
s r, that with then present habits of active entei-
prise and strict economy, the American people
would export the precious metals as fast as they
were imported, beyond any amount of them which
might be absolutely necessary for the domestic ex-
changes of the country, and they would do so be-
cause gold and silver would be of no use ab'oad in
purchasing commodities, and would be wholly su-
perfluous at home where piper would do as well
If you put down " the hanks," it would have no
effect but to set up something woise in their phce,
in the shape of private paper There are some
things ovet which the most chspotic law givers are
unable to exeicise any control, and one of them, as
all experience shows, is this commerce in bullion
Sir, it has been said that the only advantage of a
paper currenc) o\er the precious metals consists in
its chrapness I am, by no means, as you may
gather from what I have said, ready to admit this ,
but supposing it to be true, is that saving really an
unimportant matter i Mr Gallatin, in a pamphlet
of signal ability,* has, I conceive, fallen into a grave
error on this subject, which it is so much the more
important to rectify, as I perceive that he has mis-
led otheis more disposed than himself to turn a
speculative error into a practical mischief He
states the whole benefit derived from the use of pa-
per instead of the precious metals m the United
States m 1830, inclu ling, under the name of circu-
lation, pin ate deposites in the banks, as tnev on"ht
undoubted!) to be, at about five millions of dolíais
a )ear It is true, that according to principles ad-
mitted by Mr Gallatin, the progress of the country,
both m wealth and population, m the last seven
years, would lequire a veiy considerable addition to
be made to this estimate in order to a eoirect appli-
cation of it to oui actual condition. But, sir, it ap-
pears to me that the estimate was made on data al-
together erroneous In the first place, the quantity
of currency, if it were metallic, necessary to the
circulation of this country, was prodigiuosly under-
rated Fui reasons that need not be stated here, it
is found that a given amount of metallic currencv
does not circulate as rapidly as an equal amount of
paper, and therefore, that more o<" it is, cent ns pa-
ribus, requned to do the ame business But with-
out going into such minute inquiry here, w'i) should
the United Stales, with siYteen millions of inhabi-
tants, and relatively 'he most active trtde both for-
eign and domestic in the world, and with extiaor-
dmary productu e pon e- of aU sorts, not need at 'lie
veiy least ha'f the circulation necessary in Tunee,
with only double ¡heir popa'alion and not half h"ir
industry' The stress that ou^ht to be laid on t'i s

least, 6,00,000,000 of dollars, an 1 acco-dmgly, as
wasobsei ved by one of my colleagues, (Mr Thomp-
son,) it is slated at that, on good authority^ Mr
Rothschild, in his examination before the Committee
of the House of Commons iri 1839, mentions the
paper circulation of the Bank of Prance as amount-
ing to 750,000,000 of francs. According to this,
then we should require on the footing of pupulation
alone, at least 300,000,000 of dollars. So much
for the amount, now for the loss upon it.
Mi G llatin considers it only as so much interest
on dead capital, and even the interest he puts at an
exceedingly low rate But I apprehend the differ-
ence to the country, between having a vast inert
mass of gold and silver as currency, and turnujg it
into productive capital, must be determinad, not m
refeience to intaesl meiely, but the profit of stock
laid out in active industry, which is no where in
this country less than ten per cent, and in the
great majority of eases, the new States and alhn-
cluded, nearly double that amount on an average.
You see, tóien, sir, what an enormous loss a metal-
lic currency would be to the nation, without taking
into account its wear and tear Look back at the
half century that has passed away, and say what
that loss would have been, on principles of com-
pound interest, from the beginning up to the present
day Why, sir, it exceeds all powers of calcula-
tion, na), of imagination. Do not suppose, for a
moment, that so important, so palpable a truth,
although never stated m abstract terms, os as a
general proposition, has not occuired to the people
of the United States They have felt it, without
petceiving it, they have acted upon on it, without
reasoning about it, the v have pel fectly well com-
prehended (he real uses of money, without studying
the principles of currency, and they have prefer-
red paper as a circulating medium, to gold and
silver, because it was better for their purposes than
gold and silver, on the simplest maxims of pru-
dence and economy. You may depend upen it,
this conclusion is as deeplv rooted as it is just.
You will ii8ver be able to shake it All your policy
will be of no avail, ai all legislation is lorevervam
wmch comes into conflict with the geniu  of a peo-
ple, especially m matters so deeply and visibly af-
fecting then private interest. The barbarian, who,
in his impotent rage, threw fetters into the Hel-
lespont, and scourged its foaming billows, did not
v a^e a more insane war against the nature of
things
But we are told that if it is an experiment that has
b >en proposed us, we need not be alarmed at it, be-
cause we are accustomed to experiment, and suc-
cessful «mes, that our constitution itself is a mere
experiment Sir, I deny it utterly, and he that says
so si ows me thai he has eithei not studied at all,
or studied to very little purpose, the history and
genu  of our institutions. The great cause of their
prosperous results—a cause which eveiy one of
the many attempts since vamiy made to imitate
them on this continent or in Europe, only demons-
trates the more clearly—is precisely the contrary
It is because our fatheis made no experiments, and
h?d ro experiment to make, that their work ha 
s'ood Thcv were furced b) a \ lolation of their
historical hereditary rights under the old common law
of lleiriace, to dissolve their connection wjth the
moil er country Then external, their federal rela-
tions were oí course cl a oged in that respect, and m
that respect only, the) were compelled to do their
best in thciovelsitua m n which they stood. What
rchtes, thci Jfore, merely to the union of the States
is all that gives the least countenance to this super-
ficial idea ot an " ^xpenment" which has done so
much lo "íisgmde the speculations of some vision-
aiy mmds upon these important matters Even in
tu-, respei t, 1 o we vei, an attentive study of our his-
t i\ vi'l show that strong federal tendencies existed
a i I hid, frequently, on former occasions, manifest-
ed theioselve? * But the whole constitution of
