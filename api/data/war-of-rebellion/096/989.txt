Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance, other than what has been already communicated to the commanding general, has transpired on the lines of this corps during the past twenty-four hours. A deserter states that the two men who rode through our lines into those of the enemy belonged to our army and that they did so through mistake.

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The usual state of affairs prevails along our lines. Six deserters came in during the night from Wise's, Gracie's, and Ransom's brigades. They agree that Wallace's brigade has been relieved by a brigade of Gordon's, and believe that all are to be relieved by Gordon. One of them states that a man from Richmond yesterday morning informed a member of his company that our people had burned Camp Lee.
