relieved by two from the vicinity of Savannah so as to allow them, after the serve duty they have recently done, to recruit the men and horses and to make such necessary repairs as will put them upon a first-rate war footing. They can be exchanged for two others, with guns of same caliber and kinds; except for eight Napoleons, six can be supplied of this kind and two 12-pounder howitzers by bringing on the Terrell Light Artillery, Captain John W. Brooks, and Captain Charles Daniell's [battery], both of which have been recently inspected and found ready in every respect to take the field with men not worn by fatigue, and well drilled, and horses and harness in excellent condition. These commands would also be benefitted by giving them experience in the field, of which my impression is they have as yet had but little.

Respectfully submitted by your obedient servant,

G. U. MAYO,

Major and Assistant Inspector of Artillery.
