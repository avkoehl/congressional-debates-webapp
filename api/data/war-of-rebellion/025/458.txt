BOLIVAR, TENN., December 22, 1862.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN:

La Grange and Grand Junction not taken. The enemy passed west of them and are within 12 miles of here, supposed to be 4,000 strong-cavalry. Send down the Forty-third and Sixty-first if you can spare them. I don't, at any rate, fear the result.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HENDERSON, December 22, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

I hear that General Hamilton has sent scouts to Bethel, and that no force lies between Bolivar and Bethel. I shall send Hurst's cavalry to Bolivar to-morrow.

I must get my command to Corinth and ration them ready for another move. If it becomes necessary I will demonstrate in that direction.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

December 22, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

What news from Jackson? Are the road and wires right north of you?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HUMBOLDT, TENN., December 22, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

I arrived here at dusk. Bridges all right this far; reported badly broken toward Trenton.

Strong rumor of an attack here to-night. I am making arrangements for them.

I. N. HAYNIE,

Brigadier-General.

HUMBOLDT, December 22, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

A citizen from near Trenton reports the Confederate cavalry left for Union City; their plunder left this morning only for Tennessee River.

GEORGE P. IHRIE,

Colonel, Commanding.

GRAND JUNCTION, December 22, 1862.

General GRANT:

I received dispatch to-day for all troops north of Holly Springs and south of Bolivar to fall back to Bolivar, signed by General Grant.

I could not fall back, as the enemy was in our rear. Was the order genuine? Everything quiet, but the enemy in large force near.

J. MCDERMOTT,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
