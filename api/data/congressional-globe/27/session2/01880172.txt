session, yet that body, coming fresh from the people, had not
thought proper to indicate that his course of action on this
question was not m strict accordance with the wishes of the
State He had looked for an expression of opinion from that
source, and heshould, withouthesitation, have conformed hi?

hut few of the people of the State had expressed to him an
opinion, and these opinions divided, he felt justified m maintain-
