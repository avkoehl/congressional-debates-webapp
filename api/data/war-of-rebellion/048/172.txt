cordially approved, and the energy and skill manifested by you and your assistance and subordinates receives the admiration and thanks so well merited.

Secretary of War.

BENWOOD, W. VA., September 28, 1863.

(Received 10.55 a.m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Am I to understand from your dispatch that I am relieved from command? By the displacing of trains and cars at several depots, the different command have become so mixed up that it would have been highly desirable, and rather expedite matters instead of causing delay, if they should be put in order. No train has been delayed so far,but the above difficulty is causing great inconvenience, which I desire to remedy. An answer to above question is respectfully solicited.

C. SCHURZ,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, September 28, 1863-1.35 p.m.

Major General CARL SCHURZ,

Benwood, via Wheeling:

General Hooker is authorized to relieve from command any officer that interferes with or hinders the transportation of troops in the present movement. Whether you have done,so and whether he has relieved from command, ought to be known to yourself. The order will certainly be enforced against any officer, whatever his rank may be, who delays or endangers transportation of troops.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

BEALETON, September 28, 1863.

(Received 1.30 p.m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON:

All troops gone. Will report to you to-night.

D. C. McCALLUM.

CAMDEN STATION, September 28, 1863-3 p.m.

(Received 3.30 p.m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON:

Off our road there is some remissness about the reports, but the first three trains have passed Columbus,and I think I can say all is going well there. I have urged the sending of prompt and regular bulletins, and hope to reply to you on the subject before long.

W. P. SMITH.
