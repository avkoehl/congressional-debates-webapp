probable rate of taxation; and it will cost the
Government less to pay bonds at a low rate of
interest than to collect taxes and pay officers
therefor on bonds bearing a high rate. By
funding at a low rate the tax is taken out in
advance without cost of collecting it.
BONDS YIELD TAXATION.
No matter what tlie rate of interest may be
Congress treats the bondholder and the land-
holder alike. Congress taxes neither lands
nor bonds, hut it taxes incomes from both
alike. Of the bonds $755,485,097 held by
national banks, savings-banks, and insurance
companies are taxed, not as bonds, but on in-
comes, and corporate capital stock invested in
them for all State and local purposes as other
property. The money or property received for
$800,000,000 held in Europe is taxed here for
all purposes. The residue is held largely by
trustees, guardians, widows, orphans, and as
investments for the earnings of the poor.
GOLD OE GREENBACKS—PAYMENT IMMATERIAL.
If this bill should pass and be carried into
execution the question 'whether the bonds are
payable in greenbacks or gold, all these exist-
ing questions, will be immaterial. Then no
question of broken national faith will impair
our honor or stare us in the face if in a future
emergency new loans shall be required. If paid
in greenbacks they in turn promise payment in
gold. To raise by taxation greenbacks to pay
the debt is impossible, and no man of any party
now advocates an issue for that purpose.
Neither the advocates of gold payment nor of
greenback payment will have any ground of
complaint, since a new contract will be made
scouring alike the interests and the honor of
the nation.
The uncertainty as to whatafuture Congress
may determine as to taxation and the mode of
payment, and the demand for a loan safe as a
permanentinvestment in Europe and America,
will aid in rendering it practicable to fund the
debt. The national debt of Great Britain in
1869 was £750,000,000, and3 per cent, consols
sold at 91 to 94 per cent., though the prospect-
ive resources of England are less than those of
our own Government. The Dominion of Can-
ada has a debt of $90,000,000, including a 4 per
cent, loan of $10,000,000 negotiated in Lou-
don in July, 1808, under a guarantee of the
imperial Government, for railroad purposes.
The Massachusetts State gold 5 per cent, loan
of 1867, payable in 1894, was sold in London
at 77 in gold, and has since risen to 90, which,
with exchange, is equivalent to par in gold.
Now with our national credit assured, our
Government should be able to make a loan very
nearly if not entirely on the terms indicated in
the bill.
Tlie President's message expresses the opin-
ion that all the bonds—
"Now duo may be replaced by bonds bearing a
rate of interest not exceeding 4?pcr cent."
Let us make the effort, and with the confi-
dence which President Grant's administration
has inspired success may be reasonably anti-
cipated; it may not be in a month or a year,
but very soon.
WIIY POSTPONE PAYMENT OP DEBT?
But why postpone the payment of the debt?
Bo we not perpetuate a burden, and continue
to pay large sums in interest? If all the people
were ready to jmy the amount necessary to
liquidate the entire debt it might be well.
The "funding bill" will accommodate alike
those who are ready to pay and those who are
not. The capitalist with money to spare can
buy the old or the new "bonds, and he will
have the means of paying his share of the debt,
the interest while it runs, and finally the prin-
cipal.
But to most men it will be of greater advan-
tage to let the Government continue to pay a
low rate of interest, by revenues derived from
whisky or imported foreign luxuries, than to
exact from tliein by taxation money they need
for the successful prosecution of business, and
which is worth to them more than the interest
the Government will pay.
It is better to let posterity pay the.debt when
their increased numbers and wealth will make
the burden light. From 1790 to 1860 our pop-
ulation has increased at the rate of 35 per cent,
in every decade, and in the year 1900 it will
reach 100,000,000. The debt is now more
than $60 per head of our population ; in 30
years, if we should not pay a dollar of the
principal, it would be less than $24. It would
oppress the people now to pay this debt either
in greenbacks or gold ; it will not oppress them
to let posterity pay it 30 or 40 years hence.
The tangible property comprising individual
and corporate wealth in the United States is
now about $30,000,000,000. To pay the debt
now would require, through taxation, a sur-
render of one twelfth of all this property. Is
every farmer ready to surrender every twelfth
acre of his farm, and every merchant, me-
chanic, and business man ready to make alike
sacrifice ?
Wealth is increasing 100 per cent, in every
period of 10 years, and in 30 years at that ratio
it will reach $240,000,000,000, and then a levy
of 1 per cent, tax on the taxable property
would pay the whole debt in a single year. Let
posterity, then, pay at leastthe largest share of
this debt created in suppressing this rebellion
for their benefit as well as ours. This genera-
tion has done its part, has endured the sacri-
fices of the war, has paid $1,500,000,000 of
war expenses, and now taxation should be
vastly reduced under national and State au-
thority to encourage productive industry, as it
may if this bill shall be passed.
BELIEF FltOM TAXATION.
From the 1st of March, 1869, to March, 1870,
the Government has paid $87,134,782 of the
national debt.
No other nation has ever given such a won-
derful financial example. The effect has been
to establish our public credit, and secure for
us alike the admiration and respect of all na-
tions.
But to accomplish this taxation has been and
yet is enormous.
For the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, if
the present revenue laws are continued in force,
the receipts into the Treasury are estimated by
the Secretary as follows:
Customs $185,000,000
Internal revenue  175,000,000
Lands    5,000,000
Miscellaneous sourees, including pre-
mium on gold  28,000,000
Total $393,000,000
During the last fiscal year the receipts were
$370,943,747; the expenditures, $321,490,597;
leaving a surplus of $49,453,149; and for the
first year of Grant's administration the sur-
plus was nearly $100,000,000.
The internal revenues were $100,039,344,
derived from tiiese sources for the last fiscal
year:
Spirits $45,026,401
Fermented liquors  6,099,879
Tobacco  23,430,707
Banks  3,335,510
Gross receipts:
lotteries  $60,329
Theaters  231,052
Billiard-rooms 131,418
Bowling-alleys  37,890
Circuses  18,2i3
Lottery-ticket dealers  58,210 '
  517,102
Amount carricd forward     $78,409,605
Amount brought forward $78,409,065
Incomes, $34,229,873; most of it as fol-
lows :
Incomes 5 per cent, over $1,000  25,025,065

Carriages over $500 in value  48,421
Gold and silver plate  204,732
Gold and silver watehes  993,788
$114,044,914
The residue of the internal revenue, $45,-
994,430, was derived from sources falling
mostly on productive industry, on labor. It was
paid mostly by consumers and comes in good
part from the wages of labor, and should be
reduced or abolished. It was as follows :
Stamps $10,420,710
Sales by manufacturers, eattle brokers,
butchers, dealers, &c  8,206,839
Special taxes (licenses) for cattle and
other broker?, builders, butclicrs, retail
dealers, hotels, peddlers, tradesmen,
and lawyers  8,801,454
Tax on gross receipts of bridge!-, canals,
express companies, ferries, insurance
companies, railroads, ships, stages,
steamboats, telegraph companies, &e... 6,300,998
Legacies    I,2t4,837
Successions  1,189,756
Gas  2,071,547
On other manufactures  1,229,357
Other sourees  528,932
Total  $45,991,430
The Secretary of the Treasury estimates on
the basis of existing laws the revenues for the
fiscal year ending June 30,1871, $393,000,000;
the expenditures, $291,000,000 ; leaving a sur-
plus of $102,000,000 applicable to the public
debt.
If it is to'the interest of the people to con-
tinue the existing taxes by tariff and internal
revenue laws then we can pay $100,000,000 of
the public debt during the current fiscal year.
But I insist that it is our true policy to re-
duce taxation, and if the expenditures even
could not be reduced below $280,000,000 we
ought not to raise more than $300,000,000 and
pay $10,000,000 a year of the other classes
of bonds not included in the five-twenties,
and when these shall be funded so as to save
$25,000,000 a year by reducing the rate of
interest, taxation can still further be reduced
and yet annually pay $20,000,000 o£ the debt,
and thus maintain the pledge of the nation,
embodied in the provision for a sinking fund.
If the tariff laws should be changed so as
to remove some duties and reduce others, still
$160,000,000 could probably be raised from
duties, though this might be somewhat re-
duced.
Then our policy is to abolish all internal
revenue taxes except those levied on vices or
luxuries, or incomes so accumulated as to bear
taxation almost unfelt. The Commissioner of
Internal Revenue estimates that we can raise
annually from spirits and liquors $68,000,000 ;
tobacco, $35,000,000; and it is clear that from
lotteries, theaters, billiards, shows, carriages,
watches, gold and silver plate, we can raise
$2,000,000 or more. Then let us abolish all
small stamps and raise from large ones $13,-
000,000, abolish the income tax on all net
incomes under $2,000, levy 3 per cent, on
incomes between $2,000 and $6,000, and 5
per cent, on all over, including incomes from
banks, bonds, salaries, &e., and from those
sources raise $25,000,000, and the residue from
other sources—corporations, legacies, sucees-
