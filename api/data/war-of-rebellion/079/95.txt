Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Marietta, October 5, 1864.

General O. O. HOWARD,

I want you to select a line to connect on your right with General Stanley, and the left to cover Powder Springs road. I don't care about you being out as far as Kolb's. It may be the old rebel line this side is equally good, but you can select. I want to advance the right of our general line, General Cox, to the Santown road, and will put his left on General Stanley's right, Pine Top Mountain, and his right forward as far as possible.

Yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMNA,

Major-General, Commanding.

Statement of Private George A. Curle, Company A, Tenth MISSISSIPPI Infantry, forwarded at 5 p. m. by General Kilpatrick:

Regiment is in Sharp's brigade, Johnson's DIVISION, Hardee's corps. Deserted four days ago near Dallas. Hood's army (Hardee's, Lee's, and Stewart's corps) crossed the Chattahoochee five days ago, with ten days' rations-four in haversacks, six in wagons. Two DIVISIONS of cavalry were left near Palmetto; no other troops south of the river Heard officers say that the army would go to Rome, and connect with Forrest, who would keep the railroads destroyed. After crossing the river Hardee's and Lee's corps marched to within eight miles of Dallas, and returned to Powder Springs. Has been in the woods since he deserted until to-night; ran into pickets of Hardee's corps last night on Sandtown road, two miles east of Powder Springs; talked with pickets some time, and learned that Hardee's and Lee's corps were camped there.
