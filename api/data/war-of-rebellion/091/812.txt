HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, December 20, 1864.

General STEVENSON:

Captain Flagg telegraphs that there are some troops at Harpers' Ferry, and he does not know which direction they are to go. What troops are they? I know nothing about them. Some sick, convalescents, &amp;c., about 140 in all, were sent from here about 4 a. m. to-day. The men Captain Flagg refers to may be some stragglers belonging to the division that went off yesterday. They must not leave Harper's Ferry until we know here what they belong to.

JAS. W. FORSYTH,Chief of Staff.

HARPERS' FERRY, December 20, 1864.

Colonel FORSYTH,

Chief of Staff:

No troops having reported here, I knew nothing of any being here until your dispatch was received. On investigation I find 280 Second West Virginia Veteran Volunteers, under Captain Boswell, arrived this evening about 7 p. m., under orders from Brevet Brigadier-General Harris to go to Cumberland to report to Lieutenant Colonel Gabriel Middleton. Under this order Captain Flagg gave them transportation to Cumberland. They have been gone two hours.

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, December 20, 1864-10.30 p. m.

General CROOK:

Telegram of General Kelley in reference to Rosser's movements received. The general directs that you send a regiment from General Duval's division, as you suggest, to Beverly. The general does not think from the information that he has from General Custer that this report can be correct.

J. W. FORSYTH,Chief of Staff.
