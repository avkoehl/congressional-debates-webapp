steamship service to australia.
Mr. CORBETT. My attention has been
called to a statement in one of the morning
papers in relation to the bill (S. No. 736) re-
ported yesterday from the Committee on Com-
merce, to authorize i*ic establishment of ocean
mail steamship service between the United
States and Australia. It is stated in that paper
that the subsidy proposed is increased by the
committee from $300,000 to $600,000; whereas
the truth is that the original bill provided for
a subsidy of $500,000, and the committee
reported in favor of allowing a subsidy of
$300,000, on the condition that the Australian
colonies allow an equal subsidy. I merely
wish to correct this statement to prevent other
papers from falling into the same error.
