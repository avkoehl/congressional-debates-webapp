Freedom of Elections—Mr. Bell.
H. of Reps
Character and influence, who has it in his power to render any
important service to the Administration, by becoming a candi-
date in any election, shall make any sacrifice of time or business
for which he will not be amply i ewarded. 1 now, in my place
•n this floor, make the same statement This policy is now well
known and understood It may be regarded as a general maxim
of the President, "whom the people reject, I will elect " If a
gentleman is indue d to sacrifice his professional or other pros-
pect* to become the candidate of the Administration in any im-
portant election, and la defeated, he is sure to be amply compen
gated by an oflice-or emp oyment of equal, and probably oi far
greater value by the President, than the one he failed to get from
the people'
What is this practice, sir, when systematically pursued, but
•owing corrupuon broadcast through the lamP How many can-
didates for the office of Governor in the States, for seats m Con-
gress in particular and contested districts, have, upon their de
feat, been rewarded by moi e profitable, and, in many instances,
by higher stations') How many worn out hack* of the party—
gentlemen who entered public life with some character, but lost
it in a long service marked by a servile submission to the will
and behests of power—have been rescued from the resentment
of the people—that just penalty of violated trusts—by the sus-
tainine hand of the President! Is this practice m accordance
with Democratic or Republican principles! Is this an orthodox
method of giving effect to the will of the people, or of sustaining
their sovereignty! If it be so, sir, it is, I affirm, wholly of modern
invention.
But tins abuse is not limited to the giving of offices and em-
ployments to defeated candidates only Many instances have
occurred in which the interests of party have been consulted at
the expense of public principle and the public service, by con-
ferring lucrative employments upon rival candidates tor the
same station, that there might be no division in the Administra-
tion ranks < A most shameful and flagrant example of this
abuse occurred a few years ago, in the case of the two gentlemen
who were about to enter the lists for the Executive chair in the
State of Pennsylvania; and there have been many such cases of
less notoriety, but all involving the same gross violation of prin-
ciple.
I wish it were in our power to prevent, by legal enactments,
another abuse of a kindred nature, and which is becoming but
too common It is the practice of training up and pampering
Administration candidates—embryo members of Congress and
others—a year or two before they are brought out upon the
course. By this process, they are prepared to make the ne-
cessary sacrifices to secure succes3 in their districts or States,
and they make their appearance in the two Houses of Congress,
or m some other station of importance to their party, already
swollen, but not satiated, with spoil; with their appetites
whetted, and, like those animals which having once tas'ed of
human b ood become doubly ferocious, they are more forward,
u;.scrupulous and untiring, than all others in their support of
power But I can think ol no provision of law by which this
evil can be rtached. A sound state of public sentiment and
morals only can remedy this mischief
When pressing the importance of pa«swg some law to punish
bribery and corruption in the higher offices of the Government,
I have been often met by the argument that, in despite of the
most rigorous laws, a great deal of that sort of undue and im-
proper influence which is denominated corruption will prevail
in the administration of any Government; that it will always
assume such forms and disguises as to elude detection and
punishment. AH this I agree to; but that does not show that
penal laws may not greariy diminish the amount of the evil.
•Sir, if such laws can answer no other purpose than to prevent
the principle of corruption from becoming incorporated into
oursystem; from becoming the characteristic feature in its ope-
ration; from walking abroad openly and shamelessly, they will
do much; for, when that time «halt come, who will feel himself
called upon to defend such a polluted country either with his
purse or his sword! A question would then arise whether a
monarchy, with the nece sary appendage of a corrupt court,
but leaving the mass of society pure and uncontaminated,
would not be preferable to a system which can only be sup-
ported by corrupting the body of society—the people them-
selves1
We have laws in all the States for the punishment of bribery
and corruption in ihe candidates and electors. This, it seems,
is a species of petty bribery which it is well enough to restrain
and punish. Mo one objects to this; but why not punish the
fcr more injurious and wholesale bribery and corruption in
the official magnates of the land! Does genuine Democracy
object!
Again, sir, I have had to meet this objection You propose to
correct, as far as possible, by law, the increasing corruption and
profligacy manifest mthe operation of our political rystem; why
not extend the proposed corrective to the undue and corrupt in-
fluence exercised by the banks! I am asked whether public men,
members of Congress and others, may not be unduly influenced
or corrupted by the banks, as well as by th6 offices and employ-
ments in the gift of the President! I answer, yes; and I could
point out many other sources of a corrupt influence upon public
men, includirg members of Congress, besides the banks. In
truth, in every branch of the public service, in every branch of
private business, there are interests and feelings to be promoted
•and grat fled, which are more or less corrupting in their mfl uence
on the public men connected with them. But it must be borne in
mind that these sources of undue influence are limited toa single
object in each case, as in the instance of the banks. They have
a deep interest in sustaining their charters, and in resisting a
course of policy which would render them useless and unpro-
fitable. But, as to the policy of the country eenerally, or as to
who shall be in or who shall be out ol office, the bank interest
is wholly indifferent. So of any other source of corruption not
connected with the public service As to the banks, ordinarily,
there are no inducements to improper influences on their part.
It is only when their charters, their existence, may beinjao
pardy; and then, the moment the questions in which they are
concerned are settled, we hear no more of them The evil in
regard to them is necessarily transient, as well as limited in ex-
tent The scope and object of the bill un'er consideration, I
hope, will he regarded as sufficiently comprehensive, hunted as
they are te the prevention of undue influence and corruption in
the administration of Executive patronage. It does not profess
to provide for the punishment of bribery and corruption in eve-
ry form In which it may exist. But, if I were pressed upon the
subject of providing a remedy for tne undue influence of the
banks, er of "associated-wealth," I would sav that it will be per.
hapa fortunate for the countryif the banks, or some other more
powerful source of influence connected with the public liberty
and prospenty, should always exist, to hold in check and coun-
teract the constant tendency of the Federal Executive to bring
within us control the whole country—every institution, public
and private, all its interests, and every other branch of the Go-
vernment.   Banks are only to be feared wnen they are found in
alliance with the Executive; for they are themselves liable to be
corrupted and controlled by Executive influence and patronage
And gentlemen will find that the provisions of ary bill which
proposes to restrain the corrupting influence of the banks upon
public men, must extend far beyond the precincts of the legisla-
tive department    I saw, in a recent number of the oflicialor'
gan, (the Globe,) a labored attack upon the Opposition, alleging
a design to bring the House into contempt and disrepute with
the people, in order to overthrow our free form of government
But how long has it been since that organ, and all its associate
Editors, ofhc al and others, were laboring, day and night, to con
vince the country that a majority of both Houses of Congiess
were utteily corrupt, and unworthy of trust and confidence;
charging directly that they were the mercenary advocates and
hired instruments of the United States Bank '  At a later period,
our Conservative friends came in for their share of these denun-   ¡
ciations,and the whole Opposition in Congress were then stigma
tl8ed as the servile and corrupt supporters of the State banks   I
Who, or what party, was it, which then sought to ovei throw  i
the Constitution, by destroying the   credit of the legislative
branch of the Government!   'Ihe doctune of those in power
is, that none but the President and his devoted  paitisans are
guiltless of this sin of bank influence and bank corruption'
They only are immaculate'   Yet, you may remembpr, sir, that,
when it was proposed to look into the affairs of the deposite
banks, to ascertain to whaf extent the means of speculating in
the puolic lands by some of the high officeis of the Govern-
ment, and numerous favorites and partisans of the Administra
tion besides, had been provided by those banks, it was objected
that they were State institutions, and it would be a violation of
State rights if Congress should assume the pow~r to inquire in'o
the management ot their affairs'   The point I wish to enforce
by these remarks is this: that the banks and every other source
of undue influence and corruption which does or can exist in
this country, except the one struck at by this bill, are more
strongly tempted and attracted—fnore liable, on every account,
to lavish their means of corruption upon the Executive depart-
ment of the Government than upon any other branch    Where
there Is most i ower and influence in moulding the policy and
measures of the Government, there will fasten the mass of cor
rupt appliances of every kind; and that the Executive is, and
has been for years, the superior and controlling branch of the
Government, all the world knows.   Executive officers may be-
come, may have been, the corrupt tools and instruments of bank
mtetest and bank influences, as well as members of Congress;
and it may one day be disclosed that some of the di posite banks,
acting upon the Executive department, wielded a more exten-
sive and potent influence over the domestic policy of the coun-
try than, the United States Bank ever attemp'ed or aspired to
Thetemplation wasgreat—theprize was dazzling, and the mode
of operation equally daring and questionable    I will not insi-
nuate that the late President was swaj ed, in the part he took in
the transactions to which I allude, by corruption in Ins own per-
son.   This I do not believe; and, il I did, for the honor of the
country, for the sake of our institutions, and of the high office
which he held, I would not state it; but, what I mean to affirm
is, that the country was in more danger from the corrupting in-
fluences of the banks, acting upon the official advisers of the
President and other subordinate agen san i instruments employ-
ed in conducting the war against the United Stales Bank, than it
ever has, orean be, from the operation of similar influences upon
the Legislatures—the more numeious branch of the Govern-
ment
I have, Mr Speaker, finished the review of the several ptovi-
sionsof the bill which I designed I have extended my remarks
beyond the limits I had prescribed >o myself, but I could not
have curtailed them and have done justice to the subject. The
mtiinsic importance of thequestion, the deep interest 1 have so
long taken in it; and, above all, the uncommon degree of unfair
ness and ferocity with which this measure has been attacked,
have prompted me to a full discussion of it.
And now, sir. I must be allowed to express my deep regret, I
may say the deep mortification, I feel, that this subject should
receive so small a share of the public attention, that it should
excite so little interest in this House I am mortified, not only
on my own, but the public account. Above all, I regret that I
cannot have the co-operation of the whole Whig interest in this
House and out of it, on sucli a question That I should meet
With some opposition in the Whig ranks, I was prepared to ex
pect; some, I supposed, might oppose this measure because they
had become prejudiced and alarmed by what they hid heard
of the nature of th  la^e bill of the Senate; others, be-
cause this was a new measure, and they could not, or would not
spare the time to examine it, and some, because they do not re
gard the spoils doctrine of Governor Marcy asanyheresj' But
I trust there are but few Whigs in this House who hold such de-
testable opinions
I would not be set down, Mr Speaker, as a believer in the ex-
istence of absolute purity and perfection, in the management of
human affaits, at anytime This, certainly, is not an age of mi-
racles in this respect. We can only expect to witness the prac-
tice of the austere virtues in an eminent degree in primitive
communities, in which there is but little to tempt the ambi'ion
or cupidity of patriotic and virtuous minds But I would re
mind those who think that the "spoils" are a necessary stimu
lant to patriotism in resisting bad men and a ruinous Adminis-
tration, that the principles of my bill will make it the so'emn and
bounden duty of any President who may hereafter come into
power, to dismiss from office not only the unfaithful and incom-
petent, but all such as have gone out of their way to interfere in
elections, State or national. And if there is any portion of the
Whigs to whom this does not furnish sufficient ground of hope
and expectation—to whom this latitude of removal does not hold
out sufficient inducement to exertion—they are unreasonable
and insatiate; they are hot rightly sorted; they belong intrinsi-
cally to the spoils party.
I must repeat the expression of my surprise that tins subiect
has «cited so little attention here and felsewhere To me it is
strange and incomprehensible that the measure I have proposed
or some other of a similar and even more radical nature, has not
forced itself upon the attention of the reflecting men of the coun-
try, considering the alarming character ana tendency ol the
times. What, in fact, lias been the cause of the fierce and destruct-
ive party warfare in which wo have been so long enaased, but
a question of Executive patronage! It lies at tha foundation of
the disastrous condition of all our great interests at this moment
It has been a great and convulsive stiuggle on the part of the
Executive to subdue every element of opposition to us will. Ño
alternative was left but submission or destruction Though for
a long 'ime unknown and unsuspected by many of the most
ardent and patriotic of those who rejoiced in the election of Ge-
neral Jackson, yet subsequent events confirmed the suspicion 
of some at the time, that there was a settled plan—a scheme,
concerted between a lew of Ihe most influential of his friends
and supporters—to establish a system of Executive control, to
deeply and jet so artlully combined with etery great source of
patronage and influence in any way connected with the Govern-
ment as to set all opposition at defiance for the future, and (o
secure to them and their appointees undisturbed possession of
power.
The first step in the execution of this plan was to make the
Postmaster General a member of the Cabinet; and what was
then given out as a necessary arrangement in the execution of
the extensive reforms meditated b> the new Administration
was, in fact, designed to carry out the doctrines of the Albany
school of politics, as indicated in the proceedings of 1822, al-
leady referred to, and to reduce the Post Ofice Department to
the condition of a subservient political engine—an instrument
of Executive power and influenc1 Was thnwalking in the
footsteps of Jefferson i The very first pi inciple of administra-
tion adop ed by that great Republics  leadei, after his indue
tion into office, was, that the Po=t Office Department should be
p eservedfiee and unbiassed in its operations by the partisan
heat and violence of the times, ncu, above all, would he al'ew
any connection between ihe public press and the public post.
In a letter to Mr Macon, of North Carolina, written on the
11th of May, 1801, he informs him that "a very early recom-
mendation had been given to the Postmaster General to employ
no printer, foreigner, or revolutiomry tory, in any of his ot-
fices " What he meant by excluding printers was illustrated
by his positive refusal t* appoint a successful and distinguished
paitisan tditoi to an office in that Department. It has been
the settled policy of the present Administration, on the contrary,
wherever the circumstances were favorable, to establish such a
direct connection and dependence between the public press and
the public post as to insure a faithful co-operation in its sup-
port In numerous instances, apf ointments have been made
in this Department not only of printers, but of men that they
may become punters At last, we find, not only a printer—a
hack writer ot the party—but the most intolerant, violent, and
proscriptive of the who'e corps, placed at the head of the Ge-
neral Post Office '   Still, these are the followers of Jefferson'
The next great public institution and source of influence to
be approached and subdued was the United Ssta es Bank. It
was first sounded, and, not being found pliant enough, it was
menaced, and, when that would not do, forth went the fiat for
l's destruction. Whatever may have been tho opinions formed
by the uninitiated membeis of the party as i  the particular
motive of the movement against ihe United States Bank, and
without questioning at all that there were early and deep pre-
judices in a certain great quarter against that institution, yet
the subsequent history o the Bank warfare shows, conclusive-
ly, that the instigators and principal abettors of that war, from
the beginning, were resolved to subdue its independence, or to
prostiato it altogether They were resolved not to suffer the
existence of so powerful an institution, unless it could be
brought to co operate with the dominant party in the political
conflicts of the day—the only contineency in which such an
institution is tobe feared' Experience has now fully demon-
strated that a United States Bank, with the strongest hold upon
popular lavor, added to all the extraneous, and, if you please,
the corrupt influences it can bring to bear, is no match for the
power of the Executive' The late Bank of the United States
had the decided support, not only of the legislative department
of the Governmen'. butthe cordial favor and confidence of the
people themselves, in the commencement of the comes', yet it
finally fell under the increising and irresistible energy of the
Executive aim ' lust as every other institution and depart
ment of the Government itself is destined to fall, if this gigantic
power is not speedily reduced
When it was discovered that the bank would not yield—when
its directors firmly, but respectfully, declined any co-operaiioh *
with the Executive in the execution of Us political schemes,
the arch conspirators sought to acquire an equal amount of pa
tronage by establishing a connection between the Executive
and the most powerful of the Statp banks This thev readily
accomplished. But when the deposite banks broke down under
the accumulated burdens of excessive issues and extended cre-
dits, (a consequence of their obedience to Treasury orders)—
under the eftecis of the specie circular, co-operating with in-
creased commercial embarrassments, and it v/as foreseen that
they could be of no further service in upholding the fortunes of
the Administration—the money power was grasped at, through
a new institution, (the Sub Treasury,) and we now find our
selves still hotly engaged in a struggle lor the independence of
this power on the one hand, and its subserviency to th  will
and purposes of the Executive on the other—at the end of ten
yeaisfrom the day when the fiist overture was made for the
control of the United Slates Bank ' The monger power will
never be appeased untilit shall havedrawn within its voracious
jaws every element of strength and influence withia the reach
of its gigantic irms '
I have a word or two to say to the real Republicans—to the
State Rights men, who may be inclined to support the Adminis-
tration, because they aie pot satisfied te go with the Opposi
tion; andlask them Whatisityeu would preserve! What is
it you most fear! When I observe the quiet complacency wiih
which this one powerf .il and famous party look on the practices
of those in power, and the general evils of ihetimes, I must
co ífess my astonishment. I often ask myself, when 1 reflect
upon this subject, what ha3 become of that tribe of pungent,
fierce, and powerful wi iters, who once filled the columns of a
celebrated lournal of the "outh! WhTe have vanished those
successful alarmists of the Virginia school, who kindled the fire
of patriotism End determined opposition to Federal usurpation
in the breastofeveryyouthful leader' Are they dead, ordo
they only sleep! Have they abandoned their ancient creed, or
did they only conjure up the spectre of consolidation trampling
upen the nghlsof the States to frighten the ignorantarid credu-
lous! If, on the contrary, they weresincerein their professions,
why is it that we do not hear their voice, as in times past, raised
far above the ordinary dm of the conflict! Do they not see that
the power and influence of the States, in their organic form, aie
no longer felt or respected; that Federal influences and Federal
interest ride over all'                                             ^^
What are the reserved right  of the States worth! What wil
be their value as earners against the eucroaenment of the Fe
