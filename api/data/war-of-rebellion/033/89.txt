little more than to hold the matter before the people, as I am urged to do by your most discreet and loyal friends. I claim that the success of my commands, the popular demonstrations at the ballot-box, the peace of Missouri, the public demonstration, all demonstrate the propriety of such a policy. I earnestly try to prevent the gathering into my lines of any, especially the negroes of loyal citizens, and especially because they encumber my camps. There is no occasion for orders to exclude, because the encumbrance prevents any considerable amount of such fugitives, except in Arkansas, where thousands do come within our lines, and I have tried to protect and use them for various purposes. I have no trouble with the soldiers, the people, or the negroes, but a few officers, a few slaveholders, and a few butternut politicians are constantly trying to make a mountain out of a mole-hill, and procuring a false impression somewhere.

Missouri can only be successful in her efforts to settle down quietly in the Union by allowing the Union leaders, and not the Union doubters,to hold the sway and direct public opinion. The slave power will be respected, but it cannot lead in this department. The people have resolved to carry out your war policy, and I rejoice in their determination.

I am, Mr. President, your obedient servant,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
