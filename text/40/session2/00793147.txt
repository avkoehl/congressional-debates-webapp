1868.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
improperly; whether the committee inquired
as to that?
Mr. MORGAN. It would appear that the
Treasury circular issued in 1861 was carried
into effect in all the other ports of the country.
Mr. Barney was the only collector who ob-
j ected.
Mr. CONNESS. That appears by the in-
vestigation ?
Mr. MORGAN. Yes, sir; that appears by
the investigation.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, was read the third time, and
CONTRACTORS TOR IRON-CLADS.
Mr. DRAKE. I move that the Senate take
up the joint resolution (S. R. No. 100) for the
relief of certain contractors for the construc-
tion of vessels of war and steam machinery.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore put the ques-
tion on the motion ; but before announcing the
result
Mr. STEWART. That resolution will cer-
tainly lead to discussion, and I desire to call up
to-day, and I should like to do it in the morning
hour, a bill to remove political disabilities.
Mr. DRAKE. I hope the Senator will allow
me to call this resolution to come up now.
Mr. STEWART. Let me make a single
remark. It is necessary that the bill to which
I refer should be considered to-day, in order
that the State governments may go into opera-
tion. It will relieve a large number of persons
who have been ele.cted to office, and it is very
important that the bill should be passed to-day.
Mr. DRAKE. Mr. President, did the Sen-
ate agree to take up the joint resolution I men-
tioned or not?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore,. That is the
question pending now.
Mr. DRAKE. I appeal to the Senator from
Nevada in this matter. I do not see that there
is any necessity for discussion over this resolu-
tion. The whole matter has been extensively
discussed in connection with the bill that was
passed the other day. I think the Senate can
come to a vote upon it immediately without
debate : and as I jiave never asked the Senate
before, I believe, to take up any matter in the
morning hour I should be very glad to be
gratified in this instance.
Mr. STEWART. The taking up of the bill
I have mentioned is no particular gratification
to me. It is a matter of public business which
must be done ; but I withdraw my opposition
and am willing that the resolution of the Senator
should come up.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques
tion is on taking up the joint resolution for
consideration.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the joint resolution (S. R. No. 100) for
the relief of certain contractors for the con-
struction of vesselsof war and steam machinery.
The preamble recites that Congress, by an
act passed on the lid of March, 1887, provided
for the investigation by the Secretary of the
Navy of the claims of all the contractors for
building vessels of war and steam machinery,
and that pursuant to that act the Secretary of
the Navy appointed a naval board for the invest-
igation of the claims in question, and that it
appears that the provisions of said act have not
been fully conformed to in the findings of the
board ; and Congress having neither the time
nor means for the careful legal investigation
which the importance of the subject demands,
to relieve it from the further consideration of
the subject, and as a final settlement of the
claims of the contractors, the resolution pro1
vides the claims for building vessels of war
and steam machinery, reterred to in the act
entitled 'โข An act for the relief of certain con-
tractors," &e., approved March 2, 1867, be
referred to the Court of Claims, which is hereby
vested with jurisdiction under that act, whose
duty it shall be to investigate and determine j
the claims of the several petitioners upon the j
principles of that act, and its finding is to have I
the same force and effect as any other judg-
ment of the Court of Claims.
Mr. DRAKE. I have simply to say, sir,
unless some Senator calls for information with
regard to this resolution, that the whole thing
was incidentally discussed the other day in con-
nection with the bill which was urged by the
Senator from Indiana [Mr. Hendricks] to
pay certain sums of money to certain contract-
ors. If there is any point on which any Sen-
ator desires information to show the justice of
allowing the men concerned in the construc-
tion of these vessels to go into the Court of
Claims and establish their claim under the
terms of the act of March 2,18(57, I am ready
to give that information.
Mr, WILLIAMS. I should like to ask the
Senator if he does not propose by this resolu-
tion to refer to the Court of Claims such claims
as were submitted to and rejected by this board
of commissioners. Is not that the fact?
Mr. DRAKE. Mr. President, the act of
March 2, 1867, entitled "An act for the relief
of certain contractors for the construction of
vessels of warand sieam machinery," author-
ized the Secretary of the Navy "to investigate
the claims of all contractors for building ves-
sels of war and steam machinery for the same
under contracts made after the 1st day of May,
1861, and prior to the 1st day of January,
1861," which investigation was to be made upon
a basis specified in that act.
Mr. WILSON. What was the basis?
Mr. DRAKE. It was as follows :
"Hs shall ascertain the additional cost which was
necessarily incurred fay each contractor in the com-
pletion of hiswork by reason of any changes or alter-
ations in the plans and specifications required, and
delays in the prosecution ot the work occasioned by
the Government, which were not provided for m the
original contract; but no allowance for any advance
in the price of labor or material shall be consid-
ered unless such advance occurred during the pro-
longed timefor completing the work rendered aeces-
saiy by the delay resulting irom tho action ot the
Government aioresaid, and then only when such
advance could not have boen avoided by the exer-
cise of ordinary prudence and diligence on the part
of the contractor, and Irom such additional cost, to
be ascertained as aluresaid, there shall be deducted
such sum as may have been paid each contractor lor
any reason heretolore over and above the contract
price, and shall report to Congress a tabular state-
ment of each ease, which shall contain the name of
the contractor, adescriplionof the work, theoontract
price, the whole increased cost of the woilt over the
contract price, and the amount of such increased'
cost caused by the delay and action of the Govern-
ment as aforesaid, and the amount already paid the
contractor over and above the contract price."
Now, Mr. President, I will state in a few
words exactly how this matter stands. There
are quite a number of vessels concerning which
the claims of the contractors were submitted;
but 1 take the cases of nine of them, all of
one class, all built under precisely the same
contract, all to he built for the same sum of
money, atid all of them costing very largely
above what the contract price was. For in-
stance, here are three together built by the
firm of Secor & Co. and the firm of Perrine,
Secor & Co., to wit: the Manhattan, the Te-
cumseh, and the Mahopac. They cost over
and above the contract price $1,236,101 22.
Tho Navy Department paid over and above
the contract price $521,105 58, leaving a bal-
ance of excess over the contract price and that
amount of ip714,,.)05 61. This board that was
organized by the Secretary of the Navy under
the act of March 2, 1867, allowed to those indi-
viduals $115,539 01, leaving unprovided for
$599,366 63. That is one case.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I do not know that I fully
understand the Senator. Was this !pll5,000
allowed by the board in addition' to the ยง500,000
paid?
Mr. DRAKE. Yes, sir; that was in addi-
tion; and yet notwithstanding all that the Navy
Department paid them was above the contract j
price, and notwith standing the ยง>115,000 allowed
by the board, these individuals have nearly
$600,OUO of excess of cost over the contract
price for which there is no provision.
Now, pass on to the Oueotaandthc Catawba,
built by another concern. Upon these two
vessels the whole increased cost was upward
of six hundred and sixty-five thousand dollars.
The' Navy Department paid them upward of
three hundred and twenty-two thousand dol-
lars, and this board, though they stand upon
the very same footing as the others, the very
terms of the contract being identical, the alter-
ations identical, the delays identical, allow
them not one cent though they are five hundred
and thirty-three thousand dollars nearly out of
pocket. So in the case of the Manayunk, where
the whole increased cost was nearly three hun-
dred and iorty thousand dollars, one hundred
and sixty-six thousand and some odd hundred
dollars were allowed them by the Department,
nothing allowed them by this board at all, and
they are one hundred and sevdnt.y-two thou-
sand dollars and upward out of poeket. So in
the case of the Tippecanoe, Miles Greenwood,
on the same facts, is one hundred and seventy-
six thousand dollars and upward out of pocket.
So in the case of the Etlah, the builders are
upward of one hundred and fifty-six thousand
dollars out of pocket.
The fact is that this board allowed an ac-
count of five of these vessels built in the eastern
States the amounts specified in the bill that
was passed here the other day, and on the
other four of the nine built in the western
States they- allowed not one single cent; and
yet the circumstances under which they were
built were precisely the same, the contract the
same, the specifications the same, the delays
On the part of the Government the same, the
difference'in the price of gold duringthe period
of building the same! Still this board allowed
nothing.
Now, then, the simple request here is " Let
us go into the Court of Claims: we had no
clear showing before that commission ; we
sent in our request; they never gave us an
opportunity to go before them ; or at least they
never asked of us any explanation; they never
gave us an opportunity to come in there and
show them how it was that we were damaged.
Let us go before the Court of Claims, not for
a general demand upon the Government, but
let us go there upon the very specific terms of
the act of March, 1867, and if wo cannot there
show a case whereby we are entitled to relief
more than this board granted us then let us
be turned out. We know that we are to go
there and to stay there years before we get
this money or any part of it, before we can get
any allowance." We know, as I do know and
state to the Senate, the fact that some of those
concerns were bankrupted by these contracts;
and all that they ask is for the poor privilege
of going into the Court of Claims and showing
their whole case there ; and if, under the terms
of the act of March 2, 1867, they are entitled
to anything, let the court award it, and if they
are not, let the court say they are not, and there
is the end of it. That is all that is asked. I,
sir, appeal to the Senate on behalf of worthy
men who have actually been ruined, some of
them, by this whole transaction; and if it is
not a case where they can be allowed to go
there and show themselves entitled under this
act of March 2, 1867, not otherwise, to some
additional compensation, then of course the
Government will suffer naught by it.
Mr. CHANDLER. Mr. President, I do not
know the facts m regard to the contractors lor
these vessels, but 1 believe the vessels were
iron-clads ot a light draft, which were ordered
during the war. I remember that the Com-
mittee on the Conduct of the War was directed
by the Senate to investigate into the condition
of those iron-clads, and the Presiding Officer
and myself were on a sub-committee that did
investigate their condition. We went to Bos-
ton and Brooklyn and examined them, and we
found that of the twenty there was not one that
would float, but they would all go to the bot-
tom as quick as iron not worked into vessels.
Mr. DRAKE. Will the gentleman be so
good as to state if that was the case with any
of the eight named on the margi not this paper ?
Mr. CHANDLER. I do not remember.
Mr. DRAKE. Very well; I hope the gen-
tleman will be specific.
Mr. GHANDLfiti. In that case the Navy
