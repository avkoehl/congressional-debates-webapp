No cartel shall be permitted to remain in port more than ten days after her arrival, unless delayed by winds or weather or the order of the commanding officer of the station at which she may e, whether British or American; and in future cartels shall on no account, unless driven by stress of weather or some other unaviodable necessity, put into any British or American port save the ports hereinbefore appointed for the exchange of prisoners, unless specially agreed upon by the principal agents of the two Governments.
