GENERAL ORDERS. HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 63. December 6, 1864.

The following is the order of march for to-morrow: First, Gregg's cavalry; second, General Crawford's division; third, General Griffin's division; fourth, General Ayres' division; fifth, General Mott's division; sixth, the wagon train.

A battery will accompany each division. The whole will move at 6 a.m., the cavalry as much sooner as practicable. The route will be just south of the Yellow Tavern, of the Gurley house, of the Smith house, and of the Temple house, and then turning south along the Jerusalem plank road to the crossing of the Nottoway River at Freeman's Bridge. General Gregg will use a brigade of cavalry, or a sufficient force forward to protect the right flank and cover the rear of the wagon train, watching and holding all the roads toward Ream's Station and the roads coming from the Rowanty Creek until the train is past. General Ayres will furnish a brigade of infantry to accompany the wagon trains as guard. The train will be under Colonel Thomas, at the Gurley house. The ambulances of each division will accompany the division.

By command of Major-General Warren:

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
