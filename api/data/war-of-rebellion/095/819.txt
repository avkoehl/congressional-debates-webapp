My desire to retain the position we had gained after so much hard fighting, and which I considered under the circumstances so advantageous to us, was not accomplished, and orders came to fall back.

At 9.17 p. m. I received the following by telegraph dispatch, written by General Webb at 9 p. m.:

You will by the direction of the major-general commanding, draw back at once to your position within the Boydton plank road. Send a division down to Dinwiddie
