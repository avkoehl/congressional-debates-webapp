HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS, October 1, 1864.

Captain MARVIN,Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: It is probable that we shall make a demonstration in our front to-morrow at daylight. I wish the signal officer to be at his post as soon as it is light, and communicate with me any movement in my front after the attack on the left commences. If the enemy leave their works let me know it at once. He can send to you. Please see that the signal officer is informed to-night.

Very respectfully

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-5.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

Your dispatches of 11.50 September 30* and 12.15 October 1 just received. I very much fear that my loss is much heavier than I supposed it to be at the time you left yesterday, still I hope when the stragglers are all brought in that I may find I am mistaken. Before we withdrew to our present line, scouting parties reported the enemy still in position along the edge of wood just north of J. Pegram's. Before sending out a reconnaissance from my corps, I would much prefer making ourselves secure in our present position, which I cannot fully ascertain and realize until after daylight, still I will do the best I can to acquire the desired information.

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, October 1, 1864-9 a. m.

The enemy have advanced on General Warren and he is momentarily expecting an attack on Ayres. The enemy opened with artillery both on Ayres and on our force in the vicinity of Pegram's house. This force has been withdrawn and we now hold the intrenchments strong. No advance has yet been made. General Gregg is now here and will send a dispatch.

Respectfully,

JNumbers G. PARKE,
