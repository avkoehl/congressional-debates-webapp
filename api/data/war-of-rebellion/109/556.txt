HDQRS. DEPT. AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE, Euharlee Creek, Three Miles and a half from Van Wert, May 23, 1864 - 6.30 p. M.

Major-General SHERMAN,Commanding, &amp;c.:

The whole of the Fifteenth Army Corps is up except train, and two divisions in camp on the Van Wert side of the creek. General Dodge will go into camp near fine, large spring about a mile north of the creek. Garrad's cavalry are going into camp on the right and front of the advance divisions of infantry. By following the best and most direct road from where we crossed the Etowah River, it has carried us about three miles to the west of where I expected to cross the Euharlee, and made the march three miles farther to reach water. The distance to march to-morrow will, however, be less. We have met no enemy. A few rebel scouts were on the road ahead of us, but disappeared before we came up. I will endeavor to camp to-morrow night at the point A.

Yours, truly,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH OHIO VOLUNTEER CAVALRY, THIRD DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Huntsville, Ala., May 26, 1864.

Lieutenant C. L. WHITE,Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Third Div., Fifteenth Army Corps:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report that Major Rader has returned with the force sent to Paint Rock and Larkinsville. Colonel Raum, at Larkinsville, has just scouted the country to Bellefonte and found nothing. On his advice Major Rader went to Paint Rock and through all that country. He found no enemy and gained no information of any other than small gangs of "White Cottons," who occasionally go through the country stealing, yet are too cowardly to fight. He found four Confederates this morning on the road who have been in Tennessee but who were making their way back across the river. These he brought in, and I have sent them to the provost-marshal. The commanding officer at Point Rock says a small squad occasionally cross the river, but never in force, and latterly but very seldom.

I am, your obedient servant,

THOMAS T. HEATH,

Colonel Fifth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry.
