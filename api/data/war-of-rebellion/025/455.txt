Send Colonel Mizner, with the Third Michigan Cavalry, through to Grand Junction and Bolivar, if necessary, to ascertain the condition of the road to our rear and to re-establish the garrisons, if they have been deserted. Send the balance back here.

Concentrate one of your divisions at Holy Springs and one at Waterford. I will give Quinby directions here. They will not move on toward Corinth without further directions, unless you get information making it necessary.

Two dispatches received. McArthur's division goes to Holly Springs to-night. Ross stop here. Will push cavalry to the north. If no cavalry at hand will send forward Marsh with brigade to-night.

Marsh starts soon with four regiments. Grierson is here; also Lee. Can use both to great advantage in heading off Van Dorn. Shall I keep both?
