These instructions did not reach me as soon as anticipated, and as a consequence I did not make this point as soon as directed. No effort, however, was spared on my part to be here on time. Colonel Minty could not have made his march by way of Sparta and accomplished what he was required to do in less time than he did it. He is certainly an able and efficient officer.

The portion of my train left at McMinnville, about 40 wagons, will be here on the 22nd with rations. To-morrow I send back about 25 of my wagons and all Colonel Minty's train for supplies.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
