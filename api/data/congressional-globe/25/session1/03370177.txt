Oct 1837.                      APPENPfft TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE._________________17:
25th Co}iG....lst Sess.                             Making public officers depositories—Mr. Pickens.                                           H. of Reps.
their, depreciated paper, after they had discounted
upon what they had no right to discount upon, (be-
cause they were, at the same time, receiving in-
terest upon the Government stocks,) that involved
us m the depreciated paper of that day It was the
folly of this Government, not its impoteney under
the specific powers of the constitution It was this
state Of things which the Government felt bound to
stop the progress of, and they, therefore, adopted
the joint resolution of 1816, declaring that they
would receive, in payment of the public dues, no-
thing but gold and silver, or the notes of specie
paying banks This, of course, threw depreciated
paper out of circulation, and stopped the issues of
spurious banks The Government was enabled to
enferce this resolution, because peace had been re-
stored and the resources of the country became ex-
panded, and if they had adhered to tha* resolution,
and never adopted the policy of receiving other notes,
you could have had, for all practical purposes, a
sound currency, according to the intent of the con-
stitution
It is the only control over the currency which the
constitution contemplates, whether enough or not,
has been questioned I contend that it is enough
for all safe puiposes You receive nothing but
gold and silver or its equivalent, and the result is
that the local banks are compelled to hav e that
which is as good as gold and silver, or their paper
will be run back upon them 1 admit that, if you
receive by law, as the permanent policy of this
country, the paper of local institutions, the result
will be that you aie compelled to resort to a bank of
the United States I maintain that if you receive
paper you cannot control •• and make it a sound
and equal cm rency under the constitution, except
by and through a national ban k There are but tw o
feasible modes by which j ou can regulate the cur-
rency The one is the mode provided tor under
the constitution, m the clauses to which I have re-
ferred, and which is the mode intended and pointed
out by our ancestois And ii yon attempt to throw
thisjGovernment upon that stupendous sj stem of
currency, which has grow n up m model n times, by
receiving the paper ot banks in Government dues,
then theie is no other possible regulation of it but
by a bank of the United States
But, sir, what a monstrous proposition is con-
tained in the second mode1 You declare that you
■will receive the paper of banks, and you chattel a
bank of the United States, and give it power to con-
trol all other banks, and, by subjugating the State
institutions through the creation of this check, jou,
at the same time, part with the power given lo yon
by the constitution, and confer it upon a set ot men
wholly iriespon«ible excep' to the stock! olders of
their bank, and reckless and regaidless of everj
thing save the interests ot the institution Sn m
ereating such an institution a  this, you create a
greatei evil than that w hich v ou intend to counter-
act
What would have been the result in 1813 and
14 if a '■unk of the United States had been in ope
íatioa? Why, the Government being m difficulty,
instead of boi rowing from the local institutions as it
did, it w ould have borrowed, in all probability ii om
that bank, that bank would have discounted upon the
credit of the Government, as the others did, and
the Government being unable to meet its debt, the
notes of the institution would have fallen below
par, as thoae of the local banks did, and you would
have had precisely the sam" state of things as did
take place And then nothing could have sustain-
ed the bank but the powei of the Government to
receive its no Co as gold and silver, although not
convertible, and tins Government credit would
have giv en it pow er and control ov ei other banks
without the slightest met it It is absuid to talk
about the bank sustaining the Governmert The
Government can sustain the bank but not the íe-
verse The cicdit of restoring the currency is due
to the Goveinmem, undei that noble instrument,
the constitution and not under th  bank
But, su,   will  )ou part with youi  power—the
power to  com  money  and legulate  Us   , able—a
Eower that is one of the gievtest, and highest attn
utes of sovereignty 1 And if you make paper mo
ney the cmrenev of the Government, then the
power that regulates it, is as high and sov ereign as
the power that now makes com and fixes its \ al"a
And let gentlemen recollect that, if they once part
with it on the policy of creating a bank institution
it is not to last for this 5 ear or the next, but for-
ever, for that which is sound policy m regulating
the currency now, will be so fifty i/íutí hence, and
it must become a blanch of Government, perma-
nently engrafted upon the institutions of the coun.
tiy And are we prepared to saj, that those who
are to manage it, are for ever to be puie and en-
lightened men1 Recollect that the powei that
holds the su ay ov er the currency, holds a sway ov er
the fortunes of every man in this republic Sir, if
we once part with this power, my deliberate and
fitm conviction is, that we shall centialize a mo-
ne5 ed action in this countrj, which will, m the end,
make the labor of the confederacy virtually, and
for ever, tributary- to those who will have but little
interest in it I believe that nothing tended so
much to this as the establishment of the last institu-
tion    It is its natural and inevitable couise
Now, sir, what would be the results upon the ex-
porting sections of the countrj 1 Where would
you locate j our institution 1 Why, 3 ou must place
it where nine-tenths of the banking capital oi this
country already exists And what can be a gi eater
or more tremendous engine of power than this, lo
cated in a particular section orgamz ng with
system, and creating dependence mall the banking
and stock interests of the country"! You do noth
mg more nor less than give away the powei to
regulate the money and exchanges of the 'whole
countiy, to an institution located 111 the non export
mg section, and thus deprive, for ever, thepossi
bility of the exporting region of the country doing
its own importing trade Identify it with Gov ern
ment, by receiving m public dues its notes as gold
and silver, and you, m effect, loan the ciedit of this
Government, which is equal, annually to its rev e
nue and disbursements, to capitalists in s'ocks, for
their benefit—thus creating an artuicial ci edit, in-
stead of letting all mteiests, re«tmg upon their na-
tural resources and credit, reb finally upon the
productive industry and bona fide capital of each
individual or section
Is it not an extraordinary fact that nearly all the
expoits and imports of the exporting region of tins
confedeiacv, touches, both going and coining at
northern polls' Why is tins'! It has ensen flora
the fiscal action of this Government which his
heretofore sustained, and been identified with, the
banking capital of this country We have raided
the articles demanded in foieign countnes, and
they compel Us to touch, both going and coming,
at their ports This does not ¿use fiom then hold
ing the tonnage, or then bottoms, b it ¡hej hold the
credit or banking s\ stem, and by then connection
w ith the Government, create exchanges against us
and force us to touch for tribute Suppose im a
moment weweie separate States w ould if not be
abswrd for us, then to touch at fore gn Doits'! Let
theie be no central monev ed pnei 1 th vv Inch the
fiscal action of the Government shall become iden
tilled, and die export region will ¡do itsownim
ports thiough its own pons With onr local cur-
rency, resting as it does on ti ese artioes which go
into the markets of the world fifteen per cent <hs
count in New York we can never affoid to sustain
the state of things that has existed heretofore
Without a bank, identified with Government the
exports of the country must, to a great extent be
come a substitute for all foi nian and even domestic
bills
Mr Chairman, in looking ovei  the statistic  oí
the past, I find, that in 1769, Virginia and Mary-
land impartid, in amount   851,110 pounds sterling

with no g 1 eat variation whenever thmpsvveie not
deranged bj war, up to 1788 and 17^')    The exnort
region did its imports, and although it w as ot course
generally in foieign 01 Britist bottoms, v et it nevei
touched at two pints   but went aid came nnee'lv
through our  own  ports     But   things  have  now
changed   anu we have lost onr reliti e propo-tia
Trade was then sufeied to ta e us nali r I crian
nel      Since  then   howevei    the  pohtical  power
togelhei wi'h ihc monevecl power has been worked
asamst us and our trade is now co npell 'd to to tch
where nature never intended    I contend tha1   as
far as the fiscal action of this Go ernmenf is now
conceined we are vvheie we were  under the am
cles of the confedetation   audi foi ™ie c'esiie foi
the piesent to keep there     And   «1     1   is under
these convictions and beliet mg this to be the ope
ration of things, that I feel bound to make ihe trae
issue novpresented by the bill under consideratiQD.
Í contend that this oigamzation of the banking
power of the country connected with the Govern-
ment, tends directly to the result which I have
attempted to show, that is, to make the labor of
the exporting region of the country tributary to
those who hold nme tenths of the banking capital
in their hands I call upon gentlemen to consider
well before they make this plunge We have some
deeply mterestirg que^ions before ns intimately
connected with the pow er and ascendency of sec-
tions, and the des'mv of tins republic Sir, I have
been heie for three years, and watched theprogress
of tms abolition fi ehng which is now spreading
itself over half of this confederacy When it was
first brought into this hall, it was viewed with
indifference as the excitement of a few bigots and
fanatics But no v in the short progress of a few
years, we find that it has penaded all society with
intense anxiety That speck, which was at first
scarcely visible to the naked ej e, has now grown
blacker and decpet, until ovei one half of oui horizon
hangs a dark and gloomy cloud, through which
the thundei lolls and the lightning flashes, and
this temple, under  rhich we all have heietolore
gathered lor common pi o ection is destined to rock
and to tei amid the desolating whirlwind and rusk
ing tomado It 1 as assumed of late somewhat a
different shape
But gentlemen need not be deceived by the color
given to the Texas quemón Do you suppose it is
opposition to Texas ' No It is opposition to that
vital -interest in this confederacy with which we aie
identified—a deep pervading opposition, grown up
liom education and n^ancv, and paitaking now
even of the 1 elisio is sympathies of the communi-
ty—and 1 tal upon gcntl men to pause before
they are willing to thiow the power and the credit
of this Gov en ment mt the hands of capiti lists who
are at var with us, not onh in mterest but in feel-
ing and in ■■vmv tHy Organize again the banking
interests of this ccntederacv and < onnect 'hem with
Government, and you eatiuotest ape from the grasp.
I cannot look upon the iuiure without feeling the
deepest (unless ^e aie ftiitoouiselves at this junc-
ture) and most solemn apprehensions, that that pei-
>ccuteel and slandeied countrj which now stretches
itself from the banks of this noble river to the
mouths of the Mississippi, rich in character, rich
111 intellect rich in the gloiy ot the past rich in all
tho e qualities which make a gitat anda gallant
people w ill m progress of time be laid low in rum
and desolation with cmh hue and there a solitary
inhabit mt to trace out upon de erteel tombstones,
those obht°r"tcd lette's w nic" tiansrmt to posterity
the names of our mightv dead, and then lo shed over
them a burning tear
Sir, it is the fiscal acti m of fhis Government con-
nected with the bam mg nower that has 'ended to
chaw from us our s ibsf anee fir forty yeais It is
the v ainpu e tint ñas fe 1 lpoa ou- life blood and oui
vitals and I lui one a n 1 ot preraicdto peí peínate
it or sanction its 1 ene vv al
But, Mr Cnairman,gentlemen say, in opposition
to this bi'l that it is impracticable, and that the Gov-
ernment will findgieai difficulty m getting along
with it Sn, that fu m lies no objection m my
m nd I love a Gov en ment the better that moves
with dirhcultv Despo ¿sms onlj move va. untram

in difficulty C< beet your taxt s vv ith difucul j and
the consequence is that jou never w ill find people
willw  to pay taxes for distribution upon lawless
and unconstitutional ob ects No sn The diffi

measure to m° Vv hen Mi Fox visited Paris, at
the time Napoleon vv as m the haeht and pride of
Ins gloiy, the fiisc cmsuldcsi ed to know something
of he opeiation ot ihe trial by jury, with a view to

Mr Chairman, inanv mav suppose that I am

connection of the 1 rnking system with the povvpr
and credit of ill s Gov lrmertt, but sir, I have ~een
eaough to fear and uead it la 1832, v^hen tho
