Leave for the present Buckland to defend Memphis and district. His brigade, with Grierson's cavalry, can and should hunt up Forrest and whip him.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

CULPEPER, April 16, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Washburn is ordered to Memphis. General Hurlbut relieved. I will order Hunt or Prince to command over Brayman. Washburn will obey your instructions and establish no posts, except wherever your order them.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 16, 1864-10.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT, Culpeper, Va.:

Send Washburn to Memphis, and I would be glad to have Hunt at Columbus. In making up our fighting force we have left inferior officers on the river. General Hurlbut has full 10,000 men at Memphis, but if he had a million he would be on the defensive.

The force captured and butchered at Fort Pillow was not on my returns at all. It is the first fruits of the system of trading posts designated to assist the loyal people of the interior. All these stations are a weakness, and after tempting changes for plunder.

In a day or so there ought to be enough of McPherson's troops at Cairo to clean out Forrest without materially delaying our concentrating along the front.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 16, 1864.

General BRAYMAN, Cairo:

General Grant is offended at the timidity displayed at and about Memphis, and has ordered General Hurlbut to be relieved. I have instructed General McPherson as soon as possible to transport his wagons, mules, &amp;c., up to Clifton and to make up a force to strike inland from the Tennessee at Forrest. Make your dispositions to that end.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., April 16, 1864.

General McPHERSON, Huntsville:

General Grant is properly offended at Hurlbut's timidity, and has ordered me to relieve him. I have ordered him up to Cairo. General Washburn will be ordered by General Grant to Cairo, and General Hunt to Columbus.
