OLIVER MATTHEWS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CEDAR CREEK, November 4, 1864. [Received 10 p.m.]

Major-General CADWALADER,

Philadelphia:

I have sent four regiments to Martinsburg. They will report to you in Philadelphia as soon as they can be transported there by railroad. I want them sent back immediately after the 8th instant. Colonel Bassett is in command.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

NEW YORK, November 4, 1864-12 m. [Received 1.30- p.m.]

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

When I saw you a fortnight ago to-morrow, you told me you would ask General Grant to send me 5,000 troops, of which I informed you I wished to place 3,000 on the frontier. Not only in reference to threatened attack, but to secure the efficient execution of the order in regard to the colonizing from Canada for the election, and that I would retain 2,000 in New York. If I cannot divide the force under General Butler, two of the chief objects in view will be defeated. I will give General Butler, as is due to his rank, the choice of remaining here, or of taking command of the two northern districts of New York and State of Vermont, including Albany, Buffalo, and Saint Albans. If his force must not be divided, I will send into those districts the troops garrisoning forts in this harbor, although they are altogether inadequate to the object in view.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

NEW YORK CITY, November 4, 1864-3 p.m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have arranged the matter with General Butler to his satisfaction.

JNO. A. DIX,

Major-General.
