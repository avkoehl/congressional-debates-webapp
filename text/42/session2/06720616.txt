APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[June 3,
Senate.
Senator from Kansas.—Report,,
42d Cong.,..2d
to be heard. I told Mr. Yail and. Mr. Well?
that any friendly act I could do for him I
would gladly do ; that I saw Mr. Bollinger had
some little advantage in having complied with
the provisions ofthelaw. With Mr. Wellsl^ent
before the committee on elections and asked
the committee to give Mr. Wells ten days'
time in -which his evidence might be taken, and
prepared a resolution to be submitted to the
house of representatives, that a commission
be appointed by the speaker to go to Marshall
county and take the evidence, and report within
a period of ten days. I only appeared once
before the committee on elections. A member
of the committee on elections reported that
resolution, which was passed by the hou.se.
The commissioner was sent and the evidence
was taken. Mr. Wells never paid me anything
for it; I never made any demand for it. Mr.
Pomeroy never spoke to me about it; he had
no conversation with me about compensation
either being agreed upon or mentioned. It
was an act of friendship toward a client, and
as a man who was interested in local, matters
from our county. Mr. John D. Wells is here;,
he is a farmer. I took a little more interest in
the matter because Mr. Bollinger was an attor-
ney in his county, and had, as we supposed,
prepared his case to get a little advantagei of
Mr. Wells in the contest.
By Mr. Pomeroy:
Question. Was Mr. Wells for or against me
before you saw him ?
Anstoer. Mr. Wells was elected to vote for
Mr. Pomeroy's election, and Mr. Bollinger
had been elected to vote foy a gentleman
named General Lee, now residing, at New
Orleans. Before anything was said it was the
understanding and expectation that Mr. Wells
would support Mr. Pombroy out of regard for
that vote in his constituency. We have a rail-
road running from our city right through the
portion of the county where Mr. Wells resides,
and that portion of the county is locally in-
terested with ns, while the northern portion
of the county is connected by a railroad with
St. Joseph, aud Mr. Bollinger resides in the
northern portion of the county, and locally he
is opposed to our interests.
Question, Did Mr. Wells vote for me?
Answer. I know he did vote for you.
Question. Did he vote in a way to disap-
point my friends at all?
Answer. No, sir; he voted in accordance
with the wishes of his constituents, and was
afterward reelected. Upon the contest in the
election case the messenger we sent out was
not able to or did not get the evidence we
hoped, and the house decided the seat vacant.
The candidates then went back and ran again
and Wells was elected. At the next session
or a subsequent session Mr. Wells was re-
turned again.

eroy was supported by the Central Branch
road, I mean this : the southern portion of our
county where I live are in favor of the Central
Branch road, and they supposed Mr. Pomeroy
could help it in Rome way ; and Lee was in
favor of the St. Jo and Denver road, the
northern road, and Mr. Bollinger and T ran on

Question. Governor Carney, the Senate has
referred to us the charges of corruption at the
time of the election of Mr. Pomeroy* in 1867,
and we are investigating ,tbat matter now.
If you know anything in reference to any im-
proper means being used in 1867, at the time
of the election for Senator, by Mr. Pomeroy,
for the purpose of procuring his election, you
will please state them.
Answer. Well, I do not, Senator. I ttras
not in a condition to know much of Senator
Pomeroy's operations at that time, as I was
his opponent, and not supposed to know what
he was doing. All I knew was from common
rumor.
Question. Then yon say you know nothing
of. your own knowledge in reference to any
improper means to procure votes on the part
of Mr. Pomeroy ?
Answer. No, sir; I cannot call any to mind.
I do not know anything of my own knowledge
that I can now call to mind.
Question. You spoke of common rumor;
was that what we call "rumor in, the air,"
mere general talk, or some specific thing by a
person professing to have knowledge of it?
Answer. Well, it was, of course, what I
heard coming second-hand. For instance,
Judge Thatcher stated that Senator Pomeroy
had told him his election had cost him a for-
tunej that it, had cost him a fortune to beat
me. Three or. four other parties told me that
the Senator had' said to them it cost him a
fortune to beat me, or other words to that
effect
Question. But did not specify how?
Answer. No, sir; did not say how; only in
j general, terms.
