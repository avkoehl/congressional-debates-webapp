The amendment having been read Mr Bei*-
Tas proceded to sta'e the nature, and to con ra t
Ihe-cbaracers, of the two propositions nvolved by
the biH, and the amendment, and to s ow them 10
be antagonistic to each other, and wouhy of ver
different fates—one condemne 1 by th > Constitu
turn, by patriotism, by honor,by c mrv n decency,
the other commanded and recommemlf d by every
obligation of constitutional dutj, tí honorablt
impulsion, ot patriotic feeling, and o decent re
gard -for the character of the Senair rr for the
welfare of the country. He first ex mined thi
I^stMbution bill, and rapidly exhibited its cha-
racter and nature undei the did rent a peen which
appeared to him to bathe most lmprrtant. He
said
This distribution sch"tne is a gross a id fljgra I
breach of the Constitunon, unmitigitel  by   tl
apology ot piecedent, or the plea of surplus r cc
Hue     It is the first bill of it, kind wb < h may 1 e

sident who may appiove it, will h ^e   ¡e honor
to have given a new wound to ihe  «"institution,

tmed, in all appearance,  to rec tve n   last dtatily

Conslitution was not made to divitlt   «soi ry o

attempting to divid> this money, we b iv< t > ma

the Senate, is seen ti be just whaievu i   nes s ,
to obtain the majority tf one which is nroe    irj t<

Hpose.   For raising revenue, there i a i <le ki

there w no rule laid down, and tht   oí itself,

and reduces every operation oí this k nd to whii
this case is seen to be—a mere css<, cf pluttde '
the old States plundering the yum  i tie ' and  h

the expenses,  or to pay the debts <>'   he Govert -
wients yet this bill raises revenue im-xthe land
for neither purpose, and imposes ih   necessity

have been too loig neglected To neglect them
still linger, and to throw away, or squander among
the States, or lo give the Briti h tle land revenue

consummation of human folly and would seem to
justify the monarchical belie' that the elective

of self government Th? bill is forbid by the Con-

The military and naval boards whitii hive beett
