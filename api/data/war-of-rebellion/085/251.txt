I have had Captain F. L. Parker organize 100 picket men at Sedalia under Order 107 for active service and bush fighting - call themselves Rosecrans Rangers. As this comprises all fighting men, I desire very particularly to arm them well. I respectfully ask that they may have carbines. Can it be done?
