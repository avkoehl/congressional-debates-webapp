Raleigh, N. C.:

Nothing new to-day. Pacific railroad up all day. Clark's substitute for Crittenden's resolutions adopthed by Republicans yesterday-six Southern men on floor withholding votes. Cameron moved reconsideration. Gritenden's resolutions may pass Senate; probably not the House. Government will not attempt to retake forts; want peace; will avoid collision, but defent Sumter and Pickens if attacked. Holt nominated Secretary of War to-day. Will be confirmed. His friends say is opposed to coercion. No excitement here.
