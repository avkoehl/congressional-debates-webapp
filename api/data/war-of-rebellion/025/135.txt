JACKSON, July 29, 1862.

General McCLERNAND, Bolivar:

Troops were started to Medon about 6 o'clock. I could not get a car sooner. You can dispose of the troops at Toone's Station as you see proper.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

JACKSON, July 29, 1862.

General McCLERNAND:

I have just heard from Major Stewart; he is moving to Brownsville. Shall I send Colonel Hogg there to meet him? He reports Jackson's cavalry all crossing the Hatchie at different points. Has taken two prisoners. Reports an advance upon Bolivar.

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, July 29, 1862.

General LOGAN, Jackson:

Let Colonel Hogg proceed carefully in direction of Medon, thence, if possible, toward Denmark, and inquire for and co-operate with Major Wallace. Colonel Lawler's brigade, except details, will march toward Estanaula so soon as I hear from Tuttle.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.

DENMARK, TENN., July 29, 1862.

General LOGAN:

I am camped here for the night. There is evidently a considerable rebel force in the neighborhood.

If we have a fight to-night I will burn the town to make light. In the morning I will push on toward Brownsville. I am satisfied that Stewart is cut off. I will keep you advised, however, if the result should be different.

We are all wide awake and ready for any emergency.

HARVEY HOGG,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-A force of 150 Mississippi cavalry passed through here toward Brownsville at 2 o'clock p. m. This force was not the same that fought Stewart.

BOLIVAR, July 29, 1862.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

Major Stewart has had a hard fight with rebel cavalry. Has taken a number of prisoners and reports that he is pursuing his advantage.

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General.
