amending the militia law, but no answer came or action taken. in consultation with the governor and other prominent men of the Territory it was deemed most expedient and best courage the passage of a bill issuing Territorial bonds which would be cashed at par by moneyed men, and the same used to pay volunteers a bounty for three months' service and purchase horses on which to mount them (for there are none in the quartermaster's hands, nor any money to purchase them with), and these men were to be placed under my command and used in opening and keeping open the Overland Stage Route. The house and council could not agree o this bill; so after over two weeks' delay and no good resulting from their action, I was compelled to proclaim martial law, shut up all houses of business, stop all labor and traffic, and keep matters so until they furnished my 360 mounted men, which I would arm and equip. These men are now being raised, and I expect by the 20th to have the most of them in the field. My position has been and is anything but a pleasant job. Isolated from all support, a stranger in the land, cut off from a ll communication, threatened and attacked by hostile Indians, being in a community divided against itself, and compelled to proclaim martial law, with not a man at my back to enforce obedience to the same; yet I have succeeded by first stirring up the public mind and preparing it for the result which had to follow, unless I chose to back down and yield my authority, which no living soldier will do. I inclose for your information on this subject copies of a correspondence between myself, the governor, and the legislature on these troubles, also an article* from the Journal, a newspaper in the mountains, which will define to you my position and show you what I have had to counted with. I made it my business to visit the mountains officially on the very day when excitement was at the highest pitch; on the day but after that article was written. I addressed a meeting of abut 1,500 citizens in which I pointed out to them at whose door the blame lay, the duties they owed themselves and the 	Government, and my reasons for proclaiming martial law. I was unanimously sustained, and that night 120 men were sworn in for three month. This was te quota required by the governor to fill my call. I inclose you a copy of the order+ establishing martial law, as also the governor' call in accordance therewith. To assert your authority here in trying cases is very different from asserting it in any other portion of the Union. Men of influence and wealth in the East are interested to a very great amount in the mining companies, so that hey readily obtain an official ear in Washington to a one- sided story, which invariably works injustice to those in authority and responsible. I therefore respectfully ask, general, that you forward this, or a copy, to Washington that I may stand right onthe record. I am not afraid to assume any responsibility commensureate with the surrounding circumstances and which is for te good of the service, but I am afrraid of the snake- like winding of hypocrisy, backed by a groveling, sencual edeire. If men will adhere to truth I will cheerfully abide every issue.

In the hope this will prove satisfactory and of use to you in your amdinistration, and satisfy your mind regrding my positin and the steps I have taken in the premises, I ahve the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. MOONLIGHT,

Colonel Eleventh Kansas Vavalry, COmmanding.
