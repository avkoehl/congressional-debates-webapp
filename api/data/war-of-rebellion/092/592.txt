GENERAL; Yours of date November 30 just received. To the information conveyed about Lee, Hood, &amp;c., obtained from Hardee's officer, the General-in-chief says, "All right. " The army is moving and destroying railroad; the Left Wing is also moving.

HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Kent's Farm, opposite Station 8, December 1, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I have just returned to camp from Station 13. We have here a good plank road from our Savannah road to the river. About twenty-four feet of planking and stringers were removed from the bridge. We now have a good foot bridge, and will soon have repairs made so as to throw over cavalry and artillery, as well as infantry, if there should be need.

On the arrival of a company of the Twenty-seventh Missouri about forty mounted rebels departed in haste. I had the depot, a large quantity of lumber, ties, &c., and portions of the railroad track destroyed. I have directed General Blair to continue along the railroad, destroying it as he goes, and directed General Osterhaus to move opposite Numbers 7 to-morrow. I am a little in the dark as to your intention. Please inform me as far as you can consistently, that I may conform to your wishes as to the length of march, &c.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
