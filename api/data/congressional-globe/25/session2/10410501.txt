Pre-emption to settlers—Mr. Fell.
H of Reps.
with them 01 luring ■¡cores of them to locate valuable ttacts,
to commit toe gi ossest frauds against the pre emption laws and
their counti v And this, sir, is the system so highly eulogized
by the honoiable member flora minors, and for the extension
oí winch the present bill is intended Sir, as wise legislators,
when abou to pass an important statute we should look back
ti the ol 1 law, and ascertain the nils arising from, and,il possi
hie, endea\or ro pioutea remedy against then futureiecur
lence, but this bill, sir insteadof looking to a remedy, greatly
extends the evil Without intending any imputa'ion against
the honorab'e feenatoi, whoever he be, thatdiew the bill, I do
conceive, Mi Chairman, that, had his object been to cover up,
conceal, greatly extend and peipetuale all the speculations,
frauds, and peijunes ol the past system, he could not more ef
fectually hav e done it than by the present bill The ostensible
object of former pre emption laws was to protect the poor set
tiers in the little homes they had hewed for themseh es in the
forest, and so far as that object alone was honestly pursued, I
am not disposed to quarrel with the system, but the present
hill thiQWs off the mask, and its object would seem to be less
ro protect the óoíia/íde settler than the speculator or fraud u
lent pre  mptionei Tormer laws, sir, requirednot only settle
ment, but actual culm anon, though, under the construction of
the Commissioner, the most trifling effort to cultivate, even the
sowing of a lew turnip seed, was held sufficient, but the pre
sent bill, s fu fiom xorrectmg that fiaudulent constiuctnjii
and practice undei it and requiring a real (iiltivation ni good
laith, has stucken out the íequirement altoeethei, and made
mere settlement alone sufficient
Again sir; no length of settlement in connection with cultiva

of November hate erected a booth oi cabin on the mostvalua

s oner, an ndmdual under tlio lormer laws, who seected a
wa er p >u 11 and settled on the adjacent land and erecte 1 a mill,
still had no pie emption light without the actual cultivation of
the land, luitundei this bill neithei the erection of a mill, nor
ihe cultivation of the land, noi any thing else but a few hours'
settlement and the election of a shantee, is necessary to confei

mention this   n to show the extent to which the pro emption

and elected tkinduuw^e mm mimpmio
I am opposed Mi Chairman, to the whole pre emption sys
tern I believe its operation to be unptst and deleterious It
gives a rnos,, unjustadvantage to the few recklessover the many
honestly disposed by enabling the former to obtain the choice
lands at tl e lowest price It enables the wealthy speculator, 1 y
employ ngst íesol pie empuoners to amass a fortune,at the
expe ise if lie G iveinmentand the poor honest settlers It
lure men 1 eyond the protection and influence of si ciety, edu
cation, and teligion, to become the lonely settlers m the dence
lorest and b> teaching them that the laws foi thepiotection of
the public domain maybe violated with impunity, it has a moat
demnialumg effect upon the state of society This system,
Mr Chairman, is based upon false principles it enables men to
take dvantageof their own wrong, and compels Government
toyjfld o the force or the fraud of the few on the many, singly
or combined It «ays to the honest law loving and law abiding
citizen > on may acquire a right andan advantage over youi
neighboi, by violating the laws of your country The pi met
pies of the pre emption system, if carried out, would destroy all
government, and dissolve the very e'ements of the social com
act
Again  Mr Chairman I do conceive though I say it with all
defeience for the better judgmert and the more enlarged mtelli
gence of honorable gentlemen fiom the West, that thissystom
is unjust and injurious to the new States themselves    The prt
mary interests, sir, of those States are to increase and condense
population within their own borders, whilst the effect of this
system  sir, is to scatter population, and drain those States of
their inhabitants, bv emigration into the wilderness tor the bene
fit of pre emption    Sir, it is not the citizens of the old, but of
the new the border States, who go in advance of the land sales,
and of the public surveyni, to settle on the rich soil  or by the
now mg stream of the fprest   I recollect, sir, semi years since,
being in the State ol Kentucky and noticing that the spirit of
emigiation was much more ufe there than in mv own State
The tiavellei, sir, was constantly met by families and caravans
of emigrants, leaving the rich lands of that noble State, and
seeking a home in the far West and never, sir, was I so forcibly
reminded as on that occasion of thettufti, as well as poetry, of
the oft repeated line from Berkeley
Westwaid the star o empire takes its way
Sir this system not only deprives the new States of their in
habitant , but it reduces the value of their lands, for by reducing
the best Go\ eminent land toadollai anda quarter, the best
settled land must be reduced in the same ratio, and these settlers
on the public land get a long credit, and prevent their being pur-
chased at Governmentsales, and are foryears exempt from pay
ing taxes to the State
I am Mr Chairman, opposed to this whole system, because
i is peouharlyunjust to the old States I cannot, sir, but view
it as one of those measures calculated, it not intended, to
depuve the old States of all interest in the public lands By
enabling the settler to seleci (he best lands, and thus leaving
the poorer unsold foi years, it Co operates with, and provides
for, than plan of gi aduation so long talked of, and now before
the Ilouse foi final action, and thus the annual proceeds and the
aggregate value of the land will be reduced to a mere cipher
These lands, sir, even what was formerly designated ihe Ciown
lands, wrested ft im the British nation by the blood and treasure
of the "old thnteen" States and after some controveisy, weie
eventually ceded by the States within whose limits they were,
to the nation, to lie used as a common fund to pay pff the debt
of the sevei al States and the nation and foi ihe "only use and
bs nefit of such of the /Stales as have or shall come into the
Union ' lhal debt, the cost of the Revolution sir which has
been stated by the lieasury Department at #135,193703, has
been paid off by the sales of the public lands for the amount
paid by pinchaseis i-. stated at ¡8100,34565b 88 and if to this
be ad led ihe value of twenty eight and a half millions of acres
granted in bounties and to Suites and colleges, the aggregate I
appiehend, will moic than discharge the Revolutionary debt
and that incui red by the pinchase of Louisiana and Flonda, at
all events the Revolutionary debt has been paid off, and the
States have aught to a distubution of the futuie proceeds
accoidmg to Ihe letms of the compacts of cession The pie
sent estimate of the quantity of the public 1 mds is 292,000 000
alies within tl estates and Teiritones, and 750 000,000 beyond
th m,and iheamtuBtol land soldsinceli?0 is rising 61,800,000
acre*-, being about 3,000 000 acies annually, the nett proceeds
of which ib something over one dollar per acres and if the
annual nett proceeds were distnbuted among the States the
proportion coming to New lersey annually would be ovei
$70 000—a sum sufficient to pay all her State and county taxes,
oi to edúcale all the poor childien m the State Ami this
amount would be not loi one oi two years, but it would require
more than eight) years to dispose of those lauds lving within
the States an 11 pintones andcentunes foi the disposition of
the millions that lie beyond
In prospect, sir, of this immense lesouice for the replenish
mentof the empty State ticasuries, New Jersey was one of the
last States to join the Confederacy without a guaranty that the
Crown lands, which shoulo be obtained by the jomteffort of all,
should he a common fund for all the Status, but sbedidcomein
without such guaianty, eloquently appealing to  her  sisier
States forthejusticeofher claim and that appeal, sir, wasmag-
nammously responded to by New York, Virginia, and the other
Sta es whose limits en braced the public lands      NewJoisey,
sir, at that ti> ing time was peculiaily situated    She extended
about as fir from the coast as the rays of civilization had then
penetrated, whilst all beyond was shiouded m one vast wildet

PRE-EMPTION TO SETTLERS.
REMARKS OF MR. YELL,
Of Arkansas,
/ti the llmtie of Representative1!, Juiu 14, 1838—On
the bul giaviimg Pre-emption Rtgh>.
Mi Speaker I «ouldnoi now trespass on the al-
ready nearly exhausted patience of the Hou^-e,
were I not disposed to place myself in a correct
attitude before the people <f my Stale Sir, I re-
present a people who are tenacious of their rights,
who at all times hold their representatives respon-
sible ft r their acts, and as I am ever ready to ac-
knowledge myself bound to obey their wishes,
whilst I consult the good of my country, I should
be guilty of gross injustice to myself, and of ne-
glect towards them, if I should see thts bill pass,
and not, on my part, make a solitary effoit to in-
form them how I stand in relation to it
The importance of this measure is not fully un-
derstood by gentlemen from the old States, or by
those sections of the Union where the vexed ques-
tion of the rightful mode of the disposition «f the
public domain has been but little agitated. Whilst
I do not intend to cast any censure on gentlemen
commg from the sections of the Union ¡o which I
have made reference, and whilst it is far from my
design to accuse them of aupmenees or neglect ot
duty, I must be permitted to say that, it they had
studied the subject, fully and elaborately, ox visited
the West, thej would not now be found arraying
themselves against a proposition that is founded tn
right, and must eyer be attained by the immutable
principles of justice.
Tn making these remarks, I shall be justified in
exempting* from their application the example set
by one of the most distinguished sons of New Eng-
land. The gentleman to_ whom I refer is, as his
political life will show, a friend to the settler and
the West Sir, that statesman, some ten or twelve
months since, for the purpose of making himself
familiar with the wants of the West, her resource?,
her lawful desires and legitimate rights, visited
that region of the country, and from hisxiwn per-
sonal observation obtained that information which
taught him the correctness of the doctrine of pre-emp-
tions, and strengthened him in advocating the rights
of that class of Western Americans who have been,
and now are, reproachfully denominated squatieis.
Mr. Speaker, jou did me the honor, at the com-
mencement of this session of Congress, to place
me on the Committee of Public Lands, and, in
the hands of that body, this bJl, with all its de-
fects, (if any it have,) received its sanction. 1
voted tor it in committee, and I am ready to sus-
tain it in its pilgrimage through this House, If I
had kept my seat, and suffered the bill to march it 
"lonely way" in silence, I might be accused, and
probably with some propriety, with being indiffe-
rent about its passage To escape the possibility
of such an accusation, I take my stand in favor of
the bill, and, whilst 1 shall occupy the floor fof a
br  f period only, I shall respectfully ask your at-
tention and indulgence.
Mr Speaker, it has pleased an honorable gen-
tleman from Massachusetts, [Mr. Lincoln,] a gen-
tleman who, notwithstanding his ardent opposition
to all my political predilections, I esteem for the
soundness of his head and nobleness of his heart,
to introduce an amendment to the bill, which, in
my opinion, is decidedly and directly destructive
of all Ihe objects and designs of the advocates of
pre-emption rights.
Sir, I am not at all disposed to say aught that
canjuijliy be ascribed to an offensive and querulous
disposition towards the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, and I trust that he will exercise that liberali-
ty of sentiment which should characterize us all in
our conduct in life.
And what is the amendment that the gentleman
from Massachusetts propos.es? Here it is-
"Insert in the 36th line, after the words 'United
States,'and upon the third proviso, in said bill, the
following words
"Nor shall the benefit of this act extend to any
person who has before availed himself of a pre-
emptive right to the entry of any of ihe public
lands, and acquired a title thereto by reason of such
entry."
As I am not disposed to do the gentleman from
Massachusetts an act of injustice, I must, in the
exercise of that charity which I hope I shall al-
ways practise, maintain the opinion that that gen-
tleman, at the time he conceived his amendment,
was not fully aware of the baleful operation it
would have on the bill, and on the people of the
West, if, by any untoward providence, it were
adopted The gentleman cannot and has not ad-
vanced a solitary plausible reason to support the
hypothesis he hai assigned.
The amendment of the honorable gentleman
from Massachusetts proposes to exclude from alt
participation in the benefits of this bill all who have
heretofore received the benefits of the pre-emption
laws which have existed and expired. Sir, this
proposition is an attempt to restrict the liberal and
legitimate provisions of this bill, and if it should
be sustained, it would operate with great hardship
and seventy, not to say oppression and injustice,
on my constituents—on the whole united West.
A simple statement of the facts connected wi b.
this bill, and with the objects it contemplates, will,
I hope, satisfy this House of the injustice of the
gentleman's amendment, and prevent its adoption.
