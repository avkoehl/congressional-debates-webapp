room for reduction in that branch of the public service, intend
edto promote that interest, in his opinion, it shoulrlbeenlarged
on a^raniJBcale, not by increasing our principal agents, so
jnurh as by an increase of these of the consu tar grade While
our commerce was increasing throughout the world, the next
cry we heard was economy and it appealed to him, that this,
coming from the quaner it did, was something like fulfil Urg
the old adage, by stoppi lg up the spiggot, and letting out at the
punghole t e hoped if gentlemen com oienced this kind of
economy, they would confine it to Naples, but cany it out to
all our other missions He thought, that they might find in our
civil list at home many bet/er objects for theexeioi«eof their
economical projects, than m our small and truly Republican
piplomatic Corps
Mr  1NGERSOLL said something m reply, the first part of
which was inaudible to the Reporter  When heard, he was ob
serving that the only ground he had formerly taken against the
mission had been that our minster had nothing to do    But the
Chairman of the Committee on Foreign Relations {¡VIr Cush
inoj) had given reasons to day m its favor which he had not sta
ted on the former occasion reasons which were more than suf
ficient to justify a continuance of the mission   Theiewascom
rnerce enough, and much more, between us and Naples to jus
tify the expense of a mission if theie was any piospect of ef
feeling a treaty    Mr I  was m favor, as the gentleman fiom
Virginia had suggested, of exterding our foreign commercial
relations but he thought that object might be effected simply by
an extension of our consular system this would secure the be
nefits without theexpense of multiplied foieign missions,  but
when a trea y was to be negotiated, we  wanted, of course, a
minister to make it    Mr Í   objected to the Sena re's inter rei
ing, without very good reasons indeed, with an appiopnation
original'ng m that branch of the Government to winch the puise
was more immediately commuted    He was for asserting the
constitutional independence of the House, even although it
should be at the expense of that perfect harmony which the
gentleman from Massachusetts thought of such extreme value
Mr I concluded with saying that he should not insist on the
objection he had before urged against the continuance of this
Hussion.
1 he debate was further continued by Messrs McKEON IN-
GERSOLL,ADaMS, and FILLMORE,  and while the latter i
was s|_ eakmg                               "
Mesáis Wise and Stanlt were obseivedm earnest and ¡
excited conversation together at Mr Stanly's desk    After a !
few minutes Mr Wise made a motion as if to invite Mr Span   !
£¥/ out, to which Mr Stanly made a gesture of disaent    Mr
Wise then returned to Mr S and apparently as in answer to
something said by Mr Stanly, he was observed to slap Ml
Stanly m the face pretty severely with his open hand    A
scuffle then ensued, a number of members rushing to the scene
of contest.
The SPEAKER took the chair and called repeatedly to order
Mr Lewis was the first who was observed to separate the
combatants, holding one at each aim's length
Aitei a good deal of uproar and confusion-
Mr   WIsC having returned to his seat  rose and expressed
a hope that the House would come to ordei, and enable to
him to make to it an apology    He rose, he said, perfectly
cool and collec cd, to make an explanation-----
The uproar coitinuing—
Mi. KEtMwas heard to say that he objected to the gentle-
man going on until order was restored, and the members took
their eeats
Order being restored—
Mr WláB proceeded to say that he wished, in the most hum*
ble manner, to ask pardon, as he sincerely did, of the House, for
having, tn its presence, violated its order, and that decoium
and respect which should be preserved towards it, under an
excitement which he could not and would not repress The
House had witnessed what had passed between the gent'eman
from North Carolina and himself, and had heard the an°uage
used by that gentleman, in debate, towards him, [Mr Wise ]
He should not recapitulate it, but confine himself to what had
passed afterwards at the seat of the gentleman in private, and
not m the hearing of the Hou e, and with that alone he pre
BUmed, it will have any thing to do He had veiled the seat of
the gentleman [Mr Stanly] after he had conemded his re
marks, for the purpose of remonstrating with him m a friendly
and private way for his language m debate, ^nd without m
tending to manifest any excitement But he may have been,
and perhaps both of them were, excited His object was to
preserve their friendly relations, but the gentleman [Mr Stan
L>] chose to waive those relations, and to claim no protection
under them He would not undertake to inform the House
circumstantially of what took place The gentlem in seemed
disposed to a heie to what he had replied to mv explanation on
the a wr I attempted to give him a warning, and asked him to
go with me our ot the halt
Here Mr ANDREWS called Mr W  to order, and objected
to his making a statement
Mr WISE I make my general statement in presence of the
gentlemar [Mr Stanly] and no injustice can be done him
He refused to go out of tl e House with me, and lap dtedtoh'm
very harsh and offensive terms lh gentleman retoited a
word which I never can, and never will brook, here m t*ns
House or elsewhere I stiuck him and the a* J.uO ensned, for
which I again ask the pardon of the House, and submit myself
to the penalty it maj choose to inflict
Mr STANLY I, too, ask leave to make an explanation I
have no [ ardon to ask of the Hods , for if I had heen guilty, I
wojJd resign or submit to the judgment of the House The
gentleman from Virginia came round to my seat nut voremon
 trate, as he says but toxoid me as he has done eveiy body
who takes the liberty to diffei with a highmin led AVgmian In
the course of the conversation which took plat e between us, he
said to me, "I warn you " To which I replied 'I wait nore
of your warning " He then invited me tocóme with him io
the door Iiefused He then said 'you feserve mv contempt "
To which 1 replied "vou are a liar" He tried to strike me,
but was prevented fiom so doirg, and jf the House had n >t pie
vented me,I would have given him such punishment as he de
served
Mr, WHE said that the gentleman's statement was not true
Mr INGERSOLL rose and offered the following resolu
Won.
Unsolved, That a special committee be appointed to inquire
into the encumstances of the i encontré on the floor of this
House between Mr Wisb and Mr Stanly, members of this
House, and to repoit thereon to the House
Mr ANDREWS of Kentucky, w"d that at the last Congress
a committee had been appointed on a similar subject when
a similar ocsurrence had taken place How that investiga
tioo ended every body knew He was opposed to the appoint
ment of a committee Heconsideied the former occurrence
disgraceful to the House, as be consulted this He thought
that the two members engaged deserved to beexpeiltd, and lie
belies edthej shouid be expelled, now upon the spot, and with
outfurthei   elay
Theie was no othfi way in which the House could vindicate
its character and its, dignity The cimmutee appointed in a
similar case at the last Congress had done nothing—Jiad rerom
mended nothing—and the indignity which had been offered to
the House and the country went unpuniQhed and unrebu
ked He was for no committee—it would be a mere white
washing aflmr—a meie humbug, such as we had heretofore
had
Mr HOPKINS (after a remark which thefReporter could
not hear) moved the pieviou*: question
Mr ANDREWS moved to lay the resolution oí Mr Incer
soll on the table \vi h a view, he said, if that motion pie-Miied,

House, having this day by bis own confessions <. n the floor of
the House, while m session m Committee of the Whole on the
state of tho- Urnon, committed an assault on the Hon Edwahd
Stanly betherefoie expelled the House
Mi ANDREWS moved to Jay the íesolution on the table,
for the reasons above s'atod by him
Which motion wasiejected
The question then recurred on the motion of Mr Hopkins

And the main question (being on the resolution) was ordeied,
and being taken—

the amount appropriated by the bill (the one following the

IN SENATE.
Fribay, September 10, 1841
Mr. KING «aid he wished to present to the Se-
nate tbe preamble aud resolutions adopied at a
mee'mg of the Democratic parly oí Albemarle
county, Virginia—a county, of which the citizens
werp ab respectable, as patri( tic, and as intelligf nt,
as, those of any o hT county of that great Siate
He was sure that he vould have the concurrence
of the honorab'e Sena'or from Virginia [Mr. Rives]
in this remark and al*o that the gentlemen com-
posing this meeting «ere among the most
respectable cti'zens of the county. They d*>-
ny the power of Congress to create a Nati mal
Barb; they characterize the bill for ihe establish-
ment of the Fiscal Agent as an indirect and eva-
sive, and therefore more dangerous violation of the
Constitution; they say that the Disttibution bill is
unwarranted by the Constitution; they remonstrate
against the imposition of unnecessary taxes; they
regard the appropriation of $35 000 dollars to the
widow of President Harrison as an ureoniti ution-
a! expendituie of public mi nev, as an unjust dis-
crimination in favor ot one ofheer of (be Govern-
ment, if it be not a precedent; andas a wide path
to profligacy, profuseness and corruption, if it be;
ihey regard the suppression oí the freedom of de-
bale in the House of Representatives, as the most
deadly blow ever struck at our liberty; they
strongly condemn the doctrines of the Cir-
cular issued by the Secretary of State,
respecting the holders of office under the
Government; they assert the doc rme or repeal as
applicable to all laws of a public nature; they ap-
prove of the first veto of President Tyler; and con-
clude by expressing their deep regret that they can-
not send their Senator? in Congress these resolutions,
without an an appearance of disrespect, which they
do not intend. Mr. K said he took much pleasure
in complying with the request of the highly respe-
table gentlemen who composed this meeting, to
present the proceedings to the Senate, and having
stated their purpoit, he would not ask that they
should be read, without it was desired by the Senate.
He would say that while the language of the paper
was strong and fearless, such as becomes freemen
to speak, and freemen to hear, >t was perfectly de-
coróos and respectful. He would move that the
proceedings be laid upon the table, and be ordered
to be printed; which was agreed to.
Mr. TAPPAN presented the proceedings of a
meeting of the citizens ol Knox county, Ohio, ap-
proving the course pursued by the Executive in re-
lation to the bill for the establishment of a Fiscal
Bank, and condemning the policy and measares of
the dominant party in Congress. Mr T. said
this was a g'eat central county, and its inhabitants
were at leas>t as intelligent and respectable as any
other in the State. He moved that the proceed-
ings be la d upon the table and ordered to be
printed, which was agreed to.
On motion by Mr BERRIEN, the Committee on
the Judinary were discharged from the further
consideration of tbe resolution m relation to the
Peapatch Island in the river Delaware.
The resolution submitted yesterday by Mr. Ben-
ton, was agreed to.
The bill making appropriations for the salaries
and outfits of diplomatic agents was taken up, tbe
House having disagreed to the amendment of the
Senate -¡t'lking out the appropriation for the Hus-
sion to Naples.
Mr RIVES moved that the Senate recede from
itsamendment.
Mr MANGUM hoped the Sena'e would not re-
cede, and opposed the motion with much earnest-
n ss.
Mr KING replied to Mr. M and argued at
some length in favor of the motion to recedo.
The rrotion of Mr Rives was agieed to, and the
Senate receded from us amendment.
The Smate then proceeded to consider the
amendments of the H^use to th° bill to repeal the
sixth section of the act for the support of the Mili-
tary Academy oí the Uni'ed States for the year
1838, and to provide for the fume investment of
trust funds, and agreed to ihe House amendments,
and added the following a<s a new section:
"And be a further enacted, Tnatlhe three clerks authorized
hy iheaaof JuneSi, 1836 o ifsulatf the deposites of th«¡ pub-
lic money, he ird heieby ire directed to he leiamed and em.
ployed in the Tieasury Dcpirtment, as [ luvided in said act,
until the state of the ¡t bli business becomes such that their
services c tn conveniently be ditpei sed wuh "
Mr TAPPAN moved to take up the resolution
to fix a dav for the ?djourtment of Congress.
Mr. CLAY of Kentucky hoped the Senator
would WHhdraw his motion un'il ibe revenue bill,
which was now pend eg between the two Houses,
was deposed of \Vh~n that was done, he bad no
objection to takirg up and acting on the resolution.
The resolution tor the emplo>m-nt ot a Corps
of Repor'ers by the Senate, was taken up, and
Mr BAYARD exp'amed and advocated the pro-
priety of its adoption at some length
Mr SMITH of Indiana moved to amend by
giving the sppomtment of the Reporters to the
Vice President, instead of the Secretaiy of the
Senate; which wai disagreed to.
