All of the wagons of the corps, except cook wagons, ambulances, and enough of those of the supply train to transport what remains of the subsistence stores-four day's rations-now on hand, after issuing three day's rations, will proceed to Columbus, Miss., following the artillery on the road to Fulton. A quartermaster from each division will be placed in charge of the train of each division, and will report to Lieutenant-Colonel Williams, commanding artillery.
