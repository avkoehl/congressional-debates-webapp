to Brownsville,unless you have given him other orders. The general does not think it best to leave his force at Austin unless you consider it very important. Have not heard of the arrival at the Bluff of the troops from below. The Twenty-ninth Iowa and Marr's battery have just arrived from Lewisburg. Wire is repaired to the Bluff. General Andrews telegraphed that Geiger left yesterday at 12 with a little over 600 men.

Colonel GARRETT,

Austin:

Push forward the train to General West with such a guard as you think is necessary. Less then 100 would not be safe probably. When the train is fairly off return to Brownsville. If you happen to have a scout with you, have him secreted at Austin for a day or two to bring in intelligence of whatever rebel troops may pass through there.

The brigadier-general commanding direct that you forward the supply train to General West, with whatever guard may be necessary, and that you return to Brownsville with the command at Austin, unless otherwise ordered by General West. In the event of your moving back notify General West. Please forward dispatch to General West.

PINE BLUFF, ARK., August 28, 1864.

Major-General STEELE:

The scout sent down the river went about thirty miles. They skirmished with the enemy for several miles and found that it would be unsafe to proceed farther. The officer in command (Captain Wightman) is confident that the enemy have no means of crossing the Arkansas, except by flats. I will send out another scout upon a different road. I will have them go out toward Brownsville,and then take down the prairie, with instructions to go to Arkansas Post, if possible. I am satisfied that the enemy have not crossed below us in any considerable number.
