1868.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
1655
each colony had issued paper credits beyond
its ability to pay, and these paper credits were
still in circulation. The population of the
colonies at that time did not exceed two mil-
lion eight hundred thousand persons. Their
weal I h could not have exceeded five to six
hundred million dollars.
The amount of continental money issued
has never been accurately ascertained. Mr.
Hamilton estimated it at $357,475,541; Mr.
Gouge, in his ;work on banking, states it to
have been $337,470,541: an article in the
Merchants' Magazine for January, 1843, places
it at $387,47(3,337; the amount reported by
the Treasury Department to the Senate, in
1843, is estimated $242,100,170. It matters
not which estimate is the .correct one ; it will
be readily perceived that no such issue, should
the public debt be entirely converted into cir-
culating notes, can be possibly made now. It
was from eighty-six to one hundred and thirty-
seven dollars per capita, and from one half to
ths-ee quarters of the entire property value of
the colonies. The only thing surprising is
that the issue of the first twelve months main-
tained a gold value, and that it had only de-
clined fifty per cent, at the end of two years.
Our condition is quite different, too, from
that of revolutionary France when, on the 1st
of April, 1790, she entered upon a system of
paper issues. The property of Franco then
was not one third the amount of ours now,
and yet the issues reached $241,000,000, with
a decline of only ten per cent. When the
issues had reached $1,000,000,000 the discount
was only fifty-five per cent. When they
reached the extraordinary sum of $9,115,000,-
000—a sum much greater than the entire prop-
erty of the kingdom—it is not strange that they
became utterly worthless.
To determine the amount of money de-
manded by a people we must understand the
area of the country, the mode and manner of
doing business, and the proportion of the
population residing in cities having bank fa-
cilities. In England and France, where the
population is dense, much less currency is
needed. Bank cheeks and bills of exchange
supply in a large measure the place of a cir-
culating medium.
These advantages are enjoyed in a much
less degree in this country; hence a larger
circulation is necessary. The extent of our
country is great, and new Territories are being
rapidly settled up, from which communication
is exceedingly difficult. Another fact worthy
of consideration is that the old credit system
between individuals is almost entirely aban-
doned. When the Government supplies its
credit in sufficient quantities individuals are
enabled to adopt the cash system in business,
and, even though the Government credit should
fall below par, business men are compensated
for this inconvenience by the advantages of
cash payments. What they lose in discount
on the paper is less than the probable loss on
failuresof individual credit. Taking iuto con-
sideration, therefore, the character of our
country, the activity and energy of the people,
and the abandonment of the old credit system,
it may be safely assumed that double as much
circulation per capita can be used here as in
France or England.
In 1804 the gold coin of England was esti-
mated $400,000,000, and that of France at
$700,000,000. If these estimates were correct
at the time, it is safe to assume, looking at
our own recent exportations of the precious
metals, that the amounts have been largely
increased. If we include the silver coin and the
bank notes we may set down the circulation of
England at not less than from six hundred and
twenty-five to six hundred and fifty million
dollars. This would furnish twenty-five to
twenty-six dollars per capita. _ I have but little
doubt that the gold circulation of France is
now equal t.o $800,000,000. Add to this the
circulation of the bank of France, and we have
a per capita circulation about equal to that of
England.
Now, suppose the people of the United States
needed only as much circulation per capita as
the people of England and France, this would
give us over one thousand millions.
I am aware that the aggregate wealth of each
of those nations is greater than ours, and that
fact may modify my statement that we can
profitably use twice as much currency per cap-
ita as they. But suppose, on account of the
causes to which I have alluded, we can use
three dollars to their two. The circulation
of the United States in that event should be
$1,500,000,000. It is now much less than half
that amount.
I know the conclusions arising from these
facts will not be favorably received. The opin-
ion of many persons here and elsewhere is that
the old order of things ante helium cannot safely
be departed from. We have been told from in-
fancy that lai-ge issues of paper money are dan-
gerous, and we too readily confound a reason-
able exercise with the abuse of the privilege.
We do not take into consideration the change
of circumstances demanding a change of pol-
icy. Tn many things we have been recently
educated. Wre may have something to learn
yet in the school of finance.
Ever since our circulation in this iron policy
of contraction fell beneath a thousand million
dollars gold has risen in the market. Instead
of reaching specie payments, we are placed
almost beyond the pale of 'hope in that direc-
tion. The reason is apparent. There is no
gold in the country, perhaps not over $225,-
000,000. Hence present resumption by the
Government is the merest dream of enthusiasts.
State bank notes are prohibited by law, and
national bank notes are limited to $300,000,000.
Some form of credit must be furnished as a cir-
culating medium. Unless it is furnished in
sufficient quantities the productive energies of
the people are cramped. Money in some form
is essential among civilized men to the transac-
tions of business and the accumulation of
wealth. It is the nation's life-blood, which
alone can assimilate raw material into wealth,
beauty, and strength. Whenever it is denied,
under the absurd idea that its amount should
be limited by the law-making pewer, derange-
ment and disorder in business inevitably fol-
low. As well might the quack assume to
determine the quantity of blood necessary to
the health and vigor of the human system,
Mr. Fullarton, in his work on the Regulation
of Currencies, uses the following significant
language :
." With only oncor two exceptions, and those admit-
ting: of satisfactory explanation, every remarkable
fall (rise) of the exchange, followed by a drain of
gold, thai, li:is occurred during the lust half eentuiy
has been coincident with a comparatively low stato
of the circulating medium, and vice verm.
"On no occasion was this proposition more strik-
ingly exemplified than during the period immedi-
ately preceding the suspension of cash payments in
1797, when, l'or two years together, a system of the
most determined contraction was carried on by the
dircc tors ofthe BankofBngland with unrelenting per-
severance, reducing thecircidation from <£16,017,510 on
the 28th February, 1795, to £8,(140,250 on the 25th Feb-
ruary, 1797, without arresting, in the least apparent
degree, the drain of gold which was tlien in progress
for restoring the exchanges. The restoration of the
exchanges to its bullion par from a depression of full
thirty per cent, was accomplished in 1816, after various
remarkable vicissiliufes, in the lace of an enlarge-
ment of the issues of the Bank of England to an ex-
tent varying from thiee to six millions."
I could refer to fact upon fact in the history of
the past to illustrate this view ; but time forbids
at present. Now, if the policy I have indicated
be adopted, the country can afford to wail the
pleasure of the bondholders on the subject of
funding their securities into a new loan. If
they wish to keep the old bonds let them do so,
and we will pay their interest and trust the
future for solution of our difficulties. If the
debt must be funded in the present stringency
of the money market it would be far better to
aafoce the interest and pay the market rate of
flfSttunt on the bond. In this respect I differ
materially from the chairman of the commit-
tee. Even the Senator from Vermont admits
that the debt may be funded at five per cent.
On his theory of voluntary conversion this
is an admission that money may be had at five
per cent. Bat let us suppose money to be
worth six per cent., which strengthens the ar-
gument against me ; and yet I insist that, if
the debt is to be funded into a ten-forty bond,
the Government may save hundreds of millions
by issuing securities at a lower rate of interest
and placing the equivalent discount in the body
of the bond. The gain to the Government, of
course, arises from the difference of opinion as
to the period when the debt can be paid. Cap-
italists insist that it can be paid in from ten to
twenty years. I believe no such thing. But,
as they have the money, it is their judgment
and not mine which will likely control its
investment.
Now, suppose a six per cent, ten year bond
is worth par, then similar bonds at lower rates
of interest are worth as follows :
At five per cent $92 56
At fourpcr eont  85 12
At three and a half per cent   81 40
At three per cent  77 63
But our six per cents are really worth in
currcncy 109. The ten years' bonds of lower
rates should be worth as follows:
At five per cent $100 89
At four per cent    92 58
At three and a half per eont  88 72
At three per cent  84 90
Now, if we should agree to fund at the dis-
count in consideration of lowering the interest,
we must give for four per cents $106 93; for
three and a half per cents., $112 71; for three
per cents., $117 78.
Suppose, then, we fund $2,000,000,000 at
four per cent., we shall only increase the
amount to $2,138,000,000; at three and a half
per cent., to $2,254,200,000; at three percent.,
to $2,355,000,000.
I do not imagine that the principal of the
debt will be paid in the next fifty years. But
suppose it shall be paid in ten years, then
nothing will be gained, 1 admit, except the im-
mediate benefits arising from the reduction of
the annual interest budget.
The annual interest, at five per cent., is
$110,000,000; it would be, at four per cent.,
$85,544,400; at three and a half per cent.,
$78,897,000; and at three per cent., $70,-
068,000.
And now, if I am right in supposing that fifty
years will elapse before payment of th« princi-
pal, let us see what the nation will make by the
change? One dollar at five per cent, compound-
interest, paid semi-annually, in fifty years
amounts to 11.8137. Two thousand million
dollars, then, will amount in the same time
to $23,027,400,000. One dollar at four per
cent, compound-in-tcrest, paid semi-annually,
amounts to 7.2116. Hence the debt, if now
funded at that rate, would amount in fifty years
to $15,493,301,560; making a saving to the
nation of $8,134,098,440. The saving to the
nation, if funded at three and a half per cent.,
will be $10,778,460,000. If funded at three
per cent, the saving will be $13,027,200,000.
But suppose you reject the idea that the in-
terest should be compounded. Let us, then,
take it at simple interest, and see what the Gov-
ernment will have paid in actual cash on the
principal and interest when fully discharged:
$2,000,000,000 at five per cent, simple interest for fifty
years  $7,000,000,000
$2,138,600,000 at four per cent, simple
interest for fifty years  6,415,800,000
Saving $584,200,000
$2,254,200,000 at three and a half per
cent, simplo interest for fifty years... 6,199,050,000
Saving  $800,950,000
$2,355,600,000 at threo per cent, simple
interest for fifty years  5,889,000,000
Saving... &1,111,000,000
So it becomes apparent that the debt should
be funded at lower rates of interest, even if
we have to increase the principal for the priv-
ilege of doing so.
One good that may possibly be educed from
the existence of the debt—if there be good in.
