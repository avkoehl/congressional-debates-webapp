Numbers 3. Reports of Brigadier General Charles C. Gilbert, U. S. Army, commanding at Franklin, Tenn.

FRANKLIN, TENN., March 2, 1863.

I have had nothing since yesterday from Colonel Coburn. I have just sent for him to come to this place with his brigade. The enemy has been crowding my pickets for about an hour and a half or two hours. If the demonstration is a serious one, it will be with the forces of Van Dorn and Wheeler, estimated at 10,000. The report from the Carter Creek [turnpike] is that there is a battery in sight, but as it has not opened, I am not sure of the fact. The Michigan cavalry had just gone out, and before sunset I can give you something reliable.

C. C. GILBERT,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General GRANGER.

FRANKLIN, TENN., March 5, 1863.

Colonel Coburn has not made much progress along the Columbia pike. I can hear his guns not far off, probably not more than 6 miles.

C. C. GILBERT,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD, Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, FORWARD FROM FRANKLIN, March 5, 1863.

After some considerable success, Colonel Coburn has been repulsed, and the command is coming back. The artillery is safe, but some of the infantry has been captured.

C. C. GILBERT,

Brigadier-General.

General ROSECRANS.
