Captain Charles R. Lowell, Sixth Regular Cavalry, now on McClellan's staff. Also Lieutenants Clapp and Forbes, of First Massachusetts Cavalry, now on Potomac-the latter in Porter's body-guard. Please detail them at once to help me recruit the new regiment, in which I propose to promote them.

JNO. A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., November 3, 1862.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston:

If the officers named in your telegram of this date will procure the consent of their respective commanders to accept the positions you offer them, I will detail them. But if the Department were to detail an officer of staff or body-guard it would occasion bitter complaint, and perhaps delay a campaign.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HENRY L. STEVENSON,

New York City:

SIR: In reply to your letter of the 22nd October at to "whether such persons (civilians) who were residing in the South at the beginning of the rebellion, and who were compelled to give their parole not to take up arms against the Confederate States in order to obtain permission to come North, are not thereby exempted from the military service of the United States," I am directed to say that the parole must be respected.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, November 3, 1862.

If you will give Lieutenant Henry M. Neil a commission as captain I will authorize him to raise another company of artillery.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, November 3, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I will with pleasure appoint Lieutenant Henry M. Neil a captain if you will authorize a new battery.

DAVIS TOD,
