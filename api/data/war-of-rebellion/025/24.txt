HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,June 22, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Corinth, Miss.:

Your dispatch received. Davis' division has been ordered to proceed to Jacinto with instructions to look for and cover the best route to strike the Fulton and Iuka road.

A battalion of cavalry left Jacinto for Fulton at 5 o'clock yesterday morning. If the enemy are moving in force we shall hear from them to-day. Colonel Sheridan has been ordered to prepare three days' rations and be ready to move as soon as the scouts come in. Asboth is ordered to have three days' rations cooked and ready. He is some miles from Jacinto. It does not seem to me probable that the rebel main force will move on Iuka. Does he not wish to scatter us still more?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CORINTH, June 22, 1862.

Major General GEORGE H. THOMAS:

GENERAL: General Nelson telegraphs that the enemy is moving to attack him at Iuka. You will immediately march with your division to his relief and also the protection of the railroad beyond.
