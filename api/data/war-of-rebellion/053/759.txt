Major-General LORING,

Canton:

Ector's and McNair's brigades will follow Featherston's, which went to Brandon to-day; therefore you had better not engage in general action until they arrive, but delay the enemy as much as possible. The field transportation of Brandon and Canton will have to be used for all these troops; please arrange it.

Major-General LORING,

Brandon:

The following received from General Johnston:

If the enemy should be in the direction of Brownsville, Adams' shortest route would be from Moore's Ferry, by Calhoun Station. General Loring is far enough forward to direct these movements and fix the point of junction of the troops.

General Featherston's brigade is ordered to join you.

By command of General Johnston:
