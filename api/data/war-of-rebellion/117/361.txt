You do not belong to the Army of Virginia and will not make arrests except under orders heretofore or hereafter from these headquarters. The person you refer to will be released if arrested simply for refusing to take the oath of allegiance.

If the prisoners are to be exchanged the present guard will suffice; if not a new guard must be detailed or organized for Camp Morton, and I will attend to it.

General LAZ. NOBLE,

Adjutant-General of Indiana, Indianapolis, Ind.

GENERAL: Yours of the 2nd is received and I regret that I can give you no satisfactory reply to your inquiries. Indeed from rumors which I have heard and from delay in giving me instructions on the subject I will not be surprised if something has occurred to put a stop to the exchange.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, August 9, 1862.

Captain JAMES MOONEY, Rochester, N. Y.:

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

DETROIT, August 9, 1862.

L. THOMAS, Adjutant-General.

DEAR SIR: Are the boys of the Michigan First (Bull Run prisoners) exchanged yet? I promised them that it should be done at the earliest possible moment and now find them enlisting the supposition that it has been done. The list is with the Secretary of War. Our quota is full and the blood of the people us. They were yesterday paying $10 for a chance to enter some of the regiments.

Very truly, yours,

Z. CHANDLER.
