THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 27,
Mr. PIKE. Mr. Chairman, there was no
such instance, no such occurrence. The rev-
enue-cutter Mahoning did not take the district
attorney and high officials down to my district.
I will tell you what it did. It took distin-
guished Congressmen aboard and went over to
St. John's. Another revenue cutter, the Ash-
uelot, took a distinguished party of Congress-
men from Boston and went down along the
coast of Maine. They came to my town at
ten o'clock at night and left at daylight next
day. They enjoyed themselves, but there was
little profit to the service.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. As the
Maine law was in operation I ask whether they
went over to the British provinces "to wet
their whistles?" [Laughter.] I now move
that the committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
