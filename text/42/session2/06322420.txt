southwest comer of Missouri, and thence with the
western boundary line of Missouri till it crosses the
waters of Neosho, generally called Grand river ;
thence due west to a point from which a due south
course will strike the present northwest corner of
Arkansas Territory; thence continuing due south
on and with the present western boundary line of
the Territory to the main branch of the Arkansas
river; thence down said river to its junction with
the Canadian river, and thence up and between the
said rivers Arkansas and Canadian to a point at
which a line running north and south from river^ to
river will give the aforesaid seven million acres."
In addition to the seven million acres thus
provided tor and bounded, the United States
further guaranty to the Cherokee nation "a per-
petual outlet west, and a free and unmolested
use of all the country lying west of the west-
ern boundary of the above-described limits,
and as far west as the sovereignty of the Uni-
ted States and their right of soil extend."
It having been discovered, aftet the treaty
of May 6, 1828, that the above-described cor-
rected boundaries, made to avoid the territo-
rial or State limits of Arkansas, might now
interfere-with the cession made by the second
article of the treaty of February 3 4. 1833, by
the United States to the Creek Indians, the
Cherokee boundaries were again corrected, to
avoid this new difficulty, as will fully appear
by reference to the first, article of the treaty
of February 14, 1838, which provides that.—
"The United Statesagreeto possess the Cherokees,
and to guaranty it to them forever; and that guar-
antee is hereby pledged, of seven million acres of
land, to be bounded as follows, namely, beginning at
a point on the old western territorial line of Ark-
ansas Territory, being twenty-five miles north from
the point where the territorial line crosses the
Arkansas river; thence running from said north
point south on the said territorial line, where said
territorial line crosses Verdigris river; thence down
said Verdigris river to the Arkansas; thence down
said Arkansas to a point where a stone 'is placed,
opposite the east or lower banks of Grand river,
at its junction with the Arkansas; thence running
south forty-four degrees west one mile; thence in
a straight line to a point four miles northerly from
the mouth of the north lurk ot'^ the Canadian ;
thence along the said four-mile line to the Can-
adian; thence down the Canadian to the Arkan-
sas: thence down the Arkansas to a point on the
Aikansas where the eastern Choctaw boundary
strikes said river, and running thence with the
western line of Arkansas Tot ritory, as now defined,
to the southwest corner of Missouri; thence along
the western Missouri line to the land assigned the
Seneeas; thence on the south line of the Senecas to
the Grand liver ; thence up said Grand river as far
as the south lino of the Osage reservation extended,
if necessary; thence up and between said south
Osage line, extended west if necessary, and a line
drawn duo west from the point of beginning to a
certain distance west at which a hno running north
and south from said Osage line to said duo west line
will make seven million acres within the whole
described boundaiies,
" In addition to the seven million acres of land
thus provided for and bounded, the United States
further guaranty to the Cherokee nation a perpet-
ual outlet west, and a free and unmolested uso of all
the country west of the western boundary of said
seven million acres, as far west as the sovereignty
of the United States and their right of soil extend;
Provided, however, That if the saline or salt-plain
on the western prairie shall fall within said limits
prescribed for said outlet, the right is reserved to
the United States to permit other tribes of red men
to get suit on said plain in common with the Chero-
kees, and letters-patent idiall be issued by the Uni-
ted States as soon as practicable for the land hereby
guarantied.
"And whereas it is apprehended by the Cherokees
that in the above cession there is not contained a
sufficient quantity of laud for the accommodation
of the whole nation on their removal west of the
Mississippi, the United States, in consideration of
the sum of Jj5o00,0G0 therefor, hereby covenant and
agree to convey to the said Indians and their de-
scendants, by patents in fee-simple, the following
additional tract of land, situated between the west
line of the State of Missouri and the OsAge reserva-
tion, beginning at the southeast corner of the same,
and runs north along the east line of the Osage
lands fifty miles to the northea&t corner thereof;
and thence east to'the west line of the State of Mis-
souri; thence with said line southfifty miles; thence
west to the place of beginning; estimated to contain
eight hundred thousand acres of laud ; but it is ex-
pressly understood, that if any of the lands assigned
the Quapaws shall fall within the aforesaid bounds,
the same shall be reserved and excepted out of the
lands above granted, and a pro rata reduction shall
be made in the price to be allowed to the United
States for the same by the Cherokees.
"Art. 3. The United States also agree that the
lands a,hove ceded by the 1 reaty of February 1-1.1S>>,
including the outlet and those ceded by this treaty,
shall be included in one patent, executed to the
Cherokee nation of Indians by the President of the
United States, according to the provisions of the act
of May 28,1830."
The second article of this treaty releases the
United States from liability under its former
erroneously bounded parts of.former grants;
and by the fourth article of the same treaty
the United States accounts to the Cherokees
for losses sustained by them on account of
these errors of location.
In pursuance of the law of Congress and
treaties just quoted, the United States, on the
31st day of December, 1838, made and deliv-
ered to the Cherokee nation of Indians its
patent for said lands, rehearsing therein so
much of said law and treaties as was^ necessary
to a perfect showing of both, with a full
description of the lands consigned, as follows :
granting clause of patent to the cherokees.
Therefore, in execution of the agreements and
stipulations contained in the said several treaties, the
United States have given and granted, and by these
presents do give and grant, unto the said Cherokee
nation the two tracts of land so surveyed and herein-
before described, containing in the whole 14,374,135
acres and 14-100 of an acre, to have and to hold the
same, together with all the rights, privileges, and
appurtenances thereunto belonging, to thesaid Cher-
okee nation forever, subject, however, to the rights
of the United States to permit other tribes ot red
men to get salt on the salt plain on the western
prairie referred [to] in the seeond article of the treaty
of the 29th of December, 1835; which salt plain has
been ascertained to be within the limits prescribed for
the outlet agreed to be granted by said article, and
subject also to all the other rights reserved to the Uni-
ted States in and by the articles hereinbefore recited,
to the extent and in the manner in which the said
rights are so reserved, and subject also to the condi-
tion provided by the act of Congress of the 28th of
May, 1830, referred to m the above-recited third
article, and which condition is thfit the lands hereby
granted shall revert to the United States if the said
Cherokee nation becomes extinct or abandon the
same.
In testimony whereof, I, Martin Van Buren, Pres-
ident of the United States of America, have caused
these letters to bo made patent, and the seal of the
General Land Office to be hereunto affixed.
Given under my hand, at the city of Washington,
the 31st day of December, in the year of our
[l. s.] Lord, 1838, and of the independence of the
United States the sixty-third.

Such is the history of the title to our present
boundary of the Cherokee country (situated in
the Indian territory and lying adjacent to the
State of Kansas) as now held by that nation,
subject to no diminution from the patented
limits by any law or treaty, except so far as
the fifteenth article of the treaty of July 19,
1866, provides to hold that portion east of the
ninety-sixth degree of west longitude for joint
settlement by other civilized Indians, with
leave of the Cherokees, and by the sixteenth
article that west of ninety-six degrees for
settlement and conditional recession to the
United States for the same purposes; and the
seventeenth article of the same treaty, by
which the Cherokees recede to the United
States the eight hundred thousand acres known
as the Cherokee neutral lands, now lying
within the State of Kansas, as also that strip,
near two miles in width, taken off of the north
side of the Cherokee main grant by the cor-
rected survey of the partition line between said
Cherokee country and the State of Kansas, for
all of which the Government pays a stipulated
sum in money. The entire Cherokee limits
are now within the Indian territory, which
was set apart by the treaties of 1833 and 1885,
made under the law of May 28, 1830, and was
guarantied to them forever, and patented in
accordance with the said treaty.
lands sold to creeks.
By the treaty of Washington city, January
24, 1826, with the Creek Indians, it was pro-
vided that a deputation of five persons should
be sent by the Creek nation, at the expense
of the United States, for the purpose of select-
ing a country west of the Mississippi river that,
m the opinion of the President of the United
States, should be proportioned to their num-
bers, not within the limits of States or Terri-
tories, nor held by other Indians, for a future
and permanent home for the Creeks. The
Creek nation, in pursuance of this authority,
did send five persons as delegates to explore
the country pointed out to them by their treaty,
who selected a country west of the Territory,
now State of Arkansas, and lying between the
Verdigris, Canadian, and Arkansas rivers, to
which the Muscogee or Creek Indians were
willing to remove and settle under the guaran-
tees of the United States for a perfect title to
their new homes, under the provisions of the
law of May 28, 1830, and by the second article
of the treaty of Fort Gibson of February 14,
1883, the boundary of the Creek country west
of the Mississippi river is described as follows :
"Beginning at the mouth fork of the Canadian
river and run northwardly four mile3; thence run-
ning a straight line so as to meet a line drawn from
the south bank of the Arkansas river opposite to the
east or lower bank of Grand liver, at its junction
with the Arkansas, and which runs a course south
forty-four degrees, west one mile, to a post placed
in the ground; thence along said line to the Ark-
ansas and up the same and Verdigris river to
where the old territorial line crosses it; thence along
said linenorth to a point twenty-five miles from the
Arkansas river where the old territorial line
crosses the same; thence running a line at right
angles with the territorial line aforesaid or west to
the Mexico line; thence along the said line southerly
the Canadian river or to the boundary of the Choc-
taw country; thence down said river to the place of
beginning."
And by the third article of this treaty it is
provided that—
"The United States will grant a patent, in fee
simple, to the Creek nation of Indians, for the lands
assigned the said nation by this treaty or conven-
tion. whenever the same shall have been ratified by
the President and Senate of the United States, and
the right thus guarantied by the United States shall
be continued to said tribe of Indians so long as they
shall exist as a nation and continue to occupy the
country hereby assigned them."
It is further provided in the fourth article
of this treaty that this grant is to all the Mus-
cogee or Creek Indians, those then west of
as well as those then east of the Mississippi
river; and also for the benefit of the Seminole
Indians whose removal to that country is pro-
vided for by their treaty with the United States
dated May 9, 1832, and who have since the
date of these treaties, together with all the
Creeks who were then east of the Mississippi,
been removed to and located on said lands,
where they now reside, and where the Creeks
and Seminoles constitute parts of one nation.
patent.
Letters-patent were issued to the Creek
nation for their lands August 11, 1852, and
are now on record in the Indian office.
This boundary of the Creek country west of
the Mississippi river and their title to it from
the United States, as set forth in these treaties
and patent made under the law of May 28,
1830, remain as above stated, only so far as
the Creeks, by the third article of the treaty
of June 14, 18GG, ''in compliance with the
desire of the United States to locate other
Indians and freedmen thereon, the Creeks
hereby cede and convey to the United States,
to be sold to and used as homes for such other
civilized Indians as the United States may
choose to settle thereon, the west half of their
entire domain, to be divided by a line running
north and south ; the eastern half of said Creek
lands being retained by them shall, except as
herein otherwise stipulated, be forever pet
apart as a home for said Creek nation," &c.
And by the seventh article of the treaty of
June 14, 1866, the Creeks agree with the Uni-
ted States that the Seminole tribe of Indians
may sell to the United States their lands, which
they have since done.

The second article of the treaty of Septem
ber 27, 1830, made at Dancing Rabbit Creek,
after the passage of the act of May 28, 1830,
provided that— ,
"The United States, under a grant specially to be
made by the President of the United States, shall
caused to be conveyed to the Choctaw nation a tract
of country, west of the Mississippi river, in fee simple
