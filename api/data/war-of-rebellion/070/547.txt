Colonel MAULSBY,Martinsburg:

The measures you have taken to insure the safety of the railroad line meet the approbation of the general commanding. The railroad road company are much afraid of danger in the vicinity of Kearneysville. You will see that the men do not become careless in their duty should there be no sign of an enemy for a few days. No post returns need be made. Only the usual consolidated reports need be made.
