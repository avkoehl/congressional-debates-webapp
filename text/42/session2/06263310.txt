THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 10,
for one section in the morning he was accused
of stealing, and if he voted for another in the
evening he was convicted of it. [Laughter.]
Well, sir, I feel a sincere sympathy for that
gentleman, for I know how unpleasant these
charges of robbery are, although I have fre-
quently heard them hurled from this side_ of
the House to the other. But at the same time
I claim that I am still more miserable than
that gentleman. I appreciate the full extent
of his suffering, for 1 know how unpleasant
it is not only to be called a robber, but to
be proved one too. [Laughter.] But still I
do not think ho feels so badly as I do. For
unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, there is nothing
I can see here that I am able to steal for my
people. [Laughter.] And I assure the Chair-
man and this House that if any people rep-
resented on this floor need stealing for,'it is
those I represent.
I have seen u combination formed between
the iron men of the North and the tobacco-
raising men of the South. My people had no
part or parcel in it. I have seen the Repub-
lican woolen manufacturer of New England
combined with the Democratic Representatives
from the southern States where coal is pro-
duced ; but there was nothing there for us. I
have even seen them put salt on the tgLils of
some of our Representatives from my own
Slate, [laughter;] but that did not inure to
the benefit of my constituents.
And not only that, Mr. Chairman; not only
do wo see nothing to steal, but everybody
steals from us. It is but a tew years ago that
we had m the city of New York a magnificent
industry. You might have walked down our
wharves from the upper part of the city four
or five miles to the Battery and heard the
steady hum of commerce all along fiom one
end to the other. They were building ships,
and you heard the singing of the saw, and the
blows of (lie calking-mallet. You saw men
at work with the adze and with the plane.
You may go there now; and what is it? A
desert. All that, activity has disappeared.
Everything has been destroyed.
And yet we are taunted hy the gentleman
from Pennsylvania that we are poor, when it
is his votes that have tended to make us so,
and the voles of other gentlemen on this floor
who think like him. The gentleman tells us
that while there arc in Philadelphia only four
or five persons to a tenement, we in New
York have twelve or fourteen in our tenement
houses.
Mr. RANDALL. 1 said on an average.
Mr. 1100S15VBLT. Yes; and the gentlo-
mnn might have said that there were as many
as one hundred and fifty or two hundred per-
sons in a tenement in my district. And why
is it? Because money has been drawn from
us and gone to Pennsylvania to build'up there
a fictitious wealth.
The gentleman has taunted us that we have
all our property on the ocean, and that it is as
unstable as the element on which it rests. If
the gentleman had studied history as carefully
as he has the tariff bill, be would have found
that the wealthy and powerful nations of the
world were the commercial nations. Without
going back to olden times, look at the power
of little Venice, a little city, with no territory
to sustain it, and nothing but a shipping inter-
est to make it one of the wealthiest and most
powerful nations on the earth. Next, turn to
the free cities of the Rhine.
Look at Spain when it governed the whole
world. Look at Holland, a little place built
under the sea, you might say, dug out of the
bottom of the sea; yet carrying , the mast-
head of her admiral's ship a broom u, °.*nify
that it swept the ocean of its foes.
Gentlemen on the other side havesometimes
taunted us when we have complained wi.h the
fact that it was our Democratic friends at the
South that destroyed- our commerce, that it
was the confederate cruisers that drove our
ships from the sea and burned them in foreign
ports. I tell gentlemen that the piracies of Con-
gress have been worse for us than the piracies of
the rebels. If that had been the only cause,
no sooner had the war closed than our inter-
ests would have been revived and we would
have had to-day, as we had then, a greater
activity in ship-building than ever before. I
am informed that during the last year but two
vessels stood upon the stocks in our city where
we used to turn out hundreds. Can gentlemen
wonder, therefore, that we sometimes com-
plain, and that we are, perhaps, even a little
thankful to them when they take our coats
and leave our pantaloons ; in other words, that
we do not appreciate the fact that when they
steal but five dollars they are a little more
merciful than when they steal five and a
half?
[Mere the hammer fell.]
The CHAIRMAN. The question is upon
the amendment of the gentleman from Mis-
souri.
The amendment was withdrawn.
The question was upon the motion of Mr.
Dawes, to strike out tho line relating to pig
iron.
Mr. DAWKS. If my motion should pre-
vail to strike this clause from the bill, it would
then leave pig iron subject to a reduction of
ten per cent, of the duty. I have from the
Bureau of Statistics some figures which show
that the duty then remain.ng would be four-
teen per cent, of the foreign cost of this arti-
cle, which is a lower rate of duty than we im-
posed upon any article that I know of in this
bill.
Mr. STBYENSON. Fourteen per cent, of
the present foreign cost.
Mr. DAWES. Yes, sir. By striking out
this clause, pig iron would be left subject to a
duty of but fourteen per cent, of the foreign
cost, and I know of nothing in the tariff bill
which has so low a rate of duty.
Mr. KELLEY. I desire before the final
vote is taken to move that the duty on pig
iron shall be seven dollars per ton, and I have
some arguments to make on that proposition.
The CHAIRMAN. Such an amendment
would be now in order as the pending motion
is to strike out the clause.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. If we strike
out this clause, how do we know that we can
get anything in the bill in relation to pig iron?
Mr. DAWES. We do not want to get any-
thing more in, a3 the gentleman will see if he
« 1 read the bill. It was drawn with the ex-
pectation that the duty on iron and all man-
ufactures of iron would be reduced ten percent.\
from the present rate; that includes pig iron.
Mr. BURCHARD. Before the vote is
taken on striking out I want to say one word
in regard to a remark made by the chairman
of the Committee of Ways and Means in
reference to the rate per cent.
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is exhausted.
Mr. BURCHARD. Then, for the purpose
of making my remark, I will move to make the
duty $6 50 per ton.
The CHAIRMAN. That amendment is in
order.
Mr. BURCHARD. The gentleman from
Massachusetts again informs us as to the rate
of duty upon this article. I desire to say that
gentlemen will find in the report on commerce
and navigation, which can be. obtained from
the document-room, a percentage statement
of duty upon the different articles embraced
in this bill, calculated from the imports of the
preceding fiscal year. For the year ending
June 30, 1871, pig iron, with a duty of seven
dollars per ton, has an average protection of
forty-four per cent, upon the foreign valua-
tion. The proposed reduction to six dollar*
per ton would leave it thirty-nine per cent,
upon that valuation. The gentleman saya
that it would not be so high as that upon the
price of iron to day. That is probably true.
But it shows that this article does not need
even so much protection as this proposed rate
would give. It certainly is no reason why ws
should not reduce the duty upon iron. While
on the floor, I wish to submit, in answer to
the remarks of the gentleman from New Jer-
sey, [Mr. Hill,] the following statement:
Statement of mines or furnaces that commenced operations in the United States after 1847, taken from, the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury in J8G0-01, page 130.
