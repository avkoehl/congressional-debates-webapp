brought me back word that the rebel army was generally estimated from 30,000 to 50,000 men. I will probably know before morning the position of General Burnside.

JOHN W. WOOL,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, September 8, 1862.

THOMAS A. SCOTT, Esq.:

Your telegram respecting military operations has been referred to the General-in-Chief, for such orders as he deems proper.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., September 8, 1862.

Major-General WOOL, Baltimore:

You should not suffer troops bound for Washington to be stopped at Harrisburg. Your authority to Governor Curtin to stop regiments yesterday should be recalled. Every regiment stopped there is so much thrown away. The President desires you to see that no troops bound for Washington are stopped while the road remains open. The true defense of Harrisburg, he thinks, is to strengthen the column that is now marching on the enemy.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

BALTIMORE, September 8, 1862-6.35 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I assented to the retention of two regiments at Harrisburg, until further orders, upon the earnest appeal of the Governor, which, I frankly acknowledge, was an error. It was done when I was very much engaged, and the order has been revoked and the regiments ordered forward immediately.

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

HARRISBURG, PA.,

September 8, 1862-6.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Can you send to Carlisle to-night seven hundred carbines, slings, and ammunition, with accouterments, to equip the cavalry now there, to be used for scouting purposes in the Cumberland Valley? Competent officers will command them. The citizens will furnish horses for the purpose without purchasing them. Please answer.

A. G. CURTIN.

WASHINGTON, September 8, 1862-9 p. m.

Governor CURTIN:

Orders have been given for forwarding immediately, as soon as they can be packed, slings and ammunition referred to in your telegram,
