WARRENSBURG, May 31, 1865.

General DODGE:

There has not been a shot fired north of the Osage for three weeks; farmers are at work in peace. Two hundred guerrillas have surrendered at Lexington, and many more at other points. A story was circulated that eight men, released, were murdered by Colonel Catherwood's men. There was not a word of truth in the story; still it does us some damage.

Major General JOHN POPE:

I want that brigade of Michigan cavalry here as soon as it can be sent. If you send me any letters, send them to my office to be sent by messenger. The mail is very uncertain; takes a week sometimes to get here. I shall stay here until I get all these troops off, stores, &amp;c. They move very slow, unless there is some one to punch them up.
