Senate.
is also well known that the ancestors of the Sena-
tor's constituents, (I include the section,) brought
no small portion of the ancestors of the African, or
inferior race, ftom their native home across the
ocean, and sold them as slaves to the ancestors of
our constituents, and pocketed the price, and pro-
filed greatly by the traffic It is also known, that
when the Constitution was formed, our section felt
much jealousy lest the powers which it conferred
should re i.sed lo interfere with th" relations exist-
ing between the two races, to al a) which and in-
duce our ancestors to enter the Union, guards that
were deemed effectual against the supposed danser,
were inserted in the instrument It is also kno'vn
that the product of the labor of the inferior race has
lurnished the basis oí our widely-extended com-
merce and ample revenue, which has supported tue
Government and diffused wealth and prosperity
through the other section This is one side of the
picture     Let us now turn and look at ihe other
How has the other seclion acted1 I include not
ail, nor a majority. We have had recent prtof,
during the discussion of the íesolutions I offered at
the commencement of the session, to what great
extent jnst and patriotic feelings exist in that quar-
ter, in reference to the subject under consideration
I then narrow the question, and ask, how has the
maj-irity of the Senatoi's constituents acted, and
especially a large portion of his political support-
ers and admirers? Have they respecled the title to
our property, «bici we trace back to their ances-
tors, and which, in good fa^'h and equity, caines
wi'h it an implied warranty tint binds them to de-
fend and protect our rights to the properly so'd us?
Have they regarded iheir tailh plighted to us on
entering into the constitutional compact which
lormcd ihe Union, to ab^ta n from interfering with
oui propprtj, d"d to defend and protect us in Us
quiet enjov tnent? Have thev acted ai> those ought
who have participated so largely m the profi's de-
rived from our labor? No, they are striving, night
and day, in violation of justice, plighted faith, and
the Constitution, to divest is of oui properlj—to
reduce us to th  'evel of those whom ihey sold to
us as slaves, and to overthrow an institution on
which our safeiv depends
I come neater norm How has the Senator
him e't ict°d' He uno has such influence ard
weight with his c >i 'iijenis and «ho boasts of his
universal pitr ot -m .1 d broihe i\ love in I "ffci
ifm lor the «hole Union? Has be raised his
voice to denounce this eiying injustice, or his arm
to anest tha blow of ihe assaiiani, uh ch threatens
10 dissever the Union, and foiever -<lienaie one-
half of the community from th< othei? Has he
«tiered a word ¡n condemnation of \ loiated faith,
or honoi trampled in the dust? No he h?s sat
quietly in Ins place, withrut meting a finger or
taismg h s voic Without raising h «. vo ce, d d I

of proiec ion over the Constitution, I tit over (rie mo-
tive and character of those «hose daily avocaticn
is to de t!oy every vestige of biolheily love be-
tween these Staler, and to convert the Union into a
euise, instead of a blessing He has done more
The vvho'e Senate hasseen him retire horn his seat,
to avoid a vote on one of the resolutions that I
moved, with a view to rally the patriotic of evcy
portion 0! the community against this fell spirit,
whicn thieatens to dissolve the ¡Jaion, and turn ihe
brothel ly love and affection in which it originated
into deadly h Ue which was so obviousiy true he
could notvo'e against, but wh ch he dodged, rather
than ihrow his weight on our side, and aga n^i our
assailants. And vet, while these things are fresh
in our recollection, notorious, and known to all,
the Senator mes in his place, and proclaims aloud
that he comes 111 as the representative of the United
Stales, that, if he was born for any good, it was
for the good of Ihe whole people, and defence of
me Constitution, diat he atwavsacts as if undei ttie
eyes of the framers of the Constitution, that it
would be easier  to drive these  pillars fioin their
bases, than him from his lofty purposp, that he will
do nothing to destroy the brotherly love between
the States, and every thing Ihat the Union may
exist for ever, beneficially and thoroughly for all*
What a crmrasl between profession and perform-
ance1 What strange and extraordinary self-delu-
sim'
But this is not the only instance. There is ano-
ther in which the contrast between the coarse of the
S-nator and his lofty pretension of unbounded and
aident patriotism is not less, astonishing I reft r to
the protective tariff, and hts memorable and incon-
sistent course in relation to it
Its history may be told in a few words It rose
subsequent to the late war with Great Britain The
Senator'^ associate in this attack was its leading
supporter and author Its theor rested on the
prn c pie, that all articles which could be made in
our country should be protected, and it was an
axiom of the s)stem that its perfection consisted in
prohibiting the introduction of all such articles from
abroad. To give the restne ions on commerce ne-
cessary to effect its object a plausi&le appearance,
ihev «ere said to be for the protection of home in-
dustry, and the system itself received the imposing
name of the American System Its effects were
desolating in the <=taple States The heavy duties
imposed on their foreign exchanges left scarce'y
enough to the planter to feed and clothe his slaves,
and educate his children, while wealth and pros-
perity bloomed around the favored portion of the
Union
The Sena'or was at first opposed to the system
As fai back as the autumn of 1820, he delivered
a speech to the ctizens of Boston, in Faneuil Hall,
m opposiu in to it, in vvhich he questioned its con-
s itut o ¡alilv, and dcnoi need Us inequality and
oppression
Ills speech was followed b) a series of resolu-
tions embodying the substance of what be had
said, and which received the sanction of himself
and constituents, who, at that time, were less in-
terested m manufactures than m commerce and
navigation, which suffered m common with the
great «tapie interests of the South I ask the Se-
cretary to read the resolutions

Foal )ears after this, in April, 1824, the Senator
delivered anothei speech asainst the '\siern, 111 ie-
p \ to the then Speaker, and now h,s associate on
this occasion, in which he again denounced ihe
inequality and oppiession of the s)stem with equal
foice m one of the ablest aigaments ever delivered
on the subject, and m wh ch he completely demo-
lished the reasons ot his then opponent But an
event was then fa--t approaching, which was
destined to work a mighty and sudden revolution
m his views and feelings A few months after, ihe
Prtsidential election took place, Mr Adams was
electi d by the co-operation of ihe auihor of the
American system, and the now associate of ihe
Senator.   Those who had been enemies came to-
gether New political combinations were forrneB,
and the result wa . a close alliance between \he-
East and the West, of which that system formed
the basis. A nsw light bursted in on the Senator
A sudden thought struck him; bnt not quite as dis-
interested as that of the German sentimentalist
He made a complete summerset, heels over head,
went clear over, deserted the free trade side in a
twinkling, and joined the restrctive policy, and
then cried out that he could no longer act with me,
whom he had left standing where he had just stood,
because I was too sectional' At once every thing
the Senator had ever said or done was forgotten,
entirely expunged from the tablets of his memory.
H s whole nature was changed in an tnstani; and
thereafter no measure of protection was too strong
for his palate. With a few contortions and slight
choking, he even gulped down, a few years after,
the bill of abomination—the tariff of '28, a mea-
sure which raised the duties so high as to pass one-
half of the aggregate amount in value of the whole
imports into the public Treasury. I desire it 10 be
noted and remembered that, out of an importation
of sixty-four millions of dollars, including ev ery
description of imports, the free and dutied articles,
the Government took for its share thirty-t^o mil-
lions under the tariff of 1828, and that the Senator,
yes, he, the defender of the Constitution and eqnal
pro'ector of every section and interest, voted for
that measure, notwithstanding his recent denunci-
ation of the system as unconstitutional, unequal,
and oppressive' But he did more, and things still
more surpnsing, as the sequel will show.
The protective tariff did not change the charac-
ter of its operation with the change ot the Senator
Its oppressive and corrupting effects grew with its
growth, till the burden became intolerable under
the tariff of '28 Desolation spread itself over the
entire staple region Their commercial cities
were deserted. Charleston parted with its last
ship, and grass grew m her once busy streets The
political condition of tne c untiy presented a pros-
pect not less dreary A deep and grow ins con flic '
between the two great sections agitated the whol,
country, and a vast revenue, be)ondits most ei-
travagant wants, gave the Government, especially
the Executive branch, bound'ess patronage and
power, which were rapid!) changing ihe character
of the Government, and spreading corruptum fai
and wide through every condition of society
Something must be done, and that prompily Ev e
ry hope of reformation, or change througn this
Government, had vanished The absorbing force
of the system had drawn into its support a fixed
msjonl) m the commun t), vvhich controlled irre-
sistibly every department of the Governmeni But
one hope «'as left short of 1 evolution, and that was
in the States themselves, m their sovere gn capaci-
ty as parties to the constitutional compact For-
tunately for the country and our liiStituuon-., one
of the members of ihe Union «as frund bold
enough to interpose h?r sovereign autht my, and
declare the piolective tariff, that had caused ail this
mischief, and threatened so much more, to be un-
constitutional, and therefore, null and void, and ol
no effect within her limits, and Ihus an issue was
formed vvhich brought events to a crisis
We all remember what followed. The Go-
vernment prepared to assert by force its usurptd
powers The Proclamation «as issued, and tie
War Message and Force Bill followed, and the
State armed to maintain her censtitutional rish'-
How, now, I ask, did the Senator act in this leai-
ful cusís, he tv ho had, but a short time be orp,
pronounced the system tobe nncouMttutumil, unt
qual. unjust, and oppressive? Tid he feel any
sv mpathy ¡or those w ho felt and thought .as he did
bul a briel period before- Did he make any ali««
anee ioi their falling into the same errois (if >uch
he then considered them) nVo which he hiroseithad
fallen? Did he show that ardent devotion to pu-
serve the bromerlv love between ihe uaembeis of
the Unicn ha now so boastingly ^rolesses?. Dn'
he, who calls himself the defender ot the Const.tu
lien, feel any compunction in lesoiting 10 force, to
evecuie laws wh'ch he had pionoumed 10 b in
violation ot the Constitution? Did e, itUiu¡,¡-
fested such deep distrust of those 111 pouei, «,)■>
had been foremost in proclaiming thut   usujpa-
