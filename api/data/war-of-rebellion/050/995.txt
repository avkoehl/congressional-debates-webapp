Question. How large a force of organized men do you think you saw anywhere on the road as you went to Rossville?

Answer. I saw, probably a mile and a half from the battle-field, some men drawn across the road; the officer in command I did not know. Colonel Ducat was there, and I supposed they had been rallied by him I assisted him a long time there in rallying and stationing them, to prevent our men from falling back, or to resist an attack of the enemy. There may have been there some 500 men. It is difficult for me to recollect now. I know that I would rather have had a good regiment than those I saw there.
