have stoves for each tent and I recommend that they be furnsihed as soon as practicable. Generally they are sufficiently supplied with clothing, but there are some cases where a garment or two is needed, and these are being supplied as fast as possible. Provisions of good quality, except beans, are furnsihed in a superabundance. No great-coats are issued except to thesis, because there are not enough for all, and as yet there has been no special necessity for them. An issue will be made as soon as they are obtained. The sick are in tents, not as comfortably provided for as they should be. Their great want is stoves and these have been estimated for. They require also king treatment, which in my judgment the surgeon-in-charge does not appreciate, ad I respectfully recommend that a medical officer peculiarly fitted for such a position be ordered there. The police of the camp is generally good inside, but there is room for improvement; much of the ground outside is used by the men for the demands of nature, which can only be prevented by the erection of suitable sinks, which I will order immediately. The troops in this camp have nothing to complain of except so far as the hospital is concerned, which they can remedy by a little industry on their own part. The condition of the paroled men would be much better if it were not for the absence or inefficiency of their officers, and there would be a better state of discipline but for their bad examples and promptings. Many officers and men are absent from the camp without authority, and I respectfully ask how they are to be treated. There area great many paroled officers and men scattered through the different States, absent from their regiments without authority, and it is a matter of much consequence to the service that it should be determined whether they are to be treated as deserters or whether the absence is to be operated at the pleasure of the absentees. The guard consists of a detachment of about 300 men, six companies, detailed from the troops in Annapolis, but the number is quite insufficient, and as they are at the camp only temporarily the duty is not done as thoroughly nor as efficiently as it should be, and I recommend that a guard of 500 men be detailed to be permanently at the camp, forming a part of the command. I propose to give instructions immediately which will improve the condition of things at the camp in every particular. As a first necessity an efficient guard is absolutely required, and I respectfully request that General Wool be instructed to order the detail.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., November 7, 1862.

Major PETER ZINN, Commanding Camp Chase, Columbus, Ohio.

MAJOR: Your letter of the 1st is received. My instructions of the 22nd ultimo referred only to prisoners of war belonging to the Confederate Army-such as are held for exchange. This does not of course embrace guerrillas and other irregular organizations. You were right in not releasing the men you refer to, and they will be held for exchange if they are recognized by the rebel authorities as belonging to their army.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
