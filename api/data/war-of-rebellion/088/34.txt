Major-General BUTLER:

Deserters from Twenty-fifth South Carolina told us yesterday that Kershaw's division had gone south the day before. Do you hear anything of it, or can you tell us anything about Field's division? We think we can account for all the other divisions. Have not heard of Pickett's division since Saturday p. m., but suppose it is in its old place on part of your front. Please answer at headquarters Army of the Potomac to-day.

A deserter from the Twenty-fifth South Carolina informs us that the rumor is that Kershaw's division went south on Monday night. Another deserter from the Forty-second North Carolina, Hoke's division, says that Kershaw's division was on his right but that it was rumored it had gone south, and that on the night the rumor was heard trains were moving all night south. Field's division is in our front at Deep Bottom. We have both prisoners and deserters from it. Men from Pickett's division come in daily from our front. We have heard of no special movements there.
