AUGUSTA, GA., February 3, 1865.

His Excellency President Davis,

RICHMOND, Va.:

The fall of Charleston and Columbia would necessitate soon abanodonment of Wilmington and East North Carolina. If troops from there and from Virginia could be sent me at Columbia, with their transportation, I would defeat, and might destroy, Sherman's army. No time, however, should be lost.

Cheatham's and Stewart's corps had not arrived. The head of Cheatham's corps was expected to arrive on the 4th or 5th, and the head of Stewart's on the 10th or 11th instant. In view of Sherman's present position, his manifest advance toward Branchville from Pocotaligo and Coosawhatchie, the weaknees of our forces, and the expocted arrival of the re-enforcements above referred to, it was deemed inadvisable to concentrate our foces at Branchville, and there offer battle
