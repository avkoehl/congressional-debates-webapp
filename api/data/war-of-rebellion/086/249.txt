General REYNOLDS,

Commanding, Mouth of White River:

Yours of 22nd just received. I will have your largest brigade off before 12 m. The other one is up the river at Paducah, sent upon the receipt of a dispatch from General Halleck. I expect it down by to-morrow, and will send it to you forthwith. Forrest's force, I think, is about leaving, or has left, Corinth and Jackson for a raid into Kentucky, or, via Tuscumbia, to Sherman's communications.

Your obedient servant,

M. L. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
