The quota assigned is obtained as follows:

Gross quota................................11,275

Excess deducted........................... 6,896

________

Quota to be divided by 3..................3)4,379

________

Actual number required.................... 1,459

Now, if these 1,459 men had been furnished in advance of the call, the excess would be just so much larger, and the same operation would then be performed.

Gross quota.............................. 11,275

New excess deducted..................... 8,355

_______

Quota to be divided by 3................ 3)2,920

_______

Actual number still required........... 973

I also suggested that if the call had been considered as for 800,000 men, and the quotas assigned, as on all previous calls, in proportion to the enrollment, the 300,000 men actually required would be obtained, as the total excess of credits is but 500,000; yet the burden would fall upon the deficient districts, and the excess of Rhode Island would be found sufficient to satisfy the call, as our quota would be 6,698, while our admitted excess is 6,896. The legality of making the call on this plan, and that it would fulfill all requirements of the President's proclamation, was admitted at the department; but deeming the system pursued to be equally just and legal, it was adopted, though the incorrectness of such a conclusion, it is thought, is shown in the two statements above given, which were left in the department for the consideration of a board which I was informed had been instituted for the purpose of investigating the system adopted by the Provost-Marshal-General in assigning quotas under the present call. The report of this Board cannot, it is thought the decision on which Rhode Island is required to furnish more men on that call, and will, it is hoped, result in the withdrawal of the quota assigned.

Upon other matters which you instructed me to bring to the notice of the department I respectfully report-upon the requisite formalities being complied with the action requested by Your Excellency will undoubtedly be promptly taken.

With great respect, Governor, I have the honor to be, Your Excellency's obedient servant,

CHARLES E. BAILEY,

Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
