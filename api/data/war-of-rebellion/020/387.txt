tunately run aground and knocked a hole in her bottom, is in the river, and cannot be removed until thoroughly repaired. The guns, carriages, ammunition, &amp;c., are now on board the transport Neptune and will be forwarded to Hilton Head forthwith. The batteries and works on Saint John's Bluff are completely destroyed, and, as I have since found it impracticable to remove the corn on the banks of Saint John's River, the object of the expedition has been attained sooner than I had anticipated when writing my last communication.

I have sent an expedition up the river for the purpose of destroying some rebel steamboats said to be concealed some miles from this. It is expected back early to-morrow, October 8, when I shall be ready to return, and merely awaiting the Boston.

Many refugees, with their families, and about 100 contraband have placed themselves under my protection, and it is intention to bring them to Hilton Head on my return.

Since my last communication I have discovered another battery, not yet mounted but ready for the reception of guns. This the gunboats will destroy before leaving the river.

I am deeply indebted to Captain Steedman, U. S. Navy, commanding the gunboats in this river, for his prompt offer of assistance to relieve the transport Cosmopolitan and for his hearty co-operation during the entire expedition.

I have the honor to be, general, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. BRANNAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
