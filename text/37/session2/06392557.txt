THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOJBE.
โข-2S6SP
tween the two, except this: the Senator from
Maine says that the marine insurance of this coun-
try is bro.ught into very active competition with
the continental and English security companies,
iff understand him correctly, i have this to say:
that the duty on marine insurance companies in
England is just as great as it is on fire insurance,
so far as I can judge from the tables. We have
not the laws before us, but so far as I can judge,
there is no difference made there, and 1 see no
reason why the business of insuring ships should
not pay the same duty precisely as the business
of insurance against losses by fire. There is no
reason for the distinction.
It seems to me that the whole of this trouble is
made by large corporations, who do this business
in large sums. I believe if this insurance busi-
ness was divided up as the manufacturing busi-
ness is, into small establishments, we should hear
no complaints; but these large insurance estab-
lishments can send their agents and committees
here for the purpose of creating public opinion,
and making a large show of loss, or damage, or
injury, and they are the persons who can influ-
ence a tax. When the subject of insurance was
first spoken of, we all agreed that the tax pro-
vided for in the House bill was not correct; first,
because it was too high on fire insurance; and
next, because there was a distinction made be-
tween fire and marine insurance. The House
proposition was, therefore, abandoned, and this
one substituted.
When it was proposed to fix a percentage upon
the receipts of insurance companies, it was pro-
posed that the same rule which was applied to
manufacturing establishments, should be applied
to them. And why? One argument made to me
was, that the total receipts of an insurance com-
pany were about equal to the capital stock; the
total annual receipts, or the* total annual produc-
tions, of a manufacturing company, are about
equivaientto the capital stock; consequently atax
of three per cent, on manufactures is equivalent
to a tax of three per cent, on insurance, and vice
versa, f do not know any reason why a lower
rate of tax should be put on the insurance com-
pany than on the manufacturing company, be-
cause the tax is collected from the consumer of
the article, if it be a manufacture, or from the
insured.
It seems to me, therefore, that, to make a dis-
crimination between the two classes of insurance,
would be only to carry out the evil of the House
proposition; and, in my judgment, to put the rate
of tax on insurance lower than the rate on man-
ufactures, would certainly be clearly unjust. The
amount that may be received from this source is
very large; it will be collected in very small sums;
and it will not be seriously felt. I have no doubt
these insurance companies will, in all eases,charge
it over to the insured; it will be paid by those en-
gaged in commercial pursuits; by those most able
to bear it; and it will not be hard on any one. ff
the amount insured, for instance, is $5,000, and
the insurance is thirty dollars, the tax is only
ninety cents. It is a very small tax which will
yield a large sum of money to the Government,
and will not be oppressive to any one. I hope,
theiefore, the amendment reported by the Com-
mittee on Finance will be adhered to, or, if the
rate is too high, it had better be lowered all round
rather than on marine insurance alone.
Mr. HALE. I want to ask the chairman
whether there is any distinction made between
stock companies and insurance companies in the
tax bill?
Mr. FESSENDEN. Insurance companies are
stock companies.
Mr. HALE. I mean between mutual insurance
companies and stock companies.
Mr. FESSENDEN. No, sir; but the Senator
from Vermont [Mr. Collamer] has prepared an
amendment.
Mr. FOOT. I am going to offer it in a moment.
Mr. HALE. 1 will say what I was going to
say on (he bill as it is. it strikes me, if there is
to be any discrimination made, the premium on
mutual insurance companies should be lower than
it is on marine insurance companies. As the bill
now stands, and as the Senate have voted it to
stand, you tax mu-tual insurance companies not.
according to profits, but according to misfortunes;
the more they lose, the higher the tax. For in-
stance: here is a mutual insurance company which
takes a stock note we will say for sixty or one
hundred dollars on a piece of property. It meets
with a loss; and because they have met with a
loss they are obliged to call in fifteen, twenty, or
fifty per cent, of their premium notes to meet their
loss; and upon that loss you tax them three per
cent. That is the way the bill stands now, and
the way the Senate have voted to keep it in. If
there is any discrimination made, it seems to me
that the marine insurance companies should pay
higher than the mutual fire insurance companies;
and if there is to be any discrimination made, it
should be made not in favor of the marine insur-
ance, but in favor of the mutual insurance com-
panies.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The question
is on the amendment offered by the Senator from
Maine.
The amendment was not agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question now
returns on concurring in the amendment made
as in Committee of the Whole.
Mr. FOO T. 1 offer the following as a proviso
to the pending amendment. It was prepared by
my colleague, and is in pursuance of the views
he expressed before he was obliged to leave the
Chamber. I suppose there will be no objection
to it. It is to add:
Provided, That nothing in this act shall be construed to
extend to mutual fire msuiance companies, whose busi-
ness is confined to the insurance of the property of its
members, and have no capital nut the premium notes of
its members, and neither collects nor has nor is to have
any piofits.
Mr. SHERMAN. I regret very much that I
did not hear the remarks of the honorable Sen-
ator from Vermont, [Mr. Collamer;] but that
whole subject was thoroughly considered. There
is no reason in the world why a man who takes
his chance in amutual insurance company should
not pay the same tax. In Ohio nearly all our
insurance is done by mutual insurance companies,
in which, instead of paying a premium, we pay
assessments. I am myself insured m one of these
mutual insurance companies, and pay by assess-
ments every year; that is my share of the losses.
I may just as well, and with just as much pro-
priety add an assessment of three per cent, to this
loss, as that a company should pay three percent,
on the amount they receive. There is no good
reason for the distinction. These mutual insur-
ance companies are brought in contact and com-
petition with capital companies; sometimes one
has the advantage, and sometimes the other, in
particular neighborhoods. I think a discrimin-
ation ought not to be made between them.
The VICE PRESIDENT put the question,
and declared that the yeas appeared to have^t.
Mr. POWELL. I cali for a division.
Mr. FESSENDEN. We shall be obliged to
have the yeas and nays. We cannot get a quo-
rum otherwise.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. TRUMBULL. It seems to me that pro-
viso is manifestly right. I cannot understand the
propriety of taxing a company that has no stock.
These mutual insurance companies have no cap-
ital. They make an assessment annually to col-
lect the amount of losses which the company has
sustained; and if you tax them, you would only
add so much to the assessment of the men who
insure in the company. It seems to me there is
no propriety m the world in imposing that tax.
I think the proviso ought to be adopted.
Mr. FOOT. As the Senator from Illinois has
said, these companies have no stock, and of course
no profits, and are not based on that idea. They
merely lay assessments from year to year suffi-
cient to cover the losses of the members.
Mr. DAVIS. I once had a little experience in
a mutual insurance company. I had first insured
in a Hartford company, which failed; and I got
tired of that kind of a company, and I thought I
would join a mutual insurance company in the
State of Kentucky. I gave my stock note for five
or six hundred dollars, i do not recollect which;
and during the first fifteen months, though I had
suffered no loss from fiie, I was called upon and
assessed for the payment of ยง800. That satisfied
me in n-lation to a mutual insurance company,
and I nevei had anything to do with one since.
[Laughter.] I went back to the present Hartford
company, and am insured in that now, and it has
paid up pretty well. But I think it is all moon-
shine to charge three: percent, on mutual insur-
ance companies. .. - ,
Mr. HALE. The experience of the,Senator
has been altogetherdifferentfrom what i^hasbeen
elsewhere. I have had the housejn^whi&itl live
insured in one of those companies for aboutj^OOiO
for more than twenty years, and I ne*er had t&a
half of $180 to pay the whole time. - *
Mr. DAVIS. You had more honest officers
than we had in oar company.
Mr. SHERMAN. This is a much more serious
matter than seems to be supposed.; and,gentlernen
interested in insurance will find it so. Fully one
half the insurance companies established and fully
one half the amount insured is in matual insur-
ance companies. They have capital stock. Their
premium notes are their capital stock, made so by
their charter. They are liable for assessment. In-
stead of paying it over to an incorporated com-
pany, in the mode that other companies collect,
paying it in advance, they collect it by assessments
for each loss. The property is insured in the
same way. The premium notes form the capital
of the company. If you give to these mutual
insurance companies the advantage of three, per
cent., it would be a very onerous burden upon the
other insurance companies. It is a matter about
which the Senator from Connecticut might very-
well complain. I do not wish to do that class of
companies injustice; butifyou make thisdiscrira-
ination in favor of the mutual insurance compa-
nies, everybody will go into the mutual insurance
companies, and evade the tax, and all these com-
panies will be turned into mutual insurance com-
panies.
I can tell the Senator from Illinois another thing.
They have capital stock; they have property;
many of them have accumulated assets.. Their
premium notes are their capital stock. They
sometimes collect ten per cent, on the premium
notes in order to have an accumulated capital.
They have property just like any other insurance
company; and it will operate very unjustly if you
do not levy the same tax on them as on other com-
panies. Indeed, you cannot discriminate in favor
of one company as against another. The only dif-
ference between a mutual and a stock company
is this: in fautual companies the persons who are
insured own the whole of the stock, are the stock-
holders, and divide the profits among themselves
instead of dividing them out to stockholders, and
take the risk. In the one case capitalists combine
together and invest, their capital, risk their cap-
ital to save losses by fire; in the other case they
risk their notes, or the assessment upon their
notes. There is no difference in principle between
them, and both ought to be taxed.
Mi. TRUMBULL. I do not so understand
mutual insurance companies. I understand that
these premium notes are merely given as security
for losses. There are no profits that are divided
anywhere. Such a thing as a division of profits
in a mutual insurance company is unheard of.
They take these notes as a security upon which
they make an assessment of the losses. Usually,
I believe, these assessments are made annually.
At the end of the year it is ascertained what the
amount of loss has been, and then they make an
assessment upon the members of the company,
whose notes they have, sufficient to meet the losses.
If the loss is ten per cent., they collect ten per
cent, on the notes; they never divide any profit to
anybody, there is nota dollar paid to anybody in
the world as profit. Their officers are employed
at stated salaries to manage the concern; but there
is never any distribution of profits whatever. How-
is it with stock companies? A stock company is
formed for the purpose of making money for the
stockholders; that is the object. They make in-
surance upon such terms as to make money out
of them; and I think some of the Hartford com-
panies have made millions in that way; but there
is no money made by a mutual insurance com-
pany; and the whole effect of a tax upon a mutual
insurance company is to require them, when the
assessment is made, to assess the amount of your
tax upon the peisons who have insured. What
propriety in the woild is therein doing that? Ifl
have insured <j5,000 worth of property in n mutual
insurance company, am I to pay an additional
tax because I have done it? It is not a tax upon
stockholders who are making money outof it. It
will amount exactly to this: when the board of
officers at the end of the year come to make the
