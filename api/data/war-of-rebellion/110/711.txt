WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., July 21, 1864.

Governor J. W. BROWN,

Atlanta, Ga.:

Your telegram of the 19th, received by President and referred to me, excites surprise. Your late proclamation recognizes the necessity of details in larger measures, it is believed, than is allowed by Confederate law. The several companies for local defense referred to by you are organizations under special law and cannot be called for service beyond the terms of their enlistment. They are believed to be essential for the guard of the important points where they now exist. Detailed men are in the military service of the Confederate States and cannot be enforced to militia duty. Under exigency these details may be suspended or revoked and they called to duty with the reserves forces. General Cobb as commander of reserves is instructed and had discretion in this matter. Disclosure of the views or military plans of the Department is not deemed expedient. While your judgment of its means or the modes of applying them cannot be allowed to control, the best judgment of the Department will be exercised so to employ the military resources of the Confederacy as to defend to the utmost of its ability Georgia as well as the other States.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
