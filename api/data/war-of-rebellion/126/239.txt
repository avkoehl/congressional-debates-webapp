war, so far as ascertained from

reports analyzed in this office.

But vast quantities of forage were purchased and issued at remote or subordinate posts, the accounts of which cannot be made up without a complete analysis of the vouchers of disbursing officers. Much was purchased or taken on the march by officers subsequently killed or disabled, or by officers not reporting to this department. For much of this memorandum receipts were given; and these are amount the claims continually reaching this office under

the law of July 4, 1864.

The total quantity of fuel reported as furnished is-

CLAIMS FOR REGULAR SUPPLIES.

To the Fifth Division is intrusted the examination of claims for fuel, forage, and other regular supplies, irregularly taken by the armies, and not accounted for or imperfectly reported by officers of this department. Such of these as appear to be just and equitable are referred to the Third Auditor of the Treasury, with a recommendation for settlement, under the law of July 4, 1864.

A copy of General Orders, Numbers 35, which contains the rules for examination of these claims accompanies this report.

These claims are examined as to the actual use of the supplies by the Army, as to the past and present loyalty of the claimants and witnesses, and as to the genuineness of the signatures. Information as to loyalty is south from provost-marshals; and a very large number of claims is reject upon evidence of disloyalty of both claimants and witnesses.

There have been received and referred to the Fifth Division, from January 1 to October 16, 1865, 4,245 packages, containing 14,455 claims, vouchers given by officers of the Quartermaster's Department, and presented under the act of July 4, 1864, and General Orders, Numbers 35.
