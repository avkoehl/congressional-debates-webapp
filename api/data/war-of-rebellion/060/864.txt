Respectfully forwarded to Major-General Sigel for the information within asked for.

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.

[Second indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Cumberland, Md., April 14, 1864.

Respectfully returned to Major-General Stahel, with information that it was originally intended to send Captain Ewing's battery, westward, but this has been changed so as to allow Captain Keeper's battery to accompany the expedition, especially as he is fully equipped. Captain Ewing's battery will therefore remain for the present in the eastern end of the department.

By order of Major-General Sigel:

T. MELVIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 14, 1864-2. 25 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Annapolis, Md.:

I find the great majority of troops being drawn from the Northern States, by the system of inspection established, ar men who belong to different regiments already in the field. The number therefore to be attached to your corps will be less than I calculated.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
