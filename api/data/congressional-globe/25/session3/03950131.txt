and Disbursement of the Revenue—Mr. Hunter.                            Ho. of Reps.

hend the public lands withm the system which
they piopo^e Perhaps it is as well, for several
reasons, that they should not be included at pres-
ent In the first place, difficulties might arise in
the commencement of a system so novel, which
would be easily overcome by the available cash
funds afforded from the publiclands This would,
at least, be highly useful until the system became
familial in practice Again, the public mind is
jubt now so unsettled in relation to the mode of
disposing of these lands, that changes might occur,
in íelation to them, which would take them with-
out the operation of the system, if it were now
adapted to them Should the present mode of
disposing of these lands fiom the General Govern-
ment to the individual purchaser be retained, it
would not only be practicable, but expedient, hei e-
after to include them withm the proposed system
The only practical difficulty in the case would be
as to the means of enforcing punctual payment of
the bonds given for them when they weie due It
is believed that this might be accomplished by
making the receipts semi-annual instead of quar-
terly, and by the provisions hereafter suggested
for enforcing the punctual payment of these bonds
when due, whethei given by the highest bidder at
the auctions, or by the purchaser on private entry.
This might be secured by providing, first, that so
much money should be paid at the execution of
Ihe bond as would secure the probable fulfillment
of the contract, secondly, that the obligees who
failed to pay these bonds when due, should be re-
fused credit theieafter at the land offices, thirdly,
that neither patent noi possession should be given
until the payment of the money at the receiptday,
when it was due, and, fourthly, upon such fail-
uie at the proper day, that any other person might
take the patent for the lands upon paying down
immediately the sum due upon the bond
As it is not proposed to include the public lands
just now within the operation of the system, it
will be needless to enlarge upon the provisions
just sketched in relation to them.
Having leviewed the practical operation of this
system, it may be well to examine, for a moment,
its political and incidental effects, one of which
undoubtedly will be an entire separation of the
banks and the General Government The sepaia-
tion must be complete, inasmuch as the Govern-
ment will no longer have the means of rewarding
or punishing the banks through the use of its
funds and ci edit, whilst the banks will lose the
power of impeding the fiscal operations of the Gov-
ernment when these are conducted without their
agency The General Government will then be
entirely responsible for the success of it  fiscal
administration, and the banks will be subject to
no power but that of the States which created
them So long as these aie dependent upon each
other in interest, they must either sympathize in
action, or a fierce war between the two will be
inevitable, and in this the people must be the suf-
ferers. The banks, on the one hand, being armed
with the power of expanding and contracting the
currency, and the General Government, on the
other, either attacking their credit with the people,
upon which their existence depends, or arraying
one set of banks against the other, through the use
of its turds, that it may conquer by their divisions,
the consequence would be, either that the Govern-
ment would acquire the power of the banks, or the
banks would obtain that of the Government, and
the people would be the sufferers in this contest
for powers which ought not to be united in either
To arm the General Government with the power
of the banks would be to destroy the balances of
the Constitution, whilst the reverse of this opera-
tion would not be tolerated after it was understood
The only possible mode of preventing the union
of these powers is to separate them in action and
interest—an event so much to be desired that it
ought to be effected even at a pecuniary loss to the
people, if that were necessary. But, m point of
fact, this is not the pose, and the separation now
proposfd is relieved from the objections, whether
founded or unfounded, which were ra.sed against
the other modes heretofore suggested foi accom-
plishing this puipose.
In thefiist flare, this system does not hoard up
large ar.ounts of capital in specie, to lie idle m
the hands of the Government; on the contrary, it
leaves the public funds which are not wanted for
lmmediatedisbursementin thehandsof the debtors,
the Government, and not the banks, deuvmg the
interest upon their use.
Secondly It does not afford the public officers
the means of using these funds for private pur-
poses, inasmuch as very little money passes
through their hands, and then only for immediate
disbuisement
Thirdly Itdoesnotproducean inconvenient run
upon the banks for specie, in the payment of pub-
he dues Por so large a proportion of the collec-
tions and disbursements will be accomplished by
a meie exchange of credit, and the residue to be
recen ed in specie will be too small to be felt by
the merchants or banks
And, fomthly It does not permit the use of
Treasury drafts as currency, as the existing laws
have been supposed to justify, because it places
such conditions upon these drafts as effectually
prevent the conversion of Government credit into
currency, and limits its uses to the mere purposes
of exchange. It merely introduces machineiy to
facilitate the exercise of the undoubted right of
an individual to set off his claim upon the Gov-
ernment against a claim of the Government upon
him; the right of the Treasury to draw upon its
funds being more limited under the system pro-
posed, than at present with the existing laws As
it is this feature which abstracts the Government
as a disturber of the currency, and enables it to
administer its revenue without injury to the banks,
and unaffected by their conduct, it may be well to
examine its operation a little more closely
The pecumai y transactions of society are settled
either in currency, or by an exchange of credit
Those upon short notice and of small amount are
usually settled in the former mode, whilst heavy
transactions, distant either in point of time or
space, are most commonly set against each other
To the extent to which this exchange of credit is
effected, the demand for currency diminishes in a
given amount of business Indeed, the extent of
this species of exchange may almost be considered
as a measure of the improvement in commercial
communities It is a geneial truth, to which, of
course, there are exceptions, that the individuals
of a society sell as much as they buy. Whenever
there is a debt due from an individual, it may
safely be assumed that another of equal amount
is somewhere due to him. To collect and array
these against each other, is a most important
branch of trade. The facility for doing this will
increase as the channels of trade wear deeper from
use, and the course of its current can be calculated
with more certainty It is manifest thatthelimita
are wide between which this process may fluctu-
ate, and that the more it is extended the better
for trade, inasmuch as it will then require less cur
rency which is expensive, and in that very cir-
cumstance dimmish the dangers of a change in the
standard of value. If these things be true, it is
clear that the same amount of trade in different
states or conditions may require different propor-
tions of currency. A community dealing in money
only, (if that could be,) would lequire much moie
currency for its trade than would be necessary for
the same trade in another which dealt m exchanges
as well as m currency.
if the Government, therefore, were to deal only
in money, the currency would ebb and flow with
the tide of revenue, whilst, if it were practicable,
that it dealt only by an offset of its liabilities, the
variations of currency and revenue would be in-
dependent of each other. The effect of the former
system would be, that the Government, through
its revenue, would affect the currency by one law,
whilst the operations of tiade would influence it
by another, and thus fluctuations in the revenue
might often afford a serious disturbance to cur-
rency and commerce There can be no doubt but
that the amount of currency in any coun'ry ought
to be regulated by its trade, and this can never be
entirely effected, unless the demands of Govern-
ment for currency either sympathize exactly with
those of trade, or else cease altogether- the first it
is impossible to effect, but the latter may be ac-
complished, to a very great extent, byan exchange
of credit The very circumstances which increase
its disturbing effects, when dealing in currency, fit
it for the latter operation. Its credit is good, its
transactions are heavy, and may be arranged on
time, from the distance between the places of re-
ceipt and disbursement    These are the favoring
circumstances which have induced the belief that
the provisions of the bill now reported will accom-
plish the end proposed.    If this be so, it may be
asked if the banks themselves are not interested m
I the adoption of such a measure    The loss of a
valuable customer in the Government is undoubt-
edly something; but with the entire field of Ameri-
can trade between them, they have ample room
| for adventure, and the loss of the Government as
a customer is not an evil to be compared with the
dangers to which they would be subjected in the
i rude conflicts of party, so long as they maintained
a political connection. Nor is this the only advant-
age which they would derive.    Their operations
[ would be safer, when their currency was no longer
i forced to ebb and flow with  the Government ex-
1 penditures. They have themselves attributed some
' of their disasters to this cause, and doubtless there
j have been periods when this connection was mu-
' tually embarrassing to both parties
I     Having suggested the considerations which may
i commend the system mow proposed to the atten-
tion of Congress, this report ought here, perhaps,
to be closed.    But theie are other circumstances
which impress it upon our attention, to which we
beg leave for a moment to refer     It is not neces-
sary to commend this plan to the consideration of
Congress, that it should be the best in the abstract;
it is enough to show that it is better than that now
, in operation, provided it contains nothing posi-
(itively ill in itself.   To say that it would be better
I than the present system, (if system it can be
called,) would be to raise no extravagant preten-
sion in its favor.    The fragments of laws which
now operate upon the subject can scarcely be said
to afford a umfoim rule, or to impose any limits
upon the discretion of the Secretary     It is so
difficult  to  reduce  the  remains  of the  various
systems which have been wrecked, oi partially
repealed, into anything like order or uniformity,
I that it would be almost impracticable to hold the
Secretary responsible, if we were to adopt his dis-
cretion  as   the only guide    There are various
constructions of the laws now in force, by skillful
combinations of which he might introduce any
system he pleased, with at least some plausibility
of pretext     If it be true, as some have supposed,
that the joint resolution of 1816, as modified by
subsequent legislation, leaves it in the discretion
of the Secretary of the Treasury, to receive nothing
but specie, or nothing but convertible paper, as he
may please; and that the act of 23d June, 1836,
is virtually repealed, from the disqualification of
the banks which  suspended  specie payment to
accept  the  conditions of the act, then  he may
introduce the Independent Treasury at his own
pleasure, and that, too, without any of the restric-
tions which the fi lends even of that measure wished
to impose upon him     On the other hand, if the
l despotic act is to be considered as functus officio,
I whilst that of 1789 is still in force, he may adopt
| the State bank agency v/ithoutany of those checks
I by which the friends of that system would limit
1 his authority, before they would intrust him with
the powei ot using them    And, lastly, supposing
the act of 23d June, 1836, to be still in force, so
soon as  banks aiise which are not disqualified
from acting under it hy its provisions, then it is
manifest that, during the progress of their creation,
we have a system mixed of bank and individual
agency, without any sensible limitation upon the
discretion of the Secretary who administers it.
Nor is this all. the law of 23d June, 1836, will
then operate as a premium to the erection of new
banks, which alone can enjoy its benefits under
such a construction of its provisions     The effect
of this bounty would probably be to call new
banks into existence, and when enough of these
had arisen to fulfill the piovisions of the law, we
should have the very system which has already
failed upon our hands.    In giving these various
constructions of the acts regulating the Treasury
Department, we express no opinion of our own
in relation to them.   It is not necessary to do so.
We state the various opinions upon this subject,
to indicate the dangerous latitude of the discretion
now left in the Secretary of the Treasury.   And
yet, notwithstanding this immense discretion re-
posed m the Secretary of the Treasury, it is still
almost impossible for him to administer the De-
partment with convenience to himself and safety
