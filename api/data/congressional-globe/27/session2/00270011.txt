's penditurc-s under the coiitingent fund of the office
5 of the Secretary of the jSiavy and the office o£ the
¥ Navy Coeimissionere.
g-      Mr. KING of Georgia moved to refer it to the
1.  Committee on Naval Affairs.
       Mr. CAVE JOHNSON desired to know whether
1   the Committee on Naval Affairs had yet been ap-
;? pointed.   It was not usual to refet matters to the
fe  standing committees before their appointment.
j :      Mr. WISE moved to lay the document on  the
S   table, and that it be printed.   This, he'said,  was
%  the Usual course taken with regard to Executive
1   communica.iop.5 before the announcement of the
(*,  standing committees.
I       This motion was agreed !o.
f       Mr. HOPKINS proposed to take op and concur
|   with the resolution sent from ihe Senate, providing
|   for ihe appointment of Chaplains.
I       The SPEAKER informed the gentleman that ihe
I   House had already passed a joint resolution on that
I'  subject.
k       Mr. BRIGGS supposed that nothing remained to
*c   do bat to so at cnce into ihe eleciion.
t      Mr. RHEi'T nominated the Rev. Dr. Benjamin
I   Palmer.
I The SPEAKER said that Ihe first business in
I ordfr was ihe reception of petitions.
I _ Mr. CAVE JOHNSON inquired if the first bu-
i siness in order was not the report of ihe Committee
t ject had been made tue spec ai order for yesterday,
I en the Rules and Orders of th-' House. That sub-
| (Thursday,) and for every succeeding day till dis-
| posed of, He should think that this report was ths
(    first bu^itie-s in rrdcr
Í Mr. JOHNSON of Mar>land said lhat as many
j gentlemen weie anxious to proceed with other
r business, he would rr.o,e the postponement of the
i    fpecial oraer.
| The SPEAKER ask-'d the gentleman if his mo-
f ticn contera plated a fixed day to postpone the spe-
j    cial order to.
i       Several gentlemen named Monday next.
s        Mr. JOHNSON of Maryiand said that he should
I    not fix on any day.    If the  postponement shouid
Í   be carried, the Hoase could take the report up any
t    day it pleaded.
j Mr. WILLIAMS of North Carolina moved to
• amend the gentleman's motion so as to postpone
t   the order to Mo;>d-.y next.
Mr. JOHNSON ot Marylan-1 then said that he
! should vary his motion so as to move to lay the re-
; port oa the table. T/ie House could then take it
'    up when it pleased.
Mr. FILLMORE asked, if the report was laid
,   on the '.able, i; ¡t would na require a vete of two-
thirds to take it tp again.

I Mr. FILMORE rose for the purpose of inquiring
1 whether the President's message did not properly
i come up the fitst thing in order. If it did. he
: would again submit the resolutions he offered yes-
1    terday.
Mr. ATHERTON objected to the reception of
the resolutions.
Mr. JOHNSON of Tennessee desired to inquire
of the Chair whether any business could be in or-
der till the announcement of the standing com-
miiieef? As petifons could not be referred till
then, he thought the message could not either be
:l referred.
i i The SPEAKER thought it was in the power of
|| the House to take tip and refer the message.
; Mr. JOHNSON of Tenne^ee, with a view to
1 the organization of the Houst-, -nd to give the
! Speaker 'irne to apr-oim the coramit'ees, moved an
;    adjournment till MiT.-in ..
I The SPEAKER liuurmed the fentieman that
■ he could not make the compound motion to ad-
| journ. and to adjourn over to Monday; he could
! accomplish his object by first moving for the
j House to adjourn over to the day he fixed on, and
i that motion prevailing, then moving for an adjourn-
ment.
Mr. JOHNSON of Tennessee accordingly
moved that when the Hous« adjourn, it adjourn
over to Monday next; which motion was carried
without a division.
Mr. JOHNSON of Tennessee then moved that
the House do adjourn.
Mr. FILLMORE called for the yeas and nays
on the motion.
Mr. JOHNSON of Tennessee, to save the time
of the House, withdrew his motion.
Mr. FILLMORE then moved to take up the
President's message for the purpose of reference.

that if petitions could not be referred before the

sage could not.

Tne SPEAKER here announced that peliiions
were in order, and called for petüions irom the
State of Maine.
Mr. CUSHING begged leave to ask the Chair if
there was not a subsisting order for the election of
a Chaplain in the motion of his colleague. As
that related to the organization of the House, he
supposed it would have preference over other busi-
ness, and be thought they had better proceed to it
at once.
Mr. BRIGGS suggested ¡hat, as petitions had
been caled, it wou'd be necessary to move to post-
pone ¡hem for the present.
Mr. GUSHING accordingly moved to postpone
tie call for pitiuons m osder to go into the election
of a Chaplain.
The SPEAKER thought it would be in order to
proceed to the election, as it related to the organi-
zation of ihe House.
