Major General D. S. STANLEY,

Commanding Fourth Army Corps:

I have messages by signal from Kenesaw and Allatoona. All quiet. Davis is following you. If General Elliott can get to Powder Springs and Dallas I may not move any more troops, but I want you to make the road hence to Allatoona and Etowah bridge all secure.

Major General D. S. STANLEY:

Certainly, you should have a telegraph operator, if I have to send my own. One is already gone to you. Develop Hood's game. Keep infantry well in hand, and I will keep the Armies of the Ohio and Tennessee ready to start at an hour's notice.

SMYRNA CAMP-GROUND, October 3, 1864-6. 30 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: We cannot get the telegraph to work, and I send this via the office at Chattahoochee bridge. I arrived here at 2. 30 p. m. General Davis is at Chattahoochee bridge, one DIVISION on this side, the other not yet across. I have sent word for him to come up to this point in the morning. I have heard no firing nor have I heard anything from the cavalry. Have communicated with General Vandever at Marietta. He reports that he sent scouts out ten milles WEST of Marietta to-night. If Hood shows any disposition to turn east I will move to Lost Mountain in the morning. Any message for me will have to be sent by the bridge.

Major-General.
