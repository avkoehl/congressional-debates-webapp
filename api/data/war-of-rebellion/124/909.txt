WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 22, 1863.

His Excellency OLIVER P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana, Indianapolis, Ind.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that Indiana's quota of the 300,000 volunteers called for by the President's proclamation of the 17th instant is as follows: First District, 1,830; Second District, 1,370; Third District, 1,535; Fourth District, 1,222; Fifth District, 1,448; Sixth District, 1,978 Seventh District, 1,755; Eighth District, 1,839; Ninth District, 2,097; Tenth District, 2,020; Eleventh District, 1,903; total, 18,997.

Inasmuch, however, as there remains to the credit of Indiana 1,669 men, the surplus of her excess over all former calls as compared with the quota due from her on the current draft, the quota named above (18,997), in case a draft is rendered necessary by a failure to raise volunteers, will be reduced by that number (1,669)-that is to say, to 17,328, which number, in reference to such draft, will be subject to a further reduction to the extent of all volunteers not hitherto credited, and such as may be raised in pursuance of the proclamation aforesaid.

If Your Excellency thinks best to subdivide the quota herein assigned to Congressional districts, and allot proportional parts to smaller subdivisions of your State, I would suggest that for harmonizing the subject of credits hereafter you regard the enrollment of the first class made by this Bureau as the basis of assignment.

The provost-marshal-general of your State and the boards of enrollment in the several districts will give you all the aid in their power in this and all other matters connected with raising troops.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
