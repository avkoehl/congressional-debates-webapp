And now, when the banks  have ¡suspended payments,
universally when the internal exchanges are ail deranged, and
th business of the country iaoh*, seriously interrupted, the
questions aie—
Whether the measure fee^ie us issu'table to our conchtion?
and,
Whether it is a just and proper exereise and fulfilment of
the p rwers and duties of Cunííresb'í
W hat, then, sir, will be the practical operation and effect Of

Like its predecessor of the last session, the bill proposes no-
thing ior the general currency of the country, nothing to re
&tore exchange , nothing to bring about a speedy resumption;
of &pe< ie payments by the banks Its whole piofesbed object is
the collection and disbuHementof the public revenue Suras of
i sjriendb indeed say, that when it shall go into operalion, it
will incidan* ally % ¡ loduce- a favorable efet t i i the currency,
by restraining the sue of bank paper But others r ress it a&

\re we to understand then, that it is intend* d, by means, of
which this i the fii t, to rid the country of all banks, as being
butso many nuisai ecs, and to abolish all paj ei cunency what-
evert
Oris it expected on the coniraiy, that ater this sybieni shall
be adop ed foi tbeu«e oí Qrovernmeut, there will still be a paper
currer cy m the country for tl e u^e of the people*
And if theie shall still be a paper currency, will that curren
cy consist of uredeemable Government paper, oi of convertí
ble bank no es, such as ha^ e circulated leietofore? These
questions must be answeied, before we can judge accurately of
