first fixed the rate of interest by law so far below the
natural rate in this country—although it was bull
above that of older nations—that it almost amounted
to a prohibition to the citizens to borrow directly from
abroad, and yet they managed, by a circuitous
mode, to force upon us the use of foreign capital,
at an exorbitant iafe of interest, and in, a manner
wnich charged w ith this expense the great mass of
the commumtj, whilst a few only enjoyed the pe-
culiar ad/antages of the loan Banks were incor-
porated, with the power to make the money which
they were to lend, tbey were permitted to issue twice
or thrice the amount of their capital, and although
they were not permitted to charge more than the
legal ra e of interest upon any one loan, yet the
device was created by which they1 might derive
twice or three ímes that rate of interest upon their
capital The fleet of these double laivs was to
force the greater portion of the demand for capital
upon the banks, and this demand was for as much
capital as could be employed profitably at the legal
rate of interest The natural demand for capital,
of course, was for as much as could be profit-
ably employed at the natural rate of interest,
which was alw-ys higher than that fixed by
law. Tiie natural demand, therefore, w as smaller
m amount lha i that thus created by artificial
means As if ihe vigorous appetite of high and
youthful health w as net sufficient, we offered unna-
tural stimulants, that it might be ravenous enough
to devour the food which  e were about to provide
for it, and wmch otherwise it might have refused
In tracing, then, the opeiations of our laws regu-
lating the banking sys'em upon our people, this
was Ihe fnst sUp Theie was a difficulty m procur '
mg food enough to satisfy the wants jt natural
hunger, and «e begin the task of sunplymg it, oy
provoking tms appetite to further excesses
Let us look, now, to the nature of the food which
we were preparing for its use    These banks were
endowed with tne exclusive privilege of issuing
paper money, which was received by Government
tor   its   dues, whJst all    artificial means were
used to give ii currency    The entire amount of
money loanpd by   the banks beyond their specie
oipital consi  e 1  of their own credit, issued m the
form of a circuiting medium   Bank credit, in the
shape of a circulating rvdium, was placed on the
same tooting (.so far as Government coulu make
t so,) not oi iy   with specie as a currency, but
with real cipita1, inasmuch as no mire interest
could be charg d upon a loan of real capitu han
upon the loan of this species of credit    The con-
sequence was that the cheapest currency took the
place of the dearer, but better, and the cheaper
substitute for capital was used instead of real ca-
pital, becau e t e latter could rot come into com-
petition with the former upon fair terms, and be-
cause those  w io held the latter, would prefer  to
invest it in banks, through whose peculiar privi-
leges they might derive more than the legal inte
rest to which they w tre confined if they had at-
tempttu to loan it as individual     The  effect of
these laws w as to force  the g eat portion of the
demand for capitil by  the community upon the
banks, where thej obtained credit as its substitute,
which was lte ned, too, in the shape of currency     !
Of course, these regulations naturally produced an
inflation of the currency, and  a rise oi prices, not
real, but nomiml     I have once before endeavored
to demonstrate the  process by which this expan
..lor  of  the currency produces a rise in prices,
\ hich, reacting  again, by increasing the nominal    .
amoi it of c?p tal  demanded by  the commumtj,    i
causes another expansion of this bubole of curren-    I
cy until it bur is, and, therefore, I shall not now    i
weary  the committee by repeating the  view,   it   j
is enough for me that we all see how these banks,
finding it to their interest to issue as much curien-
cy as they can,  expand it, without regard  to the
level of the currenciesm other poitions of the world
This, then, is the second step in the  operation oi
this system, and here the foieign capitalist, who
had been excluded before, except as the stockho d-
er of a bank, cimes m to claim his  usury under
he fiction of price    The money price of his com
modules becomes not only higher than its natural
price here, but so much higher than the nominal
pnce in other countries  having a les  inflated eur-

rency, that capital laid out abroad m commodities,
to be sent here, is more profitable than irr any
other investment So long as the foreign mer-
chant sold more than he bought here, it mattered
liitle that he took such of our production1! as fur-
nished the raw material for his manufactures at
a price enhanced somewha,t beyond its real value
The balance of trade was m his favor, and the ar-
tificial rise in prices afforded him an enormous inte-
rest upon his investment This balance, if regu-
larly withdrawn as it accrued, would have operated
as a check upon the issues of the banks, by pro-
ducing a run upon them for specie, which is the
only money of the whole world But there are
several causes which would always prevent this,
for a time at least In the first place the foreign
merchant w ould not care to withdraw these balances
so long as he could keep up his stock in trade by
borrowing at home, because the legal rate of inte-
rest here, though below its natural standard, was
still above that which was paid upon capital bor-
rowed in older countries, and because, too, he
w ould be naturally averse to disturbm" a trade
which u as so profitable to him, by making it, in
any avoidable respect, inconvenient to his custo-
mer. In addi ion to this, the expense of with-
drawing this capital was something, whilst another
cau=e, also, operated to prevent an early settlement
of these balances, wh'ch might have checked,
graduilly, the mischievous effects of this artificial
rise in prices Our Goveinments, State and Fede
ral, fiom time to time, have issued large amounts
of S'ate stock--, negotiated generally through the
banks end in exchange for their paper The
transfer of this Government ciedtt abroad absorbed
a large aiieant of the debt due upon the balance
of trade, and thus its payment m monev was avoid-
ed by charging posterity with the debt The banks,
too, b} tins liberal use of Stat" credit, were enabled
to continue the process of expansion, and
the foreign capitalist was allowed to extend
his usurious operations upon this country, under
the legal fictions of artificial prices Rut notwith-
standing this extravagant use of Government cre-
dit, throi'gh which a mortgage, estimated at
§100,000,000, upon the property of the country, is
held by foieign capitalists, the day of payment
came at last When it did come, and the money
of the world was demanded, it was found that, for
my real practical purpose, the pretence of comer
tibihtj wasafic'nn ™ne banks were unable o
meet then engagements It was impossible to pro-
cuie specie, w n ch alone answered for rem ttances
abroad, except at the heaviest expense, and we were
forced to ley upon the productions and property
of the coiir-try, at prices reduced te the specie stan-
dard, for the payment of the debt thus cor racted
to foiei^ners Upon whom, then, did the li ss fal i ,

banking privilege and recen ed its favors Trace,
Mr Cnairmpn, the entire circuit or capital as it
passes frc m the bank to the w holesale merchant,
thence to the retiil dealer, and then e to the con- j

vernment' for the people* By no means, sir. The
only extraordinary advantages derived by any dur-
ing the process, is derived by the banks. Tb,ey
alone receive more than legal interest upon their
capitals, and when the suspension of specie pay-
ment takes place, theirs is not the suffering ff
they make common cause their charters are safe,
because no Government dares take them away; and,
m a pecuniary point of view, their extraordinary
profits continue, ii they have been conducted with
tolerable prudence It they are not forced to cur-
tail, they derive interest upon more than their
capital, and if they do curtail, they buy in the pro-
perty of their debtors at low prices, which was
mortgaged to them for money when it was cheap
and prices were high Nay, sir, there are various
means by which they can make this period of
suspension their principal harvest, although I hope
there are many which have never practised this
fraud They may use their specie, by means of
secret agents, to buy m their own paper at a dis-
count, or, if this be thought too dangerous a game,
thev may transfer their specie funds to distant cities,
and, under a pretence of exchange, buy in their
own notes, so as to make a profit by their deprecia-
t on If I am correct, then, Mr Chairman, m
these conclusions, this is a system which taxes the
entire productive industry of the country for the
benefit of the few, and the class upon which th s
burden falls first and heaviest is the laboring class,
for it is an established maxim in political economy,
that labor is the last thing to feel a rise m prices,
and one of the first affected by their fall
And this is the system which we must strain
every smew to foster, or we are to'd that credit and
commerce will perish Tnis is the appetite which
we must exhaust the means of Government to gorge,
or we are to be called Loco Tocos, Agrarians, Level-
lers, and I know not what else, that is opprobrious.
The=t; are the institutions so nece--sary to the
community that we must make our very Govern-
ment dependent upon them to obta n their good
offices Mr Chairman, if it be so odious and
criminal, as I admit it to be, to take the property of
the fe / to distribute amongst the many, I asir how
is it with him who would reverse the proposition,
and 'ake the p operty of the manv for the benefit
of the few? In times long gone m merry England,
it was recoided in the epitaph of Robin Hood, as
one of the virtues of this renowned freebooier, that
' For fifteen > ears an I ori)°thmg more,

For one, sir, I never admred the sentiment, not-
withstanding the excuse to be foun' for it in the
a e which gave it birth, but I think I shou d have
admired the eulogy not more, or scarcely as much,
il  ts sentiment had been reversed
Mr. Chairman, I hold no Government as better
than a sy stem i f licensed robbery, which does not
íespect as ho y tne private rights to property, and
which preserves not irviolate its own engagements
For this reason I would encourage no measure
whose object was to deny the banl s their just
rig its, or io encourage Government in the \iola-
tion of the faith which it ha-- pughted to them, but,
on thf other hand, I will expose what I believe to
be the vices of the system, because I would effect,
by all legitimate means, a just and tempeiate re-
torm in these mstitu ion1- 1 will never consent 11
any system of privileged p'undei either m tie
many or the few, and the banks thernselvs may at
