JULY 9, 1863.

Major [J. R.] ROBERTSON,

Commanding Thirty-second Battalion Virginia Cavalry:

MAJOR: The enemy are falling rapidly back. They are ordered to Yorktown. They are on their way to join Hooker. They camped last night at Captain Morris`, on the Telegraph road. I got into their camp near Dr. Richardson`s house this morning. They are in sight as I write this. I am going to follow them down to Williamsburg. The Disacund road is open.

Respectfully,

CARROLL.

JULY 9, 1863-4 p. m.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, C. S. A.:

From Colonel Shingler`s report, I think there can be but little doubt that the Yankees are moving rapidly back. A small force may be kept under cover of their works and gunboats for days and even weeks at the White House for the purpose of deception.

Is it proposed to send off any force to cover General lee`s retreat? May not the Yankees establish themselves at Winchester, and starve his army to death?

It may be that Dix`s command may be hurrying to Washington to relieve Heintzelman, who will be thrown to Lee`s rear.

Whatever the plans of the Department are, I will try to execute, them promptly.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
