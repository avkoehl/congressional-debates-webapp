WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 3, 1862.

His Excellency H. R. GAMBLE,

Governor of Missouri, Saint Louis, Mo.:

SIR: In reply to yours of Augusta 27, relative to the transfer of the Thirteenth Regiment Missouri Volunteers and asking that the companies mustered in Missouri be transferred to a Missouri regiment, I am directed to say that this transfer was made in conformity with General Orders, Numbers 18, current series, which was made without any reference to this case. The order is certainly reasonable and proper. It is impossible to make the transfer asked without producing confusion in the records of the regiment and injury to the interests of the service.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 3, 1862.

Honorable A. SAUNDERS,

Governor of Nebraska:

SIR: In reply to yours of 25th ultimo I am directed to say that your views concerning the paramount necessity of filling up the old regiments coincide with those of this Department. It is not considered desirable to raise a regiment for home service as you suggest, and can not, therefore, be authorized.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

TRENTON, N. J. September 3, 1862-10 a. m. (Received 12 m.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON:

The call made upon the State for three-years's men is full. The last regiment leaves the State this week. The call for militia, over 10,000, is full and ready to move when mustered and equipped. No draft is necessary. It is my wish to have these troops

accepted as nine-months" volunteers if possible. Answer.

CHAS. S. OLDEN,

Governor of New Jersey.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., September 3, 1862.

His. Excellency Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

List of provost-marshals received. The Secretary does not propose to appoint so many. No more than two have been appointed to a State hitherto. He suggests six for Ohio--say one at Cleveland, Toledo, Cincinnati, Portsmouth, Steubenville, and Columbus each, or in those parts of the State.

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.
