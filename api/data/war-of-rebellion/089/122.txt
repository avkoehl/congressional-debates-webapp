HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

In the advance of the Fifth Corps picket there was such a gap made from right to left that General Crawford says it will take 140 men to fill up the gap. It is filled, however, but General Crawford asks me to replace the men, which I submit to you for your decision. You well know what parties, if any, should be called upon to furnish. I had ordered it filled up, but when I sent to have it done found that it had been filled by Fifth Corps.

Major-General.

Is this so, or must an additional number be put on picket, whether your line is advanced or not?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

The commanding general desires to be informed whether this connection can be properly made by moving forward your left; and, if so, that it will be done without further orders.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

I advanced my whole picket-line this morning by orders from General Meade. It will take 140 men to make the connection good between your left and my right. I supplied a portion of the men this morning, and will be glad if you will send the requisite number to relieve the
