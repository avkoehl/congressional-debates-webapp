Mr. STOCKTON. Mr. President, thesourcc
from whence tiiia bill comes assures me as
well as every other Senator that the object of
the bill is such as is stated in its title. The
tille of the bill is :
An act to authorize the appointment of shipping
commissioners bv tho several circuit courts ot tho
United States to superintend tho shipping anil dis-
charge ut'seamen eniiaKcd m merohantsbips belong-
ing to tho United States, and for tho further protec-
tion of seamen.
I do not rise to object to tho hill; I do not
know that 1 shall object- to it; but it is a bill
of fifty pages. I rise pimply lor the purpose
of asking the Senator who lias charge of it if
the bill bus been carefully considered, and if
we may take it for granted, not having an
opportunity out selves of examining it, that
the members of the committee have examined
it sufficiently in all its particulars to state that
it is really lor the benefit of seamen, and can
do no injury tu our merchant marine?
It is fifty pages of a code of laws to govern
the met chant marine. It, is an alteration of
the rules of courts of admiralty. It is an al-
teration of the contracts betwum seaman and
(heir employers. It is certainly prepared with
the intern ion of protecting and benefiting ihe
poor seamen ; but I have not been able my-
self, in a hasty reading of it, to ascertain
whether there may not be matters m it which
have not been carefully considered. I do not
intend to object to the bill, but I dcsiie to ask
a question or two in regard to it. Jn the first
place I should like to ask. if it is not improper
for the committee to tell me, how this bill
originated, what was the object of the hill,
whether it originated from complaints made
by seamen or anything of that character,
which would satisfy myself and other Sena-
tors that this measure came from those who
