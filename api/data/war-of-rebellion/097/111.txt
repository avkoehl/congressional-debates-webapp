Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

The troops for Sherman's army passed Cincinnati on the 20th for Washington. Have been delayed by loss of railroad bridges. vessels are here ready on their arrival to take them to Beauford, N. C. The Nineteenth Corps has been discontinued. As soon as it is determined what troops are to remain in West Virginia I think they should be consolidated as the Fight Corps.
