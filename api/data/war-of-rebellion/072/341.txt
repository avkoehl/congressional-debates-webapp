days, and is succeeded by Dr. Tillson, Fifty-seventh Indiana Volunteers, a competent officer; Captain Howard, provost-marshal; Captain G. A. Lemert, topographical engineer; to Captain Munger, acting commissary of subsistence, and Lieutenant Sterne, acting assistant quartermaster, who had but few equals in their departments; Lieutenant Sterne should be promoted for long and faithful service of nearly three years. Captain John. W. Aughe, inspector, deserve commendation. Lieutenant George W. Rouse, who was my inspector until the 30th of July, while inspecting the picket-line in front Atlanta a cannon ball took off his leg, from which he died.

He was on of the most correct young men it was my fortune to know, as well as an accomplished officer. To know him was to love him, and had he lived would have been a man of worth. Lieutenant Royse was twice wounded at Resaca, with shell in the arm, and at New Hope Church by mine-ball in the head, severely, but is on duty. Lieutenant Cox was slightly wounded at New Hope Church.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. D. WAGNER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
