If the assault is made to the left of General Birney and he retain only a thin line I ought not to send away more than one brigade, say of 1,400 men, leaving 2,500 in my line.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I have strongly intrenched my position within some 400 yards of the enemy's line of rifle-pits. I find a second creek or ravine, the steep banks of which offer serious obstacles to a successful assault. I have my troops formed in two lines, commencing on my left with Brewster's brigade, Colonel Bell (Eighteenth Corps), General Mott, Ramsey, Fraser, and have just prolonged my line to the right by sending in the small brigade from Eighteenth Corps, Colonel Henry. This places this brigade on General Smith's left in advance, and relieves General Gibbon's line and pickets, and [sic] battle, leaving also two brigades of mine in reserve and available. I think the assault should be made at some other point, as they seem to have concentrated a large force in my front, covering the Prince George road, which is my center.

Respectfully,

COLONEL: In answer to circular of this date I would report that it would require my division to hold securely my present line. I have relieved all other troops that were temporarily with my command excepting the battalion heavy artillery on fatigue duty. I could spare this battalion for the assault.

I am, yours, respectfully,
