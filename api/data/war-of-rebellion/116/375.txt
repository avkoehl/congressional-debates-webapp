Captain JAS. A. EKIN,

Assistant Quartermaster, Indianapolis, Ind.

CAPTAIN: I have been thinking about the barracks in which the prisoners at Camp Morton are quartered, heretofore occupied by your troops; they are very dark and close and there must be much sickness among the prisoners unless some improvements are made. There should be some windows put in such as I spoke of for the buildings you put up, enough to give air and light, and if more room inside could be given by taking out some of the bunks it would be very advantageous. The buildings are too much crowded for warm weather. Put in windows and see what can be done in the other matter.

I am authorized to provide sheets for such of the sick men as may require them. Please ascertain what number is really necessary at your hospitals and at Lafayette and furnish them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Lieutenant Colonel Eighth Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Captain J. A. POTTER,

Assistant Quartermaster, U. S. Army, Chicago, Ill.:

Please supply the sick prisoners at Camp Douglas and Camp Butler with sheets as far as may be necessary to save them from suffering. There are many sick who can very well do without sheets and I will be obliged to you if you will call on the surgeon in charge of the hospital at Camp Butler for the number he requires. They are much in want of them at Camp Butler and to save time please send them 150 pairs. If they require more the doctor can estimate for them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Lieutenant Colonel Eighth Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
