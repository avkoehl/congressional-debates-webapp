NASHVILLE, September 29, 1864-3 a. m.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Pulaski:

General Thomas telegraphs that you go by rail to Shelbyville and call your troops there, and report to him at Tullahoma. General Morgan's DIVISION, Fourteenth Corps, will be there as soon as possible. This order is based on the fact that Forrest has gone over to the Chattanooga road. Please answer my telegram as to when you will be here. General Thomas wants to know.

B. H. POLK,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

ATLANTA, September 29, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU, or

Major POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The commanding general says he will move with one DIVISION of the Fourteenth Army Corps to Stevenson, from which point he can move either to Tullahoma or to Decatur, and cut Forrest's communications. If you can force the enemy from the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, the movement on Decatur would be best. The commanding general wishes you to telegraph him at Stevenson all you know or can learn of Forrest, his movements and plans.

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
