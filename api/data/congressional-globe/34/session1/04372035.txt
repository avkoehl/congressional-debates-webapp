Mr. CAMPBELL. Well, then,I will simply ji
make the report. ]:
Mr. HOUSTON. I desire to ask the srentle-j'

in writing, and read'y for the press. I:
Mr. COBB. There is no objection, I appro- |:
hend, upon the part of the minority ol the Com-
miLteeol Ways and Means that this report should '
be made at this time, and ordered to be printed; j|
cind there was no objection on tlx: part of the >
majority of the committee thattlie minority should j
present ami print their report as soon as it was
ready to be submitted to the House. I hope it ;
will be so understood by the House. j
Mr. ELOBENCE. I wish to ask a question
of the gentleman from Georgia. Will that report
be made drains this week, or before the adjourn- ,
mem of Congress : :
Mr. CUIjB. I state frankly to the iientl'mian
**iom Pennsylvania, that I do not think u will,
;mu I on^lit on t;ive my reasons wh\ ihe mi- 1
>e-<rny rejiort iias not beeuond \\ ill not be prepared j
mid \j<: sul uiUed this session. ,
Mr. CA \1 Pi >EF jL. 1 will sunplv say m iefer- !
oner to ilns uuuter, that the Commiru e of Ways '
ami Means have had tins very mjjnutam subject 1
'jiid'T consideration during1 th<> session, but from |
a combination of circumstances have been unable :
to report befor". J
Mr. REWARD. I rise to a question of order. ,
A* I h i.-> debate in oidei : if it is not, L object ro it. i
TuertrUAHlEll. It is not; ami the e<-ntleman :
.rum New York objects to the report being made. .
Mr. CAAJPHELL. Then J move that lhe ;
rules be Mispendedjto enable me to make the ,
i'eport. !
Air. JONES, of Tennessee. I would surest ,
to tie- £enti( man from Ohm, that he should move :
to postpone the consideration of the bili until the
next session, instead of makmgit a special order. \
Mr. CAMPBELL. Well, i \\d! modify my
motion according tu that suggestion, and trust to
the action of the House next session to make it
a spt-eial order. !
The bill was then reported, and read a fust and
second time by Us title, as follows: 1
" A bill to reduce the duty on imports, ami for
Other purposes.''
Mr. CAMPBELL. I m,w move that tin fur-
ther consideration ol the hill be postponed until
'he third Monday m December next, ae.d that it
be printed with the report of the majority.
The moiion was agreed to.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I have also sent up reso- ;
lutions of inquiry addressed to the Secretary ot |
the Treasury, with a view to ascertain_ some ,
important statistics which will have a bearing on j
the merits of the bill and of the report, when they j
shall have been presented. 1 ask that the reso- j
iutions may be adopted. 1
Mr. COBB, of Georgia. I desire to h;i\e them j
read for information, a.s tins is the fu&itimo 1 .
iurve heard of them.

Mr. CO BR. [ Would state to the £eiitleman
' f'-om Ohio, that 1 cannot consent to the introduc-
tion of these resolutions—as they rowr a large
mass of important questions—until an opportu-
nity shall have been presented to me of seeing
tlirni. They have been now oifeied und will he
. printed in the Globe, and we shall ?•">• them,
i When 1 sec them, and get such amendments to
i thorn as I think ought to he made, I may not
; object: but at present I must object,
i Mr. CAMPBELL. These resolutions call for
I information which will affect the vauous interests
j of the different sections of this country. 1 think
; it important that the House should possess jiself
; of this mforn'ution, by the next session oi (,'on-
. CTi'oss. As the gentleman fiom Georgia obji cds,
■ I move to SHopeinl the ruh'.s.
: Air. JO"NKS, -'>f Tcniu'ssee. I want 'o inquire
! whether this is a r-'port from ihe Conmntn f ol ■
; Ways and M".ins3
: Air. CAMPBELL. It is a report from tlie
1 majority of the committee accompanying the bill
■ and reuoit presented.
Air.'JONES. I understand that neither of the
f members of the committee on this side of the
i House has ever scon these resolutions*.
Mr. CAMP13LLL. The of the
■' minority know verj1" well that tin ie was n com-
mon understanding between us—the mnjorny
having agreed to report a bill predicated upon
certain principles in regard to the revenue, and
! the minority di.sasTOC'in^ with [hem m regard to
: the rules which should be adopted. It was well
understood that the majority should make its
. report, at any tinm it was prepared to do so, mul
that the minority should ha\e time to make their
1 report. Now-, we luive submitted our report, and
>■ uller iesolntions asking information m regard to
'j the btihjecf; and I am astonished that the £vntle-
r man from (reor,!?ia should object to these resolu-
. tions.
Air. COBK. I trust I shall be allowed to say
one word.
AJr. CAA1PDELL. I will twv to the gentleman
that I shall make no objection to any resolution,
the minority may choose to submit, calling for
information.
Mr. COBB. The gentleman from Ohio has
correctly stated what occurred in the Committee
of Ways and Means, in reference to this report—
that the majority should make their report, as ho
has snid, and that the minority should have the
opportunity of making theirs hereafter. But
what 1 wish to say to the House is this: 1 have
never seen these resolutions before, nor had J any
idea that any .such information was to be called
for by the majority of the Committee of Ways
and Means.
Air. CAMPBELL. Tlie gentleman from
Georgia has been absent for some days. { brought
the report and resolutions to the room of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, and left them there
for the examination of all the members of the
committee.
Air. COIjB. I am not complaining of the
gentleman from Ohio. I am stating to the House
my reasons for objecting: to these resolutions.
Mr. CAMPBELL. The resolutions are a part
of the report of the committee.
Air. COBB. J do not regard them as a part
of the leportof the committee, i had no idea
1 that any resolutions were to be introduced. But I
! want the gentleman and the House to understand
' my position. When I have had an opportunity
! of seeing the resolutions, and of so amending
! them that they shall call for information bearing
| upon every branch of the subject to which they
1 refer, I will not object.
| Air. HOUSTON. 1 desire to say a single
j word. I regard (he resolutions as calling for one-
| .sided information upon the subject. [Cries of
! " Order!'']
j The sSPEAJvER. Debate is in order only by
1 unanimous consent.
Air BENSON called for tellers on the motion
to suspend the rules.
j Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Sapp and
1 Winsi.ow were appointed,
! The qui stion was put; and the tellers reported
