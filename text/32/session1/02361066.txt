THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 14,
sums paid to the grantees of the Government for !
lands granted to States, companies, and individuals j
not included m the ordinary s^Ies, estimatingthese i
lands at the minimum only, amount to $13,036,968. j
The vast aggregate swells to £33,890,664. Make
every deduction from this sum which any fair
consideration ran suggest; exclude the value of the
grants to individuals—such as the grants to John
Cleves Symmes and the Ohio company, and the
grants for military servic.es—and still the amount
paid by the people of Ohio to this Government and
its grantees, for the soil on whirh they live, and
from which they draw, by honest toil, the means
of life, will greatly exceed $30,000,000.
The history of the world does not afford another
instance of the original ownership of wild lands
being acquired by the inhabitants of any State or
country at such a price.
I will now state somewhat more particularly the
grants made to Ohio for education, internal im-
provements, and other purposes, and compare
their amount with similar grants made to other
States.
The grants made to Ohio, are these:
For schools, colleges,&c. ... 737,528 acres.
For internal improvements.. 1,243,001 "
Fur swamp lands  303,329 "
In all   2,'273,858 "
The Senate will observe that 1 have included
every grant of every kind made to the State. The
sections sixteen, for the use of schools—all the
canal lands—all the swamp lands—aie included;
and the total is nearly 500,000 aeies less than
the single giant to the State of Illinois in aid of
her Central Railroad, at tlie firstsession of the last
Congress.
But 1 mvifenttention to the grants made to other
States, a little more in detail.
There have been granted to the State of Indiana:
For schools, colleges, &c. ... 673,357 acres.
For internal improvements..! 6Ui),86l "
- For public buildings  2,560 "
For swamp lands   9^1,682 "
Making an aggregate of. ..3,267,460 "
The grants to Indiana exceed the grains to Ohio
by nearly 1,000,000 of acres.
There have been granted to Illinois—
For schools, colleges, .. .1,001,795 acres.
For internal improvements.. 500,000
For public buildings  2,500 "
For swamp lands .....1,833,412 "
For Central Railroad 2,700,000 "
Making an aggregate of...6,036,767 (i
The quantity granted to the Cenhal Railroad is
not precisely ast't'i fdiiu'd. It is set down in the
official tables at 2,216,100 acres: but these figures
aie co' fninly much below the leal quantity. In
the debate on the Iowa Kind bill, Senators who
sustained the Illinois ffrant, staled the quantity to
be from 2,500,000 to 2,700,000; and 1 have reason
to believe the largest quantity is not outside the
truth. It appears, then,that the grants to Illinois
exceed the grants to Ohio by more than 3,700,000
acres.
There have been granted to Missouri—
For school, colleges, Sec. .. .1,222,17!) acres.
For internal imrnovements. . 500,000 "
For public, buildings  2,560 "
For swamp lands.   1.517,2S7 "
Making an aggregate of.. .3,214,206 "
The grants to Missouri fall short of the grants
to Illinois by 2,750,000 acres; but exceed the grants
to Ohio by nearly 1,000.000 of acres.
There have been granted to Iowa—
For schools, colleges, &c 951.224 acres.
For internal improvements... .825,078 **
For public buddings   3,480 "
For swamp lands 33,813 "
Add DesiV [oines lands claimed,
say 900,000 «
Making an aggregate of. ..2,713,595 "
The grants to Iowa, the youngest of the land
States, exceed the grants to Ohio, the oldest, ex-
cept Tennessee, nearly 500,000 acres, while they
fall short of the grants to Illinois by 2,250,00*0
acres.
I will not extend this comparison. I will merely
add, that Alabamaalone, of all the land States, has
not received grants largely exceeding the quantity
granted to Ohio; that Alabama has received nearly
as much, and that there remains in that State
15,426,566 acres undisposed of, of which I, for
one, am ready to grant ner enough, at any time,
to make her equal, in this respect, to the most fa-
vored State. I will hand to the reporter a state-
ment prepared early in this session at the General
Land Office, at my instance, of the condition of
the public lands up to the 30th of September last,
by which any one, so disposed, can test the accu-
racy of the statements T make.**
I make no complaint of our sister States. I do
not regret that they have received much because
Ohio has received comparatively little. 1 rejoice
rather m the liberality which has been exhibited
towards them, and congratulate them on their
prosperity, promoted and stimulated by the wise
and just beneficence of the NaUonal Government.
May it increase more and more, and continue for-
ever.
In truth, Mr. President, this prosperity, though
promoted nnd stimulated, as I have just said, by
the beneficence of the Government, is due, in a
far greater measure, to individual energy and indi-
vidual intelligence, assured of protection in their
freest arid fullest development by the strength of
our American Union ana the spirit of our A'meri-
( can institutions, and operating either directly or
; through voluntary associations and the State Gov-
j ernments. Of this great benefit, Ohio has par-
' taken no less than her sister States. Unannoyed
, by external aggression, except for a short period
l during the second war with England,undisturbed
' by internal commotion, she has strenuously uiged
j her upward way, without pause, for sixty-five
I years. For fifteen years, while a part of the
; Northwestern Territory, she shared the fostering
care of the National Government. Admitted into
the Union as a sovereign State in 1802, she cheer-
| fully submitted to the condition imposed upon
i her, that the national domain within her limits
1 should be reserved to the United States, as prop-
] erty exempt from taxation, to be sold and applied
i in discharge of the national indebtedness. And
, it was not till the debt of the Revolution had been
fully paid, and the debt of the war of 1812 had
1 been reduced to an inconsiderable amount, that
Ohio ever applied for any grant of lands in aid of
1 any of her works of internal improvement. Un-
] assisted, her people bought their faims, felled the
1 forest, built their log cabins, reared their school-
houses, constructed their churches. Unassisted,
j they joined the lake to the river by the Ohio canal,
} and thus completed the first internal waterway
i from the Atlantic ocean to the Gulf of Mexico.
