HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Saturdvy, January 18, 1^40
The SPEAKER nouttced to the House that the subject be-
fore it was die special or 'er, being the pro >osition oC Mr
Th >MpsoN,of Sjuth Carolina,to amend the rules by the addition
of the tollowtng

jvaper, shill h lonst leied asohj ted to and the question of
its i tceplion (hull be laid on the tab'e, without debate, or further
action thereon
Mr M,ADE, who was entitled to the floor upon this subject,
was proceeding, butwas wteriupted by
Mi I EET, who asked him to gi e way for the purpose of
enabling him to make amotion that the House proeeed to the
election of public punter He said that it was indispensably
necessary tria ptovt^ion should be made to have the printing
execute 1—tl at the f ubltc husmees was suffering Tt e chair
man of the < ommitlee of \V i> s and Mt ans made a motion, on
vesterday to provide temporarily loi pnnling,ithping he said on
the «round that it was absolutely necessiry lo facilitate the public
business Mr L was progressing in some luithei remark ,
when he was interrup ed by
Mr SL\DE, who chimed to proceed with his remarks, but
Was aeain in eirupte 1 by
Mr BlDDLE, w ho vv,«hed, he eaid, to present to the House a
pent on with which It had been charged tor seveial dajs, on
the suhjeit of ea etv guari'sto prove it explosions of steam-
boa s
Mi SLVDEsiid ihat if any wav could be devised for him
to permit (lie motions, and yet retain the floor upon the question
bet>re le House, he wuull willingly )ield, on which sugges
uonheytclled, when
Mr I'lDDl E made a motion that the petition would he
received by universal consent, and referred to a select commit
ts    but ntuection having been made to it  reception,
Mi THUbR rose and said 1 lie House will recol'ect that,
on yeste r lay, I ma 1 Known to it that 1 was ab em from the
hall when toe gentleman Iiom New York submittid a copy
of his letter to G uei d Green, and his remar«g upon it, and
that 1 could not then akerotice of them, for the reason that I
did not hear them I s ated, howevet, that when these remarks
shouldappear >n the papers, if I este mod them of such a cha
racier as to require a notice from me I should notice them this
morning 1 hive rt ad the report ol ihegenllemaii'siemarksin
tha National Intelligencer of this moimng-, and 1 take it for
granted that the report is correct, though I have been informed
by some gemlemen of this House tha' some thinss are report-
ed tohijve bten said by the gemleman which were not deli
vered by him to th<> Hon e Such as they were, they require
some s ighi no ice from me
I need scarcely allude to the circumstance that the gentleman
chose to deliver ihos  lemarks in my absence Whether this
was done inadvert<mlv, or wi h a view ol "managing the
thing adroitly," I leave it to this House to conclude, but 1 will
say lor mysell, thai Inrver will rise on this floor ond direct my
remarks to a gf-ntleman behind his bock, or in his absrnce I
look upon this proce lure as not in accordance with what a gen-
tleman should do But the letter of the sentleroan « before the
public, my statement is berore the public, the statement
of the gentleman is before the public, and I will leave it
to them to «ay whether the letter does not bear out every thing
I said What did Ieav 7 I wdt read an extract from the gen
tleman's letter to show how lully it agrees with my statement.
Mr F here read the foil  ing extract
"It has nccuired ti me and other of my political friends,
that suchanairanaemeut coulJ be made with you as would
justify the entire Whig party in support.ng you for that
office "
Now, wh-t was the mrangement that would justify the
etUire Whig rarly in sui port ng Gtn Green lor ihat office?
The letter lell     It is this
"Now, what had pa sed through my mi d, was «ímply this
that you should in the event of y ur elecnon, effer Gaits and
Beaton to thare equally with them, rerpectively, the profits of
the office, after allowing them a fair com  ensatmn out, for their
personal services, they to do a)j the work at tfceir office, and
you to be e'ectcd to the station
"The profits cannot be less for the whole Congress than
«3OO0O, this would give you «10000, you having no ttouble
oi responsibility whatever "
That is the consideration, Mr F said It is very true the
gentleman says he' suggests this on his own responsibility,
buthe goes on to say, but, «evertneless, 1 hazard nothma in
the conjecture, that if you are here and put in, the thing can be
managed adroitly enough to insure success " H now not, said
Mr F what the tentleman's ideas of ethies may be, he may
think there is nothing like bribery in his proposition, but I leave
it to the House and to the world to say whether its obiect was
not to move n a certain direction, antl off ring 810 000 to
pioducc a certain result If it were proper to refer to General
Green's letter, it would show that he looked upon the thing as
pomnnff directly to certain gentlemen in this House The
gemleman says he spoke of no Doles, and alluded to no particu
lar individual but was it to be supposed that he would come
out in a matt' r of this kind, and name individuals occupying a
particular position on this floorl The gent eman knows how
to l manage such things too adrmt'y" to become so very spc
cificas to name individuals, or even to name their party name
or designation My object, however, s^id Mr F in vising, is to
say that my statement is before the world, with the letter of th 
gentleman and his statement, and let the world judge how they
aeree together The main leading obiect of the gentleman s
letter, wis the offer of $10000 to produce a certain result I
stated that in so many words, and the letter will bear me
out in it
Mr MITCHELL said the House would bear him out in the
aseertion that he had aited throughout in this matter in self
defesce In reference to this business he was not iccountable
He rose yesterday toiedeem his piomtse to thellouse which
he made w hen fiist 1 e addressed them on the subiect, and was
not aware that the gentleman from North Carolina was not in
the Hall till he looked around andfoend his seat vacant He
had ffiven notice that as soon as lie received a copy of his letter
to General Green, lie would lay it b fore the House, and a' the
earliest moment after receiving it, he redeemed his promise
He would  now call the attention of the gentleman from North
Carolina to something in his statement which he. (Mr M )
wished him to explain—for itseemed strange that th" gentle
man should íecollectso distinctly the particular woids wh ch
appeir in the letter when they are not in it at all The gentle
man in this statement says
"The gentleman from Ne<v York commences the letter by
saying that it had been distinctly ascertained that Messrs
Gales and Seaton could not be elected public Printers, and that
his aversion to Mr Blair was so great that he was disposed to
go all lengths to defeat his election, and that he believed that,
by the acquis!'ion of afew votes, Gen Gieencouldbe elected "
Now, said Mr M there is not a single word of this character
in my letter I did not allude to the acquisition of a few votes,
nor did I say that my aversion to Mr Blair wis so great that I
woull go all lengths to defeat his election And 1 slid that I
did not wish Gen Green to do any act that was not justifiable
to his conscience and to the world It was to that particular
part of the gentleman's statement that I w ish to call his at
tenuon
Mr FISHER replied   In giving my statements, I did not
Fretend to give the exact words in the gentlemin's letter, nor did
pretend to give all that was in it I forsot the most ma erial
parts of it—I forgot all about " adrmt management " As to
what I said about Mr Blair, I ask il the letter does not justify
me in what I said 1 will quote the gentleman's own words
"I have a strong desire to defeat Blair and would be glad to
do so m a way to oblige you personally " But, sir, I have
done wi h the subject
Mr GRAVES here rose and called the attention of the House
to an article which appeared in the Globe of yesterday evening,
in which he said it was intimated that he had been guilty of a
tinesse by which a fraud was practised on the House Mi G
then read the following
'"In the House, the Abolition discussion Is continued Mr
CotEs's resolution, which would, if passed, have closed ihe de.
bate, was laid on the table Mr Gkaves, Borne days ago,
moved a reconsideration, and this prevented Mr Thompson o{
Mississippi from moving it Mr Graves, to day, having car
ried the icconsideration, withdrew the mo ion, and so Mr
Coles's pr, position, was lost it ben g held ihat it was too late
for an> o her to move the reconsideration This looks like
finesse "
If, said Mr G I mane this motion, and had afterwards with-
drawn it with the view of preventing the gei tleman from Mis
siesippi, or any other gentleman, from making it, Ishculd have
commmed a fraud on him, and on the House, but my object is
now to show that I did no such thing 1 mentioned my mien
lion of moving the reconsideration to some gentlemen of the
House, and to ?vmd interfering with the discussion going on I
postponed it until the latest hour at w hich ll e motion conld be
made
When I thought 'he House was about to adjourn, I rose and
remarked to the Speakeb. that I offered mv motion now, be-
cause it could not be made after that day I did not observe
who had the floor, until the gentleman from Gcoigia observed
tiat he y« ¡d*d it lo me I then submitted the motion without
having heard from the gentleman from Mississippi, or wi hout
hav ng the least idea thai ho contemjlated making sueh a
motion, nor did I believe that he or any other aentleman in
tended to make it I should feel myself unwoithy of thefeitl
occupy here, if I were capable of deceiving any gentle
man, or by any sort of finesse preventing him ftom offer
mg a motion to this House Neither the gentleman from
Mississippi, nor any other gentleman, could say that he
desired to make such a motion When 1 perceived that
it was the determination of the House that if this recon
sideration prevailed, the question on the resolution of the
gentleman from South Carolina should be taken at once, and
thus cut off the debate—the remarks of the gentleman from
Georgia, [Mr CotatiiTT.] who yielded him tl e floor, among
others, I proposed to postpone the consideration until three
o'clock, and that proposition not appearing satisfactory, I pro.
posed to postpone it until twelve o'clock to day Both these
propositions appearing to be unacceptable, and finding that, by
persisting in my mc i«n the t'ehate won d be cutoff, I stated to
ihe House that I could accomplish my object in an independent
way, and would therefore withdraw my motion Bo sir the
charge that I was guilty of finesse, by wtich ihe gentleman
from Mississippi was prevented from making his motion, is
without any foundation
Before I take my seat, Mr G taid, I wish to make * remark
or two in relation to another charge against me, which origina
ted in the Government organ In a report of the Proceeding 
of this House made by the Globe in relation to the New Jersey
conies ed election caJ, he  asrtp«eecri.id as stying that 'Us

into a correspondence with the eth or of the Globe, the matter
I  rested    It  seems to me, saitl Mr   G   that when we admit
persons here as reporters of debates, if the  repoit remarks of
| persons to whom they aie p litirally oproseil, they should
do tt fairly, and not by reportu g one sentence, and suppressing
the qualification, convey a different idea of   the   speaker s
meaning     For my own part,  I  would not c.ire whether
the* reported   me at all—but  if they do report my re-
marks.  I   wish   then    to    report    all    that   1   say       If
I had known the Reporter of ihe Globe, who mare the re-
port to which I have adverted, 1 would have moved to expel
him from tne Hall    I will vote, Mr    G   said, to expelan/
Reporter from tins Hall who d ires to misrepresent a political
adversary by reporting a part of his speech ihat may do him
injustice, and not reporting the other part nece ary to make
him  understood     Alter some   further remaiks from   Mr.
Graves
Mr BOYD, of Kentucky, obsei ved that he was present, and
listened to the speech of his colleague on ihe New Jersey elec-
tion case, to which he referred, and he could, therefore, say,
that it was true that he did qualify his remaiks in relation to
loafers coming to claim seats here, so as to show that he did not
mean to app'y them to either sit'e of the New Jersey claimants.
With regard to the pari he to k or die s atement he made to
the Editor of the Globe, he would briefly s iy, that he met Mr.
Blair, and ¡^aied to him, that in ancditoual remark of his, he
had mi-s'ated Mr Graves and that that gentleman requested
him to make a correction Mi Blair denied that he had done
so in any editorial remark, and said that if there was a misstate-
ment of the gentleman,it m ust be in the report t f the proceedings
of the House, and, if so, he would with very great pleasure make
any corrections that Mr O might deem necessary He had no
doubt but   hat the report his friend refened lo was a misstate
ineut, and so heinfoimed the Editor, Lut he was under an im-
pression at the time that it was in an editorial remark The
Editors of the Globe had made no editorial remaiks in relation
to the subject, but said thai ifihere was a misstatement, it mu t
be in the report, ond that he would, with a creat deal of plea-
sure, insert any correction that the gentleni <n mightdcem ne-
cessary I thought it due to my co.league and to Mr Blair to
make this statement
M' GUAVCS I submit to my colleague whether I did not
request hnn to wait on Mr Blair, and lay to him that I had
beenmisiepreoented in a report in ihe Globe, and whether he
had not seen in the columns of the New York New Era an
article in which I w¿s grossly abus <!, in consequeice of the
remarks I was represented in the Globe to bave made And I
submit to him, Mr G said, whether I did not a ¡ ply to htm to
go to Mr Blair and get him to torrect theerioneots report,
without sid tecttng me to a corresporderCe
Mr BOYD It is true tint I saw a very abu«lve article m
the New \ ork Era, in relation to the remai ksatlnbuted to my
colteigue on the New Jersey election case, but I have not to
this day read the repor in the Globe on which my colleague
says it wis loutitled It is true my colleague came lo me, and
requested (hall would make ihe sugeestton to the Ednor of the
Globe, to correct the rep rt w hout subjecting him to a cor-
respnndence But I wen tu Mr B air, and he np led promptly
that his columns were open and that he would inseit any cor-
rection the gentleman mieht deem necessaty It is uue tlat
my colkajtue applied lo me to go again to Mr Blair, but It is
also true that I did not do it I felt that I had done my duty in
the part I had already taken
Mr STANLY observed that they would have notlun? else to
do, if they endeavored to correct the errors and falsehoods that
appealed in tint rapei
The SPEAKER called Mr Stanly to ord<r, anr, he took hid
seat
Mr THOMPSON of Mississippi said, as he had taken a pait
in this transection, it was due to the gentleman 1rom Kentucky
that he should make a sh< rt statement It was true he had
voted with ihe majority io\ y tre proposition of ihe gentleman
from.Virginia IMr Coles] on the table It was true that he
had had no coherence with the gemleman from Kentucky in
