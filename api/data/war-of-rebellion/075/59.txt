HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS, Two miles from Gordon's Gap, May 7, 1864-7 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: Struck junction of Alabama road and Nickajack Trace before Kilpatrick's cavalry got up. He came up in a few moments after. I have fifty of his men ahead reconnoitering Gordon's Gap to see whether it will be necessary for me to turn it by the foot-paths this side, which I shall do if there is any opportunity at the gap. Made a cut off at the junction of the Alabama and Nickajack the save any delay of columns by Williams or I uniting. Have directed my quartermaster to park my train on the left of the road I came on, near the junction of the two roads west of a little creek, where there is plenty of water and grass.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
