over to-day and look at it. The old work there can soon be put in condition to use if it is at any time necessary. We might occupy Franklin as far as the enemy is concerned, as there is but one regiment of rebels between us and Alexandria, and the force at Alexandria is too deficient in subsistence and transportation for it to make a move in force against us.

Major W. HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Southern Division of Louisiana:

The wind is south to-day, which swells the water some, but it is not rising as rapidly as it has heretofore. I visited the opposite side to-day and find no land which will be out of water if it rises eighteen inches more, except part of that made by the mounds inside of the old work, which will not be enough for this whole command. There is no emergency at present.

(Received 12 m.)

Major W. HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just received the following telegram from Colonel Fiske:

Lieutenant Kingsbury, of Brown's company, surrendered to the gun-boat Ouachita this a. m. He says that Brown intends to surrender his command, comprising eighteen men, to me to-morrow, provided they are allowed to retain their side-arms. The reason that they wish their arms is, they represent, for the purpose of defending themselves on their way home, which is in Western Arkansas. Please inform me just what terms I shall grant him.

W. O. FISKE,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

Can Colonel Fiske grant Brown and his army the same terms given by General Grant to General Lee? In my opinion Brown is an independent cutthroat, and should be made to surrender his arms or leave. The latter, I think, he finds it difficult to do on account of high water and scarcity of supplies. Please tell me what course we should pursue with him.

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.

[Indorsement.]

Any of the enemy's force on the west side of the river who will lay down their arms and surrender themselves as prisoners of war will be received and treated as such, the arms, of course, to be turned over to the receiving officer, to be accounted for as public property. No question of parole can be entertained except by the highest in authority.

T. W. S[HERMAN].
