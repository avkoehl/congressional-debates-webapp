ColonelC. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Captain Barber, of my command, in charge of detachment of sharpshooters on the Suck road, north of the river, reports very little firing on yesterday. The enemy busily engaged in chopping down timber, as if cutting a roadway. One man of the detachment wounded in the arm; 4 of the enemy hurt.

Respectfully submitted.

SIGNAL STATION, Cameron's Hill, October 18, 1863-4.20 p.m.

Captain MERRILL:

South 45 degrees east seventy-eight tents instead of fifty-eight, as a few days since. South 50 degrees east sixty tents half way up the side of Missionary Ridge and extending along the same.

See a brass cannon where the heavy gun was seen in small work. South 37 degrees east can see our own tents and a Sibley tent of the enemy's at the same time through the telescope-a fact I have not noticed heretofore. Some earth-works (unable to see the dimensions) extending toward the right from the right of the Sibley tent.
