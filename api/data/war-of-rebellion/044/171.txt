the direction or intention of this raid it is actually in motion ; hence the necessity of keeping forces well in hand for a sudden movement .

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief. . -

WASHINGTON,, D. C., June 11, 1863 .

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

Harper's Ferry is the important place . Winchester is of no importance, other than as a lookout . The Winchester troops, excepting enough to serve as an outpost, should be withdrawn to Harper's Ferry . The troops at Martinsburg should also be ready to fall back on Harper's Ferry. No large amount of supplies should be left in any exposed position .

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief. . -

WASHINGTON,, D. C., June 14, 1863 .

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

I have so repeatedly urged you to withdraw your main forces from Winchester, and so recently (the 11th) directed it, that I cannot understand how Milroy could have been left there to be invested . I repeat, you must concentrate on Harper's Ferry, not on Winchester or Martinsburg. If General Milroy does not obey your orders, remove him from command .

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief. .

WASHINGTON,, D. C., June 15, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

Don't fail to put every man not required as vedettes into Harper's Ferry defenses, there must be no delay in this. Detached forces will all be wiped out. Your engineer officer should be at Harper's Ferry, to assist in directing defenses ; another will be sent you in a few days. Should the place be besieged, it will soon be relieved.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief -

WASHINGTON,, D. C., June 15, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

Don't give General Milroy any command at Harper's Ferry ; we have had enough of that sort of military genius. If you have not already done so, send all your small posts and available troops there; that place must be held 0000.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief
