LAKE CITY, FLA., June 7, 1863.

Colonel HUGH ARCHER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Tallahassee, Fla.:

COLONEL: I am instructed by the general commanding to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 5th instant, inclosing one from His Excellency Governor Milton, whose expression of confidence in the general commanding is not highly appreciated by the later. He regrets not having had His Excellency's company on the pleasant trip to Jacksonville, a position which he considers should be held and fortified. He will make an application to the War Department for two or there rifled 32-pounders so soon as he shall have arrived at Charleston. He recommends meanwhile that Governor Milton and the Florida delegation should make another application to Mr. Mallory for a like number of Brooke 32-pounder guns. About six pieces of that caliber are required at that important point to command the navigation of the Saint John's and guard the lower portion of East Florida.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. N. TOUTANT BEAUREGARD,

Aide-de-Camp.
