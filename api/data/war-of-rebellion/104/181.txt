HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, THIRTEENTH ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel CHRISTENSEN,Asst. Adjt. General, Army and Division of West Mississippi:

Major Blackman returned at 3.30 this p. m., having been ten miles up the road toward Bay Minette Station, but has heard nothing of General Steele. The guide, McGill, thinks he must come by Bay Minette Station, and that he has been detained by the difficult and circuitous road from Stockton to that point. Lieutenant-Colonel Thornburgh left here at 4 p. m. to go to Bay Minette Station; thence to General Steele. He promises to send me a courier to-night. Lieutenant Knowles, of the scouts, is here, and I will detain him till I get some reliable information of General Steele's command. I send Major Blackman's command to you for forage, and hope that he may be able to return to me early to-morrow. If the major-general commanding the army deems it advisable, I can unload my train here in camp and send it back for another load of supplies.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES C. VEATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
