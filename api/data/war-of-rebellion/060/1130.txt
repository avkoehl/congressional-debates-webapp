cattle, hogs, and sheep in the border counties of Kentucky, which it is thought may be procured. I have directed Colonel Ferguson, of the Sixteenth Virginia Cavalry, who was in Wayne County on the 13th instant with his regiment, to procure all the information he can as to where cattle, hogs, &amp;c., may be procured and the parctricability of bringing them within our lines. I suggested to the War Department last winter that cattle, &c., might be procured form Kentucky by private individuals living in that State, if the Government would pay for them in Virginia or the funds current in that State, but, so far as I know, the attempt was not made. I think it very important that the attempt should be made now. I have conversed with graziers who have for years been purchasing cattle in East Kentucky, and they express great confidence that Kentuckians themselves would deliver a large number or cattle, hogs, sheep, &c., to us in Virginia if they were assured of being paid in Virginia funds at 5 or 6 cents per pound gross. I think the experiment worth trying, and it may be if you will recommend the experiment. The stock of sheep in this section of country is represented as unusually large, and I believe the stock of pork will be much larger than is generally supposed. Any information I may get on this subject which will be of interest to you I will communicate with pleasure.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA, Dublin, January 29, 1864.

General S. COOPER,Adjt. and Insp. General, C. S. Army, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I think it important that there should be an officer in the immediate command of that part of Virginia embraced in the Department of East Tennessee and designated as the District of Southwestern Virginia. Brigadier-General Preston having been relieved from command of that district, I ordered Brigadier General W. E. Jones, whose brigade was in that section of country, to assume the command, reporting direct to me.

Paragraph XXVII, Special Orders, Numbers 19, fo the 23rd instant, From your office, announces Lieutenant-General Longstreet as the commander of the Department of East Tennessee, but does not seem to embrace Southwestern Virginia, and the Secretary of War told me that he did not regard that district as under General Longstreet's command. Your order attaching that district to my command not having been revoked, I have thought it incumbent on me to continue to exercise control there.

Brgiadier-General Jones informs me by letter, received this morning, that General Longstreet had ordered his brigade into East Tennessee. I have though it proper to inform you of the order i gave Brigadier-General Jones, in order that if not approved it may be at once corrected, and to ask whether I am to continue to exercise control of the District of Southwestern Virginia. May I ask of you an early answer?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
