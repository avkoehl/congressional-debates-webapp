IUKA, October 23, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

One of my aides is just back from the front. All well to-day. Plenty of forage at the front. The forces encountered yesterday were Lee's cavalry, two brigades, and the only reason why we lost some officers and men was that one of our advance regiments mistook the enemy for our own people on account of their having some of our blue overcoats. Railroad beyond Cane Creek doubtless badly destroyed. I can use it up to Eastport and now need only a steamer. I keep a regiment at Eastport to advise me of an arrival. I send one of my aides to the bridge this afternoon to report progress, but I calculate the bridge being done by Sunday night.

Major-General.

(Same to Dodge.

CORINTH, October 23, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

I heard from Spencer three days out. All right. I hope Sherman's advance will draw their attention from him. Sherman has lost about 40 killed and wounded skirmishing. Colonel Torrence, Thirtieth Iowa, killed. Have sent a man to Jackson. Did not know we had troops there. Where is McPherson?

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

CORINTH, October 23, 1863.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Falkner, who went with Lee, has crossed Tennessee at Tuscumbia and at Swallow Bluff, and is now between here and Jackson, no doubt to break up the railroad to Columbus and stop the repairs. Five hundred of Lee's cavalry passed down the Tuscumbia and Cotton-gin road three nights ago. No doubt were going to replace the force that left Okolona.

Chalmers is at Water Valley, repairing damages, building railroad, &amp;c. Do not hear of McPherson. Fuller will be at Chewalla to-night.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON,

Commanding Seventeenth Corps, Vicksburg:

I inclose your letter from Dodge.* Wheeler's entire cavalry has been driven south of the Tennessee, say 8,000, and are now cut off by the rise of the river from Middle Tennessee. They are annoying
