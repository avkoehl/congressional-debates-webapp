MEN OF Texas, TO ARMS!

Colonel James P. Major, late of the Second Cavalry, who distinguished himself in the great Wichita Indian fight under Van Dorn, and at the battle of Oak Hills under General McCulloch, has been commissioned by the Secretary of War to raise a regiment of lancers. This is favorite service with Texas and a splendid field for military achievement. The undersigned has been commissioned by Colonel Major to raise a company for his regiment. Each man is expected to furnish a good horse and substantial clothing for the campaign. The company will be furnished with transportation to the place of rendezvous at Fort Smith, Ark., at which place they will be furnished with regiment. Soldiers enlisting in this service will be entitled to $50 bounty. All who can procure a six-shooter will do well to secure one, as it is a terrible instrument of execution in the hand of the Texan.

Fellow Texans, now is the time to rally to the standard of liberty. The enemy are pressing us on every hand. Our hearthstones and sacred firesides are polluted by the tyrant's minions, and the cry of "To Arms!" "To arms!" ring along the hills and valleys of the sunny South, calling in thunder tones the denizens of the forest to roll back the red wave of war upon the shores of the heaven-cursed land of the Northern barbarian. Let the motto of "Victory or death!" be nailed to our flag. Let thee valiant sons of Texas rally from the hill-tops and the valleys, like Highland Scots to the bugle blast of the bold McGregor's horn, and a more terrible retribution will follow than ever was recorded on the burning PAGEs of history. Those wishing to enlist will report to me forthwith at Victoria.

GENTLEMEN: I am in receipt of your favor of January 29, by the Economist, and desire to express to you the deep sense of obligation felt by this Government for the kind and generous confidence which you have exhibited toward us at a moment when all others in foreign countries seem to be doubtful, timorous, and wavering. You will find, however, that your confidence was not misplaced, and that we have not failed (as far as we could find means) to make remittances to Captain Huse, although not as rapidly as we desired; but our difficulties have bene great in procuring secure remittances. Enough, however, has been done, we trust, to relieve you from embarrassment or apprehension. I find from my books that the amounts furnished to Captain Huse have been recently as follows, viz:
