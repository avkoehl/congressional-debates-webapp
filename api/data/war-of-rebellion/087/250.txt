On the morning of the 16th General Miles, with his brigade and the cavalry under General Gregg, made a reconnaissance up the Charles City road to White's Tavern. General Miles reached a point within half a mile of White's Tavern when the enemy attacked in force, and, the object of the movement having been attained, he withdrew to the right of the Tenth Corps, Major-General Birney. The Fourth Brigade, Lieutenant-Colonel Broady, was also sent to assist the Tenth Corps. on the morning of the 17th General Barlow was obliged by illness to go to the hospital at City Point, and the command of the division devolved upon me. I found the division disposed as follows: The First and Fourth Brigades in position on the right of the Tenth Corps, on the Central road, about two miles from its junction with the New Market road, and the consolidated Second and Third Brigades and the Fourth New York Artillery massed on the New Market road opposite that junction. A picket-line of about two miles was held by the division. About 5 p. m. the troops on the New Market road were hurried to the line of the Tenth Corps, the enemy having made a demonstration. They were not, however, called into action, and returned to their former position before dark. On the morning of the 18th the First Brigade was withdrawn and the entire division deployed along the New Market road, where a line of entrenchments was thrown up and the timber in the front slashed. This position was held until the evening of the 20th, when the troops recrossed the James and Appomattox Rivers, arriving in the old camp, near the Deserted House, early in the morning of the 21st.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Division.
