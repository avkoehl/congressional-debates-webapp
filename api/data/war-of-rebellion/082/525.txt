house is very near the railroad itself, about four miles and a half southwest from the Jones house. General Meade thinks the enemy have mistaken the direction of the route of General Hancock, and are preparing to meet a raid on the railroad, but that when he discovers his mistake he may endeavor to push in our left. He has sent two brigades from the Ninth Corps to picket to your left and hold the entrenchments. I shall have two other brigades support you, if necessary. Have every thing in readiness to give the rebels a good reception if they pay us a visit.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.

General CRAWFORD:

More recent information renders it probable that there is no force of the enemy's infantry on the plank road, as reported.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

PICKET-LINE THIRD DIVISION,

July 27, 1864-2.10 p. m.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: The cavalry command has been changed within the last three days. McIntosh's brigade is now in our front, having replaced Alger's, and came on duty yesterday morning. Everything is quiet along my line. The enemy's patrols are moving as usual. It is possible that the new commander of the cavalry, not having been informed that there was infantry near the Gurley house when he came on duty, has made a special reports. Everything, however, is in readiness.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that nothing unusual occurred during the night with the exception of more than ordinary firing. We suffered nothing to speak of.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 27, 1864-9.30 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I think it extremely probable the effect of Hancock's movement may produce an attempt on the part of the enemy to turn and attack our left
