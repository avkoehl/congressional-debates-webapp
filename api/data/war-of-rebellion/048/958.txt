HEADQUARTERS VALLEY DISTRICT,Shenandoah Mountain, December 13, 1863 - 7 p.m.

Colonel W. L. Jackson,

Commanding, &c., Warm Springs:

COLONEL: Averell and Mulligan encamped at Monterey last night. I expect them to attack me here today. I feel pretty confident I can defeat them. If I do they may attempt to turn my position by way of Williamsville or Warm Springs. In either case I think it important that you and I form a junction. If I defeat them here, or learn that they are moving toward Bath, I will move down that way. The route by Williamsville is the one they would be most likely to adopt as it is the shortest and the one by which they would get between us. I understand that you have some force at that place. I can spare none to go there at present.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel Jackson:

COLONEL: The courier from Back Creek has returned. He ran into the enemy's pickets, about 8 o'clock this morning, about 2 1/2 miles this side of Gatewood's. He did not see or hear anything of Captain Marshall. I saw one of his men, who said that he was certainly cut off.
