Upon this amount of exports, 86,396 hogsheads,
(after deducting the amount consumed in Gibraltar
and Malta, fjee ports,) costing in the United States
$6,450,620, Mr. Dodge estimates the revenue de-
rived in Europe to be $35,071,820, which estimate
is assumed by the then Secretary of the Treasury.
If" such was the revenue of 1837 or 1838 upon the
quantity that year exported, what must it have
been in 1845, upon almost twice the amount ex-
ported. The duty in every country of Europe is
specific, and port duties, and is the same, whether
the tobacco costs m this country five dollars or
fifty. The duty, then, the last year, according to
that ratio, upon 147,168 hogsheads, must have
been about $59,857,984; being an average of about
six hundred per cent, upon the cost of the article.
But sir, the duties range, as wijl be seen from the
tables and statistics herewith exhibited, from sev-
enty-five to near two thousand per cent, upon the
cost of the article in our ports, and furnishing a
commentary upon their theory of free trade, and
their professions for reciprocity.
And now, Mr. Chairman, compare the amount
of duties levied by this Government upon the im-
portations from Europe with the duties levied there
upon our tobacco, and what a contrast does it pre-
sent. The whole amount of imports in the year
last referred to, (1845,) was $117,254,564, and the
duties levied upon that amount was $26,653,809 36
net, not an average of twenty per cent.
And now, sir, without stopping to inquire from
whatcountries the particular items of goods, wares
and merchandise are imported upon which ourrev-
enueis levied, and without unnecessarily burdening
my argument with the specific amounts imported
from each of the countries of Europe, it is sufficient
to contrast the revenue levied in Europe upon this
staple, with that levied here upon all the imported
productions which we consume. The tables and
statistics here referred to, sufficiently show the dif-
ference and inequality, without publishing a fuller
illustration.
I And let it be borne m mind, too, that the tariff
| under which those duties in 1845 were levied, was
| intended to foster and protect the labor and industry
! of the country, and not for revenue alone; whereas
: the tariff policy of most of the Governments of
i Europe, operating upon the tobacco trade, is for
' revenue alone, and is intended to be at the highest
revenue point. Whether a greater amount would
be collected under a system of diminished duties,
is not for our consideration. I have no doubt that ;
the net revenue of Great Britain would be increased 1
by diminishing the duty on tobacco from three i
shillings to one, and that would be equivalent, at the |
present prices, to four hundred per cent.; whereas !
| the highest duty levied by this Government upon |
j any article from Great Britain, does not exceed *
i forty per cent, ad valorem. j
! All experience shows that there is a maximum I
! above which duties, imposed for revenue, fail in j
j their object; and in adjusting a tariff for revenue, !
I there must be discrimination. Where the duty !
operates upon foreign productions which come in j
competition with the productions of the country i
imposing the duty, high duties operate as protec-
tion; where they do not, they hold out an induce- ;
ment and premium for contraband trade.
Effect of a modification of duties upon our tobacco.
What would be the effect of the repeal of the
monopolies by the Governments of France, Aus- j
tria, and Great Britain, and the reduction of the
imposts and transit duties by the other European j
Governments upon our tobacco, to a standard ap- 1
proximating to the rate of duties which we levy
upon their productions when imported into this ;
country? It would, sir, increase the consumption !
fourfold; it would put this article, particularly ;
Maryland and Ohio tobacco, which is chiefly con- i
sumed in smoking, within the reach of the greater i
I; part of their population. They are now excluded j
ij from the use of it by the enormous price which, 1
|j by reason of the duties, it commands, and it is J
only used when mixed with the inferior product;
of their own country. An estimate was made by
Mr. Dodge, an intelligent agent sent by this Gov-
ernment to different parts of Europe to examine
into the state of the tobacco trade, by which he
shows that 422,344 hogsheads would be exported
to Europe and consumed there under a moderate
rate of duties. His reasoning is plausible, and the
conclusions may be correct; but if one-half the
amount estimated by him would be required, the
price would be relatively enhanced, and the plant-
er remunerated for his labor.
But it would have another important effect; it
would increase greatly the amount of the exports
of the country; would employ a greater amount of
shipping; would have an important and beneficial
influence upon foreign exchanges, and enable us to
importforeign goods at amuch cheaper rate. But it
has been charged that the price which the planter re-
ceives does not depend upon th$ duty levied on the
article. It would be strange ifit did not. The price
is affected in a double aspect: first, the high duties
must be paid upon that which is consumed which is
not contraband. This lessens the amount consumed
in every country, because it makes it a luxury too
expensive to be within reach of any except the op-
ulent, and causes almost all who consume it to mix
it with the inferior tobacco grown upon the conti-
nent. Thus a smaller quantity being required than
is imported, the imperative law of demand and sup-
ply applies to it, and so much more being produced
than is required under the high Government exac-
tions for those who are able to consume it, the
price must necessarily decline. And again, sir,
under the present duties, for instance in England
and Austria, the consumer has to pay so much to
the Government—the tax itself being from six to
fifteen times as much as it sells for here—there is
nothing left for the planter.
The principle that the duty upon an article is
paid by the consumer must be modified in its ap-
plication to the high taxes on tobacco. Although
paid by the consumer, it is, in some measure, the
planter's loss; for the tax is paid by withholding
from him a fair price for his commodity. The
duty of seventy-two cents in England a pound,
makes it cost the consumer eighty or ninety. The
Government must be paid. If the duty was 100
per cent, instead of the present high rate, the con-
sumer would obtain it at from twenty to twenty-
five cents a pound, and this would afford the planter
a better price than he now receives. The differ-
| ence, therefore, between twenty-five cents a pound
' and ninety cents is the planter's loss, supposing
the article always to sell at the present price in the
English market.
And now, sir, what has been done to remedy the
evilsunderwhich this interesthas been permitted to
labor from the commencement of rhe Government
to the present time? Much has been attempted, but
little accomplished. As early as 1785, Mr. Jeffer-
son, then representing this Government at the
Court of Prance, called the attention of that Gov-
ernment to their restrictions on this article of our
commerce,and remonstrated against the monopoly
of the trade by the Government. He succeeded
in obtaining a relaxation of the restrictions, and
for the next year the importation into France
amounted to thirty-five thousand hogsheads. The
restrictions were again increased, and the amount
of tobacco imported was reduced, and does not ex-
ceed eight thousand to ten thousand hogsheads.
It would be needless to travel over the whole
history of the negotiations upon this subject. It
would occupy more of the time of the House than
I would have a right to consume. It is known to
the country that this subject was one of deep and
absorbing: interest for many years. During the ad-
ministrations of General Jackson, Mr. Van Buren,
and Mr. Tyler, several agents were sent to Europe
to treat upon this branch of commerce, and our
Ministers to France, England, Prussia, and Bel-
gium, have been instructed to bring the subject to
the attention of the different Governments to which
they were accredited, and to urge upon them a re-
peal or modification of their heavy restrictions and
monopolies, A gentleman of my own State, who
had given great attention to this subject, was also
sent as a Minister to Austria, and charged particu-
larly with this branch of commerce. His inqui-
ries, as well as those of our agents, were minute
and particular; their efforts constant and unremit-
ted. The impolicy, the inequality, and injustice
