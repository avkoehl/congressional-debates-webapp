into operation for several >ears past, to arrest ths
financial opeiations of the Government, for
the purpose of forcing the people into the measures
of a banking corporation It was shamelessly
avowed by its organ, thai it was in vain to reason
with the people, and that they never would be
brought to thetr senses until they were brought to
them by severe distress. Sir, said Mr. B I believe
that the great object of that power has been, and
is, to produce that d.stress, for the purpose of bring-
ing the people, as they sav, to their senses, or, in
other words, to bring them bound hand and foot to
its footstool. This tnugniy moneyed power Ins
not onlv earned on its designs pgnnst the citi^ns
of the country in their pecunitrj and commercial
relations, but now ascends a step higher, and chres
to wresde with the Government of the people's
choice, striving to arrest its fiscal opeiatiems, for
the purpose of bringing the " stupid" people to
their senses Should that object ue accomplished,
then those political prophets who have been exult-
ing for j ears in the embarrassments they hav
thrown m the way of the Government, w ill trium-
phantly say " Your Government can only get on
by the aid of a Bank of the United Slates "
Mr B here t ok occasion to refer to the
course of the Federal party during the lat" war
with Great Britain, in availing themselves ol all the
means in their power to embarraos the operations
of the Government, and to bring ils arms and Hi
credit into disrepute, by lefusing necessity sup-
plies, which he likened to the couiae of the Oppo
sition at this time, reckless of the honor and inte-
rests of their countiy, and willing to sacrifice all
in the eager pursuit of political powei What
was the course of the Federalists, he asked, in that
war'' During its whole continuance ihcy were
constantly endeavonng to barrass the Government,
to cripple its resi urce--, discredit us arms, and to
bring it to propose an inglonc us p< ice , but
people, whom they now profess to be so anxious
to bring to their senses, were not quite so lost to
national honot as to sustain them, but, with patri-
otic devotion, they stood bv their country, as he
trusted and believed that they would now, and
that country came out of the contest with in-
creased strength and renovated glory. He could
not but admire the patriotic and noble senti-
ment which was utleied by one of our gal-
lant defenders daring that memorabk con-
test. "I am tor my countiy," said lie, "right
or wiong " He ha 1 no d fficulty in believ-
ing that there «as a s\stemdiic endeavor to pi<s-
trate the credit oí the countiy, in I to bung it n>
the feat of a great political paity and a git at mo-
neyed corporation, a  was then, by the same means,
attempted to bring it to the feet ol a lo eign power
In this postuie of afiaiis, he was, ¡ike the gallmt

What' this Government, ru her, and in bettet con-
dition in its fiscal resources, than anj Gc \ cinmeut on
earth, bankrupt' The idea, abluid and ndiculous
as it was, was calculated lo di grace us abroad It
wa« an msul!, not on t'w Administration, but on the
co mtiy at large—on the whole people ot the United
States To say that this Government, which butre-
represcnis the wealth and intelligence oí (he people of
the United States, and in which gieat concern they are
the stockholders, is bankrupt, «as an assault en the
national credit and character If the meiest petti-
fogger in the humblest county couit in the Union
were to get up and make the issertton, m a legal
argument, that the wealthiest citizen ot the county
was insolvent, because he could not piy eveiv dol-
lar he owed at a moment's warning, he -"unid be
scouted at He knew that honorable gentlemen,
who had read 'omethmg of the law-merchant in
Blaekstone's Commentaries, unl he statesmen of
enlarged and liberal views, enteavored to assimi-
late this Government to a bankrupt, technically
made so, by force of law But the merest pettifog-
ger in our courts would be scouted for drawing
such a parallel Ue had asserted that there was no
GoTernment in the world whose fiscal resources
w«re in so good a condition as those of the United
States. Let gentlemen look to England—one of
the freest Governments, in their estimation, in
Europe. That Government, so lauded by the Op-
position for its paper system and freedom, hid her
thousand millions of public debt, while we, who
merely contemplated a loan of only ten millions,
were taunted with being bankrupt If gentlemen
were disposed to go into figures and calculations,
let us see how matteis stood with the Admin stra-
tion which prsceded the late one, and which
wis expelled fiom power bv the people's voice.
The national debt, under that Administraron, was
fortj or fifty millions, though they did not create it
The national debt under this and the act of Octobei
could not exceed ten millions altogether, and if the
Government had its available means, it could at
once pay it off But the Government had been
deprived of its resources, by the votes of the very
gentlemen who now taunt it with bankruptcy, and
they were, therefore, bound, by e ery moral and
political principle, to provide for the deficiency In
the first place, they voted for the Distribution act,
with others, which was the principal cause which
oecas oned ihe pre ent wants of the Treasury. He
himsell had approved it, believing it to be
his duly to restore to the people what had
been tiken from them by unjust taxation,
but gentlemen m the Opposition voted for it, who
were governed by no such motives, for they had
fastened on the country that odious system of tax-
ation, by means of which the suiplus had accu
mulated Gentlemen m the Opposition also voted
with the tnends of the Admimstiation, to relieve
the merehants who were suffering under the effects
ot the explosion, by an extension of their duty
bonds, ihns placing thiee or foui millions moie out
oí tin Treasur},and by voting to íelieve the banks,
bv giving them along ciediton the Government
mom y they had so lawlessly detained, they placed
out ot the Treasury near six millions more Thus
erontlomi n, by whose votes near forty millions have
bet n put out oí the Trcasuiy, now contend that the
Gmeinmentis bankrupt1 Hecontended that every
mouil obligation, every principle of justice and pa-
triotism, demanded of these gentlemen to supply
the Government which thty had stripped of its re-
somrcs Th3 Senator írom South Carolina [Mr
Priston] askel why they did not establish a sys-
t' m oí direct taxation? ancruhy not call upon the
States 11 refund the money that had been deposited
with the mi It the gentleman was so solnious for
these measures, why did he not propose them him-
se If? Why not propose a measuie lor the appoint-
ment of a host oí oílicfis to collect the direct taxes?
Did not the gentleman piofe's the greatest reverence
and respect lot economy? And what e-onomy
ce uld there be in collecting ditect taxes' He be-
lteved that the ablest finane leisctimatedthat, by the
best mode that coul 1 be devised of colkctmg direct
taxes, the expense would not be less than 25 per
cent , while the experse of supplying the Treasury
m the mode proposed, would be veiy inconsidera-
ble Was the gentleman prepared lor calling on
the Stales for the meney deposited with them under
Ihe disinbution act, or was his project merely held
out ml captandumf It he was m earnest, Jet him
bung forward his propesition'!
Bui il s-emed tint the Senitot from Seuth Ca-
rol na [Mr Piustos] had made anew discovery
lie had discovered that the measure now proposed
was unconstitutional, that the Government had no
light to make use of its credit by an issue of Trea-
suiy notes. This he asseited in the face of the
long continued practice of the Government during
the l?st war, and m the very face of the Constitu-
tion itself, which gave Congress the power to bor-
low money, and the power to punish the counter-
feiting of the securities of the United States But
ue would give the gentleman, m answer to his ob-
jections, his own argument, and he wanted no bet-
ter for the purpose The gentleman strenuously
insisted that, if the Government was in want of
money, it should raise it by a loan, instead of by
the means provided m this bill which he deemed so
objectionable, and m the very next breath he told
ns that the «suing these Treasury notes would be
"a loan to all intents and purposes." Now, sir, said
Mr B if it is a loan to all intents and purposes,
that is a conclusive answer o the gentleman's ob-
jections.
It had often been asserted that there had been no
parallel to this case of the Government borrowing
money during a time of piofound peace Thw
was an error, like others us«d m the heat of argu-
ment, but it was easy, by historical reference, to
refute it. The Government, during the admims-
ration of Mr Monroe, called for a loan of five
millions, which was granted, and, as it was taken
by the Bank of the United States, it was doubtless
looked upon as a sound and judicious financial
measure, but now that the money wanted is to be
raised on the credit of the Government, independent
of the banks, it is looked upon as waste and extra-
vagance, and unconstitutional In reply to Mr.
Crittenden, Mr B denisd that the bill wculd
cause the issue of a greater amount of Treasury
notes than the ten millions authorized by the act
of October last, six millions of which have been
redeemed and cancelled, and, in point of fact, it
was a loan asked for by the Government to the
amount of ten millions, only to supply the place of
such of the notes issued under the act of October
last as have been, or shall be, taken in and can-
celled by the Government The debt, therefore,
wou'd not be increased beyond tnat sum to the
amount of a dollar by this act. The bill authorized
but a mere reissue of notes whtch was not autho-
rized by that act He had heard a great deal said
about the waste and extravagance of the Adminis-
tration, and he confessed that, with the knowledge
he possessed of the votes of the different political
parties m this body, he could not hear it without
some degree of astonishment. Who, he asked,
were constantly found voting for the most wild and
extravagant appropriations'? Surely gentlemen re-
membered to forget the his'ory of their own course
on these subjects, who now denounced the very
extravagance that they themselves had been mainly
instrumental in producing
Mr B said that the journals of both houkes of
Congress might be verv safely appealed to, as
showing that the opposition to President Jackson's
administration had almost uniformly favored a
profuse and extravagant expenditure of the public
money. When he had first taken his seat m that
body, which was at the first session of Congress
after the late Piesident came into office, he
had found the Opposition, which was mainly
composed of the old American S}stem party,
almost unid rmly urging and voting for the
most wasteful appropriations of the public money.
There was no system of pensioning, however great
the charge which it was likely to bring oa the
Treasury, that did not, in the mam, meet their fa-
vor and support There was no object of internal
lmpiovcment, however improper and unconstitu-
tional, that did not find from them a warm sympa-
thy and ready advocacy They were, in the main,
as a party, the supporters of the great project for
a national road from Buffalo to New Orleans, the
cost of which was estimated at from fifteen to
twenty millions of dollars It was this profuse
system of extiavagance which at that day found
so much favor with the Opposition, that led to the
memorable veto of Piesident Jackson, on the oc«a-
sion of the Mijsville road bill, at which time bills
were pending before Congress for various projects
of internal improvement, the estimated cost of
which was largely upwards of ene hundred mil-
lions, and which were mostly arrested by that me-
morable decision of the President, and the public
Treasury saved from a system of the most waste-
ful prodigality. Who did not recollect, at that
day, that the Administration of the late President
was charged with a ruinous and parsimonious poli-
cy in regard lo internal improvements? \nd why?
Because the policy of the American System party
required extravagant expenditures of the public
money to keep up and sustain their fai onte mea-
sure of high duties It was true, that when <<ome
surplus had began to accumulate in the Treasni y,
and a plan fordistribution among theStateshad been
lormsd, the language of economy had sometimes
been heard from that quarter It was a muah
more rapid and expeditious war of operating on pub
