His Excellency Governor, J. G. SHORTER, Montgomery:

General J. E. Wool declined to permit the appointement of a commissary of prisoners although we offered to receive one from the United States Government. He offered, however, to remit to individual prisoners what might be sent to them.

RICHMOND, May 23, 1862.

Major General BENJAMIN HUGER, Petersburg:

How many privateersmen are there? Are there any officers among them, and what is their grade? Did you propose any change in the adopted scale of equivalents?

Inform General J. E. Wool that Colonel A. M. Wood, who was paroled, was intended to be exchanged for Colonel George S. Patton, who was also on parole; that supposingthe exchange to have been made the Department ordered Colonel Patton on duty, but finding no record of it we desire now to relase Colonel Wood from his parole if it has not been done already.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

PETERSBURG, May 23, 1862.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

I have no answer to message of least evening. What time shall I notify General Wool that the exchange officers for privateersmen will reach here? His letter goes to you by train.

BENJ. HUGER.
