35th Cong....2d Sess. Protective and Free-Trade Tariffs Contrasted—Mr. Walton.
Ho. of Reps.
In the first low-tariff period of four years, we
bought nearly $166,000,000 more than we sold; in
the next seven high-tariff years, the balance was
reduced to less than $33,000,000; m the next five
low-tariff years it was increased to $90,000,000; in
the three following high-tariff years it was again
reduced to less than $7,000,000—making a differ-
ence in our favor, compared with the preceding five
low-tariff years, of more than §83,000,000; while
in the last low-tariff period of eleven years, the
balance against us was more than $338,000,000—
making a ditlerence against us, compared with
the preceding high-tariff term, of more than
$330,000,000. Comparing the average annual
excess of imports, it runs from a fraction over
$2,000,000, to less than $5>000,000, under the
high tariffs, and from $18,000,000 to more than
$40,000,000, under the low tarifls.
These figures are sufficiently expressive. As
we raise our duties and encourage home produc-
tion, the balance against us goes doivn; while, as
we reduce the duties and encourage foreign pro-
ductions, the balance against us goes up, until it
reaches a point beyond our means of immediate
liquidation, and then come the crash of business
and the wreck of hearts and hopes. So much as
to the excesses m the importation and consump-
tion cf foreign goods.
Now, with the purpose of seeing how the for-
eign debt has been increased, let us find the bal-
ance of our imports and exports entire—including
specie

In the opening low-tariff period of four years,
the balance against us is £>165,000,000; the next
seven hi^h-U\riff years reduce it to less than
§39,000,000; the next low-tariff five years increase
it to more than §140,000,000; the next three years
of high tariff again reduce it to $8,000,000, making a
difference in our favor of more than $130,000,000;
while m the next and last eleven low-tariff years,
the balance against us is once moie increased to
neiu!y $34,000,000, and that, too, notwithstand-
ing an enormous export of £314,240,176 of specie
iii these eleven years.
Mr. Chairman, I have been seeking for the
causes of the terrible convulsions that luve peri-
odically crushed the country; and here, 1 submit,
is the chief cau^e—the most potent or ail causes
—in these monstrous excesses ot importations
overexpoits. These make an enormous foreign
debt which has to be paid, and paid with interest;
an important item that fmdo no placc in the an-
nual tables of imports and exports. And this debt
(for 1 am speaking of balances only, after deduct-
ing exports) has to be dischaured in specic. Thus,
to meet the balance of imports against us in the
last eleven years, we withdrew from the capital
of the country and exported abroad "3314,240,176.
Why, sir, the entire coinage of this Government
from 1703 to 1858, was only £>051,639,089 78; and
here is nearly one half of that sum withdi awn ft otn
the capital of the country m the last eleven years;
and $184,159,158, or more than one quarter of the
entire coinage, has been withdrawn and exported
from the countiy m the lest four years! This
enormous drain of $314,000,000 m specic stili ieit
a debt of $23,040,714 for foreign goods consumed
above all our domestic exports m the same period,
and left, also the unpaid interest, whatever it may
be, upon our total foreign debt, which is now es-
timated at no less a sum than $500,000,000. Here,
1 again say, :n this enormous dram of cash capi-
tal, springing directly from excessive imports of
foungn goods,* is the great cause of " convul-
sions. "
1 come now to the effect of high and low du-
ties, respectively, upon expenditure and revenue,
(meaning revenue from customs alone,) exclud-
ing the period fioin 1815 to Ibid entirely, and the

I find that the openin
an annual average expenditure of less than
£13,000,000, excluding payments on the public
debt; the succeeding low-tariff period, $27,500,000
—expenses more than doubled ! The succeeding
high tariff reduces the average from $27,500,000
to $23,000,000;and then the nextand present low-
tariff period runs up the amount from #23,000,000
to £48,300,000—more than doubled again ! Tak-
ing all expenditures, including payments on the
public debt, we start with a high tariff, and an
annual average expenditure of $25,000,000; the
next low tariff gives us £30,000,000 within a frac-
tion; the next high tariff gives us a large fraction
over $30,000.000—due exclusively to larger pay-
ments on the public debt, as the table shows; and
the succeeding loiv tariff runs up the sum from
$30,500,000 toalmost$G0,000,000—nearly doubled
again. As to revenue: the amount from customs
alone, in ihe high-tariff periods, is always in ex-
cess of exn< ndituies, excluding the public d< bt,
varying from about $4,000,000 to $9,275,000;
while the low-tariff puiiods vary from an excess
of more than $1,600,0(10 to a deficiency of more
than $10,300,000. Including payments on the
public debt—tluU is, all expenses—the high-tariff
deficiencies run from less than $3,000,000 to
$3,780,000; while the low-tariff deficiencies run
from $9,G00,000 to $12,600,000. Thus the high-
tariff tendency is to moderate expenses, and mod-
erate variations in revenue; while the low-tariff
tends to excessive expenses, and large deficien-
cies, which, at last, find legitimate results in a
bankruntTreasury and an accretion of the public
debt.
To show this, I will give the deficiency in the
revenue (from all sources except loans) to meet
all expenses*, and also the amount borrowed m the
labt year ot each penod:

h No convulsion.
The low tariff year 1818,gave a "convulsion,"
with a deficiency of $13,500,000, and the Govern-
ment a borrower to a small amount. High tariff,
1831, reduced the deficiency from $13,500,000 to
$1,500,000; there was no convulsion, and the
Govcj nment was not a hot rower. The year 1838,
with a low tariff, ran up the deficiency to more
than $13,000,000; there was a terrible 46 convul-
sion, " and the Government was a borrower to
ne.u-ly the amount of the deficiency. The year
ending June 30. 184G, under the ln h tariff of
3842, gave an excess of revenue of $2,000,1)00;
the Government was not a borrower, and there
was no convulsion; while the year 1858, which
closed a long low-taiiff term, found the Govern-
ment a borrower to the amount of $23,000,000,
and with a deficiency of £35,000,000, and the
country "crushed" by on* of the most terrible
" convulsions" that lias ever occurred.
Now, sir, what arc the ^reat facts shown by
all these details from the official tables? in all
the petiods when we have stimulated foreign pro-
ductions and repressed domercic by j low Uuili',
we have hod excef&ive impoit?, excessive foreign
debts, excessive mileti'vs of paper currency, and
excessive expenses of the Governnn nt; and, as
the sum of them ail, a " convulsion," bankrupt-
ingthe Government, and Ucrushing"the business
of the country. In both periods, when we have
encouraged domestic production and diseouraged
foreign, by a high tariff, we have had modeiate
imports, moderate foreign debts, moderate bank-
ing, moderate expenses of the Government; and,
as the results, a Government strong in means and
credit, and the country exempt from those ruinous
" convulsions" that have attended every period
in which the opposite policy prevailed. Tnere is
one exception to be noticed by and by, which
does but confirm the rule. Why this striking
uniformity in details and results, all marking the
protective and the anti-protective policies, as
surely as the mercury in the thermometer marks
the alternations of heat and cold ? Why? unless
it is that the revenue system, which favors foreign
countries, is ruin to our own; and the revenue
system, which favors our own, is its chief de-
fense.
These, I submit, are fair, palpable, and unde-
niable conclusions from the whole mass of facts
presented. But, consider the last two periods,
1844-46 and 1848-58, more in detail. In the pro-
tective period of 1844-46, the balance between for-
eign goodsconsumed and domestic exports was all
butoven Compared with the preceeding low-tar-
iff term, banking capital was reduced $53,500,000,
and loans and discounts $133,000,000. The ex-
penses of Government were reduced thirty-five per
cent, per head of population. There was a small
excess in the ordinary revenue, and the Govern-
ment paid $21,000,000 more than it borrowed;
and, finally, the country, throughout the entire
period, experienced neither a " convulsion" nor
evenasinglespasm. The immediately succeeding
anti-protective period, ending with 1858, stimu-
lated foreign imports to a balance against domestic
exports of $338,000,000; withdrew $314,000,000
of specie from our real capital; and at the same
time run up our corporate banking capital more
than eighty-eight million, and bank loans and
discounts $210,000,000; increased the expenses
of Government sixty-three per cent, per head of
population; and then came the "convulsion, "pros-
trating the business of the country, and bonding
your Government to Jew and Gentile for many
years to come.
Why this mighty difference — this mortal
plunge from wealth to bankruptcy—from vigor-
ous strength to weakness—from rosy health to
<kconvulsions?" " From an inflated currency,"
says the President. I say most respectfully to
the President, no. The inflation of banking cap-
ital was less than one third the inflation of mi-
ports, and less than one third, also, of the solid
specie exported. Even the inflation of loans
and discounts was but two thirds the excess of
imports and of the loss of specie. It is pass-
ing strange if the addition of $88,000,000 to our
banking capital, or $210,000,000 to our paper
money, has done this immense mischief, and the
$338,000,000 excessive imports and the loss of
$314,000,000 of gold and silver have done no mis-
chief at all! I submit it to the President and to
everybody else, to deny if they will, that the loss
of $534,000,000 of specie, and a balance against
domestic products of $338,000,000 of imports,are,
infinitely, the most potent means of mischief.
Why, sir, blot out utterly your average line of
loan? and discounts, ($498,000,000,) and still the
country could far better lose every dollar of it
1 than the $314,000,000 of specie, which is the only
substantial basis for your banks. iNro, sir; you
must look for the prime cause of convulsions in
those excessive importations of foreign products
which your free trade policy stimulates. From
these come foreign debt; from debt, a drain of
capital; and then the collapse of your inflated
paper currency, and the universal bankruptcy of
Government and people, which you call a " con-
vulsion." This is my conclusion, and 1 appeal
to the facts for my defense.
! We have seen that excessive imports attended
I each of the low tariff periods, winch ended in so-
lvere convulsions." INow, I will add that we
: have had two other years of marked disturbance,
i and one of them occurred within, and at the cum-
! mcncement of a hijjh, but immediately following
| a low, tariff period. If this is an exception to the
I general high tariff rule, it is but another proof of
I the truth of the rule. 1 refer to the year 1825.
