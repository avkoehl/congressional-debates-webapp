APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June, 1838.
¿5th Cong---2nd Stss.
Independent Tre isuri/—Mr. Hunter.
H. of Reps.
pleasure Here is the gieat difference between tins
and the other plans which I have seen proposed for
collecting and keeping the public revenue This
bill takes from him these tremendous powers, while
the other;,, m effect, bestow them upon him It is
easily demonstrated that any plan which pro-
poses to collect the public dues m bans notes,
gives, in effect, to the banks the use of the
Government funds and credii, but the proposuion
has been so clearly demonstrated by oihers,
that I shall not now repeat the argument
If the banks are allowed to use the Govern-
ment credit and funds, it is easy to perceive
that the power oi regulating this use will, m effect,
rest with the Executive, and thus give him the
means of contro'lmg these banks The power of
selecting and aiscontmuing the banks as public
depositories, in most of the schemes, is directly
vested in the Executive And if the attempt were
to be made to place it with Congress, it would
be found in practice, that he in fact exercised it
Congress not being always in session, and being
an unwieldly body, charged with the consideration
of many and various subjects, would scarcely ever
enter into that examination of details which is ne-
cessary for ascertaining the condition of the banks
and their mode of performing their contracts This
would be entrusted generally to the Executive, and
the continuance of the favors tnjo} ed by the banks
would usually depend upon the course which he
might choose to pursue in relation to them It
would almost alwajs be so, for the Executive is at
the head of his own party, who usually constitute a
majority of Congress, and who would be generally
disposed to sustain him in such measures as w ould
enable him to control the banks, and maintain the
ascendancy of the party If he, thei, could regu-
late the use ot the Government credit by the banks,
the boon would be great enough to give him the
control over them—a control which would place
both their pationage and the currency at his dis-
posal Mr. Chairman, the patronage of the eight
hundred banks m this country every one can esti-
mate m some degree, it is known to be vast But
he natuie of the power of altering the standard of
value is one which is not perceived at the firs'
glance It requires some little reflection to com-
prehend its extent, and to perceive that it reaches
every citizen, and ail the property of the commu-
nity He, sir, who would fully measure its extent,
should turn to the example of England, whe<¡e his-
tory is, perhaps, iiio't mstruc'i\e to us than any
other Iflweie called noon to select the revolu-
tion which, of all others ¡,mce the Noiman conquest,
had effected the most radical change in the founda-
tions upon which that Government rests, I should
pass over at once the wars betw een the Roses,
whic-i always ended i" the mere substitution of one
king for another, I should pause but a moment upon
that contest which earned the first Charles to the
block, and raised a subject to his place, and pass'ng
over the Restoration, come at once to the period
at which William III was elected In making this
choice, I should not be governed by the precedent of
electing a monarch b) Parliament, or by most of those
changesm the orgamc law which are usually re-
ferred to as marking the extent of the revolution
The great, the leadingchange, which left the deep-
est impression upon tne institutions and destiny of
the country, was the establishment of the Bank of
England, ana its connection with the Government
This, together w th the funding sjstem, which «a«
the twm-s¡ster of the Bank, enab'ed tne Govern
ment to raise money almost at pleasure, and that
too without responsibility The poner over the
purse then changed hands, from the Commons to
the Bank, and through it to the Mimstty In com-
parison with this, all previous devices of Govern-
ments for debasing the com were clumsy and use-
less for the p irposes of power The money of the
world being the same, exchange soon told the secret
But the estable invent of this Bank, with its paper
money, enabled I he Government to altsr the
standaid oí value, b) means so secret and subtle,
thai after an experience of more than a century,
its people scarcely understand tnem as jet
The system soon devektped itself in its conse
quences Before that time England had achieved
much, in comparison with the rest of the world,
both in arts and arms, as she has done since She
had poured forth her hosts to redeem the holy se-
pulchre and moistened the sands of Palestine with
the blood of her nobles and yeomen, she had
marched her armies into the very heart of Prance,
and held a great portion of that kingdom by right
of conquest Under her Tudors she had main-
tained the balance of power in Europe and pro-
tected the Pretestant faith In short, she had laid
the foundations of her colonies, her commercial
system and her power long before the time of
William of Orange, and yet at that day she was
not burthened with a national debt A new era,
however, had now taken place As the first iruifs
of this system, the civil list ol William and the
revenue were swelled to more than double those of
any of her previous monarchs
But it was reserved for the younger Pitt to deve-
lope the tremendous power of the machinery trins-
mitted by William It was said of him by John
Randolph, that his dialectics had like to have cost
England her national existence Their pow er was
undoubtedly great, but they would never have en-
abled him to have overwhelmed her m eli bt, if it
had not been for the connection of the Bank of
England with the Government, fhrougn which he
changed the standard of value Fading dial his
expensive projects would cost him his place, even
with the aid of the I undmg system, if he called upon
the country for the means of executing them, he
caused a suspension of specie payments, and de-
based the currency Intelligent observers of the
time estimated the depreciation at fifty per cent
Prices rose, the people became contented at their
imaginary prosperity, little dreaming that their
Premier was borrowing money for them at an inte-
rest of one hundred per cent and leaving it to pos-
terity to pay the debt He increased the national
debt during his ministry to ¿£620,000,000* sterling,
for which it is almost certain the nation received
not more than half the value as a consideration,
and yet, upon the resumption of specie payments
in 1819, they assumed the obligation to pay the en-
tire amount by the specie standard Such are the
stupendous frauds to which Governments are invited
by their connection with banks Their alliance
is so tempting and convenient to power, that I be-
lieve nothing could ever have severed our own Go
vernment from the banks but that earthquake in
the credit sj stem which shook them apart Sir, if
time permitted, I ihmk I could refer to the history
of our own country for illustrations of the abuses
to which this connection is liable But he who con-
siders the nature of this power of altering the stan-
dard of value will not need illustrations to con-
vince him of the appalling danger of confiding it
to the Executive The question for our solemn con-
s deration is, shall we renew th s dangerous con-
nection? For one, I answer, never with my con-
sent
But gentlemen avoid the consideration of the
great pimciples presented by the bill, by raising
objections to the deta Is. They say that this bill
will increase the patronage of the Executive Per-
mit me fir a moment, Mr Chairman, to institute a
comparison of the Executn e patronage, with and
without this connection between Bank and Govern-
ment If )ou pass this bill, and sever the connec-
tion, you increase the number of office-holdeis bj
nine, and make an addition in the wax of salaries
by an amount something le-s than $25 000 This
is thp vhole patronage conferred by the bill
Without (he bill, however, and with the connec
tion, joj give the Executive the control cf eight
hundred banks, w ith a'l of their patronage, and
confer upon him besides the power of altering the
standard of value Can there be a doubt, then, but
that, upon this comparison, the balance should be
struck m favor of the bill?
I come, now, then, to a second objection wh ch
is made to this bill It is said that the public mo-
ney will not be so safe in the custody of the Go-
it is worthy ol lemailt that the interest upon the wl ole ad
diti n mide to the national debt of Fiance dtu t °- the entne
reign ot Ivapoleon up to 1814 and whiUtthit eon itn nal a
speeie cmrency amo mted only to £100 000 V i h aspecto

nod and yet she made only this email a Mm n to her ratio ia]
debt, an amount not to be compaiedwith thatcontracteduyber
great rival under the paper •system
vernment officers as it will be in the banks This
is a question which we have no means of deter-
mining with perfect certainty. Ii must at last be
settled by a calculation of probabilities. If
we are to confine ourselves to the single con-
sideration of the quantity lost by actual de-
fault in the custody of the different depositories,
the facts presented by the industrious reswaich
of the chairman of the Committee <rf "Wajs and
Means, would seem to establish the strong proba-
bility that the chances of loi s by actual default
were less when the funds were in the hands of the
public officers than when placed with the banks.
He has ascertained, (as appears by his report upon
the subject,) that the entire los? of public money
in the custody of public ufficers during forty-nine
years, is certainly not one quarter of one per cent,
and probably about one-tenth of one percent upon
the entire sum ivhich passed through their hands,
whilst the actual loss of public funds in the banks,
for a period of seventeen years onlv, is nearly
three-eighths of one per cen* upon *he amount de-
posited in them
I confess, sir, that this result was contrary to my
previous impressions, which were vague upon this
subject But in examining another matter, I
chanced upon a report made by a comrmt'ee of
this House in 1801, which seemed to confirm this
view of the case A committee, of which Mr
Otis was chairman, was charged with the examina-
tion into the losses of public revenne in the hands
of public officers The result was, that in six
years the entire loss of money received for customs
and lost by the default of these officers, was less
than one-seventh of one per cent, of the sum eol-
lected. It is to be remarked, too, that the period
to which the examinations of these two committees
were directed, was one during which there was no
personal penalty upon defaulting officers Should
this bill pass, which attaches the loss of liberty to this
offence in public officers, the chances for their
safe-keeping of these funds will be increased,
and the comparison will turn still more m
their favor But I beg leave to remind these
gentlemen that, under any system of custody,
the public revenues must twice pass ihrongli the
hands of public officers, first in collection, and
next m disbursement. I ask them to reflect, too,
that after all, it is a question of human agency, in
which they have to determine the relative fideli-
ty to their trust of two diffeient sets of agents,
the one chosen by Government, and punishable
in person as well as m property for a defau't, the
ofhei, selected by the banksi and not visited by
tnese personal penalties in case of the like offence.
If there be any candid mmd which, after these
consideiations, shall still decide that the chances
for safe-keeping are in favor of banks, I hazard
nothing in affirming- that it cannot suppose this
difference to be great. If so, I put it to that in-
dividual to say whether, for the trifling considera-
tion of a little greater loss of public money, he
would sacrifice the great advantage  which I have
endeavored to show would result from this divorce
between Bank and State. He could not hesitate;
and if he did, I would then demand that he
should conduct the whole inquiry upon which
this question of loss depends, and not a single
branch of it The true question is this Wil
the public loss be more by depositing its fund1
with its own ofiicers, or by placing them with ¡he
banks' In stating this account, we must introduce
more items against the bank than the loss by actual
deiault We must charge them with the loss by
the depreciation of the paper in which they pay,
and with the pecuniary loss sustained by the com-
munity m tne expansions and contraction of the
curiencj, which this deposit tends to increase and
produce When the account is thas- stated fairly,
I think a glance of the eje would determine that
there w as a large balance against the banks
I have thus endeavored to meet thlc objection
tauly But gentlemen must patdon me if 1 refuse
t j go into tne irrelevant issue which they have
raised for popular effect When they rise npon
this bill to clamor against the union oi the sword
And purse in the hands of the Executive, 1 must
take leav e to tell them that they speak to an wane
not made in the case.   Let them make their case,
