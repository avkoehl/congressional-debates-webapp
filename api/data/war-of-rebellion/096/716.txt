SIR: One hundred and fifty-four guerrillas, on Wednesday, the 22nd instant, near midnight, started from Little River near Smith's Point, Va., in several boats and crossed the bay, their destination Smith's Island, Eastern Shore, Md. Their object is to rob stores, capture and bring over the refugees and deserters who have gone there from Virginia, to capture a steamer and some pungies, and with these attack and destroy the light-vessels. They are led by Rice Airs, the murderer of Captain Duncan. I have notified Captain Hooker, and will keep a vigilant watch on the light-vessel until I receive further orders.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
