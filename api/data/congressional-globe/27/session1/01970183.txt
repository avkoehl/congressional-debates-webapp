who owed a large debt and had no spare means on
hand? Would it be proper, or at all excusable, m
such an individual, to borrow as much as would
double his indebtedness for the sake ef speculating
in bank stock? If it would not be proper or expe
dient in an individual, it would not be proper or-
expedient in th s or any other Government It is
proposed to take from the pockets of the individu-
als composing tn  community, the capital to be
borrowed by the Government, already alleged to
be in debt, and to invest it in this. Bank stock, in
which the people them=eives could put it if they
should think proper to do so, and if they had it to
spare over what they owed But it is said the pro-
fit will be so great as to justify that course Well,
then, with regard to the profit, let that be ex-
amined mto a little. The eight per cent divi-
dends of the late United States Bank were held
up as a tempta ion; but he (Mr W.) thought his
friend from Pennsylvania [Mr. Buchanan! had
shown pretty c early that instead of 8 per cent that
concern, on the winding up, hardly yielded an ave-
rage, for the whole term ot us charter, of six per
cent dividend And even that was when the bank-
ing capital ot the countrj, relative population and
every thing els* considered, was not one-third of
the amount it s at present Now, with a compe-
tition of bank capital three times greater than the
late Bank of the United States had to contend
against, what probability is there that the stock in
this new Bank shall exceed the five per cent inte-
rest which the Government will have to pay on the
loan proposed to be raised for purchasing stock'
Is not there a greater probability that the dividends
will be less than five per cent and that there will
be a loss on the Government stock' It seemed to
him (Mr Wright) that, on the score of profit,
there was any thing but encouragement to hasten
thismeasttie.
The next ground which he (Mr Wright) could
conceive possible, tor the partnership connection
between the Government and the corporation, is,
that if the Government Joes not become a share
ho'der to the amount of at least one third of the
capital, the rest oí the stock will never oe sub
scribed—that is, it is necessary to hold out to pri-
vate capitalists the laducement of the ciedit of the
Government being pledged, to tempt them to take
the stock Well, are the friends or the measure
ready to come foruaid and place the necessity of
the connection on that ground? If they are, let
them say so, but they will not do it But can
they deny the fact that the partnership of the Go-
vernment is to be used for the purpose of lending
its credit to the institution, and that upon the faith
of that credit the stock is to be subscribea' It is
urged, as the whole power is in the hand-. if the
stockholders, that 1* a Bank cannot be framed
here, which tb^y will approve, there will be no
Bank at all, and private capiUhsis will not sub-
scribe unles-. tif Government takes ore third of
the stock Is not the inference ¡"¡disputable that
the cedit of t e Government is te be the tempta-
tion to private capitalists' Now the necessity for
this temptation was coiclusive evidence that the
speculation is in itself, bad—that the whole pro-
ject is bad.
The third ground, which he (Mr Wright) d d
not know had been urged, but which, prob-bly,
might be taken, in favor of tne connection, by that
portion of the trading community which deals most
largely m banks, was, that 'he partnership thus
formed would give to the mstttu'ion the influence
and the in erest o the Government. No doubt it
would be hough i thai on that account it would be
desirable the Government should take a much
larger share in the stock
On hese points it was his (Mi Wright s) opi-
nion, and he was sure that of the Inends with
whom he act d, that under any CDnceivable
circumstances it tmil 1 not b« desirable to connect
the money and th" credit of the Government with
any ins ítution to gne it a credit that would sus
tarn it in 'he eyes or tne people if it could not sus-
tain itself in the public estimation without the aid
of that borrowed credit If the institution cannot
sustain itself by its capital and its good conduct, it
is not proper that the credit of the Government
should be used  to  keep up a rotten and bankrupt
corporation.
Mr CLAY said he wa? quite unwell, and there-
fore hoped the Senator fn m New York would ex
cuse him for making a short reply to his remarks
The object of the bill was to furnish a sound na
tional currency, but, if profit was the considera-
tion, let it be fairly seen how that jeally stood If
the stock of the late United States Bank only
yielded five and a quarter per cent there was, be-
sides, a premium of sixteen per cent on selling it
out at the expiration of the charter, and there was
the bonus of a million and a half to the Govern-
ment Well, then, if there werp no other benefit
from the new Bank but what would amount to a
qnarter per cent more than the ínteres paid for
the capital subscribed, and sixteen per cert for
premium, and a million and a htt'f of bonus, it
would be doing pretty well It wou d be more
than could be gamed from the Sub-Treasury How
much had been lost since the time of the late
United States Bank, by the transpoitation of specie,
and by the operations of the Sub-Treasury' What
was the loss by the pet bank system? A million cf
dollars. All this would bs saved, if no hing else
was gained. Would the Senator trom New York
rise in the face of the country and say there was
more security in the Sub-Treasury and the sub-
treasurers, the Isaac Hills, the John Dses, and
Richard Roe^, than m such a Bank as this?
Mr   WRIGHT,  (from  his seat)     I do say
it, sir.
Mr CLAY could not express the ineffable as-
tonishment with which be heard that respectable
Senator say so The respect he had for the S"na
tor, and the decorum due to the Senate, forbade
him to say he did not believe it, but hi musí again
express his utter astonishment, that the Senator,wuh
the knowledge he must have ot the f, ct of a 1 the
Swartwoutmgs peculations, and deifications which
had taken piare und°r the late Admin istrat on
could bring himself to r; ak= mat decla-at on It
was to him (Mr Clay) a most extraordinary
evidence of the blindness of party miatuation, that
one possessed ot so much intelligence, aid usually
of candoi, snoulJ, in vipw of all the fids, enter-
tain such sentiment H  \ ouU repeat, that 1 e
had heard, with the most ineffable feeling of sur-
prise, the ut erance of such a sen'iment
The Government gets the diffcrenc oetween tht
interest paid fir the moni y subscribe 1, and thp di
vidends. Does n t the Senate r ner^eive, that no
thing is taken from the people, unless tht dividend
falls short of the interest and then the loss i« a tax
on the people' But were there not other advan
tages besides profit—the lacih íes of foiugn inter-
course m trade—oavmgs m e , tnse of transporta-
tion—stability rf the cuirency, &c Was nothing
to be allowed for increase i s'cunry, and the proba-
bility of making as much, ¡1 not more, than the
piofits of the old Um'ed Sats Bin1?, and its con
tinuance under the recharter, with a i th i npreve

He (ould not help regarding the opposition to
this bill as one eminently calculated to delay the
public business, with no other object that he conld
see than that of protracting to ihe last moment the
measures for which this session had been expressly
called to give to the people    This, too, was at a
ume when the whole country is crying out man
agony of distress for measures of relief. Does
the Senatt r believe it practicable, or within the
i contempla ion of the majority, to propose a bill, or
that it could be passed, or a Bank formed for the
management of the public funds, m which the Go-
vernment was to have no interest? What then
was the uce—and he would put it to the candor and
consideration of the Senator himself—what was the
use of urging such amendments as only served to
protract disensión and kill time, without any hope
of practical results'
This was now the third week in which the Se-
nate had been engaged in the discussion of this bill
I the same proportion of time is lost in the other
House, considering the proportionate number of its
members, instead of getting through the business
of this extra session in July, it will be the last of
autumn before it can be done. He would urge
upon the gentlemen opposite some consideration
for the just expectations of the country and of the
majority, and not pursue a course that would lead
to an inference that embarrassment and delay
were the objects aimed at.
Mr WRIGHT said, he did not mean to con-
sume more time than he judged necessary for the
honest discharge of his duty to his constituents arid
to the whole country So much he hoped he
would be permitted to do without feeling under
any necessity of restraint on account of incurring
the severe displeasuie of the Senator from Ken-
tucky He (Mr Weight) did not know till now
that the opinions which he had been repeating
over and over in this chamber, for the last three
years, were at last new to the Senator, or that Ihe
expression of them on this very appropriate coca-
s' on should exeite so much of his ineffable sur-
prise
But if, atter toe three years' expeu°nce just past,
he (Mr. Wright) ¡should express ineffable sur-
prise and ?stomshment at unding the Senator from
Kentucky sianding up onthisfloir and advocat-
ing such a measure as this, that Senator ought at
least to allow him to do s© without impu mg to him
any th ng ve>y irrational. Indeee., after the expe-
nence of these ihree year , not alone as to the real
< haracter of th  banking system, but also as to the
diwn of light and truth which the reinstatement of
the old con titutional mode of safe k epmg the
public money had shed, 1 e (Mr Weight) thought
it ou^ht not to excite the ineffable surprise and as-
tonishment of the Senator from Kentucky that he
(\Ir Wbicbt) andhisfnerd did prefer the Sub
Treasury to ihe partnership preponuon of the new
Banit and tie Government Th Sena or sat s look
at Swartwout' I say look at the President and
officers of the late Bank cf the Uttued States. And
as to the defaulter, bt could not see that tbey
suffered much in lie contrast with the bank
directors, ca'hi ^, an 1 tel ers Agents are but

Tne honorab'e Senator asks, as if triumphantly,
wi 1 nothing b" granted to experience' On ¡hat
scare much will be granted—the every day experi-
ence of the working of the bank system from one
end ot t íe Uní n to the oiner—the experience re-
corded m every newspaper trom ci íes, towns, and
hamlets, of absconding b m officers, plundered
bink coffer*-, and duped and suindied stockholders
Was nb j stem ever Ulfso bad as ¡t is at the very
mi meat this measure is advocated here m the face
of all these facts, and this lest of exper er.ee' This
is me expe íe ice which is to teach us that the part-
re ship ot tne Government with •  Bank corpora-
tion, is to be safer than the Ir-dependent Treasury
it was to be hoped, then, that with «uch evidence,
the honorable Senator would cease viewing wi'h m-
effahle surprise the oppns tion which h-, (Mr
Weight,) considered it to be his duty to offer to
this bill
Mr CALHOUN was not surprised at the impa-
tience of the Senator from Kentucky, though he was
at his attributing to this side of the chamber the
