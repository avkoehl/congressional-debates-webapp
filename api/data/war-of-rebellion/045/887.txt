GREENVILLE, N. C., June 13, 1863.

Major-General HILL,

Comdg. Dept. of N. C. and S. Va., Petersburg, Va.:

GENERAL: Foster left Washington on Wednesday last, going, as was supposed, to New Berne. He had been in Washington several days.

I cannot get information sufficiently accurate to be worth relying on.

Very truly, yours,

J. G. MARTIN,

Brigadier-General.

[P. S.]-The telegraph office at Rocky Mount is not in working order. I should receive telegrams as soon, if not sooner, from Kinston. Please let me know as soon as any decision is reached about Griffin`s regiment going away. If it stays, I wish to make some changes in its posts.

RICHMOND, VA., June 13, 1863.

Major General D. H. HILL, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: Thanks for your telegram, just received. I agree with you in your judgment that the Chickahominy is too long a line for our means. We can only defend certain points. The exterior line of defenses (inside the Chickahominy) would require 100, 000 men. I have Wise`s brigade at Chaffin`s, the force you sent of Ransom`s at Drewry`s, and Cooke`s brigade in reserve for support. Cavalry I need very much. Write me, if you please, and what you think of the enemy`s movement.

Very respectfully,

ARNOLD ELZEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, June 14, 1863-11. 30 p. m.

Major General JOHN B. HOOD,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that you move your command as early as you can to-morrow for Winchester.

Your troops will take the road by which you marched here from Winchester last fall. Such wagons as you may not require with you will be sent round by Woodville.

The general desires to know the earliest hour at which you will move.

Colonel Corley has some five or six wagons which he will let you have on application.

Colonel Cole has a day`s rations of hard bread, which you can send for also.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[G. MOXLEY SORREL,]

Assistant Adjutant-General.
