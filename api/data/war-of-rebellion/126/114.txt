NOTE.-I am quite sure that some recruits for colored regiments were not, as the regulations direct, reported to the chief mustering officers of the States, and therefore some do not appear on this exhibit. To correct this I have directed the chief of the Bureau for Colored Troops to report direct to you the number mustered. Should his number exceed those herein, the excess should be added to my totals. I have omitted from this the musters from rebel States, as they will be furnished in the report above referred to.
