Major-General BURNSIDE, Warrenton Junction:

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The number of wagons you now have is all that can be supplied. If they are insufficient for what you have to take, send back your surplus in the morning. It is not designed to haul anything but rations, forage, ordnance and medical stores.

MAY 3, 1864.

General BURNSIDE:

Colonel Marshall says that he has twenty-two wagons for 4,000 men, and that he needs ten more. Has received an order for marching. Colonel Raulston, of the [Twenty-fourth] New York Cavalry, says that his men's feet are in a very bad condition for marching with cavalry boots, and that they will scarcely be equal to much of a march to-morrow. His men have no knapsacks in which to carry the other three days' rations to make up the six on the person. General Willcox would like to know if the Eighth Michigan (guarding railroad bridge) are to go with him. He would like to have McCabe ordered to guide him.

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
