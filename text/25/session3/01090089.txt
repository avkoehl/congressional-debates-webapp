THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

at all times competent for the Senate to sustain.
It was like a motion for adjournment or for re-
committal, which could be made at any stage of
a proceeding
Mi McKEAN then asked for the yeas and
nays on the motion to lay the question of recep-
tion on the table, which were accordingly oidered
Mr NORVELL said that the decision of the
Chan, that the motion to lay the question of re-
ception on the table, even after the yeas and nays
had been oidered on that question, was undoubt-
edly coirert A motion to lay any subject on the
table was always the fiist privileged motion, ex-
cept that of adjournment But he desired to say
that the petition under consideration embiaced
two propositions, neither of which was before the
Senate. It remonstrated against the admission of
any State into the Union heieafter the constitu-
tion of which sanctioned slavery No Territory
or State was now, or likely to be at this session,
before Congress, or the Senate, asking for admis-
sion The memorial remonstiated against the
annexation of Texas, with slavery, to this Union
It was well known that Texas had withdrawn
her application foi annexation It was not prob-
able that it would ever beienewed by Texas, and
he presumed that none of us here had any dispo-
sition to renew it for her In voting, theiefore,
to lay the question of reception on the table, his
object was simply to dispense, for the piesent,
with the consideiation of subjects which were not
before the Senate, and not likely to come before
it for a long time.
The question was then taken, and decided in
the affirmative, as follows-

Mr McKEAN presented a petition from sun-
dry women of Delaware county, Pennsylvania,
praying that Congiess would so rt gulite the com-
merce between the seveial States as to abolish
the sale and transfer of slaves from one State to

make m the charter oí said city
Mr MERRICK said that the chaitei would
soon expne by its own limitation, and Congress
have power to revoke or amend it m any form
they may think pioper Theie is consideiable
dissatisfaction as to the inequality of the distnbu-
tion of powei in the present charter, as a great
change has taken place m the condition of the
city since it was incoiporated, and a very laige
portion of the population of the city is not repte-
sented m the coiporation He made these íe
marks for the purpose of attiacting the attention
of those inteiested, and he hoped that the citi-
zens might attend before the committee, and pie
sent their views on the subject He hoped there
would be no objection to its reference to the
Committee on the District, wheie the subject
would receive the proper investigation
The resolution was then adopted

HOUSE Or REPRESENTATIVES.
Thursday, January 3,1839
Mr WILLIAMS, of Kentucky, said they had
now been in session a month and passed but one
bill, and he supposed it was entirely unnecessary
foi the committees to assemble any more, as they
1 ad already more business on the Calendar than
they could act upon, and, believing that, he asked
leave to offer a íesolution providing that, in fu-
I tuie, until otherwise oidered, the House should
meet at 11 o'clock, a m. instead of 12, m
|     Objection being made, Mi   "W   moved a sus-
j pension of the rules, and called for the yeas and

Cambruiisjc's resolution for a select committee
to investigan the defalcations of Samuel Swart-
wout [Cues of " No1 no1"] Mr M therefore

the yeas and nays, so that (he said) it might be
1 seen who wis m favoi and who was against the
investigation

i wou'd suffer the morning business to go regulaily
on, that s,ubjtct would be icached sooner than by
