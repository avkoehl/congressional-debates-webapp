slaves hare been held and respected, have de-
scended and been transferíed, as lawful and indis-
putable property They were tieated as piopeity
in the very British example which is so Uiumph-
antly appealed to as worthy of our imitation
Although the West India plantéis had no voice
in the united Paihament of the Butish Isles , an
irresistible sense of justice extorted fiom that
Legislatuie the grant of £20,000,000 steilmg to
compensate the colonists for their loss of piop-
jerty
If, therefore, these ultra Abolitionists are sen-
pusly deteimined to pursue then scheme of im-
mediate abolition, they should at once set about
raising a fund of ¿1,200,000,000, to indemify the
owneis of slave pioperty And,the taxes to íaise
that enoimous amount can only be justly as-
sessed upon themselves or upon the fiee States,
if they can peisuade them to assent to such an
assessment, for it would be a mockery of all jus-
tice, and an outrage against all equity, to levy
any portion of the tax upon the slave States to
pay foi ¿heir own unquestioned propeity.
If the consideiations to which I have aheady
advcited aie not sufficient to dissuade the Aboli-
tionists fiom further peiseverance in then designs,
the inteiest of the very cause which they piofess
to espouse ought to check then caieei Instead
of advancing by their effoits that cause, they have
thiovvn back for half acentuiy the piospect of any
species of emancipation of the Afncan iace,grad
ual oi immediate, in any of the States Ihey
have done more they have increased the rigois
of legislation against slaves in most, if not all, of
the slave States Foity years ago, the question
was agitated in the State of Kentucky of a giad-
ual emancipation of the slaves within its limits
By giadual emancipation, I mean that slow but
gate and cautious liberation of slaves which was
first adopted in Pennsylvania at the instance of
Di Tiaiiklin, in the yeai 1780, and according to
which the generation in being woie to lemain in
slavery, but all then oflspung, boin aft< i a spe
cihed day, were to be fiee at the age ot twenty-
eight, and, in the mean time, weie to leceive pie-
paiatoiy instruction to qualify them tor the
enjoyment of ficcdom 1 hat was tin, species of
emancipation which, at the epoth to which I al-
lude, was discussed in Kentucky Wo one was
rash enough to pioposc, to think, of immediate
abolition No one was lash enough to think of
throwing loose upon the community, ignorant and
unprepared, the untutond slav* s of the State
Many thought, and I amongst them, that, as each
of the slaveStateshada light exclusively to judge
for itself in respect to the institution of domestic
slaveiy, the pioportion of slaves compand with
the white population in that State, at that time,
was so inconsiderable, that a system of giadual
emancipation might have been safely adopted,
without any hazaid to the security and inteiests
of the Commonwealth And I still think that the
question of such emancipation in the farming
¿tates i<i one whose solution depends upon the
relative numbers of the two races in any given
State If I had been a citizen of Pennsylvania
when Fiankhn's plan was adopted, I should have
voted for it, because, by no possibility could the
black lace e\er acqune the ascendency in that
State But if I had been then, or were now, a cit-
izen of any of the planting States—the southern
or southwestern Stites—I should have opposed,
and would continue to oppose, any scheme what-
ever of emancipation, giadual oi immediate, be
cause of the danger of an ultimate ascendency of
the black lace, or of a civil contest whic h might
terminate m the extinction of one race or the other
The proposition in Kentucky for a giadual
emancipation did not prevail, but it was sustained
by a large and respectable rmnoiity I hat minor-
ity had increased, and was increasing, until the
Abolitionists commenced then opeiations The
effecthas been to dissipate all prospects whatever,
for the present, of any scheme of gradual or
other emancipation Ihe people of that State
have become shocked and alarmed by these aboli-
tion movements,and the number who would now
favor a system even of gradual emancipation is
probably less than it was m the veais 1798-99
At the session of the Legislature held m 18J7-J8,
the question of calling a convention was submitted
tp the consideration of the people by a law passed
in conformity with the constitution of the State
Many motives existed for the passage of the law,
and among them that of emancipation had its
influence. When the question was passed upon
by the people at their last annual election, only
about one fourth of the whole votéis of the Slate
suppoited a call of a convention The appre-
hension of the danger of abolition was the lead-
ing consideration among the people foi opposing
the call But foi that, but foi the agitation of the
ques ion of abolition m a State whose population
had no light, in the opinion of the people of
Kentucky, to ínterfeie in the matter, the vote foi
a convention would have been much laigei, if it
had not been carued. I felt myself constiained
to take immediate, bold, and decided giound
against it
Pnoi to the agitation of this subject of aboli-
tion, theie was a piogiessive melioi ition in the
condition of the slaves throughout all the slave
States In some of them schools of mstiucuon
weie opened by humane and religious peisons
These are all now chtcked, and a spun of in-
subordination having shown itself in some local-
ities, traceable, it is believed, to abolition move-
ments and exertions,the legislative authouty has
found it expedient to infuse liesh vigoi into the
police and laws which legulate the conduct of the
slaves
And now, Mi Piesident, if it were possible to
oveicome the insuimountable obstacles which he
in the way of immediate abolition, lot us buefly
contemplate some of the consequences which
would inevitably ensue One of thtsi has been
occasionally alluded to in the progiess of these
retnaiks It is the stiuggle winch would instan-
taneously arise between the two laces in most of
the southern and southwestern States And what
a dieadful struggle would it not be ' Embittered
by all the lecolleetions of the past, by the uncon-
querable piejudices which would pievail between
the two laces, and stimulated by all the hopes
and feais of the future, it would be a contest in
which the exteimination of the blacks, or their
ascendency over the whites, would be the solo
alternative Prior to the conclusion, or during
the piogtess of such a contest, vast numbers,
probably, of the black race would migiate into
the fiee States, and what effcet would such a
mtgiation have upon the labonng classes in those
States'
Now the distubution of labor in the United
States is geogiapbical, the free laboiers occupy
ing one side of the line, and the slave Kboiers
the other, each class pursuing its own avocations
almost altogether unmixed with the othei. But,
on the supposition of immediate abolition, the
black class migiating into the free States, would
entei into competition with the white class, di-
minishing the wages of their labor, and augment-
ing the haidships of their condition
This is not all The Abolitionists strenuously
oppose all separation of the twoiaces I confess
to you, sir, that I have seen with legrct, guef,
and astonishment, their lesolute opposition to the
project of colonization No scheme was ever pre
sented to the acceptance of man, which, whether
it be entnely practicable or not, is charactenzed
by more unmixed humanity and benevolence than
that of tianspoiting, with then own consent, the
fiee people of color in the United States to the
land of then ancestois It has the poweiful íec
ommendation that whatever it does is good, and
if it effects nothing, it inflicts no one evil oi mis-
chief upon any poition of oui society Thcie
is no necessiry hostility between the objects of
colonization and abolition Colonization deals
only with the fiee man of color, and that with
his own fiee voluntary consent It has nothing
to do with slavery It disturbs no man's prop-
eity, seeks to impair no powei in the slave States,
nor to attnbute iny to the Geneial Government
All its action and all its ways and means are vol
untary, depending upon the blessing of Provi-
dence, which hitherto hasgiiciously smiled upon
it And yet, beneficent and haimless as colom
zition is, no portion of the people of the United
States denounces it with so much peiseveung
zeal and such unmixed bitterness as do the Abo-
litionists
I hey put themselves in direct opposition to
any separation whatever between the two races.
They would keep them forever pent up together
withm the same limits, peipetuating their ani-
mosities, and constantly endangering the peace of
the co-mmumty     They pioelaim, indeed, that
color is nothing; that the óigame and chaiac-
tenstic differences between the two races ought
to be entirely overlooked and disregarded, and,
elevating themselves to a sublime but mipiacti-
cable philosophy, they would teach lis to eiadicate
all the repugnance of our natuie, and to take to
j our bosoms and our boaids the black man as we
I do the i/l ito, on the same footing of equal social
, condition    Do they not perceive that m thus con-
' founding all the distinctions which God himself
| has made, they anaisn the wisdom and goodness
of Providence  itself    It  has been  His  divine
pleasuie to make the black man black and the
1 white  man white, and to d stmguish  them by
other constitutional diffeiences     It is not «eces-
saiy for me to maintain, nor shall I eniieavoi to
prove, that it was any pait of His divine inten-
tion that the one race should be held m perpetual
bondage  by the  othei, but this I will say, that
those  whom  he   his cieited different, nnd   has
deel ired, by their physical stuntnie and colni,
ought to be kept asundei, should not be biought
togethei byanypioee3S whatevei  of unnatuial
am ilgamuion
But if the dangeis of the civil contest which I
have supprsed  could  bo avoided, sepiration oi
trmlgamation is the only peaceful alteiuitive, if
it weie possible to effectuate the project of aboli-
tion     The Abolitionists oppose all colonization,
| and   it  nrtsistibly  follows, whatever they may
| piotest or decían , that tin y aie in favm of amaf-
[gimuion     And   who aie   to   bung  about  thu
amalgamation '    I have heard of none of these
. ultra Abolitionists furnishing in then own fami-
lies or persons examples of lnteimainage   Who
' is to begin it'    Is it their puipose  not only to
eieate a pinching competition between black labor
and white laboi, but do they intend also to con-
taminate the mdustiious and labonous classes of
society at the North by a levoltmg admixture of
the black element'
It is frequently asked what is to become of the
Afncan lace among us' Aie they foiever to re-
main in bondage' That question was asked
moie than hall a centuiy ago It has been an-
sweied by fifty yeais of prosperity but little
checkered from this cause It will be lepeated fifty
oi a bundled veais hence The tiue answer is,
that the sime Piovidence who has hitherto guided
ind governed us, and aveited nil serious evils
from the existing relation between the two races,
will guide and govern oui postenty Sufficient
to the day is the evil theieof We have hitherto,
with that blessing, taken tare of out selves Pos-
terity will find the means of its own pieservation
and piospeiity It is only in the mostdnefuf
event which can be'ill this people that this gieat
lnlt rest, and all other ot our gieatest interests,
would be put m jeopardy Although in paiticu-
1 ii districts the black population is gaining on the
the white, it only constitutes one fifth of the whole
population of the United States And in taki ig
the aggiegates of the two races, the Eutopcan is-
constantly, though slowly, gaming upon the
African portion This fact is demonstiated by
the penodical returns of oui population Let us
cease, then, to indulge in gloomy forebodings
about the impenetiable futuie But ii we may
attempt to lift the vail, and contemplate what lies
beyond it, I, too, have ventured on a speculative
theory, with which I will not now trouble you,
but which has been published to the woild Ac-
eoiding to that, in the progiess of time, some one
bundled and fifty or two hundred years hence,
but few vestiges of the black race will remain
among our posterity
Mr President, at the period of the formation of
our Constitution, and afteiwaids, oui patriotic
ancestois apprehended danger to the Union from
two causes One was the Alleghany mounfuns,
dividing the waters which flow into the Atlantic
ocean from those which found their outlet in the
! Gulf of Mexico They seemed to present a nat
I ural separation Thatdanger has vanished before
the noble achievements of the spirit of internal
impiovement, and the immortal genius of Fulton
And now nowheie is found a more loyal attach-
ment to the Union than among those very western
