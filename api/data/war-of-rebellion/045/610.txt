Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The blockade at Frederick is raised. Everything now works smoothly. I am on my way to Harrisburg, to open the Cumberland Valley Railroad, which is now very necessary for army operations.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Send to General Meade the New York regiments en route, and everything else you can spare.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 8, 1863-10 a. m.

(Received 12 m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Scouts sent yesterday by Colonel Pierce to Clear Spring, west of Williamsport, report Imboden at the latter place, with 7, 000 men and sixteen pieces of artillery, guarding 5, 000 wagons [sic], using every means of transportation. Up to noon yesterday, he had crossed but few wagons and 20 men at a time. General French, after considerable cannonading and cavalry skirmishing, failed in his attempt to reach Imboden. Potomac still rising, rains being heavy in all that region up to Hancock. If General Kelley could send a force to the Clear Spring country, it would be of service to General Meade, as the army may attempt to cross the river west of Williamsport.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

WASHINGTON, July 8, 1863-1 p. m.

General LORENZO THOMAS:

Your suggestion of orders to General Kelley was anticipated several days ago. He cannot be far from that point now.

H. W. HALLECK.
