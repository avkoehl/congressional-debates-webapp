call op this house.

here. I move that there be a call of the House.
The motion was agreed toâ€”ayes 33, noes 31.
So a call of the House was ordered.

relief from disabilities.
Mr. STOKES, by unanimous consent, intro-
duced abill (H. R. No. 2100) for the relief of
Charles A. Frazer, of Harrison county, Texas,
and Joseph H. Sloss, of Colbert county, State
of Alabama, of all political disabilities; which
was read a first and second time.
The question was upon ordering the bill to
be engrossed and read a third time.
Mr. STOKES. The bill is simply to correct
an error. These men have had their disabil-
ities removed, but in the Texas case Upshur
county was put in place of Harrison county,
and in the other case Colbert county, Tennes-
see, was put in in place of Colbert county,
Alabama.
The bill, which was read, provides for re-
moving all political disabilities imposed by the
provisions of the fourteenth article of amend-
ments to the Constitution of the United States
upon Charles A. Frazer, of Harrison county,
Texas, and Joseph H. Sloss, of Colbert county,
Alabama, for participation in the late rebellion.
The bill was then ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time; and being engrossed,
it was accordingly read the third time, and
passed.
Mr. STOKES moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on tho
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
