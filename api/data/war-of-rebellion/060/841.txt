CUMBERLAND, April 11, 1864.

Brigadier-General AVERELL:

The guerrillas attacked and drove in our pickets last night at Paw Paw and other points on the railroad, and patrol was attacked at Michael's Gap, 2 1/2 miles above the mouth of the Cacapon. Please send out as soon as possible a scouting party in their rear to scout the country between the Cacapon and South Branch of the Potomac. I will send a force from Springfield, Va.

Respectfully,

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.

MARTINSBURG, April 11, 1864.

Major General J. STAHEL,

Chief of Cavalry:

The Cacapon is impassable and I think Back Creek is not fordable. Will send party out. Everything quiet up the valley.

Brigadier-General AVERELL:

It is reported that a force of 150 rebels is between Sleepy Creek and the Great Cacapon. Send with the least possible delay 100 cavalry to Sir John's Run by railroad to scout the whole country between Sleepy Creek and the Great Cacapon. They will then remain at Bath until further orders and keep communication with the infantry at Sir John's Run and Hancock.

Back Creek was found fordable and a scouting party of 60 men were sent toward Bloomery Gap, four hours ago. It will take until morning to send 100 cavalry to Sir John's Run.
