COLONEL: The major-general commanding is desirous of ascertaining whether the enemy's occupation of Palatka is designed only to be of a temporary character, or whether he intends holding it. To this end he directs that in the next reconnaissance made there special endeavor be made to discover whether he is erecting any permanent works or merely temporary defenses.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

No important change reported from Florida. General Gilmer telegraphs from Savannah: "Cavalry guarding Ogeechee, Isle of Hope, and other points in this vicinity, must not move until replaced by others." I have informed him order must be obeyed regardless of consequences. I have no other available cavalry to send him.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
