The pest-hospital consists of six barracks, each 129 by 22 by 12 feet in dimensions and calculated for 53 beds, giving a total of 324 beds, which may in an emergency be increased for a short time to 420, the ventilation of the wards being very perfect. To guard, however, against the necessity of overcrowding the wards I have requested Captain Reynolds, depot quartermaster, to procure twenty hospital tents, to be used if necessary. Everyman now suffering from the disease has been removed from the prison inclosure, and every possible precaution is being taken to prevent the spread of the contagion. It is only to-day, however, that I have succeeded in getting every case of smallpox out of the prison yard, the pest-hospital being just completed. Ten prison barracks are still occupied for hospital purposes. they are in tolerably good order and the sick are doing well. The prison hospital is well under way, and I am promised that in six weeks, or about the time of my return visit, it shall be ready for occupation. It should be ready before that time, and would be were it not for the difficulty of obtaining lumber. Within the prison inclosure the necessity of a sufficient system of drainage and privies is even more evident than at my former visit. By my direction portable sink-boxes are being prepared for use until a better system is adopted. The old excavated sinks are already a nuisance. Accompanying this I send a copy of Captain Reynolds' letter to the Quartermaster-General relative tot he proposed plan of water supply and sewerage. For several days during the past week the entire camp has had to depend on the artiest an well pump for its supply of water, the supply pipe from the river having thoroughly whitewashed. The streets are being slowly policed. In fact, everything is being done slowly. I find it almost impossible to infuse any degree of energy of action into any of the officers with whom I have to deal. Colonel Johnson appears to possess a sufficiency himself, but does not impart it to his subordinates. In this connection, colonel, if it does not exceed my duty, allow me most respectfully to suggest that Colonel Kincaid, Thirty-seventh Iowa Volunteers, be under no circumstances placed in command of this post. He is altogether too slow and easy, and his officers and men appear to have no idea of the value of discipline.

In view of the possible extension of the prison barracks, I have, in company with the commandant, selected a new burying-ground on the south side of the island and some distance east of the pest-hospital. The present grave-yard is very injudiciously located within about 400 yards of the prison inclosure, due south, and occupying ground which
