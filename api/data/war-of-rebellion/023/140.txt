the cavalry having been ordered on other service. See that your command is well protected by outposts and that it is at all times prepared to march.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 13, 1862.

General NELSON, Athens:

Send two sections of artillery with Jackson's cavalry. Colonel Duffield, Crittenden, and Ninth Michigan reported captured at Murfreesborough. Colonel Lester and Hewett's battery held out at 3 o'clock. He will be re-enforced in time, I think. Try to reach the cars in the morning and look out for Franklin Bridge and Nashville.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 13, 1862.

General SMITH, Cowan, or on the road:

(Care of General Johnson.)

General Johnson will send another regiment in the morning to report to you. Use it and another regiment to re-enforce any point that requires it. They may be required at Wartrace, where there is a regiment. Communicate with Colonel Hambright there by means of a guard train. Colonel Walker's regiment is, I suppose, at Winchester to-night. Call him to the road. Colonel Matthews was ordered to return to Murfreesborough, but the orders may not have reached him; if so, he is probably at Shelbyville to-night. He had best

re-enforce Wartrace. Try with a hand car or couriers to communicate verbally with Murfreesborough,and if it is necessary and possible run re-enforcements to that point. That must be managed with prudence. Report as often as possible. Jackson's cavalry and a battery will reach Shelbyville, I think, to-morrow.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 13, 1862.

General SMITH, Stevenson:

Information has been received that Murfreesborough was attacked with some success by 2,500 cavalry at daylight this morning. Colonel Lester held out at 3 o'clock p.m. Other points may be in danger; if so, use the force within your reach to the best advantage. The security of the road is of vital importance to us. See that the guards are promptly and securely fortified with stockades. Be judicious and gain all the information you can. Jackson's cavalry, with artillery, will march for Fayetteville and Shelbyville or Tullahoma according to circumstances.

NASHVILLE, July 13, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Courier just in from Murfreesborough reports that our forces were surprised there at daylight this morning by Starnes with 2,500 men
