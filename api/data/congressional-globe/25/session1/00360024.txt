M, ADAMS said he had submitted the resolu-
tion .< r the purpose of obtaining the information
called tor in it, and he should wait until he saw
whe'her any otjections viere made to the resolution
before he made any remarks thereon
Mr HOWARD said, if the gentleman from
Massachusetts me< nt merely when the documents
came in to have it em printed, and notrerer them to
any committee of the House, he should make no
opposition to it It, however, it was the intention
of the gentleman to move to refer them to com-
mittees, for the purpose of taking up the time of U e
House, which should be devoted to other business
he should oppose it He hoped the Hon e would
not, by a silent vote, place ihelf m a situation from
which it would be difficult to evliicate itself He
could not now see the necessitv of printing
the correspondence called foi, as another motion
had interfered in the matter, but he presumed ti t
gentleman had son e food reason for calling foi it.
Mi AD4MS said it «as not his inter lion to
bring the subject before the House foi discussion
at the present time His intention was sirrpfy to
haie the information, and tohaie it printed foi the
mfoimntion of the House, and the information of
the nation He 'was willing that the question
should be taken at this time, and he should, "when
the second resolution came up, take occasion to
make some remarks thereon, and gne the íeasons
which induced him to call foi the correspondence
The resolution was then adopted
Mr ADAMS'S second lesolution, in the following
words, was then taken up
Rosoheil, That the President of the United Slat-s
be lequested to communicate to this House whether
any pioposition his been made on tht piit of the
Republic of Texas to the Government of tnc United
States, for the annexation of the said Republic of
Texas to thisfUmon, and if suah pioposition has
b*en made, what answer has been returned, and
all correspondence which has tiken place i elating
theieto
Ml WISE should vote against this lesolution,
for the leason that the correspondence was not un-
derstood to be in that condition at this time that it
should he made public, and in reference to the inte-
rests of the Republic of Texas its publication at this
time might be derogatory to them
Mr HAYNES diew the attention of the gentle-
man fiom Massachusetts to the fact that the reso-
lution did not contain the qualification or restric-
tion usual in calling ioi information from the
Executive If the gentleman would so modify it,
he would vote lm ii, otherv i«c, not
Mi ADAMS replied, that the leason wh}
he had not inserted the usual resine t ons w is,
tttat the call embraced in the resolution w ts
a simple question as to a maltei of ia< t, md
he did not, tor that reason, deem them ne-

proposition had been made to this Government,
which it wat, of public notoneU, the legislame
body of ihe Republic of Texas instructed their Ex-
ecutive should be made That, he lepeated, u as a
matter of public nofonetv, and the object oí this
inquiry was, to know whether that pioposition h id

another reason w as, that he cons deied the pi ->-
position itself as utterlv unconstitutional, as one

that .t was not at pitsert m a condition to lay
befoie the public, 0 f. 1 fiom being a reason vhy
the call should not be m-de, was an additional
reason for  the call    Since the existence of the
correspondence had been admitted, Mr A. de-
manded in the name, and as one of the representa-
tives, of the people of the United States, that they
should know what that correspondence was that was
to take away a part of their lights and bestow them
upon another whole nation Still, however, it it be
the opinion of the majority that the restriction
should be mtiodueed, it w as competent for any gen-
tleman to move it, and the House might do its
pleasure, b) adopting or lejecting such a proviso.
He himself was willing to take the resolution,even
v ith that íestnction upon it, because, of all things,
he desired, not only that that House, hut that the
whole people of the country, should know what
disposition was propose! to be made of their
rights
Mr HAINES then moved the usual proviso,
"pioi 1 led he (the President) deems it not mcompa-
t ble w ith the public interest "
Mi THOMPSON of South Carolina expressed
I is mten'Kn of voting for the amendment, but
aa-a nst the whole proposition, on the ground of its
having been prematurely brought before the con-
sielention of the House He had no intention, at
that time, of going over the topics adverted to by
the gentleman from Massachusetts, lor he felt con-
vinced that no good would result bj discussing the
■subject of Texas in its present very inchoate state.
He would, however, when the piopei time arrived,
be prepared to ieply to the gentleman, and would
connne himself th<_n by sajmg m advance, that he
differed with him on every ground.
Mi T thoi ght it piopei to add a single word 01
two It would be íemembered that, on a former
occasion, the gentleman fiom Massachusetts had
made some very important and honoiable explana-
tions, in reply to some remarks made bv Mi. T. as
to what occurred in relation to the Texan boundary,
while the distinguished gentleman was Secretary of
State It was then declared by the gentleman that
he had been himself opposed to the limitation, and
in favor of the tieaty to extend the boundary. But
no v, forsoota, they were told it was not in the
power of this Government to get back by treaty
that which the gentleman savs they could retain by
treat} Why it was a most monstrous doctrine,
tnat a Go% eminent can cede away, and not recover
back
Another aigument of the gentleman was not less
strange It seemed they weie not bound to take
the acts of the Executive of Texas, m relation to
foreign mattcis, as authentic Why, were they not
bound to take the acts of the Executives of all
foreign Governments chaiged with the treaty-mak-
ing power, without going into an examination of
the internal stiucture of those Governments1 In this
case, if the proposition had been made, it w as made
b} the authoi i7ed branch of the Government de-
puted with the fieaty-makmg power, though, even
if they were to look behind that, they would find it
to ha\e been do le 111 strict accordance with the will
of the people
The CHAIR lemmded the gen He man from South
Carolina, that it must be manifest the resolution
did not open so w icb a range oí debate as the gen-
tleman appealed to be indulging in
Mr TXÍOMPSOIN did not e'esign to go farther
into it than had been indulged 111 by the gentleman
from Massachusetts
Mi PICKENS merely arose to correct the
impression his colleague and otheis of his friends
seemed to be laboimg under as to the condition of
tne correspondence There was no objection
whntevei, at that time, to its being piesented to the
Amei can ptople and to the woild As a friend
t) th  cause oi Texas, he was h'mself willing that
1' should be presented, m order that, by the regular
session of Congi ess, the people generally, eu. well
as he members there, might make up their mmds

While up, Mi P wojld return his thanks to
the gentleman fiom Massachusetts for the position
he had assumed and for the candoi he had dis-
played He had taken hs ground in advance.
Mi P wasnot, how e\er, to be drawn into the issue
yet, for he would wait ioreients, but he wished
the attention of the House and the country t0 De
called to the very remarkable language of the gen-
tleman, and Mr P wished them to undeistand from
