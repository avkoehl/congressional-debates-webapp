PONY MOUNTAIN SIGNAL STATION,

November 24, 1863-6 p. m.

Captain NORTON,

Chief Signal Officer:

Excellent view of the enemy's position. His camps remain the same. No unusual stir about them. Horses grazing on the flats. Small working parties in the trenches opposite Morton's Ford. Infantry pickets extend lower down than heretofore observed. Thinning out of forsets discloses still more camps behind Morton's Ford, which now appear quite extensive. A park of artillery seen.

PONY MOUNTAIN SIGNAL STATION,

November 25, 1863-7 p. m.

Captain N[ORTON]:

All quiet. I see no change in enemy's position. About 200 men working to-day on fortifications behind Morton's Ford. See line of intrenchments little below the ford, apparently extending toward Mountain Run perpendicularly to the river. Gloskoski reports musketry firing, discharging of pieces in the cavalry division.

[29.] TAYLOR.
