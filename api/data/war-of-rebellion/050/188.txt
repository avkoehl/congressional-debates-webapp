Catlett, Dug, and Blue Bird in Pigeon Mountain, and then, taking great care to show camp fires and every other evidence that his forces remain in their camps in this valley, to march by night from Pigeon Mountain by taking the road which leads around its northern extremity and surprise the rebels at La Fayette. This road you will find laid down on the maps as Shields' Gap, but really it is no gap, but a complete cessation of the mountain. Everything will be completely ready for this movement by to-morrow night, and, should no new development prevent, it will then be executed.

Nothing heard from Burnside. It is exceedingly necessary that his cavalry should appear on that flank to prevent cavalry attacking trains.

CRAWFISH SPRING, September 16-3 p.m.

Though the Louisville and Nashville Railroad is paid by the Government for transportation at its own rates of charge, those rates being some 25 per cent. higher than are charged by other roads, it persists in preferring private freight over that of Government. It will be impossible to maintain this army without a complete change in the management of that road. The Government is its great customer, and should control its movements.

The excuse now made by the company is that some 50 of its cars have been taken for the Chattanooga road, but that is no reason why it should carry private freight rather than our supplies.

CRAWFISH SPRING, September 17-9 a.m.

The character of the roads here and the severity of the service, owing to the numerical superiority of the enemy's cavalry, use up horses very rapidly. Two thousand are now necessary to remount men whose animals are unserviceable. They can be procured in Nashville and in the region between here and there as cheaply and more promptly than elsewhere. It would be greatly for advantage of service if Lieutenant-Colonel Hodges, chief quartermaster of this department, could be authorized by General Stoneman to purchase. He can be relied on perfectly.
