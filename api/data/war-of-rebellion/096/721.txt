The following has just been received:

HDQRS. THIRD BRIGADE, FIRST DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS.

Major ROBERT A. HUTCHINS:

Three deserters in to-night. They say troops are being massed on their right, and a fight is expected shortly; that they are burning Government property, tobacco, and cotton daily; supplies come by South Side Railroad almost entirely; that the cars go away on both roads loaded. Citizens are moving out. Three pontoons across the river; one wagon bridge and one railroad bridge (the latter planked), about six feet across the river; recently bridges in good repair. That a third line of chevaux-de-frise is to be laid. Almost all the artillery gone, one heavy gun remaining near railroad; rest are light 12-pounders, and no rifles. A good many mortars, not very thick, on this front, but more to their right. The new battery is armed with two large two small mortars, Cutcheon's front.

Very respectfully,

G. P. ROBINSON,

Brevet Colonel, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

ROBT. B. POTTER,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 27, 1865-11.55 p.m.

Major-General POTTER:

The dispatch received is rather obscure. Do you mean that the deserters report that the rebels are massing on the left of your corps or on the left of the army?

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

On the right of the army, as I understand.

Brevet Major-General.
