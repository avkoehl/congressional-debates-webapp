HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,July 28, 1863-2.15 p. m.

Brigadier General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff, Nashville:

The Confederate officer who came to my lines is first lieutenant and assistant topographical engineer on Bragg's staff. He has valuable maps, and information of Chattanooga and country south and west of there. I am satisfied his information is reliable. Shall I send him, with his maps, to you at Nashville, or keep ho, here until the general commanding returns?

Major-General, Commanding.

WINCHESTER, July 28, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Colonel Laiboldt, at Stevenson, reports the enemy removing the remainder of the bridge over the Tennessee at Bridgeport. I have directed him to make a reconnaissance at 2 o'clock to-morrow morning, to ascertain the truth of this report. The remainder of the bridge might be saved by a permanent occupation of Bridgeport and the use of artillery. Should this be order, Bradley could be moved down, via Sweeden's Cove, in which case his position at the University should be occupied at once. The enemy crossed over yesterday, at Bridgeport, 150 infantry, on a small steamboat, to get lumber on this side.

Major-General.

WINCHESTER, July 28, 1863.

Major F. S. BOND, Aide-de-Camp:

I am in receipt of your dispatch about conductor. I arrested him because he was saucy and impertinent in language and manner. He will be sent up on the first train which is sent of Stevenson to supply the troops stationed there, a portion of which troops have been out of rations for two days, on account of failure on the part of the railroad to furnish the train ordered by the general and Colonel Taylor. The road is mots villainously managed; conductors dishonest and worthless. Conductor Rice charged Dr. Woodward, sent to Tullahoma a few days got to bring stores for wounded, $2.25 from Decherd to Tullahoma, distance 13 miles. Conductor arrested charged four or five sick men, sent by Colonel Laiboldt from Stevenson to hospital at Cowan, 75 cents each, although he was running only a detached engine, and would have put one off the cars had I not been aboard. The conductors are all of the style described, and I am forced to believe that the superintendent is of the same style also.
