On motion of Mr BRONSON, all the Territo-

Pursuant to the order, the House then, resolved
itself into Committee on the Union, Mr Sergeant
m the chair, and considered the following bills
1   A bill to establish two additional land office?
in that part of Wisconsin west of the Mississippi,
which was laid aside, and the bill from the Senate
on the same subject "was taken up m its stead, and
after being read, was laid aside, to be reported
2   The Senate bill to create the office of Sur-
veyor General in the Wisconsin Territory, was
next considered, with certain amendments, pro-
poseí by the Committee on the PudIic Lands
Tne bill was briefly opposed by Mr BOND,
and was supported by Mr JONES of Wisconsin,
Mr CASEY, Mr HARRISON, Mr. JOHNSON
of Louisiana, and Mr POPE
Af'er which, the amendments reported by the
committee were severally adopted
Mr BRI&GS offered an amendment, to insert
the words •' State of Illinois" in several places, so
that one office should answer for that State and the
Tern ory of Wisconsin also.
M' BRONSON, Mr LINCOLN, and Mr
MERCER opposed the amendment, and after some
explanation 'rom Mr BRIGGS, he withdrew it
Mr BO^vO then moved an amendment, tore
duce the saUi^ proposed in the bill from two thou-
sand to  twe've hundred dollars, which  was dis-
cussed, and modified to insert fifteen hundred, and
adopted by a vole of ayes 80, noes not counted
Mr CUSHMAN moved to amend so as to strike
out the contingent provision of twentj five hundred
dollars, and to inseitfor one draughtsman and clerk
a salary of one thousand dolla-s each
Mr BOND moved to amend the amendment, by
making it read seven hundred dollars each, which
was modified to lead an aggregate compensation
of sixteen hundred dollars , and having been ac-
cepted by Mr Cushman, the amendment as amend-
ed was adopted without a division.
Mr. CUSHMAN then moved to strike out the
proposed appropriation for house rent aad fuel,
three hundred and fifty dollars, which was rejected
—ayes 25, noes not counted
The bill was then laid aside to be reported
3   The bill to establish a new judicial district in
the Territory of Florida, was next considered, and
lsud aside to be reported.
4, The bill from the Senate to authorize the Pre-
sident of the United States to cause to be surveyed
and ascertained, the boundary line between the
State of Missouri and Territory of Wisconsin, with
an amendment to strike out all after the enacting
clause, and insert a bill with provisions to the
same end as the Senate bill, which amendment
was adopted, and laid aside to be reported.
5. The bill from the Senate to ascertain and de-
signate the boundary line between the State of
Michigan and the Territory of Wisconsin, was
taken into consideration, and laid aside to be re-
ported.
7 The bill to divide the Territory of Wisconsin,
and establish the Territorial Government of Iowa.
The bill having been read through,
Mr MASON of Ohio moved to strike out the
enacting clause, stating in a few remarks, that he
did not intend 'o commit himself against the b 11,
but it had been asserted that people had settled
there in a manner contrary to law, and in regard
to that and other topics he wished to obtain infor-
mation
Mr CRARY advocated the passage of the bill,
saying that there were a great nuny inhabitints
who were virtually without the protection of law,
and over whom the United Stales were bound to
extend the piotection of Government and law
He said Territorial Got ernmenuhad been provided
in formei years over sections of less extent, and
containing a much smaller m mber of people, and
he could see no reason why this case should be ex-
cepted from the general policy.
Mr MERCER made some remarks in opposi-
tion to the bill, and recommended that the bill
should be passed over for a time, as it would cause
debate, and would postpone or prevent the action
of the committee upon other bills which would
pass without debate, and which were important.
Mr. WADDY THOMPSON opposed the bill
and the creation of a Territorial Government in
the Northwest, and went at length into ja conside-
ration of the balance of power between the North-
ern and Western, and the Southern States, as far
as related to the questions of slavery, and the an-
nexation of Texas. He said he would never con-
sent to the coming in of these Territories or States
into the Union, when the fanatical spirit of the
North, was pouring into the House memorials
against the annexation of Texas, simply because
it was cursed with the peculiar institution of the
South
Mr BRONSON offered some suggestions m sup-
port of the bill, and referred to a large number of
actual settlers, who had acquired pre emption rights,
and would become citizens so soon as the lands
should be surveyed and opened for sale The com-
mittee had already passed upon two bills establish-
ing land offices in that Territory, ahd so soon as
they were prepared to a^t, there was a large tract
which would be immediately settled and paid for
But he would not agree to the principle, that peo-
ple should not be protected by Government, on the
ground that they had not bought and paid for Go-
vernment lands, when they had settled upon them,
and had acquired pre-emption right-, He also al-
luded to the vast extent of the Territory of Wis-
consin, and argued that as the whole was in the
course of settlement, it would soon be necessary to
establish the Government now proposed He ex-
pressed his pleasure at the candor with which Mr
Thompson had staled the ground? of objection
which he and some others might have to the bill
Mr B. said he would not go into a discussion of
the main point of that objection, but he would re-
fer to the ordinance reacting the Northwestern
Tomtoiy to 'how that the United States were
bourd to provide such Governments for Territo-
ries, and to admit new States when certain con-
tingencies arose, such as were described in that
ord nance He would not discuss the question of
the admission of Texas, but gentlemen would see
one strongpotnt of difference Tbts Terntory was
owned now by the United States It was theirs,
and they were bound to protect it Texas, on the
contrarj, was not ours, and would have to be ac-
quired. He trusted the friends of the bill would
not go into a discussion of the questions raised by
the gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr. Thomp-
son,] which, if entered, upon, would lead to an in-
terminable debate.
Mr. POPE followed with some arguments in fa-
vor of the bill. He went into a defence of the set-
tlers on these new lands, and spoke favorably of
their general character, and justified the practice of
squatting upon the lands, as m conformity with the
intention of the law, which was only made to pro-
hibit speculators from appropriating large tracts,
without actual settlement. He also advocated the
policy of erecting Territorial Governments, with
salutary laws and proper officers to administer
them. He spoke of the number of people on this
Territory, and said he understood they were more
numerous than, the people of Arkansas when a
Territorial Government was established there, the
population then being only about six thousand.
Mr BRONSON said there were now, as he was
informed, on-this Territory, west of the Mississippi,
thirty thousand people, and they were constantly
increasing
Mr. THOMPSON replied to the argument found-
ed upon the ordinance of 1787, and intimated that
he wished to meet the question of admitting new
States now, instead of xvaiting until it became a
Terntory with a hundred thousand people, and
knocked at the door for admission as a State He
wished to preserve a balance of power, and the
South desired the admission of Texas, that they
might have in the Senate a protecting power for
their institutions
The debate was continued by Messrs BRON-
SON, MERCEB, EVERETT, JONES of Wis-
consin, SHEPARD, and WHITE of Kentucky
The motion to strike out the enacting clause
was then rejected without a division
Mr BOND moved to amend the bill so as to
strike out two thousand dollars as salary for the
Governor, and fifteen hundred dollars as salary
for the same person as Superintendent of Indian
Affairs, and to insert twenty-five hundred dollars
for his salary in both these capacities
Mr BRONSON remarked that the salary as
fixed by the bill, was taken from other Territorial
acts, and was less than the salary in some of the
Territories He said there were Ind ans to be re-
moved from this Territory, and a great labor and
responsibility would be required from the Governor
m that service
Mr BOND spoke of his desire to reduce these
salaries generally, and thought the more this Ter-
ritory was subdivided, the more the salaries should
be reduced, as the labor and care would be less
He, also, compared this proposed salary with that
of the Governors in some of the States, and con-
tended that these were put too high in comparison
Mr EVERETT wished to have the salary for
each branch of the sei vice designated, so that, in
case different individuals should be employed, the
pioportions might be fixed for each
Mr BOND modified his motion according to
thie suggestion, so as to appropriate fifteen hun-
dred dollars as sa'ary for Governor, and one thou-
sand as salary for Superintendent of Indian Affairs
Mr POPE offered a few remarks, after which
the amendment was agreed to, and the bill was
laid aside to be reported
The bill from the Senate granting land to the
Terntory of Wisconsin, to open a canal to con-
nect the waters of Lake Michigan and Rock river,
was then taken up, with an amendment proposed
by the Committee on the Public Lands
Mr LINCOLN staled tre general principle, that
it is expedient for Governments, not only of the
United States, but of the separate States, to afford
facilities to corporations to carry on public works,
which will result in general benefit to the commu-
nit), and he was in favor of such action on the
part of the Government He said, however, that
this bill on its face appeared to give lands to the
Territory of Wisconsin, but such was not the fact
The hnd was given to a private corporation, ( he
Rock River Canal Company,) to remain private
property
Mr BRONSON explained, that the Territorial
Government desired to make the improvement, but
doubted the anlhonty of such a form of Govern-
ment to do so, and had therefore incorporated a
company to carry on the work, and in the act of in-
