COMMANDING OFFICER, FORT YUMA, CAL.:

SIR: The general commanding has instructed the chiefs of the quartermaster's and commissary departmen to send from Fort Yuma to Fort Mojave such supplies as they may deem necessary from the immediate wants of the force sent to reoccupy the latte post.

For fear that the troops under Captain Fithch may not have arrived at Mojave at the time of the arrival of the Colorado steamer it would be advisable to send a small detachment the command of a reliable and competent officer to guard the stores until the troops under Captain Fitch arrive. This detachment will return to your post on next tript of the stearmer. You will consult Captain Johnston, of the Colorado Steam Navigation Company, as to the necessity of sending the detachment; or if the captain does not arrive in time, consult the agent of this company at Youma. Whatever instructions may be sent by either Colonel Babbitt or Captain Kellogg will be carried into execution.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

It would be well, however, to remember that when the steamer starts on the 7th, 17the of each month you can (if you should happen to desire it) communicate with me in four days, though by mail it will be about seven in the summer time. The mail leaves Sacramento daily for Portland.
