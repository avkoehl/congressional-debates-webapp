portion of which passed Fort Monroe about noon to-day, to form a junction with Hunter, who must be at Harper's Ferry to-night, and for them to follow up in the enemy's rear. Taking all together everything looks favorable to me, but I want to avoid the possibility of Lee getting off with a great part of his force without taking advantage of it. I think you had better order Sheridan to get ready for service as soon as possible, but with the assurance that his troops will not until it is necessary.

Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

General Wright left at 10 a. m. His troops number 11,000. They are embarking rapidly. There are boats enough here now for 7,000. I expect more boats will arrive in time. General Wright's artillery and trains are left behind.

NEAR CHATTAHOOCHEE, July 10, 1864-6. 30 a. m.

(Received 2 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy this morning burned his bridges across the Chattahoochee, the railroad bridge included. If General Grant has nothing particular for Hunter, Crook, and Averell to do, and if they be in the Kanawha Valley, as is reported, they could be well employed by going to Abingdon, smashing up things in that quarter, and then going over in North Carolina.
