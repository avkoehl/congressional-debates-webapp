ations required for the different bands of

order of business.
Mr. SUMNER. I move that the Senate
now proceed to the consideration of executive
business.
Mr. RAMSEY. I hope we shall be allowed
to go through with the morning business.
Mr. SUMNER. That can be done after
wÂ© have finished what is to be transacted in
executive session.
Mr. RAMSEY. I trust we shall not go into
executive session now.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Before the question is
put on the motion of the Senator from Massa-
chusetts I ask leave to introduce a bill.
Mr. SUMNER. I make no objection to
that.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Then I ask leave to
introduce a bill without notice.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. By the
new rules that will require unanimous con-
sent. The order of business now comes within
the rule, so that any objection will prevent the
introduction of any business out of its order.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I ask unanimous con-
sent to introduce a bill.
Mr. CONKLING. I should like to suggest
to the Senator from Illinois that he does not
require unanimous consent for that any more
than unanimous consent is necessary for the
other motion. The new rule is that his bill
and all bills are received, among other things,
before anything else is done.
Mr. FESSENDEN. In their order.
Mr. CONKLING. In their order. I call
attention, if the Chair will allow me, to Rule
24, as we adopted it, which recites what shall
be done, and then declares " all which shall
be received and disposed in such order, unless
unanimous consent shall be otherwise given."
Now, I suppose, it is only in order by unani-
mous consent to move to go into executive
session.
Mr. SUMNER. I beg the Senator's pardon.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That is a
question on which the Chair entertains some
doubt. On the other question he has no
doubt.
Mr. SUMNER. A motion to adjourn is m
order at this moment, and so is a motion to
proceed to the consideration of executive
business.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If anybody objects to
my bill I will withdraw it; but I ask unani-
mous conscnt to introduce the bill.
Tho PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there
be no objection it will be received and read a
first time.
Mr. SHERMAN. If that is done the rules
will amount to nothing. I hope we shall begin
by observing the rules that we adopted yester-
day.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If the Senator objects
I cannot offer it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
being made, it cannot be received now under
the rules. Petitions and memorials are in
order.
petitions and memorials.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore presented a
resolution of the Legislature of Kentucky, pro-
testing against the action of the House of Rep-
resentatives in refusing to admit the Repre-
sentatives of that State into that body.
The Secretary proceeded to read the resolu-
tion.
Mr. HARLAN. I move that the further
reading be dispensed with, and that the com-
munication lie upon the table, and be printed.
Mr. SUMNER. From whom is the com-
munication ?
Mr. HARLAN. The Legislature of a State.
The motion was agreed to.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore also pre-
sented a memorial of the constitutional con-
vention of South Carolina, praying for the
removal of the civil disabilities imposed on
certain persons in that State by acts of Con-
gress ; which was referred to the Committee on
the Judiciary.
Mr. MORGAN presented a memorial of
merchants of the city of New York, asking that
the time in which claims for drawback may be

which was referred to the Committee on

reports of committees.
Mr. SHERMAN, from the Committee on
Finance, to whom was referred the bill (H. R.

nated for the use of Saint Mary's Institute and
Notre Dame University, Indiana, reported it
without amendment.
Mr. CHANDLER, from the Committee on
Commerce, to whom was referred the petition
of colored citizens of Alabama and Georgia,
praying for an appropriation to each person
who will embark under the auspices of the
American Colonization Society to Liberia,
asked to be discharged from its further consid-
eration, and that it be referred to the Commit-
tee on Finance ; which was agreed to.
He also, from the same commiitee, to whom
was referred the bill (S. No. 442) to amend
section one of an act to prevent and punish
frauds upon the revenue, and for other pur-
poses, approved March 3,1803, reported it with-
out amendment.
Mr. RAMSEY, from the Committee on Post

He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the bill (S. No. 356) for the relief
of Messrs. Gelatt & Moore, reported adversely

order of business.
Mr. MORTON. I ask the Senate to proceed
to the consideration of House bill No. 881 just
reported by the chairman of the Committee on
Finance.
The PRESIDENTpro tempore. It requires
the unanimous consent of the Senate.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I presume the Senator
from Ohio will hardly agree to that.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is perfectly in order
for the Senator from Indiana to ask the unani-
mous consent of the Senate to pass a bill which
has been reported.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The Senator from Ohio
objected to giving unanimous consent a mo-
ment ago.
Mr. SHERMAN. Not at all.
Mr. TRUMBULL. And he ought not to
consent to it now.
Mr. SHERMAN. I objected to all motions
out of order.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. To enter-
tain the motion requires unanimous consent.
Is there any objection ?
Mr. SUMNER. I renew the motion that
the Senate proceed to the consideration of
executive business.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That mo-
tion is in order.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I wish to present a
memorial.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. There is
a motion pending to go into executive session.
The question being put on the motion, it was
declared that the ayes appeared to have it.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I call for a division
until I can submit a question of order, whether
I have not the right to present a memorial be-
fore that vote is taken.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Petitions
and memorials were in order until the Senate
seemed to lie through with them, and then tho
Chair called for the next business in order, the
reception of reports of committees.
Mr. HENDRICKS. That settles that ques-
tion. I did not hear petitions and memorials
called for.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The mo-
tion to go into executive session is in order.
The Chair will put it over again.
The motion was agreed to.

Mr. TRUMBULL. While the doors are
being closed I ask permission to introduce a
bill. I suppose there will be no objection to
that.
By unanimous consent leave was granted to
introduce a bill (S. No. 464) in relation to the
qualifications of jurors; which was read twice
by its title.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I move that the bill be
printed and go upon the Calendar, as it has
already been considered by the Committee on
the Judiciary.
The motion was agreed to.

noil-concurred in others, of the amendments
