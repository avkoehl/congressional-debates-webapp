THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April .18,
EVENING SESSION.
At half past seven o'clock p. m. the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
resumed its session, (Mr. Wheeler in the
chair,) and proceeded with the consideration
of the bill (H. R. No. 1068) to amend existing
laws relating to the duty on imports, and for
other purposes.
Mr. NIBLACK. I would inquire whatis the
condition of the question now?
The CHAIRMAN. Thependingparagraph
is in relation to the duty on pig iron. The
Clerk will report the amendments.
The Clerk lead the amendments. The one
originally moved by Mr. Butler, of Massachu-
setts, was to strikeout "57" and insert "$5,"
to which Mr. Cox moved an amendment, to add
"fifty cents," so that it would read " $5 50."
The CHAIRMAN. Debate is exhausted on
the pending amendment.
Mr. COX. I withdraw the amendment to
the amendment.
Mr. NIBLACK. I move to amend the
amendment by striking out " $5 " and insert-
ing " $3." I have not participated much in
the debate on this bill, either in the general
debate or in the debate in detail; but I have
felt it my duty occasionally to make a note on
some of the points presented in it as we have
passed over them.
On the subject of iron, which is an all-absorb-
ing one with many of the friends of this bill,
I beg the attention of the Committee of the
Whole for a few minutes only. The consider-
ation which I have given to this question of
pig iron has impressed me with the idea that
that article ought not to be placed in the list
of leading articles of manufacture in this
country. In my judgment it is substantially a
raw material; not so in all respects, but ap-
proximately so; and it ought in any well-
digested system of tariff duties to be treated
either as a raw material on the free list or be
admitted at a very low rate of duty, so that
the price of it shall not be unduly enhanced
to those who use pig iron for manufacturing
and mechanical purposes. It is as much a raw
material as are copper and rope in the manu-
facture of ships, as is leather in the manufac-
ture of shoes, or as lime in the preparation of
plaster, or as flour in the manufacture of bread,
or any other article upon which some labor has
to be bestowed in order to prepareit to become
an element in the construction of something else
in the hands of the artisan or skilled manufac-
turer. It is, proximately at least, a raw mate-
rial in the building of railroads, in theconstruc-
tionof the engines, in the manufacture of the or-
dinary tools and iraplementsofagriculture, and
in the manufacture of all machinery of which
iron and steel are either the principal or some
of the component parts. To tax it, therefore,
as it is now taxed, at $9 per ton, or even
at S7 per ton, as is proposed by the present
bill, is to rank it with the leading articles
of manufacture in this country and to enhance
inordinately the price of everything which is
manufactured of iron. This is in the end all
taxed over to the consumer, and is paid by him.
This is a matter, therefore, in which the masses
of the people everywhere are interested, as
every man, woman, and child in the country arc
more or. less consumers of iron in some form.
I do not insist, and do not expect in the
present condition of things, that we will attempt
to put pig iron on the free list or consider it a
raw material, although I trust the day is not
distant when in the interest of commerce, in
the interest of civilization, in the great inter-
ests which control the industries of this country,
it may become so. But it ought not to be made
so suddenly, I suppose, and I do not insist
upon it. Some duty should perhaps be levied
upon it, in justice to those engaged in the busi-
ness. I am willing, as a fair compromise upon
this question, that a fair duty, ranging some-
where from $8 to $5 per ton, may be imposed
under this bill, which will operate as a notice
to those who are now largely engaged in this
business that the policy of the Government
upon this question has been reversed, and that
hereafter a more liberal policy to the great
masses of the people, not only to the manu-
facturers but to the consumers of the country,
shall be and is inaugurated.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. PACKER. Will the gentleman with-
draw his amendment to the amendment?
Mr. NIBLACK. Certainly; I withdraw it.
Mr. PACKER. I move to amend the amend-
ment by striking out "$5 " and inserting "S9,"
the rate under the present law.
Mr. Chairman, the proposed reduction of the
duty upon pig iron from $9 to $7 per ton
looks like an abandonment of the general prin-
ciple which is understood to have been recog-
nized in the preparation of this bill, and would,
I beg leave to say, with all deference to the
honorable chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Means, be a most unwise and injudicious
withdrawal of the fostering care of the Gov-
ernment from one of the great industrial inter-
ests of the country, toward which, in the pres-
ent state of the trade itself and in view of the
peculiar condition of our financial affairs, sound
and enlightened policy would dictate an exten-
sion of increased protection and more liberal
encouragement, rather than a desertion to the
inevitable consequence of direct and unjust
competition with the productions of the cheap
and poorly-paid labor of Europe. For a num-
ber of years there has been a large, and for the
last four years, with higher rates of duty than
now proposed, an alarming increase in the
importations of iron of all kinds. But in the
few minutes allowed me under the rules I will
confine my attention stiictly to the item of pig
iron, now immediately before the committee.
Tho official returns from our own custom-
houses, as compiled from tho official data in
the Bureau of Statistics, show that we im-
ported foreign pig iron during the fiscal year
ending June 30, 1858, stated at the very low
valuation of the custom-house, in gold, at
$739,919; in 1859, at $1,049,200; in 18G0, at
$1,005,805, under an ad valorem, duty of 24
percent. In 1861, at $987,910; in 1862, at
$285,323; in 1863, at $435,194; in 1864, at
$1,288,424, under a specific duty of $6 per ton.
In-1865, at
,552; in I860, at $1,683,186;
in 1867, at $1,831,465; in 1868, at $1,778,9'/1;
in 1869, at $2,138,030, under a specific duty
of $9 per ton.
Otlicial returns published by authority of the
House of Commons show the following ship-
ments of pig iron from Great Britain to the
United States: during the year ending De-
cember 31, 1867, 119,855 tons; during the
year ending December 31, 1868, 86,201 tons;
during the year ending December 31, 1869,
132,485 tons. In the month of January, 1868,
Great Britain sent us 1,799 tons of pig iron;
in the month of January, 1869, 4,821 tons;
and in the month of January, 1870, 8,653 tons.
Showing an increase in the number of tons
received by us in 1869 over the quantity re-
ceived from that source of supply in 1868 of
over 50 per cent., and an increase in the first
month of this year of nearly 100 per cent,
over the corresponding month of last year.
I may remark, in passing, Mr. Chairman,
that the value of railroad iron imported into
the United States for each fiscal year ending
on the 30th day of June was by this same cus-
tom-house valuation in 1858 valued in gold at
$2,987,576; in 1859, $2,274,032; in 1860,
$3,709,376; in 1861, $2,162,695, under an
ad valorem duty of 24 per cent. In 1862,
$222,967, under a specific duty of §12 per ton.
In 1863, $540,494. In 1801, $3,904,017, under
a specific duty of $13 50 per ton. In 1865,
$3,114,213. In 1866, $2,962,416, under an ad
valorem duty of 60 cents per hundred weight.
In 1867, $3,403,715; 1868, $4,373,162; 1869,
$7,305,845, under an ad valorem duty of 70
cents per hundred weight.
From a compilation of official returns lately
published by authority of the House of Com-
mons it appears that Great Britain sent to
the United States during the last three years
the following quantities of railroad iron: year
ending December 31, 1867,16-5,030 tons; year
ending December 31, 1868, 268,000tons; year
ending December 31, 1869, 300,446 tons. In
the month of January, 1868, England sent us
17,999 tons of rails ; in the month of January,
1869, 20,421 tons of rails; in the month of
January, 1870, 24,610 tons of rails.
The average premium upon gold during the
fiscal year ending June 30, 1866, added to the
$9 gold duty upon pig iron, under the present
law, gave to our home production practically
a protection of $13 41 ; in 1867 of $12 GO;
in 1868 of $12 51; and in the fiscal year of
1869, of $12 24 per ton.
With these rates of import duties, Mr. Chair-
man, the importation of pig iron in 1866 more
than doubled that of 1805, when the average
premium on gold ran above 80 per cent. In
1867 we imported 116,519Jj tons; in 1868,
2,246,911 hundred weight, andinl869—I speak
of course of the fiscal year ending on the
30th of June—we imported 2,666,139 hundred
weight; and yet, in the presence of such facts
as these, exhibiting so large an importation,
and showing that the foreign manufacturer,
even with the higher rate of duty, augmented
by the premium upon gold, could and did suc-
cessfully compete with our own people in our
own markets to the extent represented by the
figures I have given, we are asked to reduce
the duty to $7 per ton, with the premium upon
gold down to day to 12 per cent, and reducing
the rate of duty to $7 84 per ton in currency.
If Great Britain could sell us, in round num-
bers, 130,000 tons of pig metal per annum,
with an average duty of $12 69 per ton in cur-
rency, I would like gentlemen who favor this
reduction, in the interest, although not so in-
tended, of the foreign manufacturer, the for-
eign capitalist, and the foreign laborer, to
inform us how much they will send us with the
duty reduced to $7 84 per ton. And I would
like them to tell us, too, how long they think
our home producers, who act upon the princi-
ple that "the laborer is worthy ol his hire,"
and that a fair day's work justly entitles the
workingman to a fair day's wages; who recog-
nize the doctrine, inculcated and enforced by
the liberal principles of our free institutions,
that every man, no matter how humble his po-
sition in life, is entitled to all the rights, the
privileges, the blessings, and protection due
to his high position as a citizen of this great
Republic, where all classes of men have a com-
mon interest in the glory and prosperity of the
nation: that here, where every man may stand
erect in the honest pride of American citizen-
ship, and assert his right to refuse to labor for
a penny less than he may honestly believe he
is justly entitled to receive for his daily toil:
here, where fair and liberal wages are fixed
by contract to which both the employer and
employed are parties ; I repeat, I would like
gentlemen to tell us how long our producers
could stand the unequal contest, subjected to
such a competition with the manufacturers of
Great Britain and Belgium, where labor is not.
paid for or compensated, but is purchased at
such miserable rates as are barely sutficient to
furnish a scanty supply of the most absolute
necessities, and none of the comforts of life !
A few_ of our furnaces, favorably located,
with their ore at their tunnel-head, with their
coal and limestone in convenient proximity,
and with rolling-mills to work up their pig
metal, within a short distance, incurring but
little if any expense for the transportation of
the raw material, may possibly struggle on, as
they have struggled before; butalargenumber

cold blast of congressional neglect, while no
new furnaces would be erected; the whole of
