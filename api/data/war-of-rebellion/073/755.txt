HDQRS. FIRST CAV. DIV., DEPT. ON THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, June 4, 1864-6.30 p. m.

I have the honor to inform you that part of my forces were in Acworth this morning, and drove a small party of fifteen rebels from the town. They could not ascertain the precise location of their picket post, supposed to be a strong one about two miles from the town. Their main cavalry force is at Big Shanty. I respectfully ask permission to move my command to Acworth to-morrow, as I can command this country as well from there as from my present position. I also ask permission to attack General Williams in the morning at Big Shanty.

Colonel, Commanding.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I sent Colonel Dorr's brigade toward the hospital, as ordered. He scouted the country in that vicinity without finding any enemy. There has not been more than a small party, ten or twelve, near there at any time. On Sandtown road some of my pickets captured 3 of the Thirty-fourth Georgia Infantry. They report Hardee's corps on Sandtown road, about two miles from our vedettes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

These parties, on being attacked, retired toward the left. They were evidently scouting parties endeavoring to ascertain the position of our lines.
