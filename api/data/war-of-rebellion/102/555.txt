HEADQUARTERS EAST SUB-DISTRICT OF THE PLAINS,Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter., May 22, 1865.

Captain GEORGE F. PRICE,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Dist. of the Plains, Julesburg, Colo. Ter.:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to inclose you official copy of telegram received from General Dodge. I presume it was sent from the fact of General Dodge knowing that General Connor has left Atchison, and that it was impossible to communicate with him by telegraph. Inclosed you will also find official copy of my reply to him. The whole matter will be laid before General Connor on his arrival here.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. R. LIVINGSTON,

Colonel First Nebraska Cav. Vet. Vols., Commanding Sub-District.

[Inclosure Numbers 1.]HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., May 22, 1865.

Colonel LIVINGSTON,

Fort Kearny:

How far down the Blue have you any troops stationed? At what points do you think more should be placed?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

[Inclosure Numbers 2.]HEADQUARTERS EAST SUB-DISTRICT OF THE PLAINS, Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter., May 22, 1865.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

The following are the stage stations east of Fort Kearny on Atchison road: Hooks, 9 miles; Sandy Hill, 17; Muddy, 28; Elm Creek, 40; Pawnee Ranch, 50; Buffalo, 60; Little Blue, 39; Kiowa, 83; Thompson's, 97; Big Sandy, 109, respectively. I have permanent infantry guards of one non-commissioned officer and six men at Elm Creek, Pawnee Ranch, Buffalo, and Little Blue stations, the most exposed points on the road. There should be one non-commissioned officer and ten men at all the stations from Big Sandy to this post. I also have four mounted men at all the stations from Big Sandy to Kearny to escort stages, and ten mounted men under Captain Gillette, at Big Sandy, to escort Speaker Colfax through. I have only two reliefs of guard at this post. If infantry are sent up they should garrison all stations from Big Sandy west. Rest assured no harm will be done to coaches, and if trains were organized at Atchison or Big Sandy all would be safe and well. I have a detachment out after the Indians who struck the Blue, and think they will be punished, but out stock is so miserable that if it comes to a chase were powerless. General Connor left Atchison to-day.

Respectfully,

R. R. LIVINGSTON,

Colonel, Commanding Sub-District.
