GRAVELLY RUN, March 29, 1865.

Major-General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

I think the movement of Humphreys south of hatcher's Run up to the Crow house must have moved the enemy back from the front of your left next to the run. If you can push up to the north side of the run to the Armstrong house, or farther, it will re;l;ease a whole division on the south side.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 29, 1865.

(Received 5.30 p. m.)

General ORD,

Humphreys' Station:

Did your cavalry get off this afternoon? How do things look in your front? Does the enemy seem to be drawing off any forces from there? If he weakens much you might try to make a hole through his line and move up the north side of Hatcher's Run.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,March 29, 1865 - 9.45 p. m.

General U. S. GRANT:

Your dispatch calling for cavalry came about 5.30. Mackenzie was a mile off. He came here about 7, knew nothing of the road, asked for a guide; too dark without one. The guide has just come, and Mackenzie will be off in a few minutes. The enemy show a stronger line than mine. Do not think they have they have drawn troops from here.
