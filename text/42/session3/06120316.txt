The Chief Clerk, (W. J. McDonald, esq.)
The Vice President having notified the Senate

ident of the United States and inform him that in

The Journal of yesterday's proceedings was

ORDER OF BUSINESS. ,
Mr. RICE. I ask unanimous consent to
call up the resolution which I offered on Tues-
day morning.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Pending
the call of petitions and memorials, the Sen-
ator from Arkansas asks unanimous consent to
proceed to the consideration of a resolution
offered by him. Is there objection ?
Mr. SHERMAN. I would rather go on
with the morning business.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
is made.
Mr. SHERMAN. I shall have no objection
after the morning business is through.
Mr. RICE. Let the resolution be called up
aud then 1 will give way to morning business.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will not object if that
is the pleasure of the Senate.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If there
be no objection, the resolution is before the
Senate
Mr. CONKLING. What is the resolution ?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The reso-
lution offered by the Senator from Arkausas
inquiring into certain alleged frauds in the
election in that State.
Mr. CONKLING. That I understand is
a matter which will be debated. I do not wish
to object, but I hope the Senator will not in-
terpose that resolution so as to interfere with
the morning business. Let us go through with
the morning business first.
Mr. RICE. I propose to give way to the
morning business when the resolution is taken
np.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. If no ob-
jection be made the resolution is before the
Senate.
Mr. SHERMAN. Now I desire to present
some petitions, as I understand the Senator
gives way for morning business.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I rise to
object, for the reason that I understand there
is some little business which it is important
for us to pass before the adjournment, perhaps
more important than the adoption of this
resolution. I therefore object.
Mr. RICE. I see from the morning papers
that the President, in answer to the Louisiana
delegation, has suggested this very course of
having Congress appoint a" coomittee to in-
vestigate these troubles in order that proper
information may be had by the Administration.
He says that they have no power to send any-
body there to collectproof, and that this is the
only course by which proof can be had. I
cannot see that the resolution will give rise to
much debate. It is simply an application for
a committee to investigate affairs in Arkansas
in order that Congress and the Administration
may be informed of the true state of affairs.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore It requires
unanimous consent to take up the resolution
at this time, and the Senator from Vermont
has objected. Petitions and memorials are in
order.

Mr. SHERMAN presented the petition of
Mary A. Porter Brown, praying remuneration
for the services of her late husband, John P.
Brown, as secretary and dragoman of the
