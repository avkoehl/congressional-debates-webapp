HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Mobile, January 31, 1864.

Lieutenant General L. POLK:

GENERAL: I hope your occupations in Mississippi will not prevent you from visiting this place at an early day. I think you will find much of interest here, and hope much from your suggestions and advice after you shall have made a personal examination into the condition of the defenses and of the troops.

Up to this time I have failed to procure satisfactory evidence of such preparations in New Orleans as would indicate an intention to attack Mobile. By information received on yesterday. I learn that up to the 19th instant there was no adequate preparation going on there; from several other sources I have learned that there were no visible preparations for any attack on Mobile. On the other hand, I hear the rumor repeated that Farragut is about to force the passage of the outer line, but I can procure no satisfactory evidence that he has such a fleet as will be required to attack successfully the Bay batteries.

My preparations are nevertheless pressed as rapidly as practicable. Negroes are now coming in and supplies of ordnance stores come in also, but they are very far from what I need for a long siege.

I hope to hear that I will soon have the pleasure of seeing you here, and am,

Very respectfully, yours,

DABNEY H. MAURY.
