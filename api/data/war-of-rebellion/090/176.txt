some 300 or 400 yards in advance of the Third Division, on the left, and on account of the slowness of the Nineteenth Corps, on the right, it led the charge. The enemy broke in confusion before this advance, and were followed so vigorously that they failed to reform or to offer any serious resistance. At sundown, the enemy having been driven across Cedar Creek, the brigade was ordered to the camp it left in the morning.

In this engagement Lieutenant Tucker, One hundred and twenty-first New York, was killed; and Colonel Mackenzie, Captain Burham, Lieutenant Smith, and Lieutenant Snowden, Second Connecticut; Major Galpin and Acting Lieutenant Howland, One hundred and twenty-first New York, and Lieutenant Burns, battalion Ninety-sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers, were wounded.

Too much praise cannot be given to the officers of this command for their self-sacrificing bravery. Captain Roome, assistant adjutant-general, who was wounded early in the action, and Lieutenant Cleveland, acting assistant inspector-general, for their efficiency, deserve special mention.

Out of forty seven officers who went into action twenty were killed or wounded. Out of thirteen mounted officers, eleven had their horses shot.

A company of the Second Connecticut, on picket at Mine Bank Ford, wee surrounded and taken prisoners in the morning. No fault has been found with the officer commanding the company.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. OLCOTT,

Lieutenant-Colonel 121st New York State Vols., Comdg. Brigade.
