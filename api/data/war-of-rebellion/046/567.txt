HEADQUARTERS LEGARE'S POINT,August 10, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that in pursuance of your instructions, I opened fire this morning from a 10-pounder Parrott gun upon the Yankee working party in the marsh, nearly in the direction of Craig's Hill.

Major Manigault, commanding artillery, reports that he-

Commenced firing at 8 a. m. and fired 4 shells. The distance being so great (probably 2 miles), it was impossible to see whether any actual damage was done; but the first shot evidently disturbed the party, and after the fourth they all dispersed to the high land of Morris Island.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. V. GLOVER,

Major, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS LEGARE'S POINT,August 23, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that on yesterday, at the tenth round, the mortar bed gave way, in consequence of the splitting of the front transom. Both mortars are now useless. At 2.20 p. m. the 4.62-inch rifle siege gun, on Platform, Numbers 1, burst. The breech was blown out without any other damage. The bands were neither broken nor thrown off, and the rear one only somewhat loosened.

The following shots were fired yesterday from Battery Haskell:

The 10-inch mortar fired 10 shots; the 8th columbiad fired 31, shots; the 4.62-inch rifle fired 7 shots (burst); the 24-pounder (5.82 caliber) fired 20 shots; the 4.62-inch rifle fired 12 shots; the 24-pounder smooth-bore fired 9 shots; the 20-pounder Parrott fired 9 shots-all premature explosions on account of the worthlessness of the shell, bursting near the muzzle of the gun.

As we are now without the use of the mortars, I would respectfully urge that iron beds be furnished (if possible) for them; if not, the strongest wooden, the range being so great that it requires them to be fired with the extreme charge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. V. GLOVER,

Major, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
