SIR: If your orders are to report to or join me, you will on reaching this place proceed with your forces to-night and join me as early as possible at Kelso. I will march all night, and to overtake me you must do the same. Take some citizen as a guide. The bearer of this will show you one.

Major-General WALLACE:

I hear from the operator at North Vernon you are still at Osgood. Has any of your infantry advanced from that point? The Governor is opposed to the plan. Answer immediately.

General WALLACE,

Sunman:

Dispatch received. Please let your men [sic] but keep them on hand so they can be move quickly. Hascall's command has been ordered from Hamilton to Cincinnati by Burnside. The cars are collecting here to move you-probably to-morrow morning. You will be able to return if not further required. Please telegraph me the number of men and horses in the three brigades, and how many has Hughes got, so that transportation can be provided. Some of the transportation will start this afternoon; the rest to-night.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

General WILLCOX,

Indianapolis:

I beg you will let me get wagons to put my men in. Sticking to railroad lines will never enable us to catch Morgan. I have here Hughes' brigade and Love's and the battery, all in excellent condition, and about 4,500 effective. By to-morrow morning I will have wagon transportation for the whole, and will make sixty miles in fifteen hours. Say the word and let me go on.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General.
