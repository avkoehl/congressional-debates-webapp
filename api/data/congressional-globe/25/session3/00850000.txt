Mi PREiNTISb, of Mississippi, who was en-
titled to the flooi, resumed his icm it lis ftom yes
lerday, and having ie\iewcd at some length the
various topics embiacid in the message, and m
paiticular that part having refeitnce to the di fal
cations, concluded about foui o'clock, at which
time,
Mi CUSHMAN, who obtained the floor,
moved, at the suggestion of several members, that
the committee now rise
The committee accordingly rose and repoited
piogtess
WORKMEN ON THE TREASURY BUILDING.
Mr   LINCOLN asked the indulgence of the
House that the joint resolution proposing to in
demmfy the woikmeti on the Tieasury building
foi the loss of time during the suspension ot the ir
labors last summer, which was ordered to be en-
grossed a few days ago, be now read a third time
No objection being made, the resolution re-
ceived its third reading, when
Mr RENCHER objected to the passage of the
resolution He considered the principle involved
in it as un]ust The petitioners would make it
appear that the Government was under an obli-
gation to pay them their wages, whether they
were at work or not But he maintained that if
there was any obligation at all, that obligation
was recipiocal, and that the workmen were as
much bound to remain with Government, as the
lattei was to pay them He knew that no one
would contend tor a momi nt the woikmen had
not the power to leave at any time and seek em
plovmi nt elsewhere, theiefoie the Government
eould upon no pu iciple of justiee be requited to
pay them when then sei vices woie not demanded
With these views, he moved the leferenee of the
whole subject to the Committee on Claims
Mi   LINCOLN" hoped the genlleman  would
not persist in his motion, as it would be very easy
to satisfy him that the claim was based on the
stnctest principles of equity    Mr  L  then went
on to ¡show that the laboiers had come from a
gieat distance, and were engaged undei apiomise
that they should be employed <br the whole sea-
son     All thev sought for wis indemnity foi the
actual loss sustained dm ing the suspension of the
woik by oidei of the Piesidcnt, and the resolu-
tion  piovided  that, if they had  in  the interim
obtained employment elsewhere,  surh  amount
should be deducted    The fact was, the men eon-
|   sidered themselves bound to continue in the city
j under their agieement, for they did not know how
I soon thev might be required to resume the work
I It was true the amount of loss was small, but to
|   pool men with laige famines, and who had no
other resources, it was an important object   He
I felt confident that, after such an explanation, all
opposition would be withdi iwn
|i      Befoie taking the question, however,
|      On motion of Mi   LEGARE, the House ad-
journed

SALT DUTIES.
Mi BENTON lose to submit a motion, and
hoped that he might engage the particular atten-
tion of tl e Si nate to it, because he was unwihmg
that any membei should vote on any subject
without distinctly understindmgit The motion,
winch he diemed to be of thegieatestimpoitance,
was somewhat dificient from motions geneially
mide in Congiess, as it had no relation to poli-
tics, but related solely to the agricultural inteiests
of the country, the iaoonng classes, and those
engaged in the puisuits of industry He would
now proceed to state his motion, or rather to lead
it, as he had íeduced it to wilting for the sake of
precision and to enable thefeecietary with gieater
tacility to take it down His motion was to print
certain papers relating to the salt duties, and to
'he use of salt in agncultuie and the various de
pirtments oi the animal economy and vegetable
kingdom The fust of these papers owed its on-
gm to inquiries set on foot in England by Loid
Kenyon, before the Board of Trade, when Mr
Vansittai t was president of that body. The other
was a senes of evidence taken befoie the House
of Commons, foi the puipose of showing the ef-
f. cts of the salt duty on the interests of theagu-
eulttual classes Both oí these papéis were or-
deied by the House of Commons to be printed
