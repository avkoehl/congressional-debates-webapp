division to the Ashby's Gap and Aldie road, near Upperville, following with the rest of his command as far as it can march. General Burnside will occupy Bloomfield, Union, and Philomont, with General Reynolds on his left, and one division of the latter's corps advanced to Mddleburg. General Pleasonton has been ordered to move forward to-morrow morning to the Manassas Gap Railroad, near Springfield. A report just received from him states that he has been skirmishing in front of Philomont to-day with Stuart, who outnumbers him and has also infantry troops with his command. The commanding general therefore directs you to march at an early hour to-morrow morning, to re-enforce General Pleasonton at or near Philomont. Upon coming up with him, you will accordingly report to him with your command for duty.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
