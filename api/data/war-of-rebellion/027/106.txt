extremely heavy. He is a most meritorious, energetic, and trustworthy officer. Captain William G. Rankin, Thirteenth Infantry, and acting assistant quartermaster, has also served with much credit. He was in charge of land transportation at White House, and acquitted himself with satisfaction. Lieutenant Colonel Frederick Myers, assistant quartermaster, served with the army from Pope's retreat until after Fredericksburg. He was most of the time my chief assistant. Like Colonel Sawtelle, he is invaluable as a quartermaster and superior business man. I trust these officers will receive the advancement they merit.

The chief quartermasters of the corps are all finely adulated gentlemen and highly experienced quartermasters, and there are many quartermasters now serving with divisions and brigades who are well qualified for higher positions.

In conclusion, I wish to bring to your notice the admirable administration and executive ability of Captains Ferguson and Stoddard, quartermasters at Alexandria. Their duties have been very onerous and accumulated, and have been most efficiently performed. They both occupy high and important positions, and the Army of the Potomac is indebted to them in part for many of its supplies.

I am, general, your most obedient servant,

RUFUS INGALLS. General M. C. Meigs.

Numbers 4. Report of Surg. Jonathan Letterman, U. S. A., Medical Director, Army of the Potomac, of the medical department, September 2-Nov.7.

From the date of the embarkation of the troops at Fortress Monroe up to the time when the general was placed ;in command of the defenses of Washington, I know personally but little of the medical department of the Army of the Potomac. It was not under my control. On the 2nd of September, when the general was placed in command, it came once more under my direction, and I found it in a most deplorable condition. The officers were worn down by the labors they had in the mean time undergone; a large portion of their supplies, as I have stated, had been left at Fortress Monroe, and even much of that which they had brought with them was thrown on the read side, I have been informed by commanding officers, whilst on their way to join General Pope. This state of things, taken in connection with the effects upon the medical department arising from the campaign of that officer, left it in a condition deeply to be deplored. The labor expended at Harrison's in rendering it efficient for active service seemed to have been expended in vain, and before it could be in a condition to render such service again it was
