foreclose alterations, propositions, and debate, in
the Committee of the Whole. If he understood
the tiue purpose and use of standing committees,
it was to take into consideration memonals, les-
olutions, and mattois connected with them in
then mcipieit stage; or hills, if theii recentintro-
duction and novelty render it expedient; so that
having them before them, and all the facts, which
may be numerous and diversified, and with which
it is not presumed the House aie acquainted,
they, the standing committees, may give such a
condensed form to the subject, with then recom-
mendation, as to place it intelligibly before the
House, and enable it to make such final disposi-
tion of the matter as they may think light and
proper to do
Objections have been raised to the reference of
this bill, upon the ground that the appropriation
bills should fiist be acted on and passed, before
this is taken up, in order that it may be known
whethertheie will be any surplus in the Tieasury
to be distributed. Whatever weight theie may
be in that objection, it is met and answeied, in
great part, by the operation of the special Older
of Januai y last, giving precedence to the appro-
priation bill¡> o\ei otheis. I piesume they will
first be called up and disposed of, before this bill
would be passed. But if it is meant to be con-
tended, that this bill shall not be íepoited by a
standing committee, until all the appiopnation
bills aie finally acted upon by this House and the
Senate, and shall íeceive the sanction of the Ex-
ecutive, then the consequence is apparent and in-
evitable, that this bill is not to berepoitcd by the
standing committee, or if so, it will be so late m
the session as to lender it impracticable to give to
it that considt lation which it deserves, and to
place it in a situation that it is not piobable it
would lecene the legislativo action of Congiess
duung this session So that it appears to me,
whatever weight the aigiimpntiiifavorofv,aitin°-
for this puipose. may otherwise have, it is re-
moved by the position m which the business of
the House is placed by antecedent íules, and by
the fact that it is a virtual denial of the considcia-
tion of the bill
This bill has already passed the Senate of the
United States, and although I mean not Fay that
it is not the duty of this House to eximine this
and all other bills that aie sent here, I hold it to
be the incumbent duty of the House, and ofcvciy
member, to o\-imino, and judge foi himself of the
propriety of cioiy measure, vet it did stiike me,
whethei conectly or not I leave for otheis to say,
as I halt not hcaid the argument used, tKitafki
the subject had iceived so much of the pubhc
attention, aftei it had occupied so much of the
consideiation of the Senate, where this bill ha"
been for between font and five months, and of
the membcis of this House, (for it is within the
lecollection of eveiy one, that duung the discus
sion there, foi a part of the time at least, such
was the intense an-siety of memlx rs, thit it «as
difficult to kerp a quorum hcio to tnn^act the
cunent business v hich was then on hind ) aftei
all this, I submit to the consideiation of gentle-
men, whether the comity to be shown by one
coordinate branch of the Legislatme to another,
and the respect which is due to the labor be-
stowed bv the Senate, and thetirm occupied theie,
would not dictitc such a com so m the disposition
of this bill, as may not lea\e the laboi employed
and the time consumed there, to be us<di ss and
vain for all the practical purposes of legislation
This bill pioposes to distribute a portion of the
surplus funds of the Government, about which
there has been, I think I am safe in saying, more
anxiety than upon any other subject to which the
public attention has been called dui ing the p¡ esent
session When has been the day, that the inquiry
has not passed fiom one member of this House
to another, " what shall be done with tin surplus
money m the Treasuty" Is not the same sohei
tude manifested f om all quarters of the country,
and by all who witntss the deliberations of this
body If, then, that question is deemed so vital
to the puuty of the Government, and so impoit-
ant to its faithful administration, it cannot fail to
appear to every one, that this leading and absoib-
mg subject, -which tends to the puipose, at least
one of the ptuposes, of disposing oí the surplus
funds oí tne Government, should be placed in
such a situation as that the opinion of this House
may be indicated, and the vote of members bé
taken upon the mam question, withoutthe hazard
of gettins; no vote at all upon that question.
It is, then, of impoitancc to the country and to
Congress, that this bill should be acted upon as
speedily and effectively as its nature will admit
of Butwhile ltisimpoitant m thispomtof view,
that this House should come up at once to the
matter before them, it is not less important to the
States, with reference to the ulterior disposition
which they may make of then pioportionate
shai e of these pi oceeds upon the supposition that
the bill should pass into a law, that it should be
known what is to be its fate If the bill should
pass into a law, and pass in season, the Legisla-
tures of some of the btites may convpne, (such
at least may be the case m the State of Pennsyl-
vania,) and be m session, in sufficient time, to
pass upon the subject, which in that event would
become an inteiesting question, andwoithy of
immediate consideiation by the Legislatuics of
the lespective States In this aspect of the mat-
ter, this icfertnoi, m my aj^prchcnsion, acquires
additional consequence, and in that pomtof view,
also, I hoj)e it will be consideied by this House
Sir, I have but little moic at this time to tiou-
ble the House with Thci.e aie my reasons foi
uigmg the reference of this bill to such a com-
mittee as will give to it the atttntion of all its
membeis, and msuie the vote of membcis on one
side 01 the other without delay, it is not speeches
that aie wanted Upon this 1 was foiciblystruck
with an observation of the honorable gentleman
o\ci the way [Mr Ad\ms] at the early part of
the session, I haie since thought it one of the
mostcs^cntialtiuisms whn h has been pi enounced
heic this session, " tnat all would agiee that a
\ ote was of m oi e eon si quence here than a speech ''
In conclusion, sn, I ha\e only to appeal to gen-
tlemen to come up and meet this qivstion fauly
and independently it is scaicely to be supposed
that an opinion is yet to be foi mod, or a vote to
be changed by anything that will be said oi done
in i elation to this subject The tiust is confided ,
to us of acting, and so to act as to advance the
jiubhc mtacst, that when a public mca^uie is in j
itself unworthy of the sanction of this House, to
put otu negatiic upon it by intuís chiect, but if
itb< meiitonous, to can y out the means of making
it effectual
Mi.  WILLIAMS, of Kentucky,  gave  the
reasons winch had induced him to move to icfei
the  bill to  the Comnnttct of the Whole on the
state of the Union     He wished to be pel nutted
to remark, although it  might  seem  somewhat
stixngc <u some gi utlemcn, that this bill was not
ciMiy favmite meaoui   with him; notwithstand- '
ing, h   thought it piol able th it he should \oto |
foi it     1 lifie wen   ob|ections to the bill which
In  should hki  to  see lcmcm d   still he did not j
know but he should be induced to vott   for it
He v asoppos d to leff mug the bill to the Com-
mittee ot Ways and "Means, because he consid- I
eiod th it to n f< r it to th it committee would be j
tantamount to x ieji etion of it    That committee,
he believed, nevei would lepoit it to the House,
but would hold it back as they had done another
measure oí his which they had in their posses-
sion
Mr CAMBRELFNG explained It was true
that the committee h id not icooited on that gen-
tleman's resolution He hoped, howevei, that
the committee would not be censured for this,
because it must be admitted by all, that the lepoit
which he was nistiucted shoitly to make would
be much more «attsfaetory to the House and to
the country than a report could have been m
Febiuarylast, as thcywould ha\c amuchbettei
knowlt dge of the state of the finances now than
they could ha-se had then
Mr. WILLI VMS said the explanation was not
satisfactoiy, as his proposition, which the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means had under consider-
ation, did not specify a single dollar that was to
be distubiued It only pioposedtodis'ribute the
suiplus; and, if theie was no suiplus at the end
of the year, there would be no distiibution
Mi W contended that theie was no necessity to
íefer the bill to one of the standing committees
of the House, but that it should be referíed to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
whéfe if coiilti be discussed, «mended., aad acted
iipén at the tSresSnt session.
Mr. BYNUM said the course taken by gen-
tlemen on the present occasion was such that he
was disposed to doubt their sincerity. It ap-
peared to him that they could not believe their
own assertions The gentleman who had just
addressed the House, and the gentleman who
addressed the House yesterday, [Mí. GrakoeRjj'
had told them that it was important that the sub-
ject should be acted upon immediately—that the
countiy required immediate action Did those
gentlemen suppose that they could carry a meas-
ure like this Without theie being sagacity enough
among the Demoeiacy to detect its fallacy? It
was a mistake; the Demoeraoy were not so simple
as the friends of this measure seemed to suppose.
The gentleman who addiessed the House on yes-
terday wished to have the House act on the bill
immediately He said, " Pass the bill now, and
it becomes a law." Now, he would ask gentle-
men if they believed this —or, if the people of
the countiy believed it' He would ask every
honest man of that House—he would ask the gen-
tleman from New Yoik, and the gentleman from
Kentucky—whether they behoved that this bill
would become a taw, even if it did pass the House
this session  No, they well knew the President
would veto it Had he not already vetoed a
similar bill' Yet this firm old man, who never
swerved when he once made up an opinion, was
to be persuaded by these gentlemen to sign this
bill He thought gentlemen could not cnteitatn
the opinion that this bill could become a law with
these facts stating them m the face. They coulñ
not pass this bill into a law. The people did not
believe it, they wore too intelligent to relieve it;
and upon that intelligence depended the preserv-
ation of the hbeities of the people. So much for
the necessity of speedy action. Had the bill been
discussed sufficiently to throw all the light and
infoimation before the people of the country
which was necessaiy > It it was for the inteiest
of the people of the country, let them have all the
facts befoie them, and let them decide upon It
again, as they had already done. Let us give all
the infoimation which can be procured to the
people, and then let them decide
But, say, gentlemen, we aie prepared to vote
now, because the bill has been passed in the
Senate, and came from the Senate.   No doubt
they weie prepaied to vote upon it, because it
was the offspring of their oracle. It was the very
hobby which was to give them success.    It was
made the hobby by every sptcies of politicians.
This was the little pony which the anti-Masonic
party, the National Republican paity, the Aboli-
tion paity, the no-paity paity, and many other
parties, were to ndc, and he teaied that the little
pony would   be  so  buidened  that he   would
| break down and ltavc thi m all    Mi  B. would
i let the facts go to the people, and let them take
I the matter in hand and say whether this little
' pony was to cairy all these parties into office or
j not.    He asked if the pioposition to lefei this
subject to the Committee of Ways and Means
I was an unusual proposition'   When a bill was
| sent fiom one House to another, the usual course
I   was to refer to one of the standing committees.
II  He cited the foitification bill, which had passed
j the House by an overwhelming majority, yet
I  when it went to the other bianeh of Congiess it
I was refcired to the proper committee. Then cer-
I tamly they had a precedent tor this case, and
II  fi om a body which alw ays, m the opinion of the
j advocates of this bill, did things m a proper man-
ner. It was not an unusual course for the bill to
1 take. It was the uniform practice, when bills
were sent from one House to the other, to refer
them to some selector standing committee. Un-
questionably this was the proper course. There
was a great difference of opinion as to the amount
of money to be distributed Some contended that
there were at present thirty or forty millions of
dollars m the Treasury, whilst others did not
believe there was more than half that amount.
Under these circumstances, this bill comes into
the House,and gentlemen say they are prepared
to vote for it, because it had passed the other
branch of Congress, and thev took it for granted
that there was this large amount of money in the
Treasury.   But (Mr. B. said) there were some
