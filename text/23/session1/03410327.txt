¡Now, wherever a ciimipal cnarge was laid, a
criminal intent was necessary, but in the absei ce

by S natois in th ir places of other gentlemen
susta ning unconstitutional ac s, and aie they not
retorted upon as being peifectly constitutional
And yet, is there any char'e of wilful violation?
None, sir, none No one but the President of
the United Stages would tmnk that a charge of a
violation of the Constitution was a charge of wilful
■violation To satisfy him, there is but one example
• m the world whicluhis Senate could have pursued,
and that is, a certain collared eüitoi, who thinks
this act unconstitutional, but qualifies it by saying
t^at the President acted from the puiestand most
patriotic motives, ai d therefore, the measuie was
to be suppoited
There 13 another thing in this most ex raord
nary message1    The appeal to the people is no,,
only for what the Senate has done, but for wnat
it has not done—for a resolution which v. as j 10
posed here, but which was  not parsed    Tne
protest says
" Still further to exemplify tms feature cf the
' proceeding, it is important to be remarked, that
' thereso'ution, as orig pally ofWed to the Senate,
' soecified, w'th adequate precision, certain ads of
' the President, which it denounced as a violation
'of the Constitution and laws, and that it was
' not until the very close of the debate, and when,
' perhaps, it was apprehended that a majority
' mightnotsustamthespecificacrusationeontained

judicially   Sir, (saidMi   L ,) have you not heard
of resolutions being introduced into the British
HouseofCommons,dec!ar ngapiincipleon which
ro legislative ac'ion took place, oí vas intended?
if the Pr-sident figured in 'h  Revolution, as he
says in a part of this pape>  Mr  L  hoped he had
read the history of tho«e time", and it he d d, he I
would remember Lord Dunmng's resolution in the
House  of Commons,  on  which  Lord  North'b
administration was first defea ed, and the power
of the Crown dimir ished    D d George the Thud
then serd a message complaining of that act as
unconstitutional?   Mr   L   supposed everv man
who had read anything had íesd J mius's letters
In the year 17G9, du-ing the second year of the
pdministiation of Lord Chatham, a íesolution was
parsed by the House of Lords declaring that the
Crown possessed no right to suspend any law of
he land    Was this legislative action, or designed
a  the foundation for i ?    Anc 3 et did George the
Third   complain   tl at   the  Hnu&e  of Lords  had
transcended its duty, and assumed an unconstitu
tionai powei, by declaim  his proclamation to be
illeetil?   No, s r    Did William Pitt, the proudest
minister that ever England had, go  before his
country and appeal to  the  people of England
against the House of Lords, and complain that
| the House of Lords had condemned him in vio
I lation of the Constitution of his country?   Did
it alaim  his pride?   No, sir, no     No man but
I Andiew Jackson ever thought of such a thmg
I Mr L  said he had no enmity against tne Presi
dent   On the contrary, he w shed his administra-
tion to be as successful as his best friends expected
it to be     But he had a presumption which no
mortal man had ever  before been cursed  with,
which no monarch sine the days of King Henry j
I the Eighth ever claimed before                                  ]
I     Sir, (stud Mr   L ,) was the e no necessity for i
I the passage of this resolution or rather was there
not a paloable neces=i'y for i     Remember tl e his-
tory out of which these ex raordmary transactions
I had grown      V\ e President published a papT,
' which he read to his Cabinet as the reasons for re
moving the public deposites from the Bank of the
United States, and said that them-asure was done
upon his own  íesponsibihty,  that the measure
itself was his own, and then comes his Secretary
of the Treasury, who assigns a series of what he
is pleased to call reasons for the removal of the
deposites, and the first of these íesolutions con-
demns those reasons as unsatisfactory and insuf-
ficient     But over and above the reasons which
the Secretary gave stood the other reason, that the
President ordered the Secretary to remove the de
posites, and that, Mr  L ventured to say, was the
sole reason foi the act, foi if Roger B  Taney had
dared to do this deed, or if the President cf the
United States shmld now remove Ins hand from

at this with the contiol of the Army and Navy,
he claims an Executive control over our pioceed-
in£S here, and that he is to ]udge, no we, when
we aie within the pale of our constitutional duty
But another thing The President is of opinion
that when the resolution is not coupled with the
intent to found some legislative act upon it, that it
is unconstitutional and that heieaftei, when reso-
lutions aie f roposed aa tne foundation of a prin-
ciple, a silent acquiescence in this would cause it
to be claimed as a p.ecedent To him (said Mr
L ) it appeared that whethe, leg s ative action 0,1
the resolution would ensue, depended on theaction
md i roceed.nss in the House of Repieseiua.ves
But Ihe Piesidei t says there cannot be legislative
action upon it,and, therefore, that we were acting
President in his own protest
" The custody of the public property, under
' such 1 emulations as may be prescribed by legisla-
tive authouty, has alwivs been considered an
'appropriate function of the executive department
' 111 this and all other Governments In accord-
' anee with this principle, every species of property
' belonging to the United Sta'es (excepting that
'which is in the use of the several cooidmate
' depprtments of the Government, as means to aid
1 them in performing their appropriate functions)
'ism charge of officeis appointed by the Piesi
'dent, whethei it be lands, 01 buildings, or mer-
' chandi~e, or piovisions, or cbthmsc, 01 arms and
'munitions of war The superintendent* and
1 ' ke-pers of the whole are appointed by the Presi-
" dent, responsible to him, and removable at hia
' will
" Public money is but a species of public pro-
' perty     It cannot be raised by taxation or cus-
' toms, nor brought into the Treasury in any other
' way,except bylaw, but whenever or howsoever
' obtained, its custody always has been,and always
' must be, unless the Constitution be changed, m-
' trusted to the executive department     No officer
' can be created by Congress for the purpose of
' taking charge ot it, whose appointment would
' not, by the Constitution, at once devolve on the
' President, and who would not be responsible to
' him for the faithful performance of his duties.
' Thelegislativepovvermay undoubtedly bind him
' and the President, by any laws they may think
' proper to enact, they may prescribe in what place
' particular portions of the public money shall be
' kept, and for what reason it shall be removed, as
' they may dinct that supplies for the army or
' navy shall be kept in particular stores, and it will
' be the duty of the President to see that the law
' is faithfully executed—yet will the custody re-
1 main in the executive department of theGovern-
' ment    Were the Congress to assume, with or
' without a legislative act, the power of appointing
' officers independently of the President, to take
' the charge and custody of the public property.
' contained in the military and naval arsenals, mag
' azines, and store-houses, it 13 believed that such
' an act would be regarded by all as a palpable
' usurpation of executive power, subversive of the
' form as well as the fundamental principles of our
' Government    But where is the difference in prm-
' ciple, whether the public property be in the form
' of arms, munitions of war, and supplies, or in
'gold and silver, or bank notes?   None can be
' perceived—none is believed to exist    Congiess
' cannot, theiefore, take out of the hands of the
' executive department the custody of the public
'property 01  money, without an assumption of
'executive power, and a subversion of the first
' principles of the Constituí on "
This was the pimciple upon which these pro-
ceedings were founded, and which we think are
not warranted by the Constitution Sir, no one
has the custody of the public money It has been
dispersed abroad,andlettwo-tlnrdsofbothHouses
of Congiess, or let a unanimous vote of both
Houses, declare that the control of the public
money properly belongs to Congress, and still the
President will appeal to the people and put in the
balance his pi erogative, an d depend upon the result
of the decision, with the same confidence of success
he now does But where has the President dis-
covered his right to hold thecustody of the public
treasure ? Look to the enumerated powers hi the
Constitution, and see if you can find it Notatall.
The very highest powers under the Government
are claimed for him, and the most trivial precedents
are adduced to sustain him,powers which, if yield-
ed, will destroy the just balance of the Constitu-
tion, if we do not stand by and sustain it Now,
the President claims the power of removal of every
marshal of every cojrt of the United States, and
if he possesses it, may he not compel or letard the
execution of piocess issuing from those courts at
his own will and pleasure? There never was so
enormous a stretcn of executive power claimed in
any free Government, and yet he appeals to the
good people of this country to sustain him in it.
Mr L desired to give very briefly his opinion of
the powers inheient ir the executive department.
He admitted that all the powers which Congress
should, in add tion to those be derived from the
Constitution, vest in Him, he might exercise, but
to claim all executive powers, is, to convert this
Government into a mere monarchy Whether
elec'ive foi foui years or not, it is the principle of
a monarchy, and nothing e'se For observe, the
President says, that Congress has no power over
the public purse Now suppose the case of the
Commissioneis of the sinking fund, the Chief Jus-
tice of the United States is one of those officers,
the Vice President is another—all placed beyond
the reach of the President They apply vast suma
of money in extinguishment of the public debt;
and can the President interfere with them in dis-
charge of that duty ?
But Mr L would inquire, by what authority
does the President send this piotest to us? There
is one paragraph m the Constitution of the United
