HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Near Adairsville, May 17, 1864-midnight.

General McPHERSON:

Come via Adairsville, but try and keep on some road west of the railroad. This road now is almost blocked with men, wagons, &amp;c. I am not surprised that you were in doubt whether we were in battle or skirmish, our troops will fire away so much powder; but it was pretty smart skirmishing and has cost us over 100 wounded, though I still believe it was a rear guard covering the movement of trains.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,In the Field, two miles from McGuire's, May 17, 1864-5 p.m.

Brigadier-General GARRARD,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: If it is possible for you to get forward to-night I desire you to do so, in order to cover our right flank in the direction of Rome. There is a brigade of cavalry in our front, with two or three pieces of artillery, which we have been driving back before us, and which, I presume, will go off in the direction of Rome ready to strike our trains in flank unless they are watched closely or driven off.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

GENERAL: Major-General Sherman directs that you make a dash at the railroad to-night between Rome and Kingston, and break up the enemy's communications and prevent him from removing his material of war or using the railroad to concentrate his troops.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major General F. P. BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps, Huntsville:

If you hear that we have taken Rome before your command leaves Huntsville, send to Bridgeport for a steam-boat and have it tow the pontoon bridge now stored at that point, which was thrown across the Tennessee River at Larkinsville Landing, down to Whitesburg. Cross your command at that point and march directly for Rome.

Major-General, Commanding.
