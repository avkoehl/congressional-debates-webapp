APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 24,
35th Cong....2d Sess. Reports of Select Committee on JSlaval Contracts and Expenditures.
Ho. of Reps.
prove any arrangement on the part of an officer of the Gov-
ernment which, under pretense of making contracts for
"supplies, was designed to confer especial and exclusive fa-
vor on individuals, yet, in the contiact entered into in Sep-
tember, 1858, between the Navy Department and W. C. N.
Swift, for the supply of live oak to satd Department, it is
clearly proved by the testimony that tf the Secretary of the
Navy did contemplate any favor to said Swift, he did not
design "to bestow if to the detriment of the Govei nment, but
that in all he did in this matter tic kept always in view the
good of the public and the interests of the service.
4. Resolved, That in the letting of the contracts for the
construction of the &team machinery for the vessels of the
Navy during the present Administration, nothing has been
shown which calls for the interposition of the Congress of
tfre United States-; but it is manifest that the present head
of the Navy Department has displayed a very laudable zeal
to secure the greatest amount of speed and efficiency attain-
able for said vessels,
5. Resolved, That nothing has been proved in this inves-
tigation which impeaches, in any way, the personal or offi-
cial integrity of the Secretary of the Navy.
MINORITY REPORT.
Mr. John Sherman, from the select committee
on naval contracts and expenditures, submitted
the following report:
The undersigned members of the spccial com-
mittee on naval contracts and expenditures beg
leave to report:
That the present organization of the bureaus
in the Navy Department is founded upon the act
of August 31, 1842. Prior to that time work in
the navy-yards, whether for the construction and
improvement of navy-yards and docks, or for the
construction and repairs of vessels, was done un-
der the sanction of a board of Navy commis-
sioners. The amount then expended was com-
paratively small. It 1820 the work in navy-yards
amounted to $65,000; in 1830 it was $180,500-, in
1840 it was $110,250. Prior to 1840 the total ex-
penditures in the purchase, construction, and im-
provement of navy-yards, was £7,023,942 12.
An annual appropriation was also made for the
repairs of vessels, and another for gradual in-
crease and improvement.
Under the act of 1842 expenditures in the navy-
yards have mainly been disbursed under the di-
rection of two bureaus:
1. That of navy-yards and docks, charged
with the construction of, and improvements in,
navy-yards.
2. That of construction, equipment, and re-
pairs, charged with the construction and repairs
of vessels, and with the purchase of fuel, hemp,
and materials for the N&vy.
The following statement will exhibit the ex-
penditures under the direction of these bureaus
since their organization, excepting the special
expenditures for the construction of new vessels:

In pursuing the inquiry ordered by the House,
the attentionof your committee has been chiefly
directed to four distinct items of expenditure:
1. The purchase of fuel for the Navy.
2. The purchase of live-oak timber.
3. The management of the navy-yards, and es-
pecially that'of Brooklyn.
4. Contracts for steam machinery.
The undersigned beg leave to submit the re-
sult of their inquiry upon each of these subjects
separately.
coal agency.
Previous to, and including, the year 1850, fuel
for the use of the Navy was required by law to
be purchased by contract with the lowest bidder,
in the same manner as other materials for the
Navy. By the act of September 28,1850, it was
provided that—
<l In the article of fuel for the Navy,or naval stations and
yards, the Secretary of the Navy shall have power to dis-
criminate and purchase, in such manner as he may deem
proper, that kind of fuel which is best adapted to the pur-
pose for which it is used."
In the exercise of this discretionary power, Mr.
Graham, Secretary of the Navy, appointed Mr.
13. N. Springer, a retired coal merchant of Phila-
delphia, the agent of the Government to purchase
anthracite coal. Upon receiving a requisition for
coal, he went around among the coal dealers, re-
ceived their offers, and took the lowest bid; and
upon its delivery, he or his son was upon the
wharf to see that it was weighed correctly and
shipped in good order. The compensation of the
agent was fixed at five per cent, commission.
In May last, Benjamin Tyson was the coal
agent, and several applications were made to the
Secretary of the Navy for the place. The mode
of purchasing the coal, the selection of the agent,
if needed, and his compensation, were, by the
law, entirely at the discretion of the Secretary.
The coal business had largely increased, so that
the amount annually purchased was, in 1858,
about fifty-five thousand tons, being a larger
amount than in previous years, and the percentage
yielded a larger salary. In May, 1858, some of
the applicants met at Washington, and at a con-
ference with each other and their friends, (among
whom was Hon. J. Glancy Jones,) it was agreed
that Dr. Charles H. Hunter, of Reading, Penn-
sylvania, should be appointed coal agent; arid that
the emoluments of the office should be divided
equally between him, John F. Smith, and J.
Lawrence Getz, warm personal and political
friends of the President, who had contributed
largely to his election. Hunter and Smith were
both applicants for the office of coal agent. Getz
was a member of the Pennsylvania Legislature,
and then and now the editor of the Reading Ga-
zette ; each of the parties above named was exam-
ined by your committee; and also, C. Nichols
Beach, whose connection with the transaction will
hereafter appear.
Mr. Smith testified thathe was in Washington
in May last, and was present when the arrange-
ment for the appointment of Hunter was made.
That some of the applicants and their friends had
a conversation to arrange things amicably if they
could. Finally it was agreed that if the Secretary
would appoint either of them, he should appoint
Dr. Hunter, Mr. Getz, and Mr. Smith. That
the arrangement was communicated to the Hon.
J. Glancy Jones, then a member of this House,
j and that the President also understood that the
I emoluments of the office were to go to the three.
As this was deemed important by the committee,
the witness was examined and reexamined by
different members of the committee as to the
knowledge of the President. He repeated that the
President knew that the three were to divide the
emoluments of the office, and that the parties were
satisfied with the decision; but he knew nothing
about the arrangement, whether one half was to
go to one party, and the other half to the other
two, or not.
Mr. Getz testifies that he was at Washington
at the time, and was informed of the arrangement
for the appointment of Dr. Hunter, and that he
(Getz) was to have one third of the profits. He
agreed to it with a " mental reservation." He
conversed with the President about the appoint-
ment of Dr. Hunter, and the President said to
him, " Mr. Jones urged me to appoint you; but
you are no applicant; I have made up my mind
to appoint Dr. Hunter."
Mr. Beach (C. Nichols) testified that he is a
nephew, by marriage, of the Secretary of the
Navy; that he was on intimate relations with him;
that he was in Washington when the arrange-
ment of the appointment of Dr. Hunter was made;
that he was himself an applicant for the office;
that he conversed with Mr. Jones about it; that
he knew that the emoluments of the office were to
be divided up among these parties; and that it
was a matter of general rumor in Washington
before, and at the time of, the appointment; that
he talked with the Secretary about the appoint-
ment of Dr. Hunter, and that the Secretary in-
formed him that, as the application was a Penn-
sylvania one, he would defer to the wish of the
President.
It is to be remarked that, by law, the Presi-
dent has nothing to do with the purchase of coal.
The only power in the matter is conferred by law
upon the Secretary; yet it appears, from the tes*
timony and the Secretary's admission to Beach,
that the power was yielded to the President.
In pursuance of the arrangement, Dr. Hunter
was appointed coal agent; Smith received the
commission from the Navy Department, took it
to Dr. Hunter at Reading, and narrated to him
, the arrangement, to which Hunter agreed. Getz
subsequently declined to share in the profits, be-
cause, as he says, the arrangement was distaste-
ful to him.
Dr. Hunter had been for years, was then, and
still is, a practicing physician in Reading. He
had never purchased coal for sale; he did not
know its market value, took no pains to ascertain
it; did not purchase any coal for the Government,
or do any act, in the performance of his duty, ex-
cept to sign formal papers sent to him by Tyler,
Stone & Co., certifying that a specific quantity of
coal of the best quality had been duly inspected
and weighed by him, and shipped on board a
named vessel. These papers were sent to the
proper bureau, and aH parties knew, or ought to
have known, that the certificates were false, so far
as relates to his personal knowledge of the facts
certified.
By an understanding between Hunter and Smith,
I the latter was to maice inquiries as to selecting
j coal at Philadelphia, but it is manifest that he did
but little in the execution of this trust. He was
in the omnibus business, and had no connection
with the purchase of coal.
The coal was required at Philadelphia, and was
there delivered on shipboard to the Government.
Neither Hunter nor Smith saw the coal inspected,
weighed, or delivered, and the whole business
was turned over to Tyler, Stone & Co. Mr.
Smith testifies that he took no personal supervi-
sion of the matter, except to see that the best
coals could be had, and depended upon Tyler,
Stone & Co. to inspect the coal. When the Gov-
ernment needed coal, a requisition was sent to
Dr. Hunter, which by him was sent to Tyler,
Stone & Co., who became at once the purchasers
for, and the sellers to, the Government. Tyler,
Stone & Co. and Dr. Hunter fixed the price at
$3 85 per ton. The testimony of many "Witnesses
establishes, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the
market value of such coal as was delivered to the
Government would not exceed $3 50 per ton; and
several respectable dealers would have furnished
the Government at that or a less price, and then
made a profit. The purchases of coal thus made
for the Government by Tyler, Stone & Co., for
the six months, from the 1st July, 1858, to 31st
December, 1858, were about 40,000 tons, at a cost
of $3 85 per ton. The amount of emoluments
received by Dr. Hunter, and divided by him
with Mr. Smith, was, for the same six months,
$7,452 92, or at the rate of $14,905 84 per an-
num. In addition to this direct loss, the mode of
purchase adopted furnished no guarantee against
fraud in the quality or amount of coal which,
when delivered on shipboard, was not inspected
by any officer of the Government.
Your committee have fuinished to the parties
implicated in these transactions every opportu-
nity to explain them. All the parties, exccpt the
President, Secretary of the Navy, and Hon. J.
Glancy Jones, have been examined. The Pres-
ident and the Secretary have been furnished with
