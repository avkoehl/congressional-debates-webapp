Assistant Adjutant-General.]
HDQRS. DEPT. WESTERN VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE, Dublin, December 24, 1863.

Maj. Gen. R. RANSOM, Jr.,Commanding,&c., Camp near Rogersville:

GENERAL: Your letters of the 17th and 20th to Major Stringfellow have been received. Lieutenant-General Longstreet telegraphed me on the 17th that he was commanding you and your troops under authority, as he conceived, of the President. That being the case, of course I can give you no orders. I regret it very much as I have need of your command. I will know in a few days the President's wish and will communicate with you.

I returned night before that from the front, where I expected to meet the enemy. The portion of the enemy's force that came to Greenbrier did not come this side of the river. Averell slipped in by way of Callaghan's and struck the railroad at Salem, doing considerable in haste, and I believe suffered severely in killed, wounded, and captured. The full extent of his loss I have not ascertained.

Very respectfully,&c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
