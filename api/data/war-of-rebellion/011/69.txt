1st. That you would appoint three of its active members most familiar with steamboat and engine building, who would act in concert with this Department and under its direction, and from patriotic motives devote some time and attention for thirty days in purchasing and preparing such means of defense on the Western waters against iron-clad boats as the engineers of this Department may devise.

2nd. Designate one of your most capable and substantial citizens who would accept the temporary appointment of assistant quartermaster, and in that official capacity make such contracts, audit and adjust such accounts, as the Department would authorize in the above business. My object is to bring the energetic, patriotic spirit, and enlightened practical judgment of your city to aid the Government in a matter of great moment, where hours must count and dollars not be squandered.

Please let me know as quickly as possible whether the desire of the Department can be effected, and furnish me with the name of the committee and the person designated to act as assistant quartermaster.

Secretary of War.
