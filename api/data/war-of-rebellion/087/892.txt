movements at other points. The picket-line along Elliott's salient has been extended so as to cover the crater and the piece of artillery thrown in front of the line by the explosion. I think the chief of artillery should be apprised of this fact, as the piece might now be brought in. Colonel Goode reports that Corpl. John b. Mize, Company H, [Ninth Virginia,] and Privates J. J. Johnson and William H. Mathews, Company G, Fifty-ninth Virginia Regiment, deserted to the enemy last night while on picket. He says that three more useless, ignorant, and cowardly men never disgraced the rolls of any regiment.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted; Wise's brigade, wounded 1; Elliott's brigade, wounded, 1; Ransom's brigade, wounded, 1; total, 3 wounded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

COLONEL; In obedience to instructions my command extended to the left yesterday any by 1 o'clock occupied the line of General Hoke. Nothing unusual has been reported. Negro troops are still in front of Gracie's brigade. Colonel Rutledge reported about 1 o'clock last night that the officer in charge of our mine on Colquitt's salient thought that he heard the enemy mining. I referred the matter to Lieutenant Postell, engineer officer. The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Gracie's brigade, wounded, 3. Wise's brigade, wounded, 2, Elliott's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 2. Total, 1 killed, 7 wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

COLONEL: The fire from mortars and artillery was weaker than usual yesterday. The enemy's pickets made quite a demonstration in front of Colonel Goode's line last evening. They seem to be aware of the change of troops on this line, as they called over to our pickets, "Halloo! old Hoke's gone over to the Weldon railroad. When do you expect to open the Weldon railroad? We are 100-days' men. Our time is nearly out, and we are going home. We do not want to fight." They probably obtained their information from the men who deserted from Colonel Goode's picket-line night before last. Another man deserted from Wise's brigade last night-Private Mackowicz, Company A, Forty-sixth Virginia-while on picket. I placed Colonel Rutledge, commanding Ransom's brigade, in arrest last evening for permitting communication between men of his command and the enemy and neglect of duty.
