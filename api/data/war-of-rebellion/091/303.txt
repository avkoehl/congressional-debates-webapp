rumor that the train was captured at Cedar Creek. I have no faith in it at all, and feel sure that the train go thorough all right. The bridge at Edenburg has been burned; also bridge at Mount Jackson. Four men of the Eighty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers were taken yesterday by the First Maryland Cavalry, near my lines.

Respectfully,

O. EDWARDS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

The train alluded to is a train of 220 wagons, under charge of Colonel Woods. I have sent special couriers to Edwards to hold on to large train, 560 wagons, with Colonel Currie, if his news proves to be true. The guard with it is about 2,000 infantry. If the enemy in force hold Sheridan's line of communication, this is too small a guard with so large a train. As soon as the arms for my organized stragglers arrive I can send forward about 4,000 additional infantry. I have no advices direct from front.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
