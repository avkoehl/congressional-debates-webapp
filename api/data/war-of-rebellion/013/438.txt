afternoon, the 27th of June, and crossed the said stream by the Woodbury Bridge. The battle begun the day previous had been renewed near Gaines' farm, where we arrived about 4 o'clock p. m. I immediately formed my brigade in two lines, the Third and Fourth Regiments in front and the First and Second Regiments in the second line.

My line was scarcely formed when the Third Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Brown, was ordered to advance forward into the woods, where a fierce combat was raging. Colonel Brown immediately formed his regiment in line of battle, led in into the woods, and began a rapid fire upon the enemy. As this was the first of my regiments engaged, I will complete my report of it by saying that they were all the time under a galling fire, often a cross-fire, but maintained their ground until near sunset, when the whole line fell back. They had at this time expended (a large majority of the men) their last cartridge -- 60 rounds to the man. It is but justice to say that this regiment bore itself most heroically throughout the entire action. Their conduct was all that could be desired. With their comrades falling around they stood up like a wall of iron, losing over one-third of their number, and gave not and inch of ground until their ammunition was expended and the retrograde movement became general. They were under this fire one hour and a half.

The First Regiment entered the woods about half an hour after the Third, and remained until the close of the action. Colonel Torbert being unwell, the regiment was led by Lieutenant-Colonel McAllister, and well sustained by his presence and courage. I should, however, say that Colonel Torbert, though suffering from low fever, followed us to the field and was present. I take great pleasure in saying -- for both these regiments fought under my own eye - that the First Regiment showed the same indomitable courage as the Third Regiment, exposing themselves to the leaden hail of an often unseen foe, advancing with the Third Regiment, and stood steadily under a most galling fire until the close of the action. Their loss was, enlisted men killed, 20; wounded, 80; missing, 57.

The loss of commissioned officers was 1 killed, 4 wounded and 1 missing; making a total of 163.*

I have now to speak of the Second and Fourth Regiments, the first of which, under Colonel Tucker, numbered only four companies, the other six being on duty on the field works at Camp Lincoln, left behind under Lieutenant-Colonel Buck.

While absent to the front these four companies, by order of General Porter and without my knowledge, were sent into the words, suffering a most galling fire. Their loss was, enlisted men killed, 12; wounded, 45; missing, 40; making a total of 97 enlisted men.* I also regret to of record the death of Colonel I. M. Tucker, and probably Major Ryerson, both of whom were left upon the field; also Captain Danfordh, mortally wounded, and Lieutenant Callan, missing. They, however, sustained themselves most gallantly, and proved their courage against superior numbers.

The fate of the Fourth Regiment, Colonel Simpson - one of my most efficient regiments as regards officers add men - was most painful. At the moment when victory seemed wavering in the balance an aide of General McClellan took them from my command and ordered them into the woods. All the account I can give of them is that by one officer, wounded, and 82 men have rejoined my command. All the rest,
