OFFICE OF COMMISSARY OF FIRST DIST. OF TENNESSEE,

Bristol, October 5, 1864.

Major General John C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state to you that I am the chief purchasing commissary of the First District of Tennessee, under Major W. S. Munday, chief commissary of subsistence of State of Tennessee.

My district begins at the State line between Virginia and Tennessee, and embraces the counties of Hancock, Hawkins, Sullivan, Cartr, Johnson, Washington, and Greene; the adjoining counties of Jefferson, Cocke, and Grainger belongs to another district, but the commissary in charge being assigned to other duty I can extend my operations over them. I would respectfully state to you the resources of these counties. I do so from past knowledge of their capacity and from reliable information of the present crops, &c., in them. From the State line to the Holston and Watauga the wheat crop was short and has been nearly all collected.
