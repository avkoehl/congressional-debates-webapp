HEADQUARTERS,Near Knoxville, Tenn., December 3, 1863.

Major General W. T. MARTIN,

Commanding Cavalry:

In retiring from its present position the army will march via the old stage road and Bean's Station to Rogersville. Two brigades of cavalry will cross the river at Armstrong's Ford to-morrow noon and pass down toward Knoxville and return after night to the vicinity of the ford and bivouac. At early dawn these two brigades will take up the line of march on the south side via New Market, Morristown, and Russellville. The officer in command will report all information of importance to General Law, who will be found between Strawberry Plains and Russellville, and to the commanding general on the stage road to Bean's Station. Two brigades of cavalry will march in rear of the army on its left flank (retiring), and one little in advance of its left flank. The other brigade will take the same road as this army corps as its rear guard. All information at all important will be communicated rapidly to the commanding general, who will be found somewhere near the rear division. In case the cavalry on the flanks hear firing in the rear of the column, the commanders will at once communicate with the column and ascertain if it is necessary that they should close in upon the flanks for co-operation. The cavalry commanders will have all beef-cattle that may be found in the country through which they pass collected and driven to the road over which the column will pass.

By command of Lieutenant-General Longstreet:

HEADQUARTERS,Near Knoxville, December 3, 1863.

Colonel HART,

Commanding:

You will start your artillery off to report to General Martin, near the late Colonel Scott's house, between the Maynardville and Morristown roads. The company will collect forage for their animals upon the road and report to General Martin as early as practicable. You will also send a small guard with the battery. You will withdraw your cavalry from Kingston and the cavalry near Loudon at dark to-morrow night. You will march the two commands (uniting them at some convenient point) up the Clinch River by the most practicable route and report by letter or messenger to General Martin. General Martin will march before daylight on the 5th for Bean's Station, taking the road that runs nearest the Clinch River for his route, and you will so time your march from Kingston to-morrow night as to be able to put yourself in communication with General Martin on the same route by daylight on the 5th. You will then receive all of your orders from General Martin.

By command of Lieutenant-General Longstreet:

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
