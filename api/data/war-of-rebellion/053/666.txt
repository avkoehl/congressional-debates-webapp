Major-General WHEELER,

KINLOCH FALCONER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HILL'S CORPS,Anderson's House, September 18, 1863-8.40 p.m.

General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

Owens' Ford was lost to-day. Armstrong is now picketing with some 60 men from Childress' Ford to Glass' Mil, a distance of 2 1/2 miles. Lieutenant-General Hill begs you will relieve him with your cavalry to-morrow morning, as he does not wish to scatter Breckinridge's division, which should be concentrated at Glass' Mill.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,One Mile from Anderson's, September 18, 1863.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: I have just seen General Bragg, and he directs that all my command should be used to guard the left flank of the army, and it will therefore be impossible for me to relieve General Armstrong's brigade. This will, I think, only be necessary until the position of the enemy is more fully developed.

Colonel Wheeler, who now commands General Armstrong's brigade is making arrangements to send more cavalry to your front. General Bragg states that General Hill will be up in time to prevent any gaps between your line and his.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

JOS. WHEELER,

Major-General.
