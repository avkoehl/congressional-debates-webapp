to an implied threat There was no obligation to
consider the language as conveying any such
threat or menace
He should not have admi'led the rule of public
law in such a decided and explicit manner Nei-
ther honor ror manly frankness required hm to
express any doubt upon a point of international
Uw which was sustained by every principle of
sound reason, and by every modern writer on the
law of nations.
He should have abstained from sending the At-
torney General to the State of New York to per-
form the acts specified in his instructions
And what were those acts? To furnish McLeod
with the evidence of the recognition of his act by
his own Government. This was just The British
Government had no communication with the au-
thorities of the State of New York Their ayow-
al was to the Government of the United States.
No principle cf puhhc policy can overrule the
great principle of justice, which demanded of this
Government that they should not withhold from
an individual arraigned for murder evidence in its
possession which he deemed essential for his de-
fence. The Attorney General was to see that
McLeod had able counsel Was it derogatory to
the character of th"? Government, or evidence of
fear, that it was desirous that an individual, whose
discharge had been demanded of it, under the law
of nations, should have the benefit of skilful legal
advisers? Was it the opposite of American spirit
and energy, that the Government of ihe united
States should wish, under such circumstances, that
the individual who could not be released from con-
finement under judicial process o herwise than by
judicial process, and in a manner conformable to
legal principles, and course of practice in courts
of justice, shonid enjoy the advantage of profes-
sional men to aid him in their judicial proceedings'
Tne Attorney General was to suggest to the coun-
sel for the prisoner that the President was impress-
ed with the propriety of transferring the trial from
the scene ot the principal excitement to some other
and distant county Appealed to as the President
had been for the release ot McLeod, was it strange
that he should be anxious that he should have a
fair and impartial trial* Is this anxiety the result
of fear of the power of Great Britain' Does it
manifest a disposition to yield to threats and me-
naces? Is it discreditable to the American cha-
racter that i s Chief Magistrate should wish that
justice should be fairly and impartially adminis-
tered' The Attorn-y General was to signify the
wish of this Govemm.nt that a writ of error
should be brought from the decision of the court of
the State of Ne n York to the Supreme Court of
the United States, jf that decision was adverse to
the immunity claimed by the prisoner under the
law of nations How proper and suitable was the
course thus proposed to be taken The Govern-
ment of the Uiited States, alone responsible (if
responsible at al ) to foreign Governments for any
infraction of public law, was desirous of having
the opinion of usown judicial tribunal upon the
question of such infraction, shou'd it become ne-
cessary by the adjudication of the State court
Surely, the manifestation of such a desire was very
far from evincing a spirit of servile fear, or the
want of proper energy It v/as intended to ex-
press the opi ion oi tne Piesident, that tne prisoner
was entitled to t*e opinion of the Supreme Cour',
if necessary, and that the Executive deemed it
proper that such opinion should be obtained m the
form prescribed by law Now, I inquire whether
in auy of these proceedings considered separately,
or in all conjointly, there is manifesté i any thing
except an ardent desire that this Governm n.
should act justly and pertorm its duty according to
the acknowledged principles of international law?
And yet the late President, the pretent President,
and every Heid of Department, stand charged
with being want.ngin energy, as not evincing an
American spirit, and acting in a manner discredita-
ble to the American character.
Mr President, the American people will cast no
such stigma upon the character of the illustrious
de«w, or the honored living. This reproach will be
repudiated by the great body of the freemen fo
this nation.   This magnanimous people will con-
tinue to be, as they ever have been, just to all
nations, but jealous of their own honor, and ever
ready to Vint icate their rights Instead of treat-
ing an unauthorized invasion of their territory as
the wanton, lawless act of an obscure individual,
and looking to his execution as a malefactor as a
reparation ñ r the insulted honor of the country,
they will held the nation which avows it—the
principal m the act—the nation by whose ord r
and under whose authority it was done—responsi-
ble And while such an individual as now ñ'ls
the Executive chair is their President—while such
men as now constitute his Cabinet are his ct nstitu-
tional advisers—while a Congress exist  which
knows what are the rights of the ration, and know
nag, will sustain and defend them, this ¡ reat na
tion will hold the authors of wrongs done to her, to
a just responsibility, and maintain her integrity,
her honor, and her right, unsullied and unim
paired.
SPEECH OF MR. DEAN,
OF OHIO
Jn the House of Representatives, Aug 5, 1841—On
the bill to incorporate the subscribers to the Fis-
cal Bank of the United States.
Mr. Chairman. The subject now before the
committee is one in which my constituents take a
deep interest They feel, sir, that in this matter
the Legislature is transcending its constitutional
bounds, not for the purpose of correcting existing
evils, and relieving the people from oppressun,
but for the purpose of building up a moneyed mo-
nopoly, armed wiih such power as will enable it
to set the wholesome restraints of the law at defi
anee, and, instead of restoring confidence, and
healing the dissensions which now afflict us, will
be a fire-brai d thrown in our midst, to light up
the match that will set on flame, and blow into
deadly sinfe, all the political elements of this, coun
try. Sir, I should feel myself recreant to my duty,
and unworthy the confidence of my constituents,
were I to remain passive, and see this worst of all
measures fastened upon my country.
The time has now arrived when forbearance is
no longer a v irtue—when it becomes the duty of
every freeman, who is not willing to bow h s neck
submissively io the yoke oí oppres ion, to tend
forth, and bo'dly and manfully resist those high
handed measures, which are calculated to bring
this mighty people, manacled, and in humble sub
mission, to the footstool of the moneyed power.
Sir, the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania
who reported this bill, has gravely íniormed us
that the consii utionality of this question has long
since been  c lied by legisative and judicial de-
cision , and t lat it now only remains for us to de-
termine upon its expediency 1 beg leave to differ
entirely from that gentleman, and if I mistake rot
the spirit  nd intelligence of the American people,
this question will never be settleduntil tneBank par-
ty,whose broad construction of the Constitution ena-
bles ihem to seize upon any power which their
ambition or interest maj prompt them to, shall
cease to claim it as a constitutional right, ind give
up all pretensims to create saeh an institution
Then, and not until then, will this question be
settled
Most of our distinguished statesman have, at
different per ods. been found upon bo'h s ^es of
this question They have made the C3-stitufion
yield to their notions of expediency, and instead of
giving it its plain, palpable import and meaning,
Ueyl.-'ve m mlded it like a hail of wax, to suit
their o i n peculiar notions, and to meet tee exieen-
cies i  ihe tu íes
But, sir, th >ie was one man among the illustri-
ous states i'  oí our country, more eminent than
all the rest, iml whose knowledge of constitution
al law waseqjal, if not super or.'o any of that day
I mean tht immortal Jefferson He neve had
but one opmi 11 on this question He ilv. « s hela
that Congress ¡art no constitutional po*er io ere
ate a bank c irporation, and hi> profound political
knowledge a id thorough acquaintance with the
history of oui institutions and the gemus- of oar
Government,  ntit'e him Ij our utriost confidence
The politician and statesman may follow him
with perfect safety as the polar star and guide for
all their political acicns. His warning voice, ad-
monishing us against ihe danger oí creating this
mone) ed n onster, should not be heaid avaiB
Yes, sir, h s memorable saying on this subject
shoti'dnn only be wri'ten in letters of gold and
place i i po i our family altars, among ourhetuse-
hold go is, )ut they -hould be impressed upó  the
heart (f evi ry freeman ot this nation But the
Consiituno i no where confers upon Congress the
power to create charters e>f incorporation, and no
incidental >r constructive power can be inferred,
unless it be indispensable necessary, to carry in ex-
ecution, some of the specially delegated powers.
Is it indis iensably necessary, then, to create a
bank corpiraton for the purpose of aiding Con-
gress in carrying into exeaution the power "to lay
and collect taxes, &c. To pay the debts, and pro-
vide for th^ common defence and general welfare
of the nation. To regulate commerce &c. and to
coin money, and to regula'e the value thereof,"
&c ? Tfaest are the delegated powers which the
Constitutio i has conferred upon Congress, and
from which the latitudinanan and broad construc-
tionist infer the right to create a bank corporation,
because they say that a bank is necessary and pro-
per to carry into execution some of the foregoing
delegated powers. But sir, I am unable to discover
in what minner a bank can be necessary and pro-
per to aid the Government in executing any of
these powe s; and until I hear better reasons than
any that have yet been offered, I can never give it
my approbation The Supreme Court decided that
the old United States Bank was constitutional, on
the ground that Congress was the sole judge of
what laws were necessary and pioper to carry
into effect the delegated powers conferred upon
them by the Cons ltution. They put the canstitu-
tionahty of this question, upon ¡he ground that Con*
gre^s had f< und the fac, that a bank w«.s "necessa-
ry and proper" to carry into execution some of
the deiegdt d powers and therefore constitutional.
Now, sir, this fact is what I deny, and unless
it can be c'early shown that this Government can 
not fully excise ail its rights,and execute all its
delegated oi wers without,the aid of a bank, it mus. be
admitted that i s creation would not be warranted
i > ilu Coi utution Now, sir, our experience has
te ted this fact, and we do know that the affairs of
this Government have been better conducted with-
out the aid of a Bank, than with one. I am, sir,
opposed to the exercise of any implied power, un-
less the ex fress nower cannot be fairly and fully
exerci ed without ir, and unless the implied power is
indispensably necessary io carry out the express
power, as fur instance, the power to raise an army
would imply the dower to pay them a fair compen-
sation But the flower to levy and collect taxes,
to pay the debts and provide for the defence and
general welfare of the nation, or to com money or
to regulate commerce, in ply no power to incorpo-
rate a Bank, and if we cin, by a forced cohstruc-
tion of the Constitution, imply this power, I know
of none withm the whole ran e of absolute despo-
tism that we may not ex< rcise under the pretence
that i* is nece-sary ind proper; but it is admitted
by all tha* ihts is a Governme rt of limited powers,
and that we have no right to gi beyond the bounds
of the Corstitution; when, therefore, the power
sought to b- exercised is at al toubtful, we should
go back to ihe histoiy, of ¡h_t convention wh ch
framed the Co'stuution, and a'cenam, if we can,
what were their visws and opinions upon ti e
question at that time, and I find, sir, m the
journals of the proceedings of «at convention
which formed the Constitution, a proposnion spe-
cially brought before that body to embrace
in tne Constitution, and confer upon Congress
the power to create incorporations, was there pre-
sented <íi d fully argued, and rejected by a vote of
that couvcntion, and th-reby expressly refusing to
confer upon Congress the power to create incorpo-
rations, and yet it is gravely contended that Con-
gress may exereise, by construction, a power which
the eonve ition that formed the Constitution ex-
prés, ly ref ised to confer upon them But I will,
for fe more full and complete understanding ot
this subject, let the journals speak for themselves
