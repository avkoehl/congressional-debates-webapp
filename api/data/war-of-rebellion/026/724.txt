General DIX:

The papers do our cause almost as much harm as the rebel armies. Hooker's moves were all read in the papers long before the hour for Lee to strike, and he knew both sides of the game.

Wentz commenced as he did to save time. He has not reported this morning, but I believe I will transfer the work at dark.

A deserter says between 20,000 and 30,000 on Blackwater under Longstreet. Have not believed it.

To carry on the movement without losing time and opportunity I ought to have the re-enforcements by rail or otherwise at Core Creek to-morrow afternoon or evening; the earlier, the more time for the men to rest and sleep. I contemplate moving from Core Creek about 10 p. m., so as to reach my position just before daylight.

I might effect our object with two regiments, but to guard against possibilities I wish six; also three companies of cavalry, two pieces of artillery (though the artillery is not likely to be used), and the men had better have three days' rations. For cavalry I should prefer Pond's company and Jacob's, who have been with me before; and I shall take Wilson's (now the line) for the third.

As regards your suggestion respecting the Trent road I shall carry it out by ordering one of the cavalry companies now on that end of the line, or both, with two companies of the infantry now there, to make a
