ttonal compact, continued "Ir Pope, whethei of   people m
the alégate, or by the fetales, in their  ovcif i„u toipoiate ca
pacuies, ought to receive, especially m ii/Mid to poweis and
subjects to which theState  art, not compe cut a f m m 11 ition

The Conservative filends, he said  wiw r irdon him, while
ha admired then manly independence, to say   with ¿teat de
ference to their intelligence, tha   deciding to his lefleotionson
the subject of commeice and. money, they aie only half ught
We agree, (said Mr Pope,) il Iundeistaml them, ihuaue^clu

country; and that om social and commercnl in eicourse and

I put the question, t.aid he, f  the ctndoi and intelligence of
those gentlemen and all otlioi gentlemc i o i tin íi i n, whethei,
according to the divisions ot power f ^at lis n-1 between the
State and National Government, that milium ought not to

Commerce and cuirenty aie certainly placed by the Consti-
tution within ihesphere of national legislation, and tiio yapei
medium or bank money representative ought to be issued by a
national bank of universal credit md conhdetice, and on ,t
fjundationas him as the Governmentitself
It is etenaal -nidMc Pope, thu any papei sub tttntc foi

Uble into specie every what e, must have j nat  mil clmacter,
and 1 noW put it to gentlemen, coutiuued Mi Pope, to mow r
whether it is possible to m ike themtes of the ha tits of twenty
six States cuntnt ovei y wheie, and constitute a unifoim and

Government to n inonahzf the notes of ill these h inks, ho v

SPEECH OF MR. CROCKETT,
Of Tennessee,
In the House of Rem esentatives, October 5,1837—On the bill
authoitztngan issue of Ireasury notes
Mi Speaker. I hi pe, sir, the House will not think me im
peitinent ot obtrusive when Lask their mlulgence, but for a
few moments to submit some few remaiks in justification of
the vote which I feel it to be my duty to give upon the bill now
undei consideration Aft t so much has been said upon this
subject, eithei d íecily oi indncctly, pei haps I may not hope,
sir, to cast any new IiJdit upon it, oi to plat e H in any point of
view in which it has not already been con«ideted But when I
considei the pledges I am undei to my constituents id the vei y
extiaoidmary courseof measurcswhich his been lecom mended
by tliG Administiauou, I cannot ptimi this occasion to pa&s
without at least making a geneial e ipot>e of my view* in order
that my constituents and the country m iy see upon which side
of the lt fence" 1 stand m i elation to these great and impoitant
questions
Sir, I was one of those who used all honoiable means to pie
vent the election of the present Clnet Magistrate of this nation
10 tin h imguiohed and exaltedstation which he now occupies
But, sn I do not enteitam any bitterness of leelmg towards the
President uoi did I come heie as a represent itive of the people
deteimined t j oppose his \dminiv. ration, right oi wtong, or to
tbiow oh tacios in th way of it  success O i the contiary if

to me that we have before our eyes the most incontestable cvt
dence of the deepest pecuniary 4istrcss and embanassment in
eveiy quartei of this Union    ho fai as I have heaid, no section
is exempt, save the thstnetof the honorable gentleman fiom

sir, a1 tho ugh this increased state   I embauasstnent i i the (lecu

tem ol mcisiucs his been leconimended anrl has been brougl t
forward by the Committee of Ways and Means, all having in
view but one single obticl— he relief of the Government
With this view, su it w pioposed bv the bill now undet con
sideration to clothe th-1 President of ihe Un ted -states with au
thorny toeau e tobe i sued ten millions of dollars in Tre isu
rynotes, to meet the cxizenciesof the Freasmy tnd foi the le

leplemshed so that the office hoh'ero may get their pay But
the distress and embairassment of the community seems to he
a mattei of minor impoitanc   ind of hut h tie cone rrd
Sir, it has been uiged by honoiable gentlemen that this ig a
measure of relief to the country, that it will supply the country
With a ciicidation and a medium ofe^e^ansre, and I si an* that
it might oiler some temporary relief but ?ir I believe it would
tend, ultimately, to Aggravate the disease So fir fiom ben g a
measure of permanent relief to the peo¡ te I believe it is the
enteimg wedge to an institution almost a o (bouts as the Spa
ntsh Inquisition I mean, sir, a Tie isury bank In fací, if the
amendment of tho honorable «endaman from South Caiuhna
(Mr Rhett) be adopted, a Treasury bank of i^sue and deposite
is at once established
Sir, instead of showing any disp>siuon to grant relief to the
people we are called upon to increase their burdens We are
about to h* ap upon them another national debt, (for disguise if
as you will it is nothing less, and has been so admitted on all
«ides) to the amount of ten millions oi dollars to relieve the
Government, while the people are told, substantially, that they
need not expect any relief, that it is the business of the Govern
ment to takecaieof UseK, and that it has nopowei tomtermed
die with the concerns of individuals' The Government, after
having tampared with the currency until it is rumed and anm-
