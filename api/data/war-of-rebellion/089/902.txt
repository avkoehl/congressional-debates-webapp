HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 9, 1864-2.10 p.m. (Sent 2.15 p.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Yours of 1.30 p.m. received and reported arrangements satisfactory, except I would send either Wheaton or Gibbon out to the point indicated in my last dispatch. I forward a telegram, just received from the lieutenant-general commanding, for your information.* I think it will take all day for Miles to see what can be found out, and if he cannot get any information by that time, and is undisturbed, I will be in favor of withdrawing him. Parke has been directed to concentrate his Third Division (4,000) on the Jerusalem plank road.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864-2.20 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

I have ordered Miles to remain at Hatcher's Run and send forward the cavalry, with small support of infantry; cautioned him again about his right and the Duncan road, and informed him Wheaton was ordered up to vicinity of Tucker's to co-operate with him and keep open the road. I will go out myself with or in advance of Wheaton, unless you think I had better remain here until further developments. Wheaton will stop at my headquarters on his way out.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864-2.55 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Dispatch of 2.10 received. I had ordered Gibbon to move to vicinity of Tucker's, but on referring to your dispatch of 10.30 I thought it best to send Wheaton instead. The differences of distance in the two marches is about a mile. In the event of my receiving any report from Miles that the enemy are approaching n force on his right flank I will move Gibbon out past Fort Cummings, Claypole's, &amp;c.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 9, 1864-3.15 p.m. (Sent 3.25 p.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I see no objection to your going with Wheaton if you desire to, except the difficulty of communicating with you in an emergency; but as the emergency is likely to be where you will be, you can act without delay.
