Assistant Adjutant-General.

[CHATTANOOGA,] October 14, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN,

Athens, Ala.:

The One hundred and fifteenth Illinois Volunteers have fallen back on Ringgold. Colonel Potect reports Dalton surrendered after four hours' fighting. All forces this side are ordered to fall back in this place as fast as menaced by heavy forces. Reports regarding the enemy very conflicting. From all I can learn I do not think he will move on this place but is using a large force to destroy the road. Please answer when you will be here.

Respectfully,

S. B. MOE,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

OCTOBER 14, 1864.

Colonel HAYS,

Ringgold:

You will not risk the capture of your command. Keep the cavalry you have well out and use your own judgment from the information they give you when to fall back to this place.

By command, &amp;c.:

S. B. MOE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GRAYSVILLE, October 14, 1864.

General STEEDMAN:

Hood is in possession of Ringgold with one corps. Colonel Hays evacuated that place. I will fall back on Chattanooga immediately.

Major S. B. MOE:

Major Seventh Kentucky Cavalry.
