I am well fortified, and intend to fight it out on this line. Last Thursday, as I wa coming from Cassville, with at train and 170 men, I was attacked by 500 rebels under Brown, and repulsed them after two hours' severe fighting near Bentonville. Brooks, with 700 men, was also watching the road fifteen miles south, near Cross Hollows, but I made a flank movement, and brought my train off in safety. I have subsistence for a thirty-days' siege, if they wish to try me as long as that. Price is at Kansas City, hemmed in by the troops of Curtis, Blunt, Rosecrans, Pleasonton, McNeil, Sanborn, and Brown. They fought him on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday (21st, 22nd, and 23d), and defeated him in each battle. If he escapes at all it will be in such a demoralized condition that he can do us no harm. Price marched from Pilot Knob (where he was repulsed by Ewing) to Franklin; tore up most of the southwest branch railroad; burnt bridges; marched up main branch to Jefferson, destroying railroad and robbing the country; attacked Jefferson; was repulsed by A. J. Smith's veterans; passed on to Sedalia, Boonville, and Lexington, thence to Kansas City, and had started south, but had to halt and turn back, as his retreat had been cut off. Telegraphic report from Saint Louis up to noon yesterday says Price's army is being dissolved like mist in the sun; if his army is not annihilated will have to escape in small bands. Deserters by hundreds are coming into our lines. Longstreet has superseded Early. Sheridan had whipped Early four times, and he has just now given Longstreet a terrific defeat. Heavy administration gains in all States. Lincoln will get the greatest majority ever heard of. Gold, 211. Sherman is after Hood, and giving him great trouble. Grant has driven the rebel fleet from James River, and has his point of attack on Richmond clear. Expect good news soon. Telegraph open from Saint Louis to Cassville. If you want the latest news send to me. I expect to keep this line open.

Price is again retreating by Harrisonville, Kansas, and Granby roads, and is likely to pass near Neosho. On the 24th our forces were near Little Santa Fe, and Price was ten miles south. Our troops have had considerable fighting, and have whipped and driven the enemy and captured two guns.

Major-General DANA,

Vicksburg:

GENERAL: One colored regiment is now at Saint Charles and a second goes there to-morrow; the other regiment will return to Vicksburg, I have also left at Saint Charles a section of artillery and two mounted companies. It is an important point and should be held. The camping-ground is very good and there are huts for the men. I started yesterday p. m., per steamer, a party of 200 mounted men to land at Gaines' Landing, &amp;c. Have not yet had time to hear from them.
