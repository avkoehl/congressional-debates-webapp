RICHMOND VA., May 15, 1867.

Bvt. Major General E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that, pursuant to instructions from the President of the United States, under date of May 8, 1867, I obeyed the writ issued by the U. S. circuit court, in session in this city, under date of May 1, 1867, to produce before said court on the second Monday of May, 1867, the body of Jefferson Davis, a prisoner in my custody at Fort Monroe, Va., and that on that day (the 13th instant) I was released from further custody of the prisoner Jefferson Davis by the Honorable John Underwood, district judge.

A copy of said writ and of my return is herewith inclosed.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. S. BURTON,

Colonel Fifth Artillery, Brevet Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

[Indorsement.]

ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, May 16, 1867.

Respectfully submitted to the Secretary of War.

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Abstract from monthly returns of the principal U. S. military prisons.

[NOTE.- The returns from which this abstract is compiled were furnished to the Commissary-General of Prisoners in compliance with circular of July 7, 1862, for which see Vol. IV, this series, page 152. Prior to the issue of said circular, separate and specific returns of prisoners were not required by the regulations of the War Department. Even during the period covered by this abstract prisoners other than those herein embraced were held in the custody of provost-marshals, incarcerated in civil prisons or treated in hospitals, of whom no returns were rendered. The following tables, therefore, afford only a partial exhibit of the number of prisoners held by the U. S. authorities. For the same reason the deaths and other changes among the prisoners so held are not fully presented. The 'sick" and "citizens" under the head of "memoranda" are included in the other columns. Some of the returns used in the compilation do not distinguish between ordinary prisoners of war and citizens held in confinement.]
