urged on their consideration. Negotiations with the enemy have recently been in progress with the view of effecting a general exchange of prisoners. They are not yet entirely completed, and to avoid further delay in submitting this report they will be presented in a separate communication. *

The attention of Congress is respectfully invoked to the absolute necessity of an augmentation in the clerical force in the Department. The undersigned and the chiefs of bureaus are compelled to extend their labors beyond reasonable limits; the clerks have been directed to attend at their desks two additional hours in the evening, and yet the details of business have accumulated with such rapidity that the accounts of disbursing officers to the amount of many hundreds remain unsettled, and correspondence is an arrears in all the bureaus. I solicit that there be an increase of twenty clerks, to be divided among the seven bureaus in such proportion as may be found most advantageous by the head of the Department, of whom six should have salaries of $1,500 a year, six at $1,200 a year, and the remainder at $1,000 a year. A glance through the rooms of the War Department will satisfy any observer that this addition is the least that can enable the officers to perform the public business with accuracy and dispatch.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.
