Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: In reply to your inquiry in regard to the discrepancy existing between my report of the wounded in the Second Division, of the Fourteenth Corps, and the report received from the surgeons, I have the honor to inclose a later report made by General Davis from date obtained yesterday, and to state as follows:

It will be seen from this report, taken one day later than the former one, that the number of wounded varies only 7 from the first report, the first stating 632 and the latter 625, an evidence that care has been taken in both. The later report from the surgeons gives an increase in the number of wounded from 397 to 473. this indicates that there may be further inaccuracies. A few men are probably treated in the hospitals for slight wounds who leave the hospitals before their names are taken. Other men, slightly wounded, are treated by the surgeons on the field and never go to the hospitals. Others, desperately wounded, leave their commands and die without ever reaching the hospitals. General Davis' report can be relied upon as nearly correct.

Very respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General, Commanding.
