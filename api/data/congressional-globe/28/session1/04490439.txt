er, the commission merchant, and the consigner,
especially in a depressed state of the money market.
This would be relieved by a "warehousing sys-
tem." * In addition to this, it would form a depot of
supplies, and render valuable aid to our carrying
trade. Time will not allow me, at present, to enter
at large into this subject; but as it is in the hands
of my colleague, who, I trust, will bring it forward
at his earliest opportunity, I will wait that time to
give my views more at large upon this subject.
REMARKS OF MR. RATHBUN,
OF NEW YORK,
In the- House of Representatives, J\Iay 7, 1844—On
the tariff.
Mr. RATHBUN said: 1 have listened to the dis-
cussion of the bill now under consideration, for sev-
eral days, desirous of obtaining some new light on
the subject, that I might derive benefit from the
experience and research of those who are better ac-
quainted with the merits and working of the tariff
system than myself. A large number of those who
have addressed the committee, have hardly alluded
to the tariff, and many on the other side of the
House, who have touched the question, have done
so in too much of the partisan spirit, to reach the
judgment and understanding of any one, not of their
faith. I need hardly add, that my views remain
unchanged. I regret that this subject should have
been, in any degree, intermingled with party feeling.
It is a question so important, so deeply interesting,
so exciting, that, in my humble judgment, it de-
serves the most calm, unprejudiced, and deliberate
consideration. "When we reflect that this vast
country, embracing almost every variety of soil
and climate on the globe, producing a vast variety of
agricultural and mineral products, its various and
extended manufacturing, mechanic, and commercial
interests, are all to be governed by the same laws,
we cannot fail to discover the difficulties which sur-
round us. In one portion of the country, high pro-
tective duties are supposed to be necessary for the
success of manufactures. In another portion
of the country, where there are few manufactures,
the doctrine of protection is unpopular, because it is
supposed to be unjust and oppressive upon the peo-
ple in that section. And again, there are certain
other portions of the country, embracing a part of
New England—T may also include a part r f New
York, and several of the western States—principally
agricultural, which, in some respects, occupy a me-
dium ground upon the tariff question; neither ultra
for or against a protective tariff. The people of
this latter portion of our country approve of a tariff
which shall produce a revenue sufficient to defray
the expenses of the government, economically ad-
ministered; and they are in favor of such discrimi-
nations in levying the duties, as shall sccure the de-
sired amount of revenue, and, at the same time,
place all the products of the soil, and labor of the
country, on such a footing that they shall not be
borne down by foreign competition.
They are not m favor of prohibitory duties, be-
cause thev know that the government must have
revenue; and that if sufficient revenue is not thus
collected, resort must be had to direct taxation to
supply the deficiency. Sn, the people know, as well
as we do, the consequences of prohibiting the impor-
tation of foreign goods by extravagant duties.
They know that, as a general rule, it operates as a
tax upon the consumer, without furnishing revenue
for the government, or any equivalent to them; and
that it is paving the way for direct taxation. If we
could all divest ourselves of party prejudices upon
this question, and adjust it rightly and in a spirit of
concession and compromise—if we could look to
the good of the whole people instead of the good of
party,—this vexed and exciting question might bo
peinmnently settled. I honestly believe that any
system, not radically defective, not palpably un-
just, if permanent, is better for the country than the
continued change and fluctuation to which we are
now subjected. We have been repeatedly asked,
"why disturb the peesent ''The people (say
its advocates) do not desire it; nobody asks it;
thousands have remonstrated against it.1' I an-
swer for myself, that I came here pledged to my
constituents to do all in my power to modify and
amend the tariff law of 1842—not to destroy it; to
equalize its burdens and benefits as near as possi-
ble. I came here pledged to support and protect
the agriculturist, the mechanic, and the laborer,
to put them upon an equality with the manufacturer,
if I could do so. Sir, are there not upon this floor
at least one hundred and twenty members sent here
by their constituents for the same purpose and under
the same pledges? We came here to perform cer-
tain specified duties—to correct the errors, and right
the wrongs, of our predecessors. Why, then, should
our constituents petition us to perform our pledges,
to discharge our duties? Are we not bound to make
a faithful effort to execute the known will of the
people, without waiting for petitions respecting that
will? Sir, this law was passed by the votes of those
who avowed their intention to correct it upon the
very first opportunity. Shall they redeem that
pledge? Whence and wherefore these remonstan-
ces? Are they not from the manufacturers, and in
response to orders from a portion of this House?
The farmers and mechanics have no agents here but
tjieir representatives. Your lobby is thronged with
the representatives and agents of the manufacturers.
We are m an atmosphere contaminated with the selfish
and presumptuous assertions of a class who cry''Pro-
tection! protection to American industry against the
pauper labor of Europe!'1 to frighten us from the per-
formance of our duty, to prevent the correction of
abuses, and to perpetuate the present partial and
unequal advantages which they enjoy at the ex-
pense of the more numerous classes of their fellow-
citizens.
Sir, I call upon this committee to remember now,
and at all times, that the first, the most numerous
class of our people—that class upon which all others
depend, and without which they cannot exist—is
the cultivators of the soil. If protection is due to
any portion of the people, it is to them. Sir, we
have often heard it proclaimed during this discus-
sion, "that the country is thriving and prosper-
ous," that business is reviving, and this prosperity
is attributed to the tariff of 1842. I ask gentlemen
of the other side of the House, where is the ev-
idence of that prosperity? Is it found in your
prices current of the farmer's products? f have before
me the price in New York, of the second of this
present month. I find wheat quoted at one dollar
a bushel; corn 48 cents; oats from 28 to 30 cents;
beef, (mess,) perbarrel$6;primedo.$4;pork, (mess,)
$9 25; prime $7 25; lard 5; cents per pound; but-
ter from 8 to 13 cents; cheese 4^ cc-nts. Are these the
evidences of the good times? Are these remunera-
ting prices for the labor and capital of the farmer?
Deduct the cost and expense of transportation, in-
spection, &c., and what do you leave the farmer* Sir,
m the district which 1 have the honor to represent,
these articles are the principal dependence of the
farmer. And I tell gentlemen that they may boast
of good times as loud and as long as they please; but
my constituents will judge for themselves, when
their produce brings a fair price. Wheat, at less than
a dollar a bushel, is not a profitable crop. If any
gentleman doubts it, let him go home and follow the
plough, as I have done, and raise and sell a crop,
and then answer me if the farmer is prospering when
he sells his wheat for seventy-five or eighty-seven
and a half cents a bushel? How is it with the farm-
er of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois, who can obtain
only from fifty to sixty cents for his wheat? Will
he believe that the times are prosperous? Will he
be content with mere boasting of good times as a
compensation for his labor5 Several gentlemen on
the other side have asserted that all the suffering
and calamities of business and the country, were
produced by the want of a tariff m 1840 and 1841;
and that "the reduction of the duties under the
compromise tariff of 1833, produced not only a di-
minution of revenue, but also of importations."
First, is it true that the sufferings of the country
were produced m 1840 and 1841, by the want of
adequate tariff duties. Sir, gentlemen seem to be
troubled with bad memories. Have they forgotten
the crisis of 1837^ Have they forgotten the causes
which produced that crisis? if they have, the peo-
ple have not. From 1831 to 1839 we had a high
tariff, and what was the consequence? The follow-
ing table, copied from the report of the Secretary of
the Treasury, exhibits the true condition of things,
and clearly indicates the ruin in prospect:

Sir, is not this excess of imports, amounting to
$236,278,606 at least a part of the evidence to
show whence came the ruin so eloquently described
by gentlemen on the other side. But it is only a
part. I now call their attention to another point,
and I desire them to note it particularly. It is to
the expansion of the currency from 1834 to 1839,
and its contraction from that time to 1841. Thie
table in my hand taken from authentic documents,
presents the following results:
Years. Circulation. '

1840 ....... 110,572,790
1841 115,905,342
Increase of paper money in circulation from 1831
to 1837, Over $50,000,000; falling off in 1838,
033,000,000; increase In 1839 over $19,000,000. Sir,
this is only a part of my evidence upon this point.
Let us now look at the loans and discounts from
1830 to 1837, and see what they prove; and again I
refer to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
This is his statement:
Loans and discounts in 1830 - - f.200,451,214
Do do 1834 - - 324,119,499
Do do 1835 - - 365,163,834;
Do do 1836 - - 457,506,080
Do do 1837 - - 525,115,702
Here we have an increase of loans and discounts
from 1830 to 1837, amounting to almost $325,000,-
000. Sir, this increase of debt was to the banks~
alone. Then we had a high protective tariff. But
I have not yet closed my evidence on this point.
From the same document I read again. Here is a
statement showing the increase of banking capital:
In the year 1830 it was - - §145,192,268
Do 1834 " - - 200,005,944
Do 1835 " - - 231,250,337
Do 1836 " - - 251,875,292
Do 1837 " - - 290,772,091
Increase in seven years, of the. banking capital of
the country, $145,500,000. Sir, I might safely rest
here; but I will remind gentlemen of the debts of the
States and corporate cities existing in 1837, amount-
ing, in the aggregate, to $235,000,000. If it were
possible to ascertain the amount of the debts of pri-
vate individuals existing at that time, independent
of all these, nursed Into being by the credit system,
I have no doubt it would show hundreds of millions
of dollars.
"We are told now, notwithstanding all these re-
corded and well-remembered facts, that it was the
want of a tariff that ruined the country. Why do
gentlemen seek to impose upon the people in this
manner? Sir, I will tell you why. The credit sys-
tem; the increase of banking capital, ofbank circula-
tion; enormous State debts; corporation debts, indi-
vidual debts, and over importations; the mad spirit
of speculation which pervaded the whole country,—
were the natural and inevitable consequences of a
defective system of banking, ''regulated" by the
United States Bank. Those gentlemen are the ad-
vocates and supporters of another United States
Bank. They wish to withdraw the attention of the
people from the evil it has inflicted upon the coun-
try, until they shall again be bound in the chains of
"a bank."
But, sir, is it true that the importations fell off m
1840 and 1841 in consequence of the low duties, u.s
is allegecp Gentlemen on the other side an-
swer this absurdity themselves, although they
seem not to be aware of it. They tell us
that "high protective or prohibitory duties are
necessary to prevent excessive importations"—to
prevent the people from buying too much from for-
eigners. If 20 per cent, duties reduced importa-
tions in 1841, whv will it not have the same effect
in 1844' But if they should deal fairly and frankly
with the people, they would lose the benefit of an
argument calculated to mislead them. Sir, this
device is too gross to deceive anybody. I will tell
gentlemen why it was that importations fell off in
1840 and 1841, in my opinion. It was caused by
the explosion of that bubble created by banks,
called the credit system; it was the bursting of that
storm which had been gathering from the panic
session of Congress in 1834; commencing with the
desperate efforts of the United States bank for the
renewal of its charter; in the end pervading all sec-
tions and classes—rolling up cloud upon cloud,
credit upon credit—increasing in thickness and dark-
