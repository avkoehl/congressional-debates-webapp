The Tariff—Mr. Marshall.
Ho. op Reps.
erished and unfortunate, England never can
under any system of laws, be made the inviting
home to the poor man that our own dear coun-
try is. But free trade is responsible for none
of these evils; and the true test is to compare
the free-trade England of to-day with the high
tariff England of 1842, and in doing so you will
find national and comparative individual pros-
perity on the one hand, and great national dis-
tress and individual embarrassment, privation,
want, and actual starvation on the other.
A REDUCTION OF DUTIES NO CAUSE OF ALARM TO THE
PROTECTED SECTIONS.
Our Pennsylvania friends are wonderfully
exercised at the proposed reduction of the
tariff, and the old cry of 1846 is raised again
that the factories will be closed, the fires of the
furnaces will die out, coal no more be raised
from the bowels of the earth, labor lose its
employment, and distress, weeping, and wail-
ing overwhelm our now prosperous land. I
wish to console our friends with a few facts
that ought to be known to every one, but which
they seem to have forgotten. The consump-
tion of and demand for both coal and iron are
rapidly increasing, notonly in our own country,
but throughout the world, and increased pro-
duction and consumption will continue even
though tariffs should from to-day be blotted
from the memory of man, and production
would continue in a greater ratio because of
the abolition of this miserable system of ob-
struction.
Look at the following facts in regard to pro-
duction and the march of national progress,
furnished by Commissioner Wells from reliable
sources in his report for 18G8. And in consid-
ering this it will bo well to remember that from
1883 to 1842 we were living under the low
graduated compromise tariff; that from 1812
to 1846 we were living under the high protect-
ive tariff of abominations passed in 1842; and
that from 184G to 1801 we were living under
the low revenue tariffs of that period. Keep-
ing these facts and dates in mind, I ask for the
attention of our alarmed friends to the figures
that follow:
"Production of pig iron in 1830, 105.030 tons; in
1810, 317,000 tons, increase in 10 yours, 110 per cent.
"Production in 1815,486,000 tons ; increase m 5 years
■10 per cent.
"Production in 1850,561,000 tons; increase in lOyears,
02 per cent._
"Production in 1835,754,000 tons; increase in5 years,
33 per cent.
"Production in 1S60,913,000 tons; increase in 10 years,
G1 percent.
" It thus appears that the great annual increase in
tho production of pis,' iron took placo prior to the
year 1810, and for 30 years was lenmrkably uniform
at tho rate of 10 to 11 percent, per annum ; and that
since then, no matter what has been tho character of
the legislation, whether the tariff was low or high,
whether the condition of thecountry was ono of war
or peace, the increase of the production has been at
the average of about 8 per cent, per annum, or more
than double the ratio of the increase ot population.
"Again, as another curious illustration of an ap-
parent misconccptionof tho effects of past legislation
upon the development of tho country, take the lol-
lowing paragraph from the rccent report of a con-
gressional committee:
" 'No business men of matureageneedbe reminded
of tlie revulsion which followed in consequence of
tho free-trade system of 1810—the decline of produc-
tion, of immigration, of wages, of public or private
revenue, until the culmination of tho system in the
tariff of 1857, with the memorable crises of that
period; the general ruin of manufacturers and mer-
chants; the suspended payments of the banks; the
reduction of the Treasury to the verged bankruptcy,
and the unparalleled distress among tile unemployed
poor.'
" Now, with all due deference to the committee, the
Commissioner would ask attention to the followi-ng
statistics bearing on the question under considera-
tion :
" Increase in the production of pig iron : in 1810,
317,0:10 tons; in 1815, 186,000; in 1850, 56-1,755; 1855,
751,178; I860, 913,770.
"Increase in the production of Pennsylvania an-
thracite coal: 1812.1.108,418 tons; 1846,2,31-4,005; 1847,
2,882.309; 1849,3,217,641; 1855, 6,486,097; 1S60,8,143,938.
"Increase in the domestic consumption of cotton
north of tho Potomac: 1840,297,000 bales; 1845,422,000;
1819-50,476,000; J 851-52, 588,000 ; 1855, 633,009 ; 1S58-59,
760,000; 1859-00,792,000.
"Inereasein immigration: 1810,84,000; 1815,174,000;
1850, 310,000; 1854,427,000.
"Increase in public revenue: 1810, $19,000,000:
1845, $29,000,000; 1850, $52,000,000; 1855, $74,000,000.
"Increase of national wealth: from 1810 to 1850,
80 per cent.; from 1850 to 1860.126 per cont. In 1854
the 6 per cent, bonds of the United States, issued in
1848, commanded a premium of 21 per cent.
"Commercial tonnage of the United States: 1840,
2,180,000; 1850,3,535,000: 1860,5,353,000.
"Exports and imports: In 1840, $239,000,000; 1845,
$231,000,000; 1850, $330,000,000; 1855, $536,000,000: 1860,
$762,000,000.
"Increase in ship-building: 1842,129,084 tons; 1845,
146,018; 1850,272,219; 1855,583,450.
"Annual increase of railroad construction: 1842,
491 miles; 1845,256; 1847, 669; 1S49,1,369; 1853, 2,452;
1856, 3,643 miles."
From this it appears beyond all question
that the high rate of duties retarded, while
the reduction thereof accelerated production,
progress, and prosperity. And I assure my
distinguished friend from Pennsylvania, [Mr.
Woodward,] whom we all so much admire for
his talents, his attainments, and his virtues,
that he need have no fears that even under
absolute free trade his constituents would not
find abundant and even increased employment.
It would doubtless reduce some what the enorm-
ous profits of capital; but labor in the mines, as
elsewhere, would be greatly benefited thereby.
CONSTITUTIONAL OBJECTIONS TO TIIE PROTECTIVE
SYSTEM.
I shall not to-day discuss at much length
the constitutional objections to the protective
policy of tariff legislation. I have heretofore
indicated my opinion on this question; and,
indeed, I cannot conceive how it can be consid-
ered doubtful, unless we are prepared to disre-
gard all the well-established principles of legal
and constitutional construction. The power of
taxation is one of the most important conferred
on the Government, and its extent and limita-
tions are clcarly defined and prescribed by the
Constitution:
"The Congress shall have power to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts
and provide for tho common defense and general
welfare of the United States."
Here, and here alone, is to bo found the
power of taxation, and this is solely and ex-
clusively to raise revenue for the Government.
The tax is to be collected; collected by the Gov-
crnment to raise money for the Government,
and not for any other purpose. Where m this
clause is power derived to lay a tax, not for
revenue, but to enable Jones or Smith or
Thompson to reap larger rewards on their busi-
ness by this tax; not collected by the Govern-
ment, but by these specially favored gentlemen
from all the consumers of their productions ?
It will hardly be contended that a direct tax
or excise levied on Wilson for the benefit of
Jones would be within the legitimate object of
taxation, and yet it would be as much so as a
duty imposed for that purpose. The argument
on this point was forcibly presented by Robert
J. Walker twenty-five years ago :
"A duty must belaid only that it may bo collected ;
and if it is so imposed that it cannot be collectcd in
whole or in part, it violates tho declared object of
the graitcd power. To lay all duties so high that
none of them could bo collected would be a prohib-
itory tariff. To lay a duty on any one article so high
that it could not be collected would be a prohibitory
tariff upon that article. If a duty of 100 per cent,
wore imposed upon all or upon a number of articles
so as to diminish the revenue upon all or any ol
them, it would operate as a partial prohibition. _ A
partial and a total prohibition are alike in violation
of the true objects of the taxing power. They only
differ in degree, and not in principle. If the revenue
limit may be exceeded 1 per cent, it may bo exceeded
100. If it may be exceeded upon any one article it
may be exceeded on all; and there is no escapetrom
this conclusion but in contending that Congress luay
lay duties on all articles so high asto collect no rev-
enue and operate as a total prohibition." *
"If the tax-gatherers were sent by the Federal
Government to collect a direct tax from tho whole
people, to be paid over to manufacturing capitalists
to enable them to sustain their business or realize
a larger profit, it would be the same in effect as the
protective duty, which, when analyzed in its sim-
plest elements and reduced to actual results, is a
mere subtraction of so much money from the people
to increase the resources of the protected classes."
By what right, constitutional or otherwise,
can this bo done? Is it not, in fact, an atro-
cious abuse of the powers given into the hands
of the Government for the protection of the
rights of the people? Is it not a violation of
the legitimate ends and purposes of Govern-
ment ? For what purpose is this great power
of taxation granted? Manifestly for the sup-
port of Government, to raise revenue to main-
tain its existence and discharge its proper
functions. What right, then, have we under
this grant to levy taxes for the support of the
owner of a coalmine in Maryland, an iron-
foundery in Pennsylvania, a cotton or woolen
manufactory in Massachusetts, or a marble or
slate quarry in Vermont? We levy and col-
lect, in the form of imposts, $170,000,000
annunually for the uses of the Government.
But when we levy this $176,000,000 for the
Government, by what right, I repeat, do you
levy and collect §500,000,000 in addition from
the tax-ridden people, not for the Government,
but for a specially favored class? Independent
of all constitutional questions, what right has
any Government, but more especially a re-
publican Government, to take certain classes
under its protecting carc, make special favor-
ites of them, and compel all other citizens to
pay tribute for their enrichment and aggrand-
izement ? Wkatright has it to force the west-
ern farmer every time he buys a plow, hoe, ax,
wagon, harrow, log-chain, or trace-cliam to
pay 40 per cent, thereon to tho iron lord of
Pennsylvania? Or every time he buys a hat,
coat, or shirt, to pay 50 or 100 per cent, to
the manufacturer of Massachusetts or llhode
Island ? What right has it to tell my constit-
uents and the people of my State that they shall
not build a railroad to carry their produce to
market unless they will pay a tax of from
$2,000 to $5,000 per mile to the iron-makers
of Pennsylvania?
Mr. Chairman, I become impatient and in-
dignant when 1 speak or think of this most
bald and preposterous assumption of right
and power. It is nowhere to be found in tho
Constitution. It exists in no true or just
theory of government. It is a bold and un-
blushing scheme of plunder and robbery. It
is tho most specious and dangerous device by
which the cunnhig lew enrich themselves at,
the expense of (lie toiling millions, by which
capital preys upon labor and cunning absorbs
the earnings of the credulous. I denounce the
whole system as one of cruel, heartless plun-
der, and inexcusable, unauthorized robbery,
in violation not only of tho Constitution but
of all just principles of Government and of
the benign teachings of a Christian philan-
thropy.
WILL WE DF.STKOY HIE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRIES?
But it may be ashed, " Will you break down
the manufacturing industries of the country;
will you destroy the millions of capital now
embarked in these enterprises by a repeal of
existinglegislation ?" My answer is that wrong
and robbery acquire no prescriptive right to
perpetuity. If it be true that this legislation
is a lawless invasion of the rights of otheis; if
its effect has been to embarrass trade, cripple
commerce, prey upon agriculture, destro}' many
important industries, and interfere unwarrant-
ably with the free and natural movements of
enterprise and capital, the fact that you have
for years rioted upon the fruits of labors not
your own, and by this legislative jugglery drawn
to yourselves millions made by the toil of other
hands, gives you no right to stand up in these
Iialls and demand a continuation of such
wrongs.
But I deny thata repeal of these unjust laws
and a return to a constitutional system of tax-
ation purely for purposes of revenue will de-
stroy the manufactures of the country. All
that have a right to live, that are not mere
pensioners upon the public bounty, exotics
that have no proper place in our climate or
upon our soil, will continue to prosper, and
