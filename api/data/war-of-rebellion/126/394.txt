Numbers 90. HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Morehead City, N. C., March 16, 1865.

Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: In obedience to instructions contained in your letter of the 26th of December, 1864, I have the honor to make the following report:

From the 14th to the 25th of October last found me at Chattanooga, Tenn., hurrying and giving all the assistance in my power to the repair of the road from Chattanooga to Atlanta, which had been destroyed by General Hood's army. On the 26th I joined General Sherman at Gaylesville, a small town about thirty miles west of Rome, Ga., where I received his orders, and proceeded the next day to Atlanta, Ga., by his direction, to superintend the removal of all stores, citizens, sick, &amp;c., from that place to Chattanooga. On entering upon this duty I found the accumulation of supplies and the number of sick, wounded, and negroes surprisingly large for the short time we had occupied the place. The removal of the whole, except some property not worth transportation, was accomplished by the 12th of November, 1864, and the army of General Sherman commenced its march from Atlanta to Savannah, Ga., on the 15th of November, 1864.

The army consisted of four corps of infantry and one cavalry division, as follows, viz:

 Men.	 Horses.	 Mules.	 Wagons.	 Ambulan

 	 	 	 	 ces.

Fourteenth 	 15,680	 1,408	 4,436	 571	 112

Corps.

Fifteenth	 18,000	 2,164	 5,726	 666	 146

Corps.

Seventeenth	 11,000	 2,156	 3,107	 385	 77

Corps.

Twentieth	 14,000	 1,740	 4,341	 598	 105

Corps.

Cavalry corps.	 5,000	 7,000	 1,800	 300	 ...

Total.	 63,680	 14,468	 19,410	 2,520	 440

The following was ordered as the allowance of transportation for baggage, &c., on the march.

One wagon to each regiment; two wagons to each brigade headquarters; three wagons to each division headquarters; five wagons to each corps headquarters; one wagon to each battery (there was one battery to each division).

The balance of the transportation was directed to be distributed as follows, viz:

Three wagons to each division for hospital purposes; one wagon to every 100 men, including artillery for ammunition, and the remainder, 1,476 wagons, was used in transporting forage and subsistence, &c.

The army started from Atlanta with four days" grain.

The subsistence transported for the whole army was as follows, viz:

Hard-bread, 20 days" rations; salt meat, 5 days" rations; sugar and coffee, 30 days" rations; soap, rice, candles, 5 days" rations; salt, 80 days" rations.

The quantity of salt taken proved unnecessary, as we found it in the great abundance in the country passed through.

The army started from Atlanta with 5,476 head of beef-cattle in addition to the above.
