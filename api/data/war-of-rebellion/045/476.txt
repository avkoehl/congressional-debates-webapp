Brigadier General WILLIAM F. SMITH,Commanding West of the Susquehanna: SIR: Your dispatch of this date has been received, * and also one * from Colonel W. B.

If, upon further representation, they sill refuse to obey your orders, you will order the regiment to report to Major-General Wool, in New York City. The commanding general desires no such troops in his department, and will not for a moment receive a dictation of service from any officers or men in his command. By command of Major-General Couch:

Major, and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HARRISBURG, July 1, 1863-6 a. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in- Chief, U. S. Army:

GENERAL: I sent you two telegrams last night, and sent the same to General Schenck. Finding the communications cut with Meade's army, I concluded to run to Harrisburg, ascertain the position of affairs, then return to Baltimore, and try to work my way through to Frederick. I found that there had been some skirmishing near Harrisburg yesterday; that the forces gathered for the protection of the place amounted to 16, 000 men, and that information in regard to the movements, position, and numbers of the enemy, and arrangements for keeping advised of the same, were apparently reliable. It appears to have been the intention of the enemy to attack Harrisburg yesterday. Our forces, supposed to be Pleasonton's, were resisting their movements, and, T. A. Scott said, had actually succeeded in retarding the advance on Harrisburg, and compelled a retreat. In thought I saw a much more decisive and important move on the tapis. Lee had received information of the removal of Hooker, and the substitution of Meade. He knew also that Meade's communications were cut by Stuart; that some confusion must exist from the change of commanders; that Meade could not at once ge his forces in hand, and that, by suddenly concentrating and falling upon Meade, he could be crushed, when Washington, Baltimore, and Philadelphia would all be at the mercy of the enemy. I mentioned to Scott my opinion, in which he at the mercy of the enemy. I mentioned to sent the telegrams to you and General Schenck last night. The most reliable information as to the numbers of the enemy, as given by Scott, is as follows: Ewell, 23, 000 men, 48 pieces; Longstreet, 30, 000 men, 122 pieces; Hill, 24, 000 men, pieces not known; Early, 15, 000 men, 26 pieces: total, 92, 000 men and 236 pieces, exclusive of Hill's. Forces of Ewell were counted in Carlisle, Friday p. m. [June 26], as they passed. They left Carlisle by the Baltimore pike, Tuesday [June 30], 5 a. m.
