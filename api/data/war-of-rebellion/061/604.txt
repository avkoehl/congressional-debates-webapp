Numbers 98. Report of Brigadier General James C. Tappan, C. S. Army, commanding Churchill's division, of engagement at Pleasant Hill.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, ARKANSAS TROOPS, (KNOWN AS CHURCHILL'S DIVISION),April 12, 1864.

LIEUTENANT: Being in command of the above-named division in the battle which occurred at Pleasant Hill, La., on April 9, it becomes my duty to report the action of said division in that affair, which will be ever memorable on account of its influence upon the destinies of the Trans-Mississippi Department of the Confederacy. Said division was composed of two brigades, one (Tappan's brigade) commanded in said action by Colonel H. L. Grinsted, and the other (Churchill's brigade) commanded by Colonel L. C. Gause. Brigadier-General Churchill, having been put in command of Parsons' Missouri division and the above-mentioned Arkansas division, put me in command of said division.

On Thursday night, April 7, about 11 o'clock, I received orders from Brigadier-General Churchill to hold the division in readiness to move the next morning for Mansfield at daylight. I gave the necessary orders, and the next morning I moved promptly at the hour directed. We reached Mansfield that evening exactly at 3.30 p. m. The battle of Mansfield was then progressing, but Major-General Taylor not deeming it necessary to order us into the fight, we were directed to take position on what is known as the Gravelly Point road, to prevent a flank movement of the enemy which was anticipated in that direction. That night the division prepared two days' rations
