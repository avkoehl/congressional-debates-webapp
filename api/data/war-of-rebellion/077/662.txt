Numbers 33. Report of Lieutenant Colonel David Thomson, Eighty- second Ohio Infantry.
HDQRS. EIGHTY-SECOND Regiment Ohio VET. VOL. INFTY.,Near Savannah, Ga., December 27, 1864.

CAPTAIN: In compliance with circular from headquarters First DIVISION, Twentieth Corps, I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by my command in the various foraging expeditions sent out from Atlanta, and also in the recent campaign:

The Eighty-second Regiment formed a part of the advance force which occupied Atlanta on the 2nd day of September, and that time was temporarily attached to the command of Brigadier-General Knipe. The First DIVISION, of which the Eighty-Second Regiment formed a part, remained encamped in Atlanta from the time of its occupation by our force until the 15th of November. The enemy having interrupted our line of communication with the rear, various foraging expeditions were sent out south of Atlanta for the purpose of procuring forage and provisions. The brigade to which the regiment is attached was sent out on two of these expeditions, the first expedition under command of Colonel Robinson, commanding THIRD Brigade, First DIVISION, and the second under command of Brigadier-General Geary. On these expeditions the regiment loaded 540 wagons of corn and provender; in addition the following supplies: 50 bushels potatoes, 25 head of hogs, 15 head of sheep, 6 head of cattle, and 20 gallons of molasses.

Early on the morning of the 9th of November the enemy, in small force, made an attack on our picket-line south of Atlanta. The THIRD Brigade was sent to the attacked point, but before getting into position the enemy were repulsed, and the brigade returned to its encampment. *

I am, captain, very respectfully,

D. THOMPSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Regiment.

Captain A. E. LEE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
