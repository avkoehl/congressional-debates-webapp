GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, Numbers 9. March 25, 1864.

Upon relinquishing command I take occasion to express the pride and pleasure I have experienced in my connection with you and my profound regret at our separation. Identified by its services with the history of the war the First Corps gave at Gettysburg a crowning proof of valor and endurance, in saving from the grasp of the enemy the strong position upon which the battle was fought. The terrible losses suffered by the corps in that conflict attest its supreme devotion to the country. Though the corps has lost its distinctive name by the present changes, history will not silent upon the magnitude of its services.

JOHN NEWTON,

Major-General of Volunteers.
