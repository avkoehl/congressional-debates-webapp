HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,In the Field, La Fayette, Ga., September 14, 1863.

Major General T. C. HINDMAN,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: The general commanding desires as early as practicable a written report of the operations of the forces under your command on the 10th and 11th instant, and causes of your delay in an attack on the enemy on the morning of the 11th.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS BUCKNER'S CORPS,La Fayette, September 10 [20], 1863.

Major General T. C. HINDMAN,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: I received orders from you about 6.30 a.m. on the 11th instant to move forward from Morgan's house, on McLemore's Cove, in the direction of Davis' Cross-Roads, distant, I believe, about 5 miles. I started the column a few minutes after 7 a.m. My instructions were, in the absence of any accurate information of the force of the enemy in front and on my right flank, to move with caution and not to hazard an engagement until some reliable information was obtained of the strength and position of the force to be encountered.
