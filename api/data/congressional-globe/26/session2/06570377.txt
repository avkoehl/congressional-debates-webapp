Secretary of 'he Treasurj cugh* to h"\ e i ad A, B,

either in this House or out o" it, against any of-

come an object of ethers, without waitirg furher
evidence Yes, sir, I have heard frequen ly, from
the most ignorant declaimers of that psrtv, such de-
clarations made, in endeavrrwg to rou^eard excitp
the peop'e asainst the last and present Democratic
Republ can Administrations of the coun'rj, but ne-
ver did I expect to hear suci fr "i a memoer on
this floor
Have gen'le'ne.n yet to 'ea'n that >r>e rem< vmg
power is alone in tne hands cf the Pr««i1ect, «nd it
your Seere'ary of the Trcjry,or any ctl er Secre-
tary, was to dare to attempt it, as ieqmred by
those who thus denounce thtm, th") would be
guilty of an act of usurpatirr, fte wnich th^y
wou'd deservedly forfen t! ¡n beads, and lender
themselves tnfa'nous in all time to come'* Never,
sir, have I bien nure a~to i shed than to Wr _uch
dec'aiatjons falh g from g°nt emen pri/e > ng to
be men of m eiJigence, and occupying pl?ces that
should be filled by no others What ' n«Secre a-

is simply to ascertain iuefV ', ¡>nd r pi tt'cmio
the President, after affording a fair an 1 ?nimpai
Ual hearing to the accused' fs th's to b° the doc-
trine and pnnc pies to be acted on by the e*i«ui> g
Administration, and by them be carried o „ i Is h
to be tnat xer  runor i«d suspicion, eye lei lj
some hungry offiee seeker for the place of ln= vic-
tim, are to be taken as evidence of gu It, and your
infuriated Secretary is forthwith, and without a
hearing, to usurp the power of r~mov?r¡ And is
this the refcrmthatyou n?fesibountifully promised
the people o this eoantry, and one of the principle 
that the people decided on, in the ia=t Pres demial
election' If it has been, then i' must come with a
vengeance That there has b en in th s Govern-
ment defaulter , and ever will be, under any future
one, without regatd to the party, ¡n power, all ho-
nest and rational men will readily confess, but to
long as a party, or the heads of ihe party do what
is tn the r power to prevent defalcations, and ex-
pose then, as soon as sahsfact->ry evidence is
procured of the same, no honest or intelligent men
in any community will ever hold them guilty of
soch offences, and at a'l sub] ct them to censure for
their commission
Look, sir, at every instance wheie an m\e tiga-
tion has b°en had m relation to the conduct of the
executive officer ; and see, m everv individual ca«e
where corruption has been alleged, t it has no*
redounded to the most perfect acquittal of all par i-
ctpation, or knowledge, or connivance of it, what-
ever, bf those much abused and persecute i distin-
guished individuals Sir, there is not a paraHel on
record where ther  ha? been so much abuse, and so
many eha-gps made against any me i, or se <f
men, with so little truth to sustain them So little
uto. I say? To this day, 'here has not been out
particle of evidence produced aaainst a member of
the departments, that could have, in anv court of
justice, subjected to censme the merest felon in the
land My allusion is to the conduct of the mem-
bers who are at the heads of those departments
which have been so wantonly assailed by the allied
H. oí Reps.
p <wer , both ,n and on' c^ th s House S r, I am

Í have hud no f vi rs fu m Uem-not even thoe
to tshi' h I thougot my conn tuents entitled, p r«o
nail/, I h* ve ask*d nothing, and certainly from them
I have little o expect st this time, but, as a Repre
tentative of a portion of the freemen of my coun-
try, when I p ak of them a, officers of this Go-
vernm m, to p<-ak truly neither in exeulpa'ion or
in disparagement, save and except what truth itself
shall demand, is a duty which I owe to justice, to
myself, <>nd to the country
Mr Cnairrran, frequent a'lusion  have been
made, h te viá e se h-re, to the conduct and cha
r->cter of one of the officers of the branch mint at
Chailr t , mS rth Carol na, Colonel John Wheel
er He, oo,h^s d en aria gned for extras agance,
prodigality, and conup ion P rrrnt me to =?y, sir,
with tnat gentleman I have long had tie honor of
an intimate acqaairtance I know him we'l, and
his family before him, and I know him to be i gen-
t'eui n of talent-, of the highest honor and integrity,
aga nst «horn the voice of scand?! was never heard
to U-p, until he had taken offic  under this Admt-
n strati n, a gentleman, sir, whose character would
suffer no disparagement, ífit did not use in the
scale of companion with any of his traducéis up n
mis floor, or out cf Ih s Hous" Bat it is said he
writes newspaper paragraphs Grant it And who
has a te ter right, aa a fieeman o' this Republic?
Hi  con uct has been ?s<=ai!rd, and wantonly as-
taIle'l, And pas u como to tKis, in the new reform,
that one is to be ps  i'ed h re, accused, and con-
derrned, and c^nv eted, and n t to be heard m h «
de'ence' When wete^teh dectrmes ever hi"trd of
bsf tie, or dreamed < f b i-g a«seitprl m the conste

Now, s r, from the knowledge of the character

jection beiD  taken to that a"Counf, I hazard no-
thing in nun  tnat tie wo ild not for one moment
have lies a ed to h?ve la1 en the money from his
own pocket and paid l'^ihou' a murmur Ye«,
h^ would have scorned to have portnitted his con-
duct to have been aria gned as a public officer,
howevei unjust it migV nav° be n for btm to have
pT d the meney, and subjected himspif to the ma-
levolence and censuie of h's unfeeling and un-
principled ca'ummators, vt>tn it must be recollect-
ed, too, tha no p?rt of th s ptodigious sum was ap-
propriated to his onn use, but vhoil) to the rm-
PiOvement of the ptop^rty of the Government of

charges maú >, and harped "n so much here and at

stration
The chaiae1 of ' ccnuptton, exfavagance and
prodigality," have b«en made and rung udoh e ery
note of th? polit cd g -mu , against the friends cf
this Admim trat cu. ii has beep so often repeated
and te echoed here, th a t our ears na%e b-en exafen-
ed and s unri'd at its rei «ration Pum the oft-
repeated suinds withou  the vmat,®ns, one we 1
rright suppose the wUI ds lithographed and set to note,
from their regular and m notcnous sound on
this floor It is immaterial udo>i wha' subject
you are called on to act, t is awful note n the
first to greet the ea . Sir, it frequently re-
minded me of the cry oí a cer am mischievous
bird, that has been a pest in the fklds of every
farming and planting m?n, from the eaihest days
of agriculture, and which, at the first approach of
theplarJer, cepsusto pull up his gram, flies oil from
his plunder with cry of "caw, caw, caw," and with
equallv as much meaning, and w^h as little vana
tion, as. do the hoiorab e gen'leman, who upon
e*eiy ocasicn are hea d n crj here, "corruption,
c rrupt o>\ corruption " &," Wnere, sir, is the
coriupt on End ex rair"S"nce sP much corrmamed
n>t Who has beet, guilty of 0 We well know
for the four last year , 'he appropriations by 'his
and the other branch of th s House, have gon„
much above the estimates of the Executive De
partments and the recommendations of the Presi-
dent Will it be denied, then, if there has been
corruption ansing out of the extravagance of this
Administration, that this and the other branch of
Congress are equally, if not more responsible for it,
tban the Executive Departments Mark you, sir,
there never has been yet, within my hearing, any
chaige made for the expending, and disbursement
of more money than what has been appropriated
by law, as passed by this House and Ihe other body
of Congress. The charge of spending more than
was appropriated, I say has never been made, and
of course, no appropriations can be made but by
the assent of bolh bodies
Now, sir, during the time of the highest appro-
priations and the greatest extenditures took place,
which was m '33, '4, '5, the Opposition party
themselves held a majority in the other branch of
Congress, and could at any time have rejected such
extravagant appropriation, if they had deemed it
proper i do so, but they did not do it, they saw the
necessity and mdispensability of the expenditures,
and never raided an objection to them *
If there has been extravagance, then, it must
have had its origin in this House, and for it the
members of this body, individually or collective-
ly, are responsible. The leading measures of the
Government that have increased the expendí Hres
to any considerable amount of a permanent cha-
racter, weie the increase of the pay of the navy,
and the increase of your standing army—and who
wee the champions of these measures? An indi-
vidual who stands high in the Whig party, and had
a d rner givtn him in Norfolk for the part he took
m get tng one of those measures 'hrough Congresf-,
snd if you vill look at the vote on the other sub-
jecf, you will find an equal number of the Whig
members cupportmg it, or a number nearly i s great
in propTtion to their whole number in the House
as ih?tof tne Demrcrats Yoa will find, too—and
I say it to their credit—iheir votes or a majority of
them recorded m favor of most, if not all the ap-
propriations to carry on the Florida war These
are mat ers of record, that the journals of the
House will show, by turning o the yeas and nays,
as recorded on the several «ubj cts.
What measure of at extravagant character, or
one that has involved the expenditure of any yery
large amount, exc pt what is embraced m the regu-
lar aoproptiation bills, fh*t has not been brought
ioruard, for the last several years, by a Whig.
I hold now in my hand the voirs of the members
of tl is House at the las' session of Congress, upon
the m a prod gal and extiavagant proposition that
v* as offered in this Htu e during ihe long sitting of
the last secsiont

On the m< tion of Mr "Wwvis, of the 13ih of February, to

cammittee shall be ifopnion that the particular worlr ought
to be entirety d ¡xonl nue-l and m such case if any, the com-
mittee shall submi lo this House the reasons wt ich lead to such
conclusions ^
the inam question was then put on the ami-ufJinent or sub
stituteofMi MARVisforthe amendment of Mr PioWiS, ard
passed n the negative  veas 80 nays 112
Of the 80 in ihe affirmative, there are 53 "Wh g,
to 27 Democrats-
Of the 112 m the negative, there are 33 Whigs to
80 Democrat ,
Leaving a large majority of the whole of the
Whig party votmg in favor of this, the most ex-
travagant proposition that was made during the
last session, and a large majority of the Democats
■voting against it Yet the Democrats are de-
nounced for extiavagance, and the Whigs are
landed as c osefisted economists to the people
But, sir, again, the next most extravagant pro-
position that was made during the last session, m
the Commifee of the Whole, was made by tbe
membí'r from Indian [Mr. Paopfit, a Whig] to ap-
The Opposition and Conservatives had the majority m the
House also in 1838.  3S
