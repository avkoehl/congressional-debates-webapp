agency of banks, which is not provided for m the
Constitution, it is to deprive the system of that
function and power, without which it cannot go on
The principal arguments relied upon to prove that
the banks are safer than public depositories, is,
that you have the additional security of the capital
of the bank. There is Utile force in this, because
the same misconduct in the officers of a bank
might waste your funds, and destroy the ca-
pital of the bank. The failure of banks is, in al-
most every instance, occasioned by the misconduct,
and often the frauds, of a few of the direc-
tors who control them, they withdraw their whole
capital into their private business or speculations,
and if these turn out badly, the bank is i uined This
appears to have been the cise with the banks which
have recently exploded at Boston and elsewhere
Whether you entrust your funds in banks, oi the
hands of your own officers, you must trust to the
honesty and responsibility of those who have the
custody of them. But, in one case you entrust it
to the officers of a corporation, over whom you
have no control, and whom you have authorized
to loan it and use it as a part of their own capital,
m the private business and speculations of indivi-
duals In the other, you confide it to your own
officers, responsible to your own laws, not only
civilly but criminally, and who are prohibited from
using the public funds of which they have the custody
In point of security the advantages appear to be m
favor of the proposed plan, and I will now proceed
to show that experience fully confirms thisopinion,
deduced from the principles of the two systems
By a report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
now on our files, made in pursuance of a lesolu-
tion offered by the Senator from Massachusetts,
and amended on my own motion, the following
facts appear
That the Tieasury has sustained a direct loss
from depositing its revenues in banks, from 1816
to 1836, principal and interest, of - $1,892,642
By the depreciation on bilk,  which
were received and paid out, from
1814 to 1817 inclusive, from five to
six millions of dollars, say             -      6,000,000
By bills of banks that have failed, and
are now onhand   -           -          -         178,470
By  the withholding of dividends by
the late Bank of the United States,
under a pretext of a claim for da-
mages for the protest of a bill on
France, principal and interest       -        233,422
Total              -           -   4,8,301,534
On the fust of May last, just before the bank ex-
plosion, there was in the deposite banks to the cre-
dit of the Treasurer and disbursing officers the sum
of |31,212,058, of which twenty millions of dol-
lars has been paid on the drafts of the Treasurer, and
about one milium and a half of that sum m specie,
leaving eighteen and a half millions, which have
been paid m the depreciated bills or credit of the depo-
site banks The average dissount on these bills can-
not be less than six per cent and is probably more
it has varied at different periods, and m different
places, it was for some time not less than 8 or 10
per cent at New York, and m Tennessee and Mis-
sissippi was from 12 to 15 per cent Six per cent
on |18,500,000 is a loss of $1,110,000 There is
now in the deposite banks nearly $10,000,000 to
the credit of the Treasurer and public officer^, the
average discount on which cannot be less than 4
per cent making $400,000, all of which sums form
an aggregate of $9,814,534 as the loss which has
accrued from the connection of the Treasury with
the banks since 1814 The estimated loss during
the past year has fallen mostly on the creditors of the
United States, and the several States who have re-
ceived the instalments they were entitled to under
the deposite act of 1836, in the depreciated credit of
the deposite banks.
In consequence of the failure of the deposite
banks, almost every class of public creditors, since
that period, have been, from necessity, paid m a
depreciated currency, the soldiers, seamen, labor-
ers on the public works, fishermen, (their bounties
for the exportation of fish,) and the pensioners As
far as could be done, some of these meritorious cre-
ditors have been paid m specie, amounting in all,
including Indian annuities, to between five and six
millions of dollars.
But because the loss the past year has not fallen
directly on the Treasury, but on individuals, it is
not the less a loss to be charged upon the connec-
tion of the Treasury with the banks, it is, indeed,
a loss much more to be deploied than though it had
fallen on the Treasury.
Wo estimate has, or can be made, of the loss to
the public creditors, and individuals having deal-
ings with the Government, during the derangement
of the finances and depreciation of bank papei,
from 1814 to 1817, but, theie can be little doubt
that it exceeded the loss sustained directly by the
Tieasury, which has been estimated at six millions,
and this, added to the formei sums, makes an aggre-
gate of $15,814,534 as the loss íesultmg from the
connection of the Treasury with the banking sys-
tem since 1814
No^, sir, what have we to offset against this
enormous loss1! Why, the Senator from Virginia
takes up the report of the Secretary of the Treasu-
ry containing a list of public defaulters, and says,
with an air of tnumph, that it contains testimony
enough to blow die Independent Treasury scheme
to the winds Well, sir, what is this testimony?
Why, it is a list of officeis whose accounts have
nc t been regularly balanced on the books of the
Treasury from the foundation of the Government,
but is no evidence of what is actually due from
those officeis The report itself contains an expla-
nation of many of the cases of apparent default.
In a laige portion of the cases there is nothing due
the Treasury 1 he first President Adams still ap-
pears as a defaulter on the books of the Treasury
for an amount exceeding twelve thousand dollars
TheSenatoi says Ihese defalcations amount to near
three millions of dollars, but, from the best infor-
mation I can obtain from the Treasury Depart-
ment, it does not much exceed one million How
stands the account, then' One million lost by re
ceivmg officers, and more than filteen millions by
the bank1-1
Mr President, having attempted to show the
practicability of the Independent Treasury system,
and to demonstrate its greater safety and security
to the publi revenues, 1 will notice, briefly, some
of the objections which are urged against it.
We are told that it will be very expensive. The
Senator from Vngima i ays that he is informed by
a very intelligent gentleman, who is a friend of
the measure, that it will cost six hundred thousand
a ycai, and the Senator from Indiana (Mr Smith)
says it will cost two millions the first year, and a
half a million afterwards. The expense of putting
the establishment in operation, cannot be estimat-
ed with much accuracy, but the expense after-
wards of conducting the finances, every one can
see, will be but a small sum We are not in the
dark on the subject, it consists ot paying the
salanes of four Receiver^ General, and a few
clerks It is a small affair, and not worth serious
consideration But cannot the Government afford
the cxpen e of taking care of its own funds, and
lo avoid t> e expense, must it loan them to the
banks to take care of them for the Government'
This would be an excellent doctrine for the
banks, who claim the monopoly of keeping the pub-
lic money
The prmciole n this bill which requires that ulti-
mately the public dues should be paid in specie,
is perhaps with some, the most objectionable part
of the measure Mr Dallas, when Secretary of
the Treasury, m the very report to which the late
Bank of the United States owed its origin, sajs the
Government had received bank notes from neces-
sity only, and ihat time would soon come when we
ought to receive for the public dues nothing but
specie or Treasury notes He says "the Treasury
yielding from necessity to the general impulse, has
hitherto concerned to receive bank paper m pay-
ment of duties and taxes, but the period approaches
when it will probably become a duty to exact the
piyment, either m Treasury note', or in gold and
silver com. the lawful money of the United States "
At that period there wab not fifteen millions of
specie in the United States, and now there is over
eighty millions It would, seem therefore, that
the time has arrived, if it is ever to come, when
the public dues should be collected in com The
operation of this principle seems to be misappre-
hended. It is said that it will drain the specie from,
the banks, and greatly diminish their capacity for
supporting their issues. This is a mistake. It will
not drain specie from the banks, or if it does, its
place will be immediately supplied; it will create a
new demand tn the country for specie, equal to the
usual balance m the Treasury, and what js in use in
the fiscal transactions of the Government, amount,
ing to from five to seven millions of dollars, and
this additional demand for specie will draw and
retain so much more of the precious metíais into
the country. If, at first, this demand is supplied in
part from the banks, it must finally come from
abroad. When the Bank of England resumed
the payment of specie, in 1822, such was the de-
mand lor com that no less than twenty-four
millions of dollars annually was imported foi
four years to fill up the vacuum, which the
long use of paper had occasioned. The additional
demand of from five to seven millions in the
United States, would te supplied from abroad in one
year, and without being felt. The requirement
of specie for the public dues, would reduce the cir-
culation of the banks to the amount of the sum or-
dinarily in the Treasury, and in use in the transac-
tions of the United States; about the amount Í have
named, and so far would dimmish the profits of the
banks, but would, in no degree, impaii their capa-
city to make discounts to individuals, but would
rather increase it, as the five or seven millions of
their currency, which had been absorbed in the
transactions of the Treasury, being replaced by
coin, there would be, to that extent, an increased
ability, on the part of the banks, to supply the de-
mands of the community. This principle would
not only draw an additional sum of specie into the
country, but would keep it in active circulation',
and what is taken from the banks will be returned
to them again This demand for specie and circu-
lation of it to the extent of the fiscal transactions of
the United States, will keep up a demand on the
banks for specie that will rendei it necessary for
them to keep a greater supply in their vaults, which
will tend, in some degree, to check their excessive
issues, and to dimmish their proáts arising from
such excessive issues of their notes. But there is
little reason to believe that this restraining princi-
ple could operate with sufficient force to keep down
the bank issues to their proper level, or to give that
degree of stability and soundness to the currency
which is so desnable Instead of its crippling the
banks, it will not be a sufficient check upon them.
But it is said that this principle will tend to cre-
ate an internal dram of specie, at the very time that
there is an exteinal dram from abroad, occasioned
by the excess of importations This may be the
case to a certain extent, and its effect will be highly
salutary, as it will tend promptly to check importa-
tions, and adjust the balance of trade before it goes
on to an extent to become dangerous The excess
of importations commenced in 1831, and, being sus-
tained by the use of the credit of the Bank ot the
United States and foreign credit, >t was not checked
as it ought to have been, but continued until 1837,
which has involved the country m its present diffi-
culties
It is uged that demanding specie for public dues,
will tend to hoard the money of the country In-
stead of this, it will, as I have already said, draw
into the country an additional amount of specie,
and keep it m active circulation
Mr President, ■« e have had a new version of the
old objection, that this bill will create two curren-
cies, one for the Government and one for tr e peo-
ple The Senator from Virginia says this is not an
ad captandxitn argument It is an ad caplandum
argument, as applied to this bill, because it intro-
duces no new principle in this respect. Is it meant
that, under this bill, we should have two currencies
in law, or two in fact' The former cannot be con-
tended, because the bill does not legalize any paper
currency, either for the Government or the people.
The objection then i  nothing more than this that,
under this bill, there will be two currencies, one
receivable for the public dues, and another not re-
ceivable, but which may circulate among the peo-
ple, if they see fit to take it and pay it out, but
