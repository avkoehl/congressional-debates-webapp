[Major General D. H. HILL:]

GENERAL: I have sent the battery which came with Colonel Martin's regiment (it arrived this morning) back to its station. I have more light artillery than I can use. Forage is getting very scare, and Colonel M. says it is needed in the defense of Rainbow Banks. I would also suggest in this connection that Captain Starr's battery be also ordered to Greenville, or any other point you may deem best. The batteries of Captains Reilly and Bunting are sufficient, I should think, for the command. The enemy strengthen their works every night. Their line of intrenchments is now as strong as it can well be made, as far as I can judge with my glass. My wagon train started down to Pungo yesterday morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. B. GARNETT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Petersburg, Va., April 9, 1863-9 a. m.

Major General D. H. HILL,

Commanding Department of North Carolina:

GENERAL: If you can operate without the aid of Evans' brigade the commanding general desires you to order it to be in readiness to move to Charleston at a moment's notice. If you need it and cannot get along without it he desires you to retain it. General Longstreet left last night for Franklin. Your communication by courier of the 7th instant is received. It will be forwarded at once to the general.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. MOXLEY SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
