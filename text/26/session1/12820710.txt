F'eedom of Elec'ions—Mr. Gentry.
H. of Heps.
opinio  that it was 'highly culpable in Federal officers to inter
fere in the business of electioneering '    When writing upon this
subjecthesays  'Freedom of election being essential to the niu
tual independence  of Government,  and   with  the different
branches of the samo Government so vitally cherished by most
of our Constitutions, it is deemed improper for officers, depending
on the Executive of the Union, to attempt to control or influ
ence the free exercise of the elective right'   He further says to
tha officers under him that 'he expects they will not attempt to
influence the votes of others, nor take any part in the business
of electioneering, that being deemed inconsistent with the Con
s itution, and their duties to it'"
'In support of the opinion I entertain, I refer you to another
high authority The present Chief Magistrate (Gen* ral Jack
son,) in his Inaugural Address, when speaking of Executive d u-
ties which demanded particular attention, refers directly to the
'correction of those abuses that have brought the patronage of
the Federal Government into conflict with the freedom of elec-
tions.' Strengthened, as I am, by these expressions of opinion,
I feel the less hesitation in saying that every officer of the Fede
ral Government is entitled to a free and uninterrupted right of
suffrage, and should not be disturbed in the exercise of it, but
when they become partisans in elections, and attempt to con
trol the elective lranchise in others, t hey should be dismissed
from public employment and 1 should be gratified to see this
principle acted out to its fullest extent, whether the officer thus
encaged act with or against the party to which I belong
When I see an office-holder interfering in elections, the first
i 'ea that strikes rre is, that he l  thinking of his ofhee and his
bread, and, therefore, an unfit adviser of those whose only ob-
ject is the public good "
Mr Speaker, these are principles which have ever been held
by the true Republicans uf our country, and they are precisely
those which are now entertained by the Whig party They are
repudiated by the supporters of the present President, because
they know that he was elevated to the Presidency by the viola
turn of these principles, and that he relies upon the same
"abuses in the administration of Executive patronage," which
elevated him to power, to secure his re-election Hence his
partisans are driven to the necessity of renouncing the princi
pies which they once professed, and of defending and justifying
these corrupting «buses from which they formerly pretended to
apprehend so much danger to the public liberty But, sir, I
have yet in reserve an authority to sustain and justify me in
the position which I tske upon the subject of Executive power
and influence, for which I am confident my colleague feels a
higher and more profound respect than for the distinguished m
dividuals whose opinions I have brought to my aid in this dis-
cussion It is the opinion of one no less distinguished than my
colleague himself I have already informed the House that my
colleague isa new convert to Van Buren Democracy; and, like
most new converts, his present zeal -and devotion is in exact
proportion with his past wickedness and infidelity It will be
remembered that, towards the close of General Jackson's admi
lustration, when the public mind was directed to the choice of
bis successor, the people of Tennessee, believing that they saw
in hie effort to control the selection of his successor a violation
of those principles which had elevated him to power, rose up in
noble resistance against his arrogant attempt to dictate to them,
and nominated a distinguished citizen of their own State (Judge
White) for the Presidency Popular enthusiasm rose high m
his favoi, and, with few exceptions, the people of that State
were united in his support No one was louder in professions
cfadmira'ion for i he character and services of Judge White,
and of devotion to the principles with which he stood identified,
than my colleague, and no one was more bitterly vehement
than he in denouncing and opposing Mr Van Buren. He
threw himself into the current, which was running strong m
favor of Judge While, and was triumphantly borne by itlnto
the Legis'ature of Tennessee I was also a uiembcr-of that Le
gralature, and was an humble co laborer in that good cause bo
zealously espoused and supported by ray colleague.
In obedience to the mandate uf the popular will, that Legis-
lature adopted a preamble ard resolutions formally presenting
Judge White to the people of the United States as a candidate
for the Presidency, in which they enumerated the objects which
thev had in view in seeking to elevate him to that high station,
as follows-
'1  To secure to the people the exercue of the right of suf
frage m the election of the President of the United States, in-
dependent of the influence and dictation of caucus nomina
tloM.
"2. To resist the establishment of the practice of electing the
President according to any plan of regular succession among
the great functionaries of the Government
"3 The limitation and control of Executive patronage with-
in such safe and expedient bounds as to secure the freedom
and punty of the elective franchise against all undue official
influences."
Mr. Speaker, I need sot cay that the bill under consideration
aims at the accomplishment of the object last specified in the
extract which I have just read My colleaeue voted for that
preamble; and so conspicuous had been his xeal on that occa
«ion, that he was selected by th<> presiding officer of the House
of Representatives to be one of a committee which was ap-
peroted to inform Judge White of his nomination by the Legis-
lature as a candidate for the Presidency; and as my colleague
hasthoUght proper to denounce that distinguished individual in
the grossest and most unsparing terms, on more than one occa-
sion during the-present session of Congress, I * ill read the letter
which that committee addressed to him, that the House may see
how great has been the change in the opinion  of my colleague
n relation to men as well as principles
_                         "NASHTIM.B, Oct. 23,1836.
"To the Hon HüoiiL White
"Sir, 1 he undersigned have been appointed a committee of
the General Assembly to inform you that the people of the
State of Tennessee have, by their Representatives, nominated
you to their fellow-citizens of theVnued States forthe office of
Chief Magistrate This duty v,e conceive will be best dis-
charged by communicating to you the preamble and resolutions
adopted by both Housesot the Geneial Assembly. From them
you will learn the principles upon which the nomination was
made. These, as also the attending circumstances, we take
leave to say, appear to us no lees honorable to the people of the
Sute than to youiself. By this act they have shown adiscrimi-
nation and devotion to principle worthy the imitation of pos-
terity.
" We avail ourselves of this occasion to tender to you the as-
surances of our esteem and veneration Tor your character, and
our ardent wishes for your personal happiness "
Then follow the signatures of the •committee, my colleague
[Harvey M Wattlrson] bema one ot the number
¡such, sir, was the po' tical poution ol my colleague m 1S35,
and such the evidence upon which I rely to sustain the position
whlchl assumed in íeleren e to him at the outset of my re
marks What new lights have beamed upon his vision to
work such a marvellous change in his principles, and in Ins
opinions of men, 1 will not conjecture, but, when I shall have
finished his political history, 1 think it probable thatevery gen-
tleman on this floor will be able o judge of that question in a
manner quite satisfactory to himself The great political bat
tie was fought, and victory perched upon the standaid of Mr
Van Buren Ilia prede< essor, at the hea 1 ol his trained band—
his corps of a hundred thousand office holders, whom Mr Bu-
chanan (a leader of the Van Buren party) once styled 'the
hired soldiers of the President," proved to be an overmatch for
those who struggled against a combination so powerlul But
the political banner which Tennessee had unfuiled was nobly
upborn  by her sons, and though struck down elsewhere, it
waved in proud and elonous triumph within her own borders.
In the summer of 1837, another election was held in that State
for members of Congress and the Legislature The same ques
tions entered into that election which had control led the preced-
ing one Those who had opposed the election of Mr Van Bu
rcn, with few exceptions, stood forth in opposition to his Ad-
ministration, declaring that the wai against him should never
end until the principles of Republicanism, which had been vio
lated in his election, should be vindicated and re established,
and the injuries inflicted upon the spirit of the Constitution re-
pressed and repaired The people rallied to thesupportof their
principles, and returned to the Legislature a large majority of
members opposed to the Administration of Mi Van Buren
My colleague was not a candidate for reelection, but, very
soon after the result of the contest was known, he forwarded to
me his congratulations upon the success of the Opposition,
with an announcement that he would be a candidate for clerk
of the Legislature, of which I had been elected a member The
Legislature convened, a large majority, as I before remarked,
being opposed to the Administration of Mr Van Buren. My
colleague, in accordance with the previsus intimation which 1
had received from him, became a candidate fora clerkship, and
was elected I will Hot say, nor do I believe, that his oppo*i
tion to Mr Van Buren was the only merit which gave him a
claim to that station, but, certain I am that he could not have
procured it if he had occupied even a doubtful position on that
question Meanwhile, the supporters of Mr Van Buren, though
repeatedly defeated, had never despaired of ultimately effecting
a political revolution m Tennessee The patronage of the Fe-
deral Government was steadily and effectively employed for
the consummation of that object
By artfully addressing himself to the cupidity of the avari-
cious, and to the ambition of the aspiring spirits of that State,
the President succeeded in enlisting to his support some of the
most talented and influential men in Tennessee, who, with zeal,
sharpened and stimulated by the hope of reward or promotion
effectively exerted themselves to induce the people to believe
that it was their interest and their duty to ground the arms of
opposition to Mr Van Buren, and give him their support By
such means as these, a considerable diversity of political opi
nion was created in the public mind, and, in some parts of the
State, very great changes in favor of Mr Van Buren had been
effected In the Congressional districts which was then repre-
sented by Mr Polk but which is now repr sented by my col-
league, [Mr Watterson ] a complete revolution in public sen
timent had been effected In the autumn of 1838, James K
Polk, then Speaker of this House, announced himself as a can-
didate for the office of Governor of Tennessee, for the well un
derstond purpose of revolutionizing that State in reference to
nationa1 polines, with a view to the accomplishment of ulterior
obiects connected with his own political aggrandizement. His
character asa popular orator, and the extraneous aid which it
was known would be brought to his support, In pired the Van
Buren party with lively hopes of success, and stimulated them
to another desperate strugglp Throughout the length and
breadth ofTennessee, "the bu«j note of preparation" sounded,
and the champions on either side were girdmcthmselves for the
conflict It was obvious to all that a struggle for political su-
premacy between the two parties, more fierce and terrible than
any which had preceded it was about being made It was
a time to "iry the souls of men" It was a time when "sum-
mer soldiers and sunshine patriots" would shrink from the se-
vere encounter, and when each "tme man" would nobly and
feailessly stand forth to mainta n and defend, at all hazards, the
cause and the principles which his conscience and his reason
approved
At the moment when the first battle call rose upon the breeze
—when the first war cry of the enemy was heard in the die
tance, and answering shouts of defiance from those whose souls
were determined and unternfied, gave evidence that the battle
was about to begin, and that "danger and death" would be the
order of the day—my colleague skulked away from the standard
which he had followed so long—abandoned the cause and the
principles to which he had professed to be so warmly devoted-
deserted his friends in their hour of utmost need and peril—
totned the enemy—took a commission in his service—turned
his sword against his friends, and became the slanderer and re-
viler of those lor whom he had previously professed the warm
est personal and political friendship' '
Mr Speaker, my colleague took occasion, at an early period
of this session, upon a question about which he and myself dif-
fered m opinion, to express his reerct that we could not "stand
shoulder to shoulder ' upon a subject in relation to which the
interests of our constituents were the same Sir, I do not de-
sire to offend my colleague, but after the experience I have al
ready had of an alliance with him, I cannot resist the impulse
which prompts me to tell him that it can never hereafter be a
cause of regret with me to find him«in opposition to me upon
any subject whatever I deem i' safer to contend with him as
an adversary, than to rely upon him as a friend No man
fears to encounter an enemv who advances boldly and undis-
guisedly to the front, challenging to the conflict but the bravest
may well fear the stiletto thrusts of falsehearted and perfidious
friends. I am contending now for the same princi pies for which
1 contended when my acquaintance with mv colleague com-
menced in the Legislature of Tennessee, in 18T5 Nothing has
transpired since that nme to weaken my convictions of the cor-
rectness of those principles, or create a doubt of the propriety of
the opposition which was then made by the people of Tennessee
to the election of Mr Van Buren I can conceive of no cause
which can justify my colleague in the course which he has
thought proper to pursue; and I tell him again, once for all,
that I cannot and do not appreciate the regret which he
expressed Not content wi h having renounced principle
the maintenance of which ho once declared to be essential to
the preservation of the public libeity, and with having aban-
doned ft lends for whom he professed the highest esteem, he
seeks to commend himself to the favor ol his new political
associates, by violent'y denouncing his former principles,
and villifying the friends to whom he pretended to be so
much devoted When he addressed the House upon the bill
now under consideration, lie alluded to the votes of the two
Senators who recently represented the State of Tennessee in
the other end of this Capitol upon a bill introduced in the
Senate by Mr Crittenden of Kentucky, somewhat similar in
its provisions to the one under consideration He characte
nzed those Senator , and their political friends in Tennessee,
as apostates and Federalists and infirmedthe House that the
votes which they gave in favor of that bill had been fatal
to them—that they were politically dead. If they are indeed
dead, why does my t olleague assault them so furiously? Does
mv colleague [Mr Watterson] possess that unenviable cou
rage which prompted Falstaffto thrust his sword into a dead
hero? Does he delight to mangle dead bodies'! Will he, like
Falstaff claim to be made a Duke, aBa reward for his chivalry?
Or to be appointed Receiver General? Or have his services
requited by any other office within the gift of the Executive'
If those gentlemen are, as my colleague says, politically pros,
trate in the State of Tennessee, why does he travel rut of his
way to denounce them? Is he under the contiol of that princi-
ple of human nature which makes a man, who is conscious of
having injured another, pursue the injured individual with un
relenting and unforgiving hatred? One of the Senators whom
he denounced [ ludge White] was, at that time, cor fined to a
bed of sickness, from which it was not expected he would re
cover Since that time, he had paid the last debt of nature
He has passed the
"Undiscovered bourne, whence no traveller returns."
He has stood before that dread tribunal before which all must
stand He isa tenant of the tomb Will the grave shelter
•him from that malignity which in his lifetime never slept?
May he not find a refuge m death from that storm of slander
and detraction with which his political enemies sought to
overwhelm him, before death had robbed them of their victim?
But sir, I deny that he is politically dead The purity and
severe simplicity of his life—the stern integrity of his charac-
ter—his incorruptible patriotism—his long and illustrious ser.
vices to his country, remain the property of hie countrymen,
in whose gratitude and affection he will live forever, and fa-
thers and mothers will point their children to his histoiy, as
furnishing an example for them to imitate, when the names
and memories of those who reviled him while living, and who
will slander him when dead, shall be buried in the grave of
eternal oblivion The other distinguished individual to whom
my colleague alluded as being politically dead, [Mr Foster,]
is not dead, physically or politically True, his political op-
ponents, through a combination of adventitious circumstances,
which will never again exist, obtained a majority in the last
Legislature ofTennessee, and gave instructions to Mr Foster
and his colleague (Judge White) which honor and patriotism
forbade them to obey They resigned their seats, and appeal-
ed from the Legislature to the people—from a packed jury to
an honest one Judge White was not permitted to live until
the veidict of the people was rendered, but Mr roster is be-
fore them, ably and manfully vindicating himself and his de-
ceased colleague The people have awarded to him the privi-
lege of speaking for himself He is speaking to them the words
of truth and soberness," which sink deep into their hearts and
understandings He is scattering the seed of truth upon good
ground, which will bring forth the fruit of political regenera-
tion and redemption, to the mortification of my colleague [Mr.
Wattkrson] at d his political coadjutors in Tennessee.
But, Mr Speaker, I am aware that it is quite unnecessary
for me to defend Judge White or Mr Foster from the denuncia-
tions of my colleague Their fame and characters rest
upon a basis too broad to be shaken by his puny arm I will
therefore proceed to nonce other matters introduced by him
into this debate, many of them of a character so paltry and
contemptible that I feel it to be a humiliating necessity
which imposes upon me the task of discussing them He
undertook to defend the Administration of Mr Van Buren
against the charges which have been made against it in re-
lation to the extraordinary defalcatiens of public officers which
have occurred, and for this purpose he read from an official
communication made by Levi Woodbury, purporting to show
that the losses to Government, on account of the defalcation
of public officers, had been greater under the Administration
of Mr Adams than under that of General Jackson, in propor-
tion to the amounts collected and disbursed Without Baying
any thing in read to the credibility of the evidence which
my col'eague introduces to sustain his position—but, for the
sake of argument, admitting it to be true—does it constitute a
defence of Mr Van Bur en's administration? The same officer
has informed us that the whole amount of losses to the Govern-
ment^ account of defalcations, from its commencement up
to 1S37, the beginning of Mr Van Buren's administration, was
2,038,594 81; and we know that accident has developed to our
knowledge the defalcations of two individuals, who have
plundered from the public Treasury since that time
81,297,829 75' How many millions have been plundered
of which we are uninformed, and will ever remain uninformed,
I will not undertake to conjecture But, sir, let justice be done
Let not the partisans of Mr Van Buren be permitted to throw
around him the character and popularity of General Jackson,
to protect him from the public indignation and disapprobation
The next great question which my colleague introduced to
the consideration of the House was a Whig committee of Cin-
cinnati, which he says have taken General Harrison under their
especial keeping, and will not permit him to write or speak, or
in any manner publish to the world the principles which will
govern his administration, m the event that he is elected Presi-
dent of the United States I reply to that portion of my col-
league's speech by reading a short extract from Gen Harrison's
letter accepting the nomination of the Harnsburg Convention
as a candidate for the Presidency    It is as follows
"It may, perhaps, be expected that I should embrace this oc-
casion to declare the principles upon which the Administration
will be conducted, if the efforts of my friends to place me in the
Presidential chair should prove successful. But having, in a
letter to the honorable Harmar Denny, and in another to the
honorable Sherrod Williams, both of which have been made
public, given my views at some length of the character and tx
