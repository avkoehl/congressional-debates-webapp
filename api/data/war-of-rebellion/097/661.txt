WINCHESTER, VA., April 8, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have for some time desired to send a large force of infantry and cavalry through Loudoun and Fauquier Counties, with the expectation of putting a stop to Mosby's operations, by going through and over the Blue Ridge so effectually with infantry as to capture most of his band and stock. He has about 500 men. This will take several days, and I do not feel at liberty to place so large a part of my troop where they would not be immediately available, if called on. If I can at anytime, hereafter, learn that it will be safe to take the time I will send out the expedition.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 8, 1865-11.30 a. m.

Major-General AUGUR:

Major-General Hancock desires that the two regiments, First Corps, at Camp Stoneman, be sent to this place as soon as they can be properly sent. The Fourth Regiment, Lieutenant-Colonel Dobbs commanding, is probably ready now. The Third Regiment must also be ready in a day or so at farthest.
