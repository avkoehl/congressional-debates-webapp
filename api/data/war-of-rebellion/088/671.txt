HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 2, 1864.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 2, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

The cavalry is very closely massed in the only open space within our line in this vicinity, a space too small camping. If the command is to return to its former camp I would request that I may be permitted to send a portion away before dark, as the road across to the plank road is very difficult to travel in the dark. Parties sent our reconnoitering can discover no movement of the enemy in a southwesterly direction.

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 2, 1864. (Received 9.50 p.m.)

General ORD:

No; nothing new. A column of Gregg's cavalry made a dash close to the Boydton plank road, opposite Warren's headquarters, this morning early, but found the road guarded. The losses on both sides were few. Nothing further during the day.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
