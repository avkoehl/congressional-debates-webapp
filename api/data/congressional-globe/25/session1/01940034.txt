lions were thus ponre 1 into the Treasury beyond
the wants of the Government, which became m
time the source oí the mov extravagant expendi-
tures    This vast increase of receipts and expen-
ditures was followed by a" corresponding expansion
of the business of tlie banks    They had to discount
and issue freely to enable the merchants to pa} their
duty bonds, as well as to meet the vastly inci eased
'expenditures of the Government    Anothei  effect

expansion to trie action of the banks, and which i«
worthy of notice.    It turned the exchange with
England in favor of this countiy    That portion of
the proceeds oí our exports, which  in consequence
of the high duties, could no longer leturn with
profit, in the usual articles which we had been in
the habit of receiving puncipally from that coun-
try in exchange foi oar exports, returned in gold
and silver, in order to purchase similar articles at
the North.   This was the first cause which gave
tn it wester i direction to the piecious metals, the
rev ulaive return oí w men has     ui loilowed by so

of perceiving the true  reason of the expansion of

issues increased almost without limitation    "nd an
immense surplus   if venue  accumulated in the de-
posite banks, which, after the payment of the pub
lie deb', the most extravagant appropriations eou'd
not exhaust, and whic'i acted as additional bank-
ing capita!    The value oi mone} daily depreciat-
ed, prices rose, and then commenced those un-
bounded speculations, paiticularly in publtr lands
■which was transferred, by millions of acres, from
the public to the speculatois for worthies-, bank
no'es, till at length, the swelling flood was checked,
and the revulsive current burst its baiaeis, and
oygrspread and desolated the land
The fust check came from the Bink of England,
which, alarmed at the loss of its precio s metals,
refused to discount American bills, in order to pre
vent a further decrease of its cash means, and cause
a return of those which it had lost Then follow-
ed the exerut'on of the deposite act, which, instead
of a i emedial measu-e, as it might hav e been made
if properly executed, was made the instrument of
weakening the banks at the point of pressuie, espe
cially in the gi eat metropolis of the Union, where
so large a portion of the surplus íetenue was ac-
cumulated And, finally, the Tieasury ordei,
which still iuither weakened fhose banks, by with-
drawing their cash means to be invested in public
lands in the west
It is often easy to prevent what cannot be reme
died, which the present instance strongly illus-
trates If the administration had formed a true
conception of the danger m time, what has since
happened might have then been easily averted
The near appioach of the expiration of the ehartei
of the United States Bank would have afforded am-
ple means of spying the desolation, if it had been
timely and properly used I saw it then, and pur-
posed lo renew the charter, for a hmi'ed period,
with such modifications as would have effectually
resisted the increasing expansion of the currency,
and, at the same time, gradually and finally, wear
out the connexion between the bank and the Gov
emment To use the expiession Ithenu=ed "to
unbank the banks," to let down the svstem easily,
and so to effect the separation between the bank and
(he Government as to avoid the possmihty of that
shock which I Ihen saw was inevitabis without
some such remedy The moment was eminently
piopitious The precious metals weie flowing in
on us ficm evtr> quaitei, and the vigorous mea-
sures I purposed to adopt m the renewal oí the
charter, would have effectually anestedthe increase
of banks and checked the excess of their di'covuts
and issues , so that the accnmu'atmg mass of gold
and silver, m' ad of being coivened m'obaik
camtal and swelling the tide of papci cucnlation,
would have been substituted m the place oí bank
notes, as a peimanent and wholesome addition to
the curiency of the countiy
But neithei the admin istiat'on nor the opposition
sustained me, and the pre< ious opportunity passed
unseized I then clearly saw the coming calamity
was inevitable, and it has neither aruved sooner,
nor is it greater, than what I expected
Such are the leading causes which have produced
the present disordered state of the currency There
are others of a minor character, connected with
the geneial condition of the commercial world and
the operation of the Execu'ive branch of the Go-
veinment, butwhich, oí themselves, would have
produced but little effect To repeat the causes, m
a few words, the vast increase which the tariff of
1824 and 1828 ga-v e to the fiscal action of the Go
vernment, combined with the causes I have enu-
merated, gave the first impulse to the expansion
of the currency These, in turn, gave that extra
ordinary impulse to overtrading and speculation
(they are effects and not causes) which has finally
terminated in the present calamity. It may thus be
ultimately traced to the connexion between the
banks and the Government, and it is not a little
remarkable lhat the suspension ofspecie payments
in 1810 in this countiy, and that oí 1797 ¡n Greaf
Britain, were produced by like causes
Theie is another icason against the union of the
Government and the banks, intimately connected
with that undei consideiation, which I shall next
proceed to state It gives a preference to one poi
tion of citizens over another, that is neither fair,
equal, nor consistent with the spirit of our institu-
tions
That the connexion between the bank and the
Government, the receiving and paying awav their
notes as cash, and the use of thepublic money from
the time of the collection to the disbuisement, is
the source of immense profit to (he banks, cannot
be questioned It is impossible, aa I hav e said, to
ascertain with any precision to what extent their
issues and circulation depend upon it, but it cei-
tamly constitutes a large pi opoi tion A singleillus
tration may thiovv light upon this point Suppose
the Government were to take up the veriest beggar
in the street, and enter into a contract with him that
nothing should be received in payment of its dues
or for the sales of its public lands m future, except
gold and silver and his promissory notes, and that
he should have the use of the public funds from the
time of their collection until their disbursement
Can any one estimate the wealth which such a con-
tract would confer i His notes would circulate far
and wide over the whole extent of the Union;
would he the medium through which the exchanges
of the country vv ould be performed, and his ample
and extended credit would give him a cortrol over
all the banking institutions and moneyed transac-
tions of the community The possession of a hun-
dred millions would not give a < ontrol more effec-
tual I ask, would it be lair, would it be equal,
would it be consistent with the spiut of our institu-
tions, to confer such adv antages on any mdiv ídual?
And if not on one, would it he if conterred on any
number'' And if not why should it be conferred on
any coiporate body of mdiv iduals í How can they
possibly be entitled to benefits so vast, which all must
acknowledge could not be justly confeired on any
number of unincorporated individuals i
I state not these views with any intention of
bringing down odium on banking institutions I
have no unkmd feeling tow ards them whatever I
do not hold them responsible foi the present state
of things It has grown up gradually, without
either the banks or the community perceiving the
consequences which have followed the connexion
between them My object i« to state facts as they
exist, that the truth may be seen in time by all.
This is an age of investigalion The public mind
is broadly awake upon this all important subject.
It affects the mteiests ancT condition of the whole
community, and will be investigated to the bottom.
Nothing will be left unexplored, and it is for the
interest of both the barks and of the community,
that the evils incident to the connexion should be
lully undei stood in time, and the connexion be
gi actually terminated, before such convulsions shall
ioUow as to sweep away the whole system, with its
advantages as well as its disadvantages
But it is not on'} between citizen and citizen that
the connexion is unfair and unequal It is as much
so between one poition of the country and another.
The c mnexion of the Government with the banks,
whether it be wi'h a combination of State banks
oi wilh a national insti ution, will necessarily cen-
tralize the action of the system at the principal
point ol collection and disbursement, and at which
the mother bank, or the head of the league ol State
banks, must be located From that point the whole
system, through the connexion with the Govern-
ment, w ill be enabled to control the exchanges both,
at home and abroad , and with it, the commerce,
foreign and domestic, including exports and im-
ports
After what has been «aid, these points will re-
quire but little illustration A single one will be
sufficient, and I will take, as mtheformei instante,
that of an individual
Suppose, then, the Government, at the commence-
ment of its operation, had selected an individual
merchant, at any one point in the Union, say New
York, ar d had connei ted itself with him as it has
with the banks, by giving him the use of thepublic
funds i i om the time of their collection until their
dishuisemem, and of leceivmg and paying awray,
m all Us transactions, nothing but his promissory
notes, except gold and ->ih ei Is it not manifest that
a decisive contiol would be given to the poit where
he resided, ovu all ihe others, that his piomissory
notes would circulate every where, through all the
ramifications of commerce, that they would regu-
]a*e exchanges, that they would be the medium of
pa} mg dnt} bonds, and that they would attiact the
imports and expoils of the country to the port
where such extraordinary facilities were afforded I
If such would clearly be the effec s in the case sup-
posed, it is equally clear that the concentration of
the currency at the same point, through the con-
nexion of the Government with the banks, would
have equal if not gi eater effects, and that, whether
one general bank should be used as an agent, or a
league of banks, which should have then centie
there To othei ports of the country, ihc tiiflmg
advantages which a blanch or deposite baik would
give, in the safe keeping of the public revenue,
w ould be as nothing, compared to the losses caused
to their commerce by centralizing the moneyed ac-
tion of the country at a remote point Othei gen-
tlemen can speak for their cw n sections, I can
speak with corfidenee of that which I have the
honor in part to lepresent The entire staple
States, I feel a deep conviction, banks and all,
would, in the end, be great gainers by the disse-
verance , whatever might be the temporary incon-
venience    If theie be any other section in which.
