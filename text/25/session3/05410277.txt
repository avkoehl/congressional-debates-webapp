25th Cong....3d Sess.
Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Evans.
Ho. of Reps.
President to communicate, if not incompatible
with the public interest,information íespeeting the
negotiation concerning the noi theastern bounda
xy On that resolution a debate sprung up,in which
you, su, largely paiticipated,and in which I took
a much humbler share Ihe document read by
my honorable friend [Mr Kenmedt] informs us
that these proceedings, little important as they
were, were communicated with great minuteness
to the Btitish Government A newspaper, con-
taining the debate, was forwarded to the Duke of i
Wellington, and his attention was particularly '
called to the fact that, of the eight membeis of
the House from Maine, thi ee only voted in favor
of the resolution, and five agatnst it Thank
God, I was not one of the five Sir Challes
Vauglian reminds the Duke of this circumstance,
and of the " apathy" which then appeared ti pie
vail m Mame on the subject, and of the willing-
ness thus manifested by the State to submit the
whole matter to the General Government
This was at the period when propositions of
the most dangerous and exceptionable character,
so far as ourrights were conceined, weie passing
between the two Governments, propositions foi
an adjustment, founded upon a departure fiomthe
tine north line of the tieaty, wholly unknown to
Maine at that time, and to the country Sir
Challes R Vaughan, taking flesh courage fiom
the appirent acquiescence of Maine, in the then
state of the negotiation, and the readiness which
five out of eight of its membeis heie manifested
f> submit all to the Geneial Government, pretty
distinctly suggests to the Duke the piopriety of
extending his jurisdiction over the whole terri-
tory He called his attention to the small ma
¡oiity by which the resolution was \oted in the
llou'e—to the fact that the President had declined
to communicate the infoimation sought for, and,
throughout the whole letter, evidently endcavoied
0  impiess upon the mind of the Duke of Wei
lington that the question was one to which very
little importance was now attached in this coun
try With this evidence fresh befoie us of the
eagerness with which our proceedings, our
speeches, oui votes even, are watched by Bntish
eyes and Bntish ears, I ask the honotable mem-
ber from Pennsylvania to consider with how much
moio couiage and zeal that nation will be likely
to push het pretensions, when sne finds a course
ofargumentpuisuid here calculated to strengthen
them on the pimupieshe has asseited'
Mr BIDDLC heie unci posed lie could
hardly believe it possible he hid been so much
misunderstood So fai fiom admitting the Pn'ish
"laim of light, he had e\pinss]y denied it lie
«nl maintained the light to be in Mame but the
oiound he had t tk n wis this thatoui Givem-
•nent, bv us acts, had countenanced the belli f on
he part of the Ihitish aiuhoiiues tint we weie
d s i ised to admit their claim, and that, stch
hav ngbeen the cise, we ought not too hastily oi
too halt, ily to resort then so undt islanding us
Mi LVANS resumed He was very fai firm

desues h it th s bill sh ill not piss fietlimtisit
eqim i ent to a dcclaratio i ot wat He is, thoie
foie, of opinion that the auilioiity of the Geneial
Government shou'd not be interposed to pievent
Gieat Ei it am fiom taking miluaiy occup ion of
the disputed teintory i i o her woids, that she
s! all be allowed to t iVe such possession, if she
pleases, and upon the ground tint our Govern
ment has given sufficient pretext to Gieat Butam
to adheie to het pretensions, by acquiescence m
them on our pait Now what I desneto submit
to the honoiable member's consideration is this
whether such a course of pioceding would not
be an entire submission to hei claim—to h°i claim
byaírreement—agreementfounded on her onginal
jiHisüicuon never sunendereel whether the use
e f such an a!<nime it is not calculated to stnnu'ate

B ttiuoilyi neleis it otill ti e moio dangeious
tisuir i dei c\e i tenpoiary possession and ju-
risdiction to Great Butam     If the right to the
territory be so incontestably our , how unspeak
ably hazardous is it to concede for one moment
that she has a right to maintain sovereignty over
it, until she chooses to set it apart as a grant to
us' I desue to carry out the consequences of
even the feeblest admissions, coming fiom a
source so discerning and sagacious as is the hon-
oiable gentleman from Pennsylvania and I again
put it to the House to consider whatcourse Gieat
Britain will be likely to puisue, if, m this Con
gress, her extiaoidmaiy pretensions find the
smallest favoi '
I again repeat if the House reject this bill, it
will he a virtual suriender to those pretensions
The Executive is committed—deeply committed,
and if we do not sustain him, we abandon the
high, impregnable ground on which  oui  rights
stand     But suppose, in point of fact, theie has
been any such agreement respecting juusdiction
as the Bntish Minister asseits     How long is it
to continue'    Is it to be forever binding'    Can
neither party abrogate it'   May we not, when
ever we please, inform the British Government
that we rescind it—that we claim jurisdiction our-
selves, and shall exert it' And if, after such no-
tice, Gieat Britain attempt to reinstate herself by
arms, may we not resist her, without being chargtd
with a violation of her lights in so doing'    How
are our rights ever to be maintained and respected,
but by a plain enunciation of them to the woild,
and a significant warning that they aie not to be
invaded with  impunity'    Is this  bill anything
moie'   We have repeatedly asserted our undoubt
ed u 'ht to the teintory, we have warned Gieat
Bntain that she has no pietense of sovereignty
or jurisdiction, either by agreement or by vntue
of hei ante revolutionaiy possession and ownci-
1 ship, oi in any othei way, and we have more than
once or twice or thtice assured her that any at   .
tempt to enfoice it would be íesisted    She is now
1 about to enforce it     She leaves us no alternative
With what face, then, can it be said that this is
a hostile movement      It is no othei wise hostile
than the othei party chooses to make it so      It is
puiely defensive     It is to íesistan inclusion, ind
the setting up of authority which the Bntish G>v-
ernment has been for yars admonished would be
resisted whenever attempted    It looks to milita y
prepaiation, indeed, but it looks also to peace
It piovides foi raising tioops and f i  the means
of war, but it also pioposes an embassy of con-
ciliation md peace      If ltgiasps the swoid with
ore h md, it extends the olive blanch in the othei

I a mode of diplomatic inteicouise, with a view to

,| p i son shall be selected foi this impoitant mission
known to  this countiy and known to Euiope,
commanding ti e eoi fidencc of all pai ties and sec-
tions here m his ability and integrity, one able to
pre e it our  chims to  the consideration  of the
Bntish Cabinet in that strong and unansweiable
I   maiim r which then mheient justice admits of, I
cannot doubt the lesult     Most happy shall 1 be
it such a one is selected foi this station, and if
his effoits for peace—peace without the sacufice
of oui  lights oi  our honor—aie clowned with
success
If I have omitted to notice any fact or argu-
| ment employed by the honorable membci fiom
1 Pennsylvania, I am not aware of it Possibly it
may be so, and if so, I shall regiet it I dosiic
to vindicate this bill and the State of Maine in
every particulai where I think defense necessary
oi piacticable
I now put to the honorable gentleman this ques
tion   what will >ou do in the present exigency '
J Will vou make no demonstration in behalf of our
I rights '   What can you then expect but that the
I   most arrogant demands of Great Bntain will be
|   ienewed and insisted on'  Will you do nothing'
I Will you leave Maine to heiself    Such is the
I   couise already predicted  by one of the Bntish
picsscs in this coui trv    The United States, they
I   say, will abandon Mime to the consequence of
hei own folly   We aie now to see how that is   I
ha\e alnaly told you that Maine is in arms, de
I   teiminid to maintain her rights    Sue is solemnly
I  pledged on this subject, she cannot retieat, sue
will most certainly mamtrin herself in the posi-
tion she has taken Will you stand by and see
her cut down* Wi'lany man say that is a íesuit
which this nation can witness without disgrace
and dishonoi ' You may look coldly on if you
will, but come or not come to her defense, she
will stand.    I say to her,
Stand' the ground's yoar own,ray bravesi
Will ye give it up like slaves'
Or do ye look for greener graves "*
The question for you is, whether she shall be left
alone battling for her rights'—whether you think
that is the way to preserve the peace of the coun-
tiy' You may see her trod in the dust by mili-
tary powei which she cannot resist, if you will.
You may see her cut off fiom the Union, and in-
corporated with the colonial possessions of a for-
eign Powei, but you shall not see her quaihn<*
before the enemy, nor abandoning the high giound,
she occupies, while she can lift an arm to uphold
her flag You aie bound, pledged, committed to
her defense You may recede, this House may
recede if it will, and if it does, this nation recedes
from its most solemn obligations. Do it if you
will Stand by, as all Europe did, calm, cold
spectators, while Poland was crushed to the earth
by an overwhelming military despotism, but take
with you the judgment which the world and his-
tory and impaitial postentywill pronounce upon
you, as it does upon all Euiope, that you were
recieant to your duty and youi honor
Mr SAL PONSTALL followed Mr Evavs on
the same day, m a speech, of which a leport was
published in the Globe of the 19ih of April
Aftei Mi S concluded this speech,
Mi EVA^S lephed, at some length, vindi-
cating the pioceedings of Maine, and advocating
the bill He denied that Mi Saltonstali had
spoken the sentiments of Massachusetts, and pro-
ceeded in an argument to show that the move-
ments now mad< in Maine were undertaken for
the benefit of Massachusetts as well as Maine,
and were only canymg out a couise of measures
commenced last year under the joint dnecuon of
the agents of both States, &c.
Saturday, March 2, 1839
The same subject being lesumed,
Mi SALTONVTALL rose for the purpose of
explanation Fiom what he had heaid in reply,
he must have been misunderstood—he knew the
couise of his lemaiks had been misstated He
was desirous that the views he had taken on a
question so impottantto his own State and to the
country should be distinctly understood
The committee have been cautioned (said Mr.
S ) not to suppose th it I have coirectly repie-
sented the opinions of Massachusetts     I did not
undertake to give the opinions of Massachusetts,
but my own \iews, on my own responsibility
¡My allusion to my situation as a Represéntame
| of that State, so deeply interested in this  ques-
tion, was a mere introductory remaik,and offeied
as a reason for my taking part in a discussion in
1 which so many were desnous to engage
J     Comments which I was surpnsed to hear have
been made on my remaiks upon the proceed-
' ings ol tin Chief Magistrate and goveinment of
Mame     On  that subj ct  the course  of my le-
I marks was this   I glanced at the history of this
I contiovcrsy from the beginning, and upon the
, main question—our risbts under the  tieaty of
17S3—Í expressed an opinion as clear and decided
1 as has been or can be given, that the right to the
! teintoiy in dispute was in the United States     I
' icferred to the pioceedings under that treaty, to
the tieaty of Ghent, to the subsequent pioceed-
I ings, and particularly to the resolutions adopted
I by Congiess at its last session, and I endeavoied
I to call the attention of the committee to the pre-
cise s ate  of the claim at the time of the recent
movement in Maine
As to the claim of the Goveinoi of NewBruns-
' wick to occlusive possession and jurisdiction, my
general view was similar to that so ably piesented
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr Bid-
dj e ] I did not contend that there had, in fact,
been an agiecment or unders andmg between 110
Goieiiimeiits ot the two nations, as has been
assumed by Sir John Ha-vey, but I lefeired to
i \ anous documentb to show that the claim tiatt
