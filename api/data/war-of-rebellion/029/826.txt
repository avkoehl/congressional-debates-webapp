orders were received to do so at all hazards, it being called the key of the battle-field.

On Wednesday evening the entire brigade was brought up, having been re-enforced by a section of Lumsden's battery, commanded by Lieutenant [J. A.] Chalaron,* and a section of Washington Artillery, commanded by Lieutenant [E.] Tarrant. Semple's battery having taken up a position 600 yards in rear and left of us, a section of this battery replaced for one night Cobb's battery. During the week which followed we were kept here bivouacking in the mud and rain, and exposed to an incessant fire from the enemy's batteries and sharpshooters. A temporary and slight intrenchment was made, which, to some extent, protected the batteries; but the casualties at this place were not inconsiderable [amounting to 40 men], as stated above, and as will appear by reference to regimental reports.

During the engagement of Wednesday, time and again did the gallant Cobb, aided by his not less gallant lieutenants and three sections before referred to, disperse the enemy's columns as they endeavored to succor that part of their force engaged with the right of the left wing of the army. Indeed, during every day of our occupation of this hill our battery did signal service, frequently driving the enemy's artillery away and often dispersing his infantry. All this while the brigade covered more than a mile of front with skirmishers and pickets, using for that purpose from six to ten companies daily. These advanced to within 100 yards of the enemy in many places, and were hourly engaged.

On this hill Cobb's battery lost 8 men; Colonel Hunt, Ninth Kentucky, lost a most excellent officers killed [his adjutant, Henry M. Curd], whose death all lament, and wounded Capt. Joseph Desha, whose subsequent conduct elicited universal praise, together with Lieutenants [G.] Lewis, Company A, and [H.] Buchanan, Company H, wounded, and 3 other officers and 23 privates. [See detailed statement.] Colonel Lewis, Sixth Kentucky, lost slightly here; Lieutenant-Colonel Stansel. Forty-first Alabama, lost here two of his best officers and several men; the Second and Fourth Kentucky, though equally exposed, lost less at this point.

On Friday, the 2nd instant, at 3 o'clock, the order came to move to the right and front, and form the left of the front line of General Breckinridge's division to attack that portion of the enemy's left which were posted in the woods and ravines on the south side of Stone's River, opposite the extreme right of our army, which was done. Colonel Hunt, with his regiment, remained at the hill, ordered to support the battery, and six companies were kept out as before on picket duty, thus leaving us for the fight about 1,200 men.

Stone's River in front of this new position runs nearly parallel with the new line, but inclines to the point occupied by the right of this brigade, when, by a change of direction to the north, it runs for some distance nearly perpendicularly from the front of our line. At this point, whence the river changes its direction northward, is a skirt of woods and an elevated ridge, behind which and in the ravine and woods the enemy lay concealed. To the right of our line the enemy were likewise posted in a woods, thus outflanking us. One thousand yards in the front from this first skirt of woods is a ford of the river, while the bank of the river opposite us, between the ford and point of attack, overlooks the

*The above account of commanders of sections of artillery is undoubtedly incorrect, as Chalaron belonged to Washington Artillery and Tarrant belonged to Lumsden's battery.
