HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,McDonald's, September 20-6.35 a. m.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

General Negley's division has been ordered to General Thomas left. The general commanding directs you to fill the space left vacant by his removal, if practicable.

The enemy appears to be moving toward our left.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

Immediately upon receipt of this order, Major-General Sheridan and myself rode to the position vacated by General Negley's division. We found nearly all this space already occupied by General Wood's division. He informed me that his left rested on General Brannan's right, and that his orders were to close up on General Brannan.

Discovering that a portion of the rude barricades on Wood's right was not occupied by our troops, I ordered General Sheridan to bring forward one of his brigades to fill up the space between Wood's left and Wilder.

On turning from this position I met General Davis' division marching toward and about 100 yards from the vacant barricades on Wood's right, he informing me that he had been ordered there by General Rosecrans. Seeing his position and knowing the advantage of occupying the barricades at once, I directed him to place one brigade there, holding the other in reserve.

On the arrival of the brigade from Sheridan's division it was posted in column on Davis' right and rear as his support. Davis' instructions were to keep well closed up to the left.

These instructions being just completed, the following order was received:
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, September 20, 1863-10.10 a. m.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

General Thomas is being heavily pressed on the left. The general commanding directs you to make immediate disposition to withdraw the right so as to spare as much force as possible to re-enforce Thomas. The left must be held at all hazards even if the right is withdrawn wholly back to the present left. Select a good position back this way and be ready to start re-enforcements to Thomas at a moment's warning.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

Within five minutes after the receipt of the above order, and instructions given to carry it out, the following order was received:
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, September 20, 1863-10.30 a. m.

Major-General McCOOK,

Commanding Twentieth Army Corps:

The general commanding directs you to send two brigades of General Sheridan's division at once and with all possible dispatch to support General Thomas, and send the third brigade as soon as the lines can be drawn in sufficiently. March them as rapidly as you can without exhausting the men. Report in person to these headquarters as soon as your orders are given in regard to Sheridan's movement.

Have you any news from Colonel Post?

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.

This order was executed at once. Two brigades of Sheridan's di-
