Major CARLETON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report for the information of the general commanding that I ordered Colonel Kerwin, commanding Thirteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry Volunteers, to send an officer and detachment of men in pursuit of the outlaws who committed the robbery of men and officers, heretofore reported, with orders that they pursue, overtake, and theat the same as outlaws. Captain O'Shea, with picked men, took their trail, following day and night, and at 2 a. m. 18th instant came up with their camp on the border of South Carolina. He surrounded their camp. The guerrillas were desperate characters, fought hotly, and asked no quarter. Not one of their number escaped the penalty of their crimes, and on their bodies and in their camp Captain O'Shea found the whole of the money, watches, and other property taken from our men and officers. I am happy to state that none of our men were killed in the fight, and but one wounded. It is believed this result will prove a warning to others and inspire confidence throughout the country.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS T. NEATH,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Commanding Cavalry Brigade.
