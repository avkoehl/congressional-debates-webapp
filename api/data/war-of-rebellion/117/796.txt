MILITARY PRISON, Alton, Ill., [July 1,(?)] 1862.

General S. PRICE,

Commanding First Division, Western Department, C. S. Army.

DEAR GENERAL: We, the undersigned, members of the C. S. military corps and citizens of the Confederate States of America, respectfully ask through our Government to immediately consider separately and collectively our situations as prisoners of war, now held as criminals by the United States Government and incarcerated in the Alton Penitentiary for executing the orders of the Confederate Government as directed by her commissioned officers. Our treatment by the Federal authorities is and has been of such a nature that we deem it absolutely necessary to appeal to our Government to throw around us her safeguard and relieve us from the horrors of a long imprisonment and the execution of our sentences.
