throw the train down an embankment, but it had been calculated for a train going south, and ours broke if off without damage. The purpose apparently was to destroy Grant on his way to Bridgeport.

No change in the situation here. Ten days' rations on hand. Thomas firmly resolved to hold at all events. Rain heavy since midnight and roads worse to-day than yesterday.

An immediate movement for the occupation of Raccoon Mountain and Lookout Valley is indispensable, but Hooker, though ordered ten days since to concentrate his forces for the purpose, has not done so, but waits on the ground that his wagons have not arrived from Nashville. The fact is, however, that about one hundred have arrived, and, besides, Thomas will not allow him to take any wagons at all in this movement. But Hooker seems to show no zeal in the enterprise. It will necessarily wait somewhat for the arrival of Grant, who was not able to make the whole distance of 55 miles on horseback yesterday, but will get in before night.

The interior line of fortifications is so far advanced that General Smith tells me only one day's work more is needed to make them tenable, and the place temporarily safe with a garrison of 10,000 men, though the works will still be far from finished. The pontoons are done for a bridge across to Lookout Valley as soon as Hooker has moved into that position.

The change in command is received with satisfaction by all intelligent officers so far as I can ascertain. The sentiment of the troops I do not yet know about. Of course Rosecrans had many friends who are unable to conceive why he is relieved, and these report he is to command the Army of the Potomac. The change at headquarters here is already strikingly perceptible. Order prevails instead of universal chaos. General Thomas thinks enemy are moving up against Burnside.

Among the officers who most resolutely required the relief of Crittenden and McCook was General Palmer. It appears that he expected to succeed Crittenden, for on the consolidation he resigned. Now that the Fourteenth Corps has to receive a new commander I would respectfully recommend that Palmer's resignation be accepted. This will leave Reynolds the ranking major-general in this army next to Rousseau, who is so unfit that he cannot be considered.
