In case of a necessity compelling negro or white labor for the purpose of building fortifications, bridges, roads, or aiding transportation or other military purpose, it shall be the duty of the superintendent of negroes in that district to cause employment rolls to be made of those so compelled to labor and to p;resent said rolls as soon as the necessity ceases to the assistant, quartermaster of the district that the laborers may be paid; and the superintendent shall see that those that labor shall have proper subsistence, and may draw from the commissary of subsistence rations therefor. Any officer offending willfully against the provisions of this order will be dismissed the ser the approval of

And no negro shall be impressed into military service of the United States except under orders from these headquarters-by a draft which shall equally apply to the white and colored citizen.

X. The theory upon which negroes are received into the Union lines and employed, either as laborers or soldiers, is that every negro able to work who leave the rebel lines diminishes by so much the producing power of the rebellion to supply itself with food and labor necessary to be done outside of military operations to sustain its armies, and the United States thereby gains either a soldier or a producer. Women and children are received because it would be manifestly iniquitous and unjust to take the husband and father and leave the wife and child to ill- treatment and starvation. Women and children are also received when unaccompanied by the husband and father, because the negro has the domestic affections in as strong a degree as the white man and however, far South his master may drive him he will sooner or later return to his family.

Therefore it is ordered, That every officer and soldier of this command shall aid by every means in his power the coming of all colored people within the Union lines; that all officers commanding expeditions and raids shall bring in with them all the negroes possible, affording them transportation, aid, protection, and encouragement. Any officer bringing or admitting negroes within his lines shall forthwith report the same to the superintendent of negro affairs within his district so they may be cared for and protected, enlisted, or set to work. Any officer, soldier or citizen who shall dissuade, hinder, prevent, or endeavor to hinder or prevent any negro from coming within the Union lines; or shall dissuade, hinder, prevent, or endeavor to prevent, or hinder any negro from enlisting; or who shall insult, abuse, ridicule, or interfere with for the purpose of casting ridicule or contempt upon colored troops or individual soldiers, because they are colored, shall be deemed to be and held liable under the several acts of Congress applicable to this subject, and be punished with military severity for obstructing recruiting.

XI. In consideration of the ignorance and helplessness of the negroes, arising from the condition in which they have been heretofore held, it becomes necessary that the Government should exercise more and peculiar care and protection over them than over its white citizens accustomed to self-control and self- support, so that their sustenance may be assured, their rights respected, their helplessness protected, and their wrongs, redressed; and that there be one system of management of negro affairs; It is ordered, That Lieut, Colonel J. Burnham Kinsman, aide-de-camp, be detailed at these headquarters as general superintendent of negro affairs in this department, to whom all reports and communications relating thereto, required to be sent to these headquarters, shall be addressed. He shall have a general
