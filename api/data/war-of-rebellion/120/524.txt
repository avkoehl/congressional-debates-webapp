MERIDIAN, MISS., August 2, 1864.

General WINDER, Americus, Ga.:

I understand you contemplate sending 2,000 Federals, prisoners, to this department for safe-keeping. Owing to enemy's reported movements on my frontier I earnestly request that they shall not be sent at this time.

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding Department.

CHIEF SURGEON'S OFFICE, August 2, 1864.

Colonel CHANDLER:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following report of the sanitary condition of the C. S. military prison:

The number of sick on morning report is 1,305 in hospital and 5,010 in quarters.

The total number of deaths from the organization of the prison (February 24, 1864) up to date is 4,585.

The following table exhibits the ratio per 1,000 of mean strength during the different months:

Month. 	 Mean strength.	 Deaths. 	 Ratio per

 	 	 1,000 of mean

 	 	 strength.

March. . . 	 7,500	 283	 37. 4

April. . . 	 10,000	 576	 57. 6

May. . . 	 15,000	 708	 47. 2

June. . . 	 22,291	 1,201	 53. 87

July. . . 	 29,030	 1,817	 62. 7

Owing to insufficient hospital accommodation many are treated in quarters who should be in hospital. The present capacity of the hospital is for 1,400 sick. The hospital is situated in an oak grove, affording good shade. Through the hospital passes a stream, furnishing an ample supply of water for cleanliness; drinking water is obtained of good quality from wells and springs on the banks of the stream.

The tents are insufficient in number and not of proper size for the treatment of sick; most of them are the small fly tent and tent flies. There should be at least 200 hospital or 500 wall tents to properly accommodate the sick. It has been impossible up to this time to obtain straw for bedding, this not being grain-growing district; small crops of wheat have been raised this year, and efforts are being made to collect a sufficient quantity as soon as the present crop is thrashed; but there is lack of transportation at the post, and farmers are unwilling to hire their own teams for the purpose. The attendants are paroled prisoners, who, as a rule, are faithful in the performance of their duty, being actuated by the improvement of their own condition on removal from the stockade, and a fear of a return if negligent in the performance of duty, apart from a desire to serve their own sick comrades. The number of medical officers, until the recent call of militia by the Governor of Georgia, was utterly inadequate; since that time a number of physicians have been employed by contract, and others have been detailed by the Governor to serve in the medical department.
