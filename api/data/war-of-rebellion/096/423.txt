fight last night, and say all of Heth's division attacked the right of Smyth, suffered severely, and fell back into their works again at once; that all Hill's corps came out and attacked the right of Smyth and McAllister's and Ramsey's brigades, and he thinks they suffered severely when they were repulsed.

HATCHER'S RUN, February 6, 1865-7.20 a.m.

Major-General WEBB:

Deserters from Gordon's, Mahone's, and Heth's divisions state all of Hill's corps and Gordon's division, of Early's old corps, formed the attacking force yesterday. Gordon's division was on their left, and Mahone's came up and supported it toward sunset. They say their troops fell back to their intrechments last night. I am about examining and sending forward some force to feel in our front.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 6, 1865-7.50 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The major-general commanding directs that you feel the enemy in your front and determine whether or not they are outside their line of works. In case you find them outside you will attack them at once and drive them within their works; but should you find that they are now posted inside their line the major-general commanding does not order an attack. It is not his design to make an attack upon their fortified line, but he does not think they should be permitted to occupy any ground outside of that line.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to Major-General Warren.)

HATCHER'S RUN, February 6, 1865-8.40 a.m.

Major-General WEBB:

As soon as I had arranged with General Warren I rode down to Mott, where I am now, to send out reconnaissance from him and Hartranft and attack if I found the enemy outside their works. Your telegram to that effect reached me just as I was arriving at Mott's headquarters. I have ordered out the reconnaissance and directed all my troops to be ready to attack.
