* native sovereign^ of tbe S atts remains complete,
and «hines forth untarnished by assertion and
usage, or by infringement submitted to as the choice
of evils To this hour I retain the opinion that the
present Executive has represented Democratic
principles fairly and well, and therefore I have
coBtmned ray support thereto
Such, sir, is my political creed That it was al-
ways such I will not say Ten years ago, when I
was as honest, but I think not so well informed, as
I now am, I was a latitudmsnan—a Pedetalist If
any one jeers ma for changing, 1 will tell him that
fools never change, and that wi«e men do some-
timfs The change of opinion in referenee to my-
self has been gradúa1, hone t, and complete. It
ha« net been with, but agamt wind, tide, and the
stream.
A word as to the coming Administration, and I
will have dore. If Pres'dent Harrison shall be
found a strict constructionist—if he shall withhold
his countenance from those unconstitutional and
dangerous measures which have ever been pressed
upon the nation by latitudinanans, I will support
bis administration, and encourage others to abstain
from opposition But I must not be expected to
support his administration if he shall lend Execu-
tive influence in furtherance of the chartering of a
national corporation, or systems of expenditure
giving rise to a necessity for the creation of a pub-
lic debt
[Mr Jenifer of Maryland here asiied Mr Wick
under what clause of the Constitution he [Mr W ]
claimed authority for Congress to appropria e mo
ney upon the Cumber'and road ]
Sir, (said Mr Wick,) the Cumberland read is a
military road, essential ior the common defence
[Mr Wise. Mr Jefferson *aid it was a mili-
tary road ]
Mr. Wick Ye¿' Mr Jefferson called it a
military road, and who will say that h" was not a
strict and literal cons'ruer of the Cons ltution? Sir,
it is a military road Its construction is necessary
for the transportation of arms, munitions, and pro-
visions, and to the march oí armies to that Western
frontier upon which your policy has—wisely, be-
cause you could do no better—located the fragments
of a hundred tnbet, who may, at any momen', un-
sheath the ¿nife and flmg the tomahawk And be-
yond interpose between you and the Pacific a hun-
dred dher tribes, with whom many a sanguinary
struggle may be expected Nor is this all You
may yet have to grapple wi h the power of the two
greatest empires on earih, in a contest for the Pa-
cific coast S r, you may deny appropiiations for
that road now You may close your ear> to ihe
voice of reason and of justice, but you will yet
complete that thoroughfare to the great ocpan You
may incommode the pre-ent generation W refn ing
to do that bow wh eh might b^t er be now done
than hereafter But sou will yet ob y the ccre-
mands of nature and necessity

gress, he could njt vote for an election, and he

soluti n
I Mr MERRICK said the Senate on a lo mer day
had thought fit to mat-e a 'iberal grant to the wid„w
I of rne late Serge?n1-a-Arms, that was very good
in itself, but it afforded ro good reason why they
| should dispeise with a Sergeant at-Arms     The
j office was vacant, and it was proper that it should
' be filled, and he therefore moved that they proceed
|  to fill it
Mr KING expressed his surpr s  that thegen-
I tleraan nad thought pioper to bring foiward this re-
solution at the close of this Executive ^e sion.
Tney had a law flung the time of th* election ot
th-nr officers, and that i-as at tne coam^ncmeiit
of the n xt session of Congress.
Mr YOUNG-, wuh the permission of toe Sena-
tor from Alabama, interposed for the purpose of
placmg before the Senate the precise terms of the
rul", which he read as follow.
' Run, 49 Tne Secre ary of the Senate, the Ser-
geant-at Arms and Doorkeeper, and the Assi tant
Doorkeeper, shall be caosen on the second Mon-
day of the first session of the 21st Congress, and on
the same day of the fi st s-s'ion of every <.ucce«dmg
I  Congress "
Mr KING said ¡hat wis the law to * hich he
alluded, which was binding on th Senate as re-
garded those omcrs He knew gentlemen =aid
there was a vacancy in consequence of the death of
Judge tíaight He and his political fnen is knew
the f„ct, but though tbey had had the power when
the vacancy occurred, they dil not deem it obliga
tory to go into an elec ¡on They ( he De-nocratic
paity) ac ed fairly to'-^rds  the party tnat  as n
I be thi majon y after the 4tn of March, and ne
as¿ed witn what propriety they cou d roatie this
election and go before the country, after giv nato
the widow of their late officer the whole ^aiarv to
the close of the year, when there was nrt a particle
of business to be done by the new incumbent iho
ever he might be? It was n thing under the sun
but to give a salary when the officer was not wanted
and when there were no dut es to be performed
If this was the "reform" that had been piomised,
the n w Administration would not hive much to
boast of Here an fficer of th  Senate, not wanted,
was to be forced on them metüy to give him the
salary No gen le^tan coull get up and say that
officer was wanted, and if no , he a^ked why elect
him' Could thev gtt alón? up '0 the close of the
lale busy and excitpd session with their present offi-
cer--, and could tbev not close this extra session—
for he hoped n would be closed that or the succe '-
mg day—withou an addit onal one' It t us wai
to be a specimen of what was to b° expt c ed fro n
the new majority, he would teil thorn tint many
estimabk citizens who gafe their su port 'o th *
expectation or "Retrenchm nt" a id ' Preform "
would turr *wa/ from them with s->r iw and re-
gret. But they were amenable o the people, <ui 1

Mr^CLAY of Ke tuck/ s„iJ ready 11 appeared
to ¡Mm gentleovn on the oih"r side we e di pjsed

LOn what authority did he :;enth-man from A'a-
f bama ver¡U¡" to as'ert that mis es lutnn \\s *o
be psss"d to ma'i" a place ft r a favorite?
Mr KINS. The fact u-elf
Mr CL4Y There was rone l-leie was an
office with certain du íes attached to 1 , that office
] was va ant It me office were unnecessarj, bi ng
forward a proposition t<> dispense with it—a'togetner
abolió it—and if that was ('one, he undtr 0"k to
say that they (the presen' majority) shoul 1 not
h 1 the office while the proposition to dispense with
it altogether, was un er consideration Here was
an office with dutie atta-hed to it no-f there
mi°htbe, and m all probability would be, anexta
session There was no official announcement, and
he spokí only on common rumor, and on m'orrnauon
attributed to the President of the united States him-
self, in some remarks on a r°cent visit to Richmond
Was it not then of consequent  that the office be
filled, and that the officer should b come familiar
with the ("uttes of that office before he was called
to n?   The  salary   was—what?    Some  $1500
Well, if there should be an extra session, he be-
lieved no gentleman would deny that there should
not be a Sergeant-at Arms, and, if there should be
an ex ra session two months hence, and the «alary
be #1500, it was an affair of $350. Now, it was
nt t in little matters of this sort—it was in. great
and important sources of expenditure—those mon-
strous leaks in the Treasury which had left it dry
—it was in reforms of that sort, by which the Ad-
mmistrati >n coming into power was to benefit the
country Butgrnttemen told them they had used
the salary m a grant to the family of the late Ser-
geant-at-Arms that is, that those having the power
had given the «alary to the widow of the late Ser-
geant at-Arms, and because they had exer-
cised their charity in this way, trie public
were not to be served by an officer whose
duties were necessary Wai  that the sort of
reason ng by whn-h they were to be dissuaded
from the performance of a necessary duty? He
(Mr Clay) did not complain of the exercise of this
caantable disposition, gentlemen had exercised it
towards the family of the la'e incumbent. Be it
so they (the Y/higs) had acquiesced. But he
deemed that no reason they should not fill the office,
the duties of which might be nece«sary, and in all
probability would he necessary, in foity, fifty, or
sixty days from this time Well, then, as to the
rule via ch had been alluded to on the other side it
was a standing rule, and for what purpose? To
bring the officers in review before the Senate, that
they might decide on their continuation id office
from time to time But did any body suppose that
they could not fill at another time a vacancy in the
offjc  occasioned by death? Why, suppose tbey
should fill this biennial office, and, two days after,
the officer should die could they not fill the va-
cancy before the expiration or the t#o years? Here
«as a vacancy, the duties of which, he repeated, in
a 1 human probab htv, would be necessary in a
short time, and t had been proposed to fill the of-
fice He hoped gentlemen on the other side, on a
reconsideration, would see it was not one out of
which any thing could be made by a protracted ar-
gument
Mr. KING said he had but one word to say to
the Senator, and that was, that there were no duties
to be per orroed after the adjournment of this ses-
sion, and therefore this—whether the salary were
great or small—was simply a question of salary to
a favonte Trie Senator had talked about Sena-
tors on this side givins away the salary to the fa-
mily of the late Sergeant at Arms Now, did not
the ht nor-tb'e Sen&tor know that the proposition
came frtm one of his own friends? [Mr White of
Indiana] ThM propes lion waa pressed on tie
good feel m of S na ors contrary to his (Mr
Kino's) judgment, and he did no' vote for
it He w* willing to vote tor what was
u nail/ pad fe fra burial of such an or-
ficei, ind then a'low hi=- farm y to bury him in its
ownwa), ind he «o s'ated H*> thought that was
ihe corree c ur,e, but h" honorable Senator's
(Mr Clay's,) fnencts, and a por'ion of his (Mr
King's) Ihou-hl chff renilv But did they (the
DnrnuraK) sei?e npn th«- o rcumstance, when
he\ xere 11 the maja ty, and fill the vacancy?
No the/ acre1 in g< od faith, and they expressed
iK«m e ves >n good faite thít the vacancy should
mt be filled, as the present Doirkeeper had agrreed
lo di charge he duties, and it was not filled.
TieSeiator (Mr Clay) seemed to forget himself
n his ever anxiety to regulate and control every
thing a his will and pleasure Did they (Mr
KiPgN friends) offpr to fill the office? Had they
nv.thepo-ver to fill the vacancy? They had, but
hi/ left it t) ihe p esent majority to exercise their
right and their duty at the proper time, but they
iMr King and hi< friends) did not think that, at
this- ex ra se '-ion, it would be brought forward,
simply to mle a place, ard to give a salary He
was no to be t vitted with the exercise of improper
liberal ty to wards the family c f the late Sergeant
at-Arms He was wi ling to d) all that it was
right and proper to do, bu' beyond that, he was not
willing to go, beyond! that, as he conceived, the

ELECTION OP SERGEANT-AT-ARMS
DEBATE IN IHE SENATEv
Monday, March 8, 1841          \
Mr MERRICK mov*d to take up the resoÍHÍion
submitted by him ^n Saturday, to proceed to the
election of a Sergeant at-Arms to the Senate         '
Mr BUCHANAN sa(d he should vo'e against the
reso ution After the de ith of Jud¿e Haight, a strong
app al Was made to th is bod / en behilf ot his widow,
and arrangements were made by which <he u>as
to receive his salary for the eutire t rm fi r which he
was elected, and the Assistant Doorkeepr r at that time
agreed to discharge the duties of Sergeant at Arms
This course was adopte 1 from motives of the
purest philanthropy and justice that the Qovern-
might not pay two salaries, and jet that the
widow might receive twat of which she stoid so
much m need And now at the close of th s ses
sion, when there was no earthlv use for a S r
geant-at-Arms, why should they impose on the
i Treasury a double salary? When the Democratic
Senators had the power, they refrained from using
it, and determined not to elect a Sergeant-at-Arm«,
thsy agreed to do without this officer, and now,
when no reason for the election exists—when they
