1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
I
desired by certain citizens of Louisiana to pre-
sent a pinion protesting against the reception of
the Representatives from that Statu whose creden-
tials were presented this morning. I move that it
be referred to the Committee of Elections, to
whom the application presented this morning was
properly referred.
The motion was agreed to, and the petition was
referred accordingly.
EXCHANGE OF PRISONERS.
Mr. PENDLETON. I offer the following
resolution:
Resolved, That tlie President of the United States be !
requested to communicate to this House, if not incompati-
ble with the public inteiest, the report made by Colonel
Thomas M. Key of an lntnvicvv between himself and
Geneial HowelfCobb on the 14th day of June, 1^02, on the
bank of the Ohickahomuiy, by autbotityof the War Depart-
ment, on the subject oi the exchange of prisoner oi -war.
The SPEAKER. This being a call for execu-
tive information, unanimous consent is requiicd
to consider it on this day.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I object.
The SPEAKER. The resolution then lies
over one day under the rule.
TARIFF AMENDMENT.
Mr. COX. I oiler the following resolution,
upon which I demand the previous question:
Resolved, That to levseu the cost ot the nocturnes of
lite, the UiifF upon cotiee, sugar, tea, and similar articles
should be reduced either bv the pa\ luent o! an cu-toms in
the papei ciuieticy ot tlie Government instead ot gold,oi ij
by a modification of the tanlf so that an ad icccn em and ;;
not a specific duly bo hud upon s-aiu aim le>, and that the
Committee of Ways and Means be re(pic«UM to ouMdei i
the above proposition \\ ills n vu vv to legislative action. |
Mr. STEVENS. Do I understand tliat this j
is a reference simply to the committee' Because j
the resolution seems in the first place to affirm i
a proposition, ft the gentleman will modify itso j
as to say " that the Committee of V/aysand Mean* [
he instructed to inquire into the i xpedieixy ,"&c., i
I shall have no objection to it. j
Mr. COX. The design of the resolution is to j
refer this proposition to the committee for their
consideration, and with a view to report a bill if
they think favorably of the pioposition.
Mr. STEVENS. The first part of the resolu-
tion affirms that this ought to be done. I tiiink
the resolution should be modified a little.
Mr. COX. 1 will modify the lesolution in any
way the gentleman suggest.*. I should be very
glad to have his aid in tno matter.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 move, then, to modify it so
as to say " that the Committee of Ways and Means
inquire into the expediency," &c.
Mr. COX. i have 110 objection to that. I will
put the resolution in sucii shape as the gentleman
suggests.
Mr. STEVENS. Let what 1 suggest precede
the affirmation of the resolution.
Mr. COX. Yes, sir.
Mr. DAWES, i would like to hear ttie les-
olution lead as modified.
Tile modified resolution was read, as follows:
