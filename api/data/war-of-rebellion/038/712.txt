General JOSEPH E. Johnson, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

Scouts from near Memphis, April 1 report all boats at Memphis pressed. Thirty left Saturday and Sunday empty, going down; possibly intend re-enforcing Rosecrans. Enemy still in force on Mississippi and Tallahatchee. Loring reports re-enforcing on latter.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE WEST, Tullahoma, Tenn., April 3, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON,Commanding Department Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana:

The following reply to your letter of the 25th ultimo is directed by General Johnson:

The recent transfer of [J. C.] Sullivan's DIVISION from WEST to Middle Tennessee does not indicate such a movement of the Federal forces in Tennessee toward Mississippi as you seem to indicate. L In the present aspect of affairs, General Van Dorn's cavalry is much more needed in this department than in that of Mississippi and Eastern Louisiana, and cannot be send back as long as this state of things exists.

You have now in your department five brigades of the troops you most require, viz, infantry belonging to the Army of the Tennessee. This is more than a compensation for the absence of General Van Dorn's cavalry command.

By command of General Johnston:

BENJ. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JACKSON, April 3, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

Scout reports, April 1, all boats pressed at Memphis; thirty left Saturday and Sunday empty, going down. Have you observed any increase or movement?

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 3, 1863.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON:

Moore's brigade cannot be withdrawn from Loring. Leaving an ample guard at Big Black and Four-Mile Bridges, draw in General Green's brigade, and send one forward from Vicksburg. How many troops you shall send is left to y our discretion. You must keep an agent at the depot to report the arrival of ammunition and other things destined for your command.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
