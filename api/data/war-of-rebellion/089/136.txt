Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

If the deserters from MacRae's and McGowan's brigades are still at your headquarters, will you endeavor to ascertain from them where the rest of Heth's and Wilcox's division are, and send any other information of the position of the enemy's troops you have gained to-day? It is desirable to ascertain whether all of Hill's corps, as well as Johnson's division, of Beauregard's troops, are still south of the Appomattox.

Chief of Staff:

Says that McGowan and Lane were here yesterday; that when they left the intrenchments before Petersburg Scales was north of the James and Thomas north of the Appomattox. The other belongs to MacRae's, and says positively that MacRae, Davis, and Cooke were here yesterday, and does not know whether Archer was away or not; thinks not. They do not know anything of Johnson's troops. Owing to a change in provost guard these men were not sent up this morning. I have heard nothing later from General Willcox.
