two posts. I am now holding a hill just outside the pass,but if crowded too hands shall fall back into the pass. We drove the enemy's pickets to within half a mile of Acworth this morning, but while we were doing so ours were driven in on the Laughing Gal road and we hauled off. I shall feel again to-morrow morning, and with more confidence, as Garrard has arrived. I inclose a rough topographical sketch* of the road we traveled over yesterday and of this point, and also a sketch* made by one of my orderlies of the Etowah bridge. The right-hand pier should be detached from the abutment.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, June 2, 1864.

General McPHERSON:

General Schofield will push his column east from a point near the cross-roads and Burnt Church, with the purpose of pushing our way toward the railroad at some point in front of Acworth. If you can get your batteries placed so as to get a converging fire about the New Hope Church, I want you to open by volleys if you hear the sounds of battle up here, and always, if a chance offers, break the line and make a lodgment of the enemy's parapet.

Yours,truly,W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
