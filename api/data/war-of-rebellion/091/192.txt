COMMANDING OFFICER 17TH WEST VIRGINIA INFANTRY,

Just received a telegram from General Halleck directing me to stop the Seventeenth at Grafton. You will therefore remain in the cars and be ready to move to any point you may be required. Please inform me how many men you have, what you are armed with, and how much ammunition you have.

CLARSKBURG, September 27, 1864. (Received 10.20 a. m.)

Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

All right at 8.30 this morning. Nothing further heard from Weston; wire works to Beverly, but calls on Buckhannon are not responded to. Started an operator toward Buckhannon last night at 11 o'clock; have not heard from him.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel.

CLARKSBURG, September 27, 1864. (Received 10.20 a. m.)

Brevet Major-General KELLEY:

9.40 a. m. rebels entered Buckhannon, so says operator there, but we have suspicions that the rebel operator has been working from there all the morning. The wires are down again.

N. WILKINSON.
