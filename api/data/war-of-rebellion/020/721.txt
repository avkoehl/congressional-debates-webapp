CHARLESTON, S. C., December 16, 1862.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Dispatches from General Whiting confirm your dispatch. Reports cutting of Wilmington Weldon Railroad at Milton. Have detached a division, one-half of which already at Wilmington; rest will reach Whiting in morning. What is strength of General Smith? General Cooper has cipher.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

DECEMBER 16, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD:

It appears we cannot get communication with Goldsborough. The telegraph must be cut. I have ordered a portion of my cavalry to Kenansville (see map), with orders to observer the enemy beyond Magnolia, where I have a telegraph station. According to orders I now report to you. My transportation here is very small on the railroad.

W. H. C. WHITING.

DECEMBER 17, 1862.

General BEAUREGARD;

The enemy are burning all the small bridges on the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad as far as Goshen, or Faison Depot. Appears to be a cavalry raid, reported 600 strong. This indicates that they either fear an advance by us from that road or they do not propose to use it in attacking Wilmington. I have so little cavalry (three small companies) that I can afford no resistance so far from the city. Do you hear from G. W. [Smith]?

W. H. C. WHITING.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 17, 1862-11.30 a. m.

Brigadier General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

Heard nothing from G. W. [Smith] for eighteen hours, but War Department says he is being re-enforced. Can not form junction with him? Shall I send 50 wagons and teams by rail for my troops or can you procure them?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 17, 1862-11.30 a. m.

Brigadier General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

War Department reports serious fighting near Goldsborough. Enemy repulsed with heavy loss; ours not so. Can you not arm a train with infantry and one field pieces and have careful reconnaissance made up to burned bridges? In such case platform should be carried for disembarking field piece when required.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
