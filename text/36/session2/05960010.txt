APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Report of the Postmaster General.

results that the authority was given for the ap-
pointment of delegates to this International Con-
gress. Its action was, therefore, looked to with
much interest, and the most beneficial results
were anticipated from it. I regret to say that
these expectations were all disappointed, and
from a cause which it is not the province of this
report to discuss. The Hon. A. B. Longstreet,
of South Carolina, was the only delegate from
the United States who took his seat in the Con-
gress. I herewith submit his report, showing
the reason of his withdrawal therefrom on the
first day of its session. It is only necessary to
say that the withdrawal of Judge Longstreet
from the Congress, and his refusal to return to its
deliberations, received the entire approval of his
Government.
The report of the Superintendent of the Coast
Survey, presenting the operations of this service
for the last fiscal year, will be submitted to Con-
gress at an early day.
The accompanying reports from the various
bureaus of the Department, marked from A to L,
contain a detailed statement of their operations
during the last fiscal year.
The general operations of the Treasury De-
partment, since my last annual report, have been
of the most satisfactory character. The country
had gradually recovered from the revulsion of
1857, and its healthy and prosperous condition
was felt in the relief thereby afforded to the pub-
lic finances. Until within a short period, I had
confidently expected to present to Congress at its
presentsession a gratifying statement of the finan-
cial condition of the Government. A different
result, however, has been brought about by causes
which could not be foreseen, and, if foreseen,
could not have been averted by any action of the
Department.
All which is respectfully submitted.
HOWELL COBB,
Secretary of the Treasury.
Hon. William Pennington,
Speaker of the House of Representatives.
Report of tlie Postmaster General.
Post Office Department,
December 1,1s60.
Sir: I have the honor to submit the following

Compared with the service on the 30th of June

fifty-seven miles, and by steamboat increased
forty-two miles; the coach and inferior mode of
service in this section having been merged into
one class at the last letting, styled u star," or

The increase of business in this Department,
from the commencement of the Government, in-
dicates the growth of our countiy in a striking
manner. At its formation, in 1789, there were but
75 post offices in operation; in 1800, there wore
903; in 1810, 2,300; in 1820, 4,500; in 1830,
8,450; in 1840, 13,468; in 1850, 18,417; and in
1860, 28,498.
