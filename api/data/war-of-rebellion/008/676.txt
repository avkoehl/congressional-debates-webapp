Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Just returned from Tennessee. General Pope's movement has been a glorious success. Captured the rebel general and nearly all his forces are prisoners. They will number about 5,000. Over 100 pieces of heavy artillery at Island Numbers 10, band along the river shore a large amount of arms and property of every description. The rebels sank six steamers. Will endeavor to have five of them raised. If transportation arrives to-morrow or next day we shall have Memphis within ten days, and General Pope can co-operate with General Grant at Corinth in wiping out secession. Captain Walke, of the gunboat Carondelet, is enlisted to great credit for his efficient co-operation with General Pope to effect the crossing of the river.
