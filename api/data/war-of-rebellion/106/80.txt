From Arivaca to Pitiguito there is always abundance of grain. None need be carried by trains, and grain can be raised on about twelve deserted ranches between San Xavier and Arivaca. In Sonora along the Altar River it can be had at a maximum of 2 cents per pound at any time, and generally for half that price. Hay can be procured on both routes for 1 cent per pound at most. There are about 35,000 fanegas (150 pounds eqch) of wheat raised on the Altar River annually, and 8,000 fanegas each of corn and barley. Sugar-cane grows in perfection. The wheat is very superior. Wheat is harvested in June, corn in November to tuscon for 3 cents per pound. It costs the Government 15 cents for every pound laid down in Tucson now by way of Fort Yuma, and that without taking into consideration the bad condition in which supplies are received and the extratordinary waste and leakage unavoidable. Besides, it takes nearly double the time it would by way of Libertad. A worse road than the greater part of that from Fort Yuma to Tucson does not exist for animals and means of transportation. A more disagreeable could not be imagined.
