purpose of the change.
Mr. MOORHEAD. The Committee on Na-
val Affairs believe they can effect some consider-
able reductions. I can inform my friend from
Massachusetts [Mr. Delano] that it does not
affect the armory at Springfield. [Laughter.] ^
Mr. DELANO. I did not anticipate that it did.
I did not know, however, but that it might affect
the foundery at Pittsburgh. [Laughter.]

business.
The SPEAKER stated that the regular order
of business was the call of committees for reports
of a private character, beginning with the Com-
mittee of Elections.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I desire to introduce a bill
of a general character, in order that it may be

The bill directs the Secretary of the Interior to

as actingassistantad jutantgencral ofthc Excelsior
brigade, New York State volunteers.
Mr. DUELL. I ask that the bill may be con-
sidered at this time. It is a very meritorious case.
Mr. HOLM AN. The bill had better go to a
Committee of the Whole House.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman object
to its consideration at the time?
Mr. HOLMAN. I will hear the report read.
The report was read. It recites that Gilbert
was connected with the Excelsior brigade in May,
1861, and that shortly thereafter he was assigned
the duty ofacting assistant adjutant general, which
duty he continued to discharge till the last of
August, when he was granted a furlough, to report
at Camp Scott, on Staten Island, or at the head-
quaiters of General Sickles, at Washington; that
he did report, from time to time, to the 3d of May,
but was not assigned to duty, and that on appli-
cation to the War Department for pay for said
service, it was dccided that there was no authority,
under existing laws, by which he could be paid,
he never having been mustered into service.
Mr. HOLMAN. There are so many claims of
the same character that they ought to go to a
Committee of the Whole House.
Objection being made, the bill was ordered to
be so referred, and printed.
L. F. CARTER.
Mr. TRIMBLE, from the Committee on Pub-
lic Lands, reported back, with amendments, a bill

in surveys of the public lands in Oregon in excess
of his contract with the surveyor general of Ore-
gon, dated October 14,1860, and appropriates that
sum; provided that before any payment is made,
the work performed by Carter shall be tested in
the field by actual examination, under the direc-
tion of the surveyor general of Oregon, and any
correction made necessary to make it conformable
to the laws of the United States and the instruc-
tions governing the surveys of the public lands at
the expense of Carter, and the balance only of the
appropriation paid him after deducting the ex-
pense of inspection and correction, if needed, and
when the certificate of the surveyor general of
Oregon is filed with the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office that the survey is complete ac-
cordingto the law and regulations governingpublic
surveys.
Mr* F. A. CONKLING. I move the reference
of the bill to a Committee of the Whole House.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman object
to its consideration at this time?
Mr. F. A. CONKLING. I do.
The SPEAKER. A single objection carries
the bill to a Committee of the Whole House.
SCHOOL LANDS IN OHIO.
Mr. TRIMBLE, from the same committee, re-
ported a bill for the relief of congressional town-
ship No. 8, south of range three east, in Mercer
county, Ohio.
The bill authorizes the school trustees for the
time being of the township in question, to locate,
free of cost, except the usual fees of the Land
Office, a quarter section of land; and directs the
Secretary of the Interior to issue a patent there-
for, which may be disposed of for the use of the
schools within such township, and for no other
purpose whatsoever.
Mr. TRIMBLE. I will explain the bill. By
the act of 1826, fractional townships are permit-
ted to select lands in proportion to the amount of
lands contained in those fractional townships.
This bill passed the House at the last session of
the Thirty-Sixth Congress, but it was not reached
in the Senate, and therefore it came up here again
and was referred to the Committee on Public
Lands. In examining the facts of the case, the
question as to the amount of land contained in this
fractional township arose, and we ascertained that
the amount was not quite sufficient to authorize it
to select the quantity of land which was granted
in the bill which passed the House at the last ses-
sion. That bill grunted a half section of land.
Under the act of 1826, to entitle a fractional town-
ship to a half section, it must contain more land
than this fractional township contained. There
are in it three thousand acres, or about that quan-
tity, which would entitle it to a quarter section.
This bill grants, therefore, only that amount of
land.
I will only remark, further, that the people of
this township did not apply for this land until
1860, and the bill for their relief failed to become
a law at that session for the reason I have stated.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read
a third time; and being engrossed, it was accord-
ingly read the third time, and passed.
Mr. TRIMBLE moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved to
lay .the motion to reconsider on the tabic.
The latter motion was agreed to.
POST ROADS.
Mr. BLAKE. The Committee on the Post
Office and Post Roads have instructed me to re-
port back House bill No. 392, to establish certain
post roads.
Mr. OLIN. I ask to have that bill read, reserv-
ing the right to object.
The SPEAKER. The Chair does not see that
it is a private bill.
Mr. BLAKE. Yes, sir; it is a private bill.
The SPEAKER. Only private bills can be
received on this call of committees.
TIIOMAS HOYNE AND OTHERS.
Mr. KELLOGG, of Illinois, reported back
House bill No. 314, for the relief of Thomas
Hoyne and others.
The bill was read. It recites the recovery of a
judgment in the circuit court of the United States
for the northern district of Illinois against Thomas
Hoyne and others, sureties of C. U. Pine, late
marshal for that district, for money advanced by
