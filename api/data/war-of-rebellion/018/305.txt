be seized and sunk immediately. Between Edwards Ferry and Washington General Wadsworth will cause their seizure. A guard to prevent the boats being raised again should be placed at each ferry at once.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, May 31, 1862.

Major General JOHN A. DIX,

Commanding Department of Maryland:

If you can spare the New York Seventh Regiment, and they would like to go to Harper's Ferry, you are authorized to send them. It is believed their spirit and discipline will have a good moral effect upon the troops about to advance on Jackson. Has the Carlisle battery arrived? Please answer immediately.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WASHINGTON, May 31, 1862 - 2.15 p. m.

General DIX, Baltimore:

Intelligence just received that the enemy were retreating from Harper's Ferry makes it needless to send the New York Seventh from Baltimore.

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS,Opposite Fredericksburg, May 31, 1862.

(Received 10.10 a. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Dispatch received. My scouting parties have both returned. At the fords at the junction of the Rappahannock and Rapidan there were no signs of the enemy having been there lately. From the south I learn that the enemy's forces that some time since were moving toward the river retired day before yesterday toward Richmond. Other reports of their concentrating beyond Spotsylvania Court-House are not reliable. My pickets report all quiet in front.

GEO. A. MCCALL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, May 31, 1862 - 3.35.

Brigadier-General MCCALL,

Commanding, Fredericksburg:

Are you about to withdraw from Fredericksburg; and, if so, why, and by whose orders?

A. LINCOLN.
