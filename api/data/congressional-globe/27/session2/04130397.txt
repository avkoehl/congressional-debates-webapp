«elf made out and read a list m which it was included It was,
therefore, he believed, the understanding of the House, when
the resolution be referred to was adopted, that this item should
be striken out He submitted to the Chair whether he was cor-
rect In his understanding of the resolution or not
The CHAIR decided thett. the item was not included in the
resolution, and that it was m order
Mr McKEONsaid that he shou'd submit to the decision of
the Chair, though he regretted thatit had come to that conclu
sion He teheved, however, that the Chair in giving thatdeci
sion was governed by ásense of piopnety He must, how-
ever, say that he could not give his assent to such an item as
©475,000, without some investigation He would like to know
if the chairman of the Committee of Ways and Means would
give them some mfoimation as to the items foi defraying the
expenses of the Supreme, Circuit, and District Courts of the
United Stater Had he any information in his possession tlidt
would enable them to judge how larg" a potion of this item
would he nece^saty, aal pamcu'arly in reference to the ex
penses of the court  m his district, (New York )
Mr FILLM0111Í said there had been some statements laid
on their tables re'ative to t^ose expenses oí" the Southern dis
tnctof JSew Yo.k, the Eabtein district oí Pennsylvania, and
some others
Mi. McKLON" said it was very difficult to say whether
extravagance had taken place in the adminibtration of our
courts of jus ice, but, comparing the Ju hciaiy of the United
States with that of New York, it appeared that there m tgt be
great extravagance He reierred to the item of expense for
printing, and to the difficulty "of making an exact estimate of
the expenses, but he was disposed to go for gues3mg down
wards, as the Secretary had guessed upwards He admitted
that they were in the dark on this subject, and submitted whe-
ther they should not take the s*fe side, and say, whsie this ex-
penditure was oyei half a million dollars, that they would re-
duce it $100 000
This item of printing was one which had been swelled up
enormously No one objected to the printing of the íecords,
and it was not expected that the judges of the United Mates
courts should lead the records m manuscript, but the quesaon
was, who was to pay for this printing1* In the courts of New
Yoik, the records were printed at the expense of the parties
themselves, and weie not only punted on betttr paper, but had
marginal leteiencesof the points oi the case Tins amount in
the Blue Bookapj eaied to be $.7,000 while a few years back it
was only three or four hundred The gentleman from fenuih
Caro'masaid theie wa3a cas^ mtbeSupreme Comt, in which
he was concerned, in which he had to pay $b0 do'lais for the
Ennting of seven pages only oí reconl Now he should like to
now if any thing was charged to the United States for piloting
thisrecord If t>o, there was aflagiant abuse to compel IIil
party to pay foi punting, when it had already been charged to
the United states At any rate they werem thedaik,and if hf
was obliged to gue&s. 'as the Secretaiy of the Treasuty had
done, he would be roi guessing downwards, and reducirg the
appropriation  at least #lu0 000 The chairman of the com
mittee would do him the ju uce to say, that a week ago he call
© 1 his attention to this item, and begged him to investigate it,
and collect all the facts necessary to enable them to understand
it He believed that the chairman had done all that was in his
powei, but still they were wholly m the dark When we see
theseexpenditures(said Mr McK ) advancing withsuch extra
ordinary rapidity, he would ask gentlemen if it was not hish
time to airest the evil He was for bringing them down $100,
000 All agieed that &uine reduction shotdd be made in that
branch oi the public service that had increased above all
others
Mr WfNTHROP concuned entirely with the gentleman
from New York |,Mr Bar^aed] that theonly manner in which
these expenses could be reduced was by an independent rrovi
«on of law It seemed to him that it would be well for the
Houseto draw more distinctly the line of difference between
appropriations and expenditmes A íeductton |of appiopiia
t ons did not tend to stop the expenses, at most, it only stopped
the payment If they cutoff $100,000 fiom this aprropnauon
the effect would be that m the next annual appropriation bill
they would have $ 100,000 aneatages to pay
Mr C J INGER&0LL was undorstoodto mqlune if the Se
cretary of the Treasury would date toexperd more than this
House appropn ue i?
Mr VWN1HROP It seemed to him that the Secietary
wouldnot dare to lepudiate the debts and that ii the doctrine of
the gentleman fiom Pennsylvania wete ciuied oat, it would
result hi nothing lesr than repudiation Unless the gentleman
followed uo this reduction by some independent collate! al s a
tutory piovisio i, there rould be \>o othei conseq lence fiom it
than to throw oyer so much arrearages to tht, next annual ap
priation bill

He appealed to gentlemen, to then candor, whether this sort
of discussion about the detail  of exist nglaws, which could not
be examined oi this appropriation bul, was profifab'e'i Re
form could only be effected by bringing in other independent
bills There might be some neul for reducing the expenses,
for lengthening the daily sessieqs of the courts, but this was not
thetimetodo u? Weie they in an appropriation bill to repeal
these laws? for if they reduced the appropriations, as proposed
by the gentleman fiom Pennsylyania,it was equal to a repeal
of the laws They must reform in separate bills They would
noverget through this bill if they enteied heie into this sort of
discussion of the details of existing laws It was impossible for
him to decide how much was wanting and therefore he must
act on the data furnished by thooe who had examined the sub-
ject

Mr B.OOS*,V&LT said he wjuh.not letam the committee

a mihion of dolíais on one subject This item contained as
large an appiopnation as was called fot by the State of New
York mall its branches—Executive, Legi-lative, and Judicial,
and yet they were told they could not «top one moment on it
This was an Hen pioposro? to insert ©475 000 in anappropua

The gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr Wivthrop] had ar-
gued as if they we'e going to stop, by a voteagdinst this item,
the administration ofjusticein this country and assumed vir
tually that they made no appror nation except by this item, for
getting that they had already passed over items to'he amou it of
©150 000 ior the j jdiciary
Mr WINTHRO^said the gentleman had misunderstood his
argument His remara was, that they would do nothing to stop
the judicial sy*temm cutting down th's appropriation, but that
thi fcy&tem would be is expensive as it ever was, and thewho'e
result wou'd be that aireaiages would be tluownoverto the
next appropriation bill
Mr ROOSEVELT apprehended that they would not have
the^e arteira^ps, if th^y did not \ rovide foi them This was
not an appropua'ion to pay oTicers wnose salaiies were de

Here wis a proposition to appropnate $475 000 m thi1  «ne

had said he could not deal in ¿etaifs What was their legislation
for, (a^ked Mr R) if they weie to deal in \asrue generalities?
He was foi specihe items This item of $475 000 they could
not look at, and yet they could look m'o tne $2 pei day for

With all the efforts he bal made he had been wholly unable
to form any judgment whether this item ough to be $475000,
$400U)0, ^r $200 000 There must be some hing wrong some
where, and if aent'einen wouidnot fuiribh them with light he

Mr SALTONalALL said the gentleman from New York
hail complained that they had no hgh , tnat the Committee of
Ways and Meaos had proposed enoi mous appropriations with
out furnishing the means to examine them He would ask the
gentleman to consider the object of the appiopnation, and
how far it was practicable to give the items
Mr ROOSEVELT said he had seen on his table in regard
to similar items of other Departments, contingencies stated
down to fifty cents foi hack hue Why could they not have
the^ame thma with legard to the ji.diciary'*
Mi SALTONSTALL, m reply to that, would say that those
were statements of expenditures that were past but it could

ine \ear under this part'cular head m thi- branchi of thepub. c
seivice, this Government had ever ana ned, was $355,000 and
that was the expenditure of last year  The appropriation for that
year wasbut $325,009, (he expenditure exceeding the appropti.
ation £30 000 The expendituie of 1840 was $300 000, an¿ &•
average expenditure per annum for the last eight yearffinext
preceding 1841, was $250,006, so that it will be seen Irom these
data that the expemiitme of 1841 exceeded the expenditure of
IbiO $o53000 This bill pioposes to appropriate $445,000 ftír,the
expenses of the current year, $90,000 more than the^xpeftdfture-
oi last year, which was, of all others, the year of the greatest ex-
travagance m the expenses, at least of this branch of the public
service It was admitted on ail hands that m the expenditure
of this branch of the public service there is great prodigality^nd
extravagance, and the wrong should be corrected
The Committee of Ways and Means asked thauhey Should
increase the expenditures to this amount above last year, and
the only reason assigned for it was, that the judges had ne-
glected properly to tax the bills of costs and expenses, which
it was their duty to dos as they were made by law the taxmgand
auditngofruersin that pamcular, that they had been remiss
in that part of their public daty The argument, traced out,
was that the judges had been remiss m that part of their pun-
he duty, and therefoie would continue to omit the performance
of it, and the afeases that had thus crept m would not only be
perpetuated, but increased Now^ to provide for theirconami-
mgtodo this it is proposed to increase the appiopnation.
" Is th s the entertainment to which we were invited" by this
Administration on ltb coming into power? It sounded to him
like an odd sort of retrenchment He should hold the majority
to their engagement to retrench the expenditures of the Govern-
ment, not because they had promised to do so, but because it
was necessary, and would keep the Government pure, and the
people relieved from,the burdens of unnecessary taxation. He
was in favorof the amendment, because it will tend to correct
these abuses, and does not withhold any appropriation due by
any law of the land
It seemed that $100 000 had been added íq this appropnaüo i
on account of the increase of business it was apprehended
would be thrown on the Federal courts on account oí ue banje-
rupt law of the extra senior, one of the bitter fruits, if theap*
piehension be well founded, of 'that od ous law and breach of
the Constitution Now it bhould be remembered, he added,
that while the bankrupt law might increase thebusmess of the
courts m the section of the Unou lying on this side of the
mouutam an mg this year, and perhaps the next, by the settle-
ment of tho land titles in the Western and Southwestern States
there was ¿v¿ would be a great and continued falling off, and de-
ci ease of the business of these courts on the other side of the
mountain, to T1 amount quite equal to any increase that might
be OGca^ onej by the passage cf that law*
Asan , hebankrui ts, bavirg been armed by this Govern-
ment Yv th the power to repudiate an 1 sponge their just debts
and ubhsations, and to defraud tneir honest creditors of their
juotdues anudemind , evt^n at the expense of the Constitution,
should not be permitted to turn lound and íepay the favor by
the base mgiatitude of imposing on their benefactor the costs
and expenses of then own causing, in an application to the courts
for their own peculnr and especial benefit, secured to them by
a law passed expressly for their accommodation. They should
not be allewed to cast on this Government the expense of the
courts in procuring a discnarge from their debtg-j which they were
bound by every obligation of honesty, morality, honor and con-
tract to discharge with present means or future earnings, if
within their power, to the u termost farthing Not a dollar
si ould be appropriated foi sucha purpose
The gentleman from Kentucky {Mr Pope] inquired what
harm could there be m appiopnatirg even more for the civil
expenses of the Government under this bead than the actually
necessary exptnses would require2 Would not, he asked, the
surplus remain in the Treasury as an unexpended balance?
Mi G answered, no The expedience of this Government
proved that it wouldnot                                                                 **
As a general rule of financial and economical policy, the ap-
propriations lor the ciul expenses of the Government should
not exceed the necessary expenditures Perhaps theie ¡should
be no exception to that rule in any department
or branch of the public service m time of peace
In time of war, and in oui foreign diplomatic
íelations, sometimes it might be proper and necessary to ap*
propnatemthedark beyond the seeming necessary expense ,
to meet apprehended contingencies But that necessity could
could seldom if evei ar se in the civil dapartment of the home
service of the Government, and should never he admitted to
have arisen, unl^sma most palpable case and suchas was
not then "befoie them Nevtr m time of peace, can such a necea
sny existm our domcbtic civil relation^ andm the judicial de
paitment never in time of w tr, as that wab a branch of this
Government whose expendí urea were veiy little, if any, af-
fected tither way, in the long íun, by war On the
whole he w is in favor of the amendment, a¡s it will tend
to correct the«e abuses di d1 etause the boleaigument in favor
