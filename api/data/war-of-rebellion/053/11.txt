HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF TENNESSEE, October 1, 1863.

General W. S. ROSECRANS,Commanding U. S. Forces, Chattanooga:

GENERAL: I have your communications of the 29th ultimo and 1st instant in relation to the prisoners to be restored to me in return for those sent you.

The number is so very small that I must earnestly call your attention to the disparity. Large numbers of our prisoners it seems have been sent to your rear. I have the right to expect, and must insist, that you recall a sufficient number to reciprocate the discharges already made, and to meet any further delivery on our part.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.
