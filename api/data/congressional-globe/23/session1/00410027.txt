THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

sionally the purchase of charts, chronometers,
compasses, and nautical instruments generally,
were devolved on two intelligent officers stationed
at this place The system has worked favorably,
and the small increase of expense attending it has
been amply repaid in the better preservation and
quality of those articles, and in the probable m-
ciease of safety to our vessels afloat, and to the
lives of their gallant officers and crews A spe-
cific estimate for the purchase and maintenance of
a lithographic press is submitted as a means of
saving, under charge of these omcers, still more to
the public in the procurement of charts, circulars,
and blank forms, of such kinds as are employed
not only in this office, but at the several yards,
and on board vessels in commission (A ) Its
various conveniences and usefulness*in other re-
spects, and especially in the drawings and plans
connected with the survey of our coast now in
progress, are more particularly detailed in the re-
ports annexed (B, 1 and 2 ) To prevent any
nominal or real increase of appropriations in con-
sequence of the purchase of this press, it will be
seen jn the general estimates that a corresponding,
or, indeed, a larger reduction has been made in
what is asked for the general contingent appropri-
ations for this office and for the service, and out of
which appropriations most of the above articles
are now provided
It was formerly íecommended to organize at this
place a naval medical bureau, and a bill is now
on the files of Congress reported for that purpose
As that bill was not finally disposed of, I did not
deem it proper to adopt any different system for
attaining m a different mannei most of the bene-
fits expected to be accomplished by that measure
But if nothing be done during the ensuing session
of Congress regulating this subject, it is intended,
under our present laws, that one of the older sur-
geons, in connection with other services, either at
the barracks or navy-yard in this city, shall be
detailed and employed m performing many of the
duties contemplated for a surgeon general
The whole expenses the past year, for all per-
sons situated here, and belonging to the adminis-
tration of this Department, as well as the expenses
for the care and repair of our furniture, buildings,
and the grounds aDpurtenant, were about $48,000
This amount, I trust, will be thought to bear a
favorable comparison with the same class of ex
penses at former periods, or in similar establish-
ments, when thelarge increase and extent of duties
at this place are duly considered
Passing from the central administration of this
Department to that of the persons connected with
its operations elsewhere, I would next submit to
youi consideration a few íemarks on the situation
of such of those persons as fill official stations but
are not technically denominated naval officers
They are a large and useful class, belonging to
what may be considered our civil list, and consist
of agents, storekeepers, constrjctors, builders,
schoolmasters, secretaries to commanders, clerks
of yards, engineers, live oak superintendents, and
some others attached to stations and hospitals
In an establishment growing, like the navy, in
a few years from so small a beginning to its com-
paratively gieat size at the close of the late war,
and at the present moment, it was perhaps, un-
avoidable that miny measures and appointments,
considered as incidental toother important objects
expressly authorized, should be left to the discre-
tion of the Department In this way most of the
above persons have been employed and piid, usu-
ally by virtue of esti nates and general appropria
tions, without any specific provision in any act of
Congiess regulating the manner of then appoint-
ment, or the amount of their compensation In-
deed, a system «¡mular in some respects has been
extended to other*, as the only limit which now
exists to the number of every class of naval offi-
ceis is the same discretion, restrained solely by
estimates and appropnations, and by the confirm-
ation requued from the Senate in the case of
commissioned officeis These practices have not,
in my opinion, been the safest, though the custom
of thi' Department to submit to Congress, through
the Executive and othe-wise, full communications
of its doings, m relation to most of these subject*
enables the Government to exercise any control
deemed necessaiy ovei any supposed abuse My
own  desue has been, whenever convenient and
practicable, to impose still further limits on that
discretion With this vies on a former occasion
the estimates for the contingent appropriations
were made by me more specific, and settled rules
of allowances and compensation m most cases
were established or collected, and then digested
and published The revision of our whole naval
regulations by the board heretofore appointed for
that purpose will, when finished and adopted,
probably introduce greater "system and certainty
in relation to some of these matters. But it still
deserves consideration, whether additional legal
provision might not judiciously be made concern-
ing the appointment and wages of some of the
classes before named All the persons on the civil
list now under consideration are believed to have
conducted, during the past year, with fidelity to
their duties The only essential changes in rela-
tion to them have been the following There has
been a discontinuance of tw o naval constructors,
whose services were no longer needed, and new
and more economical arrangements have been
made as to the duties of some of oui agents and
storekeepers abroad The few live-oak agents ap-
pointed for certain districts who remained in office
last December, have been dispensed with, and
no salary is now paying on that account, except
to one person m temporary employ for a few
months, in the examination of an unfinished dis-
trict In some cases in which we have had war-
rant officers competent to perform the labors as-
signed to persons belonging to civil life, and hired
at some of the yards, it has been deemed sound
economy to order the former upon such duty, and
to discontinue the services of the latter
It has not been found necessary to select a per-
manent engineer, as the superintendents of the
di y docks ar d of the erection of the hospitals have
been able for the present to perform such duties as
would have been required of him But the ad-
ditional schoolmasters authorized at the last ses-
sion have been employed, and, it is hoped, with
increased benefit to the clas3 of the younger offi
cers A general order has recently been issued
with a view to improve the education of these offi-
cers by requiring all midshipmen, whether passed
or not, after suitable relaxation under leave of
absence, to attend on one of the naval schools for
further instruction in the studies and proficiency
in the duties belonging to their profession It is
intended to employ them not only in appropriate
reading, nautical observations, and recitations, but
in forming a more practical acquaintance with the
several materials used in the construction and
equipment of vessels, and with the manner of pre-
serving them, and of applying them in building
and repairs A due portion of their leisure will
also be devoted to the performance of such services
connected with our most important naval stations
where the schools are established as will be useful
to the public, and at the same time advance them
in a moiethorough knowledge of theactive duties
which may soon devolve on them in higher and
more responsible stations
Excepting these variations, the civil establish
ments at the yards and abroad have not been ma
tenally altered during the year    It will be seen
that the whole expenses of the persons connected
with them have been considerably reduced, and
are now annually about $130,000    This does not
include the wages of oidmary laborers, as these
are more properly chaiged according to their em
ployment under other heads, which will hereafter
be considered—such, for example, as repairs of
vessels, improvements at yaids, or building of
hospitals
The only mateual change proposed in the civil
list for the ensuing year is a small addition to the
very low compensation of some of the cleiks at a
few of the yards
The remaining persons belonging to the naval
establishment aie the vanous officers and seamen
of the Navy The geneial conduct of these the
past ye-jr ¡has been highly commendable The
very small number of couits martial it is believed
has arisen from an ¡mprovingspintof haimony in
the service, and from a mild but firm and uniform
syttem of discipline Seldom has the health en-
joyed on every station been better, and the supe-
rior condition of the medical coips, as well as of
the hospitals, exercises on this subject a very
salutary influence
The number of officers in the different classes
has generally been kept within the estimates It
is proposed to continue the number much as it
now exists There are now quite as many cap-
tairs and surgeons as can be usefully employed,
the former having been increased about one third
and the latter one ft urth during the last ten years.
There are somewhat more lieutenants and mid-
shipmen than might be deemed indispensable, the
former within that time having been increased
about one half and the latter one fourth, though, in
making this comparison it is proper to state, that
previous to 1824 all these classes had occasionally
been more numerous than they were at 'hat period
But in relation to the two classes no reduction from
the estimates of Jast year is contemplated It is
considered- that on a peace establishment they
ought to possess ample and valuable materials for
any sudden or large increase of the higher classes
which any rational emergency may at any time
require, whilst nothing is found to prove more
injudicious to older officers than to be placed in a
condition where no further incentives to improve-
ment by anticipated piomotion exist, and where
the classes they already fill contain so large a
number as to permit many years to elapse without
the possibility of putting them all on active duty,
unless at the expense, inconvenience, and injury
of more frequent changes of the superior offieets
in stations and squadrons than the public interests
appear to justify
The whole number of naval officers at this time,
including those under warrants as well as commis-
sions, is about one thousand, and our whole an-
nual expenses, of every kind, for their mainte-
nance is about $850,000, or on an average about
eight hundred and fifty dollars for each officer
These expenses have not been increased during
the last ten years, except what has been caused
by the addition before mentioned to the numbers
of some classes of officers, and the augmentation
in pay in 1827 to passed midshipmen, in 1828 to
surgeons and their assistants, and in 18}0 to lieu-
tenants In the mean time, of late years, more
useless officers have been placed on half pay, and
some large allowances reduced But no further
essential reduction in these particulars can, in my
opinion, be effected without injury either to indi-
vidual officers or to the naval service Whatever
has been accomplished by myself on this subject,
and on the requirement of a more equal portion of*
laborious duty from all officers of similar rank
and date who were not invalids, has often caused
me much pain, but it has been prompted by a
strong sense of the equal justice due to the officers
themselves, and of the manifest propriety in this
Department of seeing that all those under its admin-
istration perform services for the public, when
practicable, in some degree proportionate to the
compensation they receive
It is hoped that I may not be deemed importu-
nate if I once more urge on your attention a
topic far more grateful to my feelings I have
long entertained a decided opinion that the com-
pensation to some classes of officers ought to be
increased It is certain that more equal justice
would be awarded to all, that services at sea could
more easily be obtained, that greater cheerfulness
and alacrity in the performance of duty would be
evinced, and a higher grade of qualifications in
some subordinate stations could be commanded,
if the whole subject of pay was revised, and the
compensation giaduated in a fairer propoition
among different ranks in the Navy, and to similar
ranks in ti e Army, ai d if there was provision
made for a larger and marked discrimination
between duty afloat and leave of absence, or
waiting orders,, on shore Such a discrimination
formed a prominent feature in the act of Congress
passed April 21st, 1806, and which regulates pay
as now established But that discrimination,
amounting to one half of the whole pay, was
virtually abolished by a lule of this Department in
1819 Dunng the continuance of the small com-
pensation to some classes of officers, and after so
long a piactice under that rule, with the yearly
sanction of Congress by means of the estimates
and corresponding appropr ations m confoimity to
the rule, I have not felt at liberty to alter it Fur
ther details on this subject at this time are not
deemed necessary, as they have fully and recently
been la d before you in a special report from this
