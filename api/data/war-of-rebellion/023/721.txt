Major General JOHN P. McCOWN,

Commanding, &amp;c., Chattanooga, Tenn.:

GENERAL: Upon arriving at Chattanooga the major-general commanding directs me to say you will immediately assume command of the post and the troops in that military district. Brigadier-General Heth will communicate to you all orders issued form these headquarters and whatever information you may desire relative to the troops, their disposition, &c.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 4, 1862.

Brigadier General HENRY HETH, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Colonel Scott states that 2 men, just from Nashville, report that troops were passing through that city to Kentucky. Have those men found, if possible, and learn the facts, reporting them here. If re-enforcements be going north Richmond should be advised of it. One thousand six hundred Enfield rifles ordered to-day from Atlanta to Chattanooga.

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 5, 1862.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say to you that he observes that Major Harper's command has been taken away form Maynardville by Colonel Allston and sent to Kingston. This leaves the country form Maynardville to Kingston without any cavalry force of which he is aware, except one company at Clinton. Captain Owen's company, constituting the escort of the commanding general, and having been sent to Maynardville only for the emergency, must soon be withdrawn form that point. Major Harper's command was taken by him from Chattanooga and sent to Maynardville expressly for duty at tht point, in view of its great importance and the necessity of having a cavalry force there. In case of his removal it will be absolutely necessary, in the opinion of the general, to supply his place by a force from Colonel Allston's command, and also to station a detachment of cavalry at Loy's Cross-Roads, at the junction of Powell's and Clinch Rivers, where there seems to be none. I am further directed by him to say that it has been reported to him that an infantry force of the enemy had crossed into Clinch Valley, threatening the bridge at Loudon, but, finding the force in that vicinity too strong for them, had recrossed above Kingston. He has directed Colonel Morrison to keep a sharp lookout for them with his cavalry force.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
