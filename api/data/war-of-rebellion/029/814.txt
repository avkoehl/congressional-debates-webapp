Mr.[W. R.] Chambliss, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain [H. P.] Wallace, and Lieutenant [J. C.] Wheeler assisted me on Friday on my staff.

To Major [F.] Claybrooke, who volunteered on my staff on Friday, I am greatly indebted for his services.

I recommend for promotion Sergeant Battle for conspicuous gallantry. After four color-bearers of the Twentieth Tennessee had been shot down and the regiment was in confusion, he seized the colors and bravely rallied the men under my eye.

I remain, colonel, with great respect, your obedient servant,

W. PRESTON,

Brigadier-General.

Col. T. O'HARA,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAMP NEAR TULLAHOMA, TENN., January 12, 1863.

CAPTAIN: In obedience to instructions received from brigade headquarters, I have the honor to submit the following report of the part borne by my command in the actions of December 31, 1862, and January 2, 1863, near Murfreesborough:

The command "forward" was soon given, and on advancing, our front being masked by a regiment, our left was thrown back out of line. This defect in our alignment caused the regiment to diverge to the left, and to enter a cedar forest to the left of the burnt house, the balance of the brigade passing to the right. In charging over this field we lost several men killed and wounded by the enemy's batteries, which swept the field by an almost enfilading fire. Passing through the cedar, we arrived before the enemy's batteries, and took position on the right of Stewart's brigade, where we were joined by the balance of the brigade.
