Oil we look no further into the condition of the finance^,
c \ >ugh appeaistojustify the passage of this bill, f<n it must be
remembered that the inciease of revenue under the proposed
measuiewill amount to only ©10,000000, and that, when added
to the receipts undei the compromise act, it will still leave a
large deficit Let us see the account of íeceipts and expendí
tures wh*ch will be exhibited upon the increase of revenue by
means of this bill    It will be thus1

It thus Jppean that, aftei we shall haveieceived all'hsbeae

annual deficit of $8,000,000, amounting in four yeais to $32,000

this measure as unnecessary< Have these opposes read the

But, sn, this is not the only view to be taken of the eondi
turn ofthe Treasury It came into the hands ot the present
Admmisfiation almost empty Although it had on the 1st Ja
nuary, 1S37, an une pended and available balance of $ 17,000 000
and upwards, its funds on the 4th oí March, 18*11, counte! less
than 8t>00,000 Besides ihis, the late AdmimstiaUoi received
f om the avails of the stock of the Government m the liankof
tlie United States neaily $9,000,000 It received liora its loans
upon rieasury notes $5,64^ 512 moie, and which still rem una

animadversions of the gentleman Horn Massachusetts [Mr

ration of the compromise act, the late Admimetiation received
$17,<H7 000 more than the present will receive under the reduc

less and numberless unliquidated claim? growing out of the
Florida war and the lemoval of the Indiana, many of which
are doubtless just and must be paid I baiely mention these

Sir I know of no such legislative tyianny, as is contended for

But ^ ta ¡said this bill creates a tatiff for protection, and not
for reven 1 e Ifth re be any force mthts aigument, we mu&t
aoand hi hereaftet the 1 aiding of revenue by meand of im-
ports and duties There is in fact no distinction, 111 tlus re-
spect, between a tarifF for revenue and atarifffor protection,
that universally holds All duties exacted by our Goveinment
irom foreign ai tides m the production and manutacture oí
which we are eugdged and interested, afford piotection to do
mestic industry in the pi opouion ofthe amount and extent of
these duths tooaiso Govemments, fur the mere purpose of
revenue, fiequently impose duties upon aitides of loreign
growth or manufacture, which indirectly piotectif no asim-
lai, some other branch of domestic industry The object in
creating the duties may be revenue solely, yet theresults of he
imposition be the same as if its design wab protection at home
Examples could be adduced without end We laya duty for
the purpose of revenue upon foreign wines now in piopoitioa
as this duty is prohibitory and countervailing domestic ds
tilled liquoisi, or some other home bcveiagc, will be promoted
andpioteeted A duty ¡& laid on foreign silks, or some other
foreign fabnc, andthe result is, although imposed wrhno othei
view thanfo the purpose of íevenue, and without intendmg to
añord piotectioníto any ai title of domestic induct iy, we me l'a
bly promote the use and enhance the value of a smulai or
some othei article of domestic manufactuie Ihus it will be
&een, that the argument againot this measure, md which is
built npon the position that it 1^ protective m its charactei and
operation, falls by us own weight—it pioves too much \
tauff for revenue and a taiiff for protection are most geneially
ew necessitate reit to a greater 01 ¡ess extent, one and the same
in then results.
A¿am, we are told that tne attempt to pass this bill implies
that "a readjustment of the tariff" is intended This ¡scarcely
deserve4* the name of an argument, when urged against this
measure.   But
HMen do their broken weapons rather use than theirbare hands ,J
As I count myself the fuend of a tariff, so far as is necessary to
piotect domestic industry and enterpu&e, I will not leteven this
pa°s at it, with a ' broken toil " go unnoticed While I deny
that any such inference .s to be drawn fiom the bill before u&, I
will most cheerfully concede to the South the benefit of the ar-
gument It is true that the readjustment of the tariff i¡> intend-
ed 01 at all events- its recons deration, at soire early day The
necessities of theTreasuiy, as well as pioteelion for the pro
duciions, manufacture", commerce, and navigation ofthe na
tion demand this An empty Treat, jry and an impovetishcd
country call foi early legislation on this subject ¡Mr, Í will use
no disguise I will not, for one, even to teeme the pis^age of
this bill, compromise the matter I cannot I dare not, compro
mise the mtetests of my cm^tituents and my country I say
therefore, to the South, that if bill does notimpiy, e\eiy consi-
deraron of national in eiest and duty requires, a readjustment
of the tariff And it will be oui duty, at an early day, to open
the whole subiect, and to deliberate upon it wisely dispas
sionately, and like statesmen In anticipation of the con-
flict which is then to take place, I bespeak, foi thn
important subject, views wh ell will embiare the com
piebensiveand permanent mteie^ts ofthe countiy, and not the
selfKh and separate interests of particular portions of the Union
It is to be hoped, that on that o ca-ion we shall banish a i j oui
political hopes and fears, and stand on the grander and higher
considerations of national duty, nation ti ínteiPct and national
patnotiism, that the North and the South, the Ea&t and the
West, will cast, the one their selfish, narrow policy and the
othei their constitutional enigmas, state rights, and the whole
bun lie of abstractions, to the moles and the bats
Sir, this woik ofthe revision ofthe tariff will requ re all the
wisdom and intelligence of Congress It is not to be accom-
plished ma lew days of hasty legislation It demands labói
Ion? and intense labor It requires maps and charts, treaties'
and navigation laws To undeistand and unravel the complica'
tionsofthis subject, we must be furnished wi'h statistical table*
embracing a gieat vauety oi information We must Jearn the
numbti of our ships, and ojr tonnage—the amount and value
of the surplus pioducts of our fishenes mines, manufacture*
an 1 aguculture We have not only to relieve "ur industry and
protect it, but to lo< k a.* the testnuions which obstruct oui
intercourse with foreign nation" We must examine the
levenue Jaws of other countries, to sse ii we can venture to
call oui duties counsel vailing, and, indeed, m many instances
learn the trueimpoit ofthe term We must ascertain wbethei*
ornotwe want discriminating duties on oui navigation with
othei nations, which we have so generally abolished diid
wheheror not we ^h mid continue t > nationalize the ships of
