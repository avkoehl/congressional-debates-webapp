scales, &amp;c. About ten days' would seem, therefore, to be the full capacity of supply. The same number of days' rations can be carried by the artillery supply train, but not more than five days' forage can be carried in wagons.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The recent success of Brigadier-General Averell at Lewisburg has cleared the new State of West Virginia of any organized force of rebels, and my operations for a time will probably be directed against the enemy in the Valleys of South Branch and Shenandoah. In view of this, and of the fact that the greater portion of the troops of my department are east of or in this vicinity, I have deemed it proper and advisable to change my headquarters from Clarksburg to this place.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 20, 1863-12 noon. (Received 1. 10 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

All information tends to the conclusion that Lee has not made any movement with any part of his force, but is awaiting an advance on my part. His army seems to be holding in force the fords of the Rapidan, the left of the infantry at Germanna Ford, and the right toward Orange Court-House, with his cavalry on each flank. Day before yesterday he crossed a considerable body of cavalry at Ely's Ford, who drove in our pickets, surprised an outpost, and after capturing some 30 men, a wagon and ambulance, recrossed the river at Ely's and Germanna. The object of this expedition was, undoubtedly, to ascertain whether I was making any movement to his left.
