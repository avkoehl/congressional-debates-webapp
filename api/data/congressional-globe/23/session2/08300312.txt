THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

be respecied, what may we expect> Cleaily that
those who have been compelled to pay will say,
you bullied us out of it, but when it came to the
point with the Ficnch, you gave it up, therefore,
to be equal, you must pay us Lack with interest,
if you do not, we will go on the high seas—we
will shoot your ducks, we will burn your barns,
and do worse with you than the Fieich would
have done He said he would repeat the question,
shall we give up the money, or insist on the pay-
ment of it' This is no uncommon case, atter
dealing of twenty years' standing, u pon settlement
and bond taken, if any thing is said about suit for
the money, that the statute of limitation, usury,
and gambling, extortion, or some other plea oi
bill ot injunction is threatened But the creditor
has only to decide whether he will give up the
debt or not A man talks and shuffles with you for
twenty five years, and at last gives his bond-
waits four or five years,and wnen you call on him
for the money, proposes to settle again—draws
some nice distinction, admitting the obligation of
treaties and bonds, and the authorities of agents
to make settlements, but denying the obligation
to pay the money Sir, is not this trifling with a
man' Sir, (said Mr B ,) no more negotiation
about this debt I had rather give it up—the debt
—than negotiate again Sir, when that same
France was ground into the dust (justly 01 un
justly) for peace sake—for love'ssake—forgrati
tude—for past kindness, if not fnendship—we
forebore, and said to her, " We will rot bi ess you
now, others we will compel to pay, (we said by
our actions,) but you, we will not urge just now,
we will settle with you in your own lime " And
she had settled in her own time—taken her own
time of payment Much was said in those debates
in the Fiench Chamber of Deputies about fnerd
ship and gratitude, &c They seem to think that
the fable of the husbandman and viper would
apply to us He had found a viper frozen, and
took him to his bosom, and warmed him into
life, the ungratetul viper then bit his benefactor
They spoke of us as foundlings—as some child
that has been cast away by its mothei—or, being
lost, they had found it1 Sir, they sit in then
Chamber, and we sit here I wish to have no
words of abuse with them I, like my colleague,
[Mr Archer,] do not like to hear abuse, or to g ve
it I wish you distinctly, Mr Chanman, to un
deistand that I do not deal in abuse towards any
individual, or any nation I want to heir no
abuse, and I have heard full as much pra se ot
foieign nations as I want to heai As much has
been said about love, and affection, and gratitude,
arnd obligations, too, between us a id the Fie >ch,
as there is any truth in I want to beat no moie
about love, and friendship, and gratituJe All i
want to hear, and, I am peisuaded, all ti e natío i
wishes to hear at this time, is, whether we mean
to hold on upon the trea y, or give it upe Hirely
If, then, we give it up, all is done If we do not
give it up, what follows ' I do not know T hat
is the point befoie us It is not what the Fiench
wish to know, or have the right to requn e us to
tell them With the greatest possible respect f >r
the feelings and opinions of others, I think it is
pusillanimous to be always settling, settling, and
resettling
I do not think >t would be dishonorable to g ve
up the debt 1 never heard that it was humilla
ting to give up a debt The creditor has the right,
and no one has the i ight to conif lam but the debt
or, and f nevei heard of his taking exceptions
But it is childish to be always settling and unset
tlmg and threatening I would rathei give up the
whole, if it be as the gentleman supposes, ten
tunes as much, than be always disputing and
quarreling about it Perhaps the most dignified
position we could assume would be to give it up,
and pay the private claims to that amount It is
certainly the cheapest If the nation is wi ling I
should be willing, 1 believe my constituents would
be I believe they know the wisdom and neees
Bity of attending ,o then interest as well as their
honor But I believe they would be willing if all
■were willing, togiveup the claim rather than break
the peace between the two countries Perhaps if
we were to return them their bond, and say we
have been settling for twenty five years, and you
now refuse to pay after settling even one tenth of
what vou really owed us, we will hereafter have
just as much to do with vou as suits our inclina-
tions, and no more than we can well avoid—tins
might be thought the most independent course by
allthewoild 1 know but one olj°ction to this The
claim did not originate m contioct, but m violence,
and for peace, love, grant ide, and friendship, we
I have agreed to tane money as a satisfaction 1
have no idea tha' such will be the course, and do
not mean to advise it, nor do I much feai that war
will be the consequence of insisting on a compli
anee with the treaty I think the only matenal
question we have to lespond to, is the question
before stated Will we give up the money oi not'
I think any of the resolutions answer sufilc ently
except-those of my colleague, [Mi Atchcr,] who
seems to think we could make «omethi'g by a
new settlement 1 cannot agif-e to that If they
will not comply with tins settlement they would
not eeitamlv if we brought them more m debt
I like ratner the resdulions of the lugHy es
teemed  and  veiy d stirgMsheJ gentleman fiom |
Massachusetts, [Mr  Advms ]    I have no obi°c   ,
tion even to his second resolution—to give the
President discretion   to   negotiate   fur hei    with
France, if he should think 'he honoruf the na ion
would not be many mannei compiomucd oi sac
rificed      If we tl > not think   the Piesident  has
acted wi h entire pr jdence, (and I am not unvvill   i
ing to ad nit that 1 think he has not,) a^d if some '
of us do not love i un as well as we nvgnt, and
have not all the confidence that o hers have, still i
he is the only oigin thiough which we can con
stuutioi ally  treat with  a y nation  in (etce oi '
wai      It seems admitted by all, unless it mieht I e i
thechairman of ihe Committee on Fo eign Allans,
that we ought t> have some means in peace  to
preset ve peice, and   n war to make t eace     Tins
second res ilution, theiefoie   seems distinctly to
say to <fll the woilJ, that however we may differ
in decree of personal regard for, or confidence in,
the President, su 1  he is our  P esiuent, and  we |
mean to sus'ain our own honor and our own in   ¡
stimtiois, thiough him, the only constitutional
oigan for that puipose    L°t Fiai ce see she has no
giourd to hope to p ofit by our party divisions
In saying this, and egreeing to tins resolution,
I cannot feel what my cdleague [Mr Archfr]
says we must fee—touching y elding, bendinc:
the knee, to the Pie idem—oi to the Fiench
Chambeis, whiv-i seems to me to be moie piaj
sil le Simply to say, we will expect the money
to be paid, and that we w II take our own tin e ano
means to obtain it, seems to me to be neither
yie'ding, noi su mum g, noi cinuring, to Fiance,
or the Piesiltit, or any loJy in the wold
Whether the advice given by tn° President will
be taken is 'or aftei cms deidlie n We have no

ment of the lebate he had, to avoid discussion,
stated, that if we wei e to remain at peace with
France, he thought the less we said upon the sub
ject the better He sincerely hoped and expected
that the lelations between the two countr es would
not be dis'urbed, but gentlemen haddiscu sed the
question as if we v e-e now on the eve of war
Before he sat down, he should p-opose sume
modifications of the resolutions which he hoped
would meet the concuirence of the House on all
sides He would cheerfully submit them without
fdither debate, but for the extraordinary argu
ments cf the gentleman from Vngmia, [Mr
Arcier,] who had addressed the House atlength,
and which rendered a reply indispensably neces-
sary
Before he pioceeded to reply to the gentleman
from Vuginia, he would explain as to the re«o'u
Hon proposed by the committee     That part of*it
re'ating to negotiation, he had not proposed__on
the other hai d, he had 1 nnself doubts of the pro-
priety of interfenng witn tl e duties of the Exec-
utive But there weie members who would not
vote for the resolution without thi.t portion i elating
to further negotiation, and as the minority of the
comm ttee would not vote wnh him for a modifi.
cat on, he was compelled to report that or none
He I oped,however, that m the House we should
have bettei  success
The gentleman from Vrgmia, [Mr Archfr,]
and he believed the gentleman from South Caro
lina, [Mr Pictc\s,] hail both alluded to the ri¿ht
of tl e Chambti to refuse the appropriation It
had been stated that Mr R ves was perfectly
awaie, when making the treaty, that the quest on
must be submitted to tne Chamber, and that,
therefore, it could not be complete t 11 it had rt
cived i s sanction
On this point, very great injustice had been
done that distinguished gentleman, [Mr Ruts,]
n iv only 1 ere but elsevv here In a document laid
upon oui tab'e —a document to which he was not
pei muted otherwise to lefer—he meant the Report
of the Comrji tee on Foreign Relations of the Sen-
ate—ma ifest i j istice haa been done to our late
Minis er to Fiance In tlat íepoit, it isstatel
that Mi Pt ves was aware that the treaty must be
suomitted to the Cmibei, and to sustain that
position, the ieport quotes fiom Mr R 'b letter to
the Secretary ol State, detailirg a conversation wi h
the French Mimstei, th-tt portion of it relating to
what tne letter said upon tnis subject But by an
extiaoidimry oversight, the committee had sup-
pressed tne next paragraph in the same lettei—a
suppression wl ich had been most successtully est
pesed by an opposition editor
In that suppressed paragraph, Mr R ves says
ti the Secretary of S ate, tnat in reply to the
Fiench Minister, he repelled the idea that the
Chamber had anything to do wi*h the treat} -
making powei, that that powei, by the Fiench
Constitution, was in the King exclusively, ai d
that the French Minister assented to the propriety
of his sugges ions It is (said Mr C ) extraor-
dinary, su, that so pregnant n paiagiaon should
have escaped the attention cf the committee of lh"-
Senate, following as it did the passage quoted in
their ieport Mi Hives r-everdisputed 'he power
of the CI amber to írject an apprnpi lation, but the
right of the Chamber is anothei question If it be
a ngl t, sir, it is one never to be exercised but in
the case of a gross and palnal le usuipation oi the
pait of the King It is one nevei to be ex i^ sed
on a paltry question of a few millions of fianrs,
but only in great emergencies, involving the qui s
tion of pejee or wir If it oe in any sense 11 ght
I tr ist it is one which will never be enf ret,J in
ib s House for it is at oest but a light to violate
the publ c faitl . and to aDrogate the solemn obh
gations of a treaty , a light to disgrace your coun-

pected such a declaration from a gentleman of his
intell «enre [Mr A dm not mean to be so un-
derstood ] What, sn,waa our war, which we
made, though _not declared, aga nst France in
1798—was it not f ir her depi edations on oui coró-

1812, but for her captures urder her orders in
council' Jf we make war for spohations on oui
commerce, are we not authonzed to do so, when,
af'e>-five and twenty years negotiation, a treaty
founded upon such wrongs, is viola el —wrongs,
too, which would have conpelled us to meet the
decrees of France with a declaration of war, had
we not been, in 1812, forced to decide whether
we should declare war against France or England,
for both had violated our national rights, and the
law of nations Fiance had not orly violated
piblic law, but the obligations of the treaty of
1800
