thickening we were compelled to cease firing. About one and a half hours afterward I found the enemy endeavoring to escape under cover of the fog, and again opened fire, but the range being too great, after firing a few 10-inch shots, ceased entirely. The enemy fired only a fees shots at us, all of which were harmless.

About 8 a. m. the Yankee fleet occupied nearly their original ground, the Ironsides firing an occasional shot at Battery Wagner.

The details of the engagement will be furnished in the official report of the action.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS FORT MOULTRIE, S. C.,August 27, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that about 1 a. m. the sentinels at this post reported the approach of the Yankee monitors. The alarm was given and batteries promptly manned. After firing a few shots (the enemy being scarcely visible), the vessels promptly retired beyond range. Nothing further to report.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT DE TREVILLE,

FORT MOULTRIE, S. C.,

September 1, 1863.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that yesterday morning, between 11 and 12 o'clock, one of the enemy's iron-clads approached this fort, and when within range I opened fire on her. The enemy replied at long range, principally with shrapnel, all of which fell short. After about an hour's engagement, the monitor withdrew.

A little before 2 o'clock, the enemy again approached, this time with four monitors, and found us ready to receive them. We opened on them, and kept up a steady fire, firing in all 132 shots, to which the enemy replied with 15-inch and rifled shells, firing in all, as near as can be estimated, about sixty times. The fort was struck six times by 15-inch shells, and in several places by fragments, but received on injury. Many of their shells fell short, and a number burst on each side and among the neighboring buildings. Not the slightest injury of any kind happened to either officers or men.

Particulars of the engagement will be furnished in an official report.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBERT DE TREVILLE,

Major, Commanding.

Captain W. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
