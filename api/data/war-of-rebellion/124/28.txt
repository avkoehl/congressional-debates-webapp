On the 25th of October I returned from La Libertad, having left the boat near the well in a gully near the beach, partially filled with sand, and arrived at Pitiquito on the 27th of October.

On the 28th I went to Cahorca to make inquires in regard to the port of Lobos and to get a guide.

On the 29th, having left all my escort except five men, I took one wagon and started en route for Lobos. The president de la municipalidad of Cahorca and Don Jesus Rivera, of that place, accompanied me. Don Anonio Ramirez voluntarily offered his services as guide gratis. To these three gentlemen I am under many obligations for courtesy, kindness, and many favors. Ramirez is one of the best of guides, and to him belongs the honor of first guiding wagons over a practicable route to both La Libertad and Lobos. He it was who guided Don Miguel Zepeda, who opened the Libertad road. I inclose an itinerary* of the route from Cahorca to Lobos, and transmit also a sketch* of the port of Los Lobos. It not being practicable to carry the boat here, no sounding were taken, and as no fresh water is found at Lobos our stay was limited to a few hours, having arrived there on the morning of the 1st of November at 9 o"clock and left on our return at 3 p. m. same day. The sketch herewith gives as nearly correct an outline of Lobos as could well be done without an actual survey. The harbor appears to have deeper water than Libertad, except at the cove at the north end the low spit of land. The southern point is formed by a high mountain ridge called the Sierra del Toloache; the northern by a low spit of land which, though not so good as the southern, still shelters the bay from heavy seas, if not from high winds. The topography of Lobos is not so favorable for a town or settlement as La Libertad, the ground being more desert, more rough, and broken up by ridges and gullies. The shore in the central and southern parts is a high bluff composed of limestone, shell, and sand. Elevation from 75 to 150here the jackals are marked on the map, however, the position is favorable for building houses and for landing goods. From the elevated shores I could discover that the water is deep, and near the beach the bottom the same as at La Libertad. The water is deeper near the shore, except at the ship end, where the low tide leaves several hundred yards bare and some rocks exposed. Except at this part of the bay appears to be no rocks or shallows. I consider the harbor or roadstead rather safe and commodious, and would recommend that the first time a public vessel comes to Libertad that sounding be taken at Lobos. Water in abundance for shipping can be had at the desemboque (mouth) of the Altar River at a distance by sea not exceeding twelve to fifteen miles, which is at the foot of La Sierra de las Espinas, north 6 degrees west. No agricultural lands are nearer Lobos than the Bajio Leon, twelve miles and a third distant. The northern point of La Libertad Bay is seen from Lobos, viz, Cabo de Lobos about twenty miles nearly south (south 18 degrees east.) The port is like La Libertad, surrounded by a semicircular range of succession of sierras situated as follows: Sierra de la Cascarita, on the gulf north 4 degrees west; Sierra de las Espinas, at foot of which is the desemboque and fresh water, say fifteen miles, north 5 degrees west; La Sierra del Tanque, north 11 degrees west; Cerro Pinto, a whitish detached hill, north 15 degrees west; Cerro del Copal, north 5 degrees west. The Sierra del Puerto de Lobos extends from north to east, the greatest
