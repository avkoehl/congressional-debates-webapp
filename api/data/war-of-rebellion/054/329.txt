BLAIN'S CROSS-ROADS, December 16, 1863.

(Received 8 p.m.)

GENERAL: I transmit a report, just made by Captain Daniels, signal officer, of his observations yesterday. There was no infantry reported as engaged to-day with our rear guard. General Granger has arrived, and desires me to say that the enemy withdrew their artillery this evening. I will keep you advised from time to time.

Yours,respectfully,

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

Major-General FOSTER.

BLAIN'S CROSS-ROADS, December 17, 1863.

This morning the enemy advanced in small force on General Sturgis' pickets, but nothing serious since then; but few shots have been fired, and those at long range. There is no forage for Sturgis' horses in our front, and in conferring with him we have decided to move them to right and left and occupy the river roads and the Maynardville road, to observe and report any movement on our flanks. Will you please have Captain George W. Gowan, in Captain Poe's office, ordered to report to me as an aide,if his place can be filled in the engineer office. The signal officer reports, "I cannot see any infantry, only a few scouts; a dense fog is where the flag was seen last."

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

P. S.-General Granger is here. He says he is of the same opinion still; he knows nothing more than when he left Knoxville. General Granger and I both think there is no necessity for your coming out at present.

BLAIN'S CROSS-ROADS, December 17, 1863-4 p.m.

The enemy has not made any serious demonstration on the Rutledge road up to this time; since noon they have been pressing the brigade. Spears stationed at Stone's Mill, Richland Church, about 2 miles on our right, where the river road crosses Richland Creek. They may be massing on the river road, but General Granger thinks it would be risky for them to attempt this move. Still, if this be so, we may be forced to fall back on the line of Flat Creek. General Sturgis will send a division of cavalry to occupy the line of Richland Creek. I regret that Elliott has been able to cross but one brigade. He is now at Strawberry Plains, and will get over as soon as he can. I am glad to hear you are coming up.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

Major-General FOSTER.
