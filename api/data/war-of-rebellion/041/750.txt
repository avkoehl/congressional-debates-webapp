HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,New Orleans, October 1, 1863.

Major-General FRANKLIN, Camp Bisland:

GENERAL: The within telegram* was received at 7 p. m.

You will perceive that it was dated yesterday. I have answered that General Washburn reported himself to-day ready to move, and has been ordered to advance within half a day's march of the Nineteenth [Corps], and hold that distance, following Franklin's marches, unless otherwise ordered by Franklin, who, if he needs or wishes him nearer, can order it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[CHAS. P. STONE,]

Brigadier-General, and Chief of Staff.
