We have taken steps to make the best defense possible in case of a raid. Please let me hear from you, general, at your earliest convenience, especially in relation to my assumption of authority. I shall feel anxious until I hear from you in relation to this matter.

I am, general, very truly, your obedient servant,

W. G. LEWIS,

Colonel Fifty-seventh Regiment Enrolled Missouri Militia.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, Mo., July 21, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS:

General Fisk is making every effort to get arms, but with the present prospects I fear I cannot get them from here in time to do any good. I am in expectation that the Hannibal and Saint Joseph Railroad will be cut very soon, if not already done. Cannot you send him at once 2,000 or 3,000 stand of arms with full supply of proper ammunition? Time is everything now.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF KANSAS,In the Field, Lawrence, July 21, 1864.

General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

I have telegraphed General Fisk that I will share arms and ammunition to loyal troops raised near Leavenworth, but I have only arms to put in hands of Kansas troops now mustering. I am authorized to arm Kansas militia, which I will do as long as a gun remains, if necessary, and you shall have the guns in loyal hands to help you.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 21, 1864.

Lieutenant G. T. ROBINSON,

Chief Engineer, Paola, Kans.:

Come back by Wyandotte and lay out fortifications there for citizens. See E. S. Hubbard, at that place.

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 21, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS,

Lawrence, Kans.:

General Fisk telegraphs as follows:

Can you possibly in any way let me have 1,000 stand of arms, and ammunition therefor? The defection in the militia increases every hour. Thornton will soon have a formidable army. Give me all the help you can.

Colonel Ford also telegraphs to know where he can get arms for 500 loyal citizens in Kansas City and vicinity for home defense.

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
