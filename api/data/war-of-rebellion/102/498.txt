Major J. W. BARNES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The band of rebels was two miles north of Lebanon this morning. The early part of the night was so dark that the troops lost the trail, but or now in pursuit, and I think will come up with the rebels to-day. The rebels killed Lieutenant Stroup, enrolling officer, and Mr. Breakfield, by cutting their throats after trying their hands behind them, and hung the sheriff of the country, Mr. Harris, and broke his skull. This was done one mile from the place where this party was captured. The probability is that Lieutenant Johnson and the five soldiers are also murdered, but I have no information from them yet.

They crossed the Wire road eight miles east of this place. Our scout has evidently come up with them before this time. I will dispatch again when I hear from them

Brigadier-General SANBORN:

SIR: The scout found where they camped. The rebels went on the west side of this, and the night was very dark, so we could not keep on their trial. I sent scouts in all directions. After they captured Lieutenant Johnson and squad [they] went one mile and murdered Lieutenant Stroup and the sheriff and Mr. Breakfield by trying their hands behind them and them cutting their throats; the sheriff they hung and them and then cutting their throats; the sheriff they hung and then knocked him on the head. They had Lieutenant Johnston at Mr. Harman's, ten miles north of this place, and in a few
