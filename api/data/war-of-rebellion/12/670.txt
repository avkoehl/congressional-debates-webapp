HEADQUARTERS CASEY'S DIVISION,May 29, 1862.

I have the honor to report that in obedience to instructions I directed General Naglee on the 25th to make a reconnaissance in front to the position I assigned to the One hundred and fourth and Fifty-second Pennsylvania Volunteers from the First Brigade; the Eighty-fifth Pennsylvania Volunteers. Second Brigade; and the Eighty-fifth and Ninety-eight New york Volunteers, Third Brigade. I directed two batteries of artillery (Regan and Spratt) to report to him. about one mile from camp he met the enemy, and succeeded in driving them for 2 miles-about one-half mile beyond the cross-road at the Seven Pines. I arrived on the ground when the reconnaissance was within about three-fourths mile of its termination, and accompanied it to the point. i saw no reason to alter the disposition which General Naglee had made.

The reconnaissance was a very successful one, and was conducted by its commander with skill and promptness. The troops behaved well. The day was rainy and disagreeable.

I directed General Naglee to remain and hold the cross-roads, and re-enforced him with five regiments of infantry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SILAS CASEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Respectfully forwarded.

Being personally present with the advance at the close of the reconnaissance, and for an hour and a half before it ended, I can testify to the good conduct of the troops and the gallantry of General Naglee.
