themselves, and with all the world outside, at
rates never exceeding ten per cent. Under
this wise policy Germany became prosperous
beyond all precedent. The stimulating influ-
ence of free exchange did not diminish, but
at once, and from year to year, greatly increased
the revenue of each State in the Zollverein,
and the production of all their great staples
of industry.
The following table well illustrates the effect
of that freedom in trade which the Zollverein
inaugurated:

It is a significant fact, that among the articles
whose production was greatly increased under
the healthful influences of the Zollverein,
iron was perhaps the most remarkable. Under
protection it was a home monopoly, as it is
now in great measure in the United States.
Under the Zollverein's free trade it became
a large item of export.
Through the policy of protection the gar-
nerings of our people find their way into the
pockets of a class ; the poor are being impov-
erished and the rich made disproportionately
richer. It is in the building up of this class
at the expense of the whole, and in the inju-
rious and artificial stimulation of prices and
of the cost of living, without anything ap-_
proaching an equivalent increase in the capa-
city for production, that protection is dealing
deadly blows at the prosperity and liberties of
our people. And the longer this corrupt and
swindling system is continued the more diffi-
cult it will become to return to rational and
honest policy, and, indeed, the time is rapidly
passing away when any recovery from this
state of affairs by the present generation will
be practicable. Under the present and pro-
posed system of tariffs every farmer who
brawns his hands with honest toil, every
mechanic who swells the industry of the
country in his shop, every common carrier
who contributes his efforts to the unwearying
commerce which from evermore has formed
the principal bond of sympathy between distant
communities, must expend an extra quantity
of the energies of his precious life with which
to enrich the insatiable coffers of coddling and
■ intriguing monopolists, and build up and support
an aristocracy of American absentees who find
cheaper living under the more rational sys-
tems of trade and commerce abroad than at
home. By perpetuating such a system as this
proposed bill will create Congress can effect-
ually impoverish and enslave the people, and
the country, and establish a universal monop-
oly ; in the language of one of the greatest
thinkers of this century—
"A monopoly which comes home to the business
and bosoms of men, follows them in their daily avoca-
tions, troubles them with iU petty, meddling-spirit,
and, what is worse than all, diminishes their respon-
sibility to themselves, thus depriving them of what
is the only real education th*t most minds receive—
the constant necessity of providing for future con-
tingencies, and tho habit of grappling with the dif-
ficulties of life.''—Buckle's History of Civilization,
vol. i, p. 453.
Mr. Speaker, there can be no republicanism,
no democracy, which has naught to live upon
but the dead and despised letter of the organic
law. It must be a Republic in spirit as well as
in letter. It must have freedom, not alone on
the written pages of its constitution, but real,
living freedom—freedom for its people to go
where they please and to do what they please,
provided they do not infringe the like priv-
ilege in others; freedom to buy what they
please and sell what they please, and where
they think best, not compulsion to buy wood-
screws at eight times their value, to pay fifty
dollars for sewing-machines which the same
manufacturers advertise for sale in Paris at
nine dollars, to pay ten dollars a ton for coal
when they can get it in Nova Scotia for three.
The wise and always sagacious Dr. Franklin
well said:
" It were to be wished that commerce wero as free
between all the nations of the world as it is between
the several counties of England."
The practical results of the present and of
the proposed tariff, as most oppressive burdens
upon the industry of all consumers, may be
best indicated by some comparative tables,
embracing representative articles of general
or universal consumption. Look at the fol-
lowing table showing the excessive duties now
exacted and those proposed in the pending bill:

Every intelligent man or woman in the coun-
try knows that there is no article known to
commerce or used among men that assumes
such an infinite variety of forms or answers
such an innumerable diversity of uses as steel
and iron. It would be very difficult to find a
single industrial pursuit in the prosecution of
which some of the products of steel or iron
were not indispensable. They enter alike into
the formation of the simplest utensil of hus-
bandry and the mightiest engine of mechanical
power. They are alike essential in the con-
struction of a watch and of a railroad with its
vast rolling stock. In one or another of their
various forms of usefulness they greet the
infant in its cradle and follow it at every atep
of its progress through life. They minister in
numberless ways to the comfort, improvement,
and civilization of mankind. But they are
more important to and more used by the poor
than the rich. They both diminish and miti-
gate the toil of the poor man awl of the me-
chanic, and enable them to rescue a part of
their time from the service of their physical
wants to the needed improvement of their
minds. Now, how are these articles taxed
ted proposed to be taxed? Remember that
any tax on them is a direct tax on every indus-
trial pursuit in the country.
It is the policy of most modern nations to
leave the products of iron and steel as free as
possible. It is the experience of all nations
that when they are left most free the product-
ive capacities and general earnings of the peo-
ple are most rapidly augmented. Their ability
to pay the necessary revenue for the support
of Government, and to develop successfully all
the material interests of the country are cor-
respondingly increased. Now, Mr. Speaker,
let us see how these principles are regarded in
the adjustment of our tariff. The duties im-
posed by existing laws on the leading descrip-
tions of iron and steel, such as pig iron, bar
iron, small, round and square iron, hoop iron,
refined iron, best Yorkshire iron, best English
boiler-plates, steel tires for locomotives, and
other descriptions average fully fifty cents per
hundred weight.
Now, to make more clear the provisions and
policy of the proposed tariff, and the extent to
which it will increase the cost of all the prod-
ucts of steel and iron, and burden every in-
dustry in the country, except the monopolies,
in whose interests all such laws are framed, I
invite attention to the following table, which
has been prepared with great care and is no
doubt entirely correct:
Table comparing the cost per ton, on board, at the port
of shipment, including sixty cents per ton shipping
charges, of iron imported into the United States, with
the duties proposed to be charged on the same in ths
bill reported by the Senate Committee on Finance, Jan-
uary 11,1867—reduced to United States gold.

It will thus appear that the rates of dutie3
under the new law would average over one
hundred per cent, on the original cost of the
iron on ship-board in the foreign port. Is it
possible that the people of this country must
pay such tribute to our domestic manufacturers
of steel and iron to enable them to live and
make reasonable profits ? Do you reply that
this enormous duty on the imported iron and
steel will be paid into the public Treasury to
reduce our taxes at home? I answer that
these excessive duties will very greatly reduce,
if they do not destroy, the importation of the
foreign product. But the home manufacturers
will increase their prices by adding the amount
of the duty thereto, and the consumers will
still have the same duty to pay, not into the
Treasury to reduce our taxes, but into the
private coffers of the manufacturers to swell
