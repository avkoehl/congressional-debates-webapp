I cannot but notice the uniform patience and endurance of the officers and men of my command during many trials and dangers incident to our march, as well as their bravery and fortitude under the several engagements with the enemy in which the regiment has participated.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. N. VORIS,

Captain, Commanding Eighty-eighth Indiana Volunteers.

Captain J. W. FORD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Numbers 71. Report of Captain Joseph Hinson, Thirty-third Ohio Infantry, of operations January 20-March 23.
HDQRS. THIRTY-THIRD OHIO VETERAN VOL., INFANTRY,Goldsborough, N. C., March 24, 1865.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the part taken by this regiment in the late campaign:

In reference to prisoners and stock captured and turned over, I have kept no account; neither of the distance traveled, as I had no accurate means at my disposal of discovering it.

In regard to losses, I have to report: On the 16th instant, 1 man killed and 3 wounded; on the 19th instant, 4 killed, 28 wounded, and 1 commissioned officer and 20 men missing; from forage parties, 8 men missing, making a total loss of 5 killed, 31 wounded, and 1 commissioned officer and 28 enlisted men missing; total, 65.

Of the officers and men under my command I must say that in action, at least, they did their duty manfully, and if any disgrace is attached to the confusion in which they retired on the 19th from the line of works from which they were driven it rests altogether with me in not assuming the responsibility and taking them from a position which I saw they could not hold but would be driven from in a very short time.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HINSON,

Captain, Commanding.

Captain J. W. FORD.
