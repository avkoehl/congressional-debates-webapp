THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 23,
" 4th. No patronage to pro-slavery merchants; no gucst-
.$bip In elave-waiting hotelsj no fees to pro-slaveiy law-
yers! ; no employment of pro-slavery physicians; no audi-
enoc lit pro-slavery parsons.
5thv No more hiring of slaves by non-slaveholders.
"6th. Abrupt discontinuance of subscription to pro-sla-
very newspapers.
Mr. Seward said:
"I have examined the Impending Crisis of the South
with deep attention. It seems to me a work of great merit,
rich yet aecuiate in statistical information and logical
analysis."
".Every sentence of the book," said Joshua It. Giddings,
" finds a response in the hearts of ali true lie publicans."
Now, how can the gentleman say that any party
at any period of the Government, before the ad-
vent of the BlacR Republican party, ever pro-
mulged such doctrines as these? Yet these are
the doctrines of his party, not alone of what he is
pleased to call the school of Abolitionists proper,
out Republicans. Mr. Seward says he has ex-
amined them with deep attention, that they arc
right, and sends them out to the world with the
solemn sanction and seal of his approval. I take
it, then, they are the doctrines of all true Republi-
cans, for all true Republicans are bound to indorse
the doctrines of their leader and chief and presi-
dential candidate, the author and finisher of their
faith. Why did not he repudiate them in his re-
cent famous speech in the Senate, to be circulated
by the million amongst his northern followers?
Although that speech was intended as a sort of
softening down from the bold and defiant tone of
his Rochester manifesto, yet, sir, not a declara-
tion that he has ever heretofore made is revoked;
not a syllable he has ever said, Helper book in-
dorsement and all, recanted; not an act that his
party has ever perpetrated, denounced. And whilst
the irrepressible conflict that isnowgoingon in his
own borders, between his free laborers and the
grasping power of their capital lords of the loom
and the workshop, under his preaching and his
policy, hasdriven him to a sort of softening-down
process, his principles, and the principles of his
party, are the same.
Mr, Chairman, when with unprejudiced and
impartial eye we survey the condition of the Re-
public—theSouth, sensitive concerning her rights,
keenly alive to her honor, her interests, and her
institutions, jealous of encroachment, looking full
in the face the dangers which betide her—is it to
be wondered at that she should resist? for it is a
defensive war in which she has boon engaged from
first to last. Let us alone, is all we ask. The
wonder is, that she has withstood so much, and
so long. The aggressions which have been made
and carried on by the North upon the South, if
they had been by a foreign foe instead of a people
of the same family and tongue and country and
kindred, would long since have brought on a
bloody and resisting war. For far less did our
fathers burst the bonds which bound them to Brit-
ain. They resisted the tyranny of taxation with-
out representation. Ours is the tyranny and op-
pression of the robbing and plundering of our
property,declared such by theConstitution. Does
theextremestlire-eater,ifyou please, demandany-
thing that is unconstitutional? Is he in favor of
a dissolution of this Union, if the Constitution
were carried out and enforced as our fathers in-
tended f I have never heard upon this floor a dis-
union declaration that was not based upon the
happening of such a contingency as would, in their
judgment, result in a despotism and destruction
of the rights of the weaker section.
Sir, with the solemn declarations of this party,
that, give them the power, and we are to have no
more slave States; that we arc not to carry our
property into Territories belonging as much to us
as to you; that slavery is to be abolished in the
District of Columbia; that you are to make the
Supreme Court subservient to your views, to de-
cide that negroes arc citizensof the United States;
that the fugitive slave law is unconstitutional; that
Congress has power to legislate upon the subject
of slavery, and, consequently, as you have so re-
corded, to abolish it in the States—with this "im-
pending crisis" upon us, is it at ali remarkable
that{> we should begin to think, atleast, aboutset-
ting our house in order?"
You are continually charging the Democratic
party with being the aggressive slave power. Let
us see how the South has been aggressive. I
have a table here showing the apportionment of
Representatives in Congress, from 18H to 1852,

Since this apportionment, Oregon and Minnesota
have sent three more free-State Representatives,
making fifty-seven m favor of the free States. In
1811 there were eighteen free-State representatives
m the Senate and sixteen from the slave States.
Now there are thirty-six from the free States and
thirty from the slave, with a fair prospect of two
more Senators and one Representative from Kan-
sas this session. Thus it will be seen how the
slave power has aggressed. Stop your aggressions,
and there will be peace.
You say we are responsible because we repealed
the Missouri compromise line. You resisted the
admission of every single, solitary slave State just
as violently whilst it was in existence as if there
had been no such line. You disregarded, violated,
trampled it under foot, and say now that its repeal
brought the country into peril. The great differ-
ence between the Democratic and Republican par-
ties is this: that instead of the repeal of an uncon-
stitutional measure, so declared by the Supreme
Court, having brought the country into peril, itis
your flagrant violation of constitutional laws, so
declared by the Supreme Court, that has done it.
Winch is the party true to the Constitution and
the Union?
It is a suicidal policy on the part of the people
of the North to seek to break clown and destroy
the system of labor at the South. Upon the prod-
ucts of slave labor are they dependent for their
daily bread. Why, sir, if the falling off of the
trade of the South, in a few short months, caused
by recent social estrangement between the two
sections, has provoked revolt amongst the labor-
ing masses in the North, what would be the re-
sult of the total failure of one cotton crop even ?
And who, I ask, can calculate the wide-spread
desolation that would follow the total abolition
of slave labor? The famine of Ireland would in-
vade your northern realms; starvation would
stalk through your whole land; misery and want
would desolate your now prosperous towns and
citics. There is, if you knew your owninterests,
a perfect harmony, instead of conflict, between the
two systems of free and slave labor. We make
the cot ton, which cannot he made without negroes,
and which the world is obliged to have. We make
the cotton, and you manufacture it. But your
policy of antagonistic interests, continually war-
ring upon us, is fast driving us into manufacturing
as well as making it.
Your policy will force southern States into the
passage of laws taxing goods of northern manu-
facture. Instead of buying our domestic prints,
boots, shoes, hats, and all such articles of prime
ncccssity from you, wo will manufacture them
ourselves. This will bring about that system of
direct trade which has been so mooted in the last
few years. And when your merchant princes and
your capital men, your manufacturers and your
laborers, and your teeming and toiling population
of every class begin properly to understand to
what want and degradation your policy is fast
driving them, they will rise in the majesty of their
might and "strike," not only as they are now
doingfor work, wages, and bread, but strike their
oppressors and false teachers from their ill-gotten
throne of power, and prostrate them forever.
Mr. Chairman, I think I have clearly estab-
lished that the Republican party is the only
party in the land traitorous to the Constitution,
and consequently disloyal to the Union. That
the founders of the Republic held no principles
such as these; that the Democratic party is not
aggressive, but defensive, upon the question of
southern rights; that the Republican party alone
is aggressive; that should this party succeed, that
success would work the inevitable overthrow of
the best Government over given to man. How is
this direful calamity to be avoided? And what
party organization alone can do it? These are
questions soon to be settled; and in my humble
judgment the fate of the Republic rests upon the
manner in which they are to be determined. It
is time for patriots everywhere,North and South,
calmly to deliberate upon these momentous inter-
ests. We have a common enemy. Let us, at
least for a season, heal up the little family quar-
rels which have crept into our camp, and with one
unbroken front again meet the enemy. We of
the South should be united. Wo arc told that a
united South would make a southern sectional, as
there is a northern sectional, party. Not so; for
we have friends—a political power at the North,
who want to sec us united amongst ourselves, and
united with them to beat back this common enemy.
I am for conquering. I am for preserving this, the
fairest fabric of human liberty. I am for uphold-
ing our institutions as they came from the hands
of our fathers. I cherish them just as they gave
them to us. Perish forever all the bright mem-
ories of the illustrious past, if they cannot be
preserved unsullied. I yield to no mortal man in
devotion to this Union. Tennessee, the proud
State of my nativity, amongst the first-born
daughters after the Revolution, loves tins Union
with all the deep devotion of an elder sister. But,
sir, with this devotion there is mingled a sacred
attachment to the Constitution. Her rights in
the Confederacy, her perfect equality, and the
perfect equality of all her people, she will guard
with a jealous care. When we survey our coun-
try—her past, present, and untold future—when
we contemplate her mighty energies, her vast re-
sources, her proud position, though yet an infant
in the age of nations, it does seem that the ener-
gies of every patriot should be aroused to the
great duty of preserving these priceless blessings.
Itis easy to destroy, but hard to reestablish. Once
destroyed,reestablished never. I warn you,then,
vou men of the North—you who boast your
feunker Hill and other battle-fields of the Revo-
lution—I warn you to beware, to stop while yet
it is time, and stay the hand that is laid upon the
ark of our covenant.
Mr. MORRILL. Mr. Chairman, it is my pur-
pose to confine my remarks, at this time, to the
subject before us, and explain, if I can, what-
ever may be new m the features of the bill, the
principles upon which it is founded, and some
arguments urging Us adoption.
When I reflect upon the difficulties whichever
recur upon propositions for the adjustment of our
revenue laws, considered, as they have been, m
times past, by men of the most eminent ability,
I confess that it would have suited me best to
have remained silent, and to have allowed other
gentlemen, far more competent than myself, to
comment upon the exigencies of the Governmr nt,
and the remedy ofFered. I speak because, from
my position, it is a duty I do not feel at liberty
to shirk.
The first object of the bill proposed is to author-
ize a loan to pay off the Treasury notes and the
accruing interest. When these notes were first
issued—December 23, 1857—they were merely
accepted for the relief of a tempoiary emergency.
It was not proposed to ingraft a Government bank
