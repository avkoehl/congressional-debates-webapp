APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Feb. 13,
29th Cong 2d Sess.
The Three Million Bill—Mr. Stewart.
Ho. ojp Reps.
and with it destroy the iast, best hope of liberty
on earth; and for what ? To gratify the lust of
power and the lust of land—the ravenous appetite
of James K. Polk, to acquire territory not his
own, and signalize his Administration by the glo-
ries of war—war! glorious war! upon a weak,
distracted, and unhappy sister republic—and what
for i She owed us a debt of some two or three
millions, which she was too poor to pay. She
acknowledged the debt, and promised to pay it as
soon as she could. Yet this is made by the Pres-
ident in his message, the great and leading cause
of war. How magnanimous; how glorious! We
took Texas—she acquiesced. Not satisfied, Mr.
Polk determines to have California'. He sends
Mr. Slidell to purchase it—they offer to treat with
him as a commissioner, but not as a minister—
which they said implied relations of amity and
friendship which did not exist. Mr. Polk would
not yield the point, or change the name from min-
ister to commissioner, which, if done, might have
prevented this war with all its horrors; but rather
than, yield this point of etiquette, he ordered Mr.
Slidell home, and immediately, and without con-
sulting Congress then in session, ordered General
Taylor to march to the Rio Grande, blockaded
that river, and brought on the war. Up to this
time what had Mexico done? Had she invaded
Texas since its annexation ? No. Had she com-
mitted any act of hostility? None—none what-
ever. None is pretended; yet we are to extermi-
nate Mexico and revel in the halls of the Monte-
zumas, and prosecute this Executive war at an
expense of millions of money, and oceans of blood.
Is it right!—before God and man, is it right >
And to enable the President to prosecute this
glorious war, he has sent us a message, which has
just been received and read by the Clerk, recom-
mending the imposition of duties on tea and coffee.
In his message at the commencement of the session
he spoke equivocally on this point; but?as the
revenue has fallen greatly short—the last quarter,
up to the first of January, having yielded only
$3,645,000; less than it has been for many years
past—he has at length come out and assumed the
responsibility of avowing himself in favor of a
tax on tea and coffee as a revenue measure. Last
session the doctrine of the Secretary, and of the
Administration, was, that the reduction of duties
increased the revenue; but now, finding a plentiful
lack of revenue, they propose to do—what? Re-
duce the duties still fuither ? Notatall. Hunger
is very apt to bring people to their senses. And
now they have at last admitted the truth of the
Whig doctrine, that the way to get an increase of
revenue is to increase the duties. This is quite
new as a Democratic doctrine. Mr. Polk did not
use to think so. At one time he was for destroy-
ing the whole system of internal improvements,
because it furnished "a sponge," to absorb the
surplus, and to keep up a high tariff.
But now he has found out another sponge; his
extravagance and war furnish a sponge large
enough to absorb all the revenue, and even as
much more. Now, when he finds the revenue
insufficient—when he discovers that the tariff is
too low—having taken the duties off luxuries, he
proposes to tax tea and coffee. That is now Demo-
cratic doctrine. The tariff of '46 takes duties off
of the luxuries of the rich, and, to make up, it is
proposed to tax the necessaries of the poor; the
tariff of '42 imposed high duties on luxuries, and
no duties at all on tea and coffee.
Mr. COBB here inquired what duties on luxu-
ries had been reduced by the tariff of 1846 ?
Mr. S. said, the list was long, he could not re-
collect them all; but since he was called on, he
would give the gentleman a few, and he would
first mention brandy, and spirits distilled from
grain. The duty on these, under the tariff of '42
was 162 per cent., which Mr. Polk, and his om-
niscient Secretary, reduced, by the tariff of '46
sixty-two per cent., Under the tariff of '42, the
revenue derived from brandy and distilled spirits
was fl,623,000 on the importations of 1845. Un-
der the taiiff of '46, the duties on the same would
be but $1,191,000; showing a loss of revenue on
brandy and distilled spirits alone of $432,000, and
tins loss is now to be made up by a duty on tea
ana coffee; and this is Democratic policy—to take
duties oft of the rich man's brandy, Irish whiskey,
and Holland gin, and put them on the poor man's
tea and coffee! If you want more money for your
war, go back and restore these duties on brandies
and foreign spirits, and other luxuries, and then
talk about taxing the necessaries of life.
Mr. COBB here inquired whether the tariff of
1846 had not raised the price of American grain ?
Mr. S. said, after the Yankee fashion, he would
answer the gentleman's question by asking.him
another; Did the tariff of '46 produce the potato
rot in Ireland ? Did it blight all the wheat crops
of Europe, and produce a superabundant crop
here ? If it did, then the gentleman's notion was
rjght, but not otherwise. He would tell the gen-
tleman, that the tariff of '46 had about as much to
do with the price of grain, as it had with the rising
and setting of the sun—no more.
Mr. S. supposed the gentleman had been study-
ing Mr. Walker's late profound tariff tables, in
which he stated that the price of grain in the Uni-
ted States had increased, from the 1st of July to
the 1st of December last, one hundred and fifteen
millions of dollars, which he attributed to the tariff
of '46, although it all took place under the tariff of
'42, that of '46 not having then commenced its op-
eration. -But, I repeat, all his boasting about the
increase of prices goes on the presumption that the
tariff of '46produced thepotato-rot in Ireland, short
crops abroad, and great crops at home.
Mr. COBB next inquired, what had raised the
price of cotton ?  
Mr. S. Was it the tariff of '46? What had it
to do with cotton? He would tell the gentleman
it was a short crop. The last crop of cotton, he
understood, had fallen short fully one-third; while
the demand was increasing, at home and abroad,
a diminished supply and an increased demand had,
as it always would, increased the price of cotton,
as of everything else.
But since the gentleman from Georgia had called,
his attention to cotton, he would remind the gen-
tleman of what the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr.
Walker, had said on this subject. He said we
must take more British goods, or, if we did not,
" she would have to pay us specie for our bread-
stuffs, and, not having it to spare, she will bring
down the price of our cotton." This is the doc-
trine of the Secretary. Now, sir, look at the facts.
In this same report Mr. Walker states, that in
1845 we took $45,600,000 worth of British goods,
while she took but $154,236 worth of our bread-
stuffs, (35,355 barrels of flour, 2,010 bushels of
wheat, and one barrel of corn meal;) yet we are
told officially that we must take more than forty-
five millions of British goods, or she will have to
pay us specie ($154,000) for our breadstuff®, and,
not having it to snare, will reduce the price of
"our cotton!!" Why, sir, it is mathematically
true, that, if one-tenth part of the value of British
goods consists of the " breadstuffs" consumed by
the labor employed in the production of the raw
materials, and afterwards in converting them into
goods, then we imported in 1845 thirty times as
much British breadstuffs in the form of goods as
she took from us in its raw condition; for instance,
in 1845 we imported $45,600,000 worth of her
goods, one-tenth of which is $4,560,000, while she
took but $154,236 worth of our breadstuffs, being
about one-thirtieth part. Assuming that one-tenth
of the value of goods consists of breadstuffs, (and
he believed this was short of the real amount,) and
this result is undeniable. Yet gentlemen are con-
stantly boasting of the importance of the English
markets for American breadstuffs; and this, in fact,
constituted the great topic of both the late message
and treasury report. And he would here state a
fact that would astonish the American people, and
especially the farmers of this country. It was
this: that for the last twenty-five years, from 1821
to 1846, while we imported from forty to fifty mil-
lions of dollars' worth of goods from Great Brit-
ain per annum, she took but one million of dollars
worth of all the provisions and breadstuffs of this
country. This fact was established by a tabic
which he had made from the official reports on
commerce and navigation, from their commence-
ment, in 1821, down to this time, which he had
had carefully revised and corrected by the librarian
of this House, and which he intended to append to
his speech. Butthe gentleman's interruption had
withdrawn his attention from the subject he was
discussing. When interrupted, he was enumera-
ting some of the luxuries on which the duties had
been reduced by the tariff of '46; he had mentioned
brandy and spirits. The next item, though email,
served to show the spirit and policy of that law:
he referred to cards. The duty on visiting cards
had been reduced from 80 to 30 per cent., and on
playing cards from 257 to 30 per cent. They take
seven-eighths of the tax off playing cards, and put
it on tea and coffee; and this was Democratic poli-
cy, the policy of the tariff of '46. The duties by
this act had been reduced on crown and cut glass,
chandeliers, &c., used by the rich, from 90 to 30
per cent.; on pimento, cloves, cassia, dates, &c.,
from 60 and 80 down to 40 per cent.; on ready-
made clothing, from 50 to 30; on silk hats and
shoes, from 50 to 30. The duties on all these lux-
uries, and many others, consumed by the rich, are
thus reduced, in most instances, more than one-
half; and then the Secretary and President turn
round and ask us to tax tea and coffee. No, sir,
let them restore and increase the duties on luxu-
ries, and then, if they have not revenue enough,
let them talk about a duty on tea and coffee. Let
them restore the three-and-a-half millions of reve-
nue they have lost by the* reduction of the duties
on cotton goods; the two millions on iron and its
manufactures; the million and a half they have lost
on sugar; the million on woollens, and the million
and a half on silk goods. Let them restore these
protective and revenue duties—restore the nine and
a half millions taken of these five articles. Let
them restore the $432,000 taken off brandy and
spirits. Let them do this, and then talk to us
' about a duty on tea and coffee. He asserted that,
i with some modification, the tariff of '42 could be
i made to yield forty millions, not only without pre-
' judice, but with positive benefit and advantage to
. the country; not by doubling the duties, as at the
; commencement of the last war, but simply by m-
] creasing the duties on luxuries, and some others,
for revenueand protection, extending them to some
of the articles made free by the tariff of '42, and
I making them specific. Such a tariff, while it would
I give ample revenue and protection, would truly
! "cover the country with benefits and blessings,"
j restore prosperity to every branch of the national
| industry, put the country upon its own vast and
! undeveloped resources, and give this Administra-
[ tion abundant means to sustain the public credit at
: this fearful crisis in our affairs. This was Whig
j policy; this was the measure the Whigs would
| adopt, if they had the power, instead of this mis-
, erable and pitiful attempt to put a duty on tea and
! coffee—a measure alike improper, unnecessary,
! and inadequate. Sir, restore the Whigs to power
! to-morrow, and, as in 1842, they would soon lift
j up this down-trodden and prostrate country. Do
j this, and peace and prosperity would be soon re-
! stored. Do this, and 
' [Here the hour expired, and Mr. S. resumed
' his seat.]
j Domestic articles, the growth and produce of the United States,
! exported from the United States into Great Britain, from
\ the commencement to the last of our official reports on Coin-
\ merce and Navigation.
