from those of General Pleasonton, that, with the exception of a few companies of infantry, he received any support from you. His men had marched seventy-eight miles during the previous twenty-four hours, and he states that in consequence of having so little assistance after holding them in check for two hours, they were allowed to escape across the river. Troops were placed at other points to prevent the rebels getting back into Virginia, and the commanding general relied upon you to intercept them if they came in your immediate vicinity. Hew now requires from you a written explanation of the reasons why you did not carry out the instructions communicated to you in my dispatch of 1 p. m. yesterday.

Chief of Staff.
