HEADQUARTERS NORTHERN BRIGADE,Hays' Creek, Reckbridge County, Va., February 22, 1864.

Major General J. A. EARLY,

Commanding Valley District:

GENERAL: Your letter of this date has been received. I will send a squadron down the valley to-morrow morning to relieve General Rosser's pickets below Woodstock, as directed. I will also move my camp day after to-morrow to my old camp ground, this side of Swoope's Depot. I would move to-morrow, but all my wagons have been sent out 15 miles from camp to-day in search of forage, and will not be in before to-morrow evening. Until Thomas' and Walker's brigades actually move from Rockingham, I presume there is no necessity for me to move the main body of my command to that county; and till that necessity exists it is of the utmost importance for me to remain as far south as possible, on account of forage. I shall be compelled after I go to Rockingham to haul most of my grain from this (Rockbridge) county; therefore every day that I can remain as far south as, say, Swoope's Depot I will save that much in transportation. I scarcely see how it will be possible for me to subsist my horses in Rockingham, when compelled to go there, with the limited transportation allowed by general orders. You are doubtless aware of the fact that Rockingham is nearly exhausted of forage and grain of all kinds, and that Shenandoah and the country below is so completely exhausted that it is with great difficulty and labor, and constant controversies that it is with great difficulty and labor, and constant controversies with the people, that even a small picket force can be supplied. My own horses are as much in need of rest as those of any brigade in the army, and I had hoped that for three or four weeks I could rest and feed them here. as that cannot be, however, I will go down to Augusta day after to-morrow, and hope that by furnishing the mounted picket to relieved General Rosser, you will permit me to remain there until orders are received for the return of Generals Thomas and Walker to the Army of Northern
