 ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE, No. 47.
 Richmond, May 6, 1864.

I. The following schedules of prices for articles named therein, adopted by commissioners appointed pursuant to law for the State of Virginia, are announced for the information of all concerned, and the special attention of officers and agents of the Government is directed thereto:

RICHMOND, VA. May 4, 1864.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON:

SIR: In reviewing the schedules of prices for May and June we invited the co-operation and aid of Mr. William B. Harrison, and it is just to add that the schedules received the unanimous approval of the commissioners.

We respectfully offer the accompanying schedules, A and B, with the understanding that the prices are to remain for the months of May and June, unless in the interval it should be deemed necessary to modify them.

The following prices are to be the maximum rates to be paid for the articles impressed in all cities and usual places of sale, and when impressed on the farms or elsewhere the same prices are to be paid.

Under existing circumstances we have deemed it not only just, but most likely to favor increased production, that producers in future should not be required to transport their surplus productions when impressed, but that the agents of the Government should employ or impress the neighborhood or county, wagons and teams to haul all such articles, and so divide the work between the owners of wagons and teams as to be least prejudicial to those successfully engaged in agriculture.
