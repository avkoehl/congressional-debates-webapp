to make it, a* it ü errorciu.ly e-lled, a mere fis

powers oí a large capital í< r discounts
Because, by permitting us notes to be signed by
branch officers, which the last charier did not, it
opens, a wide door to counterfeits, and fraudb on the
community.
Becaube it omits several bam ary restraints, found
to be proper by longei experu nee, much dtscussioi ,
and strong icdMnmg, since the list cha 'er btcam
a law.
It i-, benird the agx, as evinced m onr two most
commercial and intelligent S ates, an 1 in the opi-
nions ot our ablest ba ik ts, ny havm., no c ause to

Because i introduce^ new legislation as to the
value of all foreign gold coins for this institution,
without extending the same rule to all other corpo-
rations, and to ihe community at large
Because it doe* not require the Bank to perform
the duties of pension agent at all, noi even of com
mtssioner of Joans and manager of the great new
public debt about to b- incurred, untd required by
some future law
On the other hand, I rejoice tint, among he va
nous amendments already offered from this side of
the House, some have succeeded, and have thus
obviated part of the objections, on the scote of ex-
pediency, which before existed Thus, the dange-
rous parucipation of foreigners in t ie agen
cíes of the Government itself—and those foreign
erb often the high functionaries oí rival nations
—has, after strenuous opposition by most d the
friends of the Bank, been pieventedfrorn operating
in the direct manner id which it formerly prevai -
ed. And though they could not before be direc-
tors, or vote in elections, they could vote on all
other questionb tn person or by ptoxy, and help to
dispose of our property, and give instructions con-
cerning its management, very petn cious to our
interests and baneful tonubhc liberty I trust that
thp dangerottb mules of Philip, loaded with gold,
will thus be more "ffeo ually exc uded irom entering
the gateo of oui Republic So the removal of the
seal of secrecv in many of the doings ot ihe Bank,
and the publicity so necessary as a check on par-
'tiality, have been introduced to a considerable ex
tent, and, after much struggle with most of our op
ponents, have diminished the inexpediency which
otherwise would have existed, in chartenn ■ an in-
stitution shrouded m mystery, shut close often as
the dungeons of an inquisition or star chamber,
and hence the theatre of constant favoritism, mo-
nopoly, ana oppression ía the distribution of its
favois
Again- the limitation of the amount of discounts
to the directors, introduced to-day, hr-s imposed
some restraint m the careless loans which were
at times made to them un¿< the last char-
ter—even to the destruction of all llti capital
(of a million and a half) of the Baltimor., branch,
aided by a few other imprudent di.count Indeed,
the whole losses in the first three years exceeded
five and a half millions, and much of it by loans to
directors Bat the clause is still inexpedient, in
some degree, by allowing them any discounts
whatever, when three hundred and fifty-eight mil-
lions of other bank capital exists, scattered   over

whatever, for discount and circulatit n, is nice sa-
sary to a Bank since the first bank known in uii-
tory were mere banks ol deposite, and mce only

In order to effec all tt ese object, so very debi-

hons, and that in 1816, thirty-five m lions, this
ene should at leait, under the increase since of
wealth, population, and territory, be authorized as
high as fifty millions
But, sir, the increase of bank capital in a ratio
with the extension of our territory, is rather a no-
vel guide, unless the territory u cul vated, and the
wealth and population of the country hare been
enlarged so as to justify the measure
Going to our popu'ation and wealth, and suppos-
ng them to have betn doubled from 1791 to 1816,
tnen, by the chairman's rule of proportion, the
oar.k capital should be doubled; and if there were
lout millions of Sate bank i ap.tal m 1791, and
you added ten millions more of the Um'ed Slates,
the whole was fourteen millions, for a population
of between three and four millions of people  This

mis bill, been dt a rate more than twice as high a°
1 e hichist of thew, and moro than five times as
b h as to lowest Yet we now have almo i ¡he
insanity to propo e from thirty to fifty mil ions
more of that kind of capital We d> this, too,
in ihe face ot dear-bought exoerieici, when, by
our headlong and uncalculatmg course on this
subject, we laid the foundation 1oi enormous ex-
pansions and contractions in paper issues, which
so stimulated overtrading as to provoke severe
reactions and diffuse widespread loin withm the
last lew years
Let it n< t be said that some of the present ba >k
i apital is bi lly employed, or little effective, be-
cau c in 1816 su'l more of it was in that condi-
tion.
In truth wi *■ out this f ill, one of the gieat evils
tl tuc age is <■ suiplu> tt bank capital, and with it,
,!ii addition is ,oade where nore is needed, and
v hcie its amount is iixed by mere caprice or arbi-
trary dictatit «, and not in coi iorrnty to any rule
tf^oportion in fealth or numbers, and when
a to maaon can bring no result no likely to be

tiwns and new enterprise, io end in new revulsions
anl mm It this capital be formed by Cell cttons
f  im etber banks, either with hawing their depo-
m ^s on l aüd, er collecting in and transferring their
capital, a pressure s th  consequence, and more
or less sacrifice of property
It it comes from abroad, and is thus additional
capital imported, it will come when none is needed
for legttimite business, and will tend to stimulate
specula ion and ovtnssues as m 1794, and again
in 1818, till a reaction comes wuh all its inevitable
¿nd ruinous results
Tne chairman must adopt «orne new and wiser
guide in respect to the amount of his capital, or,
on these xacts, assent to my motion, and then
either refrain to fill the blank at all, because no
new bam cajital is needed, or fill it v.nh a diffe-
rent amount suited to some legitimate object.
Thus, if he desires that the capital should be suffi-
ciently large to furnish all tbe papei currercy of
th  country, and the present amount of it be not
tar from uhai is needed, then his capital snould
b- at least $300,000,000 or $350,000,000, instead
of $30 000 000. But that would lead inevitably
to t*ie destruction ol all the State bankb, and the
evils inseparable from collecting and transferring
suddenly their immense discounts of between four
and five hundred millions.   Who, then, too, is
