$300, and the third $3,0OQ Ho was sentenced
to be impiisoned thiee months on each indict-
ment, in all nine months, but though imprisoned
in August, 1829, he was not released untilMaich,
1833 Kept in jail three years and six months
foi a real oi factitious defalcation of $3,050'
Where are now the defaulteis of this refoim
Administration > Wheie is ¡swartwout, after em-
bezzling public money foi eight years in succes-
sion, til 1 he had taken and carried away $1,250,000?
Where is Puce '  Where is Giatiot'   How long
since their carriage wheels proudly hurled the
Olympic dust of the fashionable streets and ave-
nues of your metropolis of couit and of fashion '
No maishals at their heels, no distuct attorneys
prosecuting against them tuple indictments, tliey
lan away, or walked away, unforbidden, and
none to hmdei' Where is Boyd > that land office
defaultei, who appealed to " the misfortunes of spec-
ulation" to elect lnm to the ¡senate of Ins State of
Mississippi'    These aie all innocent and unfor
túnate  oi   escaping defaulters'    These are full-
handed public plundcreis, pet plunderers, and go
" unwhipped of justice "    Sir, so was Tobias
Watkins unfortunate     He was born and bred a
gentleman, dazzled by the tinsel glare of this me-
tropolis of " splendid misery and shabby splen-
doi "—a*- it was once, with equal foice, ttuth.and
beauty, descubed by that unequaled oratoi  of
Vnginia, John Randolph—of liberal mind, and
habits, too, he lavished some three thousand lm-
piovidently, thinking in his heart that he should
be able to replace that sum, and more, and "make
all sti light," and he was lmpusontd foi his lm
piud  nee foi netily foul yeais,and made to bear
i ft Inn's biand ' Ah,sn, but he was a. gentleman,
he belonged to " all the decency," to the " silk-
stocking gentiy," he was not one of your Loco-
foco defaulters,  he was  not im/orittnafe to the
amount of millions, he was no íobber on a laige
scale  lit was notone toofull handed to be touched
ay the rude hands of the tipstaff, he was not a
lefaulter of the gieat Democracy, and, poor fel-
ow, he sufftied foi being a gentleman '   By the
oy, sir, that woid reminds me of the fact that it
jvas duiing, oi not until the past summei,youi
oaityfiisi discoveied  that your Piesidcnt was a
gentleman ' The discovery was made fust, I think,
by granny Ritchie    That veneiable gLntleman
took me to task foi finding some gentlemen in
Petersburg, and, as a set-oft, it seemed, boasted
thatPiesidentVan Buien,too, was actually agen-
llemin '    Very stiange, that a man whom they
made Piesident, the succesboi of the " illusti ious"
m 1837, they did not find out to be a gentleman
until the summei of 1833' They mnstsurely have
been trying to main him out a Whig     I or my-
self, I ilways knew lie was, in the oidinaiy sense,
a gentleman, and it was moitifying to me to see
that the  Enqunei,by implication  at least, had 1
supposed  until lately that the Piesidmt of the
United States could be other than a gentleman-
judging,! mean, fiom its boast of the sudden dis
covciy, but my colleague there [Mi  Diiomoooli.]
will not, however, íecognize Mi   Ritchie as a
genuine Locofoco editoi
Mi   DROMGOOLE    No, no, he is a consciv-
alive
Theie is a eheenng consideration connected
with this discovery, though by the Admmistia
(ion press, it is the bughtest omen which hasoc
cuned foi yeais of Mi Van Buien's downfall
Yes, sn, that cry of "gentleman" upon him by
his fi lends will finish him—with the party which
suppoits him, they might as well have critd "mad
dog'" It is aceiiain prognostic that he is going
down Tiom the hour that father Ritchie made
that fatal discovery, the man's doom was sealed
But, sir, the gentleman defaulter, Watkins, as I
was saying, met his fate, and now that he has
been punfied by the fiits of the law, ve may be
permitted to do him justice, and to make him the
mstiumentofretubution I call him up, I invoke
his wrongs, his suffeungs, his injuries,, his expi
ation, to use in judgment against his pusccutois
to condemn them Wheie is he now In asta
tion where he is, no doubt, fai happier than in
his day of piecanous and tenor haunted bhow,
when he toiled as a poor shvt in one of the stalls
of your document faetones called Depirtments
He is now an humble apothecary, and heie I will
say, for the benefit of all who would be honest,
and who wish to be clean, that he keeps for sale
the veiy best of " palm soap" and chloride of lime,
and other chemical compositions, to take off the
spots of ¡ocofoeoism, and to cleanse from all cor-
ruption1 I recommend to certain sub-Tieasury
gentlemen to go and buy,butwhat if they beonce
washed white as snow, they will, like the hog,
return to their wallowing in the mire.
The Administration may pretend that they wish
investigation It is full time But how is the
matter pressed ' Every now and then the ehan-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means [Mr
Cambiifleng] comes forward, and, in solemn
tone, asks you to diop the subject foi what he is
pleased to teim "Business," as if it was not the
business of this House, and its chief duty now-
a-days, to look into abuses Sn, "the party" are
in reality, at heait, as much opposed to mquny
now as of old It serves then turn at thu> time
to pietend to be diligent and zealous foi lnquny
They are no moie itb fuends now than they ever
weie
Mr CAMBRELENG    I hope the gentleman
will not do me injustice     I nevei voted against
any of his investigations     Nevei
Mr WISE     I said youi party
Mi   CAMBRELENG     My parly,   ha' ha'
That is another affair
Mr WISE Yes, sir, I believe the gentleman
is " anothei affair" since the New York election
And now that the iniquities of your paityaie
daily coming to light, now that concealment is
no longer possible, eveiy man of " the paity" is
prompt to exclaim, " you can't say/did it'"—the
party itself must be busk to make the disclaim-
pi, lest the people set all down as rogues together,
those who are found out, and those who aie not
The people are beginning to compare Watkins
with Swaitwout—hundieds of cases of defalca-
tion with one—thirteen millions of expenditure
with thirty oi foi ty millions—and to see that the
administration of Adams, however bad, was, in
comparison with the iniquities of this dynasty,
about as Watkins to Swartwout—$3,050 to
$1,225,000'—thirteen millions to forty millions
—one case of defalcation severely punished, to
one hundred not only uniebuked, but counte-
nanced and connived at1
And this, sn, bungs me to the message of this
session So enormous, appalling, have your in-
iquities grown, that at one time we were called to
an extra session to cure one system of experi-
ments, and again another system's blotches and
blams aie the special subjects of Executive com
munications The Piesident himself, in self de-
fence, and Mr Secretary, are compelled to ac-
knowledge them in otder to account for them
This message of Mr Van Buren dnectly contra
diets the letter and certificate of his " illustrious
pitdeeessoi " He confesses thatall the Depait-
ments are not, and were not, sound, and is all in
a huriah foi investigation     Let us see
" A change in the office of collector, at one of our pnn
ci.nl p >rt  Ins brought to light a ileflleation of tlit srivest
thaiaetci the paiticulirs of which will be laid before you
in i special report liom the Secretary of the I leasury Uy
111  report,and the iccotnpanjingdocuments it will b( seen
that ¡he u-eel ty returns 0/ the defaulting officer appare Mr!
cxhiht d thron'hout, a faithful administration ofthe affairs
Mti u Ic I to his management '
Sn, quel c de hoc ' 1 will endeavor to show you
directly that this, is an erroi, that "the weekly
leturns," if they had been piopeily examined
and eompaied in the Secietary's office, would
have detected and exhibited the very reveise of |
" a faithful administration " long ago But the
Piesident pioceeds
"It, however now apprars that he commenced abstract   j
in" the public money shortl; after his appointment, and con
tmuccl to do so  progressively increasing the amount for the |
term of more than seven years  embracing a portion of the j
peuod during which the public moneys were deposited in
the Hank ot the tinted blates the whole of that oi the
Stite bank deposit s\ stem, and coniluding onlj on his u
tirement from office '  &c
Su,this is a confession which tallies well with
the lllustnous piedecossor's certificate of tne
"ability and integnty" of the Departments m
December, 1836
' Ihewavin v/lnell tin  defalcation was so Ion,'eon
coaled a , 1 tin step, U ven to indem.fv the LniteJ slates,
as lar as practical) e agiuist l( ss, w.ll «Uo be presented to
vou 1 ho cast is one which imperatively claims tile atteri
tioa of Congress, and furnishes the strongest motive Jor the
establishment of a more severe and secure system for the
safe keeping and disbursement of the public moneys than
any that has heretofore existed "
Ay, sir, and from this we learn the most extra-
ordinary deduction that this defalcation of a sub-
(i easurer, of the " gravest character," is an argu-
ment to recommend to aurfavorthesufe-Treasuij
system'
" It seems proper, at all events, that, by an early enact-
ment, similar to that of other countries, the application of
public money by an officer of Government to private uses
should be made a felony, and visited by severe ana ignomini-
ous punishment "
I will soon show you, sir, that millions of the
public money have been applied by officers of the
Government to private uses, with the knowledge
of the Administration
" The Government, it must be admitted, has been, from
us commencement, comparativelv fortunate m tins respect
But the appointing power cannot always he wt 11 ndvised in
its selections, and the c\penence ot every country has
shown that public officers are not at all times proof against
temptation "
Is the Government fortunate in this respect'
Can any one tell us how much we have lost?
We have certainly been taught of late that Gov-
ernment officers are not always proof against
temptation, and we mav all verily pray that part
of the Loi d 's prayei which prays " Lead us not
into temptation'
" ff a moit direct cooperation on the part of Congress
m the supervision oí the conduct ot the officers intiusted
with the custody and npplic ilion of the pub! c money is
deemed desirable it will uve me pleasure to assist m the
estabhshmi nt of any judicious and constitutional plan by
which that object may be accomplished "
Now, sir, what would the Piesident considera
judicious and constitutional plan ' We lecollect
that his lllustnous piedece3soi consideied acom-
mittee to report to Congiess as worse than a
Spanish Inquisition What is Mr Van Buren's
plan'   We will soon see
" I submit to vour consideration whether a committee of
Congress might not be profitably (mploycd in inspecting, at
such intervals as might be deemed pioper the affairs and
the accounts of officers intrusted with the custody of the
public moneys The trcquent performance of this duty
might be made obhgatoiy on the committee m respect to
those officers who h ive large sums in their possession, and
left discretionary with respect to others "
Sir, all this would seem to be reversing the rule
and line of conduct put sued by General Jackson.
He would seem to be coming at last to my doc-
trine of inquiry and investigation But no, sir,
hear him
"They might report to the Fxecutue such defalcations as
weie found to exi*t, with a view to apiompt remoial from
office unless the default was satisfactorily accounted for,'1
&c
Ah, sn, here the mysteiy is solved Here is
the clew to all executive concession—it is but
another step to executive aggrandizement The
committee oj Congress is to report to the Executive,
is it? A committee of Congress is to tiavel all
over the United States, as Executive servants, to
supcivise the offietis of a Piesident who isswom
to see that the laws aie faithfully executed And
pray, what have we an Executive for? Why
have we a President, and S< eictaiy, and Audit-
ois, and Comptiollerb, with plenaiy poweis, to
do this veiy service > Could //¡ft/ not have done
this, whenevirthi y pleased to do their duties,
foi the last nine yeais? We are to conveit our
committees into misbionarits This House is to
be a new soit of " Ameuoan Board," with this
difleience, that, instead of being missionaries of
Christ, we are to be missionaries of Mr Presi-
dent Van Buren' General Jackson claimed it as
the duty and prerogative of the Executive alone
to see that his subordinates executed the laws
faithfully, but his successor asks Congress to
peiform the executive duties for him Does Mr.
Van Buien mean to say that it has been for want
of such congressional aid heietofore that there
has been no such supeivision by the Executive'
' That thtie lias been no such supervibion is true,
I but that such aid was wanting, or necessaiy, is
i not title The Piesident has always had the fuU
powei of this supeivision, he might ha\e found
some honest men of his own party fit foi olfices,
I and have appointed honebt commissioners to su-
pervise those who wc e not fit I his, sir, is an
nisupuablt objection, that the Piesident not only
i, asks us to go out of our usual couise, but to oe-
I come meiged in the Executive    What, sir, is
