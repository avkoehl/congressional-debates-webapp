HEADQUARTERS,September 7, 1864.

General BRAGG:

Sherman still occupies his works one mile and a half beyond Jonesborough. He visited our wounded in hospital at that place, stating he was going to Atlanta to rest, and then he was going to Andersonville. I give you this for what it is worth. It is not of the first importance to remove the prisoners and get as soon as possible all the troops we can from Kirby Smith?

J. B. HOOD,

General.

LOVEJOY'S, September 7, 1864.

General BRAGG:

Enemy has left Jonesborough. Has gone in direction of Atlanta.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
