Commanding Cavalry Corps, in the Field:

GENERAL: The lieutenant - General commanding directs that you furnish him at the earliest practicable moment with any information you may have relative to the enemy's movement toward the Oconee - whether he is going directly toward the railroad bridge from this side, or is moving to cross the river below the railroad bridge, with the view of striking the railroad again at Davisborough or Tennille; and also such information as you may have from General Wayne, who, when last heard from, was proceeding to east side of the Oconee to take position at railroad bridges, with eleven pieces of artillery and about 500 or 600 men. If you possess any information on these points when this reaches you, you will communicate it at once to these headquarters.
