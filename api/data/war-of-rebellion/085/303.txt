HEADQUARTERS THIRD SUB-DISTRICT OF SAINT LOUIS,Pilot Knob, Mo., September 22, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER FORTY-SEVENTH MISSOURI INFANTRY:

The major commanding directs me to instruct you to order the different companies of your regiment stationed at this post to concentrate at Fort Davidson, and to remain in and about the fort until further orders, prepared for action at a moment's warning. They will leave a small guard at their company quarters to prevent the stealing of any property. Captain Dinger's company is not excepted, and will also be ordered in.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. D. O. KELLMAN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Brigadier-General EWING:

Captain Sells is just in with his forces. He evacuated Bloomfield and fell back on the Sikeston road. His rear was attacked at the Castor about daylight.

He formed in line and repulsed them again. From what I can learn there was at least 200 men moving against Bloomfield.
