Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

The general directs that you need do nothing further to-day than cross Lynch's Creek, with everything in readiness to move to-morrow. When you move, keep the column well closed up. It is reported by deserters that General Hardee is moving from Florence toward Charlotte with 100 guans and a long train, with about 4,000 or 5,000 men guarding them. The general wishes you to find out all you can in regard to his movements. The rear of his column was supposed to be at Cheraw last night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A.m. VAN YKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
