CINCINNATI, December 20, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

Have you any intelligence of Morgan's movements this morning? If he attempts crossing at or near Hartsville, Bruce ought not to move farther from Bowling Green at present, as he may be wanted in that vicinity.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 20, 1862.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Cincinnati:

We learn that Morgan is still encamped on the south side of the river, near Hartsville. Think he has about 4,000 men. Force at Bowling Green already large. Think Bruce ought to move to Clarksville, which is fortified; that would stop chance of Forrest co-operating with Morgan. Tennessee troops also at Bowling Green available.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 20, 1862.

Major-General HORATIO G. WRIGHT:

General Manson has been ordered to relieve General Granger at Bowling Gree. General Granger has been ordered here.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
