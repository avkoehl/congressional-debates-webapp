THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

without a word. I dome that the time of the
committee should bo taken up in discussing the
abuses in the Army and Navy rather than upon
these little items.
The amendment proposed'by Mr. Smith, of
Virginia, was not agreed to.
Mr. CURRY. I move to strike out the fol-
lowing clause, in order to make it conform to
what the committee has already done:
"To pay John C. Rive« one cent for every five pages oftlie
Congiefcbional Globe and Appendix when the tame exceeds
! three thousand pages tor a long session of Congtcss, and
: fifteen bundled pages ar. a  ]iou session of Congre.s^. per

the law upon which this appropriation is founded.
It is as follows:
t: Jlinl be it further enacted, That there shall be paid to
John <J. Rives, by the Secretory ol the Senate and Oleik of
the llon^e of Representatives, out ol the contingent fund of
the two llons-os., accoiding to*the number ol copies of the
Congressional Globe and Appendix taken by each, one cent
for evety five pages ol that work exceeding three thousand
pages fei a long fce&sjon, and fifteen hundred pages for a
tefoort onG, including the Indexes and Laws of the United
Stares, commencing w ith this session."
Mr. CURRY withdrew his amendment.
Mr. CURRY. I move to strike out the follow-
ing paragraph:
" For the usual additional compensation to the reporters
for the CongiosMonal Globe, for lepoiting the pioceedings
of the Hoine of Kepres-entatives for the first fcesaion of the
Tim ty-fc^rvth Congiess, $800 each, $4,000." |
There is no law for that; but it seems to have
grown up year by year in the appropriation bills.
The Committee of Ways and Means have re-
ported it, I presume, because it has been voted for
several years past. 1 move to strike it out; be-
cause the committee have agreed to strike out all
the preceding paragraphs in reference to the ,
Globe.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. I oppose the
amendment submitted by the gentleman from
Alabama.
Mr. DEAN demanded tellers. •
Mr. GROW. This clause ought to be left as
it is. If there be no reporting, there will be no
reporters to receive extra compensation.
Tellers were ordered; and Messis. Bliss and
John Cochrane were appointed.
The committee divided; and the tellers reported
—ayes 22, noes 97.
So the amendment was disagreed to.
The Clerk read the following paragraph:
" For component ion of libianan, three assistant libraiians,
and messenger, $9,000."
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I do not desire to
cut off appropiiations that may be necessary; but
this one, it seems to me, is not of that character.
I would inquire whether, in the judgment of the
Committee of Ways and Means, three assistants
and one messenger are necessary for this library?
INine thousand dollars for taking rare of this one
library is a \ery large sum for this Government
to pay. 1 move to strike out the words " three
assistants and one messenger," and to reduce the
appropriation to#3,0li0. 1 believe that the libra-
rian enn perfoim ail the duties that may be in-
volved.
Mr. PIIELPS, of Missouri. I oppose the
amendment, and will merely remark that this
sum, which is proposed to be appropriated, con-
forms to the provisions of law. rI he law provides
for three assistants and one messenger, and fixes
the salary of each.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I have not yet
yielded the floor; and I have now. to say to the
gentleman that in what he lias said there is no
reason given why three assistant libraiians and
this messenger are needed. He might make the
same declaration about all of the appropriations
in this bill: that they are fixed by law. There
may be a law creating these offices of assistant
librarians; but that, sir, imposes upon us no ne-
cessity to continue them, if they aie useless. We
can refuse this appropriation for the next year,
and then repeal the law creating these offices. In
order to accomplish that object, I make the mo-
tion I have indicated.
The. amendment was rejected.
The Clerk read the next clause, as follows:
(c Foi puieha'-e of books for said library, $5,000.
Mr. BLAIR. I move to add to that paragraph
the following:
And that the same, or a s-uflicient pait thereof, be ap-
plied To llie piucha-e of one hundred copies of Benton's
Abndgment of the Debates of Congress lor the congres-
sional library and the libraries of the Huuso of Represent-
atives and of the Senate.
Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. Is that amend-
ment in order?
The CHAIRMAN, (Mr. Branch occupying
the chair temporarily.) The Chair holds that the
amendment is not in order, as it is not authorized
by any law.
Mr. GROW. It is pertinent; for the paragraph
to which it is proposed to be added provides for
the purchase of books.
Mr. BLAIR. 1 take an appeal from the de«i-
sion of the Chair. There is no law for the pur-
