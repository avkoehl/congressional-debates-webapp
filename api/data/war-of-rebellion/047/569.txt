HEADQUARTERS THIRD DISTRICT, SOUTH CAROLINA, Pocotaligo, December 22, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: There has been an increase of force of the enemy in my front. As far as I can estimate, from available data, I should judge their numbers to be about 6,000. I would desire to know how far this increase has come form their forces on the islands in front of and rear Charleston, if such information is in your possession. I would be obliged to you to inform me, also, what is supposed to be their present land force in front of Charleston.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. WALKER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA, Charleston, S. C., December 24, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded to the War Department, for its information.

No visible diminution of troops has yet taken place on Morris, Folly, or Kiawah Island, where the enemy has probably about 10,000 men in all. They probably have about a like number in and around Port Royal and Hilton Head. I telegraphed yesterday for two brigades of good troops to send to the protection of the Third Military District of South Carolina (Walker's), and the approaches thence to Savannah. I hope they may be furnished from the troops which I sent last spring-Walker's (W. H. T.) division-to the assistance of General Of, and which are now with General Johnston. Should his forces go into winter quarters, it is hoped that division may be temporarily returned for the above service.
