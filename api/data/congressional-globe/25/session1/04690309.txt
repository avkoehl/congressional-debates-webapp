Making public officers depositories—Mr. Pope.

secured by the owners fiom fue and robbeiy, and placed m
good banks, and put in circulan n by the banks, to aid the en
terpnse, industry and business of the people But to secure
these advantages, and augment m this way the active capital,
of the community, it is necessary that the banks should Le
sound, and have tl efirm confidence of the peop'e
Banks, in their origin in Europe, were places of deposite and
of inspection for money, to pievent clipping or dibasing the
coin The checks of the depositor  passed Aom hand to hand
as money, and being convertible at ail times into specie, this
species of tranter was called bank money, so the Botes of the
Rank of England and of the Bank of the United Statps, while
convertible into specie, may be propeily denominated bank
money To give to paper, m the foim oí bank notes, the cha
racter of money, it is necessaiy «o to o ganizo and íegulate oui
banking system as to secure to the holder of a note the powei
of convutmg it into gold and bilver at all times, and this we
have never been able to do uniformly, but by the agency of a
na'ional institution The banking and paper credit of Great
Britain has been cairied to i greater extent than that of any
nation m Europe, and under its operation and influence she
has become the first commercial anJ naval Power in the woild
When Bonaparte, («aid Mr- Pope,) wa* preparing to invade
England with a million of sokheis, the timid part of toe nation
became alarmed, and made a run upon the bank, in order to
piepare for fliaht from the kingdom in the event of Bonapam's
success, and this, with othei cau&es, foiced a su-pension of
specie payments, and yet England, with this suspension, mam
tame! a war asamst neaiíyaíl Emope for more than twenty
years—triumphed over the combined fleets of Fiance and
Spam in two decisive rictoues, at Trafalgar and the Nile, and
earned her power and domination to regions where the Ro
man eagles nevei flpw when mistress of the world, and there
would seem to be no limit to her domination, but foi the rising
greatness of this Jlepublic
It was, said Mi Pope, the Anglo Paion spirit of this peo
pie that gave us independence, and this nation, if united, will,
at no distant period, rival Great Britain in commerce, and
check her biipieme dominion ón the ocean
What, Mr Chan man, said Mr Pope, has been the effect of
the hanking system and paper ciedit m this country? It com
menced more than fitty years ago, has expanded with the
growth of the nation, and, m less than half a century, under
oui present Constitution, we liave risen horn a small be 'inning
to be the second commercial nation m the civilized woild
Our navigation has increased, our Lountiy has lrnpioved, with
astonishing rapidity, in wealth and internal impiovements of
every kind, our population has expanded to the far West,
where the wilderness has been made to blossom like the rose,
under the operation and influence of this, banking system so
much denounced of late
Banks are useful, not only m aiding the sreneial op^Mtions of
commeiee, but they place (be pool and wealthy o i m Jie equal
ground Young men of ent rprise, industry, and good habits,
can generally, with the aid of ftiends, obtam«Joans, on mode
rate interest, to embark m trade and business, and thousands,
said Mr Pope, of enterprising young men without capital,
with a little credit, have risen from poverty to opulence I
know, too, said he, that the branches of the United sStates Bank
established in Kentucky, after all other banks were wound up
there, diffused their loans and accommodations to the people
of my State as fairly and usefully, and, indeed, more so than
other bank ever did, and without interfering m our party con
tests I believe, said Mr Pope, no institutions were ever less
hable to such an imputation
Mr Chairman, I have now to say to my friends from Virgi
ma, who oppose this bill, and insist that thefetate banks shall be
continued as depositmies of the public mono), that while 1 do
not believe that thi Government ought to depend on the agent y
of banks undei tente authmity, 1 will vote with them to make
general and special depositts m those banks in pieference to
the bill under debate, ard I lnpe «taid Mr Pope, if the amend
jnent proposed in favor of State banks, should be rejected, that
my fuends lrom Virginia will unite with me foi a Bank of the
United States They will answer me, piobably, sud Mr Pope,
that they cannot do this, because it is fotbidd^n by the ronstitu
tional doctrines of Vngmia, which, ho mutt confess, he had
never been able to understand, although born in Vimma, often
an actor on the political theatre and a suppoiter oí three Vir-
ginia Presidents—Jefferson, Madison, and Momoe If, said
Mr Pope, these distinguished men are to be considered the
elders of the Virginia political dun eh, with the adhtion of the
late Mr Ciawfoid, born m Virginia, and supported for the
Piesidency by that State, we shall be still more at a loss to un
derstand what is meant by the Vugmia doctrines, and we shall
probably find them like the doctunesof most othei State*—one
rule of iaith m theory, and anothei in practice
It has been generally supposed that the Vngmia statesmen
ol the Jefleisou or Republican school weie opposed to the ex
ercise ol implied oi conductive poweis or at lea * thu they
are mue s net emstiuctiomsts than others that they aie
opposed to the exercise ot poweis not expressly girted and
so am I Mr Chan na i II there is any plain lino of c"t maica
tiou between the opinions of Virginia p ilitioians and otbeis, in
legard m the poweis of «his Government, I have never been
able to diaoovei it
It is true that pai ties have difleietl about the power tu pass
particulai measmes, but there is no geneial h l« of enrstrue
tion on which the statesmen of this countiy havediffeied, at
least m piaetice    Tho^e m opposition have, undei eveiy Ad
nnnisuation, atmiled the constitutionality of m«asmc alopted
by those in powei   and those in power have untfoiinly e^et
«sad all the poweis in th<-it opinion necessaiy and piopci to
sustain their policy and accomplish their objects    li pohti
cians of the Vu..imi sch ml hivt    in   piactice,   obseived a
more strict consttm non of the I ms muion thin otlieis, I have
in vain, slid Mi   Pope looke! ior evidence of the tact    Mi
Ietfeis0n,Mr Madison, and Mr Momoe, united in the puichisc
of Louisiana  a (d its muupo-iaiion i ito the United State*, the
constitutionality oí which was conüoveited by the statesmen
of the Eistein «tot* !., and the co iccm? s ol then constitu
tional obieetions wis admitted by Mi    Teft*i-on himself but
he justified the act on the gioun i oi nece sity    He considered
the acquisition necessary, to secure to the West a fiee outlet
to  the ocean   and to pieseivethe Union     After this, a law
passed Congress to esMhhsh a hi inch of the United ¡States Ban]
at New Oileans, which the bank had no right to do undei her
charter, and, therefore, that act must be considered in then i
ture of an original proposition, and it leceived the sanction of
Mr Jefferson, then President of the United Slates, and other
laws were, I believe, passed duung his Admmistiation to pro
tect this unconstitutional monster
Mr Pope said that among the first acts for which he ever
voted in Congress, was the embargo recommended by President
Jeffeison, m the winter ot 1 07, for which theie is no express
grant of power m the Constitution, unless embraced by the
clause authoiizing Congress to pass all laws necessary and
proper to carry into eifect the powers gianted, etc or the
power may be implied as incidental to the powers to declare
war and íegulate commerce The public men from the East
ern States, or many of them, contended that, undei a power to
regulate commerce, Congress had no powei to destioy com
merce The law, without limitation as to time, declared that
no ship or vessel should depart from any pou or place in the
United átate*, loi any foieign country, certainly one of the
strongest measures evei hazaided by any Government
Mi Chairman, said Mt Pope, Ido not intend to be under
stood as questioning the constitutionality ol the embargo law
At an early petiod ol this Government, I think, aaid Mr Pope,
the Virginia statesmen supported the constitutionality and ex
pediency ol ptotecting and encouraging American navigation,
by imposing discriminating dunes on foieign vessels, and, until
lately they idmmedthepo \ci of Coogie<=s to pa^s a protecting
tariff In theyear 1781 the continent Congiess, composed of
the most godlike men foi wisdom and elevated patrio*mil ever
assembled und^rtnesun, pa^ed the fiiat national buik, called
the Bank of Njrth Amenca, ten Slates voting for it, of which
Vngmia was one, and tinee against it After the next bank,
first under tb s Constitution, had passed both Hou&es of Con-
gress, and b< en presented to President Washingto . ior his sig
nature, m consequence of «jme opposition to it m Congress
on constitutional grounds, Geneial Washington, with that cau
tion and prudent circumspection which characterized his course
through life, called on his cabinet for their written opinions on
the constitutional question, and after íeceiving and considering
them without refeience to men or pames, (for he was above all
party,) with tha* practical wisdom and Joiecast for which he
was distinguished, approved the law Yes, «ir, this lather of
his country, this Virginia Ptesident, decided that a national
bank was constitutional
In 1816, Mr Madison and Mi Monroe regaulless of previous
commitments, bowed to the voice of necessity and experience,
aud sacuficed their consistency on the altai of their country's
good Virginia, said Mr Pope, supported Mr C law ford, a de
cided supporter of a national bank, foi the Presidency, and m
that vole, according to the notions of the day, hasdeclaied in
íavor of anational bank While on this subject I will add to
the authority of Virginia statesmen the opinions of Mi Gallatin.
Mr Dallas, Mr McLean and others mi «lit be menu jned, the
most enlightened fin tin lers in the country, a ho have from a
thorough and pi actical knowledge of the nenes? íy md utility
of^u h n nii notion, toncimed n npm o i with the distm
gushed mn to wno e *u hoii'y I have tppealed May I be
permitted, continued Mr Pope, toieferto die decisions of the
Congress of 1791,I8!6,and lfr32,as high authorities in favor ot
a national bank?
In the face of this high authority, the experience of forty
years of our national existence, and admonished by the present
disturbed condition of the country, it is given out m speeches,
and strongly intimated by the President in his Message, that he
wiil put his veto on any bill for the creation of anational bank,
and he speaks furthei, said Mi Pope, m his Message, of the per
severing opposition of the people of the United States to a na
tional bank, and seems to suppose his election a high evidence
of public opinion on this question    The conclusion he draws
from the etent of his election, fmmshes \ery slender evidence
on this point, for it never h is happened that any Pi evidential
election has turne 1 on anv one political question     The choice
of the peop'e, co itinued Mi   Pope, of a PitMdent is influenced
by vanois consideiations and rateiy *i h íelercnce to any par
ticular quostwnor principle, and,  besides, nought to be iccol
1-cted that tne bank question had been disponed of long before
his election, and could not have been the only ground of selec
tion     But, continued Mr   Pope, if they decided against a na
tional bank, they must have declared in favoi of Slate banks
In pulling down t e Bank of the United States, it wasdisti nly
announced to the nation, not that bank agency would be dis-
pensed with, but that State banks would answer the purpose
better    The people, therefore, if they decided any thing, have
approved the substitute presented to them by those iugh. in
authority, who now acknowledge that the substitute of S ate
banks has failed, and hence it is but fur to contend that the peo
pie have only declared against a bank on the condition that the
¡state banks would fulfil then  expectation*, and, theiefore, it
would seem to be still m open question   or the decision  is in
favor of a national bank    If anv thing his been decided, con
tmued Mr   P'P^j it was the question between the Administra
tion and the late bank, on the ground of imputed misconduct on
then pau and not the general question of a national bank    He
was not sufficiently acquainted with the facts to decide on the
merits oi dements of the late bank, he had thought it indi creet
in them to i sue pubheitions concerning the controversy with
the Government, hetanseitdiUhem no service and subjected
them to the imputation of mterfein1£ in the elections and poll
tics of the country     For thi-. course ¡heie miy hive been some
excuse onthescoieof eit defence    I certainly revei hi aid of
any charge of the kind against the bink b foie their contest
with the Admmistiaiion, and the bianihesm Kentucky he be
heved had acted fanly and usefully and t> the satisfaction of
all  paities    I neither, Mr   Chairman,   imdeistmd the facts
involved in the couti i\ersy, nor am  I dsposel to concern
in the diseu ston of 'hem     I   aoi  ioi   a  good bank  under

oi menace he miv ^ive of a vet , and I deny his iu'h in this
wav to dictate to oi influence the deliberations ol the 'e 'sljtive
body    In doing so he depaits from the «¡pheie of action as
signed to him by the Constitution of his country From what
part or clause of that instrument does he derive the right to tell
the Legislature that he will not co operate in measures deemed
by them necesr*uy for the good of the people?
The Cons itution makes, it the duty of the President, from
time to time to give to the Congress information of the Union,
and lecommend u  their consideration such measures as he
shall judse necessary and expedient, but on what partorclause
he claims the right to tell the Congress of those things they
ought not, or shall not do, I am yet, said Mr Pope, to learn
The veto power was vested m the President, said he to protect
him against encroachments of the Legislature Itis, to the Piesi
d. nt, a conservative powei, and may, in extraordinary occa
sions, be interposed to stay, for a time, rash and intemperate
measures pioceedng from high party or popular excitement,
and pregnant with very disastrous consequences to the nation,
and m sucha possible case, not likely often to occur, the Presi
dent may interpose to throw back the subject on the considera
tton of the people, but when it goes through the ciucibleof
investigation, and is presented as their settfed and deliberate
will in relation to matters of concern to the whole nation, I can
not imagine a ca*e where the President could rightfully use his
veto to defeat the popular will, and the case is not materially
different in toward to constitutional questions After the nation
ha« long considered and deliberately decided a constitutional
question, the Ptesident must co operate with the legislative
department, not as he understands it, but as understood by the
intelligence of the great community, for whose benefit it was
made The popular will, clearly and deliberately expressed,
must contiol the course of this free Government, and especially
en subjects ot doubtful policy, and doubtful constitutional
power
To illustrate and support my views of this velo power, Mr.
Pope said he would call the attention of the committee to the
last paragi aph of Mr Jefferson's letter to General Washington,
on the bank question, in the year 1791 Mr Jefferson, after
expressing his opinions against the bank, well concludes by
telling President Washington that, unless his mind, on a view
ol every thing, was tolerably clear that it was unconstitutional,
if the pro and con hung so equal as to balanee his judgment, a
j ust respect for the wisdom of the Legislature would decide the
balance in favor of then opinion, it is chiefly for cases where
they are clearly misled by error, ambition, or interest, that the
Constitution has placed a check in the negative of the Prest
dent This opinion was given to the President at the first
session the bank question was agitated in Congress, and before
it had been discussed or decided on by the People How much
stronger is the case now, after we have made two successftn
experiments of twenty years each, after the constitutional
power has been three times asserted by large maiormes of noth
Houses of Congio s confirmed by all the othei departments oi
Govi i mient, axi 1 snppoited by the opinions ol a 11st of the
most enligh eued statesmen and patriots ol this country i Li t
it be remembered, said ftir Pope, that thechartei of a national
bank does not invade the Executive or Judiciary, and can only
intrench, if unconstitutional, upon the rights reserved to the
States and the People, and is a measure which concerns the
interest of the People at large
If, continued Mr Pope, the People and the States, from a
conviction of the necessity and utility of such an institution,
should call on Congress to establish a bank, on what ground
could the President rightfully interfere % Should this measure
pass both Houses of Congress in conformity to the public will,
I cannot believe it possible, said Mr Pope, that h* would ven-
ture a veto, but should he, m defianee of the public will, do an
act so subveisive of the great principle of self government, for
which our ancestors bled, I trust that another Patrick Henry
\\ ill rise on this floor and remind those clothed in a little brief
authority here, thatCa?sir lvul his Brutus, Charles his Crorn
well, and that they had better profit by their fate Sir, this
menace of a veto has no precedent in our history, exceptan
opinion expressed in a message of Mr Monroe about the ap-
propriation of money for roadsj for which he was censured by
a fnend on this floor The British monarch would not dare to
threaten a Parliament with a veto on a measure demanded by
the voice and interest of the nation The veto power, placed,
continued Mr Pope, as a shield to protect the Executive and
othei departments against the invasions of the Legislature, and
to stay, for a moment, rash and intemperate action, was never
designed by our Constitution to defeat the deliberate will of the
nation in relation to measures of general interest
I will not, Mr Chairman, said Mr Pope, say any more, on
this occasion, of the veto power or its exercise, but will proceed
to notice verybneflv, the amendment offered by a gentleman
from Virginia (Mr Girland) to the bill under consideration, for
which, I repeat, I will vote, as lhe least of evils, and continue
tins htate bank agency, whether the deposites are general or
special, uniilthe wisdom andexpenence of the nation shall pro
vi !e a better And heie he would take leave to remark, that
he felt pioud that the < Id Dominion was the land of his birth,
when he saw her representatives stand forth, with manly
firmness regardless of party and the frowns of power, and re
sist measui es of such dangerous tendency, and he begged leave
to assuie them that he was not hostile to State banks—on the
contrary, he believod it was wise for every State to have banks
of solid capital, and under prudent management He was not
disposfd, continued Mr Pope, to impair the strength of the
State Government?, because he held them to be essential pillare
of the temple of Vmencan liberty While he was not prepared
to co the whole length of nullification, his observation of the
course and tendency of this Government for a long period had
convinced him that the strength of the State Governments must
be maintained and that they were the great bulwarks around
which the people must occasionally rally to arrest the anti re-
publiean tendencies to ^ hich the central power is liable in the
hands of wickedness or lollv At the same time that I express
this view, with unfeigned sim erity, I must, contmuedMr Pope,
b permitted to say that the National Government must be al
lowed the full and fair exercise of all the powers assigned toit,
acct ídm^ to a fair interpretation of the Constitution, to enable
it to accot iplish the objects for which it was intended The
pow eis w ere grantwl to Congress to regulate commerce, exter
nal and internal, and to com money and regulate the value
thejeof, in exclusion of State power, and it would be a violation
of the spirit and intent of the Constitution to withhold from
Congress any of the means fairly m-cessary and proper, and
clearly adapted to cairy into eifect the objects of those grants of
powei to which I have inferred An unreasonable distrust oi
jealousy ought not lobemduWd of this Government more than
of othei Governments crea ed by the people, from whom
both State and jSational Gov rnmeuts hal emanated.   Our na
