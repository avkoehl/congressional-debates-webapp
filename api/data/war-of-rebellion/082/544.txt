Brigadier General G. WEITZEL,

Chief of Staff, Dept. of Virginia and North Carolina:

General Hancock advanced his skirmish line below the creek at 6.40 a. m. The enemy opened with three or four guns as his line advanced, and the musketry firing was quite sharp for some little time. All is quiet now, and the enemy appear to have fallen back. I am about to make a demonstration on this side to attract attention.

Respectfully, yours,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier- General.

(Same to General Birney.)
