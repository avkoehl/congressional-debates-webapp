heavy force, or they will drive in our right and get all our trains at Fredericksburg. The enemy's right, I believe, is entrenched all the way to the Po.

Major-General.

WARREN'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 19, 1864-9.15 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Cutler, on my right flank, has just sent in a prisoner from Scales' brigade. He says Hill's corps has moved north from the Court-House across the entrenchments occupied by General Burnside, so that his whole force lies on my right flank. He says, too, that there is another corps on the right of Hill's.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 19, 1864-9.30 p.m.

General WARREN:

Your telegram in reference to Hill's corps received. You say there is another corps on Hill's right. Do you mean Hill's right proper, or his right as we look at him? There seems to be no doubt that Ewell has crossed the Ny or was across this afternoon.

GEO. G. MEADE.

FIFTH CORPS,

May 19, 1864-9.30 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I mean on Hill's own right southward. The man had that impression, but could not say positively.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

FIFTH CORPS,

May 19, 1864-10 p.m.

General MEADE:

General Crawford reports it as his belief from information received from prisoners that Ewell's whole corps crossed the Ny River. One prisoner says he understood their movement was to get at our supplies, as they were nearly starved out. The last issue they has for two days would not more than make a meal for a hungry man. I send you these reports, not that they are necessarily true, but in connection with those you receive from other sources may assist in getting at the truth.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
