THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 18,
The VICE PRESIDENT. The report will
be read.
The Secretary proceeded to road the report of
the committee of conference. After reading it at
some length he was interrupted by
Mr. WILKINSON. I voted against the print-
ing of that report before, and I now wish to make
a motion to reconsider that vote. I think it is abso-
lutely neeessary that that report should be printed,
that we may know what it is. If certain features
are in- that bill which 1 am told are in it, I shall
vote against it; Wut I want to know what the pro-
visions of thp bill are.
,. The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Minnesota moves to reconsider the vote by which
the Senate refused to order the report of the com-
mittee of conference to be printed.
Mr. WILSON. I will state to the Senator that
all the changes in the bill arc contained in two
sections. We have here the printed bill, and the
sections are here with our modifications. We have
modified the section inserted by the House of
Representatives for enrolling and drafting colored
persons, and the Senator will see when we come
to it what that modification is.
The Senate provided that the commutation
money should be $400, and thai the name of the
person paying commutation money should go
back into the box. The House of Representatives
reduced that sum to $300, and required the name
of the drafted person paying commutation to be
added to the list, making htm again liable only
after everybody else had been drafted. That
seemed to be a bounty for the payment of money
and against the obtaining of soldiers. The com-
mittee of conference therefore consented to the
House amendment reducing the sum from $400
to $300, but provided that that should relieve the
person only for one year, instead of providing that
he should go back to the foot of the liyt. We
thought that would put him on an equality with
the man who procures a substitute, for he is not
discharged if his substitute becomes liable.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I do not intend as a Sen-
ator to vote without understanding what 1 vote
for or against on an important measure if I can
help it; and I do not think it is the right of a ma-
jority to ask that of us. While it is not usual
to print reports from committees of conference,
because they geneially relate to but one or two
things and are very simple, relating Jo mere ques-
tions of disagreement between the two bodies,
yet when we have u report so voluminous as this,
reaching to almost every section of the bill, and
when a Senator says to the majority that upon
the reading of the report he is not sufficiently in-
formed to give that vote he desires to give upon
it, it seems to me but a reasonable tiling thatone
day should be given to the printing of the report,
that we may vote knowing what we are voting
for or uguinst. I think the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs can secure the passage
of his bill at an eaiher hour by allowing the re-
port to he printed than by denying it. It is but
a fair thing that is asked, and I think it ought to
be cheerfully conceded.
Mr. CONNESS. The proposition made by
the Senator from Indiana appears fun*on thefaee
ofit; but he can scaicely fail to see that it is not
only unusual but rather out of the line of prece-
dents. Tlie.se conference committees in legisla-
tive bodies are the meansof reconciling constantly
accruing difleienee.s between the two Houses;
and if a demand to print their leports when made
should be acceded to us a matter of courtesy, or
even of right, the Senator can hardly fail to see
how important legislation might be delayed and
finally lost. I have never heaid of such a course
in legislation.
If it were necessary in order that a Sciutor
might understand the points at issue before he
voted upon them, there would be some reason for
asking a change of the course which is not only
initial, but universally followed. Certainly the
measure now under consideration has been suffi-
ciently understood and debated by the press of the
country and in both Houses of Congress until
filmostuvery point of it is comprehended by every
peison in the land. The differences existing be-
tween the two Houses of Congress upon it have
been accommodated by this committee of confer-
ence, and to as!c for delay before a vote can he
tuken on the question of concurring or non-con-
curring scenic to me rather an extraordinary de-
mand. It would be the right ot the Senator,
and very properly, it appears to me, to call for
such a division of the question as to enable the
Senate to vote upon the separate propositions.
Mr. TRUMBULL. That cannot be done.
The report must be taken as a whole.
Mr. CONNESS. Very well. Then it pre-
sents no difficulty to my mind; nor do I see any-
thing in this case that should call for a change
from the precedent that is a necessity in legisla-
tion,and that has been universally followed.
Mr. WILKINSON. Ifit were theclose of the
session the remarks of the Senator from Califor-
nia would be applicable and pertinent.
Mr. GRIMES. It is pretty near-the 1st of
March, though.
Mr. WILKINSON. But I do not see the ne-
cessity of urgingthe Senate to a vote to-day when
this motion, ifit prevails, will not detain the bill
more than a day. It will be printed to-morrow.
It is my opinion, with the feeling manifested by
some gentlemen on this floor, that if this matter
is urged to a vote to-night, no time will be gained
at all; for I do not believe Senators can get a vote
uponit. I think, therefore, it had betterbeprinted.
Mr. WILSON. It seems to me to be an un-
usual thing to print a report of this character,
and I thought and still think it of great import-
ance to get through with this bill to-day. Hut
Senators speak with some earnestness, not to say
feeling in the matter, and I certainly would not
like to adopt an illiberal policy of action here to-
ward anybody. From what has been said, and
the earnest manner in which it has been said, I
suppose wecan hardly hope to getthebill through
much sooner by pressing it than by yielding to
the wishes of Senators. I will yield, therefore, to
allow the report to be printed, with the understand-
ing that we shall have it to-morrow morning, and
shall take the vote upon it then.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is
on reconsidering the vote by which the Senate
refused to order the report to be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question now
is on agreeing to the motion to print the report.
The motion was agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The subject will
therefore be postponed until to-morrow; and the
Senate will return to the consideration of busi-
ness relating to the District of Columbia.
rUBLIC SCHOOLS IN DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
On motion of Mr. GRIMES, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill (S. No. 26) to provide for the*public in-
struction of youth in primary schools throughout
the county of Washington, in the Distiictof Co-
lumbia, without the limits of the cities of Wash-
ington and Georgetown.
Mr. GRIMES. Without reading the original
bill, I suggest that the Senate proceed to consider
the amendment reported from the Committee on
the Dusti ict of Columbia.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Foster
in the chair.) Unless some Senator calls for the
muling of the original bill the amendment re-
ported by the committee in lieu of the oiigtnal bill
will be lead.
