whether you intend me to move my whole command across the Ta River or stop to-night in front of Catlett's. I will have time to get an answer from you before I can get my troops in hand on this side.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your disptach received. It was not intended that you should move your whole command across the Ta River, but that you should move it beyond Catlett's on the left-hand road, and send a sufficient force across the Ta at the bridge to hold it.

Let us have anything that transpires. Michler was sent on road from Catlett's to blacksmith shop on Telegraph road crossing the Po; not heard from yet.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 21, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have sent General Griffin, who is just arriving, to camp on the road you designated to the Ta River about one-third of a mile beyond the forks of the road. General Crawford holds out on the right fork 1 1\2 miles, and near him are the vedettes of the enemy's cavalry. I sent my escort out till they ran against them. I sent some cavalry to picket the bridge below, and the rest, followed by Kitching's brigade, I have sent to the crossing of the Ta, about 2 3\4 miles from here. I have not yet heard the result. Major Roebling is with the party. I saw Mrs. Schooler, whose husband is a captain in Lee's army, and she was utterly surprised at our appearance here. General Crawford sends me the following; "From information I have received, the enemy are intrenched at Stanard's Mill on the road turning to the right at the Mud Tavern, about 3 miles from here." I will send you word again as soon as I hear from Kitching. I shall not be able to communicate with General Burnside to-night.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
