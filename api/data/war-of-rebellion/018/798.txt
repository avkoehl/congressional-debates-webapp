Within an hour all the commands on the other roads will be in camp within the intrenchments; the three corps on the Vienna and Chain Bridge road by to-morrow morning.

I await your orders. The enemy still continues to beat around on the north. I do not myself believe that any attack here is contemplated. The troops are very weary, but otherwise in good condition.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 2, 1862.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe, Va.:

The great danger to Washington renders it necessary that the remainder of General Keyes' corps be sent here as rapidly as possible-at least all of it that you can spare. The entire army of the enemy is before us, and the fighting has been daily for a week, with varying results.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

ALEXANDRIA, VA., September 2, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Thousands of stragglers, singly and in squads, are coming to this vicinity. Most all of the officers show authority from general officers, or are manifestly sick. Many of the men claim to be guards after they are collected. Can I have one of the forts in this vicinity in which to confine and reorganize them? If so, which?

JOHN P. SLOUGH,

Brigadier-General Volunteers, &amp;c.

FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE,

September 2, 1862-10 a.m.

General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN, Washington:

You may rest assured that all your friends, as well as every lover of his country, will ever give, as they have given, to General Pope their cordial co-operation and constant support in the execution of all orders and plans. Our killed, wounded, and enfeebled troops attest our devoted duty.

F. J. PORTER,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, September 2, 1862.

General SLOUGH, Alexandria, Va.:

Take temporarily any fort convenient and refer the matter afterward to General McClellan.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
