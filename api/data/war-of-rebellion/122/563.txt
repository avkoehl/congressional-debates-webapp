October 5, 1861.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Yours of the 9th, 16th, 18th, 23rd, 26th, 27th, and 30th ultimo, covering applications made by Lord Lyons for the discharge of certain British subjects from the Army of the United States, has been duly received, and I regret that it is not in my power to accede to His Lordship's request. The numerous applications for discharges daily pouring in from various quarters, and which multiply with the encouragement given by every fresh discharge, have compelled me at length to deny all. Were it not for that rule, which I do not feel at liberty to alter, I should have taken great pleasure in ordering those asked for by His Lordship.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

BOSTON, October 5, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

Will you pay our soldiers as fast as sworn in half-month's pay, detailing paymasters therefor? Do not authorize this for any unless for all. What is General Butler's power and position here?

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor.

Washington City, October 5, 1861.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston, Mass.:

We cannot pay in advance. General Butler has authority to concentrate a brigade for special service, all of which is to be organized under the several Governors of the Eastern States. We gave General Butler authority with regard to advance.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
