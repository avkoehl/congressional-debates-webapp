if every man's individail opinion was to bs asked,
there ivould be no tnd u ti e debate
Mr WISE did not intend to do m'sch ef by ask-
ing the question. If the independence of Hayti
was to be recognise!, he would have no objection
{0 the gentleman iiom Massachusetts bemg sent
as Minister to that conntiy, bnh" would not like
to see duashi Pompey sent here. However, it
was a matter of taste.
Mr W read from his'ory to show how the in-
habitants of the Eastern Sta es, in forme"- da>s,
'reaped the nFgroes Tney even ensl ved the abo
ngmesof the soil, and sold them into the West In-
dies It wa-, now meet for Massachusetts ?nd
Rhode Is-'and to perform «ome ^ct of penprce be-
fore God for wrung? doie to Gum=a and 'he lu-

Mr W. referred to the co jr>e of someof his friends,
who voted for the exclusion of tne 21st ru'e, so
lhai the me-nonals ol the Abolitionists might be
received—blinking ihat <=uch procedure wouid al-
lay exeiteineu' He iaid that pen ions on ¡hit
subject had b«en rece ved f*.r more tbin forty
vears, ard that Jamrs Madron, th° fatber of the
Constitution, once ma-^e a vepnrt upon th' <-ub
ject, but the a?uat on did not cease, ^s was hown

No, said Mr W. the evil can never be rem -

petitiors, or it would hace b"eu done before thi^
I havi h-a^d of the our pg of the bi'e of a mad do 
by applying the hair of the dog to the wound, but I
«ever before bear i of caring agitation by agita-
tion
Mr Wist then cited a ereat runiber of cases
from the journal, to how that the Abolition mem-
bers 'u the House were not, pud never had be-o,
con'ent with the reception of petitions Resolutions
had, on varu us o-casions, be^n ofitred, admitting
the right of reception, b 1  yet motions 10 lay such
petiaors on the tal ie after'heir r cption, had bepn

After referring at some length to the c rcum-
Mances under which resolutions in rela ion to
Abolitionism had been broiiíh* in from time to
time, and voted down, Mr W said "And thus,
with all the.e facts b«fore u^, we are 'old, 'thete
are Hot six Abohticists in the House ' "
As a futther proof that the Abolitionists v.anted
more th=n the mere right of petition, Mr Wisf
read from the j urral to «how that, dti mg d" ast

h^ (Mr W ) said he was a orished that th- gea
tlemjiti from Massachu et s coold now iaee him in
the House, more especially after the gentleman had
made an apology fot his conduct on that occasion.
Mr. ADAMS.   I made no apology.
Mr. WISE Yes, but the gentleman djd make
an apology    Indeed, it was more than an apolosv
Mr. ADAMS Well then, if it was more than
an apology, it was not an apology
Mr. WISE then gave the result of a re olotion
finally offered on that occasion, and, after renew-
ing th  who'ematter, said ítmade his soul bum
thro igh hi  ribs 0 think of it.
Mr WISE then appealed to his friends of the
Siuih on the imperative neces i'y of restating to
the utn ost every attempt at innovation on their
rights He referred to the career of Wilbertorce
o 1 the slave trade, and aho to the Catholic Eman-
cipation act, to'how the danger of a majority re-
ma rung inactive, ard only opposing a dead inertia,
while a minority, however small, were constantly
exei ng themselves, and kepn  up agitation,
> car a f ter year, before the publ c mmd In such a
s ate of thing  the minority wee rure to ?am th-ir
point, as certainly as that the solid marble *ou d
vicar a>vay by the constant ruaning of the stream.
A 6 o'clock, after speaking as many hours, Mr.
Wise concUu'el
Messrs RAYNER and BOTT3 simultaneously
claimed the floor, but the Chair awarded it to the
latter
Mr BOTTS then moved the previous question
Mr. STANLY moved a call ot the How, which
was ordered, and proceeded wi h until 204 m-m-
bers ansvvered to their names All further pro-
ceedings were then dispen*ed with.
The previous question was then seconded, put
ana carried, and the mam question ordered to be put.
|     And tne mam question  being, "Shall the vote
he reconsidered"!" was then taken, and decided
in t e affirmant e, a  follows
