THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May I,
the old fogies of ages past, though yet living,
would continue if they be permitted to control
the legislation of the country.
Let us avoid the errors of the past. Let us
"in peace prepare for war." If war should
come, and it may be not far_ distant, you
will then say, "What a pity it is that we did
not build the Niagara ship-canal when we were
at peace." Then it will be loo late; now ia
the lime for action.
Now, sir, with regard to the commercial
importance of this measure to the country,
East and West, no language is adequate to
do the subject justice. Why, sir, it is esti-
mated that by this great work the cost of trans-
portation on every bushel of grain_ will be
reduced ten cents at least from Chicago to
New York and Boston. Consequently, it will
be ten cents increase to the producer and ton
cents reduction to the purchaser. Suppose,
then, we transport one hundred million bush-
els of grain per annum, which, in a few years,
will be but half the actual amount transported
from the Northwest. .There you have $10,-
000,000 saved to the producer, and $10,000,000
saved to the consumer. As the honorable gen-
tleman from Connecticut [Mr. Brandegee]^
remarked, "the effect will be to make a loaf of
bread in Connecticut twice as large and cost
but half as much as at present," not that the
hundred million bushels will all go through
this canal; but the construction of this work
will have the effect to reduce freight, on rail-
roads and other lines of transportation to that
extent if not more. By this means we shall
enhance the value of western and eastern
industry more than twenty million dollars per
annum, a sum exceeding more than three times
the amount proposed to bo loaned by this bill,
in the shape of Government bondsj for the
building of this great national work.
Sir, 1 have here statistical tables showing
the immense advantages of this work, espe-
cially (o the agricultural interest of the West
and to the whole country generally. Why,
sir, Illinois, during the last year, notwithstand-
ing she furnished a quarter of a million men
for the Army for the preservation of the Re-
public, raised one hundred and seventy-seven
million bushels of corn. That noble State
raises one fourth of the entire corn product of
the United States, one fifth of the wheat, and
one seventh ot the oats, and sends to the New
York market more beef cattle than all the other
States together.
But I will draw no invidious CQmpavisons
between Illinois and the other northwestern
Slates, in proportion to their population and
arable lands they do equally as well.
1 will now give the Ilousc some statistics
which will be instructive in estimating the
importance of this work, and which will be
of interest to the whole country. I read now
from the report of Hon. W. J. McAlpine, late
State engineer of,.the State of New York, in
his report to the Legislature of that State in
theyear 1855. Theseare coneededtobereliable

In 1860 the whole number of acres of improved land
in ail the States and Territories was 163,261,389
Of this— .
Missouri contained  6,246,871
Illinois 
Iowa —  3./80.253
Wisconsin 
Minnesota  554,397
  27,579,030
Or a fraction less than one sixth.
The total value of crops for 1864 is estimated by
the Agricultural Bureau of the Department of the
Interior to have been « $1,564,543,690
Of this sum-
Illinois produced $214,488,426
Wisconsin  61,93$,852
Missouri  52,996,592
Jowa  71,100,481
Minnesota  13,168,123
  403,692,474
Ormorethan one fourth of the value of the enrire
crops of the country. But these estimates of value
are the estimated value of the various products in the
States wheie produced. In this way the value of
articles in the above States appears to a great disad-
vantage, because being so far from market, they are
rated much loss than the same articles in other States,
especially those near the sea-board. The sameis true
of the estimated value of the live stock, which, on
the 1st of January, 1865, was $990,879,128
Of this—
Illinois had $116,588,288
M isso uri  44,431,766
Iowa  66,572,496
Wisconsin  36,911,165
Minnesota    8,860,015
  273,363,730
Or morethanonefourth. A juster standard by which
to measure the productiveness of these States would
be a comparison of the amount of their respective
products, smco the value is so largely affected by the
distance from maiket.
"The great .staples of agriculture are wheat, corn,
beef, and polk. Comparing these, we find that the
total number of bushels of wheatproduced in all the
States and Territories in 1864 (except the cotton
States, whose production was almost nominal, prob-
ably not more than one sixth of what it was in 1860)
was 160,695,823
Illinois produced 33,371,173
Missouri..   3,281,514
Wisconsin 14,168,317
Iowa .12,649,807
Minnesota  2,634,975
  66,105,786
Or a fraction less than one half.
The total number of bushels of corn produced
was 530,451,403
Illinois produced 138,356,135
Missouri  36,63^.011
Wisconsin  10,087.053
Iowa  55,261,240
Minnesota  4,647,329
  244,986,768
Or nearly one half.
The whole number of cattle and oxen, January 1,
1865, was 7,072,591
Illinois had.....' 978,700
Missouri 471,006
Wisconsin 388,760
Iowa 561,338
Minnesota 127,175
  2,526,979
Or more than one third.
The total number of hogs was  13,070,887
Illinois had 2,034,231
Missouri  98S.S57
Wisconsin  340,638
Iowa 1,423,567
Minnesota  109,016
  4,896,506
Or more than one third.
The entire population of the United States in 1860
was  31,443,322
Illinois contained 1,711,951
Iowa  674,913
Missouri 1,182,012
Minnesota       172,123
Wisconsin    775,881
-  4,516,880
Or about one seventh.
" Thus it will be seen that these five States, possess-
ing only one seventh of all the population and one
sixth of all the improved land, nevertheless in 1864
produced more than one fourth in value of the en-
I tire crop, more than ono fourth in value of all the
live stock, more than one third in number of all the
cattle and hogs, and nearly one half of all the wheat
and corn grown in the United States. Here we find
four and one half millions of agriculturists along the
upper Mississippi producing in a single year from
one third to one half of all the production of the
leading staples of an estimated value of $677,056,2U4.
"In the fiscal years 1861, 1862, and 1S63, the Uni-
ted States exported 89,941,508 bushels of wheat and
6,997.470 barrels of flour, valued at $148,673,907. Dur-
ing those same years we shipped from the lake ports
named 85,577,516 bushels of wheat and 7,530,893 bar-
rels of flour. Reduce the flour to bushels and we
have as the entire exports of wheat from the United
States for the three years, 124,828,902 bushels. Ship-
ments from the lake ports named for the three years,
123,231,981 bushels. .
" The contributions, therefore, made by Illinois,
Wisconsin, Missouri, and Minnesota, to the exports of
the United States in these three leading agricultural
staples alone, are as follows:
1860-61. 1861-62. 1862-63.
Wheat $48,938,780 $44,187,148 155,647,979
Corn and meal  6,387,160 9,609,879 9,623,357
Pork products  4,685,784 10,217,281 16,424,338
Total $60,013,724 $64,017,308 $81,695,674
"Excluding gold, silver, and bullion, -which aro
hardly analogous to other products, and^ the entire
exports of domestic products of the United States
amounted in 1860-61 to $217,666,953: in 1861-62 to
$190,699,387; and in 1862-63 to $260,666,110.
"The average exports of the country for the three
years was $222,874,183 33, and the averagB exports
which these five States contributed in wheat, corn,
and pork alone, was $68,575,568 66, or very nearly one
third."
Thus it will be seen what the West has done
in her giant strides within the past few years,
and he who is possessed of a brilliant, volatile
imagination may have some conception of what
the capacity, the power, and the glory of this
country will be a quarter of a century hence.
We are apt to think too much of the present
and not enough of the future. We legislate
too much for the present and not enough with
reference to the future. The wisest and most
far-seeing man of twenty-five years ago did not
even dream of the realities of the present day;
and then shall this country a quarter of a cen-
tury hence say the same of us with reference
to our present legislation? Let us try to com-
prehend the vast resources of the country and
the power of its people under favorable cir-
cumstances, to build up a republic which shall
be the controlling Power of the world in an
agricultural, manufacturing, and mechanical
point of view. We have the richest lands and
the richest mines, the mightiest rivers and the
greatest lakes on the face of the earth, and if
we but make a proper use of the mighty and
inexhaustible means in our hands, we will be one
day, and that not far distant, the greatest,
wealthiest, most intelligent, and happiest peo-
ple that ever existed.
Now, the State of Illinois alone numbers
2,250,000 people, and the group of States
known as the northwestern States more than
10,000,000 people. Forty years ago they all
did not contain more than 1,000,000 souls.
Then Chicago was known as an Indian trading
post; now it contains a population of nearly a
quarter of a million, and is the greatest grain,
lumber, and pork market on the globe. Why,
sir, since that day a republican empire has
sprung into existence, which contains within
itself more elements of strength and greatness
than any empire in the Old World, with per-
haps the single exception of the Russian
empire. We have already astonished the
world, and if we continue to increase in the
present ratio of prosperity, we will not only
astonish but amaze the world. Who can
with certainty predict the future greatness and
glory of the Bepublic, when it is ascertained
with mathematical accuracy that according to
the present ratio of increase of the population
of the United States, in 1870 we will number
42,000,000 people; in 1880, 56,000,000; in
1890, 77,000,000; and in theyear 1900, 100,-
000,000.
Sir, if the country is not cramped by the
beggarly parsimony of narrow-minded and
short-sighted men, it is safe to assume that the
increase of her agricultural and mechanical
products will increase in the same ratio as her
population. How totally inadequate, then, will
