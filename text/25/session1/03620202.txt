ment, and then go home, and think no more about
a bank we foi bid it The President of the United
States has told you beforehand in his message, that
in reference toanationalbank, ordinarily so called,
his mind is made up, and the Congress of the Uni-
ted States, in both branches tell you, before the
measure is proposed, that they have made up their
mmds, that it is vain to think of it, thai it is vam
to ask for it, nay, although you come to us, and, as
with a pencil of light, sketch out a vision by which
we can see with certainty, that the same means
which m 1816 and 1817 dispelled clouds as dark as
they are now, and longer gathering, promises the
same results, jet they cannot be heaid, that yon
have nothing to do w ith the curiency, that it is their
busmess, and not vours, that they must go to their
homes, and not indulge themselves in luxuries
Sir, it appears to me very inexpedient thus to act
[On the following morning Mr Sfrgeikt moved
that the resolution should be i efened to a Commit-
tee of the Whole on the state of the Union, for the
purpose of more ample and satisfactory debate
This was opposed, and, after ^ome discussion, the
previous question yias ordered, vv hich put an end
to the discussion ]
SPEECH OF MR. GARLAND,
Op Virginia,
In the House of Hep cscntahves, Seplcmbct 25,1837—
In opposition to the bill " imposing additional du-
ties, as depositories in ecitam cases, on public
officeis"
Mr Chairkuv I am indebted to the kindness of
thegentleman from Tennessee (Mi Williams) who
was entitled to the floor, foi the privilege of ad-
dressing the committee a* this hour Thispuyi-
!ege accorded by that gentleman and the house
under existing encumstances yvdl command my
lasting gratitude
After three yeais oi more of seeming unpaiallel-
ed prosperity, the nation has been ovct taken by an
adversity which has paral) /< d its i ncigy and píos
trated all its biancho oi industry and cnteipiise
So vivid, and so real yyete the ippeai.ances tint the
late President of the United State   in his fareyy ell
addressto the American people felicitated the court
try, and himself, upon its unparalleled piospenty
and happiness, yet its most important mtei csts, as it
this apparent prosperity weie but a delusion, now
he prostrate, and bleed at every pore    Ii has yvith
ered like the beautiful and veutantfloweisof spnng,
by the untimely  nip ot a prematme frost     The
blighting effects of this unlookcd foi adyersity upon
the agricultute,  roinmc rce, and nav igalion of the
countij, and the obs'aclcs which it obtrudes *o the
pcfuniary opeiattonsof the Goy eminent has  ndtic
ed the President oí the United States mdtsrhaige
of his high constitutional duties to call together, at
this unptopttiotis season, the lepiescntalnes of the
States and the people, «ih i view of applying as
fu as legislation can doit a remedy Í >r the existing
diseases of the country     It. hmi ic I will íemar' ,
that legislation cannot afford hat substantial peima
nent relief which the distres es and embaí rassments
of the countrv reqm e   that, can only  be found in
the industry, economy and elastic eneigy of the peo
pie, yvhich licietofoie upon like try ing t ccasions has
so effectually availed    Wise and judicious legisla-
tion may do much to mi igate the severity of the
present calamity and hasten the peuod oí relief but
it cannot of itself be eff.cnve, it must bt am ihary
—it cannot be prunai y
Before I proceed to discuss the met its of thp pr --
cipal remedy proposeil by the Picsident, foi the re
lief of the Gi eminent and the raintii   I ask the
indulgence of the hou e   m making reference to
the circumstances ith ch place m   in reference to
that remedy, in a peculiar attitude—for no othei
consideration could induce me to obti ide upon the

scheme embracing the vety   piin-iplcs of the re-
commendations of the message    The principles of
the bill, pioposedby my predecessor m Februaiy,
1835 yvas opposed and denounced by the late ad-
ministration, and all us prominent friends in both
houses of Congress, in no unmeasured terms In
this denunciation and opposition, I united, and de-
fended General Jackson's admmistiation tor its op-
position to this scheme before the people of the Con
gre-.sional district,yy inch I now feel honoied in rep-
resenting Now, Mr Chairman, in less than three
years, I find my self c mpelled to defend the opinions
I tnen entertained and defended, not against my po-
litical opponents, but against the at acks of the pre-
sent a Imimstration and its friends so eomple ely
hay e they changed their position Finding for a ieyv
months past, thatmy opinions upon this suoject w ere
m collision with those of the administration and
most oí its piomment friends, I carefullv and dehb-
ciately revieyyed my former opinions, yyith a vieyy
to detect any fallarv, error, oi delusion,underyyhich
I labored, if there yy as any yy Inch had contubuted to
foim those opinions The result of this revieyv has
been to rr et my conviction of the truth of those
opinions and an mci eased and more infle tibie de-
teimmation to adhere to them Being satisfied that
my opinions are correct, 1 darenot—I cannot—I yvill
not yrote for this recommendation of the message
This determination to resist the recommendation
of the President's message upon this subject, and as
it may be called, my obstinate persev el anee in mam
taming my o\yn honest and sinceie opinions in the
late e'ection of printer to this house, has brought
upon me individually and in connexion with many
of my political friends yvhose opinions and couise
hay e been in accordance yvith mj oyy n severe and
bittei denunciations from some presses professing
demoeiatic republicanism, m which yyehaye been
charged yvith timtmism to our party, and humble I,
haye been dignified as the head of a partv Gocl
knoyvs, Mr Chairman, I neyer desired or diearned
of being apa/ttj leader, I haye not upon this or
upon any other occasion, smcelhave had the honoi
of a seat on this flooi, attempted to lead or control
the opinions of others, nor have I had any concern
yvith anv party arrangements as ey ei ymember yy ith
whom I heietof re acted, oi with yybom I now act,
yycll knoyys Why then have I been so dignified'!
As to the chatge of traitorism, I shall onlvsay, that
I have not descited my political paitv, but, upon
this qucstit n, it has deseileel ifjcZ/as well as me I
have no moie to say now, or shall I at anytime
hereafter refer to these editorial attacks—I leave
them to rey el m the glory of their achievements
ovei the feelings of honorable men, as the Turks
revelled amidst the rums of bleeding and burning
Missalonghi It is to be regretted that the selections
of our law givers are not confined to the editorial
corps yvho, from their course of remark, leay e it to
be mfeited that they regaid themselves as haT ing
nunc u i\dow, mo c n formation, and mo?e palt lolism,
than ey cry othei class of citizens and, above all,
tint they possess the power of infallible scrutiny
into the heaits and motives of others, which enables
Ihem, unen mgly to expose the secret springs of
ei ery man's action
In discussing the recommendation of the message
pnsented in the foim of ¡aw by the Committee of
Way s and Means, embracing the yyhole principle
of the message, I shall not detain the committee by
enteung mtoa discussion of the comparaiiv e merits
of a national bank and Slate banks, or the expedí
ency of establish ing a national bank There is now
no proposition fo> the incorporation of a national
bank hpfo'c the House nor is it deigned so fai as
lam iifonned to present one dunng the piesent
sess on If such apio osition w eie presented ard
and anil onal bank were incorporated it coul I not
he oi san z"d and put into opeiation in time to aflfird
any ifhef to the present embarrassments of the
countty ,ev en if it would have thateftert, which I by
no means admit Themcorporat on of such an m
ti it'ioii with 'ueh a ledundancy of bank capital
an 1 bank eiiemation, would in niel easing the cle-
lrnndnpon the exis ngl anks for sneeic and diven
in" it tiom the emi'sp of Iradp do more to continue
the presen1" embnnassments of the country than all
other causes combined In tl is s ate of things tne
question to ce decide ! is whether the con muanee
of the piesent State bank sjstem of fiscal agency
withtre mprevemen sandrc-tnetionswh chexnen
ence has pointed out as necessaivand piopei, or the
' "in'n d etrpeivnii-nl' of excluding the State banks
as depositoiies of tl e public money and restnc mg
the receipts of tne public revenae to gold and nlmi
onhi shall be adopted This is the true issue to
the decision of yyhichas affects the future happiness
and prospenty of the nation, the most serious and
deliberate attention of the house should be directed
1 need not here repeat what I haye befoie stated,
thatvvnenever ihe question of a national bank is pre-
sented, if I shall have the honor of a seat upon this
floor, that I shall oppose it, both upon the grounds
of the want of constitutional power, and its inexpe
diency The opinions I imbibed in my earliest
youth, I learned from the State papers of Jeffeison,
Madison, and their republican cotemporaries, and
shall never surrender them until I become a tenant
of the tomb
Although the recommendation of the President s
message, and the proyisions of the bill from the
Committee of Ways embraces, in its immediate
scope, an exclusive metalic cunency, foi the oper-
ations of the Federal Government alone, yet it is
manifest that in its operation it muso come m colli
sion with the " credit system," and yy age a yvar of
extermination against it, in every form and shape,
asa medium of en dilation , with yvhat prospect
of success it is not foi me to undertake to deter-
mine This ptescnts to the American people a
question of momentous importance In modern
times banking institutions have been adopted as the
most safe and efficient agencies of credit, bj all the
most enlightened and meist commeicial nations of
the world They had their ongm in Venice, in
the days of her commeicial prosperity, and have
been successfully adopteel by all commercial na-
tions, particulaily m England, and France Early
m the history of our own Government, they weie
adopted, and have glow n with our growth, strength-
ened yvith our strength, and have been enlarged
fiom time to time to meet the exigencies ol our
increased and yvidely extended commerce, until
they have become so intimately interwoven with
our commerce and connected with our local institu-
tions, as to make the reparation difficult and danger-
ous m the extreme This scheme however pre-
sents the question, and it must be ultimately met
and decided In the conflict, this exclusive metallic
system proposed for the Goy ernment must be aban-
doned, or all our banking institutions perish, there
is no middle gionnel
Let it be remembered, mat, unler the vivifying
influence and salutaiy operations of our banking
institutions, our country has flourished and prosper-
ed, beyond parallel, in the history of nations When
yy c corapaie our condition, at the close of the revo-
lution, with what it is at the present day, yve per
ceive that in population, agriculture, commerce,
and manufactures, our improy ement has been rapid
uey ond precedent Our villages, our towns, and
our systems of internal improvement, flourishing
and improving bey ond example, b°speak an in-
crease of wealth, power, and commercial facilities,
yvhich yvould not exist w ithout the healthful action
of a sound system of ciedit The seciet of the sys-
tem is, that by its opei ation, it throyvs into activccir-
cnlation,moie than thiee times the amount of actual
capital, and thereby supplies trade and commerce
with the means of sue essful opeiation in the ab
sence of an adequate supply of the metallic medi-
um It is true that these institutions, like others,
constructed and managed by frail human agency,
have been mismanaged and abus=d There is no
perfection in human nature and nothing perfect
can be produced at its hands What estimate would
be plated upon the intelligence of the man who,
because the boiler of the capacious and majestic
steamboat sometimes bursts, yvould lecommend the
dfstiuction of the steamboat, and the re adoption
of the eanop nayigation i Your Government,
yvhich my much esteemed fiipnd from Viigmia,
(Mr Tones ) sajs is an experiment, has sometimes
been abused What estimate w ould you place
upon the intelligence of the man yvho, fot this
cjuss, yy ould recommend the entire destruction of
our system as the proper remedy i Som reference
to the banking sjsrem, would it not be yviser to
collect and cut off the abuses, ?nd preserve the
system than rashly and inconsiderately destroy
if If the question weie now picscnted as an
original one, yy hethei we «ho i'd adopt the banking
system perhaps mv own mmd would be led to the
adoption of a system organized upon a qui p differ-
ent plan, but yye have the system and the question
is, how we shall act m reference to it t There is
no man who really thinks that tliete is theshghtest
piosrect tl at this sjstem will or can be eiadica'cd
foi a length of time, if evei , hence yve must ac-
commodate our action as far as yy e can, to the state
of things as they are, and seek rathei to aid and
assist the State Governments m correcting the
abuses of the banks, and restore them to .health
