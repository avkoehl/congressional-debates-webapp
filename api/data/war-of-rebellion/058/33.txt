SECRETARY OF WAR:

On 23rd December Major-General Foster ordered all the organized troops in Kentucky to be sent at once to Knoxville. This will take the forces organized under act of Congress for defense of Kentucky, and leave the State exposed to ruin by guerrillas. I wish to know if this order is to be enforced. Answer.
