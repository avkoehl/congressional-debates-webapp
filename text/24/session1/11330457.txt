me to say (continued Mr B ) that he has not at
a'l met tlic point of mv argument He has m-

ance and responsibility thin it deservts, he has
p'a\td ¡irmnd it with \U his powers, but without
touching tht real question involved in the dis-
cussion
Congress has no power, says the gentleman,
to pass anj Uw abridging the tieedom of speech
or of the pre ;. Granud lit most frt eh admit-
ted tint Congrí ss had no pow er to touch the press
at all We can pass no hw w hatever either to
prevent or to punish any publication, undti
any c iiimstanets whatever The sedition 1 iw
vitiated th s. principle It punished libels against
the Federal Gi\einment mid its officers, and,
having nut with gt neril reprobation, it was íe
pi ah J or permuted to expire by its own limita-
tion, he did not recollect which
Mr R said he admitted thtse premises of the
gentleman in their broidest extent, but did they
justify his conclusions> In order to maintain his
nrgi'imnt, he must prove that the Constitution,
in d< i 'arms: that Congress shall not pass any law
atiridgi  g the trrtdom of the press, has thereby,
mid from the force of these terms alone, com-
manded us to circulite and distribute, through
our post offices, e\erythmg which the piess may
publish, no matter whether it shall promote insur-
rection and civil war or not This is the propo-
sition which he must establish All the gentle-
man's remarks in favor of the liberty of the press
met his cordial approbation, but they did not
apply to the consti utional question then under
discussion He had argued this question pre-
cisely as if, in addition to the words already in
the Constitution, that " Congress shall make no
Jaw abridging the freedom of speech or of the
press," tnere had been inserted, "or to prevent
the circulition of any production of the press
through the post offices " But these words wtie
not in the instrument, indthe only question was,
■whether the one prohibition could be inferred
from the other Mr B said he was in favor of
a plain and literal construction of the Constitu-
tion He took it for his guide, and he could
never consent to interpolate whit its framers
never intended should be there. They have con-
¡erred upon Congress, in express terms, a general
discretion in regard to the Post Office Department,
and the question then was, shall we exercise it
in the manner proposed by this bill, for the pur-
pose of preventing servile war, bloodshed, and
disunion'
How had the gentleman from Massachusetts
met his argumentJ He says that the principles
upon which the Senator from South Caro'ina
[Mr C\LHors] and himself had sustained this
bill, were at variance with each other, and that
this of itself was sufficient to cast doubt over the
measure But was it the first time the gentleman
had ever known correct conclusions to be drawn
from varying or ev en unfounded premises > The
bill itst lfcought not to be condemned for the argu-
ments of its fnends He would remind the gen-
tleman of the advice given by a distinguished
English judge, to a y oung friend about to occupy
ajudicial station in the West Indies, which was,
never to give reasons for his judgments, wheie it
could be avoided, because his natural sense and
perception of justice would almost always enable
him to decide correctly, though he might, and
probably often would, assign insufficient reasons
for his decisions This bill ought to be judged
by its own provisions, and ought not to be con-
demned for the reasons in support of it which had
been advanced either by the Senator from South
Carolina or himself.
The Senator from Massachusetts had argued as
though he (Mr B ) had said, that as the end pro-
posed* by this measure was good, he should vote
tor it, notwithstanding the means might be un-
constitutional
Mr WEBSTER explained, and said he had
not imputed to Mr B such an argument
Mr BUCHANAN sa'd, the Senator did not
mean this imputation, but his argument seemed
to invply as much However necessary he might
believe this bil' to be, if he did not find a clear
warrant for us pas-age in the Constitution, it
should never have his support He never could
believe that this Government, having the exclu-
sive control o\er the Post Office Department in
all Us vauous relations, was yet so impotent to I
prevent e\il that it must, under the fundamental
law which called it into existence, whether it
would or not, distribute publications tending
directly to promote servile insuriection, and to
produce its own destruction
The Senator fiom South Carolina [Mr. Cal-
iiot \] had misappichended him in one particular
He, (Mr B ) had disci umed all authority to pass
this bill denved from Stue laws, or fiom any
other souice than the Constitution of the United
States He had not said he would vote foi a
similxi bill in all casts wh it the State Legisla-
Uues might think proper to pass laws to prohibit
the circulation of any publication whatever. He
considered the passage of such laws merely as
evidence of the necessity for legislation by Con
giess, but he was veiy far'from adopting the
principle that it should be conclusive evidence in
all cases Congress must judge for itself under
all the circumstances of each paitieular case
In reply to the Senator from Massachusetts,
Mi B said that this bill would not be a penal
law Everything like a penalty had been stricken
fiom its provisions, unless the removal of a deputy
postnu&ter fi om office by the Postmaster Ge neral
might be viewed in that light By it we merely
directed our agent not to violate State laws by
distributing publications calculated to excite in-
surrection He would not have occasion to study
all the laws of all the States on the subject of
slavery, as the Senator from Massachusetts had
alleged All that would be required of him was
to know the laws of the State of which he was a
citizen, and to take care not to violate them
The gentleman had said that he (Mr B ) had
mistaken the recommendation contained in the
President's message. Nowheundertook to assert
that this bill was in conformity with the recom-
mendation of the President, and carried it out in
all essential particulars [Here Mr. B again
read the last paragraph of the message, which he
had before read ] Now, sir, (said Mr. B ,) does
not the President expressly assert that Congress
has authority to regulate what shall be distributed
through the post offices, and does he not " sug-
' gest the propriety of passing such a law as will
' prohibit, under severe penalties, the circulation
' in the southern States, through the mail, of
« incendiary publications, intended to instigate
'the slaves to insurrection'" Except that this
bill contained no severe penalties, it was framed,
both in its spirit and in its letter, according to
the suggestion of the President. What other
bill could we pass of a milder character than the
one now before us, to prevent the circulation of
these jncendiary publications ' Let the Presi-
dent's recommendation be entitled to what weight
it might, this bill was in exact accordance with
it
The Senator from Massachusetts had contended
that this bill conferred upon deputy postmasters
the power of depriving individuals of their prop-
erty in newspapers and other publications, in
violation of that clause in the Constitution which
declares that no person shall be deprived of his
property without due process of law. By this
bill we had not attempted to shield any postmaster
from legal responsibility for his conduct We
could not do so, if we would. We had merely
prescribed for him, as we had done for our other
agents, the line of his duty. We did not attempt
to protect him from the suit of any person who
I might consider himself aggrieved. If any indi-
vidual to whom a publication was directed, and
who had demanded it from the postmaster and
I   had been refused, should believe our law to be
unconstitutional, he might bring this question
before the judiciary, and try it, like any other
question All our officers and agents are liable
to be sued, and if the law under which they acted
should prove to be unconstitutional, it would
afford them no protection.   On the present occa-
| sion, we proposed to proceed in the spirit of the
common law principle, that any individual may
| abate a nuisance, though he thereby rendered
himself responsible, in case it should appear after-
wards, that the thing abated was not a nuisance.
So  here, the postmaster refusing  to deliver a
|i newspaper, under our law, would be responsible
II  in damages to the party aggrieved, in case it
should appear that the law under which he had
acted was unconstitutional
As to the necessity for passing this bill, he
should say but a few words It was very easy for
gentlemen to say that necessity was the plea of
tyrants He admitted it had been so, and would
be so in all time to come But after all, if we
possessed the power to legislate in this case, from
our situation we w ere compelled to judge whether
it was necessaiy to call it into efficient action or
not This duty devolved upon us We could
not avoid deciding this question Was it not,
then, within our own knowledge that the slave-
holding States had been attempted to be flooded
with p unphlcts and pictorial representations cal-
culated to excite servile insurrection > Had we
not seen upon this floor many of these pictorial
representations, whose direct effect would be to
excite the wild and brutal passions of the slaves
to cut the throats of their masters' Within the
last few months, had there not been blood shed'
and had there not been several attempted insur-
rections in some of the southern States ' These
facts were incontestable. Believing and knowing
all this to be true, he said the case of necessity, in
hisjudgment, was fully established, and he should
vote for the passage of the bill
Mr CUTHBERT was not desirous to throw
himself into the currentof this debate at this time.
The position which he held—the infrequency of
his occupying that floor, and the indisposition
under which he labored, authorized him to expect
the attention of the Senate for a short time, when
he should be better able to address them than he
then was He therefore hoped the Senate would
indulge him in an opportunity of being heard on
the subject, by postponing it, to be taken up
within a very short period It appeared to him
that the Senator from Pennsylvania had said pre-
cisely what should have been said in support of
this bill It appeared to him that that Senator
had given an unanswerable reply to the Senator
from Massachusetts on points on which he prin-
cipally relied for his opposition to the measure
before them What (said Mr C ) is the state of
the case > The deputy postmaster in one of the
States holds in his hand an mcendiaiy publica-
tion, intended to carry blood and desolation
through the land. Is he bound in duty to hold
it from circulation' If he gives it to another, the
evils intended by that publication will ensue; but
then your officer, contends the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, is bound to deliver it, because you
have no power to pass a law abridging the free-
dom of the press According to this doctrine,
that which an individual cannot do, your officer
is bound to do It appeared to him that the ob-
vious necessity of this law was to prevent the
post office agents from committing a criminal
offense against the laws of the States, and then
shielding himself under the post office law. But
the Senator from Massachusetts had not met this
point, but had rather evaded and played around
it This was a question which should not be
discussed with the chicanery of a pettifogging
lawyer, but should be considered with those en-
larged ideas and noble sentiments which belong
to the statesman They should argue it as be-
came enlightened patriots anxiou3 to promote
harmony and good feeling through our common
country, and to preserve all its parts from the
dangers of insurrection.
He denied that property could be affected by
this law, as contended by the Senator from Mas-
sachusetts. There could be no property in these
incendiary publications The postmaster holds
in his hand that which by the laws of the States,
is in the condition of stolen property, and he is
bound to give it back He holds in his hand
what, by his own judgment, he considers not to
be pi operty—which his own judgment condemns;
and he is therefore bound to resign it The Sen-
ator from Massachusetts said, rightly, that the
person to whom this publication is directed may
come forward and demand it, under the provision
of this law. Now, if the Senator thought there
was anything wanting in this provision of the
bill, why did he not propose an amendment? If
he did propose any, he (Mr C ) had not heard
it. The property is not to be destroyed, it must
be returned to him who sent it.
In another point of view, (Mr C. said,) the
