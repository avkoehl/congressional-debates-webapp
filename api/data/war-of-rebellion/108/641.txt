HEADQUARTERS, November 5, 1862.

Colonel J. R. CHAMBLISS,Commanding Cavalry, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: If it necessary you must re-enforce your command at and near Warrenton. That place should not be given up unless the enemy is known to be in such force as to make it untenable. You might re-enforce your cavalry with cavalry and artillery, so as to hold the place against an advance of cavalry. If you can get 500 cavalry at any one point, it should be enough for any force that can be brought to operate against you-that is, if all probability of a surprise is guarding against. Every effort must be made consistent with the safety of your command to ascertain the force of the enemy in your front and his intentions. If it be necessary move all of your cavalry to the front, and your section of artillery. Feel the enemy whenever and wherever you can find him.

Very respectfully,

J. LONGSTREET,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you cause Captain McCarthy with his section of artillery to proceed at once to Brandy and report for duty to Colonel John R. Chambliss, commanding cavalry. The other section of his battery is there, and will be united under his command if constant with the exigency of the command there.

I am, general, very respectfully,

G. M. SORREL,
