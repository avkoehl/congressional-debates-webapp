FORT JACKSON, LA., April 24, 1862.

CAPTAIN: From all we can see and learn, the enemy, with the exception of one or two gunboats, has passed up the river, so that there will be no use in changing your present position to one farther above. I regret to learn the condition of the volunteer troops on board the W. Burton; this, together with the exhausted condition of your crew, will prevent your taking up the position below which was agreed upon this morning for the present. You may be able to take it up, however, when your crew recover from their fatigue and when you are able to control the irregularities of the volunteers.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. K. DUNCAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Coast Defenses.

Captain J. K. MITCHELL,

Commanding C. S. Naval Forces, Lower Mississippi River.

[Inclosure Q.]

FORT JACKSON, LA., April 24, 1862.

CAPTAIN: As I have no boats of any kind, I must ask of you to light up the river with fire barges to-night if it possibly lies in your power. The absence of light greatly impairs the accuracy and effectiveness of our fire upon the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. K. DUNCAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Coast Defenses.

Captain J. K. MITCHELL,

Commanding C. S. Naval Forces, Lower Mississippi River.

[Inclosure R.]

FORT JACKSON, LA., April 24, 1862.

CAPTAIN: The lower schooner will be lighted by firing her from a few-boat from Fort Saint Philip at early dusk. As this light dies away one next one above will be fired, and so on all night.

Unless you can better yourself materially, I would not advise any movement on your part from your present position, owing to all the adverse circumstances mentioned in your letter.

In regard to the Defiance, the authority over her which I formerly had has been transferred to you, but we will freely lend you any assistance which you may require in deposing her commander or in exercising your authority over her.

Keep a vigilant lookout for another attack to-night, when we will mutually support each other and do all that we possibly can.

Captain Squires has been directed by Colonel Higgins to furnish you such assistance as you may require.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. K. DUNCAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Coast Defenses.

Captain J. K. MITCHELL,

Commanding C. S. Naval Forces, Lower Mississippi River.
