I will read what j
affirms that it- was constitutional.
he says:
"Th" Senator fiom South Carolina [.Mr. RuETTjsays
'lie .KJm^Mon ol California was unconstitutional, because
tiic Coi! mution pi vide< only for the admission of Slates.

been so, or she could not have been admitted. I
, hesitate not to say that if she had not been a State
; it would have been a gross violation of the Con-
: stitution to have admitted her into the Union.
[ You, Air. President, never supposed, when you
; came her to represent her as a Stale, that she was
t & .Territory.' i\ro, sir. The Senator from Ala-
| bama does not know the birth of his own State.

I think, then, the argument ol'the Senator m fa-
vor of the constitutionality of the admission of Cal-
ifornia, is not of great potency. It is based upon
a denial that the people of his own State, wer^ the
authors of their own rights and liberty. They
owe their existence, not to their own volition, but
to otlieis. ^Let lnm glory in such a parentage for
his State, if he pleases. [Ie must be hard driven
for an argument to sustain his new position. After
nuiHiec it imre nonsense. Tin; Constitution provides only
ior the .MUMSMOII of a Stxie. TlUe; but it is the act of rj-
ifiibbiOjt which makes it a State. Some tiiirtv-thrce vcais

r^lif to <-<,iiir in hecnu-c s-hu was not «i State, he yet con-
feiuN, with that rr>n,iikabie consistency which character-
ise:, maiiv of the opponents ot the compromise, that Mis-
t-oun did iiave that right. Now, sir, the only dillerence ;
iH-lwocM too two is, that Missouri had angular tern- 1
joriahin vein meat, and California nevei had. JJutthrv were ,
hotn lrrritoues nr\(-itiieie^, and neither could ever he- !
come an\ tiling el <• without the a^ent of Congies^. Tiic '
j,oo|.! M.r both ndopted a constitution, ami *ent it heie loi |
appi.tvni; when appiowd. the} both became States,but not '
uiiti! then.*
JNow Iitc is Ins affirmation that California was \
admitted, because, as he argues, 1
she was admitted _ precisely Jike other Smfes; ,
they wore 'I'erntories as she was, and the act uf !
adnna-tioji made her a State. All the other State*, i
Alabama included, were Territories when they j
were admitted; so California, bein^ a. TVrrilorv
v.-hen she was admitted, wa.s admitted as conyti- I
Lutionfilly as they were admitted. There is tiie S
argument. 1 have in my hand the act of Con- j
£ress admitting Alabama as a State into the |
bijiojt. rhe truth is, Mr. President, and you I1
know it very well, no Territory hat? ever been ad- ji
initted into this Union as a State. In eveiy in-
stance the conr.se pnrbited has been this: Congress '{
passes a-j act authorizing the people in the Tern-
UH*y to adopt n conatnuthnj and form a Slate,
! he people get together, make a government,
adopt a constitution, pur tiie machinery of their
State government info operation, and apply here :1 ^° ^>unies vm
for admission a State. They are States, and :
they cme m as States. Under the clause of the ! ,s holier that t
Constitution authorizing Congress to admit new
States into the Union, their territorial garb is
thrown away, and they come heie robed in a!) the
dignity ot tree and independent, sovereignties.
Alabama, /he Scnafor^ own State, was admitted
m ihat^vay. The iict of Congress passed for the
^flmis^ion of Alabama, begins thus:

They agreed to form themselves into a free and
independent Stale, and they did so. So it was
with Missouri. Here is what the people of thai

Alisbourt was a Sratn; Alafiania was a State*,
and all the olhei Slates that have arisen from Ter-
luoi'ies were full so\creigu!ies when they came
to he adiiiuted into the Union. How was it with
Missouri - Missouri adopted a constitution in
2820. She was not admitted, I think, mud 382;2.
Where was she, then, before she W;ts admitted
into the Union- She had all her oiHcers in full
operation—her executive, her legislative, and her
judicial departments of iier government organized.

As i said, he now supports the whole compro-
mise. So staunch is his adherence, that lie even
says he would not repeal the law by winch tiie
slave trade is prohibited ui this District, under the
penalty of emancipation. But the dangerous fea-
ture in this bill—all that tiie South cared to oppose—
was the usurpation 011 th^part of Congress,of tiie
power to emancipate the slaves m lhis District.
That is what we objected to in that act. Vet the
Senator says he would not vote to repeal this act.
He is wdlin^ to let the legislation by whi-'ii sla\ (•■•.

His asseitKui is, that the fugitive slave iaw lias
been enforced as well as any other law—as Jaws
against murder or theft. Wow, what is the'fact?
, .lust about the time when (he Senator was deliv-
ering Ins speech, the Chrisliana rioters were hav-
ing a j^Iouour triumph in their unanimous release
, lmm us penalties. The murder of a citizen of
I ]\laryiand had been consummated under this very
act, m the Slate of Pennsylvania. Yet, when m
my speech I ventured to suggest that nut a han
. oi the headol oneot theseChnsthinauoteifiwould
be touched, the Senator from Pennsylvania J Mr.
, BiiODricAuj ruse and intimated that I cast an as-
| persion on his State, and broadly maintained that,
hi« State was true to the Constitution, ami would
enfoice the laws. He feared rathei Ihv«t the inno-
cent would be punished than I hat, i he guiity would
escape, How stands the final result5 K\ery one
oi the Christiana rioters have la-en udeased from
all penalties, am! released in such a fonn and man-
ner, toot i saw in the " Union^ the oilier day, a
leitei from a Viignnan, manning whether there
was such a thing gettijig baok a negro at all in
the Irce States' Tiie writer ^aid lluit there were
agre.it many people in his part of the lountry
who desned to re(,.n>ture tiieir-.slave^, but from the
appearance ot things, from the release of those
men in Pennsylvania, it seemed to lie hopeless for
a Soul hern man to attempt to reclaim his slave.
That was published here no! a week a<ro: and yet
the Senator from A'abama says, that 'his law has
been enforced as well as other laws. Pid he ever
bear of other laws where a prisoner w as icscued in
a court of justice in open day, with all the guards
and sanctity of justice around it? Does he know
of any law of the land where those who go to
enforce it are deliberately murdered? and every
criminal, without any exception, from Massachu-
setts to Pennsylvania, have all gone free of pun-
ishment? Why, it seems that just in proportion
as time develops the fact, that the South has ob-
tained nothing by this compromise—that so far
from having gained anything, she has only earned
contempt—the sympathies, the feelings, and the
support oi some Southern men seem to cling closer
to its support. The worse it is, the more they love
it. The more ihey are degraded, tiie more they
humble themselves. I see that, accotdm^ to the
census leturns for the year ending the 30th oi"
June, 3fc 50, upwards of 1,000 fugitive slaves es-
caped to fbe JVorthfrom the South. That amounts
to*8,000,000 worth of property at the market value
of slaves. Maryland alone has lost 379 fugitives
during that year. How many fugitives slaves who
have thus tied to the North, have been rendered
up? Whene^r one is recovered by stealth, by
connivance, or assent, (for some of them come
back of their own accord,) it is heralded foiih as
agjeat proof of the enforcement of the law; but
how many of these 1,000 slaves has the law re-
stored 5 Not one,probably, in one hundred. Yet,
just at this time, when the census is printed, show-
ing our condition in relation to this law—when the
North everywhere treats tins feature of the com-
promise with demonstrations of defiance and con-
tempt-—it is at this lime, that a party rallies m the
South, and goes for the compionnse! the com-
promise ! everything for the compromise' As my
distinguished predecessor said in Ins dying mo-
ments, "The South ! the poor South I God know#
whal is to become ol' hrr."
I have rend to you extract:: irom the speeches of
the Senator from AJabnma.to show that he not
only advocated resistance and secession, but said,
that if a State seceded he would date the Govern-
ment to interfere. Now, whai do you think lie
says in the last speech of Ins, to which I refer?
He denies tho right of secession; and he denies it
first on authority, and then for reasons. I will
read his authority:
u We aie told that authoiity lor the nsht of •>c(.es>iun is
to bo found in tii0 M^nlution* 01 'yy and ")!♦. So many men
have swufjhl to sustain ab-.u:d iheone- by lel'omn# to these
resolution?-, that t presume we ou^ht not to nesnipti^ed
c\ «n at this last and v\ cal\<\st att< mpt oi ,1!!. Nor m this
•me ot plotless is a to be wondered at, thai the wisdom of
tin1 diM-tplc should fai outrun that ot tho teacher. John
Calhoun and George MelhUhe examined ihc loolutions of
'iV and '139 lor the i i^tit of secesMon, and could not find it.
The\ tound. a-, they thought, nullification, hut nullihcntnm
is a e(i' a denial oi -eee-MOn. We all know that some of
the ablest cftoits made by both of these <rieat men, was to
c-tahh-h that nullification wa  the nyhtful remedy."
j Of Mr. Calhoun he said:
u Sir, J behove 1 loved him hotter while living, and re-
fcpoet linii more now, than anv one of those who make n*e
01 his name to fjive respectability to treason, fie was never
.1 soce.<hionis-tx and 1 am authonzed to say that the proof
will before long bo given to the woihi. fie regatded the
alfmpt oi a -ingle State to jco out of the Union a?> madness,
and died in that opinion."
Here is the assertion that the lesolutions of
1708 and 3790 do not sanction secession. Now, 1
understand there is a proposition in circulation m
the other branch of Congress amongst members to
pimt the Virginia ieport and xesolutions of 1798—
'99, and by circulating them, let the people judge
for themselves whai are the doctrines they contain.
Will the Senator from Alabama subscribe or not;
If lie will not subscribe, I will subscribe a thou-
sand copies for him, if he will promise to frank
them to his constituents, and by this means he
will show his sincerity and put down secession.
Sir, they do advocate secession, because they do
advocate State sovereignty. They deny what he
affirms, that the Supreme Coiut of the United
States is the at biter between State.*. Theyatfirm,
that e-ich of the States lias a right to e,onstiue tin-1
compart of tho Conciliation existing hetwern
them, and construing the compact, they have a
right to determine whether it has been \i"!ated,
and the mode and measure of redicss. These are
tin- positions assumed m the report and resolutions
of 1798 and 3799.
The only difference between the Republican
party and South Carolina m IS32 and 1^33 as to
nullification, was this: The Republicans m Vir-
ginia and els< where maintained that the resolutions
of iYJS and '99 affirmed secps^ion; we maintained
that they affirmed nullification. They said we
