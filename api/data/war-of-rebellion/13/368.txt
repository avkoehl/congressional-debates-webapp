
great odds against them, for nearly an hour. They only fell back when they received the second peremptory order to do so. Not being able to leave the field, I soon after fell into the hands of the enemy.

I cannot speak in too high terms of the steadiness, cool courage, and gallant conduct of both my officers and men. Although their first battle, they behaved like tried soldiers, and I feel it an honor to have been their commander on so well a contested field of battle.

I can hardly express my admiration of the gallant bearing of Captains Blunt, Wister, and Sergeant, Lieutenant Coster, Stacey, Smith, Parker, Burnett, Heckscher, and Tracy, and Sergeants Evanns, Eggemeyer, Lamonier, Keller, Ongheltree, Urmston, Meek, Wagner, and Thierman. Conspicuous even among these brave officers I must not forget to mention Captains Read, Winthrop, and Stanhope, and Lieutenant Van Rensselaer.

I received throughout the day the most valuable assistance from my quartermaster, Lieutenant Franklin, and my acting adjutant, Lieutenant Stacey.
