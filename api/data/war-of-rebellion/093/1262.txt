Brigadier-General VAUGHN:

GENERAL: I reached this place this evening late. Heard from Hipster's scout that the enemy were advancing from Cumberland Gap. I sent a scout to the front, which learns that the enemy had crossed the river-about 100 dismounted cavalry or infantry. Our boys had a little fight with them, in which Lieutenant Hipster and one man were badly wounded. It is reported that Burbridge's force is five regiments-three negro and two white regiments. Hipster think that they are working on the road and the ford. I do not think that Burbridge is here, nor do I think the force any but that at the Gap, and not much of that . I regard it as a demonstration on your flank. In the first place it will be impassible for any wagon train to be crossed at the Gap without several days' work. It may be that part of the Tenth Michigan Regiment is with this party that went to Kentucky dismounted about three weeks ago. I will get up all the soldiers in this country I can to-night and confront advance to-morrow. Will send out a scout to-night and communicate to you again in the morning. If Burbridge is here, he cannot possibly strike your rear or flank for five days; in the meantime, I can give you definite information. I will order Owens and the ten men from my battalion to keep the Bean's Station and river road well protected. The rivers, both Holston and Clinch, are scarcely fordable.

Yours, &amp;c.,

G. W. DAY,

Major.
