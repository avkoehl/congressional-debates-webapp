Lieutenant C. D. WILLARD,

Commanding Gunboat General Jesup:

SIR: You will proceed with secrecy and dispatch to West Point, on the York River, and thence up the Pamunkey to such place as you may deem best to accomplish the purpose of your expedition, which is to intercept and capture a small rebel steamer which plies between White House and West Point. A pilot believed to be reliable is sent to you. Failing of succeeding, you will then return and report to these headquarters. You will endeavor to obtain all information as to a force of cavalry said to be stationed at Matthews Court-House. You will observe every needful precaution to keep the object of this expedition secret.

By order Major-General Foster:

I am, very respectfully,

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY,

Commanding Department:

From information received to-night, it is possible that the enemy may make an advance upon this point in the next three or four days. The report which has reached me exaggerates, no doubt, the force advancing on Elkwater road. I have given orders to Gibson, at Buckhannon, and am as nearly ready as well can be.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH SEPARATE BRIGADE,Beverly, September 25, 1863.

Major GIBSON,

Buckhannon:

It is possible that this point, or some other in this section, may be attacked by the enemy in considerable force in the course of three or four days. You will send a patrol to Huttonsville daily, and should you become aware of an attack upon Beverly, you will throw your command upon the enemy's flank and rear, via the Huttonsville road,
