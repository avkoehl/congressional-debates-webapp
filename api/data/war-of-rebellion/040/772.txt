General HAMPTON, Lynchburg, Va. (or to the commandant of the post, by courier,if necessary):

Inform General Hampton, or, in his absence, Colonel [L. S.] Baker, that the enemy's cavalry on their raid h ave left the railroad at Frederick's Hall, and are moving, as General Fitzhugh Lee supposed, either toward the canal or the Petersburg and Lynchburg Railroad, or toward Charlottesville. Endeavor, on the best information you can get, to aid in meeting or intercepting them. General Fitzhugh Lee is moving with like purpose.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

LYNCHBURG, May 3, 1863.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON:

Will make every disposition to carry out your instructions. Do keep me advised. My brigade is in motion.

WADE HAMPTON,

[Brigadier-General.]

Telegraph lines to Hanover Junction both cut by raid of enemy's cavalry. Telegraph via Lynchburg any news from the battle to-day near Fredericksburg which you may receive from Hanover Junction.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, May 3, 1863.

GENERAL HAMPTON,

Lynchburg, Va.:

A decisive near Fredericksburg. Jackson and Hill wounded; the former severely, the latter slightly.

The enemy's cavalry in detached bodies near this city, but believed to be passing down the Peninsula.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A., Richmond, May 3, 1863-12 midnight.

General HAMPTON,

Lynchburg, Va.:

I do not think Farmville or Lynchburg threatened. The enemy have, I learn, turned down the river on the north side, either for a daring dash on this city, or, more probably, to escape by the Peninsula to Yorktown or around Port Royal. Move with your forces as you concentrate toward Gordonsville.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
