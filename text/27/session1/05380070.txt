APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL G&OBE.
June, 1841:
2fTH Cong.......1st Sess.
abolition Petitions—Mr. Tngersoll.
H. of Reps
The pragmatic interference of toe British Minis-
ter in the case of the Africans brought into this
country on board the Spanish vessel called the
Amistad, is familiar to all, urging the President to
exercise an influence which, according to the Bri-
tish Constitution and our own, it is notorious the
Executive cannot exercise over the Judiciary Fi-
nally, 1 am assured that the same British Minister
went so far as to address a note to Mr Forsyth,
the Secretary of State, communicating a bull of the
Pope against the slave trade. After in vain urging
by negotiation a claim to search Amencan vessels
suspected of slave trade, it is only too notorious
that our commerce is harassed, and our pons dis-
honored by captures on the mo4 frivolous pretexts,
by British cruisers, of American vessels, sent in,
one of them, into the port of Boston, in the imme-
diate neighborhood of the venerable member from
Massachusetts. The search of vessels at sea,
hardly claimed as a right m peace, and which I
deny to be even a right of war, is perpetrated «pon
us by Great Britain every day. The United Stales,
North and South, are beleaguered by her black
troops, while her Abolition emissaries are pervad-
ing all parts of the country After being, from
the time of the assiento till within a few years, one
of the largest dealers in the slave trade, and en-
couragers of slavery, the English have discovered
that th  one is piracy, and the oiher a heinous sin,
and we are to be compelled to come as suddenly
to the same conclusions Wnhin my own life-
time, from New York inclusive, to the most
Southern State, nearly every one held slaves who
could, without any doubt of the legal or moral
right to do so It has been the case throughout
Jhe world in every fage and in every country. I
myself saw many slave ships in the harbor of Li-
verpool as lawfully trading there as any other British
vessels. But since the British discovery of the pi-
racy of the trade and the sinfulness of bondage, we
are to desecrate the memories of our forefathers,
to consider, as we are told, Washington a monster
of iniquity, and to destroy those institutions which
are incorporated with the social and political ex-
istence of eleven of these united States.
The first position I assert then ü independence
of this modem philosophy It think, with deference
be it said, that the inhabitants of the Souih meet-
ing their merciless assailants with whatever indig-
nation, have never yet taken the high ground of
repulsion to foreign interference m which I am
sure they would be sustained by the great mass of
their fellow-countrymen in the State to which I
belong, and I have no doubt all the central, and
probably Eastern Slates of this Union Let them
stop the foreign source of this derogatory agita-
tion. Let us altogether as«ert the rights and the
character of the csunlry against mtelerable ag-
gression I call upon the hcnorable gentleman
just appointed chairman of the Co miUee on Na-
val Affair ., [Mr. Wise,] by the proper action of
Congress, to request his friend, the President of the
United States, to instruct my colleague, who it is
said is shortly to represent us in Great Britain, to
retaliate this insulting mterfeience by earnestly re
presenting to the British Government the expense
and annoyances we endure by its military conirol
of eight hundred thousand Canadians, of eight
millions of oppressed Irish, of one hundred millions
enslaved East Indians, and oí perhaps three hun-
dred millions of unoffending Chinese, to be re
duccd to subjugation Let it be represented in the
blandest terms of diplomatic intercourse which hu
manity requires and good policy enjoins, that thG
Irish people should be allo*ed a Legislature of
ther own for their local a/Tair-, that our en ex-
perience proves that a great central Legislature for
remote mun cipahties is not Ikss injurious to them
than to the metropolitan state Let them be told
that the m'erest they expiess for the emancipat on
of our slave , we heartily re^iproca'e for iheirs
Pot a "top, m short, sir, 10 t"e impertinent inter
meddling of the English Government and Engh h
individuals with our establish d institutions by
similar remonstrances against such of their* as
are much more obnoxious to complaint, and my
life upon it, in a very short time Aboli-
tion wiU be much less agitated than it is.
The source of it is in England,  the  streams
are but tributary which Sow through parts of this
country. Let me say to the torrid South, that wuh
all its animation, it has never repelled with sqffi-
vigor this foreign invasion ef its rights, and traduc-
tion of its character. In the central States, I be-
lieve we are almost all nearly of one mind respect-
ing slavery as an evil and slavery as a right. The
gentleman from Massachusetts spoke of the Penn-
sylvania act of Assembly, which led the way to
Abolition, as an event of thirty or forty years ago
Sir, it is sixty years since that statute was enacted
for the gradual abolition of slavery wiihm the
State. Even then, before a Federal Constitution
had imposed its obligations, none of the wise and
benevolent originators of that act thought of imme-
diate emancipation even mthm their own Slate, or
of interfering with slavery at all in any other. It
was reserved for modern subserviency to British
propagandist , to denounce bondage, and attempt
to put an end to it extra territorially The people
of the South may rely upon it, that those of Penn-
sylvania, and, I be'ieve, of all the free States, are
still as aveise a  ever to such injustice There is
Utile or no difference of sentiment upon the sub-
ject. We c< nsider it an evil which we are happy
to be rid of, but we are unwilling to judge for those
of other States, who may or may not think as we
do, and with whose institutions we have no
right to Inteifere, directly or indirectly, either by
agitation or by law, whom, on the contrary, we are
bound to maintain in all their federal rights, and
to let alone in all their State rights I repeat, then,
that the policy and the duty of the South, instead
of the futile expressions of lofty indignation, is to
vindicate themselves by uniting with the North to
repeal foreign disparagement, to rouse the enthu-
siasm of patriotism, to repel that of fanatiscism,
and thus to put an end to its aggressions. For my
own part, I do not hesitate to call myself an Abo-
litionist, in the sense of Washington, and Jefferson,
and Madison, and Marshall. In that sentiment,
the people of my Slate, and I believe nearly all
those of the Middle States—the great cential zone
which binds this Union togetner—are well nigh
unanimous, and altogether resolved, without dis
unction of party, ready, by all lawful means, to
put down those who propoxate and foment the dis-
memberment of the Union and digra-e of the
American national character We see, with infi-
nite regret, ihe collision which malignant foreign
influence ha* brought about between Virginia and
New Yoik, and between Mame and Georgia.
We deplore and desire to control the ungenerous
and hostile spirit lo which these collisions of con-
federated States are ascnbable. We cannot think
without the utmost paw, of ihe dreadlul issues they
may lead to, and there is nothing within the con-
stitutional means of ihis Government which we
are not disponed to do to protect the Southern Stales
m the peaceable and undislurbed enjoyment of
their unquestionable State rights and long esta-
blshed institutions free from the molestation, the
malevolence, and the interference of any kind, of
either English or American assailants, combined or
separately. All that the South has to do is to take
its stand of actual defiance and reaction, to act
upon foreign Governments influencing American
aggression, as this Government may be induced to
do, to call for t' e abolition of the military despo-
tism of Canada, of the repeal of the despotic union
by which England holds in Ireland one of the great
fountains of American increase, to resist and
puní h the audacious and insulting seizures of our
vessels, became «o frequent of late by British
cruiser , ar>d all oilier vexatious and insulting in-
flictions of British modern philanthropby upon
American institutions and independence—this is
what we have to do fo staunch at once and forever
the great source of the-e bitter waters of agitation
Tte venprable member from Massachusetts talks
of an insurrection of thesla/erand servile war,
wi h an argumentative compo lire wh.ch I cannot
conceive of Su, I wai astonished, and I must
 ay my blood curdled with horror, when I heard a
gentleman of his high and influential position,
whose sentiments must make a deep impression,
not only throughout this country, but abroad, a
past President of the United States, declare on this
floor—let me be corrected if I misunderstood him
__that in the event of a servile war, the Consti-
tution of the United States would authorize the
catastrophe of the universal emancipation of all
the slaves of the eleven slave States of this Union
by means of the treaty-making power.
Mr. ADAMS here ro«e m explanation, and said
he did not say that, in the event of a servile war
or insurrection, the Constitution of the United S'ates
would be at an end. What he did say was this-
that, in the event of a servile war or insurrection
of slaves, if the people of the free States were
called upon to suppre«s the insurrection, and to
spend their blood and treasure in putting an end to
the war—a war in which the distinguished Virgi-
nian, the author of the Declaration of Indepen-
dence had said that "God has no attnbule m fa-
vor of the master"—then he would not say that
Congress might not interfere with the mstitu'ion of
slavery in the States, and that, through the treaty-
making power, universal emancipation might not be
the result. And he would say, further, that, if
this twenty first rule is reinstated, the people of the
North will be ipso facto absolved from all obliga-
tions under the Constitution.
Mr INGERSOLL resumed This is no time,
Mr Sp alter, to deal with constitutional doctrine,
so easily refutable. Yet I cannot refrain from
remarking that the honorable gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts attributes to the Executive branch of
this Government a prepotency hitherto unheard of.
It was he who formerly, I think, denied that by the
treaty-making power, Louisiana, with all its off-
spring of States, could be incorporated wuh this
Union. And it is he who now assigns to the trea-
ty-making power the formidable ard destructive
faculty of sundering the Union, and desolating one
third of it in frightful extermination, by refusal, as
uncharitable as it would be unconstitutional, to
suppress an insurrection of the slaves. All South-
ern abstractions may hide their diminished heads
before this prodigious and portentous distraction of
that most experienced and distinguished slates-
man Speaking also, as I always do, with reve-
rence for the pnruy of his motives, and the eleva-
tion of his character, I must add that Carolina nul-
lify ation is insignificant contrasted with the tran-
scendental abruption of his Northern divergance,
which, ipso facto, dissolves the whole ISorth from
all Federal allegiance by force of a mere rule for
ordering the business of this House.
My present drift is not, however, with the con'
ftitulional right of emancipation, but to say a few
words upon the habit which has become so corr-
mon as to be quite inveterate, both m this House
and out of it, of contemplating disunion by a ser-
vile war, as a simple occurrence upon which we of
the North, after the example of British instruc-
tors may speculate with the coldest philosophy,
if not dwell with delight. No man knows better
than the venerable member ftom Massachusetts,
what history teaaches of those most dreadful of all
scourges, war m its most appalling inflictions, war
between master and slave. He well knows how
Roman history teems with accounts of the ten ser-
vile wars which afflictfd that Republic, how they
began m the most trivial occurrences—were con-
ducted through years and oceans of bloodshed—
army after army, led by the most consummate
generals, overthrown—whole regions devastated—
modern Spain and Portugal, and o her pans of the
Roman empire, wasted with wor«e than modern
Spanish or Vendean warfaie—and at last, as was
invariably the case, the slaves utterly crushed, ex-
terminated, annihilated
Sir, in an authentic account of an intended in-
surrection of the blacks of the city of Charleston,
a few years ago, it appeared m testimony, by the
confessions of some of them, whom it was neces-
sary to execute, that they were impressed with a
belief that the English were to come to help them—
that the American; could do nothing against
the English, and that the English would carry
them off to St Domingo One of tnem siat d that
he had been seduced to revolt, partly bv a speech
brought to him, which he was told had been de-
livered by a most distinguished and honorable gen-
tleman, formerly, like the member from Massa-
chusetts, the representative of this country in Great
Britain, who was said to be the black man's friend,
