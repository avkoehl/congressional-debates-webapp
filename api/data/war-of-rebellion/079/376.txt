HDQRS. SECOND CAV. DIV., DEPT. OF THE CUMBERLAND,Gaylesville, October 20, 1864 - 9. 30 a. m.

Brigadier-General COX,

Commanding Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: I have reached this place with but little skirmishing. I learn that only one corps of infantry - Steward's - passed through here; it went on toward Blue Pond. The other two corps two corps are reported to have passed down Shinbone Valley, and in the same direction; no one knows where they have gone from that point, where there are roads leading everywhere. A pontoon had been down at Edwards' Ferry until last Thursday, when it was taken up on the other side. I will take the Blue Pond road from town and send back any information. I will meet opposition, I suppose, in a short time.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, &c.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,Little River, October 20, 1864 - 1 p. m.

Brigadier General J. D. COX,

Commanding Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: I have reached this point with the usual obstructions and skirmishing. I learn from different citizens the same story, viz, that the rebel infantry passed by Blue Pond yesterday and took the left hand road to the Coosa and camped nine miles from Blue Pond. The rebel cavalry hold Little River and I am not yet over. As it is a considerable stream I do not yet know if I can force a crossing.

Very respectfully, &c.,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding DIVISION.
