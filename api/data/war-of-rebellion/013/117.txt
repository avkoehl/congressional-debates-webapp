I transmit herewith the reports of brigade, regimental, and battery commanders.

I desire to make honorable mention of Captain John S. Godfrey, the assistant quartermaster of the division, for his zealous, faithful, and meritorious services in the performance of all of his duties from the commencement of the campaign.

As no official list has been furnished the major-general commanding the corps of the loss sustained by the division I have the honor to command since the 1st day of June last, I herewith forward it.* The number as will be seen, is 847, making the aggregate of my loss in battle since the opening of the campaign in the Peninsula 2,589.

And in this connection I may be permitted to add, in justice and fidelity to the living and the dead, that the brave officers and men whose honor and welfare were confided to my care have uniformly slept on the field on which they have fought; that in all their encounters with the enemy, whether involving the whole force of the division or down to an affair between the pickets, they have inflicted heavier blows than they have received, and under all their toils, hard-ships, and privations have evinced a cheerfulness, obedience, fortitude, and heroism which will never fail to command the gratitude, reverence, and admiration of their chief.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Captain CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Third Army Corps.
