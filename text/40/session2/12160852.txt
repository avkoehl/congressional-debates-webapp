THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 80,
the improved condition of the freedmen and
their industrious and law-abiding conduct, and
also their shameful and outrageous treatment
in some Slates, especially in Texas and Ken-
tucky ; but enough has been given for my pur-
pose.
W hat will be the consequences if the recon-
struction measures of Congress should fail,
and the rebels and their sympathizers gain the
control of the Government? In such a result
I foresee repudiation, general ruin, a proba-
ble war of races, engendered by an attempt to
reduce four million people to slavery, or a serf-
dom and peonage worse than slavery, and the
establishment of rebel rule, with a large in-
crease of their political power. During the
war the copperhead party of the North was
the north wing of the rebel army. Now the
rebels are the south wing of the Democratic
party. The Pendleton Democracy of the North
and the Conservative squad are cooperating
with the Davis Democracy of the South to
defeat reconstruction. Their positions and
principles are identical. The northern wing
declared the war a failure in 1804, and they
wish now to make it so by taking away the
fruits of victory and restoring the rebel States
on the action of traitors and giving them more
power in Congress and the nation than they
had the day they rebelled. I charge the Dem-
ocratic party with designing to absolve the
rebels from all guilt for treason. I charge the
same party with a determined purpose to defeat
reconstruction, unless it can be done in the
interests of rebels, and the cry of'' military des-
potism,"' " arbitrary power," "violation of the
Constitution," &c., are the means they employ
for this end. I charge them with greatly exag-
ferating the expense of reconstruction and the
'reedmen's Bureau, when the southern wing,
aided by their northern friends, created this
expense and untold amounts besides by their
rebellion. Having made these expenses and
laid grievous burdens upon the people, they now
have the effrontery to charge the Republicans
with increasing the taxes.
I contend that the practical results of the tri-
umph of the elements of the Democratic party
would be repudiation of the national debt, or
the paymeut of the rebel debt, as also indem-
nity for emancipated slaves, which would pro-
duce repudiation.
I charge the Democratic party with seeking
to give undue political power to the rebel
States by increasing their representation in
Congress and their electoral votes for Presi-
dent; by attempting to make one white rebel
in South Carolina equal to three white loyal
men in New Hampshire. Such will be the result
if the reconstruction measures are defeated,
and the colored men not allowed to vote. The
Constitution as it now is, unless you admit that
the amendment known as the fourteenth article
has been ratified, bases representation in Con-
gress upon free persons, and upon "three fifths
of all others." Slavery has ceased to exist,
and now there are no '• others'' than free per-
sons; therefore the States that had slavery, in
fi xi ng their share of power in the Government in
the future, will count every negro, not as three
fifths of a man, but as a whole man, and then
to vote for him as being unfit to vote for him-
self. The Democrats demand that when these
States are reconstructed on their plan the vote
of Wade Hampton, of South Carolina, shall
have the power of the votes of Governor Harri-
man, Judge Perley, and John G. Sinclair, of
New Hampshire, all put together. President
Johnson makes this demand, and the Demo-
crats insist npon it.
The negro population in the ten disorganized
States and Kentucky will give the rebels twenty-
eight members of Congress and the same num-
ber of electoral votes. The emancipation of
the slaves, resulting from the rebellion, will
give to eight of the worst rebel States nine
additional members of Congress, and take from
the old free States thirteen members of Con-
gress, and a like number of electoral yotes—
making a gain to the rebel States of twenty-
Awo members. The old free States have now 1
one hundred and fifty-eight members of the
House, and the former slave States eighty-five.
By a new apportionment, under the altered
condition, the old free States will have one hun-
dred and forty-five, and the former slave States
ninety-four. I have prepared with great care
and aacuracy the following table, showing the
popnlution, white and colored, and the totals in
each State in 1800, the number of Representa-
tives under the present apportionment, and the
number to be under the new, and the loss and
gain in certain States :

The original apportionment was one less to
each of the States marked by a star, the whole
number being two hundred and thirty-three,
but the fractions being large Congress, by law
of March 4, 1802, increased them one each.
West Virginia hasthree Representatives, but
as this State ,has been created out of Virginia
since the census of 1800 and the apportion-
ment, and as its population was then included
in Virginia no account of it is made in this cal-
culation. If it is allowed three Representatives
under a new apportionment Virginia would
probably have three less.
This table shows that it requires only 48,504
white inhabitants in South Carolina for a Rep-
resentative, whereas it takes 108,527 in New
Hampshire; that it takes only 58,983 in Mis-
sissippi, but requires 124,450 in California;
that it takes only 59,00-5 in Louisiana, but re-
quires 184,708 in Iowa; and that it takes only
74,948 of the same class in Georgia, but requires
132,129 in New York. In South Carolina there
was by the last census 291,388 white inhabit-
ants, and in New Hampshire 325,579. But
South Carolina had 412,320 colored people, who
are not fit to vote or hardly live, and she will
have six Representatives, while New Hamp-
shire, with 35,000 more white inhabitants, will
have only two. I cannot see the equality here;
but perhaps South Carolina, in the estimation
of the Senator from Wisconsin, has behaved so
remarkably well during the past six years, and
cost us so little money and life, that she is enti-
tled to this consideration and superiority. , It
may be that one man in that State, with all his
treason, is equal to three in New Hampshire ;
but I think the people will fail to see it.
We offered these States in the constitutional
amendments the alternative to allow the ne-
groes to vote or have the colored population
taken from their representative basis. They
would not do either, but, under the lead of Mis
Johnson and the Democratic party, rejected
the proposition with scorn. They have the
insolence, and the Democratic party say they
are right, to claim a gain and advantage on
account of their treason. If the negroes can
be allowed to vote this matter will be all right
and they should have the increase, for it is then
based on voters, and the loyal and liberty-lov-
ing blacks will in part, at least, neutralize the
disloyal votes, and the members of Congress
from that section will not be all rebel sympa-
thizers. We hear much said about this being
a " white man's Government." Iam for equal
rights for all; for "a Government of the peo-
ple, for the people, and by the people." But
if we are to have a white man's Government
I shall most emphatically insist upon equality
among white men. I am not for having white
i; men in the rebel States with black shadows by
I their sides made equal to two or three good
II men in the other States.
j I charge the south wing of the Democratic
1! party with being the prime movers in the rebel-
I lion, and the northern wing with giving them
i aid and comfort. I charge the Democratic
party generally with having caused the war
JI and brought all the expense, suffering, woe,
, and death upon the country. I charge that
every man who opposed the recruitment of our
, armies during the war, who denounced the
| draft, who encouraged desertions, and who
IJ in any way aided the rebellion, is now a sup-
| porter of the Democratic party and opposed
j to loyal supremacy. I charge that all the fos-
sils, who had no sympathy and no money for
our own suffering soldiers and whose bloodless
hearts, during the long struggle for national
1 existence, were never animated by one pulsa-
! tion of love and commiseration for our imper-
iled country, are supporters of the Democratic
party and opposed to loyal reconstruction. I
charge that all the rebels, who tried to destroy
the Republic, who murdered our wounded sol-
diers on the battle-field and starved our brave
men in prison-pens, who sought to poison the
water we drank, who sought to introduce the
germs of yellow-fever pestilence among our
people, and tried to burn peaceful and defense-
less cities, are supporters of the Democratic
party and opposed to loyal reconstruction.
_ Andrew Johnson made a speech at Louis-
ville, Kentucky, just prior to the last presi-
dential election, from which the following is
an extract:
"The pseudo Democratio party is the rebel party
of the United States, composed in innjor part of the
rebels and lurking traitors in our midst, who urc as
much engaged in the attempted overthrow of the
Government &3 the traitors under Jeff. l)avis. The
