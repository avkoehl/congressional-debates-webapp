Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

L. B. Lowe, of Selma, Ala., has your permission to visit the prison at this place to seek workmen for a rolling mill. He has found them. Shall I deliver them to him? I think the policy a very doubtful one. Please answer it as soon as convenient.

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.

Mr. Lowe may take the workmen on their parole, so that they may be under command.
