MESSAGE PROM THE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate, by
AgBDRt Dickins, their Secretary, informing the
House that the Senate had passed an act (S. No
431) for the relief of John Ferguson and others;
also, that they had passed a resolution (H. R
No. 11) for the purchase of Dr. Kane's forth-
coming work on Arctic explorations, and for the
presentation of medals to Dr. Kane, his officers
and men, with an amendment, in which bill and
amendment he was directed to ask the concur-
rence of the House.
TERRITORIAL BUSINESS.
Mr. GROW. I desire that the House shall
now set apart the usual time for the consideration
of territorial business; and I would suggest three
days from the second Tuesday of January.
Air. HOUSTON. I would suggest to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania, that the second Tues-
day of January is sooner than those territorial
lulls can be prgoared for action. It is important
that the bills should not only be reported, but
frinted. I would suggest the third Tuesday of
anuary.
Mr. GROW. I am not particular as to the
time, and 1 accept the gentleman's suggestion.
No objection being made, three days from
and including the third Tuesday of January
next were then sot apart for the consideration of
territorial business.
TEXAS CREDITORS.
Mr. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. A resolution
came yesterday from the Senate having reference
to the Texas claims. It is important that the
House should Jjct upon it, if at all, before the
1st of January. I ask that it may be taken from
the Speaker's table, and referred to the Committee
of Ways and Means.
Mr. SHORTER. I object.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I will say to the
gentleman from Alabama that he is doing man-
ifest injustice to the most meritorious class of
these claimants by interposing any objection to
the immediate passage of this resolution.
Mr. SHORTER. [ will say to the gentleman
that there is a bill upon the Speaker's table
equally meritorious, which I have tried repeatedly
to have taken up; and the last time I made the
effort it was objected to by the gentleman from
Tennessee himself.
Mi. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. I call for the
regular order of business.
Mr. HOUSTON. I presume that it is the in-
tention of the House to take up and refer those
bills upon the Speaker's table at some time. I
would suggest that they be taken up now, and
that such as are not to be put on their passage be
referred. In that way we can reach both the bill
indicated by the gentleman from Ohio and that
by my colleague.
Mr.. CLINGMAN. I call for the regular order
of business.

ness is the call of committees for reports of pri-

Mr. GIDDINGS. 1 move that the House re-
solve itself into a Committee of the Whole House

Mr. HOUSTON. I hope the gentleman will
not press his motion to go into committee until
we have taken up and referred the bills from the
Senate which are upon the Speaker's table.
Mr. GIDDINGS. This day is set apart for
the'eonsideration of private bills; and as there
are no more reports to be made of a private char-
acter, I think that the House otight to resolve
itself into a Committee of the Whole House oil
the Brivate Calendar.

properly referred to that committee, and that they
be referred to the Committee of Claims.
The motion was agreed to.
REFERENCE OP SENATE BILLS AND RESO-
LUTIONS.
The SPEAKER laid before the House an act
(S. No. 330) for the relief of certain actual set-
tlers and cultivators, who purchased lands subject
to graduation within the limits of the Choctaw
cession of 1830, at a less rate than the true grad-
uated price, under the "Act to graduate and re-
duce the price of the public lands to actual settlers
and cultivators," approved the 4th of August,
1854, and for other purposes; which was lead a.
first and second time by its title, and referred to
the Committee on Public Lands.
Also, an act (S. No. 318) to authorize the in-
vestigation and determination of asserted titles
to the Hot Springs of the Ouachita, in the State
of Arkansas; which was read a first and second
time.
Mr. COBB, of Alabama. I move that it be
referred to the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. GREENWOOD. There is a question
whether this bill, instead of going to the Com-
mittee on Public Lands, ought not to go to the
Committee on the Judiciary. It provides that
the claimants of the Hot Springs of Arkansas
shall assert their rights in the district courts of
the United States. I move that it be so referred.
The motion to refer to the Committee on the
Judiciary was disagreed to; and the bill was then
referred to the Committee on Public Lands.
The SPEAKER also laid before the House a
resolution (S. No. 25) for the relief of the sugar
planters of the State of Louisiana; which was
read a first and second time.
Mr. EUSTIS. I hope that this resolution will
be immediately put on its passage.
Several Members. No! let the resolution be
referred.
Mr. PHELPS. I move that the resolution be
referred to the Committee on Agriculture.
Mr. TAYLOR. I hope the resolution will not
be referred, but put on its passage at this time.
Mr. LETCHER. What does the resolution
relate to.;
Mr. HOUSTON. If gentlemen do not wish
the resolution to be referred, let it be passed over
and stand as.one of the bills not taken up.
Mr. EUSTIS If the resolution he read there
will be no objection to its passage at this time.
It can give rise to no debate.
The resolution was read.
Mr. EUSTIS. The passage of the resolution
is strongly recommended by the Secretary of the
Tre^ury. If It be not passed, let it go at all
events to the Committee on Commerce. But I do
not believe there will be objection to its passage.
Mr. WAKEMAN. I object. â¢
The resolution was then referred to the Com-
mittee on Commerce.
The following bills and resolutions ffom the .
Senate were then severally taken from the Speak-
er's table, read a first and second time, and re-
ferred as indicated below:
