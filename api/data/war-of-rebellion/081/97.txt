GENERAL: Mass your corps on the left of the Second Corps in such position as General Barnard, chief engineer, may direct, and prepare as soon as possible either for attack or defense.

I am endeavoring to ascertain the practicability of attacking at 6 p.m. this day. If an attack is ordered you will have to take part in it. Hold your command in readiness. Send out skirmishers and reconnoiter in your vicinity and let me have any information you can gather. I shall, for the present, be with Hancock,and it would be well, as my staff are all behind, if you would send a staff officer and a few orderlies to receive and deliver to your orders.

Respectfully,GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
