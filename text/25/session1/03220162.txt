aetisail-been executed in the true spirit of the poli-
cy which shaped its provisions, no sensible embar- ¡
rassment could have resulted from it to the banks.
Tsbe act itself was a measure of wise and necessary
policy. It grew out of a state of things  which pre-
sented these three alternatives An immense sur-
plus of near forty millions of public revenue was
to be continued m the deposite banks, and used by
them m ministering to a reckless spirit of specula-
tion, at the hazard of the ultímale loss ot the whole
fund to the Government, as well as of great injury
to the community, or, secondly, it was to be wast-
ed in projects of Government expenditure, which
■were not merely useless, but highly dangerous and
pernicious, or, lastly, it was to be laid by, m i ata-
ble proportions with the several States, as tempora-
ly dad unquestionably safe depositories, witn the
puvilege of using it, till called for by the wants of
th&nation, in such maimer as they should think
best for the benefit of their respective communities.
Í think, sir, there aic but few candid and patriotic
minds which, looking back to the state of things
which then existed, will not at once decide that the
last alternative—that which was embraced by the
bill—wa«> the oiie most proper to be adopted. At
the same time, da provisions weie of the most libe-
ral and considerate character, in legard to the
banks, from which these moneys were to be drawn.
The whole payment was to be divided into four
equal instalments the iirst, not to be paid over by
the banks h'l alter six months' notice given by the
Act itself, and the three remaining instalments to be
paid at successive periods of three, six, and nine
months thereafter Ample time was thus afiordea
to the banks to meet these payments, and there is
reason to believe that, upon a judicious plan of
execution, the gieatei part, if not the whole, of the
necessary transfers might have been made through
the trade and commercial exchanges of the coun-
try, not only without inconvenience, but with real
accommodation to the business of the community.
A fundamental principle of t^e act was the six
months' notice given to the banks befoie the com-
mencement of its execution But, instead ol this
anticipated transfers to the amount oí ten or fifteen'
millions (unless I am enoneously informed) were
made, and without any known necessity ior them
very soon after the passage of the act In the ex-
ecution of the law also, it is said that large amounts
of specie were drawn and tiansported to and fio
to the great disturbance of commeice, when the
same movement of funds might have been effected
vnih ease, through the customa ry channels of ti ade
without displacing a dollai. I have heard, for ex-
ample, of a casp in which a bill of exchange had
been declined, and a eonsideiable sum drawn ,1111
transported, in spccicjw hen,almost as sr on as the
specie aiuvedatils destination, the bill of exchange
overtook it, and brought it 01 its equivalent back
again to Us original point ot dcpait ire It is not
my purpose, sir, to enter into any detailed exami-
nation of the mode in which the deposite act has
been executed, but I lefer to those encumstances
to show that, if inconvenience and embarrassment,
to any senous extent, have really attended its ope-
ration, tbue is giound, at least, for the inquiry,
whether the fault has been " m the law, or m the
administration ot the law " I am lai fiom imput-
ing any thmg wilfully wrong to the Secretan of
the Treasury, but I am well satisfied that the in-
conveniences which have been felt might have
been avoided by a einTeicrit ei°cution of th° law
If I am not mistaken, Mi Piesident, m (his re-
view ot the circumstances which haye mainly con-
tributed to tne íecent suspension of spe< 'e pay-

sion of the smaller bank notes, but with the real
effect of stimulating and expanding the paper S3 s-
rem, and, if we may judge of the opinions of fu-
ture Congresses by the almost unanimous sense of
the last, wa shall not again be expesed to the dis-
turbing operations of a specie circular The sus-
pension of specie payments, taking place under cir-
cumstances so peculiar and anomalous, and so un-
likely 10 occur, or so easy to be guarded against
m future, proves nothing, m my estimation, against
the general expediency of using the Slate banks as
fiscal agents of the Government But, if 11 were
otherwise, is this the time, I would ask, to wi'hdraw
the countenance and support of the Government
fiom them"* I would appeal to those political
friends with whom I have acted in steady and hai-
monious opposition to the Bank of the United
States, and ask them if they have not seen the atti-
tude assumed by that institution'2 Do the) not le-
cognise her coutiolling influence in the late meet-
ing of the banks of Philadelphia, in which it «as
resolved not to join m the measuies pioposed by
the New York banks with a vie  to an tally te-
sumption of specie payments? It is evident she
does not desire a return to specie payments, and
there is íeason lo bel eve, from ti e laige extent of
the commercial operations m which she has been
engaged, that, however much her strength mav be
vaunted, she k, least, of all the respectable banks
in the country, prepared at this time to meet her
liabilities All hei power and 11 lluence, then, in
conjunction with those of the allies she has enlisted,
will be pxeited to delay the resumntion ot specie
payments by the other banks How important is
it that a design, s.o contraiy to the best tnteiosis of
the country, should be counteracted, and what
mode of counteraction is there M5 piled  il as to
remfoice the other banks with the confidence and
support of the Government ? I appeal then again
to my political friends, who deprecate, as I do, the
dangerous dominion of this ambitious institution,
if fins is the time fo weaken other institutions, who
must be mainly icl ed on to bal nice hei powci and
defeat her schemes
If ever a paity, Mr. President, was honoi.il Iv
commi ted to ('. e prosecution o  a groat public
policy, it seems to me that the lnends of the late
admimstratic n are so committed to the policy of
employing the agency of Stale institutions, in the
fiscal concerns of the Government, as the tiue
practical substitute for a dangerous national insti-
tution. A system of financial admimstiation,
founded on that principle, was orgamred and put
10 motu n by }he Irte Executive , it was attended
with eminent success (01 three years and a half,

this emphatic language "Stale banks may be

of the charier [of ¡he Bank of the United States,]
