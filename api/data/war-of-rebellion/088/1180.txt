General Field, on the Darbytown road, reports that General Lee's pickets at the swamp have been driven back, and that the enemy in heavy force are advancing up the Charles City road and are nearly at White's Tavern. Enemy is in rear of Field's force, and it will be thrown over on the left to attack enemy in flank. I recommend the works at Richmond to be manned.
