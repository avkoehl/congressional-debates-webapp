General HALLECK:

General Crawford has knowledge of Kanawha Valley. Don't know what experience in fighting. I want a man furnished, and will leave it to your selection, but ask that he be sent immediately.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 17, 1862 - 1.20 p. m. (Received 5 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Please take military possession of the Chambersburg and Hagerstown Railroad, that our ammunition and supplies may be hurried up without delay. We are in the midst of the most terrible battle of the war - perhaps of history. Thus far it looks well, but I have great odds against me. Hurry up all the troops possible. Our loss has been terrific, but we have gained much ground. I have thrown the mass of the army on the left flank. Burnside is now attacking the right, and I hold my small reserve, consisting of Porter's (Fifth) corps, ready to attack the center as soon as the flank movements are developed. I hope that God will give us a glorious victory.

Major-General, Commanding.
