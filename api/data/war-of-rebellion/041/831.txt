number of 89 men, for one year. One of them was killed yesterday in a brawl, and I propose to make an example of the murderer.

One hundred and fifteen recruits have been mustered in for the First Texas Cavalry, and 75 into the Second. Colonel Haynes has at Roma and Rio Grande City about 200 for the latter. Thirty-three men have been mustered in for the Twenty-sixth Regiment, Corps d'Afrique. About 175 men are employed daily on the defensive works here, and they are progressing well. About 200 horses have been purchased from the Mexican side of the river, and we expect 100 more in a couple of days. If it is thought desirable to send any of the Mustang breed to Louisiana, or any other department, I could procure 5,000 easily in a month. The price here would be about $45 a head. Good mules will cost $60; wild, unbroken ones, about $40.

A few of the refugees from Monterey sent by Braubach have arrived. When he comes, they expect to be mustered in "for the campaign in Texas."

I have the honor to remain, with great respect,

Brigadier General CHARLES P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, New Orleans, La.:

The enemy came down with a force of about 80 men on the pickets on the Saint Martinsville road to-day. I had already ordered an expedition in that direction to-morrow, and this fact makes its usefulness all the more likely. It starts long before light.
