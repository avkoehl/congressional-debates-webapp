HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, August 1, 1864-11.30 a. m.

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

About 220 dead were found between the lines and are now buried. About twenty wounded were found and brought in. These men were mostly colored troops. I understand that as the trenches for burial of the dead were not finished at 9 o'clock, the truce was informally continued till the dead could be buried. I have sent a staff officer out to ascertain the facts and will report.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,

Numbers 35. Before Petersburg, Va., August 1, 1864.

In relieving Captain W. H. Harris, chief of ordnance, from duty with this corps, in compliance with the orders of the Secretary of War, the commanding general regrets the loss of an officer distinguished for his able and thorough conduct of the affairs of his department. In the campaign of this corps in East Tennessee, and during the present operations in Virginia, while faithfully discharging, often under circumstances of the utmost difficulty, the important duties of his position, his usefulness has never been confined to its limits, but has always been forward when the occasion required to assume with alacrity and courage the office of an aide. The commanding general parts from him with the highest appreciation of his services and respect for himself, and his best wishes for his future welfare.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant Colonel LEWIS RICHMOND,Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Army Corps:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that a detail from my command relieved the brigade of the Eighteenth Corps, occupying the line on my front at 9 o'clock. At the time of relieving there was brisk musketry firing, which soon ceased, and everything has remained quiet until this time. There is a flag of truce now flying and details are engaged in burying the dead and bringing in the wounded.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
