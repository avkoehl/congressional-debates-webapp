NATIONAL BANKS.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
resumed the consideration of the bill (S. No.
43) supplementary to an act entitled "An act
to provide a national currency secured by a
pledge of United States bonds, "and to provide
for the circulation and redemption thereof,"
approved June 3, 1864.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The pend-
ing question is on the amendment of the Sen-
ator from Louisiana [Mr. Kellogg] to the
amendment of the Senator from Massachusetts,
[Mr. Wilson.]
Mr. KELLOGG. I desire to state that my
chief object in offering the amendment was to
show the great inequality between the circula-
tion given at the present time to the New Eng-
land States and that given to the southern and
western States. 1 propose at the proper time,
unless some other Senator shall move it, to
offer an amendment to the bill reported by the
committee, striking out the limit of $20,000,000
designated by that bill and substituting a larger
amount. Therefore I withdraw the pending
amendment to the amendment of the Senator
from Massachusetts.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion recurs on the amendment of the Senator
from Massachusetts.
Mr. WILSON. I propose to modify my
amendment, and I ask that it be read as mod-
ified.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The amend-
ment of the Senator from Massachusetts, as
modified, will be read.
The Chief Clerk. The amendment is to
strike out the fourth section of the bill after the
enacting clause, and in lieu thereof to insert:
That so'much of section twenty-two of the act
approved Jane 3, A. 1). 1801. entitled " An act to pro-
vide a national currency secured by a pledge of Uni-
ted States bonds, and to provide for tho redemption
and circulation thereof," as limits the amount of
circulating notes to be issued to banking associations
under said act to $300,000,000, is hereby repealed; but
tho amount of notes to be issued under said act to
banking associations shall not excced $350,000,000;
and in issuing said circulating notes preference shall
be given to banking associations in States and sec-
tions of the country not adequately supplied -with
banking facilities.
Anclbcit further en'tcied. That whenever tile amount
of United States notes and circulating notes of na-
tional banks combined shall be in oxeess of six hun-
dred and fifty-six million dollars, the Secretary of
the Treasury is authorized and required to fund in
ten-forty bonds of the United States to the extent
of such excess until the amount of said notes out-
standing shall be reduced to $305,000,000.
Mr. WILSON. I do not d esire to take any
further time of the Senate in discussing this
measure. I make this proposition in good
faith, believing it and knowing it to be fair and
just. There has been no reason given against
it, and there will be none, because there is
none. It is not in the power of man to invent
a plausible reason against its fairness, its
equity, or its justice. This amendment does
not affect the circulation a dollar ; there is to
be the same amount of circulation ; it does not
add to or diminish it. It simply provides for
withdrawing $50,000,000 of greenbacks and
funding them into ten-forties, for the purpose
of furnishing $50,000,000 of bank note circa-
lation for the southern and western States. It
does not disturb the business affairs of any
other section of the country. It is just; and
all there is to be said about it is that it will in-
crease our interest-paying debt, and that we
have a class of men in the country who have
been demagoging about bonds and interest.
Some Senators are afraid to awaken and arouse
that demagogism. I do not fear it. We have
trampled it under foot in the past, and shall
in the future, because it is not founded in rea-
son, but in the passions and prejudices and
hates of mankind.
I have made this proposition, an equitable
andhoneat proposition, and I shall vote for it.
I do not move it, as was hinted by the Senator
from Ohio, to defeat the bill. I never deal in
that kind of legislation. I always choose to
meet every question fairly and squarely. I
believe that we ought to do something for the โข
southern and western States to increase their
banking circulation. I believe this to be the
honest, fair, and just way to do it, and I have
therefore proposed it. I believe the mode
proposed by the committee will be burden-
some, and 1 regret that it is persisted in ; bnt
the inequality, as it stands, cannot be defended
in the Senate or justified anywhere.
Mr. CONKLING. Will the Senator allow
me to ask him a question before he sits down ?
Mr. WILSON. Certainly.
Mr. CONKLING. I understand his prop-
osition to be, in substance, to withdraw $50,-
000,000 of legal-tender circulation and substi-
tute for it an equivalent amount of national
bank bills. Of course this national bank cir-
culation is to be based upon bonds. Thus,
apparently, the effect will be to withdraw
ยง50,000,000 of non-interest bearing circula-
tion and substitute for it the same amount of
circulation, the equivalent amount of bonds
for which bear six per cent, interest in coin.
Mr. WILSON. Five per cent, ten-forty
bonds.
Mr. CONKLING. I beg the Senator's par-
don ; that is not the effect of his amendment,
as 1 understand, but I will not stop to discuss
whether it be five or six per cent. But bonds
bearing five per cent, in coin are to be substi-
tuted as the basis for the whole amount of this
currency, in lieu of which the same amount of
non-interest bearing currency is now employed.
I ask the Senator, first, whether these bonds
are to be issued for the purpose, whether they
are to be new bonds ; or whether he leaves that
a matter of accident, or subject to the discre-
tion of the Secretary of the Treasury?
Mr. WILSON. My original amendment
simply provided for retiring $50,000,000 of
greenbacks. I did not say whether that should
be done by issuing bonds or by redeeming them
with the funds in the Treasury, which I think
in the course of the coming year will be abund-
ant for the purpose, for I have no doubt that
our receipts are to be largely in excess of our
expenditures during the year to coine if we
collecfourrevenuehonestly, asl hope we shall,
and our expenditures do not go beyond our
appropriations to any considerable amount.
But that was objected to ; and so in the amend-
ment, as I have now modified it, it is simply
provided that the $50,000,000 of greenbacks
to be retired shall be retired by issuing ten-
forty bonds for them. It will add to the bonded
debt of the country $50,000,000 and retire
$50,000,000 of greenbacks to be used for the
purpose of furnishing circulation to the west-
ern and southern Stales. I know that it adds
$2,500,000 annually to our interest account,
but two or three millions annually to a nation
that earns $15,000,000 daily is not a great bur-
den. Last year this nation earned nearly five
thousand million dollars, and to a nation earn-
ing thousands of millions annually a few mil-
lions more or less of interest weighs lightly
against a good financial currency and banking
system.
Mr. CONKLING. _ The second branch of
this amendment consists of this :
That whenever the amount of United States notes
and circulating notes of national banks combined
shall be in excess of $656,000,000 the Secretary o! the
Tieasury is authorized and required to fund, in ten-
forty bonds, United States notes to the extentof such
excess until the whole amount of said notes outstand-
ing shall be reduced to 8308,000,000.
It is not that clause of the amendment to
which I ask the attention of the honorable
Senator, but to the provision in the first branch
that so much of the law as it stands "as
limits the amount of circulating notes to be
issued to banking associations under said
act to $300,000,000 is hereby repealed; but
the amount of notes to be issued under said
act to banking associations shall not exceed
$350,000,000."
Thus the Senate will see that on the thresh-
old of this amendment the Comptroller of the
Currency is to proceed to add $50,000,000 to
the interest-bearing circulation of the coun-
try. Now, I inquire of the honorable Sen-
ator what bonds are to be the basis of that
$50,000,000.
Mr. WILSON. The second section provides
ten-forty bonds.
Mr. CONKLING. The honorable Senator
answers me that the second section provides
that ten-forty bonds are to be the bonds. As
I understand, those are the bonds into which
legal tenders are to be funded in order to
dispose of them ; but the first process is to
issue national bank currency until the limit
reaches $350,000,000. That is a proposition
by itself. Now, I ask him what the Comp-
troller of the Currency is to do as to that? Is
he to issue bonds ; and if so, what bonds is he
to issue?
Mr. WILSON. I will answer the Senator.
If any persons in the country go to the Treas-
ury Department with bonds they can get cur-
rency. The existing limit having been reached,
I propose to extend it to $850,000,000, allow-
ing an additional $50,000,000. Then that num-
ber of greenbacks is immediately to be with-
drawn by the issue of new bonds. If a man
comes here and gets $1,000,000 of national
bank curiencv a corresponding $1,000,000 of
greenbacks will be retired and bonds issued in
their place. If there was no provision for re-
deeminggreenbaeks the first part of my amend-
ment would increase the aggregate circulation,
but it is made the duty of the proper officer to
retire an equal amount of greenbacks by issuing
ten-forty bonds for them, so that the aggregate
of currency will not be increased or diminished.
Mr. CONKLING. Mr. President, this bill
as it stands has the design of taking from the
State of New York and three or four other
States a certain portion of their circulation
and transferring it elsewhere.
Mr. SHERMAN. Allow me to correct the
Senator. It does not take any from the State
of New York, but it does from three other
S tates
Mr. CONKLING. I heard the honorable
Senator from Ohio give a qualified assurance
on that point yesterday.
Mr. SHERMAN. I have since fortified my-
self by the record, and I find that it will not
affect New York. That will make no differ-
ence to the argument, however.
Mr. CONKLING. I differ, with great diffi-
dence, from the honorable Senator from Ohio ;
still I continue the statement I was about to
make, which is this : that the bill as it comes
from the Committee on Finance, in my under-
standing, and still more certainly the bill as
proposed to be changed by the Senator from
Louisiana, [Mr. KjslloGg,] has the effect to
deprive not only Rhode Island and Massachu-
setts and Connecticut, but to some extent, and
according to the amendment a considerable
extent, New York also, of circulation allotted
to those States, and transfer it elsewhere.
I can never shut my eyes to the considera-
tions referred to yesterday by the honorable
Senator from Massachusetts, [Mr. Sumner,]
which considerations seem to me Kj be nothing
short of an obligation of good faith, the breach
of which under the particular circumstances,
I think, would be unusually odious. When I
rememberthe banking system which Massachu-
setts had; when I remember the banking sys-
tem which New Yorkhad, andof which we were
neither ashamed no* disposed to complain, and
when I know from actual participation in the
legislation which wrought the result the alter-
natives to which those two banking systems
were reduced, the fate they met with, and the
mode of their treatment as mere matter of
aggravation, I say that, rather more than I
should in an abstract case of a breach of faith,
I shrink from such a proposition as this bill
makes. Therefore, in any effort which shall
be made by the honorable Senator from Mas-
sachusetts, or by any other Senator, togiveihis
bill some direction other than that I shall be very
glad to join, I should not, however, like to vole
