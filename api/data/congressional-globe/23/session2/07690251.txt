the bill to repeal the act of 1820, commonly called
the four years' law
Mr WLBbT£Riose,and said he had proposed
to give his views on the subject before the Senate,
and if no other gentleman wished to occupy the
floor, he would embrace that opportunity
No other Senator sjsing, Mr  W  proceeded
The question (he said) involved subjects of the
most serious consequences to the people of the
United States, and of great constitutional lm-
poitaice It had for its onject to dimmish the
increasing; power of the Executive Department
He did not consider the powers which the bill was
calculated to restrain, as belonging to the class of
constitutional poweis He fully concurred with
those who thought that it was important, as well
f r the present as the futuie, that some check
shou d be imposed on executive power Opinions
should be left free the right of suffrage should
be exeicised on principle, not to piomote pnvate
interests and party purposes
He thought that executive power, acting on
tho e who uepended on its patronage for offices
and honors, exened a powerful influence on pop-
ular elections But how was that power of the
Pie^ident exerted' Before the act of 1820 the
officer was continued, unless removed But now
h s turn of office expired every four years, and
ai othet might be nominated m his stead
[It would admit that, in the case of accounting
officers, Irequentchanges might be beneficial, but,
on the whole, the results of the four yeais'jaw
rau^pd more evil than good That law gave new
powei and influence to the President Before
that time the President could remove from office,
bu seldom exer'ed that power But smcethelaw
lequ led a íene^al once in four years, when that
time approached, those m office were in a state of
con'mua fear, lest hey should lose their places,
wi lie those out of office were contriving methods
of ge i ing it The officeholder would endeavor to
hold on by subserviency to the appointing power,
tho^e out of office, by greater zeal and devotion,
would hope to secure themselves an appointment,
and thus destroy all that manly mdeper den"e
wi leh should characterize freemen In that way
we weie plunging deeper and deepei into the
abyss at every election And thus things would
go on to the destruction of all our republican insti-
tutions The theory of oui Government was very
p)¡.in and simple Ihe great difficulty was to
keep back those attractions that act upon the hopes
aid feais of the people—to make office, not a
r lace of honor and profit, but of trust and confl-
uence, to repre'-s and suppress everything that
te ided to individual asgrandiztmert It was
ísiert al that every offcei should feel that he was
on offi ei for ihe countiy, not for himself The
Nuv y, the Pos Office, and all other department'*,
were instituted only for the welfarefcf the country,
notapp ndages of executive powei The decrease
of that power should be an important object, to
a I who wished to see the Government broug it
back to its original simplicity Some gentlemen
pietend to see no danger in so small a number of
men as those within tne reach of executive mflu
ence But it must be remembered that they are
men of intelligence and act in concert He was
willing to admit, with the honorable Senator fr m
Mime, [Mi Shepley,] that many advantages
w uld result from frequent changes, but be! eved
it was opening the dooi for still greater evils
Put theie was another part of the subject of
Mill greater magnitude  m  his opinion     It was
the constitutionality of the law     k wis the pun
eipal object of his rising to examine that po'rt
Ih" power of removal had been supposed to lie
wah lh" Piesident since the discussion of 1789
)• was then luliy and ably discussed by the gieat
li¿ms thatfoimed the Constitution, and oecided in
favoi of the Executive, by the casting vote of the
I i-sidingofl oer     ButMi W believed the minor-
i i to hav e been in the right on thatoccasion    He
onsideied   the   deu^ion  as wiong in principle
f he q   estion was, had the President the power to
i emov e fi   m office, except whei e it was especially
delisted by the Constitution > He would not trust
lo that decision   but go to the Constitution, the
si une whence that controverted power flowed
Mr W went on to argue that, as the power of
removal was not expressly de'egated bytheConsti
tution, it could only be exercised by construction,
by implication, or as incident to the power of
appointment And since the President could not
appoint without the consent of the Senate, so he
ought not to remove without the concurrence of
the Senate He contended that a meie nomina-
tion of a new candidate did not vacate the office,
that if the Senate rejected the nomination, the
incumbent officer should continue in his place If
the Constitution had given to the President the
power of appointment without the aid of the Sen
ate, then he might also exercise the power of re-
moval, The aigument in favor of such executive
powers rested on their convenience for getting nd
of an unfaithful officer But granting the incon-
venience of not having the removing power, still
inconvenience alone could not confer power Such
were mere arguments of convenience and construc-
tion
There had been another proposition thrown out
in the course of the debate, that was, whether
executive power was subject to constraint, or not,
by law > He believed it might be For if it was
absolute, ór beyond the control of law, then nothing
could be done respecting it, but all knew that
offices could becieated or abolished by Congress,
at its pleasure Even the time of the continuation
of an office might be fixed The power exercised
by Congress in passing the four years'law, was a
proof of it That law not only limited the term
of holding office, but actually took away commis-
sions which had been signed by the President and
sanctioned by the Senate If Congress had power
to make that law, they had power to repeal it, and
place still further restraints But he considered
the proposition before the Senate rather as a bill
to regulate the tenure of office, than to restrain
the power of the Executive
When Mi   Webster concluded,
Mr WRIGHT lose and spoke at length in
opposition to the bill, and was fol owed by Mr
WHITE in support of it.
The amendment submitted by Mi Cm on
Satuiday was then agreed to
The question being on the engrossment of the
bill,
Mr WEBSTER demanded the yeas and nays,
which were ordered, and are as follows
YEAS—Messrs Bibb, Black, Calhoun, Clay,
Ewing, Goldsborough, Kent, King of Georgia,

NAYS—Messis Brown, Buchanan, Grundy,
Hendncks, Hill, Kane, King of Alabama, Knight,

So the bill was ordered to be engrossed and read
a third time, and then
The Senate adjourned

Petitions and memorials were presented by
Me-sis EVANS, KAVANAGH, and SMITH,
of Maine
[Vli   Smith presented a copy of the proceed
ings of a publ c meeting, holden in the city of Port
land, on the 10th instant, foi the purpose of taking
into consideration the expediency of one or more
breakwaters in the haiborof that city     Mr S
remarked, that the meeting is íepresented as having
been  composed of the merJian's, ship owners,
and  master-,, at that port   and their resolutions
declare the necessity of an expenditure for the pro
tection of then hnrbor and pioperty     I perceive
(savd he) that the Mayor of the city, who is a dis-
tinguished and experienced merchant, presided at
the meeting     The subject, sir, l- ons of vital im
portance to the property of Portland, and, m fact,
to the commercial mteiests of the State of Maine
The work has been strongly recommended as of
great utility, after a careful survey, by an  engi
neer of the Government    An appropriation tor it
has aiso been reported by a committee of this
House, during the piesent session of Congiess
Under this state of the matter, it will be unneces
sary to refer the proceedings now presented to a
committee, but I ask that they may be printed for
J the information of the House.   The printing was
ordered accordingly ]
Mr PIERCE, of New Hampshire,
Mr PHILLIPS, of Massachusetts,
[Mr Phillips presented the memorial of 3,600
ladies residing in Massachusetts, in favor of the
abolition of slavery in the District of Columbia;
which was laid on the table ]
Messrs   BURGES and PEARCE, of Rhode
Island,
™?^ TDAY' CAMBRELENG, HARD, and
DICKSON, of New York,
Mr DICKSON presented the memorial of sun-
dry citizens of Rochester, in the State of New-
York, praying Congress to take the proper meas-
ures for abolishing slavery within the District of
Columbia, which he moved be laid on the table
and printed, together with the names attached to
the same
Mr BOON asked for a division of the motion.
The question was first put on printing the me-
morial without the signatures, and agreed to
After the decision was pronounced by the Chair,
some doubt was expressed by Mr WISE whether
a majority had voted in the affirmative, and it was
.suggested that the question was not understood by
the House
The SPEAKER rose again to propound the
question
Mr McKENNAN objected, on the ground that
the decision had already been announced.
Mr WISE said he did not vote on the question,
and he desired to be informed by the Chair,
whether it was competent for him to move a re-
consideration of the vote upon printing the memo-
rial '
The SPEAKER said it was
Mr WISE then moved a reconsideration of the
vote
Mr HIESTER asked that the memorial be read,
which was done
Mr DICKSON said he would not enter into the
merits of the question, but as a motion to recon-
sider had been made, he would only remark, that
the memorial was signed by the Mayor and many
of the most respectable citizens of Rochester, be-
longing to both of thetwo gieat parties which now
agitated the country
Mr CH1NN said that he hoped the motion to
reconsider would prevail He saw nothing which,
distinguished this memorial from any other upon
the subject Although it was signed, as the gen-
tleman from New York had stated to the House,
by the Mayor of Rochester and other distinguished
persons, he could not perceive that this fact en-
titled it to a consideration different from that
which was given to others It presents no new
argument, it states no fact but what was con-
tained in others, and the grievances which it re-
cites are common to all which have been offered
here It was unnecessary for him to assert that
these gnevances were in the main unfounded If
this memorial were printed, why not print all
which had been offered' There was no difference
between them, if there were, it was not such as to
entitle this to unusual consideration He did not
wish to discuss this question, he did not know that
he ever would discuss it Ihe whole mischief,
perhaps, consisted in discussion This had been,
and still was, his opinion, and he had always acted
in confoimity with it He hoped the motion
would prevail, and that the same disposition would
be made of this as of the many others which had
been piesented
Mr BOULDIN said that he had not supposed
he would vote for the printing of this memoria!
until he heard it read But after having heard it
read, he should vote foi printing it, not because
he appioved of the presenting of it, or of the object
of it, nor that he dissented from the general prop-
ositions about liberty and slavery in it, but be-
cause he wished his constituents to know what
feelings were entertained by their northern breth-
ren (some of them) of slavery and slaveholders,
and the means of abolishing slavery
He said he was unwilling to draw any compar-
isons between the country that he had the honor
in part to represent, and anv other portion of the
Union, but every remark about slavery, and slave-
holders, and slave markets, made in that memo-
rial, in relation to this District, applied equally to
