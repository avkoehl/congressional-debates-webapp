poor farmers and people, but give the guerrillas and Clayton's men all the fighting they want. I don't care about their running too much risk; but by moving by moonlight and laying by of days, they can create a good diversion. Infantry should also move occasionally down the valley.

RESACA, August 14, 1864- 7.30 p. m.

Major- General SHERMAN:

The enemy, reported to be under Wheeler, commenced passing Oldtown, eighteen miles east, going north, at daylight. They passed during the day until 1 p. m. with wagon train. My scout think they numbered at least 3,000. A force of 700 is now at Fairmount, being part of the force which captured Captain Thornton and drove. Colonel Faulkner with 250 cavalry skirmished with them, and returned to Calhoun this evening. The enemy is moving upon Tilton. I will have over 300 men there and a block- house. Dalton is threatened. I have 700 men there and four guns. There is a brigade of cavalry at Calhoun under Colonel Faulkner, besides half a regiment of infantry. I have half a regiment of infantry at Adairsville and two regiments at Kingston.

An orderly just arrived from Tilton. All safe there. Dalton has been attacked and reported captured. No trains burnt. My patrols from Tilton north found all right. The commanding officer at Tilton is sanguine of saving the bridge.
