HEADQUARTERS FIRST INDIAN BRIGADE,Camp Corser, C. N., August 25, 1864.

Captain B. W. MARSTON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: General Watie will return to-day. I hear from men who have returned that he attacked the negroes near Fort Smith, killed several, and burned the hay on the prairie. Colonel Jumper sent a scout to North Fork yesterday (220 Creeks) with instructions to scout the country as far as the Council Ground, and if they did not find the enemy to go as far as the Creek Agency. There is also a small scout from the Cherokees out up the river (Arkansas). We hear nothing more from the squad of enemy near North Fork. All quiet.

Your obedient servant,

J. A. SCALES,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[AUGUST, 1864.]

Colonel COLTON GREENE, Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: I have just received your dispatch. Lieutenant Hulett executed this morning what you desire me to do, I therefore consider the order as already executed. He approached within less than half a mile of the enemy's camps, drove in their pickets, then proceeded three miles down the Camden road in the direction of Washington, and ascertained from the citizens that two regiments of negroes and all the Indians the Federals have are still in the rear. This is what the Federals said themselves, and one thing is certain that no Indians have yet arrived at Camden by the Washington road. The Federals had a considerable body of cavalry with them last night. About one hour ago the enemy were beating drums and sounding bugles. You will please send me further orders; they will be cheerfully executed unless there are powerful reasons to the contrary.

Truly, yours,

D. G. HICKS.

P. S.- I will remain here until I get further orders. Guns are again firing in advance of my vedettes. We have had nothing to eat since yesterday morning.
