Sept. 1837.____________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.        ___________   29
25th Cong......1st Sess.                              Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Bell.                                            H. of Reps.
I ha\e omitted to notice m the version I have
giv en of the Hatement of the chairman of the Com-
raitiee of Ways and Means the fact that he sets
do in the wno'e amount in the bank1-, except whit
appeals to be regarded m the li^ht of special depo-
sileo 11 sp cie, as unavailable fur d<, and he con-
teras ¡hat the available funds actually on hand on
the 1st of October will be only 2,000 000' With
wh"t pnpnety or consistencv can the gentleman
insis upon such a statement as being correct1
"Wh°n did all the moievs in the depos te banks
cea«e iO be available' Si ice the 15th of August
it appears that the amount deposited in the banks
ha-- been diminished some three or four millions
Dots not the g-ntleinaii know that in m<ny, if not
in every, quai*er oe the country these funds in the
bin! s are made a^auable' They are this daj as
avail be as thej have been withm the last three
or foui months The notes of the deposite banks
hue actually b en leceived by a class of the pub-
lic crcdi'crs at par, in -¡orne sections of the Union,
and the d afis of ih" Gover íment upon the e banks
ha\e been notoriously sought after How, then,
cnt'e tept'eimn state such fund as ui available''
I is orly unavulable to answei the puipose of ar
gim-mt her1, ard to lead Congress into the mea-
s res proposed by the Government If the States
shall bp tendered drafts upon the balances remain-
ing m tie hands ot the deposite banks, m payment
ol the fourth ins'alment due the States under the
act of 1936 and the' shall refuse to receive them,
then, v ith some co'oi of propriety, these funds mat
be stat d to be unavailable, but not till thpv shall
be brought to soms «nth test can they be regarded
as unav anable
I ha\ e now, sir, show n that, taking the slate-
men's of the i v rr ti i epoi Is e f the Secretary of the
Tnas iry as oouect, it Ihe fiirds l)mg dead m the
1 iiu's of d S3 iisin   (iiicei ■> le 1 íou^ht forth and
applied m aid of the expenditures of the last quai-
tei of tli' year, as they should be, the fourth instal-
ment due the Sta'es can be paid, with all other ac-
tual demand*- against the Treasury during the year,
and not scarcely more than a nominal deficit, but
if, as has always been the case heretofore, a por-
tion ot the actual demands upon the Treasury shall
not be presented for payment at the depositoiies of
the public money withm the year, there w ill be a
surplus, in fact, still left in the Tieasury at the end
of the } ear
I have also   as I believe, shown, tint regaiding
the estimate ot the  chairman of the Committer o(
Wi)S and Means as correct, if we are penmtted
to employ the amount in  the hands of disbursing
officeis, the Treasuiy will «-till be able to meet all
demands upon it, including  the fourth instalment
due the States, and leave  a small  suiplus in the
Treasun      But  these seveial results are not only
denied, but it is contended by those who have the
direction of the  public Treasury   that even the
passage of this bill   and  thereby rel evmg of the
Tieasury from a charge amounting to $9,367,214,
•Bill not supply a sufficient fund for the expendi-
tures of the remainder of the present 5 ear    A bill
is brought into the House, and there appears to be
a great probabih y thrt it will pa-ss, authonzmg the
issut of twelve millions of Treasury notes'    And
how will Ihe fund ot Ihe Treasury stand then, ac-
cording to the shoving of the officer at the head ol
the Treasury himself
The deficiency  in  the means of the
Tieasury, after pajmg all demands
upon it   duung   tne  current  >ear,
(1837,) including the  fouth msta'-
ment due the Sta'e , is stated in the
report  of the Seer tary at the sain
only of                   -           -           - ^"^TG^CS
If the bill now under consideia*ion
shall pass, it will relieve the Tici-
smy of a chaige duurg the year
amounting to p,367,214, which will
leave, instead of a deficit, an ac-
tual surplus m the Treasuiy amount-
ing to          -           -           -           - 3,490,649
It the bill authorizing the issue of
Treasuiy notes io the amount of
12,000,000 shall pass, it will wv ell
the surplus means m the Treasury to
the sum of  -         .          .          . 15,490,640
If to th s we further add Ihe means 11
the hands of disbursing officer^, the
aggregate surplus m the Treasury
will tl en be             -           -           - 2O,490,64<>
The measures proposed by the Government, if
sanctioned by this House, will lead to this result
Ins ead of an embarrassed Treasury, we shall find
the Government agamm the nossession of a suiplus
of twenty millions in the Treasun' Where, then,
the necessity of withholding from the St?tes the
sjm w Inch wis provided and set apart by past law s
for the Stales' Is it desirable to keep up a sm-'
plus in the Treasury' Is it desirable that the
admiiiistiation shall be encouraged by Ihe posses-
sor] of amp'e means still to go foiivaid m their
ruinous experiments'? If we'ook—as we have a
ri^ht, as it is proper «e should look—to the
source from whence this measuie comes, «e shall
find ample reason to distrust the intention of th sp
who support it, 01 the soundness of the argumerts
b? which thej atlempt to prove the necessity of it
The propositi! 11 to postpone, or rather to repe?',
the deposite <ct of 18(6, comes from a source
which was originally and eminent'; hostile to tint
lav which has nevpr ceased to make vv irupnn it
and all those ef the oppos 'ion who favored its pis-
saee, evpr since One great aim of their pobcv
from that time to the piesent, has been to thv art
its operation, and to make it odious with the peo-
ple The notorious and fatal Sp°c e circular was
conceiv ed m a spirit of hostility to the deOosiie act
of 1836, and I am firmly persuaded that most 0f
the evil which has 'ince befallen the country may
be t aced to the manner in which the Secietaiy of
the Tieasun executed the provisions ot the law
In his zeal to make it be felt rather as a c irse than
a blessing, he con nbuted to bi ng upon the coun-
try the f 111 ota d piecnl loiii"n„v Weuighl

be necessaiy for the defence of the country, in use-
ful public w orks, and in works of no use, rather
than see it distributed among the States Ought
•we to place much confidence in the arguments 01
representations coming from a quarter so paitial,
and unj leldmg ni opposition to the original act
which is now sought to be repealed'
Some of the gentlemen who supported th" act of
183C, v hen it was known that there was a hrg
surplu  m the Treisurv, as a choice of ev i, be-
tween the txtravagait expenhtures whisa thiv
foresrw would be Ihe certain consequences of its
renaming m the Treasury, and the distribution
among the Staies, seem to be under the impres ion
t! at they ai e undei some obligation of principle, now
that it seems to be doubtful whether theic lie mo-
nej s enough in the Treasury to mc t ?ll the demands
upon it, to vote 111 favor of the repeal r( 1! I warn
those gentlemen not to be too easil) p tsuadcd that
they take the light v evv ot the sulject A htt'e
rejection will satisfy them that punmple is now
altogether against the present bill Those gent'e-
men arc not now the «ame free agents in regard to
this subject that thev were befoie the act of 1836
was passed Another and quite as imporiant a
principle 'tar 1« tn the way of their siippon 0' this
bill as that which determined them to suppOit the
act of 1836, md 111 one v icvv of the subject the
principle is the same, ai I will presently show
The questie n now is, w hether the States hav e not
acquired rights undei the act of 1S36, which it is
not competent for Congre s to annul or oelcitwith
out their consent I is a question of power and of
right in the General Government whether, after the
States have accep'ed ihe terms of the deposite act
after m-ny of diem have anticípale! the funds
w hich they expected lo recen e in payment of the
fourth instilment, and made other important ?r-
langements connected with then finarcial m'erests
and condition they will not ha e just c?i"e to
complain of a breach of Huh, if this Government
shall now pioceed to abrogpte tne conpact bv le-
gislative aclton me'ely, ard without a i) commu-
nication with the States I call upon those gen'le-
men especiallj, who hold to what is caled the
State rights party, to say upon what grounds they
can support the bill under consideration' Will it
not'be a usurpation, a e'ear assumption of power
on our part, and an msul'mg distegard of the State
s ivereignties, if, after d ludmg ihem w ith promises
of these funds upon ceriam conduiors, w hich have
been acceded to by the States, we should claim the
power ta postpone the execution of the compact, or
to annul tie whole proceeding unconditionally,
without refeience to their wishes or interests, affit
even without consulting thsm
But, sir, we have the samegiaud object, inviting
us to reject this bill, which operated with many
gentlemen in giving then support to the depos te
act of 1836 Tne question is now, as t len, whether
w e shall s t about curtaihng the extrav igance and
profligae} ot the Government in its expenUteres
We have fried every other plan, eveiy othet occa-
sion, in vam If we would piove ourselves what
h e profess to be—if w e be ourselves li earnest —if
we ere seriously the advoca'eso'" retien-imenl an I
r fonn, we can ne\er hop , in our tune, a more
piopit ons season to make 0 le bold and determined
efTi rt "Now's the day, and now s the hour " It
we suffer i ^selves to be deluded by the arguments
and thf (lev ccs of the advocates of powei,anl
shall let this opportun tj piss, we n ed never hope
again Theie is only one expedient left, and that
is to withho'd tne « ipphes stop the monej, keep
the Tre l^urj diamed and low , cut off the means,
and I engage that the expen htures, foi once, «hall
be reduced to the actua1 wanfs of the Government
I call upon the cvpenenced of this House—the ob-
servation of them, and theie arc some who have
had seah he c for more than twenty jeau—to say,
if any t mc could be so fit 01 promise equal suc-
cess, m effecting this gr°at object, as tha present I
iepest, if the mean-, are not supphel thp expendi-
tni s mu 1 oease But hi v a e v  to account for

The Secietarv has taun cd us witn 0111 e\Ua\a-
gmee He ha^ told us, (0 our teeth, in his report,
tnat the appropriations of the piesent year exceeded
the amount he recommended by five or six millions,
but how is it that we heai not one wold from that
high officer upon the subject of retrenching these
appropriations and thereby relieving the Treasuiy
to uat amount' How does it happen that we ha\e
no estímale laid befoie us ol that natuie' So far
from it, that we Cannot ev en draw from him, by
order, in the shap  of a lesohmon of this House,
anv statement upon this sub e"t á™ we not
hound to co lclud , fioni ll e course o the acimmis-
trition upon this subject, that the deteiminauon
sfid to sustain the late cxtravagance andpiofligacj,
is a means at once of patronage and power, is in-
flexible' But what becomes ot the professions of
th  Piesiuent upon this point' In his 'ate message
he repeatedly adverts to the vntues of economy in
he expend lures of the Government—Ihe necessity
oí íeducing ihe revenue to the actual wants 01 the
Goveinment, \ctwe do not heai of the hist step
taieen by his suppoifers in the House to cair out
his views upon this subiect, but, instead of re-
tí endiment, thr crj is still for more money Are
vvc detuned for ever to be 1 nposed upon and de-
ll ledbv ho"o v professions—by piomise^f it form
and retienchmcnt, which aie e «r to b° lepeated,

adininistraiion as under the late on(, the cors ant
aveiwal et the sternest lepubhcan pune pies, b it
m pract ce <he grossest infract on of e\ ery m xim
of a free Government'
Is it in Ih s respect that the Pi s lent intends to
imita e and walk in the footsteps of his distinguish
ed predecessoi' Has he not illcady insulted us,
bj telling us that the Irte trouble and ruinous re-
v uUion in trade, and the prostration of every wte-
lesi connected with t, \ «e the íesult, m a great
degree rf much extratagince' Have we not been
the Chief Maoist ate of this Republic condescend-
ing to rebuke and insult the inhabitants e>f the
large cit er for their extiavigance, and the luxu-
HjUs indulgence wluch the Government has set
the example in a'l the modes of extrav<gance
known  n the practice of any Government, and is
itself, at this moment, the greatest prodiga! m the
land' Witness the prodigal waste of mone\ upon
eveiy branch of the public service, upon the pub-
lic works in every qvwter of the Union, and espe.
