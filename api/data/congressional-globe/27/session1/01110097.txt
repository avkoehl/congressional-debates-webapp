American people have (0 be informed, and that is
one reason wny every movement of it is combat-
ed. Under this state ef 'hings, the gentlemen who
want this monster so badly, have the modesty to
say it is to preserve us from British competition
and to equalize our footing wi h England in rela-
tion to foreign exchanges. What in reality will it
become but a subservient bianih oí the preat mo-
ney institution of England, controlled by British
stockholders and under the complete intlue .ce of
British capitalists?
He (Mr. Allen) was rejoiced to see m the re-
port on this suoject read the other day by theesa'r-
man of the Faience Committee, the confession,
though ta'd U mad ■• that this c untry has been un-
der British i" fi .erice, and controlled oy the money
power of E sUul. This> is what he (Mr. Al..en)
and his friends j^re be^n te'lirij the people tin in-;
the whola reign of the la'e monster, the Unit1!!
States Bank. Two years a*o, he hir.^elt had
made these \erv assertions now coi ct'= 1 by the
Committee en Finance, a' Use h ad t f whHi, V,

National Gfoveiamei', it obtained a cbartei fiom
a Sta e L°gis!atuie, of which a maji rity were of
different politics from hi^; and this new monster,
which has lately died so hornole a dea'h, could
not be attributed to the Whig party He
sdmitted that tht banking system, as too genera1 ly
practised, -was a monstrous system 01 fraud and
cheatery, and ns was- -'illing as far as in his power
to alleviate its ev s, so tar a^ th ■ District was eon-
c rned, and to g. e ts banks the same facilities
as were enjoyed hj i e banks of the neighboring

the way he ihon^bt most likely to produce the de-
feat of the bill.
Mr. ALLEN «a.d he understood   the Senator
from Kentucky had said that th^ Pennsylvania
Bank of the Uoitec Stales was chartered by a Le-
gislature, a majority of whom were Demociats.
He would thank ihe honorable Senator from Penn-
sylvania to inform them of the real state oí the

Mr. BUCHANAN said there was a decided ma-
jon'y of Whigs and An'imasons m the House of
Represeri*a' ves, and this was occasioned by the
uivis'on ot the Democratic party by the friends of
Mes=r-. Wilp an I Muhlenberg The Demo-
citic part; t-iou jht they had a ■najoruy m 'he Se
nate; but, five c 'ix Senators, who had K n tae
mos terrific ine-njes of ihe Bank, went ov-i, and
by the aid ot their voies "he baak bill wa« passed.

as it had oily been p'aced on the 'ahles that morn-
