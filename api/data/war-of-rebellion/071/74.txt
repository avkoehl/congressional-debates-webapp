By command of Major-General Wallace:

SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

July 5, 1864 - 6 a. m.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

No reliable intelligence has yet been received indicating that the rebels operating on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad are in any strong force. Thus far it seems to be a raiding expedition by some of the partisan robbers that infest that region, and who have joined together. General Weber, from Harper's Ferry, gives much greater dimensions to the rebel force, but it is believed that his representations of numbers are much exaggerated.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

July 5, 1864 - 11 a. m.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

A dispatch from General Grant, just received, states that a deserter reports that Ewell's corps has not returned to Richmond, but that his force has united with the other forces in the Valley of the Shenandoah to go into Maryland. As this may be true, although different from the opinion heretofore entertained by General Grant as to the position of Ewell's corps, your militia or volunteers for short term, in as large numbers as practicable, should be organized quickly as possible to meet any emergency that may arise.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of war.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

July 5, 1864 - 3. 20 p. m.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

The President directs me to call on you for 12,000 militia or volunteers, infantry, to serve at washington and its vicinity for 100 days, unless sooner discharged. The troops to be organized according to the general regulations of the service; to be armed, clothed, paid, transported, subsisted, and supplied as other troops in the United States service; to be mustered into the service of the United States by regiments as soon as filled to the minimum strength, and the term of service to be reckoned from the date of muster into the United States service.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
