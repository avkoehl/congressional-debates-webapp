have left the prison under assumed names with the detachment which was sent hence to City Point on the 28th of April. Their absence was first discovered a few days after that detachment left this place and I telegraphed to the officer in charge of it to Fortress Monroe to search for these men before they (the prisoners) were delivered to the Confederate authorities. The dispatch I believe did not reach its destination in time to effect the object desired. The name of the officer is Samuel G. Barr and he belonged to the Missouri State Guard. He joined us on the 25th of April and left 28th. The prisoners to be exchanged have been in readiness for two or three days and I only wait instructions from department headquarters to send them forward.

I have the honor to be, sir, with much respect, your most obedient servant,

T. HENDRICKSON,

Major Third Infantry, Commanding the Prison.

SIR: The frequent application by friends of the Confederate prisoners in this prison to visit them which if granted would very much interfere with the proper duties of the prison has induced me to send you the following extract from my instructions from the commissary-general of prisoners at Washington in regard to this matter:

It is the direction of the Secretary of War that no visitors be allowed in the Alton Prison.

I have the honor to be, sir, with much respect, your obedient servant,
