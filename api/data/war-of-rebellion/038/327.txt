Two DIVISIONS were also cut off from their retreat, and have gone eastward, many of their men throwing down their arms and leaving. The enemy only succeeded in getting back three pieces of artillery. I have instructed my quartermaster and commissary to send up boats to Lake's Landing with forage and provisions; will you please send a convoy? Please send a boat up to Haynes' Bluff, which I think is evacuated. Our cavalry have gone up to see.
