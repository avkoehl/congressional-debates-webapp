The underclothing should be packed in the knapsacks next to the back.

One or two pack animals will march with each regiment, according to its size, to carry camp-kettles, rice, beans, &amp;c. Where circumstances will permit, a wagon may be assigned to a brigade or division for this purpose.

Officers' servants are expected to carry rations for their officers and themselves. Those of mounted officers are expected to be mounted, and to be able to carry small forage for their animals. Long forage must be sought for in the country.

By increasing the ordinary meat ration and levying contributions of flour and meal in the country passed over, the bread and small rations carried as above by the soldier may be made to last from twenty to twenty-five days. In the proper season, the bread ration may be partially dispensed with by substituting green corn, which can be foraged in the fields. Movable columns in the field should be furnished with hand and horse mills for grinding the grain which they procure in the country.

Within one week after the receipt of this order at their respective headquarters, inspectors, of armies and army corps will report directly to the Adjutant-General of the Army every violation of this order, certifying in their reports that they have thoroughly inspected the several commands, and have reported therein every deviation from this order in regard to allowance of transportation. IV. The attention of all officers commanding forces in the field is called to the foregoing details, and they will adopt them as instructions in fitting out their command for movements which are to be made rapidly and without ordinary transportation.

This order will be published at the head of every regiment.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ALEXANDRIA, VA., August 7, 1863

(Received 9. 10 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I sent a dispatch at 9 o'clock last night announcing my arrival here with my division. I am afraid the dispatch has miscarried. I have received no orders but to come to Alexandria. The division numbers, according to the last field return a fortnight ago, 3,647 present for duty. A number have been reported sick since then.

GEO. H. GORDON,

Brigadier-General.
