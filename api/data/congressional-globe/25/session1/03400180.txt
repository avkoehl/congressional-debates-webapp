own, and since Hip veto, since 1833, has incorpora-
ted lor thai smgle State bank capital to the amount
of ten millions of dollar —a sum equal to the capi-
tal of the lirat Bank of the United State  created lor
the whole Union'
That the local banks, to which the deposites w ere
transferred from the Bank of the United States,
were urged and stimulated freely to discount upon
them, we ha\e record evidence from the Treasury
Department.
The message, to reconcile us to our misfortunes,
and to exonerate the measures of our own Govern-
ment fioii all blame m producing the present state
o*" things, refers to the condition of Europe, and es-
pecially to th-it of Great Britain It alleges, that "
m both countries we have witnessed the same re-
dundancy of paper money, and other facilities of cre-
dit, the same spirit of speculation, the same par-
tial successes, the same difficulties and reverses,
and, at length, nearly the same overwhelming ca-
tastrophe."
The very clear and able argument of the Senator
from Georgia (Mr King) íeheves me from the ne-
cessity of "-aying much upon this part of the subject
It appeals that during the period referred to by the
message, of 1S3&-4-5, there was, in fact, no aug-
mentation, oi a very trifling augmentation, of the
circulation oi the country, «nd that the message
has totally miscorceired the actual state of things
in Great Bntain According to the publications to
which I have had access, the Bank of England in
fact diminished Ms circulation, comparing the first
with the last of that period, about 2é millions ster-
ling, arid although the joint-stock and private banks
mcieascd theirs, the amount of increase was neu-
tralized by the amount of diminution
If the state of things were really identical, or
similai, in. the two countries, it would be fair to
tr ce it to similarity ot causes But is that the
case 2 In Gieil Britain a sound cuirency was pre-
served by a recharttr of the Bank of Lngland about
the same time that the recharter of the Bank of 'he
Unittd Slates was agitated here In the United
States we have not pieserved a sound currency, m
consequence of the veto. If Great Britain were
neir the same catastrophe (the suspension of specie
payments) which occurred here, she nevertheless
ESCAPED it, and the difference in the condition
of the two countries makes all the difference m the
woild Gieit Britain has recovered from whatever
mcrcanti'e distress she experienced we have not,
and when shall we? All is bright and cheerful and
encouraging in the prospect? winch lie before her ,
and the reverse is our unfortunate situation
Great Britain has, in truth, experienced only
those temporary embarrassments which are incident
to commercial tiansaetions, conducted upon the
scale of vast magnitude on which hers, are carried
on Prosperous and adverse times, action and re-
action, aie the lot of all commercial countries
But our distresses sink deeper, they reach the
heart, which ha? ceased to perform its office of
emulation m the great concerns of our body
politic
Whate\ er of embarsassment Europe has recent-"
ly experienced may be satisfactorily explained by
its tiade and connexions with the United States
The degree of embanassment has been marked, in
the commercial countries there, by the degree of
their connexion with the United States. All, or
almost ail, the great failures in Lurope have been
of h >um:s engaged in the American trade Gieat
Britain, which, as the Nessage justly observes,
maintains the (losest relations wilh us, has sufiered
most, Trance next, and so on, m the ordei of their
grcaiti or Jess commercial intercourse with us.
M(st tiuly was it said by the Senator from Georgia
that the íccent embarrassments of Europe were the
tmbarra-siin nts of a cieditor, ftom whom payment
was withheld by the debtor, and from whom the
ptecious metals have been unnecessarily withdrawn
by the policy of the same debtor
Since the,intensity of suffering, and the disastrous
state of things in this country, have far transcended
any thing that has occurred m Europe, w e must
lool. here for some peculiar and more potent cauies
than any «Inch have been in operation theie The)
ne to bt found in that series of measures to which
I have aheady adverted
1st. The veto of the bank.
2d The removal of the deposites, with the urgent
injunction of Secretary Taney upon the banks to
enlarge their accommodations.
3d The gold bill, and the demand of gold for the
foreign indemnities.
4th. The clumsy execution of the deposite law ,
and
5th The Tieasury older of July, 1836
f Here Mr Clay went into an examination of
these measures to show that the inflated condition
of the country, the wild speculations, which had
risen to their height when they began to be checked
by the preparations of the local banks necessary to
meet the deposite law of June, 1836, the final sus-
pension of specie payments, and the consequent
disorders m the currency, commerce, and general
business of the country, were all tobe traced to the
influence of the measures enumerated All these
causes operated immediately, directly, and power-
fully upon us, and their effects were indirectly felt
in Europe ]
The message imputes to the deposite law an
agency m producing the existing embarrassments
This is a charge frequently made by the friends of
the Administration against that law It is true that
the banks having increased their accommodations,
in conformity with the orders of Secretary Taney,
it might not have been convenient to recall and pay
them over for public use It is true, also, that the
manner in which the law was executed by the
Treasury Department, transfemng large sums from
creditor to debtor portions of the country, without
regard to the commerce or business of the country,
might have aggravated the inconvenience But
what do those w ho object to the law think ought to
have been done with the surpluses which had accu-
mulated, and were daily augmenting to such an
cnoimous amount m the hands of the deposite
banks ? Were they to be incorporated with the r
capitals, and remain there foi the benefit of the
stockholders ? Was it not proper and just that they
should be applied to the uses of the People from
whom they were collected? And whenever and
however taken from the deposite banks, would not
inconvenience necessarily happen ?
The message asserts that the Bank of the United
States, chartered by Pennsylvania, has not been
able to save itself or to check other institutions,
notwithstanding "the still greater strength it has
been said to possess under its present charter." That
bank is now i mere Slate or local institution Why
is it referred to, more than the Bank of Virginia, or
any other local institution? The exalted station
which the President fills forbids the indulgence of
the supposition that the allusion has been made to
enable the Administration to profit by the piejudices
which have been excited against it Was it the
duty of that bank, more than any other State bank,
to check the local institutions 1 Was it not even
under less obligation to do so than the deposite
banks, selected and fostered by the General Govern-
ment?
But how coald the message venture to assert that
it has greater strength than the late Bank of the
United States possessed? Whatever may be the
liberality of the conditions of its charter, it is im-
possible that any single State could confer upon it
faculties equal to those granted to the late Bank of
the United Sta'es—first, m making it the sole de-
pository of the revenue of the United States , and,
secondly, in making its notes receivable in the pay-
ment of all public dues If a Bank of the United
States had e-iisted, it would have had ample notice
of the accumulation of public moneys in the local
banks, and, by timely measures of precaution, it
could have prevented the speculative uses to which
they were applied Such an institution would have
b-en bound, by its relations to the Government, to
observe its appropriations, and financial arrange-
ments and wants, and to hold itself ahí ays ready
promptly to meet them It would hate drawn to-
gether gradually, but certainly, the public moneys,
however dispersed Responsibility would have
been concentrated upon it alone, instead of being
weakened or lost by diffusion imong some eighty or
ninety local banks, dispersed throughout the country,
and acting without any effective conceit
A subordinate but not unimportant cause of the
evils which at present encompass us has been the
course of the late Admmiotration towards the com-
promise act The great principle of that act, m re-
spect to our domestic industry, was its stability It
was intended and hoped that, by withdrawing the
tariff from those annual discussions m Congress, of
which it had been the fruitful topic, our manufac-
tures would have a certainty, for a long period, as
to the measure of protection, extended to them by
its provisions, which would compensate any reduc-
tion in the amount contained in prior acts For a
year or two after it was adopted, the lite adminis-
tration manifested a disposition to respect it, as an
arrangement which was to be inviolable But, for
some time past, it has been constantly threatened
from that quirter, and a settled purpose has been
displayed to disregard its conditions Those who
had an agency in bringing it forward, and carrying
it through Congress, have been held up to animad-
versión , it has been declaied by members, high m
the confidence of the Administration m both house ,
to possess no obligatory force beyond any ordinary
act of legislation, and new adjustments of the tariff
have been proposed in both houses, in direct con-
travention of the principles of the compromise ,
and, at the last session, one of them actually passecl
the Senate, against the most earnest entreaty and
remonstiance A portion of the south has net
united in these attacks upon the compromise , and
I take pleasure in saying that the two Senators from
South Carolina, especially, have uniformly exhibí -
ed a resolution to adhere to it w ith perfect honor and
fidelity
The effect of these constant threats and attacks,
coming from those high in power, has been most in-
jurious They have shown to the manufacturing ir-
terest that no certain reliance was to be placed up-
on the steadiness of the policy of the Government,
no matter under what solemn circumstances it was
adopted That interest has tal en alarm , new en-
terprises have been arrested, old ones curtailed , and
at this moment it is the most prostiate of all the m
terests m the country Oie half in amount, as I
have been informed, of the manufacturéis through-
out the country have actually suspended operations,
and those who have not chiefly confined themselves
to working up their stocks on hand
The consequence has been, that we have made
too little at home, and purchased too much abroad.
This has augmented that foreign debt, the existence
of which so powerfully contributed to the suspension,
and yet forms an obstacle to the resumption of
specie payments
The Senator from South Carolina (Mr. Calhoun)
attributed the creation of the surplus revenue to the
tariff policy, and especially to the acts of 1824 and
1828 I do not perceive any advantage, on the
present occasion, m reviving or alluding to the
former dissensions which prevailed on the subject of
that policy They w ere all settled and quieted by
the great healing measure (the compiomise) to
which I have referred By that act I have been
willing and ready to abide And I have desired
only that it should be obsarved and executed in a
spirit of good faith and fidelity similar to that by
which I ha\ e been ever actuated towards it
The act of 1828 w as no measure of the friends
of the manufacturers Its passage was forced by
a coalition between their secret and open opponents.
But the svstem of production of American in-
dustry did not cause the surplus. It proceeded
from the extraordinary sales of the public lands
The receipts, fiom all sources other than that of
the public lands, and expenditures of the years
1833-4-5-6, (duung which the surplus was accumu-
lating,) both amount to about eighty seven millions
of dollars, thus clearly show mg that the customs
only supplied the ncccssaiy means of public dis-
bursement, and that it was the public domain that
produced the surplus
If the land bill had been allowed to go into ope-
ration, it would have distributed gradually and re
gularly among the several States the 'proceeds of
the public lands, as they would have been íeceived
from time to time They would have returned back
in small streams similar to those by which they had
been collected, animating, and improving, and fruc-
tifj ing the whole country There would have been
no vast surplus to embarrass the Government, no
