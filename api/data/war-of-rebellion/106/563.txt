Chico, where they will be taken charge of by you and sent in detachments tot he Round Valley Reservation, and there turned over teo the agent of the Indian Deaprtment. As the superintendent represents that he has no means at his dposal to supply their wants, the general commanding desieres you to subsist the Indians brought iin until turned over at Round Valley. The issues will consist simply of flour and meat (either fresh or slat, as is most convenient) and potatoes, if the latter cn be had at reasonable cost. You will be at no expense in transportating the Indians, the transportation for that purpose being furnished by the citizens. All issues of subsistence will be entrered on a separate abstrct andt money value of sme stated, so that the amount can be passed tote credit of the War Deaprtment at Washington. It is undestood that no violence is to be used in bringing in the Indians, and if any should be resorted to the general desires you to potect the unoffending Indians to the extent of your power. You will send the Indisnss to Round Valley in small parties, not to exceed twenty or tirty in each party, directing the detachment of troops accomapnying themto return immediately to your camp.
