26th Cong.......2nd Sess.
gress for the benefit of the whale p op'e of the
United S ates, as taxes can only be iai°ed by a
State Government for the be efit of the whole
people of the State The power of fixing the amount
to be raised cannot be granted to companies. In the
one case or the other, it is exclusively a legislative
power, to be exercised by the immediate repre-
sentatives of the people, and by no other', for the
public good Have Senators ever looked into the
working of ihis banking system' Have they ever
examined the operation oí f^e laws granting these
privileges? If you have, you know that immense
revenues are raised annually from ihe peopie of
these United States, not to be placed in the public
treasury, but in the pockets of the tax-gatherers,
not to be appropriated to public use—not to be laid
out in building fleets and maintaining armies, in
erecting public works or making roads and canals
—not even to bs distributed among the poor and
destitute, no, sir, but to make the rich richer—to
convert the labor of the poor to the emolument of
the wealthy.
But would you deny the people of this District
privileges which are enjoyed by their neighbors? it
is asked To this I answer, if it is wrong in every
point of view, (as I trust I have demonstrated,) to
grant these exclusive privileges, I would not hesi-
tate to deny them to these petitioners. No length
of time, or uniformity of practice, can sanction
error, or make that which is unjust and iniquitous,
just and right, or give to usurped power the va-
lidity of constitutional delegation
At what time are we asked to do this' In what
condition of the banking institutions, and of the
b «king busine s of the country, and of this Dis-
trict, are we f sked to revive and continue this bu-
siness under the sanction of law? Why, sir, it is
at a time when the banks are going down—when
the public will no longer tolerate then contempt of
moral obligations, their multiplied fraudo and ex-
tortion—when the banks throughout the whole
country are rotting down, we ate asked to raise
and sustain them We cannot do this lawfully,
and happily we cannot do it physically, for they
cannot be sustained, public opinion has set its
irrevocable seal on them It we revive these
charters, and these banks attempt to go on with bu-
siness on a sound specie basis, fairly and honestly,
they will follow their predecessors in the District to
utter bankruptcy and dissolution The reason is
obvious to any one who will look at the suoj ct, the
business is overdone, a fair and honest banking
business is ne longer profitable, is scarcely any
longer possible. When a bank issues its promise
to pay money on demand, it neither has or intends
to have the money to redeem these promises It
relies on the public sanction and endorsement of
its business to give its paper credit. It is a system
of imposition upon the public credulity If an in-
dividual or company give written promises to pay
money which they have not got to pay, and know
they cannot and will not have if called upon,
there would be no difference of opinion as to the
roguery of such men When banking corporations
put their paper in circulation in quantities beyond
their power to redeem, is there an honest man here
who will say it is not equally dishonest, equally a
fraudulent and swindling transactior? And yet ¡tis
true the banks cannot in any other way do a pro-
fitable business The community are getting tired
of bearing all these impositions, the expense is too
great, also, it greatly overbalances any benefits de-
rived from the system, and it is coming to an end
I see some Senators smile incredulously, they pro-
bably have not made themselves acquainted wnh
this business, if they had done so, I am confident
their incredulity would soon leave them How is
it with the business of banking m this District? I
have said that now is a time when the banks are
rotting down, the times are inauspicious tor the re-
vival of these banks, the great favorite of our po-
litical opponents, with its capital oí thirty-five mil-
lions, has stopped for ihe last time, it  stockholders
have no reason to expect ever to divide a cent of
its capital, and its bill holders are in baste to get
rid of them at great di counts, from the St Croix to
the Sabine, they are all failing The stoppage of
a bank is now an article of daily news, which ex-
cues no surprise.
District Banks—Mr. Tappan.
There have been fifteen banks chartered by Con-
gress in this District, six only of that fifteen ask a
renewal of their charters, nine, watch were at one
time m apparent good circumstances, have failed,
the public have been cheated, defrauded, swindled
out of about two millions of dollars by them Have
we any assurance that these survivors in so sweep-
ing a catastrophe, are any better than their defunct
brethren? are they more honest? have they con-
ducted their business upon safer principles' Tney
have had beter fortune, indeed, but that they
have deserved it by better rnnciples 01 better
conduct, no one pretends How many times
have they stopped payment—become insolvent?
Should we not hesitate to grant the prayer of these
pe'ttioners with such a state of facts before u '
without an expose of the condition of these banks?
Without a thorough examination of them, and,
being satisfied, from such examination, of their sol-
vency, can we be justified in renewing these char-
ters? even if we have the power to do so. I think not,
and this opinion is greatly strengthened by the ad-
m ssion of the advocate of this bill, that these
banks aie m such a state now, that, unless they are
allowed to receive and pay out the paper of
insolvent (otherwise called suspended) banks and
railroad companies, they cannot go on with busi-
ness, they will not thank us for reviving their chai-
ters.
Having shown what are the privileges which the
bankers of this District ask to have revived and
again bestowed upon them, I proceed to explain to
the Senate the plan I have propose! as a substitute
for all their bank charters The general scope and
object of this propo ed substitute is to plac the
banks of this District on ihe same ground where
they stood before any char ert were granted to
them To leave them as free to pursue their trade
and bu* ness as the law now does and always has left
all other operatives in the District To take from
them, however, the endorsement heretofore given
by the Government to their paper and business, and
leave them to seek for credit and its consequences
by their own exertions, unaided by the grant of ex-
clusive privileges—privileges which they have so
long enjoyed to their own emolument and at the
enormous expense of the public It is, m short, to
place the ppopleof this Dis'ncton anequaliiy in all
their bus ness and pursuits, to afford equal protec-
tion and encouragement to all, by withholding all
exclusive favors from any, and to carry oat heie,
in full pracic  those great principles of equality
and liberty, wbicn, as yet, in profession, lay at the
foundation ot our Government.
I do not propose to destroy the banks The peo
pie of this country have become so habituated to
the use of paper money, that a sudden change
would not be approved of, even if such sudden
change should not deeply affect their interests I
«peak for myself only, though I believe I wou'd be
sustained in saying that those political friends with
whom I usually vote a„ree with me m declaring,
that I do not wish to <njure the trade or business
of banking, or to impo e any restraints upon it
but those which the public safety clearly re-
quires
I am not, therefore, very tenacious of the details
of my plan What I propose is, accord ng to my
judgment, the best mode of regulating and restraining
the business of banking I invite a thorough exa-
mination of it, and invoke the assi tance of all
who think ,vmh me, that th- present system is a bad
one, to assist me m perfecting, by suitable amend-
ments, what is proposed as a substitute, keeping m
view the gre?t object of entirely severing the con
nexion which has hitherto existed between the
bank* and the Government, and of withholding the
eípress sanction and endorsement of the latter of
the business and obligations of the former, the de-
gree and extent of legislative interference with the
business of banking which may be necessary or
useful, is submitted to the wisdom of the Senate to
determine.
The first section of my proposed substitute pro-
vides for publishing and recording the names of the
stockholders in the banks which may continue or
commence the business]of banking, after the taking
effect of the law, and it subjects all who shall cany
on that business, without so making known their

Senate.
names and places of tesidence,to a penalty. I propose
this, m the first place, to enable the public to judge
what credit is due to each individual banker, what
security they have in the character or property of
ihe manufacturers of a paper currency for its re-
demption, and also to do away all cavil and dispute
as to who are liable to be sued on their obligations
where suits are necessary And, m the second
place, for the benefit of those who intend to fol-
low this business hereafter, and who engage in it
with honest intentions By publishing their name
and residence, they invite an examination of their
claims, on the score of probity and pro-
perty, to be credited by the public The public
may then judge how far it is safe to trust them, and
they will not confound a Stephen Girard or an
Astor with that multitude of penniless villains who
are now under the concealment of bank charters,
swindling the people from one end of the country
to another Then the honest man will be trusted
for his integrity, and the rich man for his wealth;
for it will be known who are to be trusted. Now, the
stock book ot a bank is inaccessible to the public,
and indeed it is of very little importance whether
the public know the names of the stockholders or
net, f ir they are not responsible ior the failure of
their bank Their stock only is liable when their
vaul s are empty, and no man ever yet knew one
cent of stock drawn upon for the payment of bank
debts. No, sir, when a bank breaks the officers of
the bank lake possession of all the money, if there
happens to be any, 'he trustees divide out the obli-
gations, held by the banks, to their bill-holders, and
the deficiency and loss is borne by the good na-
tured and long suffering public
The second section prohibits the banks from
issuing notes under twenty dol ars The banks aie
universally in lavor of issuing small notes, because
they can thereby more completely control the cur-
rency of the eountry, and because they make a
a much larger profit on them than on larger ones,
while the people generally are desirous of increas-
ing the metallic circulation, and lessening that of
paper The restriction upon bank issues has not
generally gone higher than to notes under five dol-
lars I am aware thnt there is great difference of
opinion on this subject, but, to give stability t  our
currency, to prevent sudden and great expansions
and contractions of it, which experience has shown
to be ruinous to the trade and business of the coun-
try, no plan short of prohibiting paper altogether
would be so effectual as to diive out of circulation
all notes which, not being necessary for the con-
ducing ih larger mercantile business, ace thrown
into the common circulation, and form the only
medium for the retail trade, the marketing and
payment of the wages oí labor. Remove ths
paper from the ci culation, ana us place would be
immediately supplied by the gold and silver which
is now locked up m the banks, and of which ihere
is an abundance m th  country The people would
be safer with a metallic currency to that extent, for
it is the «malltr notes which «ire most abundantly
counterfeited and circulated among those least able
to detect their character I know the banks would
lose a great profit which they now make upon
their small notes, (a profit generally and truly esti-
mated by bankers as not le s than ten per cent )
but if such a restriction were to curtail theif busi-
ness, and confine it to what banking business was ori-
ginally intended for, than-., to aiding the exchanges
and commerce of the country, it would render that
business much more secure by preventing runs
upon the banks, bnt whether the peop'e of this Dis-
trict are piepared to !• ave this restriction carried as
high as twenty do'lais, may, by some, be doubted.
My os.n opinion is, that it might go higher, and
tbai here notes under fifty dollars might be
at once prohibited, because there is a sufficient
abundance of gold and oilvei com paid out yearly
in this District to the people, to form a circulating
medium for ten times the number ot those who
live, and twenty times the business transacted,
here There is not, in truth, any want of banks
of circulation in this District, (supposing they are
v. anted any where ) If I was legislating for any
other part of the United States, I would not pro-
bably carry the restr etion so high in the first in-
stance, for I th nk it unwise to make great and;
