and Western North Carolina is truly deplorable. The people are in a starving condition and country is overrun by bands of disbanded Confederate soldiers, who rob and plunder indiscrimmately while making their way south. I received a petition on my arrival from the people of Abingdon to furnish them protection. Echols, Vaughn, Jackson, &amp;c., with 1,000 or 1,500 volunteers, after having stripped the country of horses, are now trying to make their way to Mississippi. I hope my cavalry will be able to intercept them. I leave for Knoxville to-morrow. Please inform me if you desire any change in the dispositions I have made of the troops in this district.

Colonel TASSIN,

Commanding Thirty-fifth Indiana (Pontoon Train):

You will at once move with the pontoon train to Knoxville, Tenn., taking only rations and forage enough for the men and animals to last until you reach that place, say five days. Have the property of said train under guard at Rogersville Junction until it can be shipped on the cars. Let this guard be large enough to load and unload the property. This order to hold good unless you receive others from Major-General Stanley, who is in Knoxville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
