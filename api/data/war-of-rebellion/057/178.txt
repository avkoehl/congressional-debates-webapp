same time as my movement, it completely deceived our enemy, and resulted in an order for the removal of all its non-combatant population and caused great alarm, which seems to have speared through all Alabama. Their time is not yet, but will come in the due order of events.

I also sent at the same time, February 3, up the Yazoo a combined expedition of gun-boats and transports. Knowing that our movement inland would draw off the force from the Yazoo, I asked Admiral Porter to send up the Yazoo a fleet of his light-clad boats to explore the Yazoo, Sunflower, and all tributaries where a sufficient draught of water could be found, which he did, viz: Five gun-boats, under command of Lieutenant-Commander Owen, U. S. Navy, and I sent along five transports, with two regiments, one of white, Eleventh Illinois, Colonel Coates, and one of black troops. My instructions for this expedition are submitted herewith. I suppose it fulfilled its objects, although Colonel Coates has not yet returned and reported, but for some reason, which he will explain, after going up as far as Fort Pemberton, he returned and disembarked at Yazoo City, sending his boats to Vicksburg with cotton and forage. He reports officially having sentin 1,521 bales of cotton, and that the gun-boats had secured 207. I have ordered 1,00 bales to be delivered to the Treasury agent, and I ask that its proceeds be applied to indemnify boats that have sustained damage while engaged in a licensed and lawful commerce, such as the Allen Collier, burned by the guerrillas at Bolivar Landing, and the Von Phul, fired on at Morganza Bend. The balance of this cotton I have placed with the post quartermaster at Vicksburg, with orders to general McPherson to appoint a board to Pay back in kind such loyal persons as Mrs. Grose and Dr. Duncan for cotton used by our hospitals or burned by guerrillas. It is folly for us to attempt to indemnify all, but in this way we can give a support to the smaller claimants and encourage them to cultivate their plantations. The sooner all the cotton in the Southern States is burned or got away the better, for it is the cause of filling our boats and towns with a class of heartless speculators that would corrupt our officers and men and sell their lives by foolish exposure that they might get out stolen cotton and buy it cheap.

The full official reports of Generals Hurlbut and McPherson are not yet in, but as soon as received they will be forwarded, with a map showing our routes of march, &amp;c.

They country is indebted to Generals Hurlbut and McPherson, the actual commanders of the troops in this expedition, whose experience and skill left me an easy task, partaking more of the character of a pleasant excursion than of hard military service.

Colonel Winslow, Fourth Iowa Cavalry, commanded the advance guard, and handled his cavalry brigade with skill and success. His flank attack on the heavy cavalry force of the enemy before Jackson, and his rapid pursuit into Jackson, securing to us the use of the enemy's pontoons, entitles him to promotion as brigadier of cavalry. I must also give him the credit due for his march from Union on Louisville and Kosciusko, and for making his junction with the main body of the army at Canton at the time appointed.

I have thanked in orders the officers and soldiers of the command for their cheerfulness and for their eagerness to fight, to march, or to work day or night as required, but I must leave to corps commanders the duty of recording their individual acts of merit.*
