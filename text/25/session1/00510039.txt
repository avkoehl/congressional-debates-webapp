CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Í39
The following íesolution submitted on a former
day by Mr. LOOMIS, of New York, was taken up
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Treasury
prepare and report to tins House as soon as may
te convenient, a statement showing what methods
have been adopted for the safe keeping of the pub-
lic funds, since the first organization of the Go-
vernment under the Constitution, the length of time
that each method has been in use, designating the
several changes, and when made, and what losses
under each method have been sustained by the
Treasury, m consequence of defalcation of agents
or officers so enti usted with the funds for safe
keeping
Mr. GARLAND moved to add to the resolu-
tion the follow mg amendment
" And that the Secretary of the Treasury be di-
rected to communicate to this House all the corre-
spondence between the Department and Collectors
and P^eceivers of the public money relating to anv
neglect o1" omission on the part of any of those of-
ficers to furnish returns or accounts, or to pay over
moneys in then hands, according to the prescribed
regulations and the laws ol the United States "
Mr. MERCER said that it would occupy ten
folio volumes to submit the correspondence called
for by his colleague
Mr. GARLAND stated that his object was to
ascertain the amount of defalcation on the part of
the collectors and receivers, and if it occupied
twenty folio volumes, he wished to have it laid
before the House, and the people of the country
desired it to be made public, but he apprehended
that it would not occupy Iwo quires of paper to
submit the correspondence he desired to have.
Mr LOOMIS of New York said that the infor-
mation called for m his resolution could be pre-
pared in a few days, and submitted to the House,
but it the amendment of the gemleman fiom Virg -
ma should prevail, he took it tint it would take a
much longer time to prepare the statement, and
would occasion a delay which he desired to avoid.
Therefore, he hoped the amendment would not pre-
vail.
Mr McKAY said that the public money had
been generally kept in banks, and the pun-
cipal part of the information required could
be obtained fiom the report of trie Secretary
of the Treasury on this subject, in 1835 He
however desirsd to know the amount ot losses
sustained by the Government, by receiving and
disbursing agents He tneiefore moved that
the Secretary also report the amcint of losses sus-
tained through receiving and disbursing officeis
Mr LOOMIS oí New York said that the amount
losses sustained through the.se officers during the
last wai was very consultrabie, and it would re-
quire a Ion? time to piepare the mforma'ion called
for by the gentleman fiom North Caiohna. He
undei^tood that the re/emie had been kept in dif-
ferent wa\s—sometimes in the United S ates P/nk,
sometimes in State banks, and sometimes in the
hands of individuals, and his sole s.nd only object
was to ascertain the amount of losses sustained by
the different agents employed He wished to go
this far and no farther, therefore he hoped the
amendments might not prevail
Mi MERCER íemarked that his colleague had
stated that all the information he had called foi
could be furnished on two quires ol paper Now,
a few j pars ago, a report had been made gtving
the names ol the different defaulters to the Govern-
ment, and it appealed that tlvy then amounted to
about nine thousand, and the document made about
three hundred p^es
Mr GARL1ND then modified his amendment
by merelv calling foi the information in the jears
1834, '35, and '36
Mr REED "uggested that gthe better cours 
would be to submit the different propositions sepa-
rately
Mr. McKAY said he ('id not wish to embairass
the resolution ot the gentleman from New \oik,
buthe felt desirous oi ha\mgthe mfoiination callad
for in his amendment, and he hoped the gentleman
would accept it as a modification of his pioposition
If, however, the gentleman could not accept it he
would withdiaw his amendment.
Mr. LOOMIS remarked that the information dt-
sired by his resolution was of last importance to
the House, and interest to the countrj We were
now considering the subject, and thu information
was of the utmost importance in our deliberations,
and he hoped gentlemen would not embairass his
proposition with amendments in relation to matters
which would require much ume to answer He
had no objection to calling for the information de-
sired by the gentleman from North Carolina, but
he hoped the proposition would be introduced
separately.
Mr "WHITTLESEY of Ohio was ol opinion,
that the information called for by the two gentlemen
in their amendments, would require months to an-
swer, as the reports on the subject were very vo-
luminous He should, however, not object to the
inquiries, provided that the propositions weie sub-
mitted separately, but he hoped gentlemen would
not now press them as amendments to the proposi-
tion before the House
Mr McKAY tnen withdrew his amendment.
Mr GARLAND then remarked that,ashewas
not desirous of embanassing the pioposition of the
gentleman from New York, he would withdraw his
amendment, and submit it when lesolutions were
called for, as a separate proposition
Mr CAMPBELL, of South Carolina, then mo-
ved to strike out all after the word resolved, and in-
sert the following-
" That the Secretary of the Treasury be request-
ed to communicate to this House the aggregate
amount of public money received by, and loss sus-
tained through, the fiscal agents of the Government,
from the adoption of the Constitution to the present
tim«, discriminating between banks, Treasury offi-
cers, collectors of internal taxes, or other personal
agents of the Treasury, and excepting from his
statement the collectors of duties upon importations,
and the receivers of the sales of the public lands "
Mr C explained the object of ins proposition,
and after some remarks by Messrs LOOMIS and
PATTON, Mr CAMPBELL withdrew his amend-
ment
