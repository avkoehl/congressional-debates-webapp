Mr. PIKE. I rise now to close debate under
the rule.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman is entitled
to an hour.
ADMISSION OF ARKANSAS.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania. I ask the
gentleman from Maine to yield to me for a
moment. I have a bill which I am instructed
to report from the Committee on Reconstruc-
tion, and I wish to report it for the purpose of
having it printed and recommitted.
Mr. PIKE. I yield for that purpose.
Mr. MUNGEN. I object.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman has the
right to report from the Committee on Recon-
struction at any time, and the gentleman from
Maine has yielded the floor for that purpose.
Mr. STEVENS, of Pennsylvania, from the
Committee on Reconstruction, reported a bill
(H. R. No. 1039) to admit the State of Arkan-
sas to representation in Congress ; which was
read a first and second time, ordered to be
printed, and recommitted.
PROTECTION OP FISHING VESSELS AGAIN.
Mr. PIKE. Mr. Speaker, in the discussion
of the Navy appropriation bill, some days ago,
in the Senate, it was said that we needed an
increase of the Navy because of our increased
commerce. I have no doubt that the gentle-
man who made that statement believed in its
accuracy. Gentlemen familiar with the statis-
tics of this country know that our population
has increased with immense rapidity, varying
little in percentage from decade to decade,
running up each ten years more than one third
in amount of the preceding ten years. The
increase of general property in the country is
very much more in proportion than the increase
of our population, ami our manufacturing in-
terests everywhere, under the protection of
wholesome laws, have been constantly spring-
ing up, using our numerous water powers
throughout the land, and adding to their force
the illimitable power of steam. Agriculture
lias pushed its energies into every locality and
givea duplicate and triplicate receipts year by
year. Gentlemen familiar with the statistics
of these great industries naturally supposed
that commerce, the handmaid of agriculture,
enriching both, has participated in the general
prosperity. 1 wish it were so. But unfortu-
nately it is far from being the case.
I have taken some pains to examine the
statistics of the tonnage of this country as com-
pared with that of Europe, and I will briefly
submit the facts I have gathered to the House.
1 shall make but very few comments upon
them ; they speak in language much stronger
than any that I can use. I hold in my hand a
table exhibiting the tonnage owned by the
United States and Great Britain at different
periods. I have made it from the year 1810 up
to the last published statement in 1867:
Tonnage owned bp the United States and Great Britain
at different periods.

186 6 4,310,778 7,297,984
18S7.*v   4,256,017 no returns.
It will be seen that for a long period we kept
along with unequal steps with our great rival,
annually increasing our proportion until the
year previous to the war, 1800, when our ton-
nage nearly equaled that of Great Britain, and,
as matters were then running, in a few years we
should have reached and outstripped that coun-
try. The aggregate tonnage of these two great
commercial nations in 1860was eleven million
sixty-fourthousand eight hundred andtliirty-six
tons, divided about equally. At the last report
for the year 1866 the aggregate tonnage of the
two countries was about the same, but of it we
owned four million three hundred and ten
thousand seven hundred and seventy-eighttons
and Great Britain seven million two hundred
and ninety-seven thousand nine hundred and
eighty-four tons.
Although we have a statistical bureau with
a large force and amply paid, our statistics are
exceedingly imperfect. They do not exhibit
how much of this tonnage is engaged in the
home trade and how much in the foreign trade,
what proportion is in canal boats, what pro-
portion is in river steamboats, and what pro-
portion is in sea-going vessels. In these par-
ticulars our statistics are defective—much more
so than those of Great Britain.
We changed our system of tonnage four years
ago, and it is found on examination that we
are carrying along the old balance, so that the
four million two hundred and fifty-six thou-
sand and seventeen tons includes an old bal-
ance of about three hundred thousand tons
which exist nowhere except on paper. The
result is, making the proper allowances, Great
Britain to-day owns more than two tons to
our one.
InjyiWTtion to the statement I have made is
ihj^act that our tonnage includes the whole
our immense canal-boat tonnage, and all the
tonnage in the interior waters, while in Great
Britain they have no corresponding figures;
for the whole length of the canals of Great
Britain is but about four thousand miles, and
the whole tonnage in the "home trade" of
that country at the last report is but nine hun-
dred and sixty-one thousand one hundred and
three tons, while oifr whole tonnage with but
trifling exceptions, is engaged in the home
trade. They have no inland commerce as com-
pared with ours ; and our canal tonnage with its
six thousand miles of canals, of course greatly
exceeds theirs. Then, in addition to that, we
have an immense river commerce, of which
Great Britain has'but a trifling.amount. So,
then, this table shows the fact that whereas in
the year before the war we had nearly over-
taken Great Britain, and according to the
rate of progress we were making, in a short
time we should have passed her, to-day we
have less than half the tonnage that Great
Britain owns, and most of that is made up
of canal, river, and lake boats, and coastwise
tonnage.
I now give another table, which exhibits the
exports and imports of the three great com-
mercial nations of the world, England, France,
and the United States. I exhibit this table
for the purpose of showing the immense in-
crease of exports and imports of these great
countries:

In this table the pound sterling is reckoned
at five dollars, and the result given in round
numbers.
This table shows the work there is for ton-
nage to do. The increase of business is not
based upon population, for the population of
these countries has increased but moderately
between these dates; but rather based upon
the increase of wealth, and that is in almost
arithmetical proportion to the increase of rail-
roads in the several countries.
^ Now, I come to table No. 3, which is a very
interesting table to every American citizen. It
is a table exhibiting the Baltic and North sea
trade with the United States. It give;! our
exports to them and our imports from them
in American and foreign vessels:

I can give no later than 1866, because that
is the latest published returns, and although
I have applied for them, I have been unable
to obtain later returns from the Bureau of
Statistics. It is believed that the later re-
turns are still worse.
I turn now to table No. 4, exhibiting the
trade of the European Atlantic ports :

I believe the present exhibit would be still
worse than that here given, and that now the
imports from Europe to New York are nine
dollars in foreign vessels to one dollar in
American vessels, whereas forty years ago we
had nine dollars in American vessels to ono
dollar in foreign vessels.
I now turn to the Mediterranean trade—the
trade "up the Straits," as sailors call it—
where we formerly had a class of small vessels
of from two to three hundred tons engaged in
the fruit trade, just as fine specimens of naval
architecture as ever floated on the waters of
the ocean. Let me show you the statistics of
that trade to-day:
