Property in Territories—Mr. Davis.
Sen;
steadily increasing; and this applies not only to
the different kinds of iron and steel, or most of
them, and their manufactures, but it is equally
true of woolens and cottons. How, then, can it
be true that the iron interest is suffering, and the
forges, furnaces, and workshops are being closed,
when the tables show that our imports of iron are
becoming less every year, while our manufacture
and export of it are both increasing?
Gentlemen are extravagant in their eulogies of
the tariff of 1842, when by reference to the tables
it will be seen that the amount of revenue collected
under it was very small. Notwithstanding the
rates of duty were very high—in some cases
double the rates under the law of 1857—at the time
of the substitution of the act of 1846 for that of
1842, the latter was yielding not more than about
one third of the amount collected under the act of
1857; yet the actof 1842ismuchpraised, and that
of 1857 much censured, by those who are now en-
deavoring to substitute the pending bill for "it,
while the act of 1857 is furnishing nearly three
times as much revenue as that of 1842, with a
rate of tax upon consumption much smaller than
that of 1842.
[Here the hammer fell. Cries of "Go on!"]
Mr. HOUSTON. 1 will not trespass upon the
time of the House, if there be objection. I should,
however, like to occupy the time which was taken
from me by interruption.
Mr. SHERMAN". I object. The gentleman
from Alabama interrupted me in my speech yes-
tei'day as much as my colleague has interrupted
him to-day.
Mr. HOUSTON. I undcistand the chairman
of the Committee of Ways and Means to object
to giving mc the time which lias been taken from
me by interruption. I therefore offer as a substi-
tute for the bill that which I send to the Clerk's
desk. It has been printed.

PROPERTY IN TERRITORIES.
REPLY OF JiOJNT. JEFF. DAVIS,
OF MISSISSIPPI,
To the speech, of Senator Doiiglas,
. In the Senate, May 16 an:.' 17, 1860.
[revised by himself.r]
The Senate resumed the consideration of thore«o*litions
submitted by Mr. Davis on the 1st of Marefi, relative to
State rights the institution ofMaverymthe States, and the
rights of citizens of the seven! States m the Teiritoues.
Mr. Doughs having concluded his speech,
Mr, DAVIS rose and said:
Mr. P&ksxdent: When the Senator from Illi-
nois commenced his speech, he announced his
object to be to answer to an arraignment, or, as
he also termed it, an indictment, winch he said I
had made against him. He therefore caused ex-
tracts to be read from my remarks to the Senate.
Those extracts announce tliut I have been the

uniform opponent of what is called squatter .sov-
ereignty, and that, having opposed it heretofore,
1 was now, least of all,disposed to give it quaitur.
At a subsequent peuod, the fact was stated that
the Senator fiom Illinois and myself had been
opposed to each other on those questions which
I considered as mostdistinctly involvingsnuthern
interests in 1850. He has not answered to the
allegation. He has not attempted to show that
he did not stand in that position. It is true, he
has associated hnnself with Mr. Clay; and, before
closing, I will show that the association docs not
belong to him; that upon those test questions they
did ?K>t vote together. lie then somewhat vaunt-
ing xcizunded me that he was with the victori-
ous party; asseited that thi Democracy of the
country then sustained his doeinnc, and that 1
was thus outside of thatorganization. With Mr.
Clay! If ho had been with him, lie would have
beon in good company; but the old Jackson De-
mocracy will bo a little supWced to learn thntC'uy
was the loader of our party,and thataman pi ores
his allegiance to it by showing how closely he
followed in the footsteps of Henry Clay.
Statement exhibiting the principal articles imported into the United States during the fiscal year ending
June 30, 1859, subject to duty under the tariff act of 1857, bat made free under the proposed tariff of
JVfr. Morrill.
"When the Senator opened his argument, by de-
claring his purpose to be fair and courteous, I
little supposed that an explanation made by mo
in favor of the Secretary of State, and which could
not at all disturb the line of his argument, would
have been followed by the rude announcement
that he could not permit interruption thereafter.
A Senator has the right to claim exemption from
interruption, if he will follow the thread of his
argument, direct his discourse to the question at
issue, and confine himself to it; but if he makes
up a medley of arraignments of the men who
have been in public life for ten years past, and
addressing individuals in his presence, ho should
permit an interruption to be made for correction
as often as he misrepresents their position. It
would have devolved on me more than once, if I
had been responsible for his frequent references to
me, to correct him, and show that he misstated
facts; but as he would not permit himself to be
interrupted, I am not responsible for anything he
has imputed to me.
The Senator commenccd with a disclaimer of
any purpose to follow what he considered a bad
practice—of airaigning Senators here on matters
for which they stood responsible to their constit-
uents—but straightway proceeded to makeagen-
eral arraignment of the present and the absent. I
believe I constitute the only exception to whom
he granted consistency, and that at the expense
of party association, and, he would have it, at
the expense of sound judgment. He not only
arraigned individuals, but even States—Florida,
Alabama, and Georgia—were brought to answer
at the bar of the Senate for the resolutions they
had passed: Vngima was held responsible for
her policy; Mississippi received his critical no-
tice. Pray, sir, what had all this to do with the
question ? Especially, what had all this to do with
what he styled an indictment against him? It is
a mere resort to a species of declamation which
has not been heard to-day for the fust time—a
pretext to put himself in the. attitude of a perse-
cuted man, and, like the satyr's guest, blowing
hot and cold in the same breath, in the midst of
his complaint of persecution, vaunts his supiemu
power. If his opponents he the veiy small mi-
nority which he describes, what fear lias he of
peiseeution or proscription?
Can he not draw a distinction between one who
says, kt I give no quarter to an idea," and one who
pioclaims the policy of putting the advocates of
that idea to the sword? Such was lus figurative
language That figure of the swoid, however, it
seemed, as he progressed in his development, re-
ferred to the one thought always floating through
his biain—exclusion from the spoils of office; for,
at last, it seemed to narrow down to the supposi-
tion that no man wlm agned with him was, with
ourconsent, to be either a Cabinet officer or a col-
lector. Who has advaiifv d any such doctrine ?
Have I, at this or any other period ofmy acquaint-
ance with linn, done anything to justify him in
attributing that opinion to me? i pause for his
answer.
Mr. DOUGLAS. I do not exactly understand
the Senator. 1 have no complaint to make of the
Senator fiom Mississippi ot ever having been un-
kind or ungenerous towards me, if that is what he
means to say.
Mi. DAVIS. Ilave I ever promulgated a doc-
trine which indicated that, if my friends were in
power, I would sacrifice every other wing of the
Democratic party?
Mr. DOUGLAS. I understood the making of
a tost on this issue against me would reach every
other man that held my opinions; and, therefore,
if 1 was not sound enough to hold office, no man
agieeing with me would be; and hence every man
of my opinions would be excluded.
Mr. DAVIS. Ah, Mr. President, 1 believe I
now have caught the clue to the argument; it was
not befoie apprehended. 1 was among those who
thought the Senator, with his opinions, ought not
to ix« chairman of the Committee on Territories.
Tins, I suppose, then, is the whole imposition.
But have I not said to the Senator, at least once,
that 1 had no disposition to question lus Democ-
racy r that I did not wish to withhold from him
any tribute winch was due to lus talent and his
worth? O.d I not offer to r< simi the only chair-
manship of a committee I had, if the Senate would
