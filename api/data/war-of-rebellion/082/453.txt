GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,

No. 18. In the Field, near Hatcher's, Va., July 25, 1864.

I. The design adopted for the badge of this corps is the trace of a four-bastioned fort, of the pattern in the office of the chief quartermaster, and will be worn on the top of the cap or the side of the that by all the officers and enlisted men of the corps. The badge will be cut from red cloth for First Division, white cloth for Second Division, and blue cloth for Third Division. Commanding officers will see that requisitions are made to supply the troops in their respective commands, and that the badge is constantly worn.

II. The acting chief quartermaster will procure at once, by requisition or purchase, the cloth to supply the badge to divisions, and stencils to cut the cloth and also mark the transportation of the corps. The transportation will be marked with the letter in large size, and in the division color.

By command of Major General D. B. Birney:

ED. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
