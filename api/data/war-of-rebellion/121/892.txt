FORT MONROE, VA., March 21, 1866.

Major General NELSON A. MILES,

Commanding District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, VA.:

SIR: I would respectfully report that the health of state prisoner Jeff. Davis is not as good as at my last report. He is in a state of high nervous excitability; is complaining of fullness of the head and a tendency to vertigo. He seems to be wasting away gradually and losing flesh. This is scarcely perceptible to one who sees him day by day, but it is nevertheless certain.
