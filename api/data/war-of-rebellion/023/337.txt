rescals if they are entering. Twenty men of Boone's command escaped. Morgan not heard from since Colonel Miller surprised and killed part of his force at Gallatin. More than 3,000 twelve months' cavalry offered over what is authorized. How many regiments of three-years' infantry can I raise? Governor has sent me two regiments.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, August 14, 1862.

Colonel FRY, Huntsville:

In Rains' [formerly Stevenson's] brigade the regiments average 600 men. I do not believe that the average in the other regiments of Stevenson's corps is so much. I am satisfied that two trains of infantry troops arrived at Knoxville from Virginia within two weeks. I will at once send a scout near enough the railroad to obtain reliable information.

GEORGE W. MORGAN,

General.

CORINTH, August 15, 1862.

General BUELL:

I have ordered the divisions of Paine and Davis to Decatur subject to your order and two more divisions to hold the road to that point. I have directed the engineer officer to locate and plan fortifications and block-houses for the defense of the road. Another will expedite the forwarding of troops all he can. I will inform you of progress made in forwarding these troops day to day.

GRANT.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 15, 1862.

General HALLECK, Washington:

Governor Tod says he can send no troops to Kentucky until the middle of next week. That they should be sent without delay is of vital importance.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 15, 1862.

J. B. ANDERSON, Nashville:

Your assistants are not managing well. There is great delay and lack of economy in the use of the stock. Cars needed elsewhere are kept standing on the track loaded with cotton for several days as at Reynolds' Station. Please look at it.

D. C. BUELL.
