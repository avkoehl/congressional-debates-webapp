HARRISBURG, June 14, 1863-4. 30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The operators at Chambersburg and Hagerstown say contraband who now are coming in say rebels were coming into Martinsburg as they left at 12 o'clock to-day. From many who are coming-all tell nearly same tale. Line down between Winchester and Martinsburg about 11 o'clock this morning. Another dispatch says some contraband arrived report McReynolds to have been driven by a large force from Berryville to Bunker Hill and that public stores have been removed from Martinsburg.

PHILADELPHIA, June 14, 1863.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

If the telegrams just received from Hagerstown, that Martinsburg has been taken be the rebels at noon to-day, are true, the President should authorize the Governor to call out the militia to-day. It is the only way we can rouse and get our people out quick enough to check the movement of the enemy. Please answer.

THOMAS A. SCOTT.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Philadelphia:

We have intelligence that the enemy appeared at Martinsburg to-day, but General Tyler, who is there, has not reported any attack as yet, and telegraphic communication continues. Has not the Governor the right, under your State laws and constitution, to call out the militia of the State whenever he deems it necessary to do so? This Department has no objection to his doing so.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

Your telegram received. We have this afternoon intelligence from General Tyler, at Martinsburg, that the enemy have appeared there, but in what force he does not state. They are also at Winchester. It is certain now that there is a general movement toward Pennsylvania, although the rear of Lee's army is still south of the Rappahannock.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
