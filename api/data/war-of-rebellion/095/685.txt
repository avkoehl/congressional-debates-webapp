The captures of the Second Corps during the campaign were 35 guns, 16 flags, over 4,600 prisoners, and the capture or destruction of over 400 wagons and their contents.

Nothing could be finer than the spirit of the officers and men during all the operations of this campaign.

I beg leave to ask the attention of the commanding general to the services of Brevet Major-General Miles, whose division had the good fortune to be most frequently and heavily engaged with the enemy; but it would be an injustice to the other division commanders and their troops not to acknowledge the skill and bravery and fine spirit which they, in common with the First Division and its commander, exhibited throughout all the operations. For the prompt and intelligent manner in which all orders were carried out my thanks are dire to Brevet Major-General Miles, Brevet Major-General Mott, Brevet Major General Barlow, Brigadier-General De Trobriand, and Lieutenant-Colonel Hazard, commanding the Artillery Brigade.

To my staff-and especially to Lieutenant-Colonel Willian, Lieutenant-Colonel Whittier, Major Livermore, Major Bingham (wounded on the 7th instant), and my aides-de-camp-I am under many obligations for the active, zealous, and intelligent assistance they gave me.

Such brilliant successes have not been gained without severe loss, though comparatively small in number. Among those who fell are fell are Brigadier-General Smyth, in whom the service has lost a noble, gallant, and experienced soldier, and Major Mills, an accomplished, courteous, and gallant staff officer.

Among the wounded are Major-General Mott and Brigadier-General madill, both severely, and Brigadier-General MacDougall, Colonel Starbird, Nineteenth Maine, dangerously wounded.

For further details I beg leave to ask you attention to the reports of the division and artillery commanders, which accompany this.

I append hereto a statement of the number killed, wounded, and missing during the campaign.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. A. HUMPRHERYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac.
