Numbers 1. Reports of Major General Quincy A. Gillmore, U. S. Army, commanding Department of the South.*
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH,Morris Island, S. C., August 18, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report that I opened fire on Fort Sumter at daybreak yesterday, with a part of my heavy guns, and kept it up until dusk in the evening, with the exception of an intermission of a few hours during the heat of the day. The fire was resumed this morning and is now in progress. I am satisfied with the results thus far. The completion of my breaching batteries, which will be accomplished to-day, will enable me to increase the intensity of my fire fully one-third. The enemy employ the night time in piling up immense quantities of sand-bags against the gorge wall of the fort. Two monitors are also operating against Sumter.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.
