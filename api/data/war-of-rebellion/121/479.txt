Brigadier General BRADLEY T. JOHNSON,

Commanding First Prison District:

GENERAL: I am directed by Brigadier-General Ruggles, Commissary-General of Prisoners, to instruct you, in the execution of the duties devolving upon you commanding the First Prison District, to give your personal and special attention to that portion of the service immediately connected with the operations of General Lee's army in the field. The general desires that you make use of all available means to communicate by staff or other officers with General Lee, or with any officer who may be charged by him with the custody of prisoners of war who may be sent to the rear by him or under his authority, and to aid and facilitate their march to a safe prison station at Danville, or such other camp or station as may be found expedient to place them at, providing specially for their security and subsistence, and communicating, in case of emergency, in the absence of the general, with General Cooper, Adjutant and Inspector General, direct, and also to Colonel Robert Ould, commissioner of exchange, the number and designation of the prisoners, and sending a duplicate of the same to his temporary headquarters, at Salisbury, N. C. He desires you to take all measures practicable or necessary for the care and humane treatment of the prisoners, making your requisitions on the local staff departments, and if necessary, in cases of emergency, you can communicate with the Adjutant-General directly in his name, and also with the heads of other staff departments, with a view of obtaining whatever may be needed in the execution of this special service which is committed to your charge. The general will furnish you, on application, with any officers in his department who are not already assigned to duty. The general desires full and explicit information of the details of your operations.

Major Turner, commandant of the Libby Prison, at Richmond, was instructed by the general to accompany General Lee's army and receive such prisoners as might be turned over to him. He is placed under your command, and you will please communicate with him as early as practicable. In the event that you have not already done so, the general desires you to make similar arrangements with General Johnston and his army.

By order of General D. Ruggles:
