HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 13, 1864-12 m.

Brigadier-General WRIGHT:

I have seen your telegram to Major Duane. I have endeavored by orders and instructions and telegrams to explain that the object of the movement to-day was to ascertain if the enemy was in force in our front and to obtain some general idea of his position-in doing this the army corps co-operating to take such a position as would meet any advance of the enemy but with no intention of giving battle ourselves by advancing against the enemy's works.

MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 13, 1864-1.05 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The result of all the reconnaissance so far as I am informed are that the enemy has abandoned the advance position held by his right-falling back on a line in the general prolongation of that in front of General Warren's old position. The examination of some prisoners brought in recently confirms this theory. I propose taking up, as soon as General Ricketts returns, the line I held last night. It is pretty well intrenched and it will be made still stronger to-day. My left will join General Hancock's line, which he is also strengthening. I send this by an orderly instead of by telegraph in order to present the sketch below in illustration. The present artillery firing is on General Warren's front.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
