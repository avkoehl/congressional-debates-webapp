PEA VINE CREEK,

September 10, 1863-1.45 p. m.

Captain P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I encamp at this place, 5 miles from Ringgold. Van Cleve is with me in the valley, and I have sent back to General Wood to induce him to halt at Chickamauga Creek, 2 miles back. Upon arriving here, an hour ago, we found a small rebel force and drove them 2 miles. I had just called in my advance, when a cavalry force, variously estimated at from 300 to 600, charged one of Cruft's regiments and threw it into confusion. I have no report, but fear they took some prisoners.

We have positive information of a brigade of cavalry some 2 miles to the right and perhaps 3 miles to our rear. It is my opinion that our communication will be cut off within twenty-four hours after we cross, unless this force is driven off. Rumor indicates some force at Ringgold, but not large. I have Brigadier-General Hazen's dispatch this moment.* Please keep a copy of this for me.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIV., TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Camp at Pea Vine Valley, Ga., September 10, 1863.

Captain P. P. OLDERSHAW:

CAPTAIN: I am astonished to find by official report to-night that the disgraceful affair of to-day cost the First Kentucky Regiment 2 officers and 58 men. I reserve further comment until the coming in of Brigadier-General Cruft's report.+
