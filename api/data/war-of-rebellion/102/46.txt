OLATHE, April 6, 1865.

Major HEATH,

Provost-Marshal-General:

Bushwhackers are recruiting very fast, and commit depredations almost daily about Oxford and Little Santa Fe. Vaughan says they are plenty on Spring River. They are coming up as soon as leaves come out, when, to use his words, "they are going to make their support off Kansas. " Thirty men came up under Young about a week ago and are in the vicinity of Lone Jack. I would think one of those companies sent to Hickman Miles the other day would be of more service to our immediate border at Little Santa Fe instead.

W. F. GOBLE,

Lieutenant and Assistant Provost-Marshal.

JOHN WILLANS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
