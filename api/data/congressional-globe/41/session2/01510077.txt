Sir, take another instance. I have already
called your attention to the expenditures of
the Navy Department; now let me call your
attention to some other things. What is the
estimate of appropriations for the officers in
the Navy Department compared with the esti-
mates for the Navy, seamen and all, including
four thousand additional seamen ? On page
120 of the book of estimates will be found this
item:
" Pay of commissioned and warrant officers at sea,
on shore, on special service, and of those on tho
retired list and unemployed, and for mileage or
transportation of officers traveling under orders,
$5,000,000."
That is for the officers alone. Now, another
item is for—
" Pay of the petty officers, seamen, ordinary sea-
men, landsmen, and boys, including men for the
engineers' force, twelve thousand men, at an average
pay of $300 per annum, $3,600,000."
It should be added that the Secretary of the
Navy has since recommended a decrease in
the total amount above recapitulated to the
the extent of $1,000,000.
The amount for the officers is $5,000,000 ;
for the seamen and others, $3,600,000. Take
a single instance under your own eyes in the
Congressional Directory. Turn to the Con-
gressional Directory for the second session of
the Forty-First Congress, to the head " Navy-
yard, Washington," and see how many officers
are required, besides civil officers, to take
charge of this navy-yard. Count them as 1
read them over:
"Rear Admiral J. A. Dnhlgron, Captain T. II.
Patterson, Captain H. K. Davenport, Commander J.
Ii. Davis, Commander A. W. Weaver, Commander
