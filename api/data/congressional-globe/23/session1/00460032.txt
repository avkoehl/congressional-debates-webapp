of retrenchment The onl) piacticable means of
doing this wai the withdrawal of some of the im-
piovements which had been made, end on such
routes as would be least injurious to the public, and
lenst prejudicial to the revenues of the Depaitment

This, had th* imperfection of that system re-
mained unobserved, would have made the Depart-
ment appear to be less indebted, by that amount,
than what it is in reality.
This discovery of the excess of expenditures
In making these retrenchments many of the
principal contractors who were to be affected by
them, seeing the necessity which induced the meas-
uie, have readily declaied their cordial acquies
cence in it, and, with a patriotic spirit becoming
their character, have shown a determination to sus
tain the Department, as a paramount object, at any
sacrifices which it may require on their part.
After the reduction shall take effect, the annual
transportation of the mail will still be 25 527,957

Thus it will appear that but a part of the ira-
piovements will be withdrawn to enable the De-
partment still to rely exclusively on its own
resources, as the annual transportation will still
be, after the 1st January next, 1,902,936 miles,
.nioie than it was on the 1st July, 1832

THE LAND BILL.
The President's veto on this bill (which
we published in the Sentinel of yesterday)
will satisfy ever) disinterested mmd in the
community. The sketch given of the
manner whereby the United States were
first put in possession of these lands is m-
teiesting and judicious, and demonstrates
that they had onginallj been ceded specifi-
cally to pay the debt created by the rev-
í olutionary war, and as a source of revenue,
evidently, therefore, intended to constitute
an integral part of the national income.
i Can the income thus devoted to a special
purpose be alienated in good faith ?    Is
not it intended as a pait of the íevenue
of the United States in general, and not
foi the advantage of any State m pattic-
ular ? if the íevenup uerc thus despoiled
oi defalcated b} applying the lc-ouicrs
aiising fiom these public land-- to any
other purposes than th„t of supporting the
Geneial Government ol the Union, would
not the deficit thence ariM'ig con,pel an
impost of anothei Kind for a Mipply or
succedanoum ? How, then could it be
for the advantage of any Stafp oi States,
not desning d fraudulent piefrrence. lo
seek to despoil thegeneial íevenue in one
bnnch which must be compensattd by
some othei menus' And is not the íev-
pnue aiising horn public lands less op-
pressive m its being levied than almost
I any othei accessible bouice of levenuc ?
I But what light has any State to expect or
' demand a bonus or dividend of the net
pioceeds of the public lands levcnue,
which is joint, not individual, pioperty?
Even if a dividend vveie effected toi a
slioit penod for specific puiposes cf nii-
pioveiiient in some States, would that
alienation or dividend be constitutional, or
would it be expedient, since unfoitunately
expediency, not mtegnty or justice, has
become the oidei of the day >
No: let the revenue of the public lands
fonn an unalienable poilion of the levenue
of the Genei il Government, and let us
not degenerate into the absuid piaciiceof
lobbing Peter to pay Paul, for though our
revenue in this year is in happily flourish-
ing condition, we cannot hope for the same
suiplus funds in any subsequent yeai,
when the income aiibing from the reduced
scale of tanff duties will inevi'ably de-
crease those funda. So that it is much
better, being tlin  foiewained and fote-
armed, to maintain the fidelity ofthe general
revenue, to apportion ihe surplus funds
to meet ihe likely demands hereafter of
the General Government, and thus to ob-
viate the necessity of aoam resorting to an
excessive and oppressive inciease in the
tai iff duties—which has alieady alunated
the affections of many portions of the
Union, exposed the integrity of Congress
to plausible suspicion, and the mtegnty of
the Union to a contemplated lupture.
Theie have been two oi three fires in the
city lately, but the fiiemen put them out
so quick that we could learn nothing about
them. In no city in the vvoild, we wii'
ventme to say, does there exist a fue
depaitment so well dulled oi so active as
that of Cincinnati. Theie i« no chance
foi a fire when they take it in It mtK We
shrewdly suspect that they could have ex-
tinguished the late meteouc phenomenon,
if they had tried it.— Cincinnati Rep.
