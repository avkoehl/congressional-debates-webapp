HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,February 18, 1865.

Bvt. Major General A. S. WEBB,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The enemy's pickets have several times recently called to our men, requesting that some one who was a Mason come out to meet one of their number, with a view to their ascertaining, in what they conceive to be a reliable way, what disposition is made of men deserting to our lines. It seems that they are informed by their authorities that all such deserters are forced into our ranks, and that the orders in relation thereto, which they have been, are not observed. Believing that some good might result from such an interview in the way of increasing desertions from the enemy, I have the honor to request authority for sending a discreet officer upon this service.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
