SPEECH OF MR  MASON,
Of Virginia,
In the House of Rem esentatives, Oclobcr 11, 1837-—On the
bill " imposing additional duties, as dcpositones m cciuun
cases, on public olliccra '
The bill being under consideialion—
Mi MjifeON said Agreeing, as I moat coidially do in the
several measures which have so far been piesented by he Com
raittee of Way and Means for the consideration ot this House,
it is with the utmost reluctance that I am now biouglit to diftei
with tWt,v.ith whom I have huretolore acted
Ihibdtf'eience however I am pleased to consider, is at last
b it one of m etc expediency, andm itself contains nothing which

wibc intclli„cnce, reason, and sound judgment are alike hostile
to emite urn nraity, noi would oui lepresentative Goveinmert

of some ordained snpmoi, it the doctrine were allawed to hold
that party discipline exacts an unconsidered sanction to every
measuie ivlnch brings a recommendation, Horn the Lxecutive

Vich is certainly not the spirit of our institutions nor should
it be the spun of any paity that would act salely and wibely, or
even successfully, in the adnunistiation ol the Government

MvS objections to the.meisureb pioposed in this
hat the "íenot at all commen«uiate with the|cv£i8,
is bill are
encie  of
the times They do not meet the real difficulty Th  bjH
simply ordains that the Government, after tt limited time, will
receive nothing but gold and silvei in payment of public dues
and will entrust its keeping to its own officers alone Now, it
thcie were a creative power m our law, if by thissimpie-eiiact
ment the bank paper could he driven out of circulation back
whence it came, and the precious metals substituted in suffi-
cient quantities to meet the wants of soeiety, as well us the
demands of the revenue, the chief ground of my opposition
would be at once removed I can well see, from the experience
w  have had of the evil tendencies o( the banks to excessive
issues (and such, at piesent, are my decided impressions,) that
whenever the currency is placed in a condition to beat the
tribute the tiuc policy of Cfoveinment may be found to be to
exact its dues altogether m com, and to withhold its revenue,
while resting between its collection and its disbursement, from,
the use of the banks, as a fund to inciense their discounts
Myieasonsfortlns I will give hereafter, when treating of the
properposition which the Government may ultimately assume
towaid the State banks
The bill is to operate upon the currency as it now la, for we
have not only no guarantee that it will be found in an improved
condition at the end of twelve months, (the limited time,) but
is susceptible almost of demonstiation that one necessary con-
sequence from the proposed law will be to continue the cur
rency in its piesent debased condition
Ihe piecious metals, all will agree, are now banished from
circulation They are m the country, I grant you, and in
sufficient quantities, perhaps, to answer their accustomed duty
of circulating m those channels, below the reach of bank paper,
but they no longer p u  from hand to hand as a medium of
exchange Their formei exchangeable value has been con
vetted, by the course of trade to which I have alluded, to a
value exclusively maiketable, and thus they have fallen back,
and are entnely merged in the common and general mass of
merchandise Specie, whether in coin or m bullion, is now
merchandise, and not money, and those who require it foi any
puipose must go into the market and buy it at maiket latea, aa
they would do any kind of merchandise whatever How long,
theu, is this state of things to continue? How long will this
maiketable value attach, which detains the coin from us most
appiopiiate function as current money? And by what pioces-s
can it lie lebUired to cuculation'i
1 lie answer to the two first inquino is veiy simple Specie
will continue to be merchandise so long as theie exists any
demand lor it greatei than that which would invite oi letam it
in cuculation Itwasdnven out of circulation by tke demand
toi expoualion, aftei the business of the country had realized
the fact that our exports weie insufficient to pay for our im
pons '1 be balance must be met and the precious metals were
c die 1 out of circulation to answer this new demand It is a
neeessaiy and fundamental law of cunency, that where you
imvotvio media of whicb either answers all the puiposee of
exchange, and one of (hem, besides those purposes, will answei
another purpose as a subject of tiade, the latter will fly at once
to meet the new demand, and leave the duties ef cunency
exclusively to its fellow
So it was between the paper and the specie, when Uy the
exigencies of trade, the latter was suddenly called oft to meet
the new demand created by the necessity in commerce of extra
guishing the balances against our lmpoi ters There is no mys
tery in all this Impoits aie to be vdld for from two sources
alone by the produce and laboi of the importing nation, or fcy
cold and silver, and, whenever the foimei 13 found inadequate,
the precious metals must make up the deficiency
Thus stood the country when the banks suspended the paj
ment of specie They had an agency, and a large agency, I
giant you, m bunging that necessity about, pampering, as thsy
did, the pride of commei ce They met all its demands, honoi
cd all its drafts as well in the rage foi importation as 10 those
extravagant speculations to which the apparent prospentyol
the age gave immediate buth
Hut the banks are not alone to blame in th s It is due to the
occasion, and will aid us in searching out the true remedy
against a lecunence, to admit candidly and fairly that the Go
vei nment itself saw as little of the mischiefs that would follow
from the extension of the creditas the banks did themselves It
is a part of the history of the times and should bo lecoided on
the same page that when the deposites were given to the Sutt.
hanks they wei o expi essly msti tided to make them the basis ol
new incentives to commercial enterpii°ie
I do not speak this at all, sir in the spirit of rebuke—far, Very
fai fioni it ladduco it only to show that the Government it
self against whom, as some hive said, the banks have commit
ted the uupaidonable sin, was itself actively matuating them
to that veiy extension, now so zcdouily condemned How idi
the banks might have gone in cute-idm  then discounts tipo t
immense depo ite thus cast upon them vv ithout this amhon
tame mn , none can easily tell But it is fan and leasonablc
tomfei that tins license m advance did not pass unimproved
H mu" tatcd thus the actual condition of the currency, and
liuefiy trace Hhc causes winch have led to it, let us inquic
next v,hat will be the) tobible opeiat on ol a law that takes no
an ount of its enfeebled state, but peremptory demand, after
a „iven day, that the entire revenue, amounting to some twenty
millions of dolíais ,,ci annum, shall be j aid up in gold and sil
vni One nff-cssaiy consequence in my apprehension would
be effectually to plaeeit oat of the powei of the banks to resume
the payment of specie within any leasonable time How can it
beothmwise? lhey suspended payment because of the new
demand foi c in cieated by the exieencies ot tiade They
hive not yet resumed because although that demand has or
tamlY d mi u-hed as shown by the late of foreign exchange, yet
Un íe is still demand enough to warn them oí tl e consequences
i fan itlemptediesumptwii befoie the trade of the country win
a nt condition to beat ll Sir the «untry is ucovciiik rast
fi >m the v oknt and sudden convulsion into whiih it has been
lately tin ow n It cannot otherwise be, w hen v, e ci nsidei the
immense csomcos ot this vast continent wielded a they are

i,mii tliuithe veiv bounds ol the eaith But the Government
must keep its hands ofl-timo must be allowed tor the „yt,tem
to le act before any new or additional pre« uie can be boine
Ifthe necesemes of circulation are not s long enough now to
brine speciemtogeneral use as r art of the Currency, beeauseof
he existing collateral demand in tiade does it not necessarily
follow that any new demand will have an additional effect in
retarding that opeiation?
