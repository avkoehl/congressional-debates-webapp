HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Beaufort, S. C., January 10, 1865.

Honorable e. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have allowed the corps commanders of this army to raise a colored regiment each for pioneer work. The Seventeenth Corps has succeeded in raising about 800 men. I respectfully request the same authority to appoint officers for these organizations as that received by the commanding general Department of the South. The regimental organization is superior to the ordinary pioneer force, commanded by detailed officers, and is much better in point of economy.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

Major General F. P. BLAIR, Jr.,

Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I feel surprised, after the precautions that have been taken by yourself and officers, to find that many depredations have been committed near this place, and certain things done that would disgrace us even in the enemy's country, e. g., the robbing of some negroes and abusing their women. Please ascertain, if possible, approximately, the amount of damage wantonly committed on the island, and have it assessed on the brigade or regiment guilty.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
