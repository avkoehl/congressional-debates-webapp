HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 10, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

SIR: During the night I complied with orders by sending all of my reserve regiments to the left, placing them in position there. As these regiments are not my most reliable troops, and are taken from each brigade, and of course not properly organized for efficient service detached, I would suggest to the major-general commanding corps my preference to relieving all of the First Division, taking its front, thus allowing that division to move to the left. As at present arranged my brigades are disorganized and my command is not in hand.

I am, your obedient servant,

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General of Volunteers.

Major-General BIRNEY, Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding instructs me to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of this morning, and to say that it has all along been his understanding that you had a reserve brigade, or at least a portion of a brigade, regularly organized in reserve, as the other divisions had, and not that each brigade had regiments in reserve. A similar movement to this was effected the other day, when it was believed that the brigade sent by you to the left was an organized one. As such a movement was likely to occur again, it seems that it would have been better to have had such a brigade for that purpose instead of detached regiments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
