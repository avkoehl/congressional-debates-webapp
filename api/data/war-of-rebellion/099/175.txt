that purpose. General Littlefield has been instructed to take no men from any of the departments of the Army, those connected with the fire department of this city, nor those now engaged in the forwarding of supplies for General Sherman's Army, left behind by him; but he is not to refuse to receive any who present themselves and desire to be enlisted. If any trouble arises from men so presenting themselves for enlistment, in consequence of their service being required in the department where employed, their places must be supplied by able-bodied negroes who are now in the city, apparently idle. If necessary these men must be pressed into the service as laborers, &amp;c.

GENERAL: I am directed by the Major-general commanding to state that, having come to this city on his verbal orders for the purpose of enlisting negroes for the new regiments now being organized in this department, you will limit the enlistment somewhat until the supplies for Major-General Sherman's Army, left behind by him, are all forwarded, merely making preliminary arrangements for the purpose of opening recruiting offices in the city, when the enlistments will be vigorously pushed forward.

Commanding District of North Carolina, New Berne, N. C.:

GENERAL: Major-General Schofield, with the whole of the Twenty-third Corps, has been ordered east from Tennessee to operate in North Carolina, and is now on his way to Beaufort, N. C. His force consists of 21,000 effectives; you will at once prepare to receive them. General Schofield while operating in North Carolina is to have command of all the troops in that State. His operations will be directed up the railroad toward Goldsborough and Raleigh, and also probably toward Wilmington. I wish you to have as full and complete information as you can procure in respect to the enemy's force, condition of the roads toward Goldsborough, and the best way to get possession of the railroad without affording the enemy a chance to destroy it.
