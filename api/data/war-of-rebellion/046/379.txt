CHARLESTON, S. C.,

July 19, 1863 - 1 a. m.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Fort Sumter:

Morris Island must be held at all cost for the present. The commanding general directs Keitt's regiment to be thrown there to push any advantage before daylight; also nearest other regiment or battalion - Graham's or Nelson's, as most expeditiously moved. Cannot navy help with transportation?

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

CHARLESTON, S. C.,

July 19, 1863 - 1.30 a. m.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Fort Sumter:

I advise you (without seeing General Beauregard) to embark Keitt's regiment at once, and throw it on Morris Island. I will see him.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

CHARLESTON, July 19, 1863 - 2 p. m.

Brigadier General WILLIAM B. TALIAFERRO,

Morris Island:

Detailed telegram of events at Battery Wagner wanted from General Taliaferro. Re-enforcements on way to push advantage, if possible.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

CHARLESTON, July 19, 1863.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Fort Sumter:

What has Harrison's regiment effected? Troops thrown on Morris Island at once might strike an effective blow. Detailed report from Battery Wagner wanted up to latest moment.

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

[Addenda to Inclosure D.]

FORT SUMTER, July 19, 1863 - 6.35 a. m.

Brigadier-General JORDAN:

Keitt's people have not arrived. Do send the steamer over now with Graham's. Would risk her positively. Does General Beauregard order it?

R. S. RIPLEY.

FORT SUMTER, July 19, 1863 - 6.37 a. m.

Brigadier-General JORDAN:

The Sumter is here with Graham's regiment, but it is broad daylight, and she cannot land within 2,000 yards of the Ironsides and monitors. To send her over would be to trust to the enemy entirely. Shall I do it?

R. S. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.
