Numbers 188. Reports of General Joseph E. Johnston, C. S. Army,

commanding the Western Department, with congratulatory orders.

JACKSON, MISS., January 6, 1863.

General Bragg reports the enemy fell back from the field of battle to intrenchments, which he attacked and was repulsed. On hearing that the enemy was re-enforced, he fell back from Murfreesborough; not followed by the Federals.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

General S. COOPER.

JACKSON, January 9, 1863.

Colonel Ewell informs me, from Chattanooga, that on the 31st General Bragg had 35,000, including Wharton's cavalry. Lost 9,000; 3,000 sick, since, from exposure. We have not force enough here if the enemy is vigorous. Prisoners tell General Bragg of Federal re-enforcements from West Tennessee.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

The PRESIDENT, Richmond.
HEADQUARTERS, Jackson, via Montgomery, January 11, 1863.

I have just received the following dispatch from Colonel Ewell, Chattanooga:

The following is a summing up of what has been done, by the advice of General Bragg, since 1st of December, obtained unofficially, but directly from him, including Hartsville:

Morgan and Forrest have captured 5,500 prisoners, killed and wounded 2,000, destroyed stores and ammunition in immense quantities. Forrest has also fitted out his entire command in splendid style. Wheeler and Wharton captured 1,000 prisoners at Murfreesborough, and 4,000 more prisoners of war taken at the same place, and not less than 12,000 killed and wounded; total, 10,500 prisoners, and 14,000 killed and wounded; 10,000 small-arms, besides 2,000 distributed to our troops, and 30 pieces of artillery were sent to the rear, and 1,000 wagons, mostly loaded, were secured or destroyed, with a large number of mules and harness secured. The losses on our side were, at the most, 9,000 killed, wounded, and missing, and four pieces of cannon.

J. E. JOHNSTON.

General S. COOPER.

GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS,Numbers 4. Chattanooga, January 28, 1863.

General Johnston has great satisfaction in expressing to this command his sense of the high services and admirable conduct of the Army of Tennessee, especially in the recent operations near Murfreesborough. In those operations that patriotic army, contending with greatly superior numbers, by its own courage, and the skill of its general, inflicted upon the enemy a loss almost equal to its own number, besides capturing thirty-three cannon and a thousand wagons-and exploit unparalleled in modern battles. For its heroic fortitude in enduring fatigue, privation, and exposure, and bravery in battle, he can, with confidence, promise to it the thanks of the Government and gratitude of the country.

By command of General Johnston:

BENJ. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
