GEO. W. NEFF,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

CAMP DENNISON, July 14, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

The main force has not crossed entirely. There is a road leads off from the road to Loveland, which circles the east side of the camp. I will endeavor, as soon as possible, to find out which road they take. The great difficulty is the country around here is cut up with roads. It is hard to tell what their intentions are. They have their artillery in position, bearing on the camp, on the north side of a hill. Their intention may be to burn the railroad bridge.

NEFF,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

CAMP DENNISON, July 14, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

The guide who brought Morgan through from Sharonville, on the Lebanon pike, was picked up by Captain J. Piatt, who learned from him that at 1 o'clock last night he was pressed into John Morgan's service as guide, Morgan informing him that he must take him through as direct a road as possible eastwardly; that he must make the road to Maysville short. The guide having, in the opinion of Morgan, taken a circuitous route 1 mile south of Montgomery, he pressed in a fresh guide, still carrying with him the old guide, crossing the Little Miami at Miamiville, or a short distance above there. They will probably strike the Milford to Goshen pike at or near what is called Newberry, in Clermont County. It was understood by the guide, whom he told to go about his business after paroling him, that they would take supper at Batavia, Clermont County; from there is a good turnpike leading to Richmond, Ohio, and other good roads leading to Ripley and Maysville, Ky. There is no doubt that forces between what is called Amelia, Clermont County, and Bantam would head Morgan to-night.

GEO. W. NEFF,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
