would probably be kept at or about the headquarters of the commanding general, and under his orders; that authority was given to raise a regiment, and the men were so informed; that companies B, C, D, E, F, and G were mustered into the United States service by Captain Hastings, of the First U. S. Cavalry, and the other companies by Captain Bush, of one of the new regiments of United States infantry, and that possibly there may be 20 men who have not been mustered into the United States service; that the regiment was well armed and mounted; that no complaints were made of false enlistments, of inexperienced or incompetent officers, of poor arms, or of different organization and duty from what was promised, until arriving at Nashville, Tenn., but that when at Carlisle, Pa., meeting with delay in getting off for Louisville, there was manifested some dissatisfaction because it was reported the Governor wished to retain the regiment for service in the State and the men were anxious to join the army in the West; and while at Louisville, Ky., some complaints were made for fear the regiment would be brigaded, uniformed, and discharge the duties of regular cavalry. It is also stated that while at Louisville, and en route thence to Nashville, squads of the men visited disloyal families, and reported to them their grievances, and exhibited a disposition to refuse or avoid doing a soldier's duty. They were advised of the impropriety of such practices, and admonished that, if they persisted in a refusal to do duty, they would be arrested and punished, to which they replied they dared any general in interfere with their rights; that they had money and influence, which would secure them their rights, discharge, &amp;c. On the march from Louisville to Nashville, they generally performed very well their duty, which, from the circumstances and inclement weather, was somewhat arduous and disagreeable. The regiment arrived at Nashville December 24, 1862. On the next day a foraging party was sent out, which had a skirmish with the enemy, in which 1 man was lost. That night there was considerable excitement, and complaints made that their officers were inexperienced and incompetent. Officers who have had experience in the service state that the officers of this regiment will compare favorably with any in the volunteer service. There was at this time evidently much disaffection and demoralization, and a decided objection to do duty, and a determination to be disbanded or discharged, and pretexts sought to justify acts which their dispositions prompted. Insufficiency of officers and incomplete organization were given as reasons for disobeying orders; also that they had been so often and much deceived they did not know who to believe. Their mode of complaint and redress, instead of being through the ordinary military channels, was by caucuses and committees, &c.

On the morning of December 26, 1862, Major General W. S. Rosecrans, commanding the Department of the Cumberland, moved his forces to the front from Nashville, Tenn., to attack the enemy. Some 200 of the Anderson Cavalry, more or less, and all the officers, except Lieutenant G. S. Fobes, acting regimental quartermaster, left in charge of regimental property and the camp, obeyed the order, and moved with the army.* The remaining portion of the regiment refused to go. Brigadier General R. [B.] Mitchell, commanding at Nashville, Tenn., on the 27th of December, 1862, addressed a communication to Lieutenant Fobes, urging the Anderson Cavalry to the front, to assist their comrades in conflict with the enemy in this (their) our country's hour of peril, but without avail. (See papers herewith submitted and marked C and D.) The portion refusing to go to the front objected upon the ground of insufficiency of officers and incomplete organization.
