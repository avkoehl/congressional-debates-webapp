Some gentlemen have been pleased to place
their claims upon the mechanical or boat-building
interest. If this be a just cnteuon.and the claims
of New York and Pennsylvania be tested upon
this principle, to which I have no objection, New
York will still be entitled to the prize, to show
which, see the following table:

I am not disposed to find fault with the Repre-
sentatives of Pennsylvania, because they advo-
cated the lnteiests of their State, and place the
claims of Philadelphia upon its most favorable
footing; nor have 1 presented these statements to
draw an invidious distinction between the two
cities; but have thought it my duty, as one of the
Representatives of the great State of New Yoik,
to stand up for her inteiests, and theieby, in my
humble opinion, subserve the public interest by
advocating the construction of a diy-dock at the
Brooklyn navy-yard.
But why should I say anymore upon the sub-
ject. Has not the honorable chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means told the House
that this is merely a reappropnation of a sum of
money, carried to the surplus fund, which had
been appropriated to the building of a diy-dock
at Bioolclyn, after mature consideration by the
last Congress; but owing to some difficulty in
procuring the land ata moderate puce, it had not
been applied to this object. The same difficulty
does not now present itself. The claims of the
several places now contesting, had been fully
examined by tbat Congress which made this
appropriation. The palm had been yielded to
Brooklyn. This had been done, too, upon pro-
per surveys. Will gentlemen withhold the just
claims of New York, and thereby mjuie the pub-
lic service, because they cannot get dry docks
established in every section of the country, where
ever their imaginations may lead them to believe
they are needed ? This would be not only unjust,
but highly censurable.
Upon what ground are the fuends of Philadel-
phia disposed now to place her claims ? Upon
superionty of haibor' I should suppose not; foi
the haibor of New York is one of the best in the
woild—perfectly secure, affording good anohoi-
age to any number of vessels. It can float the
largest vessel in our Navy.    It is only two hours
sail from the ocean; whilst that of Philadelphia
is insecure and contracted, and at least one pan-
died and fifty miles from the ocean.
New Yoik can be appioached at all seasons of
the year.and vessel&repairedatany time; but ice
in the Delaware renders it impracticable to get to
Philadelphia. But the greatest obstacle which
presents itself is as to the depth of water, which
is not sufjicient to float our laigest vessels. The
great object of a dock of this kind is to íeceive ves-
sels without reference to size, with their crews,
armament, and munitions on boaid, and thus
lepair them, and save the tiouble of removals
of the same, as has to be done in the ordinary
way. And if there be not sufficient depth of
water at Philadelphia for this purpose, the dock
would be totally useless. There has been no in-
formation furnished to this House of actual sm-
vey, &c , that will disabuse our minds of this
opinion.
New Yoik is entitled to tins dry-dock, whether
we consider the security and capacity of harbor,
depth of water, its proximity to the ocean, ton-
nage, impoits and expoits, revenues, taxes—in
fine, her general commercial, agricultural, or me-
chanical inteiests. And whilst I am speaking of
hei comroeice, I will present one fact in relation
to that of Philadelphia. The aruval of foreign
vessels into Uie poit of New Yoilc has progres-
sively incieased for the last fifty yeais; whilst it
appeals, fiom statistics upon this subject, lately
published, that the foieign amvalsinto Philadel-
phia, at the present time, aie not moiethan they
weie in 1788. But its coasting tiade has consid-
eiably incieased, but I think not in the same
proportion as that of New Yoik
The mechanics of New Yoik are as skillful,
and laboi is as cheap, if not cheapei, than at
Philadelphia, and the facility of piocunng build-
ing materials for vessels isas gieat. But, above
all, the public interest demands that New York
should have it.    Why, then, withhold it?
I have also prepaied a statement of the opera-
tions of the two cities in gold and silvei for a
period embiacing eight years, from 1831 to 1838,
both inclusive:
NEW YORK CITY
ter claim for future disbursements there than the
places above- cited.
To conclude, sit, it is with pleasuie thji' I re-
cur to the healthful s.ta' e of prosperity which New
York now presents. The Representatives of thiso
great State, can with pude say, she has within
her precincts the main artery of the Union; that
she diffuses the life's blopij through the whole
commercial system,, as the foregoing statistic*
irrefutably establish the fact. We are proud that
she is so—not from local, narjqw views, but be-
cause she tends so much to add to the honor and
fame of the whole United States. I go for my coun-
try, su, and that which will best benefit it m this
aggregate, and whenever I am satisfied of the
uiihly of an appropnation in a national ppint of
View, I will ever be found íeady to record my vote,
in its favor, let it be at the North or the. gouth 
the East or the West, and all I ask is, tljat gen-
tlenjen would legislate on equally liberaL prince
pies, which I have no doubt that they will.

But to return to the ciy of some gentlemen as
to the inequality of expenditmes. I think New
Yoik pays as much (if not more) into the public
Treasuiy, in the way of taxes, having reh íence
toilet population, as.any other ¡state in the Union
Have the disbursements, upon the same pnnei-
ple, been greater in this State than in other sec-
tions of the Union, and patticulatly Pennsylva-
nia' I think not. The building at New York—
the custom-house — which the Goveinment is
erecting for its own accommodation, has been íe-
feried to by gentlemen who are in favor of erect-
ing this dock further south. They have, with
great emphasis, denominated it a palace, a waste
of money, &c. This was not erected solely, let
me tell gentlemen, with a view of beautifying
New Yoik. It has been constructed of perma-
nent materials, and of great capacity, such as the
interests and wants of the Government demanded.
I hope all objection will vanish when I tell gen-
tlemen that the election of the same has cost
the Government but one per cent upon the rev-
enue neted at that portfoi the last ten years, and
I very much question whether Philadelphia, with
her splendid Mint and navy-yard, or any other
section of the countiy, can present the same pic-
tuie as a justification foi the amounts they have
received of the bounties of the Government. I
think, all told, that New York can present a bet-
Report on the state of the Treasury ai d Ei-
penditures of tl e Government.
In the House of Representatives, January 24,
1839., Mr. Cambreleng, fiom the Committee of
Ways and Means, submitted the following report
on the state of theTieasuryand the expenditure 
of Government:
By the C3d íule of the House of Represent-
atives, it is made the duly of the Committee of
Ways and Means to " inquire into the state of
the revenue and of the expenditure, and to re-
poit, fiom time to time, their opinion thereon."
The cpndition of our finances renders the dis-
charge of this duty particularly necessary at the
piesent time. Our extraordmaiy expendituies,
have, within a few yeais, been unavoidably
larse, and ourievenue has rapidly declined since
1836 In that year our income from customs and
lands was moie than forty-eight millions, in 1837
(including the postponed bonds) it was about
twenty four millions; and for the past yeai (de-
ducting the postponed bonds) about foui teen mil-
lions and a half. The levival of tiade will met ease
the revenue both from customs and lands, and
notwithstanding the progiessive reduction in our
tariiT, it will probably be sufficient to meet the
wants of an economical administration pf our
Government. We have, howevei, no just reason
, to anticipate such an excess of levcnue as to woi-
lant a continuance of extravagant expendituiesj
and the piesent íeduced state of the Tieasury af-
foids a propei occasion to inqune what branches
of these ha\e been unnecessary increased, and
to ertdeavoi to restoie the aggiegatg expense of
the Tedeial Government to the economical basis
contemplated by the act of the 2d of Maich, 1833,
and conesponding with the maximum duty of
twenty pel cent ad uaioremaftei June, 1842, pro-
posed by that act.
1 Oui IVdeial expenditures have been lapidly,
though niegularly, increasing, fiom 1789 to the
piesent time. The fluctuations appear to have
been simultaneous with an increasing or decreas-
ing ievenue, an oveiflowing Tieasuiy uniformly
' pioducing a sudden augmentation of our appro-
priations     Independent, however, of such occa-
| sional extia-vagancc, it was natuial to anticipate,
I especially in the fit st half centuiy of its existence,
a steady increase in the civil, military, and naval
expenditures of a Govei nment which had no such
establishments at its origin; and particularly in a
| country which has in so short a period doubled
I the number of States m the Confederacy, enlarged
its boundaiy of settlement to near five times its
extent in 1790, increased its population fiom less
than four to near seventeen millions,and extended
its post ioutes fiom eighteen hundied and sev-
enty-five to near one hundred and thirty-five thou-
sand miles.
| But, while a consideiable mciease of our ex-
pendituieb for pui poses strictly national—for the
common defense and common goveinment of a
lapidly giowing an 1 now enlaiged ConfeJciacv—
maybe satisfactory accounted for, if not enuieiy
justified, by the cucumstances, othei expendí
tures, foieign, as youi committee believe, to the
onginal design of the Constitution, have alisen
1 through a depaituie fiom the puneiple of taxation
