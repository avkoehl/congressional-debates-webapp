Mr. THAYER. I am instructed by the

to report it baek without amendment; and as
it will occupy but a minute or two, I ask for
its consideration now.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in

sider the joint resolution. It authorizes and
directs the Secretary of War to place at the

in store at the Rock Island arsenal, to be
placed around a large and beautiful lot in

explained. The resolution does not state what
lot this is on which the cannon are to be
