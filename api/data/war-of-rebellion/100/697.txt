HEADQUARTERS, March 26, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL; Last night I left your order for Colonel Lipscomb to remain where he was till further orders, and to send to Sixth North Carolina Regiment to me to-day. I have heard nothing directly from Colonel Lipscomb, but I am told that he has crossed the Neuse, going toward Fayetteville. I beg you to order the Sixth North Carolina to report to me at once that I may get this regiment together. Unless this is done the regiment will not be fit for service this campaign.

Very respectfully, yours,WADE HAMPTON,

Lieutenant-General.
