HEADQUARTERS, Saint Louis, September 28, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK,Washington:

Information up to date shows the enemy in considerable force concentrated at Fredericktown. Have moved thence and attacked Pilot Knob, seized the railroad as far up as Mineral Point, and cut off our communication at Pilot Knob. General Smith confronts them at De Soto. All our available cavalry at this end of the State is with General Smith. We are organizing the militia and citizens of Saint Louis. Sanborn is moving with all his mounted force to Rolla, leaving a strong garrison at Springfield, where all public property is carefully bestowed. Current reports among rebels are that Price intends reaching the Missouri River. Troops have been ordered from Illinois to assist us. Pilot Knob has a garrison of 1,400 men, twelve pieces of artillery, and plenty of provisions.
