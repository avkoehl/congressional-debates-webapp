Refunding of Cotton Tax—Mr. Bright.
Ho. of Reps.
orange! It would be a thousand-fold easier
for the Government to restore it from its burst-
ing coffers than'for the producers to lose it in
their destitution.
Gladly would I turn from the sad vision
of our southern section 1 Beaten, broken,
crushed; desolate, friendless, forsaken ; sit-
ting like a wailing widow in the dust; discon-
solate, shriveled with famine, only the skel-
eton of her former self. Paint and languid
she commenced the struggle for bread for her
hungry and clothing for her naked. No sooner
did hope gild the dawn of the future with re-
turning prosperity, than it began to darken
with the shadow of a coming evil. The cotton
tax, vulture-like, worked upon her for three
long years, and long will she bear the marks
of the scourge. It is a question not only for
to-day, but for the generations. If Congress
may concentrate the taxing powers of the
Government, and pour the burning focus upon
a single staple production, then all her theories
of the Constitution will be subverted and her
despair riveted. Rather let this measure be
marked as an era of reconciliation, peace, and
fraternity. We, the living, are but atoms
floating in the sunbeams of an hour; the years
belong to posterity. In humanity let us save
them from our dissensions, nor let us transmit
to them the virus of our distemper. If we
cannot heal our feuds, they will live in them.
The moral basis of our Government is every-
thing. The foundation principle of all stable
government is the affection of the people.
The heartstrings of the people are the strongest
ligaments of our Union. With the affections
all right, grievances will never appeal in vain
to the tribunal of justice.
. May we yet see the North and the South
heart-linked in the old bridal vow of the Con-
stitution, and every citizen feel " that we have
all of us one human heart."
APPENDIX.
Annual value of the principal agricultural products
of the nation in 1869, prepared by Commissioner
Wells—Report, 1869, pp. 15-16.
An estimate of the value of the loading agricul-
tural products of the country for the present year
may also tend to assist in forming a judgment in
regard to the total annual value of the product in
this department of national industry. The details
of such an estimate would be somewhat as follows:
Cotton, 2,700,000 bales, 450 pounds each, at twenty-
five cents  $303,760,000
Corn, 900,000,000 bushels, at fifty cents... 450,000,000
Wheat, 300,000,000 bushels, at $1 25  375,000,000
Oats, 275,000,000 bushels, at fifty cents.... 137,500,000
Wool, 177,000,000 pounds, (estimated clip
of 1868.)atforty-twoanda half cents... 75,225.000
Tobacco, 225,000,000 pounds, at sixteen
and a half cents  37,125,000
Barley, 25,000,000 bushels, at $1 20.  30,000,000
Hay, 25,000,000 tons, at ten dollars  250,000,000
Kye, 25,000,000 bushels, at$l 10  27,500,000
Hides, 6,700,000, at $5 50   36,850,000
Potatoes, 150,000,000 bushels, at sixty
cents  90,000,000
Buckwheat, 20,000,000 bushels, at $1 00.. 20,000,000
Flesh of animals, deducting value of hay
and grain consumed  400,000,000
Dairy products, deducting value con-
sumed of farm products previously
enumerated  400,000.000
All other productsof agriculture, includ-
ing the animal increase in the value
of cattle and horses; the value of fruits,
seeds, and garden products; the an-
nual addition to the value of farms
and farm buildings, and implements
made by farm labor not elassed as
mechanical, (fences, drainage, &c.)  650,000,000
Total ' $3,282,950,000
Recapitulation.
[From same report, page 20.]

leading industries of the country would therefore
appear to be substantially as follows:
Agriculture   
Cotton manufacture  71,500,000
Woolen manufacture....... 
Iron production, pig and bar  110,950,000
Leather manufactures  222,600,000
