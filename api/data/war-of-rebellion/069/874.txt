HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,June 4, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR,

Richmond, Va.:

SIR: Last night, after the date of my dispatch, Generals Breckinridge and Finegan were attacked by the enemy as they were preparing to re-establish their skirmish line. The enemy was soon repulsed. Immediately afterward an attack was made upon General Hoke's front, with a like result. Up to the time of writing nothing has occurred along the lines to-day except skirmishing at various points. The position of the army is substantially unchanged.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

I have ordered Ransom's brigade to move at daylight if no hostile demonstration is made during the night.
