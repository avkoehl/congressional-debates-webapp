General D. W. LINDSEY,

Captain Cockrill can remain. No necessity for him in Owen or Henry Counties. Troops now there. If he can hear of Sue Munday's gang, it will be well for him to look after her.

Brigadier-General HOBSON:

The balance of Twelfth Kentucky will be ready to move this evening. If you know in what way rebels are moving I can send Twelfth Kentucky to head them off. Let them know.
