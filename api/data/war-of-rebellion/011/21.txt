about New Madrid being overflowed, I have ordered his main body to be withdrawn and sent up the Tennessee. We must pierce the center of the enemy's new line somewhere below Florence. As Savannah is near the railroad and between Corinth and Henderson, I have directed the landing to be made at that place, unless General Smith, from local information, should deem some other point preferable. I have sent intrenching tools, and shall push forward re-enforcements as rapidly as possible.

SAINT LOUIS, March 8, 1862.

Major General U. S. GRANT, Fort Henry:

You are mistaken. There is no enemy between you and me. There is no letter of yours stating the number and position of your command since capture of Fort Donelson. General McClellan has asked for it repeatedly with reference to ulterior movements, but I could not give him the information. He is out of all patience waiting for it. Answer by telegraph in general terms.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

FORT HENRY, March 9, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Your dispatch of yesterday is just received. I will do all in my power to advance the expedition now started. You had a better chance of knowing my strength whilst surrounding Fort Donelson than I had. Troops were reporting daily, by your order, and immediately assigned to brigades. There were no orders received from you until the 28th February to make out returns, and I made every effort to get them in as early as possible. I have always been ready to move anywhere, regardless of consequences to myself, but with a disposition to take the best care of the troops under my command. I renew my application to be relieved from further duty. Returns have been sent.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
