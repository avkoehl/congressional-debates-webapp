HDQRS. DEPT. OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN.,Dublin, November 28, 1863.

Honorable A. T. CAPERTON:

SIR: I received yesterday your letter of the 26th. I am fully aware of the importance of having additional troops in my department, and especially of having an adequate force to prevent the enemy from penetrating into Botetourt and Rockbridge. I have repeatedly asked for re-enforcements, and shall do so again whenever I think that there is the slightest possibility that they can be procured. At present I regret to say that I can get none.

For reasons not necessary now to mention, I cannot send any more of my own troops to Greenbrier. At this late season of the year I do not think the enemy will move into Greenbrier for the purpose of occupying the county, and I hope and believe that we can prevent any raiding party from penetrating into Rockbridge and Botetourt.

I shall be glad if you will ascertain and inform me what cavalry cmmitted the depredations you mention on your own property and that at the Red Sweet Springs, that I may have reparation made and the officers commanding punished.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
