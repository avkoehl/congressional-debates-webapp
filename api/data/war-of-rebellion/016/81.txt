Numbers 90. CENTREVILLE, August 31.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

DEAR GENERAL: Your dispatch of 11 a. m. has been received, and I that you for considerate commendation. I would be glad to have it in such shape that the army might be acquainted with it. We shall fight to the last. The whole secession army engaged us yesterday. I had a letter from Lee this morning. Ewell is killed. Jackson is badly wounded, and other generals of less note wounded. The plan of the enemy will undoubtedly be to turn my flank. If he does so he will have his hands full. My troops are in good heart.

I need cavalry horses terribly. Send me 2,000 in lots and under strong escort. I have never yet received a single one.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General.

Numbers 91. HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Camp near Centreville, September 1, 1862-3 a. m.

Major-General SUMNER:

The reconnoitering party of cavalry which you sent out yesterday morning, under Captain Hight, has, as I am informed, been captured by the enemy's cavalry. It is essential that your right be carefully watched. I desire you at daylight to push a reconnaissance of not less than one brigade, supported, if necessary, by a second, toward the north of your position, to the Little River turnpike and beyond. The direction of your reconnaissance should be as nearly due north as practicable, and hold be pushed not less than 5 miles. It is of great importance that this reconnaissance should be made at an early hour in the morning. The orderly whom you sent to me left me without permission, so that I find it very difficult to find your headquarters. Please send him back.

JNO. POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
