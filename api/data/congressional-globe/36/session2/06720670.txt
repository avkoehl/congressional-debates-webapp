THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 31,
sheba; which the people in the cotton States have
.warred on; and which they have declared was
worse than Sewardism; for it had hypocrisy, and
the other was bold and open. It was a petty-
larceny, pick-pocket sort of policy, while the
other was the open, foot-pad " stand and deliver."
That is just the truth about the matter, and he
knows it; but yet lie brings this policy up here.
The apple of discord is offered to us as the fruit
of peace.
Now, I am in the habit of saying just what 1
think, and just what I choose to say; and I do
not choose to have this matter discussed in these
general terms here any longer, so far as I am con-
cerned,and beheld upasadisunionistandodious
to the country, when I know that men here who
have produced all the difficulty have offered no
means of reconciliation. These are facts. He
says we do not want a settlement, and will not
i'oin the patriotic men in settling the difficulties.
say I will. I say that I will vote for any prop-
osition to-day, will do it to-morrow, will do it
until I leave the Senate, provided itgives us what
we arc entitled to under the Constitution; and I
ask nothing more; and that I will advise the peo-
ple whom 1 represent to stay their hands and to
wait, if there is a reasonable prospect of that prop-
osition being ratified by a sufficient number of
States north of Mason and Dixon's line to make
it a part of the Constitution. I am willing to do
that. You say that my proposition is impracti-
cable; that I am demanding more than I am en-
titled to. I answer, that it is not so; the Consti-
tution of the United States recognizes the right of
man to own property in man; the Constitution
kept open the slave trade for twenty years; pro-
hibited cither Congress or the States themselves
from stopping it during the first twenty years.
The first treaty we ever made with England
declared that slaves were property, and provided
for their being delivered up. So did the first treaty
wo ever made with an Indian nationâ€”with the
Delawares. Even in treating with savage nations,
wc stipulated expressly that slaves should be de-
livered up, recognizing slaves as property. ISy
our treaties, by our legislation, by our Constitu-
tion, slaves are recognized as property; but this
lias been denied by the Republican party; and the
Senator from Illinois says," I am unwilling to say
whether it is property or not; all I ask is non-
intervention; we will not protect it; we will not
confiscate it; and you are an impracticable dis-
unionisst, a traitor, if yon do notagrec to my com-
promise, because it is a great principle, and it was
in the Nebraska-Kansas bill." Whatever was
in the Nebraska-lvansas bill is a great principle,
and, of course, we ought to be satisfied with it.
Now, sir, I got him on the witness stand, and
began examining him, but he is hard to keep there;
you cannot huld that Senator to anything. I am
done, unless he should reply.
Mr. LATHAM. I ask now that the motion
may be put which I nnule at one o'clock.

bers of the message of the President, and make it

COMPROMISE RESOLUTIONS.
Mr. NIXON. I ask the unanimous consent
of the House to presenttlie preamble and resolu-
tions of the Legislature of the State of New Jer-
sey, upon the proper measures to be taken by Con-
gress for the pacification of the country. These
resolutions come from a gallant and conservative
State, ever faithful to all her constitutional obli-
gations, and should reccivc the attention of the
House. In so far as they do not indicate any
particular mode of adjustment, and express the
general wish that Congress shall adopt some plan
which will permanently settle the whole contro-
versy about slavery, I bolicve that they express
the wishes of a large majority of the people of
New Jersey, without rcspect to party.
The resolutions were laid on the table, and
ordered to be printed.
FALSE STAMPS, ETC.
Mr. MOORHEAD. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House to have House bill No. 330

which the constituents of every gentleman are
interested; and I hope there will be no objection.
The bill, being a bill to prevent and'punish
fraud in the use of false stamps, molds, dies,
brands, labels, or trade-marks, was read for in-
formation.
Mr. NOELL. The General Government has
nothing to do with the punishmentof that crime;
and I sliall object to taking up the bill.
Mr. MOORHEAD The gentleman's constit-
uents have petitioned very largely for that bill.
Mr. NOELL. I would have no objection to it
if the General Government had any power over
the subject.
Mr. MOORHEAD. It is necessary for the
security of commerce.
Mr. McKNIGIIT. I appeal to the gentleman

from the Committee on Commerce, a bill to reg-
ulate the compensation of the keeper and assist-
ant keepers of the Minot Ledge light-house, and
for other purposes; which was read a first and
second time.
Mr. ELIOT. I ask that the bill may be put
upon its passage; and I beg leave to say that its
passage is called for by the wants of the light-
house, and is recommended by the Department
here. No money is aaked for. It is necessary
to have three keepers, and the bill docs not enlarge
the compensation in consequence of the appoint-
ment of the third keeper.
No objection being made, the bill was ordered
to be engrossed and read a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third time,
and passed.
