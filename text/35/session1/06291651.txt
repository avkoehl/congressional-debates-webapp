engineers of the united states navy.
Mr. FLORENCE, from the same committee,
also reported a bill for the relief of engineers in
the United States Navy.
Mr. LETCHER. Is that a private bill ?
Mr. FLORENCE. Yes. It is to relieve cer-
tain engineers. It is a private bill, general in its
details.
The SPEAKER. The phraseology of the bill
is that all engineers of the Navy of the United
States, &c. The Chair thinks it is not a private
bill.
Mr. FLORENCE. The Committee on Naval
Affairs directed me to report it as a private bill.
It is a law by which certain engineers are to re-
ceive certain allowances.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is sorry to differ
with the Committee on Naval Affairs. [Laugh-
ter.]
Mr. HOUSTON. It is a private bill with pub-
lip
Mr. FLORENCE. If the Chair will do me the
favor to read the second line of this bill he will see
that it is a private bill. It is to allow certain en-
gineers of the Navy for certain services.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is of opinion that
it would be a very general law if it were passed.
Mr. FLORENCE. It would be ifit were passed.
But it is a private bill, notwithstanding. It is for
the relief of certain engineers of the United States
Navy.
The SPEAKER. The Chair thinks it cannot
be received as a private bill.
Mr. FLORENCE. Well, I defer to the opin-
ion of the Chair.
draper and holden.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio, from the Commit-
tee on Naval Affairs, reported a bill for the relief
of Nehemiah S. Draper and William Holden,
heirs-at-law of Mary Draper, deceased; which was

mittee of the Whole House, and, with the report,

admission op minnesota.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. I desire to give
notice that when the Minnesota bill comes up I
shall offer a substitute; and I now ask the unan-
imous consent of the House to have it printed for
the convenience of members.
There being no objection, it was so ordered.
hubbell's explosive shell.
Mr. FLORENCE. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Naval Affairs to ask that the papers and
report in the case of Hubbell's explosive shell
may be printed for the use of the committee. The
papers are very voluminous, and it is almost im-
possible for the committee to consider them unless
they are printed.
Mr. SEWARD. I think the gentleman from
Pennsylvania is laboring under a slight misappre-
hension.
Mr. FLORENCE. Let the gentleman not at-
tempt to correct nje till he has heard what I have
to say. I am such ail exceedingly good natured
sort of person that the floor has "been twice taken
from me to-day. The Committee on Naval Af-
fairs directed me to ask that the House shall order
the printing of these capers, and that they be re-
roferred to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. SEWARD. I think that the gentleman
from Pennsylvania is laboring under a very slight
misapprehension about this matter. My under-
standing was that it was agreed that the question
as to the printing of these documents should be
postponed till the next meeting. It is a volumin-
ous document, and 1 see no necessity, in the pres-
ent aspect of the case, for having it printed.
The SPEAKER. The Chair desires to inquire
of the gentleman from Pennsylvania what his spe-
cific motion is r
Mr. FLORENCE. The Committee on Naval
Affairs directed me to report these papers to the
House, and asked to have them printed and re-
referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. SEWARD. I ask the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Sherman] if that was his understand-
ing of it? I certainly did not so understand it.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. These papers were
presented, and referred to the Committee on Na-
val Affairs. They were taken up by the com-
mittee, but were found to be so voluminous that
it was difficult to examine them, and it was sug-
gested that the gentleman from Pennsylvania
should rise in his place and ask permission to
have them printed. I did not suppose that any
report was to be made. I hope the request to
print will be granted.
Mr. FLORENCE. Does the gentleman from
Georgia want to raise a question of veracity be-
tween the gentleman from Ohio and myself? be-
cause, if he does, I will summon before this high
tribunal the clerk of the Committee on Naval Af-
fairs, and perhaps I can bring up the record, too.
Mr. HOUSTON. I want to understand the
point. My understanding of the statement of the
gentleman upon my left is, that the Committee
on Naval Affairs desires that those papers shall
be printed because they are so voluminous that
the committee cannot examine the merits of the
papers in their present shape. Is that so?
Mr. FLORENCE. It is.
Mr. HOUSTON. Then I have no objection.
Mr. SEWARD. I understand that the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania had the right conceded
to him by the committee to make application here
upon his own responsibility.
Mr. FLORENCE. I cannot hear the gentle-
man from Georgia.
Mr. SEWARD. I did not intend to raise a
question of veracity between the gentlemen.
The papers were then ordered to be printed,
and to be referred back to the Committee on Naval
Affairs.
