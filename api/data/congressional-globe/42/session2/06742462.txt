THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 16,
derful plain or great valley between the Rocky
mountains and the Sierra Nevada, in which
there seems to be no sort of doubt that for
nearly twelve hundred miles from our north-
ern line down to the frontier of Mexico there
are deposits of base metals, which, so soon as
they can come within the grasp of easy and
cheap reduction, will constitute sources of
wealth compared to which everything that has
yet been heard of, either in North America
or elsewhere in the world, will be as a mere
rivulet of wealth. I do not wish, however, to
prolong debate on the subject.
Mr. POMEROY. I think the Senator had
better withdraw his amendment and let us
consider it by itself on the bill which appro-
priates the proceeds of the public lands. The
mineral lands will properly be considered
under that bill, for which there has been a
special day set apart on account of the Sen-
ator from Vermont, on which we are to con-
sider the question of what we will do with the
proceeds of the sales of the public lands. I
think the mineral lauds should be considered
in that connection rather than this. If the
Senator will withdraw his amendment and
offer it then, we can dispose of this bill with-
out further debate.
Mr. CASSERLY. I was about to say, when
I saw the Senator from Kansas rise to make a
suggestion, that I do not desire to have this
bill encounter the opposition of the Senator
from Ohio, and I do not wish, either, to place
myself in opposition to the views of an author-
ity justly so high in the Senate as he is on
the subject of the financial administration of
the Government. Therefore I withdraw the
amendment.
The amendment of the Committee on Mines
and Mining, as amended, was agreed to.
Mr. CASSKELY. I should like to ask
some Senator of the committee from which
this bill has been reported what is the mean-
ing of the three lines upon page 4, lines sev-
enteen, eighteen, and nineteen?
On all claims located prior to the passage of this
act, ton ilotlars' worth of labor shall bo performed
or improvements made for each one hundred foot in
Jonsth aloiif? Iho voin.
I observe that there is no limitation as to
the time within which that amount of labor
shall have been done.
Mr. STEWART. It might make it more
certain to s.iy "during each year."
Mr. CASSKliLY. The usual mining rule
is so mueh labor during so much time.
Mr. STEWART. Insert "each year."
Mr. CASSEHLY. " Ten dollars' worth of
labor shall be performed or improvements
â– made each year for each one hundred feet
in length along the vein." I move so to
amend it.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. CASSEIlbY. I should like to inquire
what was done with the amount of fifteen hun
dred feet on page 2, lines eight and nine.
Mr. STEWART. Nothing has been done.
Mr. OASSEUJjY. Does the Senator con-
sider that there is no danger of abuse in allow-
ing sogteat a quantity?
Mr. STEWART. None in the world.
The bill was reported to the Senate as
amended, and the amendment made as in
Committee of the Whole was concurred in. It
was ordered that the amendment be engrossed
and the bill read a third time. The bill was
read the third time, and passed.
MESSAtiB FROM 'l'UB HOUSE.
A message from the House of Representa-
tives, by Mr. McPhebsox, its Clerk, announced
that the House had non-coucurred in the
amendments ot the Senate to the bill (H. R.
No. 1980) relating to proposals and contracts
for transportation of the mails, and for other
purposes, asked a conference on the disagree-
ing votes of the two Houses thereon, and had
appointed Mr. John F. Paknswouth of Illi-
nois, Mr. Ginery TwicaELX.of Massachusetts,
and Mr. John M. Carroll of New York,
managers at the same on its part.
The message also announced that the House
had passed the following bill aud joint resolu-
tion ; in which it requested the concurrence of
the Senate:
A bill (H. R. No. 2208) making appropri-
ations for the repair, preservation, and com-
pletion of certain public works on rivers and
harbors, and for other purposes ; and
A joint resolution (H. Ii. No. 136) appoint-
ing commissioners to inquire into depredations

MAIL CONTRACTS.
The Senate proceeded to consider its amend-
ments to the bill (H. R. No. 1930) relating to
proposals and contracts for transportation of
the mails, and for other purposes, disagreed
to by the House of Representatives; and
On motion by Mr. RAMSEY,
Resolved, That the Senate insist upon its amend-
ments to the said bill disagreed to by the House of
Representatives, and agree to the conference asked
by the House on the disagreeing votes of the two
Houses thereon.

AUSTRALIAN MAIL LINK.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Australian
steamship bill is now before the Senate.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (S. No. 49)
authorizing the establishment of ocean mail
steamship service between the United States
and Australia.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
reported.
Mr. POMEROY. I suppose it is only neces-
sary to read the amendment reported by the
Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads.
That amendment strikes out all of the original
bill and inserts a substitute.
Mr. COLE. It lias all been read once.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The substitute
will be reported, and it will be consideied as
the original bill, so that it will be subject to
amendment in the second degree if Senators
desire to so amend it.
The Chief Clerk read the amendment of the
Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads,
which was to insert in lieu of the original bill
the following:
That tho Postmaster General, by and with the
consent of the President, is hereby authorised and
directed to contract for mail steamship service

in tlie Sandwich Islands, or such other pons in tho
Pacific ocean as may become necossary for coaling
purposes, by means of a line, to run once in every

Mr. POMEROY". Without occupying the
time in making any remarks myself, 1 will
a?k to have the report submitted by the Com-
mittee on Post Offices and Post Roads, when
they reported this bill, read. It shows the
history of this project. It shows its recom-
mendations by the President of the United
States, by the Postmaster General, and by the
Secretary of the Treasury. It gives the stand-
ing which this matter has had in the Senate,
i ask for the reading of the report.
The Chief Clerk read the following report
submitted by Mr. Cole, from the Committee
on Post Offices and Post Roads, on the 18th
of January last:
Your committee, to whom Senate bill No. 49 was
referred, have fully considered its provisions, which
authorize the establishment of ocean steamship ser-
vice between the United States, New Zealand, and
Australia, touching at various islands in the Pacific
ocean: the service to consist of thirteen round voy-
ages per annum.
Your committee are unanimous in recommending
the pa<s;\ge of the bill; a conclusion arrived at anil
based upon a mass of data going to prove the great '
importance of opening up without delay a vast com-
merce, which rightly belong-? to and can be secured
to American enterprise. Upward of two million
people, puwipally English and Scotch, constitute
the population of those colonics, who curried with
them to their now homes the language, literature,
and customs of the Anglo-Saxon raccs, and have laid
tho foundation of a new empire which hits, tliu^ far,
greaily ou test lipped our Pacific States, while the Eng-
lish Government, by its liberal policy toward com-
mercial enterprises, is drawing tue commerce of the
Pacilic into those colonial ports.
Taking the colony of Victoria, with a population
of seven hundred and twenty-nine thousand, as
fairly representing the commerce ol those colonies,
Melbourne being its chief port, with a population of
one hundred and ninety thousaud. this colony alone,
Irom the report of the registrar general for 1871,
shows imports amount,ing to upward of Â£70,000,000,
and exports to $64,447,000.
In proof of the immense profit thelincsof English
eubsidized steamships are to this one colony, your
committee beg leuvc to quote from a speech nmdo
to the colonial parliament of Victoria, in November
last, by the honorable the colonial secretary, urging
the Government to vote a liberal subsidy towmd se-
curing to the colonies the commcrce of the Pacific*.
Mr. Duffy said "he would not admit the statement
of the honorable member tor West Melbourne, that
this colony had only a secondary interest in the San
Francisco route, for he believed that the business
men of this colony, with their usual energy, would
take advantage of the route, and make it as bene-
ficial to this colony as any other route could possibly
be to it. The honorable member next argued that a
fortnightly mail service by one route would only
serve communication along that route, wheieastwo
services by different routes would facilitate trade
and commerce with various parts of the world. The
statement of the honorable member for West Mel-
bourne, that of tho Â£26,000,000 sterling ot trade of
this colony, Â±,20,000,000 of it was carried on along the
route of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, or at
the termini of that line, and that the trade which
would be served by the San Pancisoo route was only
very small, was. he contended, the strongest argu-
ment which could be given in fa.vor of the latter route.
The great trade which was done along the Suez
route showed that a thoroughly postal route carried
on for a series of yeais had been the reason why
trade'aud commerce had gone in that direction, and
