HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,

July 30, 1864. (Received 10 a. m.)

General HANCOCK:

The mine worked splendidly, blowing their battery to pieces, burying the guns and killing and wounding quite a number. We hold about 400 yards of that line, and are gaining ground.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

The lieutenant-general commanding directs a raid on the Weldon railroad to be made by the cavalry to-morrow, supported by a corps of infantry. One of your corps must be sent; I leave it to to say which will be the most convenient. If General Hancock can be relieves early to-night the Eighteenth Corps could resume its former position. I do not know the exact position of the Eighteenth now; how much has come out from Burnside's front, or how much remains. The corps should have five days' rations. Please give me your views as soon as practicable.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
