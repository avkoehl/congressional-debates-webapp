see and have learned, the artillery upon the whole line was most skillfully and judiciously managed by the respective officers in charge of it. This was particularly so in regard to Captain Jones, Eleventh Massachusetts, from Fort Friend; Captain and Brevet Major Woerner, Third New Jersey Battery, from fort Haskell; and First Lieutenant and Brevet Captain Stone, Fifth U. S. Artillery, from Battery No. 9. Captain and Brevet Major Roemer, Thirty-fourth New York Battery, in Fort McGilvery and Lieutenant Bangs, First Connecticut Artillery, in Battery No. 5, disregarding a concentrated fire from other parts of the enemy's lines, turned their guns upon the enemy in and about Fort Stedman.

Appended is a report from Major Miller, First Pennsylvania Artillery, of what he saw and heard while a prisoner in Fort Stedman. His zeal and energy led to his capture. The tact which he displayed in preventing himself from being sent within the enemy's lines, and the influence and management which he gained and exercised over his captors, resulting in his leading into our lines several hundred of them, gives him just claims for admiration and praise.

All of the battery commanders speak in the highest praise of the bravery and willingness of their officers and men.

Accompanying this is a list of the killed, wounded, and missing of this brigade.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. C. TIDBALL,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
