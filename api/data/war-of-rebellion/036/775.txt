May 12, we advanced about 7 miles toward Raymond, near which place we found Major-General Logan's DIVISION severely engaged with the enemy. The brigade, by direction of Brigadier-General Crocker, was at once formed in support of several batteries found in position on the left of the road, but not engaged.

Remaining here a short time, the Eightieth Ohio and Tenth Missouri were ordered to the support of Brigadier-General Stevenson, preparatory to an advance into town, the former to his center and the latter to the extreme right wing. Having taken the position assigned, the whole line of battle moved forward 1 1/2 miles, and entered the place, the enemy evacuating without further opposition, except from his artillery, which did no damage to those of my command. One lieutenant and a few prisoners were captured by Company A, Tenth Missouri.

The brigade and DIVISION encamped near the town, and marched again on the morning of the 13th to Clinton, without opposition, and encamped 1 mile east of that place, on the Vicksburg and Jackson Railroad.

The march was resumed on the morning of the 14th toward Jackson, the SECOND Brigade leading. In view of the probability of soon meeting the enemy, a heavy force of skirmishers from the Tenth Missouri was thrown forward and deployed with supports. Advancing about 3 miles, the enemy was discovered in force on both sides of the road, occupying a commanding position, his right covered by a dense thicket of oak bushes, his center and artillery at Wright's house, with his left on the continuation of the ridge. The main position at the house was also covered by a line of infantry formed in the ravine in his immediate front. His artillery commanded the road and an open country of undulating ridges for 1 1/2 miles in the direction of our approach. Upon discovering the enemy, the SECOND Brigade was at once deployed, the Tenth Missouri, Lieutenant-Colonel Horney, to the right of the road, and the Eightieth Ohio, Colonel Bartilson, and the SEVENTEENTH Iowa, Colonel Hillis, to the left. The First Missouri Battery was now taken into position and my line changed so as to support it, with the SEVENTEENTH Iowa on the left of the road, the Eightieth Ohio in the center on the right of the road, and the Tenth Missouri on the right of the line, the whole supported on the right by the First Brigade, Colonel Sanborn, and on the left by the THIRD Brigade, Colonel Boomer. The whole line advanced in a heavy rain and under a severe fire of artillery and skirmishers to within 500 yards of the enemy's main line, when I halted under the shelter of an intervening ridge, preparatory to the final charge. Being again ordered to advance, I commanded my three regiments to fix bayonets, and, at the word, to move at double quick upon the enemy, which they did in excellent order, sweeping everything before them and carrying the position. The Sixth Wisconsin battery, Captain Dillon, was quickly brought to the front, and opened a heavy fire upon the fleeing enemy, who continued his retreat into and through the town of Jackson, abandoning his artillery as he went.

My loss in this battle-mostly in the charge-amounted in all to 215 killed, wounded, and MISSING, out of a force of about 1,000 actually engaged. Lists of the casualties accompany this report. *

The conduct of my officers and men in this action was worthy of all praise, without excepting any.

The brigade bivouacked in the town that night, and in the morning
