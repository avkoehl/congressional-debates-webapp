estimate of the whole expense of the work, a point which he

SPECIAL ORDERS
The first special order being the joint resolution introduced
by Mr. Tahpah, so to amend the Constitution of the tinted
States as to limit the tenure of office of the judges of all the
courts of the U mted States, was taken up

and equalize the mileage of members of Congress
Mr. WALKER called for the yeas and nays, which were or-
dered, and the motion of Mr. Clay was negatived—yeas 21,

Mr. CLAY of Kentucky, said this day had been expressly as
signed for the consideration of the mileage bill, and, under the
circumstances, be deemed it improper that any othe should
take precedence of it. It had been brought to this House three
or four weeks ago, and had not been reported on by the commit-
tee till within three or four days, and there had never been a
formal call oftheiommiuee to act upon it He moved, there-
fore, to postpone the joint resolution on the Constitution, and
make it the order of the day for Monday next
Mr. NORVELL said, that he should not teel himself called
upon to notice any thing which had fallen from the honorable
Senator, [Mr. Cuortof Kentucky,] but for the imputation, lm
plied at least, cast by that Senator upon him as chairman of the
committee on the mileage bill When the bi'l was referred to
the committee, three or four weeks ago, he had before him one
or two subjects ef equal importance with the mileage bill The
charter of the city ol Washington—a subject re/erred to another
committee, of which he was chairman, one week before the re
ference of the other measure—had occupied his attention for
nearly three weeks and when the committee had despatched
that matter, so far as to report it back to the Senate, he was rea
dy to act upon the mileage hill The Senator from Kentucky wai
then absent ínVirginia Upon his return,the Senator called on him
to ascertain when he would convene the committee, and added
that he could not or should not attend the meeting, but that he
Wished to be considered as in favor of the bill The Senator
from Massachusetts, [Mr. I'avis,] another member of the coin
mittee, was immediately informed of what had been said by
the Senator from Kentucky He, too, had expressed his de
sire to be set down as in favor of the hill It then only remained
for him to consult the remaining members of the committee
That he had done, and the result was the report which had been
made against the bill, with a recommendation that it should be
indefinitely postponed. He had deemed it proper to say thus
much in 'explanation, andtto repel the unwarrantable imputa-
tion attempted to be cast upon him by the Senator from Kei.->
tucky.
The motion was then debated at considerable length, in which
the merits of the two antagomstical questions were to some ex-
tent discussed by Messrs. CLAY ol Alabama, WALKER,
TAPPAN, CaLHOUN, and ALI EN.
Mr LUMPKIN said. Mr President, having just voted against
laying the resolutions of the Senator from Ohio on the table,
and intending now to rote in favor of the postponement of their
consideration till Monday next, I consider a word of explanation
due to myself and the Senate. My vote against laying on the
table was given under the impression, that such a dt spositmn
of the subject might be construed into a disapprobati jn of the
proposed amendment of ithe Constitution, when, sir ] fael no
such disapprobation I have long believed that no man
living is entitled to a life estate in any office whatever, under
the true spirit of our institutions. But, sir, the importance of
the subject well entitles lttothe grave and deliberate conside
ration of the Senate We 3hould never act precipitately when
considering a subject invoicing an important alteration in our
fundamental law, the Constitution of our country, bequeathed
to us by the fathers of our glorious Revolution I consider
the proposition to pos pone for a few days only, as varying the
question It gives time for further deliberation, without the
slightest indication of opposition to the proposed amendment
Moreover, sir, I am as anxious as the Senator fiom Kentucky
[Mr. Clay] to have the dual and speedy action of the Senate
upon the subject of fixtngi|Pmileage of the members of Con-
gress. The House of Representatives have sent us a bill upon
 he subject, andi' is our duty to pass upon the menus of that
bill. I am fully prepared to say, the existing law or the prac-
tice which obtains under Its provisions, demands s| eedy and de-
cisive correct.on. The law upon this subject should have a uni-
form and well defined construction. Every member of Con-
gress should be placed upra (besuns footing, and the custom
should no longer be countenanced of members from the same
neighborhood receiving mileage compensation, gieatly vaiymg
in amount, which I understand is the case at present Under
these considerations, I shall vote for the postponement of the íe
solutions until Monday next, when I hope they ma) be taken up
and further discussed
Mr Clay's motion was carried in the affirmative—yt as 21,
nays 19 aslollows
YEAS—Messrs Calhoun Clay of Kentucky Chyton, Cut

The other special orders were now postponed by consent,
and the mileage bill was taken up lor consi leratnn
Mr NORVELL moved its indefinite postponement
Mr CLAY of Kentucky said he hada few remarks to make
on that motion, and would proceed now, or wait till to monow
mornm? at the discretion of the Senate
Mr FULTON moved in adjournment, which was earned in
the affirmative, as follow*

So the Senate adjourned
Messrs. Blair ¿nd Rives- I was necessarily ab
sent when ihe vote was taken to lay the Bankrupt
bill, from the S*nate, on the table. Had 1 reen in
my seat, I should have voted in the affirmative.
JOHN WHITE.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Thtjksdai, JdlyO, 1840
The unfinished business of the morning hour was the joint íe
solution of the Senate authorizing the disposal ol tne | resents
from the Imaum of Muscat, the question pending being on
agreemglto the sarn  as amended by the Committee on Foreign
Affairs                 /
Mr A )AMS bang entitled to the floor, resumed and conclnd
ed his r marks m opposition to the resolution, and in censuring
the cone uct of cmr Consul for receiving ti e presents    He also
arsued i t somejlength, showing the unconstitutionality of re
ceivius inch riesents, and af er he had conclu le I,
Mr PlCKDfíS said he would detain the louse but a very
few minmtesB his reply to the gentlemin from Massachusett
In the JirstAlace he would observe with very great deference
to the sufterjpr judgment of the gentleman that more time ha I
already bte* consumed than the men's of the case required It
also strucVjfhim that th  venerable and very learned gentleman
from Massithusettshad attached more importance to tins par
ticular case than it deserved.
In answer to the question of the gentleman as to whether I
would sanction this as a general law, I most unhes.utftigl}
and distinctly answer in the negative So far from sane ion ng
a general law for the reception of presents from all fiieign
powers, I would be the very last man on this floor who would
agree to it On the contrary, I would most stienuoiHy incul
cate the policy recommended by the circiilir, duee'e 1 to our
foreign agents by General Jackson, prohibiting 'he íeception of
such presents
But the circumstances of the present case are peculiar The
question is not whether the President, or any other off er, shall
be authorized to accept the presents fot his own pt vile use,
because they have been expressly refused by the officers of
Government The ques ion is, whether, under the c rcum
stances of the case Congress shall control the prest nt-, aid lis
po-eofthem in the mo't convenient and suitable m^nne-
The President does not come here an 1 ask es to n thori7e
him to receive the presents for his own private b< i ef they
are tendered to the Government and peo le of the Un ted states,
as a mark of fr endship and regard from Barhai lan pc ■ ers
The gentleman asks what authority Congress lia> to T-t in
thismatter? I refer him to that section of tne Constitution he
himself has quoted, where officers are forhidlento accept pre
sents unless by the consent of Congress
But, in thiscase, we do not even assume the right of atitho
nz ng the officers to receive them Our agents have re
fused them, and they arp tendered to us now as the Re
presentatives of the American people, and becomes us t)
act in accordance with the single jirovis on of the Constitution,
and dispose of thts matter in a way most sm able to the public
interest, and cons stent with the national delicacy under all the
circumstances of the case A portion of tlitse presents hive
been forced upon our Consul at Tangier, and are, in all proba
bility, on their way to this country, nndthe otl er portion have
been sent here by the Imaum of Muscat, i ot kniwing >ur con
s ltut onal prohibition on the subject and are with lisa 'ent in
New York, tendered to the Government                        D
I have said that, in my opinion, the gentleman from Massa
chusetts has a'tiched too much importance to this case I think
also that he has visi ol th a pior Consul at langier with as
unrelenting vengeance as c itam persons of old did when they
thiew Daniel into the lion's den, the gentleman too, in this case
would have himg ven up to the mercy of the Inns As the
Consul escaped, in the f.rst instance, being torn to pieces by
these beasts, the gentleman now thinks it his duty to perform
the operation
But, said Mr P I must be allowed to say that in my judg-
ment,* the gentleman has in several parts placed a forced
construction upon that correspondence
Ijoin with him most fully, that our Consul ought not to sub
mit, in the sligntest degree, to the dictates of a tyrant, or to be
intimidated into a deviation from his duty by the threats of any
foreign power
It is the motive that constitutes a j ust cause of offence We
should examine into the circumstances of the case, and see
what intention governed the officer of the Emperor Was it
his intention to show our agent a mark of respect and regard,
or was it his intention to treat us with contempt, and to insult
our power?
Now the least reflection and examination of the corresnon
dence will show that it was quite the reverse of disrespect and
thnt so lar from our Government bting Heated with contéinriL

tnder these fire t is anees Isuhinit whetbei heConsulwas
justly liable to the indiana ion of the 0entleiiiai from Massa

He may ha1 o wcrlcd his letter mipioperlv, and perhaps in
correctlv, but, under all the encumsumces ot the case, he (vir
PiChXNs) submitted whethei the nation 1 nonor could, in the
least, o" afiected by the reception of the pie ents
If the officer of the Emperor had acted fiom any other mo
tivesthan kit d less and respect, then 1 would have gone with
the ,entleman n his censure of the Consul If the ( onsul had
tarnished our button that emblem of our i annual honor oy
submitting to dictaticn or intimidation, if he had sufleredour
national dignity to be trampled upon it his person, then I would
0 with the gtntlemai fiom Massachusetts, and declare that
the Consul bould be torn to pieces, rathei than suffer his coun
try to bod shonored
But It   il the gentleman has vastlyexaggerated tus matter
1 appeal t > him as to whether, in oui intercourse w th indepen
dent Indian tribes, we do not subm t to their peculiar customs
Tor insta ice m our intercourse with the independent tribes be
yond the Rocky Mountains, would we not comply with their
peculiar customs?
Now supy ise the gentlemai from Massachusetts should b3
sentasan ¿entfrom tht United Sates to one of those inde
pendent tribes on a mission involving the interests ol his coun
try, would he refuse to submit to then peculiai modes ef pro
ceeding and offcis of fnen l-lnp? Suppose they weie to offer
the pipe of peace to the venerable gentleman as they always
do on such occasions, and whith is the invariable piactice of
these rude nations, would the gentleman submit to take it from
t teir mouths, or would he reject the offer «i h anger, and with
his bosom filed with indignation, spurn it, and denounce it as
an insult to the ho mr and power of the country he represented,
cilculated to degrade usl No he was sure the gen leman
would d > no buch thing That gentleman who hart represent
ed us with so muchhonor m the vauous courts of Europe, up
on momentous question had too much sound sense tj refuse to
comply w ith the me de and customs of the tribe to whom he was
sent n0i the gentleman would comply, ard then we should
see the venerable diplomatist sitting cross legged at the coun-
cil fire, with the pipe of peace in his mouth, however ridicu
lous it might appear in the refined eyes of civilized people, as
to mere attitude
It s a rude i ustom, and we submit to these dungs from the
kind monves that attend them So it was with these beasts
the motives with which they were fbiced upon our Consul
weie all kind and friendly
Mr JO\ES here called for the orders of the day, but Mr
Pickens said he would not detain the House five minutes
longer, and wished the matter disposed of without any further
debate
Mr P then allulel to the cases put by Mr Adams as precc
dents when Gmgiess had refused The first case w is the one
in 1713 wieiMi 1'inckney of South Carolina ap|Iied to the
House in relation to the acceptance of certain presents Ho
h d been oui Mimsicr to Spain and England, and they had ten-
de-etl him pie-en's
Now, said Mi P I aik the gentleman if that is a parallel
easel Is theie any similarity between that case and the pre
sentí   There isa wiJediff lenre between the two cases
Mr Pinckney was then a memberof this Hot, e, and when
the presents viere offered to him, he very properly submitted
the matter to the Speaker, andthe House decided that he should
not receive them In that case the presents were designed for
the private use and benefit of Mr Pinckney, and not us in this
case, when the ararles were tendered to the Government and
people of the United States In this instance the presents were
not for the private uie or benefit ol any pubic officer, but were
tendered to us to make such disposition of them as we might
deem proper Th y had been pio[ erly refused by our officers^
and were now the offerings of friendship from barbarian
poweis In th<* case of Mr Pinckney they were offered from
civilized nations who knew better, and for the private use of
Mi Pincl ney In that case the House decided, and decided
property, that he should not receive them, and I hope would so
de iJe agai i, when the case occurre 1 As to the other case,
wlirni a tr°ct of land was presented to General Jackson and
Cu'mel Hawkins b, the Creek Inl.ans in 1814, that had no
sim ai t) wi h thi= affur Tie laud was presented to Jackson
and Hawk ns as individuals, and out of lespect and admiration
to them as men, and not out or regard or respect to our Go
vernment I was purely a private donaron, and noih'ng public
in it, except that it was offered from a nation of Indians There
was a cise, however, in the session of 183J-.J5, wien we re-
ceived a id ordered two hoi ses and a lion to ne sold by the Pre
sideni, v ithout objection, and the proceeds of the horses were
p iced in the lieasury, and of the lion divided amongst the
Orphan Asylums of this Di tnct I y General Jackson
Mr P ther asked to be allowed to refer to a transac
tion, honorable to the Imaum of Muscat, and which would
do hcor to any Christian prince in Europe It was
well known that he was o"e of the most powerful princes
of Africa,  his dominions started the shores, of the Per.
