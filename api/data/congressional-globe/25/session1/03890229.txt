victims upon those w ho forbade the banns I will
also refer to another evidence ot that discrepancy
between profession anil piactice, which has so sig
nally characterized the partisan power for the last
eight jears In New York, Virginia, Alabama,
and perhaps other States, known to be governed by
the self styled demociatic party, laws ha\ ebeen pass-
ed authorizing the suspension of specie payments by
the banks, and releasing them from forfeiture of
charter and other penalties This i« done by those
who tell the people they are m favor of an exclusive
hard money currency, and against all banks In
Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Maryland, whose Execu-
tives are known to be opposed to Mr Van Buren,
it was determined to put the banks on then good be-
havior, and thus prompt them to a wholesome and
prudent course, believing that the people themselves
would extend any indulgence which the occasion
called for, if the conduct of the banks was honest
and prudent And the proclamation of the Governor
ot Pennsylvania, assigning reasons for refusing to
convene the General Assembly at the moment of
alaim, will constitute an abiding evidence oí his
wisdom and forecast Now, Mr Chairman, which
of these classes of States, judging by their lespec-
tive measures just alluded to, is most in favor oí the
banking system t
I do not desire to discuss, at this time, the merits
of the several bills reported for our consideration
It will be time enough to do so as they shall be
called up
But, I must declare my opinion that they do no!
singly, or together, constitute a sufficient reason for
the special convocation of Congress Surely it was
not necessary to bring us hei e to extend the time on
merchants' bonds As the President did extend
this time three months, he could have done so for
six4 and that period would have found us here at
the usual session
I am equally incredulous as to the urgent neces-
sity of the Treasury ior money, especially as the
Secietary informed us that he had and could, with
out public injury, suspend some fifteen millions of
appropriations With the admitted means on hand
and oui current revenue, the operations of Govern-
ment mighf surely hav e been continued until De-
cember
As for the proposed bill adjusting the accounts
with the deposite banks, that was not important
enough to authorize the proclamation, for, the
Secretary admits that he ha*, already used a consid-
erable part of all their balances, and, if they would
not pay, the laws and courts were open to him,
quite as wide as it is m the power of Congress to
place them
What measure remains1 The famous act for
the safe-keeping of the public monev We shall
have no occasion for this law before December, ll
what the Secretary of the Treasuiy savs is true,
that the Treasury is empty '
I must, however, notice a single bill on the busi-
ness of this District, foi which Congress is a local
legislature It is proposed to forfeit the charters
of the several banks in this District, if they do not
resume specie pajmerits in some very brief period
fiom this time
The people of the District do not complain to us
of any grievance, but the Committee of Ways and
Means, by their chairman, report a harsh and
highly penal law I do not mean to defend these
banks, sir I know nothing of them But I cannot
resist the comparative view of the legislation on the
same subject m the State of New York from which
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means (Mr Cambreleng) comes, and that which
he now purposes for this District We are to com-
mence heie, I suppose, to try the hard money expe-
riment This poor Disti ict is to be made the scape-
goat to expiate the sins of the States, or, which is
more probable, is to constitute the hapless subject foi
the experimenting doctors m this new «vstem of
Treasury finance to operate on After the manner of
the cunous and cruel experimenters m prussic acid
and other poisonous drugs, with a view to test what,
if any, remedy will at rest their destructive powers,
the poison is fir=t administered to a dog ot rabbit,
for the future benefit of man Just so here The
District of Columbia is to be made the t-jrpeiimrnt
mg subjectof the hard moneytheorj All its banks
may be utterly ruined, and its people put to serious
incon veniente but, m the mean time, the pariv will
have the benefit oí all its political influence, and it
will not cost any thing to the banks nor the people
of the State of New Yoi k Sir, we have gone far
enough with these Treasury nostrums, it is now pro
posed to give No 6 I am unwilling to see or con
sent to hat e it administered
Finally, Mr Chairman, I do sincerely believe
that the President has not made to usthe suggestions
which he designed to submit, when he fust issued
hisproelamation, and that they are withheld because
he found he could not make them without at least
partially admitting the past errois of his partv,
which he had not the firmness and magnanimity to
do
The bill on which we are now to vote does not
deserve the primary consideration of Congress at
such a crisis I am unwilling to postpone the pay-
ment of any part of the money promised to the
States even for a day, and, if it is now w ithheld, I
trust the States will keep up "a continual claim"
until this Government redeems its violated faith
measures necessary to regulate, in the present
emergency, the safe keeping and transfer of the
public moneys In the performance of constitu-
tional duty, I have stated to them, without inerve,
the result of my own reflections. The subject is
of great importance, and one on which wfe cart
scarcely expect to be as united in sentiment as we
are in interest. It deserves a full and free discus-
sion, and can not fail to be benefitted by a dis-
passionate comparison of opinions. Well aware
mj self of the duty of reciprocal concession afnong
the cd-ordinate branches of the Government, I can
promise a reasonable spirit of co-operatton, so far
as it can be indulged in without the surrender of
constitutional objections which I believe to be well
founded. Any system that may be adapted, should
be subjected to the fullest legal provision, so as to
leave nothing to the Executive but what is neces-
sary to the discharge of the duties imposed on him,
and, whatever plan may be ultimately established,
my own part shall be so discharged as to give to it
a fair trial and tile best prospect of success."
1 trust, then, that the friends of the Administra-
tion will view this question as one of expediency,
and not suffer any difference of opinion between
themselves to become a difference of principle
upon which they are to divide. If it be not so
viewed, who will take the responsibility, and who
will vouch for the consequences of a contrary
course ? It is a subject on which men may honest-
ly differ, and it is for that reason, amongst others,
that such difference should be expressed with per-
fect frankness, and with the utmost freedom. My
mind has long been made up against it, and the
reasoning of the Message, whilst it has not convin-
ced me to the contrary, has enly served to confirm
my previous opinions I am, therefore, bound to
sat, from ásense of the most imperative duly,
that, in my judgment, this measure is fraught with
more mischief than any scheme which has hereto-
fore been broached in íeference to the finances of
the Government, and the currency of the country
In saying this, 1 certainly intend none other than
the most profound respect for the distinguished
individual who has, in an official form, brought it
to our notice
Neither is this scheme new to the democracy of
the country  It has once been passed upon by them,
through their representatives in Congress, and re-
ceived their unqualified condemnation.    It was
brought forward in the House, in the session of
1834-5, by a member of the opposition.   After aft
animated debate, it was most signally defeated    It
was put down by every administration vote save
one.    It is, however, due to the opposition to say
that it was received with so little favor by them as
a party, that only thirty-three members could be
found who were willing to record their names for
it on the journal.   The defeat of this measure, at
that time, was a matter which every friend of the
administration, from President Jackson down, had
very much at heart.   We all took a deep interest
in it.   We all looked upon it as salculated to un-
dermifte our free institutions , as subversive of the
very principles of the party to which we belonged,
as accumulating power and patronage m the hands
of the Executive, to which we had alwa>s been
opposed, as uniting in his hards the pmse and the
sword, about which so much had been said on a
then recent occasion, and wh ch w e had repelled m
a manner and with a spirit which became those
who  weie honestly desirous   of   presetvihg   the
powers of the Government as they were originally
intended to be distributed by the Constitution  Nay,
sir, we went further, >ve denounced it as a "pro-
posi'ion disorganizing and revolutionary, subver-
sive of the fundamental principles of our Govern-
ment, and of its entire practice, from 1789 down
to the present day "  We denounced it as a scheme
which  would "bring the public treasure  much
nearer the actual custody and control of the Presi-
dent than it is now, and expose it to be plundered
by a hundred hands, where one can not now reach
it"   The party was never more unanimous on
any occasion than this    Their abhorrence of the
scheme was universal.   So powerful were the ar-
guments against it, both in and out of Congress, b}
the republican representatives -and by the republi-
can press, that it received no favor in any quarrel.
Even the opposition,  notwithstanding the)   wete
SPEECH OF MR. TALLMADGE,
Of New  York,
In Senate, September 22,1837.—On the bill imposing
additional duties, as depositaries in certain cases,
on public officers.
Mr. President The bill on your table proposes
to establish, lor the reception, safe-keeping, and
disbursement of the revenues of the Government,
what is generally termed the Sub-Treascry system
This measure has been brought forward in pursu
anee of the recommendation of the President of
the United States, m his lecent Messape to Con-
giess. I do not flatter mjself that I can add much
to the arguments which have been so abt) and so elo-
quently urged my friend from Virginia (Mr. tlives)
against this measure. But, coming from a State
where its practical operation, for good or for evil,
must be so sensibly felt, I deem it my duty to give
frankly to the Senate the views which I entertain
in relation to n
Sir, I have bestowed upon this subject all that re-
flection which is due to it, from the high source
from which it emanates Every consideration, both
personal and political, would incline me to its sup-
port, if my judgment could be satisfied that its
adoption would promote the great interests of the
country Natives of the same State and of the same
county, the President and myself have been, from
my first entrance into political life, dewn to the
present time, on terms of intimacy. In his politi-
cal career, he has, on all occasions, received my
cordial support. It has been my fortune to be
placed m situations, at certain trying peí tods of his
hirtory, which have enabled me to render him,
" some service " It is with no ordinary sensstion,
therefore, that I find myself constrained, by higher
considerations than those of political attachment
or personal friendship, to differ from him en the
question now before us—considerations of public
duty which involve the public weal. But I have
the satisfaction to know that he neither expects nor
desires me to support this or any other measure
merely because it bears the stamp of an Executive
recommendation. In submitting this Sub-Treasu-
ry system, the President has only obeyed an injunc-
tion of the Constitution, which he is sworn to sup-
pjrt, and which declares that "He shall, from
time to time, give to the Congress information of the
stateof the Union, and recommend totheirconsider-
ation such measures as he shall judge necessary and
expedient " This is one of those measures the Pte-
sident has discharged his duty in recommending
it to our consideration, and I trust we shall discharge
ours, by giving to it that calm investigation and
flee di'cussion which are so well calculated to pro-
duce correct results in regal A to measures that m-
volve the great and vital interests of the peop'e
The President himself anticipated much diver-
sity of sentiment on this subject. He anticipated,
also, that Congress might, in its wisdom, adopt '
some other sj stem, and he gave the assurance of
his co-opeiation in any other plan which might be
"ultimately established."   He says                            |
"With these  views,  I  leave to  Congiess the   ¡
