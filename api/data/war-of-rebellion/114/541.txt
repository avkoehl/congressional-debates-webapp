several pieces of cannon. This last intelligence was given us by the flag of truce sent me yesterday in answer to one from me some days before, proposing an exchange of prisoners. The flag was borne by Buford (N. B.), whom you recollect as my classmate at West Point from Kentucky. He is colonel of the Twenty-seventh Illinois Regiment. He was very cordial and talked freely of the war in general.

They released all they had left having released others before receiving my proposal and I released to him those in my camp. I do not credit the story in regard to Thompson as I have been informed since hearing it that he was advised of the approach of the force that was said to have defeated him. * * *
