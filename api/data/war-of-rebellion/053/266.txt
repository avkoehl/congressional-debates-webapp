General HOOKER:

The damage was throwing down obstructions, earth, stones, &amp;c. The conduct of the commanding officer of the guard was damnable, as near as I can learn. Have ordered his arrest, and of a strong mind to drum-head and shoot him.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

COWAN, October 10, 1863-10.50 a.m.

Colonel INNES:

Reports that tunnel was obstructed caused me to delay an engine to get tools down to clear it out. This urgent necessity only would prompt me to take so dangerous a step. All is clear now. Will have the telegraph repaired here shortly, and the trains can move as ordered. Your dispatchers at Nashville cannot certainly move trains when the telegraph and railroad is obstructed. Under no other circumstances would I interfere at all or allow any one else to.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

COWAN, October 10, 1863-10.50 a.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

The tunnel is now clear and telegraph working. Shall the detachment of Eleventh Corps, just arrived here, be returned, and where to? Have about 1,000 men here from above.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, October 10, 1863-11.30 a.m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD:

Let the detachment be returned. Will determine where to go on their arrival. Hope the cars can run from this out. We are short on supplies.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General SLOCUM,

Murfreesborough:

Arrived here at 10 o'clock this morning with Fifth and Twentieth Connecticut,and One hundred and twenty-third New York Volunteers. The Fifth has gone to tunnel at Cowan, which has been obstructed. Nothing new of rebels since last night. The late movements of troops has been arduous and not eminently fruitful.

A. S. WILLIAMS,

Brigadier-General.
