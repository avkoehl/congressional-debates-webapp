MAJOR: I have the honor to report that last night about 11 p. m. the enemy attacked our picket-line between Fort Hays and Fort Morton. About the same time our batteries opened along the line, our batteries opened along the line, and a heavy cannonading continued until near daylight, with what result as year has not been ascertained. The enemy are erecting a new fort to our right of Fort Morton, about 2,200 yards distant. Twelfth New York Battery report two men slightly wounded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Division:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to forward herewith a map* of the position in my front, showing the old picket-line captured November 5, the new line, the rebel picket-line and fortifications, with their dam and the submerged ground. The high ground now fortified by the enemy has always been held by them, and their assault has gained them no new position of value for offensive purposes. They are still hard at work on their new rifle-pits.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your servant,

T. W. EGAN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
