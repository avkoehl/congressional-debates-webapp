General DWIGHT,

Stephenson's Depot:

The cavalry was to have moved at daylight this morning and ought to reach your post by 10 or 11 a.m.

Of course it is intended you should bring up the artillery from the station.

General DWIGHT:

GENERAL: Major-General Hancock directs that when the cavalry returns from its reconnaissance that you withdraw your division as far as Mill Creek, just south of Winchester, covering the Valley pike, the Back and Front Royal roads.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,April 4, 1865.

Brevet Major-General TORBERT,

Chief of Cavalry:

Major-General Hancock directs me to say to you that information leads him to believe there can be no truth in the reports brought in by your officers. Pickett's division is reported in to-day's papers as having been engaged with Sheridan at Petersburg. The general desires you to make as thorough a reconnaissance as possible and dispose of as much of Rosser's cavalry as you may be able to reach with your supply of rations. When you return you can go into camp with your force concentrated near Kernstown, with one brigade at Berryville. The force at Berryville need not be over 1,000 men. When you arrive at Kernstown the infantry now there will be withdrawn.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,,

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
