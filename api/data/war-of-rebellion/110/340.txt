ON COMITE RIVER, LA., August 10, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I was much gratified to receive your note of the 8th instant* by the hands of my friend Mr. Johnston, and to see that you are full of hope and reslolution. I would make any sacrifice to join you, except leaving the remant of my command. I will remain with it under all circumstances. My hear t goes with you on your northward march. I feel that you will reahc the Ohio River, if you don't do more. We must fight them next autumn in Kentucky, and make them begin at the line of the Ohio with their newly raised forces, or Kentucky and Tennessee will be lost to us. A stong movement will give us large accessions in both these States. My division was over 8,000 strong at Tupelo, now I have not 2,000 for duty. I did the best at Baton Rouge, and with inferior forces whipped them soundly. Under the circumstances it was impossible to accomplish more than we did. I hope you will take Mr. Jouhnsotn with you to Kentucky. He is an excellent gentleman, able, and thoroughly informed in regard to the State.

Pardon this hadty note, and believe me, yours, very truly,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE.

JACKSON, August 11, 1862

President DAVIS:

I got orders this morning from Bragg to take offensive toward north. I have no army after leaving sufficiuent garrison, &c., with exception of Breckinridge with about 5,000 effective men. May I have exchanged prisoners, or some of them! I did hope to go to New Orleans first, but a m always ready to go where most required. Give me the returned prisoners and arms for the and I will march for Louisville with Price and Bragg. Breckinridge will attack Baton rRouge again about Thursday with a little over 6,000 men, six batteries. Hope to establish batteries at Port Hudson. Can your order me more heavy guns!

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
