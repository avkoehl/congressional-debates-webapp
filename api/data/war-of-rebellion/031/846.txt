MARIETTA, OHIO, December 10, 1862-11.25 a.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch of yesterday, by mistake in telegraphing, was not received in intelligible form till 9.30 this morning. General Kelley is at Cumberland with his division. General Milroy is concentrating his division, except a few small garrisons in Randolph and Upshur Counties, at Petersburg and Moorefield, in Hardy County. At these positions I have thought they would mutually support each other in case of advance of the enemy west, while Milroy can also protect the country from Beverly west. They also threaten the Shenandoah from these points, and can unite in an advance when desired. General Kelley will report the numbers they can concentrate to the front after deducting their garrisons at post in rear.
