able I will keep the Fifteenth Corps on the east of Neuse as high up as Neuse Mills, and the Seventeenth to Battle's Bridge. Have the bridges at the heads of columns. Send to Logan at once and turn him on his course, and I take it for granted you have a road from Pine Level to Pineville. You had better stay at Pine Level, or come and see me here in the morning.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Pine Level, N. C., April 11, 1865.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: General Logan reports at Lowell Factory that his detached division under General Woods is at Folk's Bridge. The bridge had been destroyed, but he would soon have it repaired so as to cross this p. m. The General will coross his three divisions at Lowell Factory, to-night. Do your wishes with regard to destroying factories, mills &amp;c., remain the same as during previous campaigns? Your note just received. I had issued my marching orders in accordance with your former letter. I have now sent special instructions to General Logan. General Blair can move more directly than to go through Smithfield. Your note expressed a wish to see me. Is it important that I go to Smithfield?

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Smithfield, N. C., April 11, 1865.

Major General O. O. HOWARD,

Commanding Right Wing:

GENERAL: Your note is received. You need not have the Lowell Factory destroyed. I will wait our reception at Raleigh to shape our general policy. You may instruct General Logan to exact bonds that the factory shall not be used for the Confederacy. Of course the bond is not worth a cent, but if the factory owners do not abide by the conditions they cannot expect any mercy the next time. Until we get to Raleigh I propose to keep up connection back with Goldsborough. I shall await your coming to-morrow morning. I send you a Raleigh paper of the 10th.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

I. The Fifteenth Army Corps, Major General John A. Logan commanding, will move to-morrow in the direction of Pineville, arriving at that point if practicable. The Seventeenth Army Corps, Major General F. P. Blair commanding, will move to Watson's Mill. These headquarters
