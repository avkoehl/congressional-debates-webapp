Expenditures of the Government—Mr Murray.
Ho. of Reps.
But whoever may have been the author of this
wise and philanthropic plan for the preservation
of the aborigines, it seems, at any rate, to have
received no " definite action previous to the law
passed eight years ago" upon the pressing sug-
gestions of President Jackson It is clear that,
although sanctioned by piecedmg Administra
tions, the policy was permitted to pass, neverthe
less, without definite action, until Geneial Jackson
took hold of the subject, and made effectual work
of it, as he has usually been remarkable for doing
with everything he has ever undertaken Ihis
one act must give to his administration a lustei
sufficient of itself to shed upon his name " im-
pel ishahle renown "
Mr MERCER lose to a point of order The
gentleman from Kentucky was surely discussing
matters irrelevant to the subject befoie the com
mittee
Mr POPE hoped his friend from Virginia would
not press Ins objection He was not sure but his
colleague was in ordei, but whether he was or not,
he was not taking a wider range in debate than
had been usual foi other gentlemen
The CHAIR (Mr Banks, of Virginia) could
not discriminate between the policy of appropria
tions and the appropriations themselves The
gentleman from Kentucky had a right to discuss
the good or bad policy of the Government expend-
itures
Mr MURRAY proceeded fie had always
known that certain honorable gentlemen were
never easy when this subject of our Indian policy
was alluded to, but he had not supposed the very
able and experienced gentleman from Virginia to
be one of them
I know (said Mr M ) that the Opposition gen-
eral! > have opposed the whole course of this policy,
so wisely suggested, and so successfully executed
Many of them are opposed to every constituent
part of it They are opposed to the purchase of
the lands from the Indians, because it extends and
quickens thegiowth of the new States They aie
opposed to it because they calculate, from the past
legislation of Congress, that thoce of them who
come from the eastern sea board, and from the
districts where great ímnrovements have been
made by the Government, would, but for the pur
chase of these lands, obtain themselves all the
money paid to the Indians therefor, m addition to
the large amounts they now receive 1 hey are
not satisfied with half, they want all the money
the Government can spare Ihey are opposed,
moreover, to the removal of the Indians, because
many of them think the white and the red man
ought to reside in the same nei0hboihood, and
commingle in the same soc ety To such as en
tertam these sentiments, the money appears, no
doubt, to have been worse than wasted
Mr M then adverted to our relations with the
Cherokees He regretted that the gentleman
from Vermont [Mr Everett] had thought pi op
er to bring forward again in review the former
difficulties interposed by Georgia, which, foi a
time, interrupted our relations with that tribe
Ho highly appreciated the worth of that gentle
man's services as a member of the Committee on
Indian Affairs Having been heretofore united
with him as a co member of that committee, he
was able to bear testimony to the value of bis
services, which entitled him to the thanks of the
House, and the gratitude of the Irdians Never
had the Indians a more faithful sentinel in this
House to watch over their interest, and compiain
for their wrongs He would not say there was
nny truth in the good humored suspicion, so often
spoken of in the House, that the honorable mem-
ber must be "akin" to the Indians, but he would
venture to say, that be knew of no living white
man to whom the Indian could so appropriately
address the paternal epithet, "My father " The
Government, says the gentleman, has not kept
her engagements with the Cherokees, because
she had guarantied to them their lands in Georgia,
by the treaty of Holston But did not these
lands belong to the sovereign State of Georgia,
and could the Federal Government give the In-
dians a valid guarantee to the territory of Georgia'
Was she not bound to respect the rights of
Georgia, and to maintain good faith towards that
State>   But then the Government was bound, by
express stipulation in the articles of cession of
1802, to " extuguish the Indian   ule to all lands
within the S ate of Georgia "    This was a main
consideration for which she acqured the rich and
extensive territoiy now compos, ng tne States of
Alabama and   Mississippi     The gentleman de
chned entering on the validity of this " excuse,"
as he called  it     Suppose the Government had
pursued the course to which the gentleman seems
most pamal, what, then, would have  been  the
consequences'    Wh>, sn, her  whole policy  of
remov n¿ and settling the Indiars on lands with
out the  limns of the  States   would   have   been
thwarted, while hei  faith and stipulated obliga
tions to Georgia would have been violated
But the Indians understood well the obligations
of the Government to Geoigia, as well as her ir
reversible purpose to remove all Indians without
the Umita of the States it was this knowledge
that superinduced the pioposition of their pnnci
pal chiefs (John Ross included) to sell to thePres
ident their possessions President Jackson was
willing to buy their lands,but they could notagiee
as to their price At the instance of the chiefs,
the subject was referred to the Senate of the United
States,! omposed then of a majoiity of Opposition
members—a circumstance which no doubt in-
duced the chiefs the more readily to make this
reference Well, the Senate decided that the
Government should pay the Indians $5 000 000,
besides the lauds they were to receive west of the
Mississippi—an awaid with which the chiefs pro-
fessed to be satisfied, and promised to recommend
it to the fav >rable consideiation of their people
How was this pledge kept by them, I will not say
of my own knowledge, lor I have never fully ex
ainined this piint, but I well recollect of hearing
membersafium, on this floor, tnat although John
Ross called the council of his tribe, as he had
promised, yet he had secretly procured the decís
ion given by the Indians on that occasion He
then believed that more could be obtained from
the Government A portion of the tribe, how
evei, accepted the terms by the treaty of New
Echota, which treaty was subsequently confirmed
by the Senate It is true that Ross did notas
sent to this treaty, but it is also true that he and
his co chiefs proposed, of their own accord, to
abide the award of the Senate, that they pro-
fessed to be satisfied with tne award after it was
made, that the amount of money settled by the j
Senate was stipulated to be paid by the Govern |
ment, a large portion of which was, in fact, paid
by the Government before the execution of the
treaty But the gentleman says the Indians weie
forced, by the appearance of seven thousand
armed men among them, under General Scott, at
the time when the treaty was to be executed
But the Indians could not have been taken by sur-
prise, they had ample time to prepare for removal
they had been warned, time after time, that the
treaty would be executed, they had received every
assurance that the Government wou d be just,
and even liberal towards them, but that the treaty
must be executed If they listened to the advic
of professed friends to resist the treaty, they had
no warrant m the conduct of the Government for
so doing But how were they sent ofP Why*
sir, Congress appropriated to them $1,147,000
(in addition to what was before stipulated to be
paid) for their removal, subsistence, &,c , upon
which the Indians, without further murmur, ím
mediately set out for their new homes, not under
a guard of armed men, but undei the guidance of
their own chiefs But the gentleman says that
some three thousand of these Indians died on
their way to the West It is true, they were, on
the road, attacked with the measeis, and perl aps
other diseases, by which great numbers werelost,
though the number given by the gentleman is,
perhaps, somewhat overstated But, sir, (said
Mr M ,) was not this a most remarkable charge
against the Administration> I own I was sur-
prised myself, and listened to hear the Govern-
ment charged next with the loss of seventeen
thousand two hundred Indians, who died of small-
pox on the Missouri river during last spring I
believed, however, that it has been common to
charge the Administration with misfortune resuh
mg from the act of God, oi other circumstances,
over which it had no control     Before reacning
Washington, I was old that the CheroKee chiefs
were receiving an e\;>ibitaiH amount of money
for the ren oval of then people This is all ex-
plained by Mr Crawford In hi3 report he says
"An estimate was submitted by the Cherokee
' clue's on i,he31st July, wmch pu> the cost of íe
' movai of one thousand souls at $65,000, which
' was at length agreed to be given " " It would
'seem," says the report, "that the cost of re-
' moval, according to the Indian estimate, is high,
' but as their own fund pays it, and it was insisted
' on by tneir < wn conf dentia! agents, it was
' thought it could not be i ejected " Theirremoval
was, therefore, at their own expense, the money
being part of the $1,147 067 appropriated by act
of 12 h luly last It will be lecollected that this
appiopnation was made pa-tly to satisfy the dis
content of the Indians, who were complaining of
the terms of the Government, partly to satisfy
some of the Opposition to this Administiation,
who were affirming from the house tops that the
Indians were unfairly used by the Government,
and paitly as a measure of policy, to induce the
removal of the Indiars to their new homes, and
thereby prevent the effusion of blood, which was
likely to ensue from the execution of the treaty
On this head the report continues " Bysome the
' measure may be regarded as just—by others
' geneious " " It perhaps partook of both attri-
1 butes " " If our acts have been generous, they
'have not been less wise and politic. A large
' mass of men have been conciliated, the hazard
' of an effusion of human blood has been put by,
' good feeling has been preserved, and we have
' quietly and gently trarsported eighteen thousard
' f i lends to the west bank of the Mississippi "
Mr M then called the attention ot the House
to the expenditure of $22,000 000 in Indian wars
under the last and present Administratis, viz
For the Black Hawk war, «,2,000 000 for the
Creek and Seminole difficulties, ^20,000,000
This was a large e\pendituie fiom which the
administiation of Mr Adams was exempt He
contended that the Administration was not more
chargeable with this expéndame than.was the ad-
ministration of Mr Madison with the expenses
of the late war with Great Britain He would
not more than allude to the Black Hawk war, as
he was not awareof any charge whrch hadgiown
out of it against the Administration As the war
with the Seminóles, however, had been a leading
subject, on which to found abuse of every char-
acter against the Administration, and that of ex
travagrnce amongst the rest, he would devote a
few moments to its examination By the treaty
of Payre's Landing, May 9, 1832, and ratified
Ap ll 12 1834, the pnnripal thief  of the Sem-
inole Indians sold to the Government of the Uni
ted States alt their possessions in Fonda, upon
condition, however, tl at they should, after exam-
ination, be " sa isfied with the character of the
' countiy to be assigned them for then rew homes
' west of the Missi sippi, and of tie favorable
■ disposition of the Creeks to reunite with them as
' one people " They, at the same lime, appointed
a deputation of their chiefs to pioceed, at the ex-
pense of the United States Government, to exam-
ine the country, and make report After examin
ation ard return, this deputation, in March, 1833,
addressed a letter to the United States commis
sioners appointed for that purpose, informing
them that they were satisfied with tneir new coun-
try Whereupon, by articles bearing date March
28, 1833, and ratified Apnl 12, 1834, the former
treaty is closed and made absolute 411 tnis was
done upon mature reflection, after the lapse of
a year, and after a full examination of their new
land I am aware (said Mr M ) that the resist
anee to this treaty is justified by the gentleman
from Vermont, on the ground that the Creeks re
fused to give them a *' separate allotment of their
soil " Bit this was no part of the tieaty stipu-
lation On the other hand, the stipulation was,
that "an additional extent of territory, propor-
tioned to their numbers, should be added to the
Cieek country " The only thing stipulated to be
obtained from the Creeks was their consent to
" reunite with them as one people " To an appli-
cation for this purpose, the Creeks replied, " they
were wnlmg to receive them within their limits as
a portion of the nation "   This was the extent of
