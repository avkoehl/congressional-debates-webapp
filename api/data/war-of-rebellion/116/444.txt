All persons found in disguise as pretended loyal citizens or under other false pretenses within our lines giving information to or communicating with the enemy will be arrested, tried, condemned and shot as spies.

VII. Persons not commissioned or enlisted in the service of the so-called Confederate States who commit acts of hostility will not be treated as prisoners of war but will be held and punished as criminals, and all persons found guilty of murder, robbery, theft, pillaging and marauding under whatever authority will either be shot or otherwise less severely punished as is prescribed by the Rules and Articles of War, or authorized by the usages and customs of war in like cases. (General Orders, Numbers 13, Department of the Missouri, December 4, 1861.)

S. volunteers or Missouri State Militia, as well as persons captured as rebels, spies, guerrillas, marauders, murderers or in any other way connected with treasonable designs against the constituted authorities of the United States will be kept as prisoners at the posts where the troops are stationed who captured them, and will not be sent beyond this district without authority sent through or from these headquarters.
