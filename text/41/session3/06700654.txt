THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 21,
putable facts, with a flat denial if the truth
happens to beineonvenient? Are not official
statements of intimidation, of fraud, of crime,
and of lawlessness disputed and affidavits dis-
credited? Are not crimes, which have become
of such public notoriety that they cannot be
concealed, charged against the very persons
who are the only sufferers? The fact that such
denials are not resented as a personal offense
is an admission that the disposition to mag-
nify is either a national weakness or that it is
deemed justifiable for political purposes.
I shall ever recollect when for the first time
this exaggeration question was forced upon my
notice.
Some twenty years ago I visited the White
House. I spoke of what I had seen of frontier
life, repeated tales such as I had heard in the
log-houses of the backwoodsmen and around
the camp-fires. Good-humoredly, the Presi-
dent replied: "I know the Federal troops fur-
nish a good market for the country produce—
perhaps the only one those poor frontier people
have." Suppressing my astonishment that
any one could dare to doubt my word, or sup-
pose his own countrymen mean enough to in-
vent these Indian "horrors" merely for the
purpose of procuring a market, I was struck by
the importance of the lesson conveyed by the
words of so high an authority: the lesson to
"be always sure of my evidence."
THE EVIDENCE.
Thus cautioned, I have been careful to
select and lay before you only such facts as
can be proved, and which would, by any court
or jury, be acknowledged as good and unim-
peachable evidence.
When you assigned me, sir, to the Commit-
tee on Indian Affairs, I wrote home at once
asking that a committee be revived which, in
the year 1808, was charged by the people of
San Antonio, in Texas, to collect facts rela-
tive t,o the depredations committed by the
Kickapoo and Lipan Indians. The committee
refused to act. The people are tired of com-
plaining without effect. It is disheartening to
devote time and labor and money to investiga-
tions which you know will be pigeon-holed, or,
if they ever see the light, will be treated as
exaggerations. An energetic merchant, how-
ever, came to the rescue. He had circulars
printed and distributed them over the country,
especially in those couuties which he knew
from his own experience as a frontiersman to
have preeminently suffered. Partially his call
was responded to.
I hold here in my hand the result of one
month's labor; of one month only. A short
time, in'deed, for a territory of over one hun-
dred thousand square miles, without railroads
or telegraphs, where communication is kept
up on horseback, and where the mails travel
at the killing rate of three miles an hour.
Nineteen petitions were sent to me from eleven
different counties. Then the matter was
dropped, becauseits urgeneyindncedour State
Legislature to take it into their own hands.
The people then addressed their petitions to
the latter, because they were confident that
men who from their own experience knew the
sufferings of the frontier would be readier to
act than Representatives whose knowledge of
the Indian it was supposed resulted from the
romantic tales of Fenimore Cooper, or the
occasional displays in the White House, where
the red Brother shakes the white Father by
the hand, complains of his wrongs, how he was
driven from his hunting-ground, and from the
graves of his fathers; how he was chased from
land to land, and reduced to starvation. A
doleful tale, indeed; calculated to make a deep
and lasting impression, were it not relieved by
the gipsy nature of the Indian suddenly crop-
ping out, (beggar and thief!) when he winds
up by asking for blankets and food, for horses
and guns and traps to hunt the buffalo and the
beaver. Buffalo, indeed! Yes, sir; walking
on two legs, and with a scalp like yours and
mine; heaver of the same species, ransomed
at the rate of two and three hundred dollars,
and, as Friend Laurie says in his report, as
high as $1,500 a head, by our peace commis-
sioners.
Speak to our frontiersman of the wrongs the
poor Indian suffered at the hands of the ever-
encroaching Caucasian! He cannot realize a
charity that does not begin at home. And
after all, is it not a law of nature that the
barbarian must give way to civilization? Is it
not the logical consequence of the ever-contin-
uing increase of the numbers of mankind, that
the individual must, in inverse ratio, content
himself with a smaller-space of mother earth,
our common property; that the herdsman will
supersede the hunter, the agriculturist the
herdsman? Civilization is the manifest des-
tiny of mankind. He who resists gets crushed.
That is the history of the wild Indian. But,
sir, it is said this process of civilization was
pursued with great injustice and inhumanity.
It is said that we forced treaties upon the
Indian which he was too ignorant to under-
stand or too feeble to refuse, and that we then
broke the treaties when our interest prompted
us to do it. It is alleged that even when we
did our duty and appropriated the stipulated
sums, our agents did—ah! no, sir, no; not so
small a thing as steal, but that they committed
irregularities on a grand scale, which the In-
dians, in their unsophisticated manner, called
cheating them out of their just dues. All this
may be true, but what influence can such con-
siderations have on our present action?
We have to deal with facts such as they are
not as they might have been had our own
ancestors and we ourselves acted with more
justice, with more humanity. The facts given
by the people of eleven counties, in the afore-
said nineteen petitions, sum up thus : 81 per-
sons killed, 16 persons wounded, and 5 children
kidnapped. The amount of property stolen is
2,920 horses, 558 mules, 950 sheep, and 25,327
beeves. This stolen property is valued at
$854,137.
-I annex a tabular statement, from which it
will be seen, whatever the merits of the valua-
tion be which the petitioners themselves made
of their property, that the average estimate is
very low, namely, seventy-dollars for a mule,
thirty-five dollars for a horse, eight dollars for
a beef, and two dollars for a sheep:

But, sir, what is the value of the one hun-
dred human casualties? Why, sir, in olden
times, when property in man was still a con-
stitutional right, the exact figure might have
been given, provided there had been slaves
among the killed. But the persons here
alluded to were all white men; and in these
times of enlightened philanthropy human lives
are priceless, and we tide over the difficulty by
not counting them at all.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. At what
time was this?
Mr. DEGENER. Since the Government of
the United States reassumed its control over
the State of Texas; that is, since the summer
of 18C5 to May, 1870, embracing these five
years. Now, I believe I have shown that we
can justly clamor for a " better protection of
the Indian frontiers."
But, sir, do you want further evidence
besides the affidavits accompanying the peti-
tions? I will give it. In 1868 I implored
General Canby, then the military commander
of our district, to send more troops to our
bleeding frontier, laying before him the evi-
dence collected by the San Antonio committee.
He replied:
"I know all the given facts to be but too true. X
have them on record myself. But compare them
with the official records of crime and lawlessness in
the interior. There are more people killed in the
interior by white men than frontiersmen by Indians.
X must send my troops where they are most needed.
I have not enough to protect both."
Humiliating as it is for a Texan, I must
acknowledge the correctness of the general's
reply.
OUTLAWS.
But allow me, sir, to state in this connection
that nine out of ten outlaws who disgrace my
State are not Texans. They are the refuse of
the other States. Outlaws and fugitives from
justice will seek a refuge where they best can
hide themselves, and the vastness of our terri-
tory and the sparseness of out population
furnish ample opportunities. This has, how-
ever, changed. An efficient State police force,
selected mostly from our own citizens, under
the command of an officer who, though not a
Texan, has studied frontier life in the Indies
and in Africa, have pretty near cleaned out
the desperadoes. Two hundred and fifty men,
citizens who know'the country and have an
interest in its prosperity, have accomplished
in eight months, with the assistance of only
a small part of the military forces, what the
entire reconstruction army failed to accom-
plish in five years. We wish to make a sim-
ilar test with citizen soldiers, in cooperation
with the regular troops on our frontiers ; and
this is what we expect will prove a " better"
protection than that which we now enjoy.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. Will the
gentleman yield to me for two or three minutes?
Mr. DEGENER. If it does not come out
of my time and if the gentleman will not make
a motion to adjourn.
Mr, McCORMICK, of Missouri. Of course
not.
Mr. DEGENER. I have become cautious.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I wish to
call the attention of the gentleman to the second
section of this bill, which provides that the
