There are now in this depot over 2,000 serviceable artillery horses and over 1,000 cavalry horses for issue. There are over 10,000 other cavalry horses which will probably be fit for issue within sixty days, and about 1,000 which will answer for teams and ambulances. There are also some 2,000 in hospital, a part of which will be sold. There are also a considerable number in Northern depots which are kept there for convenience of forage. All approved requisitions from Sheridan's army, the Potomac, and the James have been filled. Sherman
