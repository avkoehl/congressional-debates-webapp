No blank muster-rolls have ever been received here. I have ordered one copy for each company to be ruled out, and the balance to be copied when the blanks are received.

SIR: Since my report of yesterday reliable information has come in to the effect that the enemy are deserting, or have deserted, all their positions north of the line from Bird's Point to Sikeston, and probably from there. This movement seems to have commenced on the 27th ultimo. Not hearing from General Prentiss, and learning the above facts, I have written to General McClernand, at Cairo, advising that Colonel Wallace proceed to Charleston, and reconnoiter from there, as directed to do, after a junction had been formed between this command and the one from Ironton. Should no instructions be received here different from any I now have, upon hearing of General Prentiss' arrival at Jackson I will order the column to move south under his command, and proceed myself to Bird's Point and take command there.
