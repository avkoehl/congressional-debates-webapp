Whereabouts id Green's division? It ought to be well on the way to Alexandria by this time. If it is still there retain Baylor's, Madison's, and McNeill's regiments. Lieutenant-General Smith directs you to send Buchels' and Terrell's regiments to General Taylor immediately, in addition to Brown's and Pyron's; these four regiments to report to General Green. He also directs that you hold the balance of your cavalry (except Baylor's, Madison's, and McNeill's regiments) ready to move at a moments' notice.
