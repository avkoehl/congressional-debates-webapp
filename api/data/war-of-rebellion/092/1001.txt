General Martin is in Mississippi in arrest by General Wheeler. Brigadier-General Kelly was killed in Tennessee; Humes is with Wheeler; Jackson's division is with Hood. I will write more fully soon as practicable.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

RICHMOND, VA., December 29, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charleston, S. C.:

A telegram just received from Augusta states that General Wright has called for all able-bodied men in the cotton factories. The Secretary of War directs that the artisans shall not be disturbed; they must be kept at work to meet the necessities of the service.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CHARLESTON, December 29, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Column of enemy which moved a few days since toward Altamaha bridge, on Gulf railroad, is reported to have returned to Savannah, where Kilpatrick is said to be. Nothing of importance reported from that direction. No report of operations from General Hood since 3rd instant.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

WILMINGTON, December 29, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Charleston:

The two battalions I desired to be returned were taken from the regular garrisons of our forts, and their absence embarrasses us much in working the heavy guns. You will observe I do not ask for the infantry. It will be better to send the artillery back, and I have already asked authority to send you other re-enforcements in case you should need them. The fleet has entirely disappeared, and all is quiet here.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

CHARLESTON, December 29, 1864.

Major-General WHEELER,

Hardeeville:

Lieutenant-General Hardee approves your proposition to have your advance line run from New River bridge to Izard's, and to blockade the roads below that line.

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
