the sum he asked, 01 any other bum There was no scarcity of
money The money was abundant, but there was one place
Where there wasalwayaa greatscaicity, and that waoin the
brokers' shops Their language was proverbia! The Jew bro-
ker, in a play or ir a romance, always told the piofiigate young
heir that "monish was very scatce " But letan olhcerol tne
Government come forward not to tne brokeis, but to the com-
munity, and he would find that thtb counti y was not bankrupt,
that nothing was wantu g but confi lence Let good security be
provided, and Government could get as much money as it
"would ask
Mr I had been told by alatePiesident of the UnrtedStates,
that in the palmy days ofoui piospLr ty, when money was.
flowing into our Tieast ry in a spring title, he bad received
communications fiuuiEnglau ioffenng hjmany sum that could
bea«keda* an interest, oí two per cení on the single proviso
that the loan shouli navefifLyjt-ar  to run Such was the con
fidenre they then had in thiacotinuy [H>resome deep sighs

well ascertained fact i hit the grea English piopnriors, wealthy
noblemen like the Duke of Jitdimd, anl the Duke of fine

interest of not more than one cüd a h?!f pel cent So it was in
France, Hollard, and B«l;iait) Not the leist difficulty would
be experienced m obtaining money, piovided good secunty
was offered     Without this a 1 < ttempts must be vain
Mr I therefore, must conscientiously dec'are that, unless
secuuty should be pi ovule 1 bylaw, he cou'd \ote no bill either
foi loan or Treasuiy notes Without this ih^y would but ope

it wouU vanish like a morning mis. Mi I admitted that he
was not as devout as he ought lobe but ht. vvab o fatalist, and
he couU not doubt, consideiuig the long <J eri^hed and tpvete

to save the country Ihbiod was neie sa y, and we had It
with a vengeance The people nad beun wiuhing un ler it
long, and now at length the Governrmnt too, began to Icel He
would, however, refrain from any and t/veiy alius on that could
by possibility call up patty feeling.
A highly respectable young fiiend of his, a member fiom
Kentucky, [Mr MAHJSHALLjhadailuaed m a ret,p it speech to
a chain of causation His language on that occasion was not
hard to understand, and although Mr I wasawaie of his me
quality with that gentleman, wl en a propel day should come,
he would be ready to meet him upon that question of cau«a
tipn, and was prepaied to show that fiom 1790 to the piesenl
hour out monetary systt- n had been a sene* of jerks, expeii-
ments, and contrivances, which had ended as those things al-
ways didatid must end We misht wmkas haid as we pleased
at ¡acta which were uademabU-, but the result had come It
was upon us, upon our banks, u,)on our States, and now upon
the General Govei nment itself 1 he suffering was general, was
universal, but he believed that, the day oí íedemption had
come,if notnf comple p le iemption, at ltast of modified and
partial redemption O , n the day were not yet fuliy come, it
was at hand, at the doois, and the pte^tnt was one occasion
which the Committee of Way° and Means might have em
braced to commence the work of nji deliverance And now,
before he closed, might he be patdo ied m one pllubion to the
present Ad minis t tat ion? It seemed to have put lts-U upon the
countiy, and not upon any paity, or on any portion of that
House The expeument, he admitted, was bolo, and how
alone could it succepdí ( y bold measures He did not &ay
by vetoe , but be meant by informing the countiy fully of
all its difficulties, and by proposing the piopu expedients
to relieve them—not by buch a couespondence and such a
bill as this, which all must <>ec to be but a meie tern
porary expedient D.l any gentleman d > ibf that that

trampled upon the idea of repudiation—lo come up to their

been pui&ued without ending in rum
Mr EVERETT said he could truly say that he was in a
great strait with regard to the course h^ should pursue on
this bill He had heretofofp voted against eveiy bill ior the
issue of Treasury notes The first question was of personal
consistency, and that, on some occasions, with some persons,
had been deemed of very gi eat account In tie presentaste
of things, he *.as t'esirous to vote fur the prebent bill, if be
could, by a speech, satisfy himself that he ought to do so. He
was then a speiker and a Ustenei, hie remarks would be
more to satisfy himself than the Hou«e, and he was som°
what doubtful what would be (he je^u't It seemed to bean
admitted fact that we have no money m the Treasuiy It was
ptoposed by someto replenish the ÍVasury,by íeturmn? the
proceeds of the public Iands He was opposed to that The
same reasons which operated to cause the distribution to the
States, now remained to continue it He wis not go ng into
this argument but would simp'y state what the argument was
1 he lust reason was, that such was the o ismal trust, these
cend, that it wis in the peifoiniance of tht. <. mi promise act, of
which it wasa condition that tin-* money oould be withdiawn
fiom the general íesourcesof the countrj, and another r<a«on
was, to take this fund out of the political matket, where it had
been u^ed for electioneering purposes, and the list was, to af
ford something m the situation in which the States new were,
toenable them to suppoit their credit All the«e íea'-on**, in
his mind, still lemained He took it for granted, then that we
have no money, and cm Id not icly on that-ource foi replenish

this morning, had gone on the ground which eau^ed his (Mi
E's) opposition It wa' the veiy facility with uhich they may
be issued, and which disposed the Government to "ontinue
them, so that, instead of their being a temporiry i«sne, they
weieaptto becomea permarentresotnee of the countiy He
had heietoioie pieferred a loan but he bad always pieferred
raising money to boirowing, whether by a loan or the issue of
Treasury notes, he preferred always hav ing money to pay from
the resources of the countiy But m the way of borrowing
by a loan this time, there were peculiar embaí rassment'*
Notwithstanding what the gentleman from Penn=yIvama[Mr
C .1 IngersollI had said this morning, theie were times of
scarcity of money and of plenty n evpry country Whenpvei
the balance of ttade was against a countiv, 'here would be a
seal city of none), and whenever theie wpre otner objects oi
investment of'more profit than w?re oflured oy the count y,
there would be a scarcity to the Government He apprehended
thatcauses had operated, and were now opeiatwf to produce
an extraordinary scared v in thn country, one of which wai the
drain of money from this country, which had already taken .
place by the importation of wines and silks with a view to avoil
the tanffof last summer
On his way here, at Boston, he was toU that within the last six
weeks, one thud of thp capital of the binks there had been
taken and exported By this time probacy it had amounted to
onehilf, and he took it to be the same in New York This
cause of the scarcity of specie endangeied the banks in both
cities, and to him it was not an improbable opinion that the
banks in both cities and in the Etstern countiy, would m the
end be caused to suspend specie payments He bad understood
that immense ordeis had been given for foreign goods with the
hope of their arriving before the Hr of July, and, unless tiiere
was an act parsed botween this and Tuly ibprt wa-, no knowing
what would be the extent of the dr un of ppecie fi om tlm some

nothing but a revolution could put it down    He ivd been on
posed to all these ireasmes except urcei ca'-'-s of the most
uigent necessity, instead ot resomns cifher to Treasury notes
or loans they ought to lay sufficient duties lorthenece Sities of
the country.  That should be our íesource.
One difficulty under which we labored was the want tíf at
financial system We had none now either as to revenue or
cunency Hedid not knew that the prospect of creatingsuch
asystem had brightened by any thing ihat had recemjy trans-
pired He saw nothing encouraging, yet he did hope that thí 
C ingress would not rise until they endeavored to do something
on both these subject*, which would be effectual.                            *
He should propose an amendment, when it waa in order, to
limit the power ol the Executive under this bill to the present
session of Congress His object in this was to foice Congress
at this session to provide the necessary means for-sustaimng the
necessary expenditures of the country, aid lie did not know,
except undet cosent necessity, that Congiess would be induced
tidoit, buthedesned ihat the cusís  might come, either that
they should not pay themselves or any body else, or that they
should provide full means fot canymg on the Government
without resort to loans or Treasury notes It was perfectly
plain, if we were going on at this rate, that we should soon have
a loan of fifty millions, and then the difficulty ot relieving our-
selves from it would be much greater than that which now ex-
isted. He wasoppostd to all debts, ei'herby Treasury notes
oi a loan It was only as tempoidiyexped.ents that they should
be resorted to, and hp now said, if we could borrow money he
would vote against the issue of Ireasury notes and take a loan;
but being perfectly satisfied that they could not get a Joan, he,
had come to the conclusion that if his amendment was adopted,
limiting the powéi of the issue to the present session, he should
vote foi the bill, and if it was not adopted, he would notsay what
his rouise would be

Mr BARNARD said it had occurred to him, while thegert
tleman irom Philadelphia [Mr O S IiíOLrsoLLl who last ad
dressed the committee was speaking, how much they who were
m the Opposition in this House during the last Congress might
have gamed, if it had fao happened that that gentleman had suc-
ceeded in the earne&t andstienuous efFoit which he had made
to become a member of this House at that Congress It would
be remembered by those now here, and who then were here,
that in the course of that Congress they had two propositions
biought forward for the i*-sue of Treasuiy notes, which were
suppoited at that day by the entire voice and vote of the then
Admmibtration party The gen leman had now offered an
argument against the issue of Treasury notes, every part of
whieh would have been as iprlicabíe then as now, and which,
perhaps, might not have failed to umvince, as other argumenta
did fail to convir ce, the paity wi'h which the gentlemen now
acted, and would then have acted, of the impropuety of this po
licy The genileimn had objected to the issue of Treasury
n ues at this tirm , not, indeed, beeause the policy is improper
and ur justifiable undei any circumstances whatever, but be j
cause it is always improper to undeitake m any form to create ¿
a pubiic debt, with ut at the same time onXring to the public/
cieditor security He had argued that the state ofthe Treasury/
now, and the revenue and the condition oí the resources of Go/
vei nment, are such as to render it highly prohable that ifÁ
loan was now authorized, although under other\cireumstani 3
it would be taken, it would now be refused byithe capitalist
because ofthe want of sufficient security forhiswebt Surely
the gentleman could not have forgotten that the conditio*! in
which he now described the Treasuiy to he wasprecisely the
condition in which they were situated at the period to wh&hhe
(Mr B ) had alluded
