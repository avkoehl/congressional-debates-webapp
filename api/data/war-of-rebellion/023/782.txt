General BRAXTON BRAGG,Commanding Department No. 2:

GENERAL: Your letter of 24th instant came safely to hand last night. I am now fully committed to my advance policy, as two of my divisions will leave London tomorrow for Richmond. My intention is to push rapidly forward to secure the passage of the Kentucky River. If I can do this I think all will go well. My only concern is as regards re-enforcements, for though I have men enough to win one battle, yet if it should be a well-conducted one I may need a few recruits to enable me to reap the fruits of this victory; therefore, if it be possible, do send me Breckinridge with his Kentuckians. I shall instruct General McCown to prepare transportation with the view of his arrival at Knoxville.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.
