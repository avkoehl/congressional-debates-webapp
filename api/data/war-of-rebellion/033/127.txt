Will you please answer my letter in relation to disposing of condemned and other prisoners in Minnesota! Unless disposed of by sending out of State, large force will be required to guard and protect them from the citizens, and that force is absolutely needed for spring campaign. General Sibley writes my ungently on the subject, and no time should be lost, as military operations will be delayed.
