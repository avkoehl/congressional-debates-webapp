I shall occupy Vicksburg, and support Beauregard with all the men I can organize and arm.

General RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

Have received no instructions about destruction of cotton. Shall I destroy all that can be reached by the enemy, leaving each planter a portion for supplies; if so, what percentage shall be left? Shall I burn the barracks and arsenal at Baton Rouge?

M. LOVELL.

CAMP MOORE, LA., May 2, 1862.

Butler occupied New Orleans to-day. Cannot enroll men there. What is to be done about destroying cotton?
