SHIP-BUILDING.
See the effect upon commerce^ and ship-
building where it encounters foreign compe-
tition. Of our coastwise trade, under oar
navigation laws, our ship-builders have the
exclusive market. But ship-building for the
foreign trade, the registered tonnage under
present tariff laws, has fallen off and is almost
annihilated. Note the decline in foreign ship-
building :

I do not object to this bounty system in
States or localities that desire thereby to di-
versify their production. If a city or Slate
sees fit to tax all its inhabitants to create or
encourage a new employment, other cities and
States untaxed cannot complain j but the ben-
efits of manufacturing establishments to agri-
cultural pursuits are necessarily local. The
bounties exacted of agriculture and non-pro-
tected trades and employments accrue to those
portions of the Union where manufactures ex-
ist. The contributions from Alabama cotton-
planters and Minnesota wheat-growers swell
the profits of New England and Pennsylvania
capitalists.
Our tariff laws are unjust, not only in their
exactions and discriminations as to the trades
and industries of the country, but in the dis-
tribution of their benefits to different sec-
tions. The southern States are chiefly engaged
in the production or tobacco and cotton; the
Northwest in agricultural products, while the
chief export of the Pacific slope consists of
the precious metals. No tariff duties can
enhance the value of their products.
COTTON PRODUCTION.
The cotton States, according to the census
returns of 1870, produced 3,011,996 bales of
cotton, which at eighty dollars per bale would
be worth $240,000 000; the greater part of
which was exported abroad. The following
table shows the value of the products of each
State:

WHEAT PRODUCTION.
The northwestern States exported from their
own borders in 1870, 81,627,000 bushels of
wheat. 1 submit a table giving the surplus
produced by each of those States and required
by other portions of the Union, and the amount
shipped to Great Britain and other foreign
countries.

New England takes 13.000,000, New York
and New Jersey 11,000,000 more, and the
southern cotton States nearly 19,000,000 bush-
els ; while Great Britain and her possessions
took 43,405,000 bushels of wheat and flour, com-
puted as wheat, in exchange for her products.
We actually supplied over ten million of her
people with bread, which Pennsylvania refused
to take, sending three fourths of a million
bushels to compete with, ours.
STATES BENEFITED BY THE TARIFF.
What, portions of the Union receive the ben-
efits resulting from tariff duties? Where,
chiefly, are the iron, cotton, and woolen fab-
rics, salt and glass, and other protected arti-
cles produced ?
SALT.
The salt bounty amounts annually to $2,350,-
000 upon 20.000,000 bushels produced, of
which the Onondaga Salt Company claim
to have made 8,000,000 bushels, and con-
sequently receive a bounty of $900,000; no
insignificant bonus to a single county, and
appalling should the Empire State multiply
its demands by the number of its Represent-
atives.
IRON.
The secretary of the Bar Iron Association
estimates the value of the pig, railroad, bar,
and other iron manufactured in the United
States during the year 1871 at $184,022,500.
The enhancement of price upon the pig iron
is $13,000,000, and upon the whole at least
$40,000,000, and probably more.
Pennsylvania m 1860 produced sixty-two per
cent, of the pig iron, and sixty-four per cent,
of other iron manufactures in the United States.
Her production has increased with the general
increase in the country, so that the duties ou
iron secure for her citizens over $24,000,000,
and more than $20,000,000 of bounty above
the pro rata share of her citizens.
Our tariff laws, at present rates, exact fifty
cents for every man, woman, and child in the
nation to help work tlie mines and furnaces
and support tlie miners and iron-workers of
that State.
PAPER.
According to a statement furnished me by
Mr. Augustine Smith, a very intelligent paper
manufacturer of New York, there are 1,107
paper-mills in the United States, manufactur-
ing, according to his estimate, $110,700,000
worth of paper annually.
New England has 367 mills, and three States,
New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania,
500, being four fifths of the whole number.
The duty on printing paper is twenty per cent.
ad valorem, and on writing paper thirty five
per cent, ad valorem. The proportion manu-
factured of each kind is not given in the state-
ment furnished me. It is safe to estimate that
the price of the whole quantity is increased
one fifth by reason of the duty. The bounty
paid to the paper manufacturers would exceed
$22,000,000. This sum is assessed upon and
paid by the readers of books, periodicals, and
newspapers in the United States.
The New England States and the three States
named receive over $17,000,000 of this sum,
and over $10,000,000 above what their own
readers pay.
The following statement shows the total
amount of bounty received by certain States
through tariff duties, and paid by other States
to the manufacturers of paper:

The other twenty-eight States and the Ter-
ritories have 240 mills. Their tariff bounty
received would be, according to the estimate,
$4,666,000, and their contribution $14,938,000,
and their readers pay $10,278,000 more than
their manufacturers receive.
WOOL.
The wool tariff of 1867 was intended to give
twenty cents per pound protection on fine
domestic wool.
As the wool clip of 1870, according to the
United States census, was 101,000,000 pounds,
the protection, there-fore, or enhanced price
to consumers of wool, would be $20,000,000.
This benefit accrues almost entirely to seven
States in the Union. Vermont is able to
obtain $448,000; Ohio, $2,717,000; Michigan,
$1,151,000; Wisconsin, $446,000; and the
Pacific States about two million dollars more
than their own people pay. Seven States
obtain from the remaining thirty States of the
Union $7,000,000.
The consumption of wool is at least five
pounds per capita, and perhaps more in the
Northwestern States, and if the wool tariff
secured the designed cffect it would tax each
man, woman, and child one dollar on the wool
in the garments worn by them. The num-
ber of sheep in Illinois has diminished from
2,549,998 in 1867 to 1,073,497 in 1871. The
wool tariff seeks to tax the people of Illinois
$2,500,000 and pay her wool-growers $600,000,
taking from her citizens $1,900,000 for the
wool growers of other Statps. The third con-
gressional district of Illinois had 120,178 sheep
in 1867 and 48,741 in 1871. The wool-grow-
ers of that district are promised by the wool
tariff $30,000, while its citizens are expected
to pay $157,299, being a loss to the district of
$128,054. What equity or justice is there iu
this!
WOOLENS.
The best estimates of woolen manufacturers
place the value of the product of their indus-
try for the year 1870 at $175,000,000. The
average duty for woolen cloths was sixty-nine
per cent, in gold, which would be about equal
to seventy-five per cent, in currency; so that
if the tariff secures the protection designed,
three sevenths of the value of this product^ is
the increased cost resulting from the tariff.
Deduct $25,000,000 as the enhanced cost of
domestic and imported wool consumed by
manufacturers, and two sevenths of the value
of the production is tariff bounty. In other
words, manufacturers of woolen goods, under
the present tariff laws, secure from the people
a bounty exceeding $-50,000,000, of which
over $20,000,000 are collected by seven States
from the remaining States of the Union. Mas-
sachusetts receives over $7,000,000 from other
States, besides what her manufacturers collect
from her own farmers and producers.
COTTONS.
The value of the domestic cotton produced in
the United States in 1870 is estimated at
$165,000,000, on which the duty is equal to
forty per cent ad valorem in gold, or forty-five
per cent currency, and now the enhanced
price charged to consumers equals $51,000,000.
The cotton manufacturing is canied on prin-
cipally in the same States as the woolen. Of
the cotton bounty received by manufacturers,
$35,728,566 is paid to those .States. Rhode
Island collects $7,165,262. Massachusetts
$17,147,617. and the other New England States,
except Vermont. $35,436,488. I submit a
fable showing the bounties received and con-
tribution paid by different States and portions
