if you are in time. We want to cross south of Bridgeport, penetrate between Rome and Chattanooga. Let us have full co-operation. Telegraph me position, progress, and plan.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Stevenson, August 19, 1863.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville:

The demand for the use of contrabands far exceeds the supply. I am obliged to defer some very important railroad work until I can get a supply. Am sorry I cannot help you.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

CRAB ORCHARD, August 19, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

An order has been received at General Boyle's headquarters directing him to send away all of the orderlies at his headquarters. This order will sadly cripple the service and interfere with the public good, and I hope you will not insist upon it. Answer.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, August 19, 1863.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Crab Orchard:

There is no man whom I would oblige sooner than yourself, but I think the practice of detailing men, commissioned officers and soldiers, to serve outside the limits of their command is so prejudicial to the interests of the service and of the soldiers that if the order spoken of in your dispatch has been issued by the War Department, I think it should be obeyed. I can readily understand temporary inconvenience it will occasion, but think it can soon be remedied.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

LOUISA, August 19, 1863.

Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Crab Orchard:

GENERAL: There has been no move as reported. A few scattering bands have come through Pound Gap. They have a force in the gap. A detachment of the Fourteenth Kentucky met Captain Cook, of Preston's command, in Morgan County, routed them, capturing 20 horses, on the 11th. Will keep you informed of any forward movement. I am strengthening my position, and think I can hold it against three times my number.

Yours, respectfully,

GEO. W. GALLUP,

Colonel, Commanding Eastern District of Kentucky.
