intention of the Constitution is that cch State
should be represented, and that a decís on
against their right would be productive of great
inconvenience and haidship to the people of Mis-
sippi, I beg leave to give one or two rules of con-
struction laid down by Mr Livingston m his able
speech on the subject of the Turkish mission
" I consider (said Mr. L ) it (meaning the Consti
tntion) as I would any other written instrument,
by its words «hen they are explicit, when tnere is
doubt, bj the context, by the plain object of its
framers, by a view of the evils it intended to
remedy " Again, " I must not be understood as
saying that an itico ívemence attending any con-
struction is sufficient to bhow it to bp false, or that
to be the true reading whi"h avdds it When
the words are express, when the intention ib e i
dent, however inconvenient, the} must be obejed "
HerP) Mi Speaker, with these rules to guide us,

But no ieep penetration into fntmitv was re
quired to make these piepneeus I mil existing
causes shall be removed the fature mi st be the
counterpart of the past
Whence this eternal vicissitude in the business
of the country J What is the seei"t spring of all
these calamities 1 I answer, the spirit of enterprise,
so natural to American citizens, excited into fuuous
action by the stimulus of exce&sive banking It
operates as does the inhaling of ox}gen gas upon
the hunrm mind, urging it on to every extrava
gance and to every foil}
I do not deny that several subordinate circum
stances have operated in unison with this grand
cause, to make the present catastiophc more sevue
han it otherwise might have been Still it is the
root of all the evil It is the chief and almost the only
source from which the existing distress has flowed
I w as not a member of this bod} when the dis
eussion took place on the veto of the bank chartor
or the removal of the deposites Although both
these measures received m} coidial approbation,
yet I refram purposely from r°pl} mg, at this late
period, to the remarks which have been made on
these subjects They have airead} passed into
history, and been sanctioned by the public approba-
tion
Amongst these subsidiar} causes of *ne existing
distress may be enumerated tne destruction of
capital by the great fire at New York in December,
1835 The wild speculations m public lands, and
in splendid towns and cities upon piper throughout
the western States which withdrew capital from
the commercial cities, where it was most wanted to
portions of the country w here it was not required,
and the specie circular, if you p1 ea.se, which how
ev er w íse it may have been in its origin, ought
noi in m} opinion, to hav e been continued in force,
after it had peifoimed its office and had checked
the wild «peculations m public lands Ivo'edm
favor of the bill at the la°t sess on which íepealed
this circular, and, undei the same circumstances,
I would again act m the same manner But pei
rait me to sav that its effects hav e been greatly e\
aggerated It did not carr} to the west anv thing
appioachmg the amount of gild at d sih or which
Senators nave estimated According totheicport
of the Secretary of the Treasury, all the specie m
all the western cienositebanks including Michigan,
but little exceeded four millions of dolíais at the
date of the suspension of specie pa} ments, anel m
the southwestern deposite banks it did not amount
to one million two hundreel thousand dollars I
shall not «top to inquire how much less gold and
silver there would have been m these depositories
had the specie circular never existed Certain it
is that the comparatively small amount of specie,
which came into these banks m consequence of 'his
circular could have produced but an mconsidera
hie effect oi t1 e ' a mess of our cc mine en] ci* es
tml su]] kss upon the suspension of specie pa}
ments
These causes mav have made the revulsion a
little moie severe, but had thev nevei existed, still
it must have come with desolating foice
Senators have atti íbuted some portion of the ex
isting disticss to the act of 1814 legnla'mg the
standard of our gold coins They have not told
us and they cannot tell us how this act could have
produced such an effect It was nopai ty measure,
and upon its passage there were but few, I bi heve
seven, v otes against it ¡n the Senate It w as a mea
suie of absolute necessity, if we desned that our
own gold co ns should ev ei circula e m this coun
ti> Before its passage a half eagle a« an arliele
of merchandise was intiinsically worth about five
dol'ars and tlm v three cents m silver v hilst us
standard value as cmienev undpr om law x as
on!} five dollars It is manifest therefrre that
eagles ana h'lf eagles nevei could have en erpd
into general circulation, had it not been for the
passage of this act which is now condemned It
w as a mere adjustment of the relativ e v alue of gold
to silver accordmgto hestandaidof o her nations,
and if Iain not greatlv mistak n in my memoiv,
conformed exact!} m this pellicular with the
law s of Spam and Portugal
I hav c been utleil} at a loss to conocrve the cause
of the hostihtv of Senators to this necc «ary mea
sure unless it be from a feeling similar to that
which it is s id made a distinguished gentleman
desne to kil' ever} sheep whi< h came m his way
He could feel nopeisonal bosubtv to these mno
cent and harmless animals but was si eh a violent
anti tariff man that ti e sight of them ahva}s re
minded him of our wooden manufactures Cer
tamly no gentleman can entertain am objection to
the eagles and haK eagles themselves, butthey may
remind Senators of the efficient and untiring exer
uons of the Senator from Missouri (Mr Benton)
to introduce a goM curiency mto'euculation As
gold thev may like these corns, but as Bentoman
mint diops, they are detestable
Senators have also contended that the present
depressed condition of the country has been pro-
duced, in some degree, b} the Jarge importations
of specie which weie encomaged by the adminis-
tration of General Jackson I shall not be diverted
from my mam purpose by answering this objection
in detail Even if their position were correct
which I by no means admit, that more gold and
sihei had been forced mto the countr} than our
necessities demanded or the fixed laws of trade
woukl have justified still the effect would have
been transient and trifling It would have imme-
diately flowed back through the channels, of com-
merce to the places fiom whence it came, until the
par of exchange had been resto) ed This is one
of the fixed and invanabl law s of trade, from the
obligation of which we can never be released
IheSenaor from Kcutuck} , (Mr CLiY)inthe
course of his rema!ks upon this subject, involved
himse'f in a strange contiaeliction At the com-
mencement of his speech he demeeated, with his
usual eloquence and ahility, the pohev ol the past
admmistntion in forcing specie into this country
contrary to the law sof trade Towards the conclu-
sion when his fancy became excited by the con-
templation of the splendid bank of the Uni ed Slates
winch it was his purpose to establish he seemed
entirely to have changed his opinion In order to
obtain the necessary amount of specie capital, he
proposed that some wenty or twenty-five millions
of this bank stock should be transmitted to Europe
and sold to foreigners in exchange for gold and sil-
v er It w as a violation of the law s of trade, w hieh
must recoil upon us, to force a g-eater amount of
specie into the counti} than our just proportion,
for the puipose of putting if m'o circulation among
the peopie but when the pu pose is to furnrm a
specie eapiial of ttventv oi txvent fi e millions foi
a n"\v bank of the United S ates, then all difficul-
ties vanish from the mind of the gentleman
No, sir said Mr B , without the agency of any
of these secondaiy causes, the present distress must
have come It was inevitable as fate No law of
nature is more fixed, than that our over hanking
and our over trading must have produced thedi«as
trous results under which we are now suffenng
Is there now in any of our large commercial
cities such an individual as a regular impoitingor
commission merchant1! I mean a merchant who is
conten* to grow rich, as oui fatners d d bv the suc-
cessive and regu ar profits of many }ears of mdus
tr} in his own peculiar pursuit If theie be such
persons they are iaie No, sir all desire to grow
rich lapidh Each tal Cs Ins chance in the lotteiy
of specula ion Although there ma} be a hundred
chances to one against him each eagerl} intent
upon the golden prize, overlooks the intervening
locks and quicksands between him and it and,
when he fond!} thinksheisabouttoclutchn hesmks
mtobankruptcy and ruin Such has been the fate of
thousands of our most enterpnsing citizens It is
enough to make one s ncart bleed to contemplate the
blighted hopes and ruined piospectsof those who
have fallen victims to the demon of speculation
Manv of them ha'e 1 een the mostpiomismg, and,
but for this fatal enoi would have become the most
useful citizens of oui countr} Undei the influence of
thisfcchng the} not only risk their own all butoften
the all of other  winch has been confided to them,
not as I firmly believe, with anv del herate purpose
of being disnonest hut in the confident but delu
siv e hope that foi tune mav smik upon their efforts
and enable them to meef all their lesponsibinties
Par be it from me to utter one w ord against the
profession of the meichant Bv then ability and
enteipnse our merchants have cast lustre upon the
chaiacter of our country throughout the world
T! p\ arp a rongst our most u eful citirens They
are agents foi exchanging our productions with
distant nations and am ng ourselves Commerce
is the handmaid of agriculture and manufactuies,
and Heaven forbid that I should be the instrument
of exciting hostility between them Again I am.
the last man ip the countrv who wou'd crush that
spirit of enterpiise and of untiring effort which be-
longs to the Amencan character It has produced
miracles It has covered every sea with our flag
With arapiditv unexampled in the history of the
world it has converted the wi'derness mto fruitful
fields an i flourishing towns and cities It has
erected splendid improvements of every kind    It
