HDQRS. FIRST Brigadier, SEVENTH DIV., CAVALRY MISSISSIPPI, Near Columbia, December 22, 1864.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

MAJOR: Pursuant to an order to examine to railroad and bridges from my encampment to Duck River, and including Duck River bridge, I sent two officers for that duty. They report the track in good condition; three bridges burned-one of 160 feet length trestle, one 200 feet, and one 250 feet; the last entirely washed away, so that they could not reach Duck River bridge. They are devising measures to reach the river bridge, and will do so in a short time. I will then give a detailed reported of the condition of the whole track.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brevet Brigadier-General.

(Forwarded to Major-General Thomas.)

CHRISTIANA, December 22, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I have just reached this point after being detained forty-two hours at Murfreesborough waiting transportation from the south. The delay was no doubt occasioned by the damage to the road by enemy. The enemy occupied Decatur on night of December 20, by a force estimated at from 2,000 to 4,000 said to be Roddey's. I will cross my force on transports above Decatur, drive him out, and move to Florence as fast as possible.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Major-General.
