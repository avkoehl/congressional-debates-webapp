Mr  EVERETT.   1 give notice U t I shall offer it on Mon-

Mr MALLORY. I object to the resolution, and the motion
too
So the resolution, being objected to, was not received.
Mr STEENROD, having voted in the affirmative on t&e-mo-
tion to lay on the table the resolution authorizing the CottftlHi-
tee on Private Land Claims to employ a clerk, morad aracon
sideration of that vote, with a view, he was understood to"-say,
of hearing any suggestions that the Committee might desire to
make
And, the question being on the motion to reconsider,
Mr. CROftS rose and said, at the time the question waitatai
on laying on the table the resolution to give the Committee on
Private Land Claims the aid of a clerk, he was not in blá seal:
if he had been piesent, it was his intention to have submitted
some remarks for the consideration of the House He now
hoped the House would agree to reconsider the vote just taken.
The committee was required to do duties for private individuals
—their attention was directed to cases in which private indivi-
duals were inteiested—and ofí each case they had to prepare a
report asa lawyer would prepare a casefoi trial m a court of
law By their attention to these duties, they were unable to
look into the general business before the country, and injustice
was done to their immediate constituents In addition, there
were many cases sent to them in the Spanish and French Ian.
guages, which the members of the committee had neither the
time nor the knowledge to tianslate, but this might be done by
a suitable clei k There were about four hundred cases before
the committee,and unless the House would affoidthem the faci-
lity wl 'ch they required, he should withdraw from further ser-
vice upon it, he believed his duty to his immediate constituents
requiret! this
Mr YOUNG of New York rose to sustain the motion to re-
consider, and said he thought that, if gentlemen would look into
the duties of that committee, they would no longer doabt as to
the propnetyor necessity of allowing a clerk
JHr Y was proceeding to remark on the vast amount of busi-
ness before the committee, and to say that many of the case 
were of the most intricate character-
When Mr HOPKINS submitted to the Speaker whether it
was in order to go into a debate on a motion to reconsidera
motion to lay on the taWe? [which latter motion is not itself de-
batable ]
The SPEAKER said that, strictly speaking, the debate was
not in order
Mr MALLORY moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table
Mr TURNEY also rose and submitted the same molion, re.
marking, as the Reporter understood, that though himself a
member of this committee, he did not believe the employment
of a clerk to be necessary
And the question being taken on this motion, it was deemed
inthenegative withouta division
So the motion to reconsidei was not laid on the table
And the question recuriing on the motion to reconsider—
Mi   TURNEY asked the yeas and nays, which weie re-
fused
Tellers weie called for and ordered, and Mes is. Smith and

So the vote by which the resolution had been laid on the ta.
bl  was reconsidered                                                                     .

So the resolution was laid on the table
Mr. MERIWETHER asked leave, in puisuance of notice

The SPEAKER said it could only be done by general con.

On leave given, Mr MALLORY presented the petition of
William I  Bryant for a back pension
Mr GIDDINGS (the morning hour having elapsed) moved
that the House resolve itself into Commiitee of the Whole for
