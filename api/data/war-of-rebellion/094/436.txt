Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Has the Twenty-eighth Michigan got over the measles? If so, send it to General Schofield.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NASHVILLE, December 30, 1864

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

The Forty-seventh and Forty-eighth Missouri have been sent by rail as far as Spring Hill,but can get no farther. They have not a wagon or ambulance, and can get no assistance at Columbia, on account of scarcity of teams there. The quartermaster's department here cannot issue wagons before next Wednesday. The quartermaster and a detachment of each regiment have been detained here, to draw the teams and take them forward ladened with supplies when issued. I would send the regiments forward without teams, if they could supply themselves after reaching Pulaski. The Forty-fifth Missouri is now acting guard to the advance depot.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.
