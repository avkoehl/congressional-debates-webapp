lands be urged with equal force against this crite-
rion of value now fixed as the minimum ? The
truih is, if the Government is willing to let the
lefuse lirds become private property upon any
terms, the only means by which it can ever be ac-
complwl ed is to sell them, after having remained
so many years unsold, a¡> to prove that they will
not command trie piesent minimum atlower prices
thin tnose at which the good lands are sold This
has been the policy pursued by the States owning
public lands, and ought to be adopted by the Uní
ted States It is the only Way to dispose of refuse
lands
This bill was emphatically the poor man's bill,
and although the individual who now owned lands
would be enabled to add to them a half section at
the reduced prices if the provibion then under con-
sideration was adopted, yet the great object and
purpose of the bill was to enable those who could
not afford to purchase the publicland at the present
minimum, to buy a home at such a price, or upon
such terms, as their limited means justified The
members of the Committee on the Public Lands
who supported this bill, had been extremely anx-
ious to bring down the lands which had been fif-
teen years in the market to fifty cents per acre
He had desired the adoption of this provision more
than any other But the Senators fiom the old
States, who were willing to reduce the price of the
public lands giadually, had objected most posi
tively to a reduction below seventy five cents at
this time, and although these Senators would go
with the Senators from the new States to thatpomt,
they were prepared to vote against the whole bill
if this reduction was at this time insisted on He
had, therefore, with the other Senators from the
new States, consented to give up that provision of
the bill, hoping, however, that when the effect of
the piesent bill was asceitained, and, as he be-
lieved it would be found to do, to enable the Gov-
ernment to sell much of the public lands that could
not otherwise be sold, that then hehoped Congress
would consent to íeduce the price still further, and
would be willing to bring down the lands remain-
ing unsold for a number of years, io fifty, twenty-
five, and even twelve and a half cents per aeie
It is objected that this measure will unsettle the
price of land throughout the country This was
a great mistake The first cost of wild lands had
no influence upon the price of improved lands or
of lands in a setiled country. It has been said
here, that all the public lands, after they are im
proved, run up to ten, fifteen, and twenty dollars
an acre If this is true, what effect, he would ask,
would a reduction of twenty five oi fifty cents
m first cost of the land, have upon lands selling
at those prices' None whatever The Gov
eminent has no desire to speculate m lands, and
ought not to wish to avail itself of the pi oceeds of
the labor and expenditures of her citizens, after
they have done so much towards clearing and
cultivating then lands, and opening the country
It should have a fixed price for wild land of first
quality, and lower prices for her second, third,
and fourth-rate lands No better plan than that
now proposed can be adopted for attaining this
object. This principle should be ingrafted upon
our system, and now that our population had ex-
tended nearly m all directions to our limits, (for
he did not take into view the unoccupied country
towards and beyond the Rocky mountains, at pres-
ent given up to the Indian tribes,) he thought this
was the proper time to make this change in the
land system, unless, indeed, we wish to drive the
people to seek homes in foreign countries The
objections to the bill had been already so ably
answered, and us details so fully discussed, that
he would notgomto thesubjectfurther He hoped
that as this was a measure of vita! importance to
the new States, and was at the same time so just
and reasonable, it would meet the sanction of the
Senate.
WISCONSIN CONTESTED ELECTION.
DEBATE IN THE  HOUSE.
January 5, 1839
Mr MASON, of Ohio, asked leave to present
a resolution, which was read as follows
" Resolved, That the Hon. Gsorge W. Jones,
¡ate Delegate from the Territory of Wisconsin, is
not entitled to his mileage and per diem allowance
for his attendance at the present session
Mr WISE objected, whereupon
Mi MASON said as it was a matter of some
impoitance, he would move that the rules be sus-
pended, and uoon which motion, he called forthe
yeas and nays
The SPEAKER stated that he had received a
communication upon the subject from Mi Jones,
and would piefer that the House would come to
some decision upon it He then laid before the
House tne following letters, which weie read
House of Represektatives, )
Januaiy 4, 1839      )
Sir   I take this mode of informing you that a
resolution will, at the earliest opportunity, oe in-
troduced to this House, denying your right to re
ceive any compensation ks Delegate to the present
session of Congress
I am, sir, with respect,your obedient servant,
J R GIDDINGS
Hon George W Joves, Washington City
Washincton City, DC,)
Januaiy 5, 1839      $
Sir- Considering myself entitled, under the
usages of the House, and the laws of the United
States, to receive my mileage and per diem com-
pensation as the sitting Delegate from theTeuitory
of Wisconsin, X íeceived from the Sergeant-at-
Arms, on the 20th ultimo, a-check on the Bank of
Washington for my mileage and per diem allow-
ance up to that date
Having received last evening the accompanying
communication from a member of tne House,
Hon J R Gimhngs, of Ohio, and not feeling
willing to retain m my hands the compensation
alluded to unless most cleaily so entitled, I respect-
fully return to the House, through you, the on
gmal check, to be canceled by the House, if in
their judgment I am not entitled to it
1 came here under the solemn conviction that I
was the rightful Delegate of the people of Wiscon
sin, to serve them heie as such until the 4 h of
March next This opinion was strengthened by
the advice of able counsel, before and since my
airival here I entertain the same opinion still,
but will submit to the decision of the House in
both cases without a murmur
Very íespectfully, your obedient servant,
GEO W  JONES
Hon James K  Polk,
Speaker of the House of Representatives
The SPEAKER, with the peimibsion of the
House, made a brief explanation of thecouise of
the Seigeant at-Arms and the Piesidmg Officer of
the House
By the Journal of the extra session, at the open
ing of the present Congiess, m September, 1837,
ltappeaied that "George Wallace Jones appealed
'as the Delegate from the Territory of Wiscon-
1 sin, was sworn to support tne Constitution of
' the United States, and took a seat in the House "
No certificates of election of members or Delegates
were presented at the time of qualification, and
the Speaker could not know under what authority
they took their seats Mr Jones was sworn, and
took a seat
At the commencement of the present session,
Mr  Jones appeared in his seat, claiming to be the
rightful sitting Delegate from Wisconsin    When
the claim of Mr  Doty was presented, Mr  Jones
rose in  his  place and asserted  his right    The
House  by its acquiescence, recognized him as the
sitting Delegate, and toolc order m the case, by
referring the claim to a seat as the Delegate from
Wisconsin to the Committee of Elections    Mi
Jones continued in his seat as the sitting Delegate
He, at various times, as the Journal shows, pre-
sented petitions and resolutions, and participated
in the business of the House as the sitting Delegate
This was permitted by the acquiescence of the
House, until the right to the seat was decided by
the House     Whilst Mr Jones was thus the sit
ting Delegate, m his seat, in discharge of his du
ties as such, the Sergeant-at Arms or the Presiding
Officer had no right or power to inquire whether
he was rightfully there  That was a question which
the House alone coald decide    The law regulat-
i mg the pay of members and Delegates, for aught
I that appeared on the recc-d, entitled him to his
compensation until the time he was ousted by a
vote of the House- He called for his compensa-
tion, and neither the feeigeant at Arms nor the
Speaker hid any d creltou to refuse it under the
i law The check for his compeisation was made
out m the usual way, by the Serjeant at-Arms,
and signed under the law fei ice takmc thechait
this n ormng, tne H'er from Mr Joneb nad been
laid on his table And row the question of com-
pensation, undei tre resolution oeforethe House,
was an open one The House alone can, by its
order, refuse the compensation Under the law,
the Sergeant at Arms and Speaker cannot The
Speakei expressed the hope that the House would
decide the question, and thus leheve the subject
from all doubt and embarrassment
Mi MASON, after some introductory re-
marks, proceeded to review the circumstances un-
der which Mr Jones claimed his compensation
Fie stated that Mi J had returned to Wisconsin,
and had thrown himself upon the suffrages of the
people at the late election, when he was defeated
by the election of Mr Doty, who, as a matter of
course, came on and claimed his seat But, not-
withstanding that, Mr Jones had also come on,
claiming to serve for the present session j although
he knew that Mr Doty had the cert ficateof elec-
tion from the Governor of the Territory
Mr M then referred to former cases of con-
tested elections, and more particularly to tho^e of
Moore and Newland, to show that the compensa-
tion to unsuccessful claimants had been allowed
on entirely different grounds, theie being, in those
instances, a dispute as to who had beerr legally
elected, whereas, in the piesent case, there was
no demur to the fact of Mr Doty having been
elected by the people of Wisconsin at the recent
election He contended that Mr Jones had not
the ^lightest ground to claim a seat for a third
session, and that to allow him his mileage and
per diem allowance would be establishing a bad
piecedent He hoped the House would not allow
the claim, especially as the sitting Delegate must
be allowed the same He maintained that there
was no more ground for Mr Jones to claim tbe
compensation than there would be for ex mem
bers of Congress to demand pay for the «isoing
session after their teim of set vice had expired
After   some   remarks   from Mr    BOULDIF
against the resolution,
Mr   BRONSON Said he believed it had beeu
the invariable piactiee of the Hctuse, in all cases
of contested elections, to pay the expenses of both
c'aimants    He asked the House to consider tha
effect of disallowing such claims, until the ques-
tion Vías settled as to which was legally entitled
to the seat    Mr   Jones had come on under an
honest conviction, supported by high legal  ad
vice, that he had a right to sit during tbe presenl
session, the House had received fend recognized
1 him as such   and until it was decided otherwise,
he was constitutionally entitled to his compema
tion as such, the Piesidmg Officer having no right
to call in question the claim   He (Mr B ) denied
that this was a clear case, and that Mr Jones had
no right to come     The case was far from being
1 clear, so much so that for some time the commit-
tee was much perplexed about tbe proper eon-
I struction of the law relating to the elections of
. Wisconsin     He considered that, under the cir-
' cumstances, Mr Jones, or any other gentleman,
was perfectly justifiable m asserting his claim to
a seat for the piesent session     He was sure that
no good lawyer could be found who would say
I that it was a clear case, and, as m his opinion,
I Mi   Jones had strong grounds for making this
claim, he felt bound to vote for his compensa-
tion
Mr WISE said he should votew favor of allow-
ing to Mr Jones his pay, as itwasthedutytof the
House so to do That gentleman was the prima
facie Delegate fiom Wisconsin, and, under those
circumstances, neither the Sergeant-at Arras, the
Speaker, nor any one else, had á right to deny
that Mr Jones was entitled to his money Until
the House decided otherwise, he was the constitu-
tional representative of that Territory, and as such
entitled to the usual remuneration for his services
The Speaker and Sergeant-at-Arms fesd properly
