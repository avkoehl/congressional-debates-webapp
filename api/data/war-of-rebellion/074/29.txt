corps, not then occupied by our troops, General Blair reported, would swell the number of their dead on his front to 2.000. The number of dead buried in front of the Fifteenth Corps at the time the report was made was 460, and the commanding officer reported at least as many more yet unburied. The number of dead buried in front of the Sixteenth Corps was 422. They also reported in the hands of the corps over 1,000 wounded. Accompanying this report is a sketch* of the field of battle, showing the principal positions. During the night I re- enforced that portion of the Seventeenth Corps which occupied Bald Hill. Before morning the enemy withdrew from the small part of the field which they held on our left.

General Cox's division, of the Twenty- third Corps, which was stationed on the Decatur road, was relieved in the morning. Although the division was not engaged, I am under obligations to General Schofield for the promptness with wich he responded to my request for re- enfocements. Subsequently, by order of Generla Shrman, the Augusta railroad, from Decatur to our picket- line, was thoroughly destroyed by the First Division of the Fifteenth Army Corps; a refused intrenched line was constructed by the pioneers of the Fifteenth Corps, extending from the left of the line, held by the Twenty- third Corps, and, in pursuance of orders from headquarters Military Division of the

Mississippi, I withdrew the Army of the Tennessee the night of the 26th, and moved it along the rear of the center and right of the army to a position across Proctor's Creek. After putting the army in position that night I was relieved by Major General O. O. Howard. I call your attention to the accompanying map* of the field of battle, and the consolidated report of casualties.

I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. LOGAN,
