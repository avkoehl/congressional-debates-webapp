Colonel J. G. PARKHURST,

COLONEL: Inclosed I send you certain papers by which you will see that Generals Forrest and Roddey propose an exchange of prisoners; also a copy of a telegram from Lieutenant-General Grant authorizing such exchange, but leaving the arrangements still to be perfected.* The major-general commanding directs that you proceed to Eastport or Gravelly Springs, communicate with General Forrest by flag of truce, and make such arrangements as you can for this exchange, keeping in view the wishes of this department as expressed in the telegram of the lieutenant-general.

Regarding the permission for people to bring their cotton within our lines and take out the necessaries of life, that matter will be left to the Treasury Department. You will also ascertain whether it is practicable to effect an exchange of Roddey's men as he desires.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
