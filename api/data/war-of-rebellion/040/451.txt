Has any arrangement beenmde to recover our wounded soldiers and officers who fell into the hands of the enemy? Some arrangement can probably be effected through Colonel Ludlow, the anget for exchange, at Fort Monroe. But I desire to know your wishes before giving him instructions.

Provision has been made for having our wounded, properly cared for here. They are now in houses near Chancellorsville, and to-day medical attendance and supplies will be sent there. As soon as the river is fordable, they will be brought to this camp.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Thanks for your telegram. May I ask if storm and rise of Rappahannock determined Hooker's recrossing?

Governor ANDREW,

Boston, Mass.:

When General Hooker's official report is made it will no doubt answer all inquiries. The two causes mentioned were proximate and sufficient. What influences, if any, were exercised by other causes, I am unable to state. It is certain that he was not driven across by the enemy, or for want of force. Information has been received of the safe return of Stoneman's command.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

Falmouth, Va.:

General Dix had moved his troops before he received my order to suspend his operations, and probably occupied West Point in force yesterday.
