THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 3,
their own expense, carrying their provisions in
their wallets, without tents, with no shelter from
the piercing night save a single blanket, their
humble request is to be rejected without even an
inquiry, whilst those who fought on this side the
mountains have been so freely provided for.
It could not be that greater devotion to their
country had characterized the soldiers of the East
and the North, than those of the West; a more
striking instance of genuine patriotism could not be
found either in the history of this country or any
other, than that displayed by some early settlers
(intruders as they were termed) upon the vacant
lands in EastTennessee. They were removed in
a large body by a military force despatched for the
purpose, under Major Bradly, some short time pre-
vious to the defeat of General St Clair Sir, these
very men, although they had just beheld their
families in the most distressing possible situation,
naked, houseless, and starving, were among the
first to volunteer in the expedition then contem-
plating, and met their fate in the ensuing campaign
gallantly fighting for the very Government that
had just driven them from their cabins
Sir, from the brief history of facts I have given,
it will be seen that down to the year 1795, no gen-
eral cessation of hostilities had occurred, and that
the savages were continually urged by British
emissaries, to the commission of the most brutal
outrages I have given this sketch to satisfy the
honorable member from Rhode Island, and the
House, that in no point of view can this long and
protracted war be deserving of the character he
has seen proper to bestow upon it
If at any period it had assumed a predatory
character, the fault was in the Government, and
not in the inhabitants of the frontier. They were
left alone to defend themselves against the public
enemy, and at the same time by their own labor
and exertions to procure the necessaries of life for
the subsistence of their families It is well known
that after the treaty of peace with Great Britain in
1783, the Government could control neither men
nor means, and consequently these people were
compelled for some years to defend the lives and
property of all around them, as they best could,
from their own resources
I have aimed in my remarks, sir, at nothing
more than the performance of an act of simple
justice to the surviving representatives of foitner
days, so unjustly and unfeelingly denounced as
lobbers and plunderers
Whether the resolution shall ultimately prevail
or not, I hope their services at least may be
regarded in a propel light By their valoi, their
constancy, their unshrinking fortitude, a title to
the whole wide spread countiy of the West was
secured In giving protection to an extensive
frontiei, of which they constituted the only means
of succor and defence, every danger, every pri-
vation, every toil was encountered without mur-
mur or complaint Year after year tbeyfieely
suffered, their only reward the waim and heart
felt prayer oí the lonely woman and her offspring
acknowledging their preservation from captivity,
violation, and detth
I have (said Mr H ) in my possession the peti-
tion of John Ritchie, one of these men, now up-
wards of 64 yeais old, who, from the age of 16,
was constantly engaged in the service of his coun-
try, he went tnroughout his whole campaign with
Colonel Logan, he fought n and was one of the
few who fortunately escaped from the disastrous
action at the junction of the St Mary's and St
Josenh's, generally known as the defeat of Gen
eral Harmar, he was w th the five hundred picked
men who performed one of the boldest torrs on
íecoid against the Indians under the command of
General Chailes Scott, that chivalnc hero of al
most a hundred fields, with whose name nistory at
¡east associates no ideas of íobbmg and plunder
Ihis same individual was atterwaulswith thefiist
force that ever penetrated to the Upper Wabash
under General Wilkinson, and was ¡ resent at the
destruction of the Wea towns, and, sir, hefina'ly
followed the steps of Anthony Wayne throughout
the whole of his memorable and glorious cam-
! 1121, concluded by the treaty of Gienville in
1795 Years afterwards, when the Goveirment
¿.jam required the services of her citizens in the
fi«ld, this man, although advanced in ¡>fe, was
amongst the first of the gallant and patriotic Ktn-
tuckians who so freely flocked to her standard, he
was at the siege of Fort Meigs, and, if my recol-
lection of the events of his life serve me right,
although it is not stated in his petition, an honor-
able and highly distinguished gentleman on this
floor from Kentucky, [Colonel Richard M John-
son,] one distinguished alike by his- preeminent
civil and military services on every occasion, so
cheerfully and efficiently rendered his country*
can bear individual testimony to the gallant con-
duct of my old friend in that field, where, by the
defeat and death of the most justly celebrated man
of all their warriors, the Indian power in the West
was finally and forever broken, I allude to the
battle of the Thames.
In declining age he now finds himself a prey to
poverty, a constitution broken, and health enfee-
bled by early hardships, disable him from ordinary
agricultural labor Sir, should such a man, as
life wanes lower and lower in the socket, be left I
alone to the " cold charity of the world'" His
youth and manhood—that vigorous portion of I
existence which in these times men devote to
hoarding up for age—Were by him passed in tne
constant and arduous service of his country
It may be said that this is but a single instance,
and that the provisions of the resolution are gen
eral Sir, this brief sketch would represent the
claims of a majority of those benefited by the ulti-
mate success of the principle contained in the reso-
lution The instance I have given is far from
being solitary.    It is in reality the history of a
i peculiar body of men, whose services cannot be
obliterated by time, who, regardless of personal
peril, seeking no individual advantage, dared every-
thing in a most hazardous cause Mi Speaker,
did they effect nothing' They fought amid a wil-
derness, boundless in extent, they fought for a
wilderness, they succeeded, the result is known
to all The wilderness is now peopled by more
than five millions of ra'ional and intelligent beings,
as happy, as free, as geneious, and as brave as the
sun ever shown down upon The eye is every-
where greeted with smiling and beautiful farms,
with flourishing villages, in the midst cities have
risen, and, overall, law and order, the lights of
revealed religion and the blessings of civil liberty
prevail.
Sir, it is for the surviving patriarch whose toils
have brought so rich a harvest to others, that some
little memento of national gratitude is now asked
It is not sought for robbers and plunderers The
gentleman fiom Rhode Island knows them  not,
| from nothing on eaith could they be more remote
I Wanton aggression and unlicensed pillage stain
not the history of their lives Their devotional
love of liberty was united to a singleness of heart
and a simplicity of manner that might vie with the
shepherd of old " watching his flocks on Chaldea's
hills "
Mr  H  said that before concluding he wished
to bestow a few observations on the amendment I
offered by the honorable gentleman from Virginia, I
[Mr  Bouldis,] proposing to abolish all pension I
laws     Througnout the entne discussion of the j
i question this amendment, in reality the legitimate
j suoject of debate, had been totally overlooked, [
until the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr '
Pif cknet] had raised it fiom the condition of deep
apa'hy, to which common consent had apparently
consigned it To that honorable gentleman [Mr
Pivckvey] it was indebted for at least the active
portion of its existence Poi at the moment of its
fiist appearance " in this breathing world," it had
seemingly fa'len stillborn into the hands of the
Clerk, without, so far as be (Mr H ) recollected,
even a show of fatherly fondness from thehonor-
1 abie mover for his unfortunate and ill conceived
bantling      Notwithstanding this neglect of the
I natural protector, however, the imp has been so
far resusc tated as to chirp in the fostering arms
| of its late fond nurse
1     The policy or the justice of that amendment are
■ alike beyond my comprehension Even a well-
founded reason for Us adoption is more than I
can imagine, nosuggestionsofnecessaryeconomy
can be biought in aid of the proposition No
national deot hangs ovei us, no national pecuniary
embarrassment of any nature or character whatso-
ever     Is the Government, then, so poor that she
I cannot pay this slight acknowledgment of grati-
1 tude for i,erv ces tendered m a cause that has been
sanctified beyond all others, by its result upon the
happiness and the liberties of mankind > We have
thousands to give annually for the improvement
and repairs of Pennsylvania avenue, we have thou-
sands to give for trimming the bushes, and turning
the walks around this building, thousands to make
" Goose Creek once, the Tiber now," flow in a
direction something different from what nature
intended it, thousands to give for innumerable
other purposes of about equal importance to the
country, but not one cent to those who fought to
make that country fiee
What, sir, strike out the pension act' When
you do so, when you efface it fiom the statute-
book, blot out at tne same time from the history
of your country the name of every consecrated
field on which these veterans fought, whether of
victory or disaster Do it, sir1 erase the one, but
leave no vestige of the other Let not posterity
be left to blush, that we sedulously preserved the
record of those glorious fields, but consigned to
poverty and misery the individuals who had ren-
dered them immortal Shall we tell the gallant
mariner who has borne our flag in triumph over
every sea, that hereafter, when worn down and
unfit for service, he will be cast aside unnoticed__
unregarded, the country he has so fondly loved, so
proudly defended, with millions in her Treasury,
will leave him, the neglected victim of age, disease,
and poverty combined'
For myself, I cannot concur in such sentiments;
patriotism alone forbids the thought, and it is to
be hoped that the justice and the generosity of this
House will forever preclude it. My vote shall
never deny to him who aided either in establish-
ing or defending the Union and the liberties of this
Republic, a just reward, sufficient to render easy
his declining years.
He had no fear, however, that the amendment
of the gentleman from Virginia would prevail,
and sincerely hoped that a law would be passed
pursuant to the principle proposed by the resolu-
tion.

The VICE PRESIDENT communicated a let-
ter from the Governor of Michigan relative to the
improvement of the navigation of certain rivers in
that Territory
Mr SHEPLEY presented the resolutions of a
large number of the citizens of Portland adverse
to a change of the mode of collecting the revenue
fiom credit to cash, and also disapproving of the
course of the Secretary of the Treasury in re-
moving the deposites, which was read, referred
to the Committee on Finance, and ordered to be
printed
On presenting these resolutions, Mr SHEP-
LEY ob&erved, that the signers were known to
him to be gentlemen of great respectability, al-
though differing from him m opinion in relation
to many matters contained in those resolutions
It may not be improper to remark, that they do
not assume to represent the opinion of the city of
Portland, but only of a large number of its citi-
zens
The resolu'ions were read, ard referred to the
Committee on Finance, and ordered to be print-
ed
Mr SHEPLEY lose and said.
Mr President, I ask leave to present certain
resolutions of the Legislature of the State of Maine,
expressing the opinion of that Legislature in re-
lation to the Bank of the United States, to the
cause of the distress upon the commercial com-
munity, and to the removal of the public deposites,
and instructing her Senators to oppose a restora-
tion of the deposites and a renewal of the charter
of the bank
On presenting these resolutions, I ask the in-
dulgence of the Senate for a few moments, to state
that the State of Maine, presenting a sea coast of
more than three hundred miles in extent, and
rivers of no inconsiderable magnitude extending
fiom the sea shoiefar into the interior of the State,
and there connecting themselves with large inland
bodies of water, and a very large tract of land,
I! covered with forest timber trees, portions of which
j are annually felled, floated on these waters, and
manufactured into building materials, and trans-
