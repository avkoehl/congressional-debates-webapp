SIR: Herewith inclosed I have the honor to transmit, for the information of the major-general commanding department, a copy of extract of Special Orders, Numbers 99, War Department, Adjutant-General's Office, Washington, March 2, 1863.

In consequence of the letter and spirit of said orders, I have not reported to other authority than the War Department. I am still here, however, waiting further orders, and would be most happy to be placed on duty in accordance with my rank.

When Adjt. General L. Thomas was recently here he thought it probable Major-General Hurlbut might assign me to the command of this post, its present commandant being transferred elsewhere. Should be gratified to have the command if allowed to report directly to the major-general commanding the department. Would respectfully inquire if there was any such intentions; and, if so, is it still entertained or abandoned; and, if the latter, cannot it be put into execution elsewhere? I am anxious to do duty.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. R. MONTGOMERY,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
