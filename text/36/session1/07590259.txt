APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

36th Cong....1st Sess.
Territorial Policy of the Government—Mr. Eliot.
Ho. of Reps.
Their men and women desire no contact with the
slave or with the labor of the slave. To dishonor
labor is to degrade them. This thing must not be
done; and it cannot be done unless faithless coun-
cils and timid men shall make another compro-
mise and secure for the interests of freedom an-
other defeat.
Sir, the free States own the land within the
Territories in common with the South. But if
free labor is driven out, the value of their lands is
greatly reduced; the standard of education falls;
the material interests of the people decline, and
their moral condition is lowered.
The honorable gentleman from Georgia [Mr.
Love] said the other day, as I find his argument
reported:
u But I propose to test this morlil question by another
rule. I hold it to be tiue that the best rule by which to
judge of the moral condition of any people, is the facilities
which that people have for leligious instiuction. Now,
sir, 1 suppose that the correctness of this rule will not be
disputed ; for it is the rule upon which is founded every
effort to evangelize the world."
Well, sir, let us apply that rule for a single
moment. I wish that I had time to do so thor-
oughly. In one small county in Massachusetts—
Hampshire county—where the total population,
as given by Mr. DeBow, was, in 1850, less than
thirty-six thousand, white and colored, it appears
from a report recently published by the American
Board of Commissioners of the Foreign Mission
Society, th^t the contributions to the American
Board from that one county during the past year
were $6,219 40.
During the same time, from fourteen slave
States, including the District of Columbia, the
contnbutions to the same board are stated to be
$8,121 G3; that is to say, the single county con-
tributed to that cause within $1,903 as much as all
those States ! Facilities for instruction are best
determined by results produced.
In a volume which I find in our congressional
library, purporting to be written by the Rev.
Mr. Tower,,the author inserts an extract from a
report drawn up by a southern ecclesiastical body.
Here is that testimony: x
u The influence of the negroes upon the moral and reli-
gious interests of the whites is destructive in the extreme.
We cannot go into special detail. It is unnecessary. We
make oui appeal to universal experience. We are chained
to a putrid caicass ! It sickens and destroys us. Wehave
a uullstone hanging about the neck of our society, to sink
us deep in the t-ea of vice. Our children are corrupting
from their infancy, nor can we prevent it. Many an anxious
parent, like the nus-'ionaiics in foreign lands, wishes his
children could be brought beyond the leach of the coirupt-
ing influence of the depraved heathen. Nor is this influ-
ence confined to moie childhood. If that wcieall. it would
be tieinendous. But it follow? Into jouth, into manhood,
and into old a<fc. And when wc come directly into contact
with their dept avity in the management of them, then come
temptations?, and piovocation*, and trials that unsearchable
grace only can enable us to endure. In all our intercourse
with them, we are undergoing a process of intellectual and
moral deterioiauon; and it requires almost superhuman
efforts to maintain a high standing either for intelligence
oi piety.''
' I offer now, as bearing upon the moral and po-
litical aspect of this question of slavery exten-
sion, the following statistical proofs. But first,
let mc refer to the language used by the gentle-
man from Georgia, [Mr. Love:]
"As to the other point, whether slavery is a political
evil, T hold it to be legitimately discussable. Not that Con-
gress has any power over it, but because, as yet, we are
citizens of a common country, and should consulttogether
m a pioper temper and spirit as to what i<< best for us as a
nation. If, upon a full investigation of the facts, we of the
South should become satisfied that slavery is a gieat polit-
ical evil, it would be our duty, as patriots and good citi-
zens, to get clear of it as toou a* possible. What i* a polit-
ical evil? I have given this subject some lcllection, sn ;
and the best definition which I can fix m my mind is, that
apolitical evil is something which, from its very natuie,
mubt impair our national reputation abroad, or diminish our
mateual strength at home." ' 4
That is a fair and manly statement; and I am
content with the definition of what is a "political
evil," and earnestly commend the fullest investi-
gation of the facts.
Here is a statement taken from DeBow's Cen-
sus, by Mr. Tower. ' It concerns Pennsylvania
and Virginia. What cause has operated to ele-
vate the one, and to depress the material strength
of the other ? If slavery has thus affected a Com-
monwealth like Virginia, which was the " Old Do-
minion," where God has lavished with unsparing
hand His richest gifts of climate and of soil and
of inland stream, has not the North something to
say when the master would lead his slave into our
common lands?
Viiginia contains   61,303 square miles.
Pennsylvania contains 46,000 " "
Both, at first, were slave States.
Virginia has a shore line of six hundred and fifty-four
miles. Pennsylvania has ocean access thiough a river and
bay channel,

What has produced this result?
There are in Pennsylvania 8,623,619 acres of improved
land. In Vnginia there are 10,360,135 acres.
The average yield per acre in Virginia is not one half
that of Pennsylvania.
The average wheat crop in Pennsylvania is 15 bushels
per acrc; and in Virginia 7 bushels.
The average corn crop in Pennsylvania is 20 bushels ;
anclin Virginia 18 bushels.
The average rye crop in Pennsylvania is 14 bushels; and
in Virginia 5 bushels.
The leiative value of land is what must be expected
from these facts.
The value of the improved lands in Pennsylvania is
$407,876,099; and in Virginia, $216,401,543.
The ten million acres in Virginia are worth little more
than half the eight million in Pennsylvania.
Pi ivate property owned in Penneylvaniais $729,144,390:
and in Vnginia, $391,646,430.
I now offer some facts respecting sixteen free
States, containing an area of six hundred and
twelve thousand six hundred square miles, and
fifteen slave States, containing an area of eight
hundred and fifty-one thousand four hundred and
fifty square miles.
These facts are collected, in part, from Mr. De-
Bow 's census, and in part from Mr. Helper's book,
which certainly contains much statistical informa-
tion illustrating the question we are discussing:

But, Mr. Chairman, if free labor is driven out
from the Territories, and slave labor occupies ita
place, slave laws must be enacted to protect that
labor and its owner.
In that fact the North is deeply interested. Tin
free colored citizens of northern States cannot
travel in southern States without danger of im-
prisonment and sale. I know not whether this is
true in all the slave States; but I believe it to be so-
I have had occasion, quite recently, to know
something of the laws of Maryland in this respect.
A free colored citizen of Massachusetts was im-
prisoned there lor traveling th rough the State with-
out the proofs of his freedom upon his person. He-
was at the mercy of the law. After an imprison-
ment of two months, upon payment by Jiis friendti
of the costs of his imprisonment into the treas-
ury of Maryland, ho was released. While in jail,
some friend induced the Uritish consul to inter-
fere for him under the belief that the man himself
was a subject of Great Britain. But the man, not
knowing that the paw of the British lion was a
sure defense, while the talon of the American eagle
closed upon the victim, asserted his true citizen-
ship, and remained in prison until the laws were
vindicated and the prison door was opened.
This may be nccessary; it may be right; the
North cannot prevent it. Bat surely it is not hard
to see what the North has to do with slavery. Why,
sir, we have everything to do with it, if the doc
trines of Mr. Buchanan and tho southern Democ •
racy are to be enforced. And because their doc-
trines arc claimed to be true; because it is the
purpose of that party, which now holds the power
of this Government, to enforce those doctrines, if
they arc permitted to retain that power, this Re-
publican party is here now in Congress, and be-
fore the people, to declare what are the constitu-
tional rights of freedom, and what must be the
constitutional restraints of slavery.
Mr. Chairman, the Republican party, from thr .
ncccssiiics of the cose, must succeed, if it be not
faithless to itself. The southern Democracy will
not be content until they have driven to the wri-
the entire conservative element upon which they
have heretofore relied at the North. Every step
they take, every auo&ant deumnd they make,
every new claim of rigfit they institute and con-
tend for, drives from their support an army of
men at the North, and disconcerts and embarrass-
es at the South more than venture at the present
time to express their opinions openly. Why,sir,
if every slave could be put afar olf, so that no dis-
cussion could reach his ear, and free discussion
could be had, let us come among you, and stand
upon your hill-sides, as you may stand on Ply-
mouth rock, to announce and to discuss and to
demonstrate political truths, and it would not be
a twelvemonth before, in nearly every southc m
State, our Republican party would find goore sup-
porters than the Democracy of 1BG0 will find m
its most favored northern State.
Mr. Chairman, it has been declared here, by
some of the ablest speakers from the South, that
the success of our party—which seeks to do noth-
