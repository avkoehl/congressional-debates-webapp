SATURDAY, DECEMBER 6, 1856.
New Series...,.No. 1.
This is the first number of the Congressional Globe
for this session—the third of tbe Thirty-Fourth Congress.
The work will be stereotyped, and therefore those who
may subscribe hereafter, during this secern, will get all the
numbers; butafterthis session has ended, the price wjSI
be increased to such a sum as will pay for reprinting from
the plates.
The Congressional Globe and Appendix and Laws
will not be sold separately, as they were a few years ago.
When separated they did not give erenerai satisfaction^ a
subscriber for one would frequently want the other when
too late to furnish him with the back numbers. Therefore
the Congressional Globe and the Appesdix and the
Laws w H all be sold together. A man who may think, he
has not the money to spare to purchase the whole, may get
a club to join him".
The price for the whole for this session is $3. They all
go free by maik
