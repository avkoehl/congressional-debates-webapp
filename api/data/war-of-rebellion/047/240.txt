I would respectfully recommend and request that these parties be at once employed to prepare such projectiles as are most needed, and for which the necessity is pressing, viz, 8 and 10-inch shot and shell, projectiles for rifled 32, 42, and 24 pounders. Any aid that can be given these gentlemen in the way of transportation and material, if not inconsistent with the interest of the public service, will be sanctioned by the general commanding this department.

I hope, major, this matter will receive your earliest consideration, as I fear the amount of ammunition I shall be able to obtain from your arsenal and other points throughout the Confederacy will be inadequate to the present pressing wants of the service at this point.

I would also inform you that I am now much in want of ammunition for the 7-inch and 6.40 Brooke; also 4 and 3 1/2 inch Blakely guns, as well as the 4.62 rifled guns. Please answer.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WADDY,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Chief of Ordnance.
