Hampshire, and the rights of the c<> zens upon
that lemtory, from this foreign interference and
lawless aggression An 1 smee the State found it
necessary to cpII out it  own military force for the
purpose, the Federal Government was not the less
bound to defray the expense He then referred
particularly to an eia! orate report upon the subject,
made to the Hou3e of Representatives in 1839 by
Mr. Howard, Cbauman ot the Committee on Fo-
reign Affa rs
Mr CRITTENDEN wa  not satisfied yet that
there had been any invasion 11 ihe c untry. There
had only been some lit le con'iotersy with ties
passers who were presuming to act undei d fier-
ent authority, and the StPte of New Hampshire
had done nothing more than hei duty n putting
an end to the trespa^, but she m ght hav don it
by civil process, and it was the duty of the mil it try
power to aid the civil powei m the service oi such
process.
Mr. HUBBARD said, as he understood the Sena-
tor from Kentucky, that gentleman said tr-ere hatl
been no invasion of the territory Now, since the
treaty of peace, the terr'to^y in quest on had always
been occupied as part of the tern ory of New
Hampshire, in fact, since 1790, Hall's s'ream ua>
considered the northwestern brancn of the Connie
ticutrivei, and that itream wis distinctly marked
as the boundary line between t! e provinces of
Canada and New Haripshup But, a ter the King
of the Netherlands made his award, the Bnti h au-
thorities in Canada undertook to exercise authonty
between that bouruary sircan1 and Ind an stream,
and it was to expel these mtiudtrs that tli« Gover-
nor of New Hampshire h>d found it necessary
to call out the militia atan expense of jjG 000
Thii was necessaiy to the exercise of jurisdiction
both by the State and the United S ates Tee
State of New Hampshire was interrupted in her
peaceable oecupancv oí that tern ory, an! it be-
came necessary, to maintain then jetrisdiet on that
the steps should be taken wine i wre re uled lo
There was, he beH ed, no actual h s of hvs in
tie defence o'" ibis t< rritoiy, or ot their jurr-diciion
over it, but that would not change the merits of trie
question
Mr CRITTENDEN did no* d s, ute Ihe n l.t of
New Hampshire to this tei i ory, but t^ere had
been no invasion—diere had been notlut g more
than a rest tance to toe service of ejal nroc  s, ind
not by citiz ns of Canada alone, but of New Hxrnp-
shire herself, for ther^ wss but one Canadian «ho
presumed to act as a Canadian offi>er—a Canada
jus'ice of the p ice, who presumed *o isste his war-
rant for execution on tl e tern'ory Did th it, then,
justify the ca'lmg out "f the militia, ¿nd the mak
ing the Genera! Government inswerab e for mi e v
pense? He was glad t1 e amount was but smal1, it
was the principle oidy wmch he here wishd o L
settled, his anxiety was to vindicate Am -
lican rights and the TíHIs o tur te-rito
nes, but it did s tm e> him that th-re muss
be some limit fixed to lie e othe wise un jo-rdtd
rights of the Stat s a d th" Ternton s Hue
there was not a man wi h arms ir hi lands, o far
as he understood tne ola'cment ot the honorable
Senators—there was n"th ig more 'hen what
amounted, technieaM, to a m r tre piss by an
individual who Tight ha e been more eh^aily
punished by the civil po   er

done? Here was a large tract of their lemtory,
and how were they to get possession of it, if an
order had been given to march a King's regiment
into it? Whv, they shou'd have called out their
militia to expel the invaders, and they wruld e'ear-
ly have been entitled to eime to the General Go-
