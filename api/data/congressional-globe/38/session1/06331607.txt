of the masses, in mechanical j 1 i, in tigrieultin.il
industry, and the day is not far distant wh^n that
bright and beautiful banner, the emblcmof west-

folds one hundred stars, representing that number
of independent States stretching acioss (he conti-

the proud motto, tiEpluribus tmtm,"and resting
secure within the American Union, giving to all
that consciousness of strength which will ever
enable us to strangle treason at home and to repel
invasion from abroad, and reassuring the world
that at last the United States of America is

Mr. ROGERS obtained the floor, butyielded to
Mr. HOLMAN, who moved that the House
adjourn.
Mr. COLFAX. I wish to give notice, as the
debate on this question has gone to an extent that
every gentleman must agree has been liberal, and
as, in the last vote in the House, when the gen-
tleman from Ohio, Mr. Giddings, was censured
and virtually expelled, he was notallowedan op-
portunity to speak, I will, as soon on Thursday
as I get the floor, call the previous question.
The motion to adjourn was agreed to.
And then (at half past eleven o'clock, p. m.)
the House adjourned.

â€¢ ADMISSION OF NEBRASKA AS A STATE.
Mr. WADE. I move now to take up the bill
to enable the people of Nebraska to form a State
govern ment.
Mr. DAVIS. I object. I desire to have a vote
upon the resolution introduced by me some time
aico in relation to the case of Yocum; and if the
Senate will come to a vote upon that resolution I
think itcan be done withoutdebate. ] shall have
no objection to any course that the honorable
Senator or anybody else may propose.
Mr. WADE. 1 suppose the bill will not take
long; we had it up the other day and discussed it.
I do not think there will be any further debate
upon it. My opinion is that the Senate is ready
now to pass the bill without discussion,and if the
Senate will let me get it up I think it will soon
be got out of the way. If the people of Nebraska-
are to be authorized to form a State government
the authority ought to be given soon, in order to
enable them to do it in season.
Mr. DAVIS. 1 dislike exceedingly to interfere
with the request of the honorable Senator; but I
move to take up the resolution to refer the case of
Yocum to the Committee on the Judiciary merely
for a vote, and when that is disposed of by a vote,
without another word of debate I promise the
honorable Senator and all other gentlemen that I
will not interfere with them.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion of the
Senator from Ohio is first in order unless he with-
draws it.
Mr. WADE. I do not think I ought to with*
diuw 11, because I feel certain the bill will take
very little time.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question is on
the motion of the Senator from Ohio-
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate re-
sumed the consideration of the bill (H. R. No.
14|) to enable the people of Nebraska to form a
constitution and State government, and for the
admission of such State into the Union on an equal
footing with the original States.
The bill was ordered to a third reading, was
read the third time, and passed,
PAPERS WITHDRAWN AND. REFERRED.
