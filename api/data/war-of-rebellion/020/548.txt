tainly a disadvantage, but should not be regarded an insuperable objection. I am informed of a position some ten miles above Chattahoochee, known as Rock Island. I have not seen the locality. Unless it has very greatly superior advantage in other respects it is higher up than I should like. Wherever the site selected may be it will become necessary to apply to the War Department to withdraw the guns from Ricco's Bluff, unless Fort Gadsden be chosen, to any point below Chattahoochee lying within the Department of Eastern and Middle Florida, over which I have no control. Should Fort Gadsden be selected, General Finegan, commanding the department, is competent to make the change. I leave the choice of the localities to Colonel Boggs, whom I understand Your Excellency to place under my orders for the proposed object, and I will thank you to instruct him in my name to proceed at once to make the necessary reconnaissance, reporting to me the result. For this end he is authorized to employ such transportation and assistance as he may deem necessary. If my other duties will permit I shall endeavor to visit the river myself in a few days.

Very respectfully,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel C. K. HUGER, Fort Pemberton, S. C.:

I wish the suggestion of placing a sunken battery for eight siege howitzers in the woods below the fort carried out at once. So soon as the battery is constructed the guns can be placed there. Captain Ramsay will at once procure a sufficient number of sand bags to make merlons as described by Mr. A. J. Gonzales, and so locate them.

Very respectfully,J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 5, 1862.
