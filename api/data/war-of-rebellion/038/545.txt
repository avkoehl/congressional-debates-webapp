POST-OFFICE DEPARTMENT, INSPECTION OFFICE,

Washington, July 22, 1863.

A. H. MARKLAND,

Special Agent, Post-Office Department, Vicksburg, MISS.:

SIR: Your telegram of the 4th instant and your letter of the 6th instant were duly received. Your promptness in taking charge and opening the post-office at Vicksburg, immediately upon the occupation of that place by our troops, merits and receives the commendation of the Department. You will please remain in charge of the post-office until the return of Mr. Johnston, who you are correctly informed has been designated as the special agent for that office. Your suggestion that it will be safe to order the New Orleans mails via the Mississippi River has been referred to the central office, where it will receive due consideration.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. K. SCOTT,

Acting Chief Clerk.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF THE TENN., Vicksburg, MISS., July 23, 1863.

Major-General HERRON, Commanding DIVISION:

GENERAL: You will proceed as early as practicable with your DIVISION to Port Hudson, La., and there report in person by telegraph to Major-General Banks, commanding Department of the Gulf. You will take with you all the baggage and transportation of your DIVISION, thirty days' rations, and 500 rounds per man of infantry ammunition, and artillery ammunition to refill boxes once. Should no orders reach you before arriving at Port Hudson, you will go on to that point and await orders there.

Should General Banks give you service to perform in co-operation with movements in other part of his department, and which require a greater force than you have with you, call upon me, and I will endeavor to re-enforce you to the necessary extent. All the troops left with me are exhausted and unfit for immediate service. It is hoped, therefore, that no call will be made for more troops, except in case of great necessity.

Very respectfully,U. S. GRANT.
