the committee has not power to entertain any
such motion to extend the debate, as that can
only be done in the House.
Mr. DAWES. I wish to say a word.
Mr. SPEER, of Georgia. I movethecom-
mittee rise.
Mr. DAWES. In a moment. I have not
pressed for the floor for the purpose of pre-
venting the committee having charge of this
bill from being heard. I do not know that I
have anything to say which is worth occupy-
ing the attention of members. I wanted the
floor, however, to say a few words, and 1
thought the gentleman from Mississippi [Mr.
Perce] was not quite generous to me. I
recognize the right of the committee to close
the debate. It is for them to say when it
shall be closed. But if it is the desire of the
committee that I shall speak for half an hour,
I am willing to do so at any time when it will
best suit the convenience of the House.
Mr. SPEER, of Georgia. I move that the
committee do now rise.
Mr. DAWES. If it is the desire of the
committee to rise, I have no wish to speak at
present, and I yield to the gentleman from
Georgia to take the sense of the committee on
that question.
The motion that the committee rise was
agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose; and Mr.
ScoriELD having taken the chair as Speaker
pro tempore, Mr. L. Myers reported that,
pursuant to the order of the House, the Com-
mittee of the Whole had had under considera-
tion the Private Calendar, and had come to no
resolution thereon.
Mr. GAIiFIELD, of Ohio. I move that
the House now adjourn.
Pending the motion to adjourn,
SESSION OF TO-MORROW.
The SPEAKER pro tempore. By order of
the House, the session of to-morrow will be
for general debate only, in the House as in
Committee of the Whole, no business what-
ever to be transacted. The gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Upson] will occupy the chair as
Speaker pro tempore.
The question recurred upon the motion of
Mr. Garfield, of Ohio, that the House adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and accordingly

the world by our forefathers, who said:
"We, the people of the United States, in order to
form a more perfect Union, establish justioe, insure
