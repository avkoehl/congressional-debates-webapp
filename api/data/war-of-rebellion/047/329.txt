The advance of the enemy into Tennessee and his raids into Virginia have cut off, to a very large extent, our supply of niter and metal, and, as this supply may be still further reduced and our resources soon exhausted, it is ot the greatest importance to economize ammunition as much as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., September 1, 1863.

Major General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

Can you spare me, say, 500 small-arms-to be returned in twenty days?

CHARLESTON, S. C., September 1, 1863.

Major General W. H. C. WHITTING, Wilmington, N. C.:

Can you no hurry up that second Blakely gun? Its position on White Point Battery will soon be ready. It is believed iron-clads will try to run the gauntlet of outer batteries. Sumter and Wagner still gallantly held.

D. B. HARRIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief Engineer:

COLONEL: The commanding general wishes you to send 100 negroes, with competent managers, to Morris Island as soon as practicable (if not already done), to relieve those sent there this morning.

Enlarge the necessary embrasures in Fort Sumter to take our three 42-pounder rifled guns, now unserviceable in that work.

The general also desirers that the parapets of Battery Haskell should be strengthened, and that you will erect bomb-proofs there as soon as practicable.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

JOHN S. McDANIEL. Kingstree, S. C.:

SIR: I regret that you have found planters so ready with excuses for not furnishing labor to defend Charleston. May God grant that, in seeking to avoid furnishing a fourth of their labor, at this momentous juncture, they do not materially contribute to the loss of the whole.
