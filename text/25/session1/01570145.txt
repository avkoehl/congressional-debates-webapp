Vtn-tnvrE 5.........No. 10.
BY BLAIR & RIVES.
-WEEKLY-
PRICE $&, FIRST TWO SESSIONS.
[ Continued from No  9 ]
and instantly on its adoption the chairman of the
Committee of Wa)S and Means spring *o his feet
and demanded thepievious question, and the bill
was thus passed almost by acclamation,
N iw the bill came batir from the Seinte with an
amendment, which would render the whole either a
palpable absurdity or else an instrument of fraud
And ibis was the waj in which Ihe business of this
whole bestión had been conducted, a session which
had been called for the purpose of organizing an
entirely new system of finance foi the country
The House hid «¡auctioned a series of measures all
tending to this object, but ihe most pernicious and
cruel ol them al1 had, he thanked God, been laid
upon the tibie At least a respite had thus been
iffbided to die nation, a breathing spell, before it
had imposed upon it that state of servitude wh ch
the ystem, if successful, would not have failed tc
fasten upon it He now said, openly, in the face
of the House, that whenever objections, however
strong h id been urged against the system of mea-
sures which hai originated m the Treasurv, with
the exception of a few petty piltry amendments
proposed by the chmimn of the Finance Commit-
tee, that gentleman had no other lecourse against
them but to call upon his piriy to "toe the
mark," that had been hi* answer, and his
Mhole answer, to every argument Tint had
been the histoiv of the session Tie olmiman
t f the Committee of Ways and Means, the
m ntstei- of the Executive, the Chancellor of the
Evcneqner who was here to cany into effect the
receipts of the Treasury Depar ment, had no other
an^wei to any objections, either in gross or in de-
tail, than this cry of " toe the mark " Mr A had
asked of him what part of this bill applied to de-
1 nquent banks? What it was that by the bill the
United States gav e up7 And he had been utterly
imab'e to answ er, yet, from his official situation, it
w as his p ace to answer inquiries put to him m re-
lat on to the public measures he brought forward
His only reply had been to get the bill laid aside,
f> consummate his bargain, and then to call the
previous question Such had been his course
thioUjjhout, and Mr. A could not suffer the session
to come to a close, w ithout exposing and denounc-
ing it to the country Had the sj stem originated
¡n Heaven, (which seemed to be ihe very contrary
p'aee to that in which it did originate,) auestions,
of a relevant nature, pnd properly piesented, might
be asked of him who brought it into the House,
and it wis his official duty o respond to them, and
to give his rpasons if an} he had But nothing of
this had been done at all He had got the deposite
pos'pone nent bill pis ed, after attempting to force
it tnrough the House m its onginal form, by admit-
ting the minimum amendments, and excludn g
eveiy o her
The CHAIR heie admoRished Mr A that the
deposite bill could not now be discussed, it was not
fie'ore the House
Mr A I consider eich and all of these bills as
pirt and parcel of one sj stem, and therefore—
TheSPF\KER This is a question ol concui-
rence with the amendment t f the Seinte to a dif-
ieren! bil1, it has no connection with the deposite
law, and l' is out of older to uscissthat la  at
this time
Mi A Does the Spell ei deny that these mev
s ires const! ute one system' Does he decide that
this bill and amen 1 ment -ire not pari of mat svs-
tem'
The SPEAKER The Chin is not ca'led to
decidetbit question Th >. is not 'ht deposite bill,
and the depisitebill can not now be discussed
Mi A I wis not discussing the deposite bill I
was connecting the other measuie with that n< w
he ft re the House I was showing its connection w h
lhis 1 ill and amendment They are so connected
that they can not be separated, and I wasderrvmg
n argument agimst concurring in this, amendn ent
from external objects, and the and deposite law
amoug others
The SPEAKER here said that if it was the ob-
ject ef the gentleman to connect it with the present
stfbject, and there could be shown to exist such a
connection, it would be in order to introduce ,t, but
the Chair could percen e no connect on He would
leave it to the judgment of the gentleman from
Massachusetts
Mr CAMBRELENG said he did not hear the
decision of the Chair, if the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts was >ut of order, he hoped he would not
be permitted to proceed
Mr A. Well since whatl was «ajirrg íssoex-
ceedmglv disagreeable to the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, and apparently to the
Sfeam.r of this House, I will sit down
The SPEAKER It is not disagreeable to the
SptiKFn he has no desire to interrupt the gentle-
man from Massachusetts but the Chair must dis-
chirbi. it* official dutj ,
Mi A I have no doubt of the deposition ot the
Speakfr to discharge his duty "as he understands
it " but, unfoitunalely for me, the Spuhis under-
stands it a different way from what I do
Mr C4MBRELENGrose to order When a
member was called to order by the Chvir, and was
manifes ly out of order, and was ordeifd to take
his seat, was it not his duty, under the rules of the
House, to take his seat' and could he again proceed
without the leave of the House?
The SPEAKER said thit «hen a member was
so repeatedly out of orier as to be directed b} the
Chvir to tike his seat, the rule was as the gentle-
man from New York had staled But, in the case
of the gentleman from Massachusetts, the Chair
had abstained from intei posing by an absolute
command, as he was empowered by the rules 10 do
and the gentleman was therefore at liberty to pro-
ceed, if he confined himself to the subject before
the House
Mr A Out of tenderness to the Chairman oí
the Committee of Ways and Means, I will say no
more
Mr CAMBRELEFG All I sha'l say in reply
is, that as the gentleman has referred, in his sup-
positious case, to a council in the moon, I should
consider the gentleman himself as verj fit to be a
mcmbei of such a council
I demiod the previous ques ion
Ml LINCOLN here moved to lay the lull and
amendment on ti e table, and as, br the rules, this
auestion takes precedence, the questun was put
upon haying on the table
Mr RICr G'vRLAND hoped the mo ion would
be withdrawn that he might hav c an rpportumty
of replying to the very unju tifiable attack made
bv the gentleman from Massachusetts upon the
members from Louisiana
Mr LINCOLN declined, and ?<xe<\ for the jeas
an I na\s but they vveie refuseo, an I die question
uas thereupon put to the House, and decided in the
negative w ilhout a couct
The call foi the previous question w as seconded

Tnemain question, on concnriing with the Se-
nile m then amendment to me bill (as abovp

[This decision completed the passage of Ihe bill
through both Hou>es ]
Mr CAMBRELEFG then rose and drew the
attention of ihe House to a very valuable work that
had b*en published, con'aining ail the Treasury
reports on the subject of the finances, from the
year 1789 to the present time, and remarked, that
it would not onlv be vr-ry useful to be deposited in
the library, but, as a statistical work, was abso-
lutely indispensab'e as a book of reference He,
therefore, asked leave to submit a resolution foi
the purchase of three hundred copies of the said
work, at a puce not exceeding the usual rates paid
for congressional documents ordeied by the House
The resolution bavin  been received—
Mr WHITTLESEY of Oh o objected to it as
incurring an expense without due consideration
A proposit on of this kind ought to undergo the
rev ision eithei of the Committee of Accounts or
the Committee on the Libran.
Mr CAMBRELENG replied that it had met
the approbation of the chairman of the Committee
od the Librarj (\li Patton,) who would have sub-
mitted the resdulion, if he had been m the Honse,
and had also been approved of bj pnother mem-
ber of that comm ttee then present (Mi Lincoln,)
and likewise by the absent member (Mr Crary )
Mr WHITTLESEY wished to see the work
first btfc íe he w auld consent to its purchase
Mr C4MBRELENG replied, that it was the
only work he had seen confined exclusively to the
Treasury reports In fact, none of them had ever
been published
Mr LINCOLN expressed his readiness to vote
for the purchase of this work
Mr HARLA.N moved to lay the resolution on
the table, which was agreed lo
Mr ROBERTSON submitted a plan for the re-
ceipt, custody, and disbursement ot the public mo-
neys, wh ch he proposes hereafter to submit, and
on hi^ notion it was ordered to be printed
[This is the same heretofore submitted bj Mr R
and printed in the Globe ]
Mr WILLI 4MS, of Noith Carolina, asked
leave to introduce the following- resolution
Resolved, Teat the Clerk of the House be m-
stiuciid, with the aid of the Commissioner oí Pub-
lic Bui'dmgs, to cause the chair of the Speaker,
and the sea's of the memuers, to be restored to their
fi rmei position in the hail
Several memoers objected to the introduction of
the resolution, when
Mi MERCER moved to suspend the rules so as
to introduce the same
The motion was disagreed to, two-thirds not
rising m its favoi
The resolut on which had been received from
the Senate a (ew minutes  before, for the appoint
ment 01 a jvint committee to wait on the Presiden-
of the United Sta es, and inform him that, unless
he had other communications to make to Congress,
•he two Houses vveie about to close the present
session bv an adjournment, was now taken up and
asirned to and
Mr Tm m., of Man lfnd, Mr Pope, of Ken-
tnckv, and Mi Tcvlor of New York, were
pppointrd t f hf committee on the part ot tha
Hoi se
Mr LEWIS, of i'abama asked and obtained
have to lav on the table the folio ungamendment,
which he wished to have moved to the sub-Trea-
surv bill II was also ordered, on his motion, to
be printed
In the 3d section strike out all after the word
"office," in the fifth line, to the w (rds "ten thou-
sand dollars," in the ninth line, and insert the fol-
lowing
"Ml such excess shall be deposited, without de-
lay, to the credit of the Treasi rer of the United
