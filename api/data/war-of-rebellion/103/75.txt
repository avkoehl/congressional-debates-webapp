Reports of Lieutenant Colonel William C. Bartlett, Second North Carolina Mounted Infantry.

CUMBERLAND GAP, March 5, 1865.

On the 3rd I made a reconnaissance toward Jonesville. Was attacked yesterday morning at Ball's Bridge by about 250 rebels. We whipped them and drove them back up the valley. Owing to high waters I did not follow them over a couple of miles. I had 103 men with me. Has courier arrived with letter of mine to A. G. If so please retain letter till you hear from me. Please answer.

W. C. BARTLETT,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

CUMBERLAND GAP, March 5, 1865.

Part of Giltner's command surrounded Tazewell this a. m. and made a formal demand for surrender. This was refused, and they attacked Jennings with vigor. The enemy was thoroughly beaten, numbers killed and wounded, and Lieutenant Richmond captured. Have as yet no further details. Rebels asked time to bury their dead, but Lieutenant Jennings charged them instead. The attacking force was commanded by Lieutenant-Colonel Prentice, Seventh Confederate Cavalry Battalion.

Lieutenant Colonel W. C. BARTLETT,

Commanding, Cumberland Gap:

Your dispatch received. I congratulate you upon your success. How much force did the enemy have? Is there any reason to suppose that they were the advance of any considerable force, or that it means anything more than a raid?
