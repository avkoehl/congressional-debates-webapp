is no more. He was assassinated at the Marshall House after our troops had taken possession of the city.

I am ignorant of the details of the orders issued to the regiment, and await further instructions. My men are posted advantageously in the streets.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NOAH L. FARNHAM,

No. 5. Reports of Brigadier General M. L. Bonham, C. S. Army, commanding at Manassas, Va.

MANASSAS, VA., May 24, 1861.

By all accounts, the enemy crossed the river last night in large force. They stopped the Leesburg train six miles from Alexandria, a reliable man informs me, who saw them. they may be moving on Leesburg; possibly on us. I have just heard from Hunton. He has taken necessary measures to prevent surprise by rail, but they will not move that way. If they attack us, we will defend the place to the last; but our troops are badly armed and deficient in ammunition. They have captured Ball's dragons. send the ablest engineer to be had.

M. L. BONHAM.

General LEE.

MANASSAS, VA., May 24, 1861.

dispatch received.* Colonel Terrett say two troops of cavalry crossed the Chain Bridge about 12 o'clock in the night. I have ordered some dragoons of Captain Green's company to burn the bridges as soon as practicable. Will immediately send your dispatch to Colonel Hunton, however, who I hope has already accomplished the object. If you can, send some good artillerist and an engineer.

M. L. BONHAM.

General LEE.

MANASSAS JUNCTION, VA., May 25, 1861.

COLONEL: Colonel Terrett, with as many of his troops as he could bring off with him, arrived at 11 o'clock,the enemy occupying Alexandria with one thousand troops, as is supposed by Colonel Terrett. If the enemy advance on this line it is manifest that a much large force is necessary here. There are but six hundred infantry here, seven companies of Preston's command having gone to Harper's Ferry. We need artillery very much. There are four small pieces only here. I can order up the two companies of cavalry from Occoquan and Accotink. there is but one troops of cavalry here. With a good engineer I could get on better. Will do the best I can.

In haste, your obedient servant,

M. L. BONHAM.
