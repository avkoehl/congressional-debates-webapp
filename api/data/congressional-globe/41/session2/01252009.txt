perily and growth which history records! A
nation that has never for a single year even
let down the due measure of protectioa for
its own domestic industries that it did not
hasten to restore its time-honored policy at
the earliest opportunity. It has never lacked
advice from the disinterested importers or the
equally disinterested manufacturers of Brit-
ain, and yet-it has steadily preferred to buy its
gooc'i of American manufacturers instead of
our loving and devoted cousins over the water.
A people that steadily refuses to follow the
lessons of theoretical free-trade economists,
and still stubbornly persists in prospering be-
yond all example to the infinite indignation and
disgust of all these economists, both big and
little.
It is a shrewd and practical people, Mr.
Chairman, and knows the difference between
" a hawk and a handsaw." Meetingone of my
copper-mining friends from-the Lake Superior
district a few days ago, he said to me, 1' I hope
you are not going to change the tariff on cop-
per." "My dear innocent friend," said I,
"have you read Wells and the Chicago Tri-
bune ? Don't try to make the 1 water run np
hill' any longer. Wiser men have sought to
solve that problem before." Alas! sir, for
the errors of these practical copper miners.
My friend, with a queer grimace, advised me
to let Wells and the Chicago Tribune "go to
the dogs," but to keep the copper-mining
tariff where it is.
Mr. Chairman, I will not detain the com-
mittee longer. The teachings of an experi-
ence of eighty years are not to be idly thrown
away at the beck of visionary speculators,
whose false facts and false logic tend only to
bewilder the public judgment. The people are
neither oppressed nor impoverished, hdwever
imaginative orators may declaim upon it. We
are on the high road toward national solv-
ency and rational business. Our only serious
difficulty is with the currency, and a full Treas-
ury will speedily lift us out of that. A little
patience and steady perseverance will shortly
bring us to the solid ground of specie pay-
ments, when we can fund our national debt at
a low interest, and regulate the revenues and
expenses upon the basis of stable values and
established peace.
Mr. WINANS. Mr. Chairman, in the pres-
ence of the vital issues of the war and of the
greatquestionswhieh the war precipitated upon
the country the people and the people's Rep-
resentatives inadegree neglected the less im-
portant questions relating to the administration
of the Government, and under cover of the
public good and of the public needs private
interests were suffered to dictate and give com-
plexion to revenue legislation to an extent
unprecedented in the previous history of the
country. When the existence of the nation was
in debate the treasure as well as the blood of
the people was poured ont like water, and so
that the needed supplies were realized the
means by which the Treasury was filled were
not critically considered or regarded. But now
when the integrity of the country is assured,
when the nation, purified and regenerated, has
emerged from the war stronger and substan-
tially unified as never before, the material inter-
ests of a great and mighty people challenge
the attention and demand the consideration of
the people's Representatives.
Everywhere, Mr. Chairman, the people are
sensible of intolerable burdens and are look-
ing to us for relief. Five years have elapsed
since the war, and the revenues and the need
for them are greatly reduced; yet, with only
ยง44,000,000 less of currency than abundantly
sufficed to carry on the war and to meet the
demands of commerce during its progress, the
people are clamoring for more money. Agri-
culture has declined and its products are of
little valuein the market. Foreign commerce
languishes. The price of living is higher than
ever before. The people are in debt, and money
is scarce and to be obtained only at exorbitant
rates of interest. Sensible of their burdens the
people are inquiring, and they expect their
Representatives diligently to inquire into and
remove the causes, and unless relief is given a
day of reckoning between the people and their
servants is near at hand.
I do not pretend, Mr. Chairman, to any skill
in solving financial problems, and cannot hope
to enlighten the House touching questions of
political economy; but with your indulgence
I may say that which may be made the occa-
sion for gentlemen wiser and better informed
to enlighten the country upon many important
questions imperfectly understood.
It seems to me, Mr.' Chairman4 that the
questions relating to the currency, to the pub-
lic debt, and to the taxes are so intimately
connected; so dependent upon each other and
blended in their operation, that they can only
properly be considered together, or at least as
being materially affected each by the others.
Absolutely and independently considered
there can be no fixed and inflexible standard
as to the volume of currency which is needed.
The amount required must needs fluctuate and
vary according to the business to be transacted
and the prices of the articles of commerce.
With far less of currency than we now have the
business of the country was easily and satisfac-
torily transacted before the war,andtheincrease
of business has not been in proportion to the
increased volume of the currency. I assume,
therefore, that in a generally healthy condition
of business the present volume of the currency
is largely in excess of the needs of the country;
and it follows that the general demand for
more currency is occasioned by other causes
than the legitimate requirements of a healthy
commerce. True, it may be urged that the
present currency is depreciated as compared
with coin, and that more is therefore needed ;
but it may be replied that the currency is not
nearly so greatly depreciated as during the
war when its volume was ample, and that to
increase its volume would depreciate the whole
to the extent of the inflation.
A paper currency based upon and redeem-
able in coin at the pleasure of the holder will
not likely become depreciated, whatever may
be its volume. The prices of commodities
rather will respond to the fluctuations in vol-
ume of the currency ; but an irredeemable cur-
rency, whether issued by the Government, by
banks, or individuals, must necessarily depre-
ciate, and if absolutely irredeemable must
become absolutely worthless, except in the case
ot' Government notes receivable for taxes, to
the extent that such quality will give them
value. The legal-tender character of Govern-
ment notes will not save them from deprecia-
tion, as is abundantly proven by our recent
and our present experiences; and for the rea-
son that although if constitutionally authorized
we may give to paper the character of money
so far as our own country and people are con-
cerned, we must deal with other nations on
the basis of the world's currency; and unless
we decline, and exclude foreign commerce alto-
gether, and surround ourselves commercially
with a Chinese wall, we cannot avoid the bring-
ing of our currency to the standard universally
established among the nations.
Permit me to remark in this connection, Mr.
Chairman, that while it is greatly to be regretted
that the Democratic party should have become
so oblivious of its antecedents as to have be-
come the peculiar advocate of the illimitable
issue of paper money, it is gratifying to know
that by the recent decision of the Supreme
Court, such issue, if authorized, can no longer
be the means ofropudiating debt, whether public
or private. Eminent members of the Demo-
cratic party in 1862, including the distinguished
gentleman of my own State, whose name is
identified with the scheme of repudiating the
public debt by inflating the legal-tender cur-
rency, denounced the issue of such currency as
unwarranted by the Constitution, and the mem-
bers of that party, find the party itself-prior t6
that time, had with great unanimity maintained
that bank issues, whether national'" br State,
were alike unauthorized.
But, Mr. Chairman, many Republicans, and
wise, favor inflation of legal-tender currency,
or at least oppose contraction ;โข and some, dis-
tinguished; have seen the direst consequences
following- upon a resumption of specie pay-
ments and have greatly deprecated a general
decision of the Supreme Court demonetizing
the legal-tender notes. I do not share these
views nor fears, Mr. Chairman, but, assuming
healthy legislation in other respects, believe
that a speedy resumption, whether 'by total or
partial funding, or by act of Congress or decis-
ion of the Supreme Court, taking away the
legal-tender character of Government notes, or
by the operation of the laws of trade, would
greatly conduce to and promote the true inter-
ests of the wliole country. The effect of making
Government notes to be in legal effect what
they are in fact, mere promises to pay, would
only be to change the standard of values ; and
whereas gold now commands a premium green-
backs would then be at a discount, arid prac-
tically and substantially all things would con-
tinue as they were. Nor do I believe' that the
debtor class, as many suppose, would be ruined
by resumption. If it be important to the inter-
ests of such that the present volume of currency
should be maintained, that might be done upon
a specie basis; for, adding the hoarded coin to
the circulation of the banks, there would be
sufficient; and if not, expansion might safely
and securely be resorted to in the direction of
the national banks, or of State banks upon a
similar basis of security.
But to return; why is it, Mr. Chairman, that
having nearly as much currency now as during
the war, when we had a superabundance,
why is it that with the present volume com-
paratively greatly appreciated, and with the
volume of business not greatly increased, why
is it that there is not sufficient currency now
to do less business than during the war? I
shall endeavor to answer this question before
I shall have concluded my remarks.
With regard to the public debt much has
been said and some things done which it were
well perhaps had not been said and were left
undone. While repudiation is odious the pay-
ment of the public debt is not a subject upon
which to become enthusiastic. Honest men
and honest nations recognize their obligation
to pay their debts; but payment cannot be said
to be an enjoyable business. After the pro-
ceeds have been consumed, whether they be
bread and meat and clothing, or ships and forts
and columbiads, or powder and lead andother
munitions of war, the debt is stale ; a.nd
whether it be the debt of an individual or of a
nation it is paid because of the obligation, legal
or moral, or both, and in either case is but
payment for a dead dog.
The occasion which requires nations or
individuals to contract a debt is to be depre-
cated, and the debt contracted is a burden not
pleasant to be borne; but being contracted it
can honorably be discharged only by honest
payment, and payment, in the case of nations,
as in the case of individuals, can only be made
by husbanding resources and practicing econ-
omy. The late decision of the Supreme Court
settles the question that the public debt can-
not be paid by new issues of legal-tender
promises to pay, and as there is not a suffi-
cient amount of greenbacks now in circula-
tion with which to pay if the Government had
them all, it follows that the public debt is pay-
able in gold and silver coin. This is much
more satisfactory to the public creditor, and
much more effectually vindicates the public
faith and honor, than the act to improve the
public credit, passed last spring,, because tfie
decision of the Supreme Court is less bfcely
to be overruled than lhat act to be repealed.
Seeing, then, that the debt is to be paid, and
to be paid in coin, it becomes us, Mr. Chair-
man* as the Representatives of the people, to
