Commanding Ninety-ninth Ohio Volunteers, Butler, Ky.:

Orders have been sent to Colonel Runkle and yourself to go to Falmouth, and await orders, with your regiment. Send out parties and gain through them and in other reliable ways all the information you can regarding the enemy. If threatened by superior forces you will fall back toward Covington.

OFFICER COMMANDING FORCES LOUISVILLE, KY.:

Adjutant-General Finnell has information that the enemy is following up Gilbert in considerable force, and that a larger one is following. Commence at once to do all you can toward the defenses of the place, by throwing up breastworks, digging rifle pits, &amp;c., calling out citizens, black and white, for the purpose. Make also the proper dispositions of the forces remaining at Louisville for the defense of the place and for supporting our forces when they fall back. Confer with Governor Robinson and Adjutant-General Finnell. I doubt the information received by General Finnell.

LOUISVILLE, KY., September 4, 1862.

Major General HORATIO G. WRIGHT:

May I be permitted to suggest that you cause your forces to be thrown forward on the Covington and Lexington Railroad as far as possible? The necessity and importance of this disposition of your troops are so obvious as to require nothing more than its suggestion. The same order ought to be made in regard to the forces under your command on the railroad from Louisville to Lexington. I deeply regret that this has not been done at an earlier period, so as to have protected the capital of the State, which could have been done, from all the information I have, with entire success. The necessity of this order for the safely of Kentucky is in my judgment imperative, and is submitted to you under all the responsibilities of my official position. answer quick.
