line during continuance of truce. He has put some field guns in position on the right of Howlett House Battery outside his main line. One deserters from right of enemy's line came in to-day-reported no change on that portion of line. I think the brigade of Mahone's division referred to by General Grant must be Cox's, which has not manned the main line for some time, but has been in reserve on their right.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point:

How do matters stand now? On this front we tried the Bermuda part, but Mahone was there, and we only got the picket-line. From prisoners, deserters, and observation we learn that there is no change as yet.

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., April 2, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

Referring to your dispatch of this evening I beg to say that the work goes bravely on. Our boats are now well up and we have a continuous line from the Appomattox below Petersburg to the river above and will intrench to-night. Our prisoners estimated at over 12,000, with 50 pieces of artillery. A portion of Foster's division made a gallant charge, capturing an important fort and its garrison. Everything looks well.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major-General WEITZEL,

Army of the James:

You need not assault in the morning unless you have good reason for believing the enemy are leaving. We have a good thing of it now and in a day or two I think I will be able to send you all the troops necessary.
