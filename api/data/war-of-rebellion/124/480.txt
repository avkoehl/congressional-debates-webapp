III. By the term "aged and infirm parents," section 2, enrollment act, is meant those parents who, from old age or infirmity, are disabled from arranging the means of supporting themselves, and who, by reason of such age of infirmity, have become dependent for the means of support upon the person claiming exemption from draft. Boards of enrollment will use a careful discrimination in deciding all such cases.
