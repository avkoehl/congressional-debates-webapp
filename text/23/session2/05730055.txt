THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

In the delibuations of the Executive Dnectory
on July 31, 1798, it is stated, that such mfoim-
ation has been received as to ' leave no room to
' doubt, that French cruisers, orsuch is call them-
' selves Fiench, hive infringed the laws of the
'Republic, íclative to ciuismg and prizes "
And in a deciee of the 18th of Mai ch, 1799, the
Executive Directoiy admits, that tht former
deciee " in what relates to the íole- d'equipage,
'with which ueutialve-stls ought to be furnished,
' has had impropei mteipietitions, so far as con
'can  the íol^s d 'equipage of Anrnicari vessels,
'and that it is time to do away the obstacles lesult
' ing theiefiom, to the navigation of vessels of
' that nation
Oui    Envovs,  c] uming   compensation  fiom
Trance, find Fiance also c' Aiming a fulfillment on
oui pait of the ti   xtirs, and in then letter of 17th
May, 1800, to  the Scuetaiy of State, they say,
" Om success is doubtful      Tin   Frtneh think it
' haid to indemnify foi violating engagements,
' unless they can thereby be restoied to the bene
'fits of them " Th" objection heic, then, is not to j
making an indemnity, but to making it vv thout
liavi igthe I cm fit of the sametieatu s,foi the vio   |
lation of which we claimed ofthcra compensation   j
The French Mm st^rs in thin pioposal to the ,
Ameucan. envoys, undei dati llih Augist, 1800, '
says " Thus, the fust propos tion of tin Mm I
'isteis of Fiance is to stipulate a full andentue '
' locosmtion of tieaties,-uid tht rccipiociltngagr j
' ment of compensation foi d"ma"Vsiesu]!ingon

If this is noo pe"entcd, thev t! en piopose " the
abolition of mcicnt treaties," md, in such case, ,
" tVie would 1 e no dimand of compensation "
Here, then,is an offer of compensation for in
lunes to oai   citizens" mide  by Fiance, but she ,
tlaimcu compensition fiom the United States for '
the non-f ilfillment of tin   m ities, and that the
compensado i should be íecipio^al                           \
These  c'aims  of Fi nice against  the Umt"d
Stitcs aiose out of oui   neglect oi refusal, is she
alleged, to fulfill the "tip il Uior- of trei íes    Tin y
vvei'e, first   the )lth aitirie of the treaty of vlli
an"e of 6th rcbruaiy   1778     Th s aiticle stipu
lated the guaiantee shovTd be on the part of " the i
'United States to his Most Chnstian Majesty, I
' the piestnt possessions of the crown of 11 nice
' in America, as well as those w Inch it may ac
' quire by the future treaty of France   '
And, secondly, the 17th and 22d aiticlesof the
tieity of commcice of the same date By the
fust ot these articles, the privateeis and piizes of
Fiance might enter our ports and aepaitatpleas
rue, and the pnvateei" and vessels of the enemies
of France wire excluded fiom oui ports And
the lattei article piohibited the pnvateeis of the
enemies ot Fiance fiom being fitted out in out
poits, and sale of then prizes being made m
them, or even piovision furnished moie than was
necessaiy foi then going to the nt xt port
The impoitance of the stipulations to France
will be ieadil> acknowledged, when wc remember
that she was at wai with England that she had
isHnds in the West Indies to be pies"ived that,
by having a place of íefuge in ou ports for her
aimed vessels, she could g-eatly haiass and m
juic the veiv extensive commeice
of England in
the West Indies, take her vessels, and íetieat m
safety with them to om ports
Our Government, it is well known, determined
to maintain a stuct neutrality between the con
tending pai ties, and refused to France the advaut
ages which these ti aties ga\e hei, and tl is
cotuse was the occasion of gicat complaint and
of ivtry sh up cor*espond< nee between the Min-
ister of Fiance and of this Government.
Ii the couise of the negotiation to settle the
difficulties between the two nations, oui Minis
teis not being authorized oi willing to agre" to
" the íecipiocal engagement of compensation foi
damages lesultmg on both sides" fiom the bieaeh
of the tieaties *as pioposed by France, off id
finally, in then lettci of the 20th of August, 1800,
that the ancient treaties should be rem wed and
confiimcd, with ceitain modifications These
vvtie, that the articles lopeeting pnvateers aid
pnzes should beso modified as, upon payment
of 3,000,000 fi ancs withm sev en years, no gi eater
uo-lits than those of the most favored nations
should exist and that the mutual guaiantee
should, for the future, be considered as fulfilled,
by affoidmg aid to the amount of 1,000/100 of
francs, when eithci party was attacked, and that
either party might " exonerate itself wholly fiom
' its obligation by paying to the othei, within
' seven yeais, a gioss sum of 5,000,000 of francs
'm money, oi such si cuntits as may be issued
' foi indemnifies," vnd th U " there shall be a íe
'cipiocal stipulation foi indemnities and these
'indemnities shall be limited to the claims of indi
'viduals " It will b" noticed hei that the United
States M msters do not offei to Fiance any com
pensa'ion for the injury to Fiance as a nation, for
the claims respecting the guaiantee and the pnv
lieges foi pnvateers and prizes for the past
The Bicnch Mimsteis, on the 25th of August,
say that then pioposal to confim the ancient
tieaties, and foi mutu il compensation " did uv\ ly
all idea of a modification, ' vnd th it, as the Amei
lean Mmist rs had pi oposed an e«senti d modifi
cation of the seventeenth article, ' it is therefore
' evidenttha this noteief is to the second put of
'the alteinitivi, which consisted of a new treaty,
' without indemnity "
" lbc riench Vhmsteis therefore insist upon
' the condition, that all stipulation foi indemnities
' be laid aside   '
They make the following pioposmons to our
Minister
" 1st The ancient ticaties shall becontmud
'and confiimcd to have then full foict, vs if no
' misundeisanding between the two nations had
' evei oceuired
"2d Commissioners shall be appointed to
'hqiidatc the lcspccme losses
" 3d The seventeenth aitick of the tieaty of
' commeicc of 1778 shall be continued in full foicc
' with a s ngle addition, immediately afki these
' vvoids, to wit ' And on theco itrary, no shekel
' sha'I be g veil in th ir ports oi hubois to such as
' sh ill h v madi pi zc of the "ubjects of his Ma
' ¡ sty, or of the citizens of the United Stito,'
' theie shall be added, ' if it 1 e not m vir uo of
1 k low n ti eaties on the day of tht signature of the
'pi esc it,andsiibsequ< nttodie tieaty of 1778, and
' that foi the space of seven vcais I he twenty
' second aiticl subject t) the same aseivation as
' the s venteenth ai icle
"4th If, duung the term of seven veais,the
' pioposal to establish the seventeenth and twnty
• second articl s I e not made and accepted inthout
' resettle, the ivvard foi indemnities determined by
' the commissionns shall not be allowed
"5th   1 ho guarantee stipulated by the treaty
' of alliance shall bo converted m o a giant of
' succor for two millions     But this giant shall
' not be íedeemable unless by a capital of ten mil
' lions   '
These pvoposals not being satisfaetoiy to the
Ameiican Ministers, the Fiench Mimsteis made
o i the 4th of feeptembci, 1800, proposals anew
"We shall have the nDht to take oui  prizes
< into the poi ts of America
"A commission shall resalíate the indemnities
' vvl ich eithei of the two nations may owe to tin
' eiti-eiis of the othei The indemnities which
' shall be due by Fiance shall be paid by the llmted
' States     And, ill return for which, France yields
< tht exclusive pnuiege resulting from the seven
' ttcnth and twenty second articles of the treaty
' of commeice, and f-om the rights of guai intte
'of the eleventh article of the tieaty of alliance "
The Ameucan Mimsteis answer on the 6th of
September, uid say these proposal are inadmis
sible     " The neaitst approach to them ' is
"1st Ihe foimei tieaties shall be renewed
' and confirmed
"2d The obligations of the guaiantee shall
' be specified and limited as in the fii st paiagraph
' of then third pioposition of the 20th of August
«3d   Theie shall be mutual indemnity and a
<  mutual restoration of captmed piopeity not yet
'definitely condemned, accoidmg to then fifth
' and sixth propositions of th-t date
"4th If, at the exchange of i atificatioiis, the
' united States piopose a mutual rehnquishmert of
'indemnity, the Fiench Republic mil ague to fie
'same and in such case the formti tieaties shall
' not he deemed obligatory, except under the sev
'entcenth and twenty second articles of that of
'commeice, the paities shall lontinue forevei to
' have for their public ships of wai, privateers,
' and prizes, such privileges in the ports of each
' other as the most favored nation shall enjoy
The American Mimsteis lequesteda confei
ence to consider these propositions, and in their
journal, under 12th September, they say, " The
' first and third were agiesd to, with some modifi-
' cation of the third as to the íules of evidence,
'which did not lary its principle " The second
and fourth were consideied together, as m some
measuie connected, and, after considerable dis-
cussion, the Tiench Ministers said, "Unless an
' option perfectly similar and recipiocal was as-
sured to the Fiench Republic, the opeiation of
' which would enable h°r to get rid of the indemmtic,
' by an offer of abandoning the exclusive pnvdeges,"
they could not agice to it
Here it will be noticed that it was tig"eed that,
upon the foimer tieaties being confiimed,indem-
nities should be paid, but Fiance would not yield
hei exclusne lights tinder the treaties, but by pay-
ment being made to fltn citizens by their own Gov-
ei mnent, 011 y a i ehnquiihment if indemnities %UT
Mimsteis were not authonzed to íelinquishlthe
indemnities, or to provide for their payment by
the United States and henee they say on the
13thSeptembei in their jouinal,that "being now
'convinced that" the dooi was peifectly closed
' against all hope of obtaining indemnities uith
' am/ modifications o} the tieaties, it lcmamed only
' tobe determined to attempt a temporal y an ange-
' ment,.which would extucate the United States
' fi om the war, oi that peculiai st ite of hostility
' m which they aie at piesent involved "
This is not an allegation that indemnity could
not be obtained at all, but only that it could not
be obtained without a pei foi manee on out pait of
the obligations i lto which we had enteied by our
tieaties with France
Here, then, let us contemplate the condition of
the negotiation and state of facts admitted by
both parties     Wi have seen th it the proposals
of the Ameucan Ministers, that the former treat-
ies be confnmed and that theie should be mutual
indemnities, weu agreed to   Butthc Fiench Mm
istris would not assent to the Americans only
havng the light to lehnquish the indemnities as
a consideration for their discharge from the 17th
and 22d articles of the treaty of commerce     Let
it be lemembeied that the claims of France can
not be regarded as destioycd by the act of July
7, 179b, annulling the treaties, even if we admit
that one paity to a tieaty can annul it by a legis-
lative act     Both partn s to the tieaties admitted
then validity until that act of 1798 was passed
For five yeais before the treaties were declaied
by the U uted States to be annulled, France had
not had  the benefit of the peculiar privileges
s cured to her    Not that the Administration of
that day is bl imed, it might be wise to refuse to
giant these privileges, and rely upon making a
pioper recompense, or upon finding an excuse
toi íefusing it in  the wiongs done to us    Our
Goven ment is a paiental Government     It was
flamed and exists for the piomotion of the hap
pinessof the people—for the pi otection and secu-
nty of the lights and propeitv of the citizens
It was bound by eveiy duty to obtain indemnity
for these citizens, if it could do so consistently
with its duties to othei citizens     It could have
obtained con pentatlón for them without impos
mo- any heavier buideh upon other citizens than
apeiformance of the duties enjoined by existing
treaties     Oi it might have obtained indemnity
for these classes by causing their losses to be
made good by all  the citizens, that is, by the
nation, as a consideration of a dischaige fiom
the tieaty  stipulations     Was it not just, that
the consideration foi tht discharge of the treaty
stipulations should be boine by the whole, and
not by a poition—and an unfortunate poition—■
of its citizens >   This Government cannot plead
that it will notobtam an indemnity for its citizens
of Ti anee, because Fiance had claims against the
1 United Statis of a national character to a like
amount    It should keep the claims of thecitizens
against Fiance separate fiom the claims of a na
tional  character against itself    If France had
I clums against the United States, those should
have been satisfied by the whole people of the
United States, and to make use of such claims
egainst itself as an excuse for not obt.ainmg com-
pensation for losses incurred by a portion ot its
citizens, is to impose upon that small portion the
burden which should be boine by the whole It
is, in effect, to take pnvate property for public
u«es without just compensation
And if this has been done, the claimants are
entitled to a fair compensation
