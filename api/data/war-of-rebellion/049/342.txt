OCTOBER 17, 1863-10. 30 p. m.

Major-General SEDGWICK,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

The major-general commanding has directed me to send you the accompanying copy of a dispatch* from General Kilpatrick, received since Colonel McMahon left here. This would indicate that the infantry force near you was small. The fact could probably be ascertained by your pushing the enemy in the morning and making him show his hand. Colonel McMahon will inform you of the disposition made by the commanding general.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 17, 1863-10. 30 p. m.

Commanding Officer Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that he has directed a bridge to be thrown at either Mitchell's or Blackburn's Ford, in connection with the advance of the regular cavalry brigade to Manassas, to ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy. The bridge will be thrown at the ford which can be most easily and completely covered by you, and Captain Mendell has been directed to receive your instructions thereupon.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, October 17, 1863-11. 20 p. m.

Commanding Officer Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that General Sedgwick reports that the enemy has infantry pickets on the old ox road, opposite Chantilly, and directs that you move your corps to Fairfax Court-House to-morrow morning at the hour fixed for the movement of Griffin's division.

Very respectfully, &c.,

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

[Indorsement.]

Countermanded at 11. 30 p. m., and directed to hold himself ready to move at daylight and at any moment after. Griffin ordered to move as before directed.
