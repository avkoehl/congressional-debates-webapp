lifinny, to Coosaw. Our troops met and drove them back, but were in return driven back demoralized, and occupied works at Coosaw. General Gartrell has just telegraphed me that he can hold that place. I am endeavoring, and think will succeed, to collect a force of 5,000 or 600 men to attack in their rear, on road from Old Pocotaligo to Coosaw, at daylight.

Major STRINGFELLOW:

Forward this through to General Hardee at Savannah: There are two trains with troops from Wilmington and train with light artillery from Augusta on this side of bridge, waiting for the road to be cleared to go on. A train of North Carolina State troops will reach here at 1 a. m. ; will hurry them on immediately. There are four trains on Savannah railroad due here, blocking the way.
