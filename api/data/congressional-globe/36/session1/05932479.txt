but plunder.

The natural inquiry should be, Mr. Speaker,
as to what has become of the great excess. Read
the evidence before the committee, of Judge Black,
Mr. Appleton, and Mr. Collector Baker of Phila-
delphia.
Mr. BARKSDALE. Has that testimony been
printed by order of the House?
Mr. HA SKIN. Yes, sir.
Mr. BARKSDALE. In this case?
Mr. HASKIN. Certainly. The report was
made on the 26th of March, and ordered to be
printed. Look at the evidence of Judge Black,
of Mr. Appleton, of Collector Baker of Phila-
delphia, of Mr. Wendell, and of Judge Nichol-
son—a member of the Senate—as printed by the
Senate Printer, and you will find that this money
was distributed, by arrangement between these
parties—$10,000 per annum—toward the sustain-
ing of the Pennsylvania!!, a partisan organ of the
President. When it was disco vei ed that the profits
of the printer of the Post Office blanks amounted
to more than ten thousand dollars a year, what
was the first proposition of the President? He in-
sists that $5,000 additional shall be paid toward
the sustaining of the Evening Argus, of Philadel-
phia!
In addition to the use thus made by the Presi-
dent and Judge Black, his Attorney, in creating
public opinion to sustain this imbecile and totter-
ing Administration, by supporting the newspa-
pers I have mentioned, $10,000 more was used in
sustaining the President's home organ, the Con-
stitution, under the editorial management of Gen-
eral Bowman, the Senate and Executive Depart-
ment Printer. .
Mr. BARKSDALE. With the permission of
the gentleman from New York, I desire to remark
that this very session he voted for a candidate for
Printer who had agreed to give half the profits of
the printing for electioneering purposes, and to
carry the next presidential election.
Mr. HASKIN. 1 suppose I am not on trial
here; and if I did vote for a candidate who made
such an agreement, I had no knowledge of the
fact.
Mr. BARKSDALE. I recollect that the gen-
tleman stated on this floor that he had voted for
a gentleman who proposed to give half the profits
of the printing for electioneering purposes. Does
the gentleman deny that?
Mr. HASKIN. It is that very subject which
the Committee on Public Expenditures desire to
reform by the proposition which they will ask
the gentleman from Mississippi to vote for,if he is
in favor of retrenchment and reform. I desire
not to be interrupted again on irrelevant points.
Mr. BARKSDALE. I am not committing my-
self for or against this bill, for i have not determ-
ined what I shall do in regard to it; but I desire
the country to understand that the gentleman
himself voted for a candidate for Printer who
made this corrupt proposition, and that he was
aware of it at the time.
Mr. HASKIN. I cannot be interrupted by the
gentleman from Mississippi on immateriaipoints.
it is immaterial how he or I voted.
Mr. FLORENCE. It is a strong reason why
you should correct it,and you are attempting that.
Mr. HASKIN. We arc going to cauterize, to
cut out, this putrid excrescence on the body-poli-
tie, if possible.
Mr. FLORENCE. And I hope wc will all help
you.
Mr. BARKSDALE. I understand that the can-
didate of the Republican party for Printer, Mr.
Defrees, proposed that he would divide the profits
of the printing with the Republican party, giving
that party one half of the profits, to be used in the
prosecution of the next presidential campaign*
That man was the caucus nominee.
Mr. THEAKER. And was defeated.
Mr. BARKSDALE. He received the votes of
the Republican party.
Mr. KEITT. Every one, but one.
Mr. HASKIN. I desire to correct the state-
merit made by the gentleman from Mississippi.
He says that I voted for Mr. Defrees, with the
knowledge that he had made a proposition that
he would give half the profits of the public print-
ing toward sustaining his party. I state to the gen-
tleman that I had no knowledge of it at the time.
It came out afterwards, in evidence before my
committee.
The evidence of Mr. Defrees shows that he had
proposed, before he was nominated in caucus, to
a friend, being a member of Congress from In-
diana, to contribute half the profits of the public
printing towards the dissemination of Republican
documents, for the purpose of assisting in the elec-
tion the ensuing fall.
Mr. BARKSDALE. To be used in the pres-
idential campaign. I desire to asli the gentleman
from New York if that statement was not made
in the caucus that nominated Mr. Defrees; and if
he was not present at the time, and did not hear it?
Mr. HASKIN. No, sir.
Mr. BARKSDALE. My recollection is, that
the gentleman himself has admitted on this floor
that he was present, not as a member of the party,
but as an ally.
Mr. HASKIN. The gentleman is mistaken.
The first knowledge I had of it was through the
papers, the next day after the caucus was held.
But that is an immaterial issue. It only shows
that there is so much the greater reason for the
adoption of the joint resolution proposed by the
majority of the Committee on Public Expendi-
tures. Now, I must insist on proceeding with my
argument.
Mr. BARKSDALE. Did not the gentleman
from New York vote for Defrees, as the nominee
of the Republican party, after he was aware that
that proposition had been made ?
Mr. HASKIN. I have no recollection on the
subject; but I do not see fit to be catechised about it,
IVtr. BARKSDALE. I have no idea that the
