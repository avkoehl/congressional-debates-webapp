Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of Northern Virginia:

Enemy burned furnace at lead-mines on evening of 17th and retired toward Marion. My last dispatch from General Breckinridge was 6 p. m. 16th, at Saltville. Indications are that he is beleuguered. His force is 1,600 cavalry and a few reserves. Enemy's force at least 4,500. Should disaster befall him the force at New River-700 reserves of loose organization-cannot hold the line of New River, and the country will be open to Lynchburg. there is no cavalry in this department except with General Breckinridge, Vaughn's brigade being scattered and disorganized. Will re-establish telegraphic communication with Wytheville in a few hours, and will keep you advised of latest information.

J. STODDARD JOHNSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, December 19, 1864.

Major J. S. JOHNSTON:

Telegram received. Order troops down from New River as you suggest. General Early has been directed to send a brigade or more by rail to New River. Communicate with him if the troops are not needed, so that they may be stopped. Who is in command of troops now at New River?

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Breckinridge, leaving garrison of 500 men at salt-works, met enemy and fought him yesterday near Marion. Result indecisive, though he repulsed him frequently with slight loss to himself. My judgment is that, leaving bridge guard at New River, the troops here should be sent to Wytheville, where, should he fall back, he would reasonably expect to find them. In absence of his orders my position does not authorize me to order a movement so important. I apprise you of status here in order that general commanding may instruct me as exigency requires.

J. STODDARD JOHNSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS,December 19, 1864.

Major J. S. JOHNSTON:

Collect all the reserves and organize them under good officers. Erect works at New River, and hold the line of communication with Breckinridge, that, if necessary, he can fall back to that line.

R. E. LEE.
