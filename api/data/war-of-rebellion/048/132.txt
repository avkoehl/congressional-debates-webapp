rebel picket station; since then the poles are up and most of the wire left. If we should get to Culpeper and remain, it would probably be an easy matter to open the telegraph. So far the rails are on the road undisturbed, but the road has not been used for a long time.

CULPEPER COURT-HOUSE, 5 P. M.,

Via Rappahannock, 6.55 p.m., September 13, 1863.

The head of my column is now here. I shall camp to-night, if nothing happens, in position just before reaching the town on the side of Mountain Run toward the Rappahannock. There is some artillery firing going south of us some 3 miles, but it is diminishing and receding. The railroad is in good order to this place, and the bridge over Mountain Run is standing. A train left here about three hours ago for Richmond, so the route is open all the way through. The telegraph line is almost perfect after you get about 3 miles out from Rappahannock Station. I send paper of the 10th.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 13, 1863-8.30 p.m. (Received 1.45 a.m., 14th.)

I have just seen General Pleasonton's dispatch of 5.30 p.m. General Webb's brigade is in Culpeper Court-House to-night. I am encamped just outside of it. I shall put a division across to-morrow to the south of the town, about 2 miles, while General Pleasonton is this die of the Rapidan. If he goes south of the Rapidan, I shall send some force down to the ford to help him that far, and stay till he returns. I have been unable to get any special information about the enemy's disposition.

CULPEPER,

September 15, 1863.

Lieutenant Roebling says the railroad is in good order all the way to Mitchell's Station, and the bridge over Cedar Run is all right. The telegraph line is also good. Lieutenant Roebling has been up all night, but I have sent the order about the reconnaissance to General Pleasonton. His headquarters are about 1 mile from Mitchell's Station. The Raccoon and Somerville Ford are defended by intrenchments, and they had last night at Somerville Ford fourteen guns. They hold this side of the river at the Rapidan Railroad
