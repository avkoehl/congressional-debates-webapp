In my opinion the efficiency of the military telegraph might be greatly enhanced if more thoroughly organized and its organization were better understood by army officers generally. It appeares to me that it might be advantageously consolidated with the Signal Corps of the Army. With officers of telegraphic experience, duly commissioned, and plenty of means placed at their disposal, it could be made and indispensable arm of the regular service. Rules and regulations should be established for its guidance and protection, and the same should be embolied in the Army Regulations, so that every army officer might be fully posted in regard to its organization. Thus systematized, with rules to prevent the interference of outside officers, it might be made much more efficient and useful to the army than now. Although it is now very efficient and useful, there are many things which might be added to make it much more so.

Very respectfully,

SAML. BRUCH,

Captain and Assistant Quatermaster

and Assistant Superintendent U. S. Military Telegraph.

LENIOR'S, [October] 29, 1863.

General WILLCOX:

It is clear that a very heavy force is moving up between Athens and Loundon, concentraing with a view to compelling us to evacuate East Tennessee. I have withdrawn the forces from Loundon to the heights this side the river, commanding the place, but I hope by some contemplated movements of troops to thwart their design. If Grant should press Bragg, they, of course, would have to fall back. I shall leave here for Knoxville to-morrow.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

[31.] Major-General.
