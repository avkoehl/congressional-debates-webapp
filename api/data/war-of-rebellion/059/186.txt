LOUISVILLE, March 29, 1864.

Brigadier-General HOBSON, Cave City:

Forrest, with a large force, is reported between the Tennessee and Cumberland; was near Rockcastle, Ky. You will order Grider's command from Scottsville to Bowling Green without delay. You will also order Weatherford's and Hanson's regiments to concentrate at Columbia, with a view to throwing them into Eastern Kentucky, in the vicinity of Richmond. There is but little doubt that a large rebel force is about to invade the State by way of Pound Gap. Order Weathereford to make the proper disposition of the stores at Burkesville.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brigadier-General.

A detachment of Forrest's command is reported across the Cumberland and moving toward Union City; said to be less than 100 men. You will join Colonel Starling and report to him. A force from Hopkinsville in same direction.

Major-General SHERMAN, Nashville:

I left Paducah at 3.30 p. m. on 27th. Received your dispatch of 27th, about 90 miles above Paducah, at 10.20 a. m. on the 28th. Have made all possible speed to this point. No information about Forrest since I left Paducah. A rumor that he was at Paris and would attempt to cross near the railroad crossing.

Shall push on to Savannah and move to Purdy, as ordered in your dispatch.

Very respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH,

Brigadier-General.
