than I have ever been before, and hope no officers will be sent into the department who rank those who are now with me. I am sorry to say it, but I would regard it as particularly unfortunate to have either McClernand or Wallace sent to me. The latter I could manage if he had less rank, but the former is unmanageable and incompetent. I would bespeak for General Hamilton promotion. He has earned it on the battle-field, and is competent. Besides this there is not a single major-general from Wisconsin, and some day they may claim one and give the rank to some less worthy person.

The people of Mississippi show more sings of being subdued than any we have heretofore come across. They are very cordial in their reception of the Federal officers, and seem desirous of having trade resumed.

I have been waiting on the reports of the cavalry subdued than making mine. If they are not handed in within a few days I will make mine, and submit theirs when received.

I am under many obligations to you for the confidence with Mr. Washburne says you expressed in me, and will endeavor not to disappoint you.

Yours, truly,

U. S. GRANT.
