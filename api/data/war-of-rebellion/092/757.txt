[General HOWARD:]

GENERAL: The enemy evacuated his position opposite me this morning, probably impelled by some movement on his flank. I have put one brigade of Second Division across, and am making preparations to cross the entire Second Division, when I will push toward King's Bridge and to the nearest point on the railroad. There is a great deal of traffic over the Gulf road, trains passing almost continually. I will report again as soon as I have anything new to report.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
