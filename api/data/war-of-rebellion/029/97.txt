[Major] Johnson's battalion of mounted rifles (250) was at Kingsport, or its vicinity, 7 miles from Big Moccasin Gap, and about 17 miles from Bristol.

I directed Major Johnson to repair that night to Kingsport, and draw his force back in the direction of Bristol until he formed a junction with Clay. I hoped by this arrangement to have my forces disposed to meet the enemy whichever way he came, and to hold him in check until I could re-enforce at his point of assault, so as to repulse or capture him.
