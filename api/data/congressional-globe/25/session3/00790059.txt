time, though at diffeient times lie had given votes
¡somewhat diffeient, obeying theiein the dictates
of his own judgment
The SPE AKER remarked that that subject was
not now imdei consideration
Mi POULDIN said if the Chai- would give
him only about one t nth the latitude allowed to
the gentleman fiom Massachusetts, he could get
out all he wanted
The SPEAKER said that remarks made out of
order could not be replied to in order The gen-
tleman fiom Massachusetts had been arrested m
his remarks whenever they tiansgressed the
propei limit
Mr BOULDIN If the Chair succeeds no bet-
ter with me than with the gentleman from Mas-
The SPEAKER The subject of abolition is
not in oidei
Mr BOULDIN I was going on to explain
why it was that I meant to vote for the gentle-
man's motion, and to give reasons that ate satis
factory to mvstlf, and at the same time I wish
to satisfy those to whom I addiess them that
they aie good reasons If I am not at liberty to
do this, I am not willing to insist upon piocccd
lag out of order I will ask the Chair if I am not
at libeity to state that theieason why I will vote
foi the gt ntieman's proposition is, that the lef-
tienee of the petition and its consideration will
be the means of contnbuting to peace, happiness,
and security, while the refusal to do so will pio-
duce confusion and civil discord-' Are these
reasons in orderoi not'
The SPEAKLIt stated the question was on the
instructions, and not on the reference
Mi BOULDIN undcistood that perfectly well,
and he also understood why be meant to vote fot
them X he íeason was, that the consideiing of
the subject by the committee, and answering it
one way or the othei, would give more peace,
happiness, and seeuuty to the country, while the
icfusal to answer would produce opposite íesults
That was his pnncipal reason and he wished to
show why it was, also, that, at this tune, he
would give that vote, while at another time he
had given an appaiently different vote
Mi B would ask, why not give these mstruc
tions to that committee ' Had notrefeiring be-
foie, and repotting, had a good effect5 Had it
not jnoduced peace and harmony almost through
out the country' Had the refusal to do so done
this5 Had it diminished the applications here5
On the contiary, had it not increased them ' He
would refer this papel and the insuuctions, be-
cause the íefusal to refei, and the lefusal to re
poit, in his judgment—he would not impugn the
motives or judgments of others—had produced
no other effect than he had desciibed He was
foi lefemng it, and for lequinng an answer,
because he was of opinion that the íefusal to
answer would pioduce the effect of misiepiosent
ing the South, that she would not let the Noith
be heaid
The SPEAKER again arrested Mr B forwan-
denng fiom the point
Mi BOULDIN dtd not mean to be out of
oidei, and, with due defeience to the Chair, he
was at a loss to perceive that he was
The SPEAKER ruled otherwise
Mi BOULDIN would submit, then, but still
he was satished that he had a ught to present
such íeasons as would induce him to vote for the
gentle man's proposition, whether they weie so to
the Speaker or not If, howevei, he might be
permitted to finish the sentence he commenced,
he would sit down It is this That by these in-
ferences, diawn fiom this couise, noithern people
aie mide to bel  \e ill it southern people wish to
stop the ir moutl s and tins he did not hold to be
tiue And, by the sime infciences, southern
people aie made to believe that nortni rn people
aie ptepanng to take uparmsand match in battle
au \v o emancipate then slaves, and neithei did
he believe this He hated this entanglement about
rules, special technicalities as they might be
teimed, and if we wete to so to war, Itt us, said
he, go to it about something tangible, and not
about constructions of the rule of the House Let
us at least, know what we are going to be set bv
the iais about He would only add, in conclu
sion th it, by such misrepresentations and mis
chief making as he had íeferied to, the North ai d
the South may be made to hate each othet to that
extent that neither love nor interest can hold them
together
Mr BYNUM then took the floor, and pro-
ceeded to íeply with gieat eainesti ess to tut íe-
maiks of Mi Adívis, and, in the course of it,

Mr TURNEY thereupon moved that the gen-
tleman have leave, and it was granted without a
division

sition to the proposed instructions

this subj ct as derogatoiy to the South
