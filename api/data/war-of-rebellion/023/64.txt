HEADQUARTERS,Camp near Florence, June 25, 1862.

General HALLECK:

One locomotive and nine cars which were off the track the other day got into Tuscumbia yesterday. We have also the locomotive and six cars which have been landed at South Florence and are now on the track. The locomotive is positively unsafe and cannot be relied upon for rendering much service, though it has been patched up and put to light use between this point and Decatur. We have been obliged to detail men from these commands to run these trains. I have therefore called on Mr. Anderson to organize a force to run one train, and the party will be here to-morrow or next day.

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Florence, June 25, 1862.

Colonel McCOOK,

Commanding Second Indiana Cavalry:

Your dispatch by sergeant has been received, as was also your telegram. Your arrangements for sending forward supplies and the conduct of your train to Reynolds' are satisfactory and seem to be working well. The general directs that you remain until further orders at Reynolds' Station, or the terminus of railroad communication if it is moved southerly by repairs, and employ your command in guarding wagon trains between your position and Athens. In sending dispatches two messengers should go together, as it is too severe a tax upon the vigilance of one man to look out properly for himself in passing over a road not entirely safe.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES B. FRY,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Florence, June 25, 1862.

Mr. OSBORNE,

Louisville Journal, Louisville, Ky.:

SIR: I inclose herewith several copies of General Orders, Numbers 26, from these headquarters.* General Buell desires that you will have it printed in the Journal and Democrat for one month, and he also asks that you will do him the favor to have it published in two of the most prominent papers in each of the following-named States for the same length of time: Indiana, Illinois, Ohio, Minnesota, Michigan, Wisconsin, Pennsylvania, and Tennessee. The bills for these publications will be paid on presentation to the quartermaster in Louisville. Please show this letter to Colonel Swords, acting quartermaster-general, that he may understand the subject when the bills come in. I ask the above favor of you, as I do not know the papers. They should not both be in the same place in a State, except perhaps Kentucky.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES B. FRY,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
