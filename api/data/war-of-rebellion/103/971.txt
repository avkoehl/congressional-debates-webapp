Circular address to the absentees from the Tennessee cavalry of Forrest's command.
HEADQUARTERS JACKSON'S CAVALRY DIVISION,Verona, Miss., February 13, 1865.

The undersigned having been recently assigned to command all the Tennessee cavalry in the department, earnestly appeals to the absentees to return to their colors. Feeling indentified with the troops and having an interest in their welfare and reputation, [he] is desirous that they should join him in order to perfect a permament organization upon the basis of system, order, and discipline, that will secure good behavior everywhere, and above all, respect to citizens and their property; that Tennesseeans my be proud of troops from their State and not afraid to see them; and one that will redound to the credit of our beloved and oppressed section. To this end I now call upon all absentees to return at once. If you come voluntarily, I will be proud to receive you. I will not have you, and you need not expect to join, me if brought as prisoners. I earnestly invite the co-operation and support of officers and men to increase the command, and especially do I call upon the citizens of West Tennessee to lend me their aid and assistance in inducing the absentees to return, thereby fillingn up the ranks to respectable numbers. I invite the return of the infantry soldiers who were furloughed to visit West Tennessee to their proper commands, and I now assure them once for all that they will never be permitted to join my command. Any officer who receives one in his command will certainly be dismissed the service for harboring deserters. Our cause needs the services of all absentees, and those becoming of proper age. You have had ample time to provide for your families, and I call on you to join me. I appeal to your pride as Tennesseeans-troops that have never faltered. Let not your action by remaining at home in this hour of our country's trial cast a stigma upon the fair name of West Tennessee-a name won by the gallant deeds of yourselves and our fallen heroes. Come one, come all, and join me. Let us act together and strike a manly blow for independence.

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General FORREST, West Point, Miss.:

Your cipher telegram received. Brigadier-General Ross went west this morning. Action on the matter under discussion had better be delayed a few days for additional information. If found necessary to send infantry you had better go in command of expedition.

When will Armstrong's brigade be ready to move? Do not deem it advisable to move it until something more definite is known about enemy's reported Red River expedition.
