unless frauds should be charged and set out in
an affidavit by the plaintiff, with the facts upon
which the charge of fraud is predicated—stands
thus: That when the plaintiff will swear that the
defendant fraudulently has money in his hands,
and is about to escape from the District; or when
he will swear positively that the defendant fraud-
ulently made a contract, and will not comply with
it—or, in other words, when complying with the
requisitions of the act, he sets forth that he is a
fraudulent debtor, the debtor may be arrested on
mesne process. The operation of this bill will be
to abolish all imprisonment in the District under
mesne process, atyi release all persons who are
. now under arrest under mesne process. I know
it will pass, but I say, I never will give a vote in
the Senate, which, by retrospective legislation,
can affect private rights. I know that there is an
individual now under arrest in the District under
mesne process on the,charge of fraud; I do not
know whether the fraud is properly charged or
not. I believe my friend from North Carolina
will make a very fair and full exposition of the
matter, and if the Senate will pass the bill, I am
willing; but still I do myself the justice to say,
that I was in the minority of the committee which
reported it.
Mr. BADGER. The honorable chairman of
the committee is perfectly correct in saying that
he was not in favor of this bill in the committee.
I will make a very brief statement of my under-
standing of the bill, and attempt to show that it
ought to pass; and having made that attempt, I
shall cheerfully submit the question to the decision
of the Senate. As the law with regard to bail in
the District of Columbia stands now, by the act
of 1842, to which the honorable chairman has re-
ferred, a plaintiff in an action of debt or assump-
sit, has a right to demand bail of the defendant
whenever he files an affidavit, averring, in the first
place, the amount of the action, and then either
one of the following circumstanoes: First, that
the debt was contracted by fraud orfalse pretense;
I or second, through a breach of trust, setting out
! the facts and circumstances out of which these
allegations rise; or thirdly, that the defendant has
i concealed, or is concealing his property in the
District, or elsewhere, with a view to avoid pay-
ing the debt; or fourthly, is about to remove the
same from the District, or from the place of his
residence with the same view; or fifthly, that being
a resident in the District, he is about to abscond
" without paying the debt, and with a view to avoid
paiving the same. As the law stands, if the plain-
tiff will make an affidavit, in which he avers any
one of these five facts to exist, he has a right to
demand bail, and bail must be given, or the party
must remain in prison till the determination of the
suit. That is the state of the law. Now, Mr.
President, the object of the bill under consideration
is, that in all proceedings to recover debts purely,
not interfering at all with actions for real torts, the
party shall not, upon mesne process, be required
to give bail.
1 admit, brought up, as I have been, like the
honorable chairman of the commitee, in the prac-
tice of the profession where the common law pre-
vails, I was for a long time thoroughly wedded to
the system which imprisons a man upon the as-
sertion of the other side that he owes money, or
that he is disposing of his property to avoid the
payment of it, or that he is about to remove, or
for any other circumstance which may be allowed
by law to be sufficient to hold the party in du-
rance until the question shall be decided between
them.
But, sir, I am satisfied that the system cannot
be maintained without leaving the widest range
for abuses and oppression. As the system stands
now, compare it with proceedings in criminal
matters. A man makes his affidavit. It is con-
clusive, and the party arrested must give bail or
go to prison. When he is in prison there is no
day for his deliverance until the determination of
the action, or the determination of the want of
cause of action. But, on the contrary, if a man
be charged with committing any crime against his
country, however grave or serious it may be, im-
mediately after his arrest, although the charge is
sworn against him by an affidavit, he cannot be
detained an hour longer than is necessary to bring
him before an examining court to have an investi-
gation of the case, with an opportunity to produce
i his own proof. And unless, after that examina-
tion, the court is of opinion that there is a proba-
ble cause for his detention, he is entitled to be dis-
charged. I hold it to be inconsistent with the very
genius and principles of American freedom that
one citizen shall be taken upon the suggestion or
the affidavit of another citizen, swearing in his
own case, and for the purpose of recovering money
to be put in his own pocket, and be put in prison
hopelessly till the determination of the case or the
liquidation of the debt, which may last for such a
period of time as sometimes it may last as the
statutes of the United States make some of the
longest terms of imprisonment for a felonious act,
committed by any party. If it were possible, if
we could so arrange the machinery of its operation
that this imprisonment should be awarded only to
the dishonest, fraudulent, worthless debtor who is
endeavoring, or who was endeavoring to entrap
and deceive an honest man, I should have no ob-
jection. But we cannot do it. You must either
abolish the right or leave it as it stands, so that the
affidavit of one party shall be conclusive by which
to hold the other in prison.
The case to which the honorable chairman has
referred is a case which illustrates, in the highest
degree, the effect of the allowing of this power.
Here is a citizen who has been lying ninety days
in one of the prisons of this District, upon the
affidavit of an opposite party; and there he is
obliged to lie, under the law as it now stands, until
lie can bring the action to a close, and have a ver-
dict in his favor. Can it be right? Ought one
freeman to hold his freedom at the will of another,
if the party who chooses to deprive him of it will
support the allegation he makes by his affidavit ?
What is his remedy ? Mr. President, he has
none—he has none; for any action according to
law against the one who makes the affidavit every
professional man knows is worthless. Can he
prosecute him for perjury ? Every professional
man knows that it is worthless to bring an indict-
ment and hope for a conviction upon such an affi-
davit. Therefore, I say it is wrong to leave one
man to be imprisoned on the assertion of another
party, supported by an affidavit, and that assertion
and that affidavit made to put money into his own
pocket. I believe, as we have to choose between
abolishing and leaving this wide field open to abuse
and oppression, the true interest of the country
requires that bail should be abolished in all cases
.of a pure action for debt.
Mr. BUTLER. I do not intend to go into this
subject, for I have acquitted myself of any duty
which I owe to the country by saying what I have
said. But if any one now imprisoned under mesne
process should wish to avail himself of the prison-
bounds acts in the District of Columbia, all he has
to do is, to file a deposition, or make a suggestion
and schedule of his property, and he can escape
upon paying the debt to the man when he has got
the money in his pocket. He can very readily
be relieved by paying the debt.
Mr. BADGER. He denies that he owes it.
Mr. BUTLER. If he does deny it, let the
question be tried. I do not intend to apply the
remark to the case referred to by the honorable
Senator from North Carolina; but there are cases
in which the individual, having the money, ought
to be compelled to pay it to the honest creditor.
I am perfectly willing to shape the law in such a
way as to meet such cases; but I am not willing
to make a sweeping law to abolish imprisonment
for debt in all cases under mesne process. I can-
not go that far; and although the honorable Sen-
ator from North Carolina and myself have both,
perhaps, inclined too much to our common-law
notions, if he has given them up, I cannot.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, and ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, read a third time, and passed.
IOWA JUDICIAL EXPENSES.
Mr. DOWNS. I have been directed by the
Committee on the Judiciary, towhich was referred
the memorial of Lee county, in Iowa, praying a
remuneration for certain fees, to report a bill " to
refund to the county of Lee, Iowa, certain expen-
ses of the district court, which were paid by that
county." This is a bill like one which, last ses-
sion, passed both Houses of Congress in refer-
ence to another county, and I therefore ask that it
may be considered at this time.
The bill was read a first and second time by
unanimous consent, and considered by the Senate
as in Committee of the Whole.
