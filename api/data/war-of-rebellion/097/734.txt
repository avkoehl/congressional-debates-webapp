APPOMATTOX COURT-HOUSE, VA., April 13, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

The surrender of General Lee's army was finally completed to-day. We have paroled from 25,000 to 30,000 men. One hundred and forty-seven pieces artillery have been received, about 10,000 small-arms, and 71 flags. I received on the 11th a deputation from Lychburg, proposing the surrender of that place and asking for our protection. I started Turner's division and Mackenzie's calvary for that point yesterday morning. I have conversed with many of the surrendered officers and am satisfied that by announcing at once terms and a liberal, merciful policy on the part of the Government we can once more have a happy, united country. I believe all reasoning men on both sides recognize the facts that slavery is dead.

JNO. GIBBON,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

General Mackenzie occupied Lynchburg at 1.30 p. m. yesterday. He reports an immense quantity of public property there. Turner's division will be there to-day. I have directed him not to destroy the railroad stock, although he will not be able to bring it away on account of the bridges being broken.

Major-General MEADE:

From the state of the roads and the immense stores to be removed from Lynchburg, I shall probably be detained a weed longer at this point.
