sumed then positions, and again exchanged shots
in the wanner prescribed by the terms of meeting
Mr Graves fired first, before he had fully eleva-
ted his piece, Mr Cilley fired about two seconds
afterwards They both missed Mr Cilley could
not have reserved his fire had he been disposed to
do so Mr Jones, Mr Bynum, Mr Schaum-
burg, Doctor Poltz, Mr Wae, and Mr Fuller,
thought, from the motions and appearance of Mr
Graves, that he was hit He at once said, "I
must have another shot" Mr Wise says, "he
positively, peremptorily, and repeatedly insisted
upon another shot "
The seconds and friends again assembled, and
the challenge was agau^withdrawn Mr Jones
said, "Mr Wise, my fnela,in coming to the ground
and exchanging shots with Mr Graves, has shown
to the world that, in declining to receive the note
oí Colonel Webb, he did not do so because he
dreaded a controversy He has shown himself a
brave man, and disposed to render satisfaction to
Mr Graves I do think that he has done so, and
that the matter should end here " Mr Wise re-
plied, in substance "Mr Jones, Mr Cilley has al-
ready expressed his respect for Mr Graves, in the
wntten correspondence, and Mr Graves does not íe-
quire of Mr Cilley a cemficate of character tor
Colonel Webb, he considers himself bound not
only to preserve the respect due to himself, but to
defend the honor of his friend, Colonel Webb
Mr Graves only insists that he has not borne the
note of a man who is not a man of honor and not
a gentleman " The challenge was again renewed,
and while the friends were loading the rifles, Mr
Wise and Mr Jones w alked apart, and Mr Wise
asked Mr Jones "if Mr Cilley could not assign
the reason for declining to receive the note of Col
Webb, that he [Mr Cilley] did not hold himself
accountable to Colonel Webb ioi words spoken m
debate'" Mi Jones replied, that "Mr Cilley would
not assign that reason, because he did not wish to
be understood as expiossmg the op nion whether he
was or was not accountable for words spoken m
debate " Mr Wise then asked Mr Jones whether
"Mr Cilley would not say that, in declining to
receive the note of Colonel Webb, he meant no
disrespect to Mr Graves, either duecl'y or indi-
iecthji" To which Mr Jone° íeplied affirmative
ly, adding, "Mr Cilley entertains the highest re-
spect for Mr Graves, but declined to receive the
note because he chose to be drawn into no contro-
llers} with Colonel Webb " Mr Tones says tint
Mr Wise took no exception to this answer, but
continued to require other concessions, as stated,
to be made Mr Wise aa)s that in making (hit
proposition he went beyond his instructior-s, and
that the propsition and the response to it were not
communicated to Mr Graves, but were commu-
nicated both to Mr Cnttenden and to Mr Menefee
Mr Cnttenden sajs he dues not remember to have
heard ihun, not to hive heard of them, during the
p> ogress of the contest, and that he does net lemem-
ber to hive given any advice or opinion upon
them Mi Menefee lemembers thf proposition
and leply, and positively or by acquiescence gave
the advice that the reply, tlms qualified, was but a
reiteration, in substace, of the original ground as-
sumed by Mr Cilley, and held to be inadmissible
by Mi Graves Mr Wise had in his possession,
on the giound, three wntten piopositions, neither
of which was exhibited, nor their substance sub-
muted, in any other manner than as before stated
Mr Jones, Mr Bynum, Mr Schaumburg, Dr
Duncan, and Dr Follz, now objected, in the
strongest language, against the further prosecution
of the contest, and insisted that it should now cea«e,
and that Mr Graves should declare himself satis-
fied Mr Crittenden was understood again, by
nearly all present, to concur m these views, but it
appeals, from his testimony, that he acquiesced m
the views of Mr Wise and Mr Menefee They
insisted that the fight should go on, unless Mr Cil-
ley would make the concessions which were de-
manded, either a direct disclaimer of any personal
exception to James Watson Webb, as a gentleman
and a ¡nan of honor, in declining to receive nis
note, or an indirect disclaimer, by placing the re-
fusal to íeceive it upon the ground of privilege,
both of which Mr Cilley, m the correspondence
and throughout the affair upon the field, had re-
fused to do, and, peisistmg in it, had twice re-
ceived the fire of his antagonist
Immediately previous to the last exchange of
shots, Mr. Wise said to Mr Jones, " If this matter
is not terminated this shot, and is not settled, I will
propo&e to shorten the distance " To which Mr
Jones replied, " After this shot, without effect, I
will entertain the proposition " Mr Graves had di-
rected Mr Wise, if they missed repeatedly, to pre-
vent a prolongation of the affair by proposing
closer quarters, m conseqtence of which, Mr Wise
made the proposition, which would have aggrava-
ted the severity of the terms The rifles being
loaded, the parties resumed their stations, and fired
the third time, very nearly together Mr Cilley
was shot through the body He dropped his rifle,
beckoned to one near him, and said to him, " I am
shot," put both his hands to his wound, fell, and in
two or three minutes expired
Early m the day on which he fell, an agreement
was entered into between James Wafeon Webb,
Daniel Jackson, and William H Morell, to
arm themselves, repair to the room of Mr. Cilley,
and force him to fight Webb with pistols on the
spot, or to pledge his word of honor to give Webb
a meeting before Mr Graves, and, if Mr Cilley
would do npither, to shatter his right arm They
accordingly took measures to ascertain whether Mr
Cilley was at his lodgings, and finding that he was
not, they proceeded, well armed, to Bladensburg,
where it was said the duel between Mr Graves and
Mr Cilley was to take place. Before arriving there,
it was agreed between Webb, Jackson, and Mo-
rell, that Webb should approach Mr Cilley, claim
the quarrel, insist on fighting him, and assure him
that if he aimed his rifle at Mr Graves, he [Webb]
would shoot him [Mr Cilley] on the spot. It
was supposed by them that Mr Graves or Mr
Wise, or some ol the party, would raise a weapon
at Webb, whereupon it was agreed that Webb should
instantly sho >t Mr Cilley, and lhat they should then
defend them ehes m the best way they could
Not finding tha parties at Bladensburg, they fol-
lowed in pursuit to the old Magazine, and thence
to the shore of the Potomac, near the arsenal, at
Greenleaf's Point, whence, it being after 3 o'c ock,
p rn they returned to the city, to await the result
"It is unnecessary to add," say they, m a statement
drawn up by Webb, signed by Jackson and Mo-
rell, and published m the New York Couner ind
Enquirer "what would have been the course of
Col Webb, if Mr Graves, mstead of Mr Cilley,
had been injured Suffice it to say, that it was
sanctioned by us, and however much u e deplored
it, we could not doubt but the extraordinary posi-
tion m which he would have been placed would
have warranted the course determined upon " It
is difficult to imagine what is here darkly sha-
dowed forth, if it be not that, had Mr Cilley sui-
vived the encounter with Mr Graves, and had the
latter suflered in it, it would then have been the
fate of Mr Cilley to have encountered an a^assin
Such were the matenal facts and circumstances
which attended the death of Mi Cilley The
committee, entertaining the opinion that the cause
of the challenge was the cause < f the death of Mr
Cilley, have sought for it where it «hould be found
in the most authentic form, in the correspondtnee
of the parties
Mr Cilley declined to receive the note of Mr
Webb, because he "chose to be diawn into no
controversy with him " He placed his refusal to re-
ceive a demand for explanation of the words spoken
by him in debate solely on (he ground of his own
voluntary election, without assigning any other
reason "He chose to be drawn into no contro-
versy" with Webb He declared, at the same
time, that he neither affirmed nor denied any thing
in regard to Webb's character, in declining to re-
ceive the note He declared further, that he had
before stated, and now repeated, that he intended
b> the refusal no disrespect to Mr Graves, and
that he had said this only m reply to a remark of
Mr Graves, that this course might place htm in
an unpleasant situation
Mr Graves, ¡n his second note, takes'but one
exception to this first note of Mr Cilley " It does
not disclaim any exception to him (Webb) per-
sonally as a gentleman " He «ays " Your note
of yesterday, in reply to mine of that date, is inex-
plicit, unsatisfectory, and insufficient, among other
things in this—that, ifl your declining to receive
Colonel Webb's communication, it does not dis-
claim any exception to him, personally, as a gen-
tleman " " I have, therefore," he adds, " to
inquire whether you declined to receive his com-
munication on the ground of any personal excep-
tion to him as a gentleman or a man of honor 1
A categorical answer is expected "
Mr Cilley, m his second note, regrets that his
first was unsatisfactory, but cannot admit the right
of Mr Graves to propound the question, and,
therefore, he declines any further íesponse to it
It is difficult to conceive that Mr Graves, upon
this correspondence of Mr Cilley, could have
challenged him for inlendmz disrespect to Mr
Graves, for any such intention was positively dis-
claimed, and, as appears, in a most unexception-
able and courteous manner, m repl} to a suggestion
of his own, which called for it, oi for affirming or
denying any thing tk regaid io the charactei of Webb,
in declining to receive his note, for any such
affirmation or denial is also disclaimed, m equally
positive terms Mr Cilley had declined to receive
a call from James Watson Webb, for explana-
tion of words spoken in debate in the Hou¿>e of Re-
presentatives, and had put his refusal solely on the
ground that he chose to be drawn into no controver-
sy with him, but he is pressed furthei, and interro-
gated beyond this limit, which he had assigned to
himself, and a categorical answer is demanded to
the question whether he declined on the ground ot
any personal exception to Webb as a gentleman or
a man of honor He denies the i in,m to interro-
gate him in this manner for declining a call, which
his right, and duty, as a memb«r of the House oí
Representatives, and the ju^t maintenance of the
privileges of that body, required him u decline, and,
denying the light to i itrrrogatc, h , therefore, re-
fused to submit to ansvu anyfurtfc Anditwas
because he refused so leieive the note, and íefused
to answei anv n itler, that he was challerged by
another member of the same bod
This matter is not left cpen U inference or argu-
ment The cause of the challen0e appears in a
manner which pr i' ' silld ubrt It instill further
specified and avowed by Mr Graves himself, in his
own note, which contains the challenge It is
stated clearly, unequivocally, and with the utmost
precision, and is assigned expressly, and in form,
as the cause for which the challenge is given ".is
you have declined accepting a communication which
I bore to you fiom Colonel Webb, and as by
your note of yesteiday you have refused to decline
on grounds which wou'd eaconti ale me from all
) esponsibihty growing out of the affair, I am
left no othei alternative but to ask tliat satisfac-
tion which is recognis d among g entlemen " Mr
Cilley, hv his "note of yesteiday,'" hid refused
to answei the question to which a "categoi ical
ansa c?" had b en demanded that js to sav, "trhetfiei
he declined to receive Colonel Webbs commvnica-
hon on the ground of any peisonal exception lo
him as a gentleman or man of honm " The ground
of challenge, therefore, is, by Mr Grives him-
self, expiessly stated to be, that Mr Cilley de-
clined lo i eceive the communication from Webb, and,
by his note of February 221, refused lo aniwer that
question, touching the honor of Webb This vv as the
open and avowed cause,set forth and presented to
Mr Cilley, by which he was guided, and upon
which he acted, m a miner involv mg the utmost
extremity of human responsibility For this cause,
and foi this alone, he was challenged an 1 fell b>
the hand of Mr Graves, unless it be admissible to
believe that, after all verbal communication had
ctased between him and his antagonist, and the
difference had assumed the form exclusively of a
written correspondence between them, he was
challenged and fell for a cause not set up m that
coirespondence, not put forth as a ground of
complaint, not made known to him or his friends
as a matter of grievance, and in regard to which,
therefore, it may be believed, he was profoundly
ignorant, and had no opportunity afio.ded him in
any way of voluntary satisfaction or explanation
Nor is there  any thing   in  what subsequently
