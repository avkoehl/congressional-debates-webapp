Mr. POMEROY. The words " postal cards"

way through without specifying them in each
^Xhe PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Cole
in the chair.) That will be done if there be
no objection.

Mr. SPENCER. I move to amend that
section by adding the words:
Provided, however. That in no case shall the Uni-
ted States be considered as liable for the loss of
money so transmitted by mail. Any such loss shall
fall on the person to or from whom the same is
transmitted.
Mr. RAMSEY. It is usual to let the com-
mittee go through with their amendments first.
Mr. SPENCER. I hope tlie chairman will
accept the amendment.
Mr. POMEROY. I think it is a good
amendment; but you ought not to charge the
loss to the party to whom the thing is sent.,
but to the party sending it.
Mr. SPENCER. If the Senator will listen
to the reading of the amendment I think he
will be satisfied.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques
tion is on the amendment to the amendment
proposed by the Senator from Alabama.
Mr. RAMSEY. I should like to reserve
the question for action in the Senate.
Mr. POMEROY. Let it be acted on, and
the amendment can be reserved in the Senate
for a separate vote.
Mr. SPENCER. I do not understand the
system of reserving. It goes into the Senate
necessarily.
Mr. RAMSEY. Then it is all the same.
Mr. SPENCER. I hope advantage will not
be taken of my absence when the bill is re-
ported.
