HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 11, 1864.

General J. C. DAVIS, Commanding Fourteenth Corps:

GENERAL: The report of Lieutenant-Colonel Morgan, Seventy-fourth Indiana Volunteers, has been received*. I am instructed by General Sherman to direct you to let the man Berry Houk return home, with written instructions that he must take good care of the wounded soldier now at his house, and when he has sufficiently recovered to deliver him at any U. S. military post, for which he shall receive pay for each day's care at the of seventy-five cents in gold. The other men arrested you will send under good guard to Chattanooga, to be imprisoned and held as hostages for the return of the wounded soldier at Houk's house, and 31 of our soldiers whom they admit having unlawfully captured and made prisoners. The man Hendricks to be kept in confinement being a possibility of escape during the war. An extract of so much of these instructions as refers to Mr. Houk you will furnish him as a voucher, to be recognized by our officers when he returns the wounded man. You will also send a full copy with the guard, to be given to the commanding officer at Chattanooga when the squad delivers the prisoners. I would further state that the wounded soldier of our guard brought in by Houk is now in Chattanooga hospital, sent there in care of Surgeon Wright, who had charge of the hospital at Kingston. From this man evidence might be had which would implicate some of these prisoners to a greater degree than the citizen hostages.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
