Kentucky and the States north of it have been made into a separate department and General Wright assigned to the command. This does not affect Tennessee or your army operating in that State and against Chattanooga, but includes all troops now in Kentucky. You, however, will continue the general direction of affairs in that State till General Wright arrives and assumes command. He will first visit the Governors of Ohio, Indiana, and Illinois to consult about raising troops.
