James River and Kanawha Canal—Mr. Terry.
42d Cong....3d Sesb.
they have to encounter and overcome the op-
position of ignorance and prejudice. The
James River and Kanawha canal was not,.an
exception to this rule, and hence the charter
to construct this work was not granted by the
Legislature of Virginia until the year 1832,
and il was not commenced until 1836. It has
been completed from Richmond to Buchanan,
a distance of one hundred and Diuety-seven
miles, at a cost of $10,436,869, and consider-
able work has been done between Buchanan,
the present terminus, and Covington, a dis-
tance of forty-seven miles.
This canal, as originally designed, was to
be five feet deep, thirty feet wide at, the bottom
and fifty at the water line, with locks one hun-
dred feet by fifteen in the clear. At the time
of the charter of this canal, and when these
dimensions were determined upon, the popula-
tion of the great northwestern States that
would naturally seek an outlet through this
channel did not exceed some 3,000,000, and
the cereal production was only some 150,000,000
bushels. But civilization has gone westward ;
States have sprung up from what was called
in the geographies of the day " the unexplored
region," and the population in 1870 had in-
creased fivefold and the production of grain
to a still greater ratio. To meet the increasing
demands of trade, it is now proposed to enlarge
the present canal and construct the remainder
to the Greenbrier river seventy feet wide at the
water line with a depth of seven feet, and the
locks one hundred and twenty by twenty feet.
The rapid increase of both population and pro-
duction renders additional facilities for trade
an imperative necessity.
The area of the West particularly interested
in the enlargement and completion of the
James River and Kanawha canal embraces
the following populous' and growing States :

In 1800 these States and Territories had a
population of 11,045,507, and they have in-
creased 4,654,910 in 1870. And when it is
remembered that in 1810 the northwestern
States produced 218,403,583 bushels of grain,
in 1860 the production was 042,120,306, and
in 1870 about 1,000,000,000 bushels, and that
the grain-growing States west of thelakeshad
in cultivation in 1850 only about 26,000,000
acres; in 1860, 52,519,000; and in 1870, 85,-
669,787 acres, no fears need be entertained
that all the outlets of trade which have been
made or which are now in contemplation will
not command tonnage to their utmost capacity.
Wonderful as has been the increase of the West
in both population and production, we have
every reason to expect a simitar increase for
generations to'come. In the language ot the
Superintendent of the Census—
" The only fear is that we will not keep pace with
increased production by the provision ol increased
facilities of transportation."
The necessity of providing additional trans-
portation being conceded, the next question
for consideration is whether it shall be canals
or railroads, according to the practicability of
either. Some years ago the advocates of rail-
roads maintained that the era of canals had
passed, and that railroads alone could meet
the demands of trade and the active and enter-
prising spirit, of the age. But more correct
views have takeu the place of such theories,
and experience shows that canals and railroads
should not be regarded iu the light of trade
rivals for public favor ; each has its appropri-
ate sphere of especial usefulness, and they are
in fact counterparts and essentials to a com-
plete, effective, and judicious system of in-
ternal improvement. When the freights are
light or perishable aud expedition is re-
quired, railroads will command the trade ; but
where the freights are heavy, where the mate-
rials are crude and cheap, they will naturally
and from necessity, seek the cheap transporta-
tion afforded by canals.
And the practical working of canals and
railroads shows that in many instances, where
these improvements were side by side, the
most satisfactory results have followed. The
Erie canal and Central railroad in New York
are striking instances of this fact. Trade hav-
ing a choice of routes, that route is sought,
which is peculiarly adapted to the kind of
freight, and the advantage of each system
would naturally be the result. Railroads re-
lieved of heavy and cheap freights, would at
the same time be saved the wear aud tear to
track and rolling-stock necessarily incident to
such transportation.
I do not propose to go more than incident-
ally into the question of the superiority of
canals over railroads for the transportation of
heavy freights, but by a few examples to show
that the great grain-growing States of the
Northwest, notwithstanding they have many
outlets by rail, are now to a large extent cut
off from the eastern markets for the sale of
their surplus grain by reason of th£ high charges
of transportation. The charge for freight
from Dubuque to New York by rail is so high
that it amounts to a prohibition; and even
from Illinois and Indiana corn will scarcely bear
transportation. The average rate of freight
in mills per ton per mile, according to Pro-
fessor Maury, by rail and water may therefore
be stated as follows:
By sea. (long voyage)  1.5
Coabt-wise  4.8
River, (baraes)  4
Erie canal, (.including tolls)...... ;  9.6
James River and ICanawha canal, (without
tolls)  5.
Canals generally 13.7
Railways 30
Hence we see that the average freight by
rail over the James River aud Kanawha canal
is as six to one, aud over canals generally more
than two to one.
The estimate of freight on the James River
and Kanawha canal, of five mills per ton per
inile, without tolls, must be increased $1 94
per ton, or five and a half cents per bushel on
grain, should the work fall into the hands of
individuals instead of being completed by the
Government. If it be conceded that for heavy
freights canals are cheaper than railroads, then
the only remaining questions worthy of consid-
eration are, first, which improvement is the
most practicable, considering the route; sec-
ond, which the shorter route between those
points of trade which are sought to be brought
into communication. Connecting the West
and Bast there are three lines of communica-
tion, in whole or iu part water transportation ;
namely, by the lakes and the St. Lawrence, by
the lakes and Erie canal, and by the Missis-
sippi river and Gulf. A brief comparison of
the distances on these routes will show that
the difference is in favor of the Virginia line.
But as there can be no competition between
the St. Lawrence route and the Virginia water
line, the comparison will be confined to the
Erie and Mississippi routes. The following
table will show the relative distances by these
water lines:

Thus it appears that all the great centers of
trade find their shortest line to the seaboard
at Norfolk, or even to New York, by way of
Norfolk. A few data, taken from the able
report of Mr. Edward Lorraine, United States
engineer iu charge of the survey of the James
River and Kanawha canal, and chief engineer
of the same, will clearly show the economy of
this route:
From Dubuque by the Virginia line to
Hampton Koads, 1,077 miles ; charges per ton,
$6 52. From Dubuque to New York, via
Chicago, the lakes, and Krie canal, 1,731
miles; charges per ton, $6 88. Difference in
charges in favor of Virginia route, thirty-six
cents, while t,he difference in distance is two
hundred and forty-six miles in favor of the
route to New York.
From Dubuque to New York via Toledo,
the lakes, and Erie canal, 1,185 miles ; charges
per ton, $9 22. Difference in favor of Vir-
ginia line of $2 70 per ton, but the difference
against, Virginia line in distance is 792 miles.
From Dubuque to New York by the Missis-
sippi river and ocean, 3,515 miles ; charges per
ton, $7 86; difference in favor of Virginia line
$1 34 per ton, and distance 1,538 miles. From
St. Louis to Hampton Roads by Virginia water
line, 1,513 miles, and charges per ton $5 13.
From St. Louis to New York via Illinois and
Michigan canal, lakes, and Erie canal, 1,960
miles, and charges $5 89 per ton; difference
in charge in favor of Virginia line 76 cents per
ton, and iu distance, 447 miles.
From St. Louis to New York, by Portsmouth,
Ohio, and Erie canals, 1,813 miles; charges per
ton, $6 70 ; difference in favor of Virginia
lines $1 57 per ton and in distance 300 miles.
From Cincinnati to New York, by the Mi-
ami canal, lake, aud Erie canal, 1,019 miles,
and charges per ton, $4 07.
From Cincinnati to Hampton Roads, by the
Virginia line, 816 miles, and charges per ton,
S3 04; difference in favor of Virginia water
line, $1 03 per ton, and in distance 203 miles.
From St. Louis to Liverpool by the Missis-
sippi river, 6,529 miles, and charges per ton,
$11 09, while by the Virginia line it is 5,223
miles, and charges per ton $10 79; in favor
of Virginia line, 90 cents per ton, and distance
1,306 miles.
Examples might be multiplied, butthese are
sufficient to show the advantages of the Vir-
ginia water line over nearly all competing
lines in distance, and over all in cheapness of
transportation.
The Virginia line possesses one advantage
over the northern water lines which is very
decided. These northern lines are closed by
ice about five months in each year; here is
a direct loss of five twelfths of the trade ca-
pacity of these lines ; whereas the Virginia
line is not closed by ice one month in the year
upon an average. According to the reports
