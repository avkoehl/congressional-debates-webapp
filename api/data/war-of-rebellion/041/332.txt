My won personal staff, Lieutenant [E. R.] Wells, acting assistant adjutant general; Captain [C. B.] Sheppard, aide-de-camp; Captains Calvitt and [Leander] McAnelly, volunteer aides-de-camp, were active and efficient and rendered me excellent service.

The gallant dead have proven their devotion to our cause, and the wounded in their silent sufferings have shown that fortitude which a good cause alone could have endued them with.

Notwithstanding the severe march, the troops are ready and anxious to again meet them invader upon our soil.

Below I respectfully submit a statement of the losses sustained in the action.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS GREEN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major LOUIS BUSH,

Asst. Adjt. General, Sub-District Southwestern Louisiana.
