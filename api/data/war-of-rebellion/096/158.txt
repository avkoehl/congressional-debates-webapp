CITY POINT, VA., January 17, 1865.

President A. LINCOLN:

From the Richmond papers of to-day I learn that on yesterday Judge Halliburton, of the Confederate court of the Eastern District of Virginia, issued a writ of has corpus, on the petition of Governor Foote, returnable on Thursday next. It is supposed by the papers, however, that this matter was settled yesterday by the Confederate House of representative declaring that they "are of opinion that the good of the country would not be subserved by the force attendance of said member upon the sessions of this House, but that under all the circumstances of the case it is expedient that the military authorities discharge him from custody." It is presumed that Mr. Foote has already been placed at liberty.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 17, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

As a substantial recognition of the bravery of both officers and men in the capture of Fort Firsher, and the important service thereby rendered their country, I do not respectfully recommend Bvt. Major General Alfred H. Terry, U. S. Volunteers, their commanding officer, for appointments as brigadier-general in the Regular Army.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 17, 1865.

Hon E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The following official dispatch from bvt. Major General A. H. Terry, commanding the land forces operating against Fort Fisher, announcing its capture by the united valor of the army and navy, is just received.* I have ordered a salute of 100 guns to be fired by each army here in honor of their great triumph.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, January 17, 1865 - 8.10 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point:

Mr. F. P. Blair, sr., will go immediately to Richmond. Will you be good enough to telegraph me when he can go through by water, if possible, so there shall be no delay. He is too old to endure the fatigue of a land march and delay. I congratulate you upon the Federal Point affair.

G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy.
