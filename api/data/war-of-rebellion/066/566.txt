CHARLESTON, S. C., July 7, 1864.

His Excellency Governor BONHAM,

Columbia:

SIR: In the present threatening aspect of affairs around Charleston it is extremely desirable that I should have every soldier in the front. I write, therefore, to ask you whether you will send me the cadets of the State Academy in Columbia to do duty in this city. They would relieve several guards of able-bodied men, and be of great assistance at this time. I do not propose to put them in conflict with the enemy unless as a dernier resort.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
