APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
26th Cong....2nd ¡*ess.
Pre. emotion Law—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
people have chosen to be their successors, are leav-
ing every thing topsyturvy, and in a stale of the
utmost confusion, dilapidation and decay The
financial effect of this bill will be to dimmish the
current expenses of the year by every pre-emption
that shall be sold; and I here I predict that the
greatest amount derived next year from the pub-
lic lands will be from sales to pre-emptioners, and,
as they have a year's credit, the money will not
come into the Treasury till the year following
But I have b°en drawn aside from that which
tempted me to trouble the Senate on the present
occasion I mtreat gentlemen to forbear, and to
give a fixed limitation to the operalion of their
bill, and not send forth, with a census yet untold,
and with elect members on Congress not in their
dlaces, a measure which may operate most wjiiri
ously, and which, if it shall operate well, will
without doubt, be con'mued.
Mr. CLAY of Alabama, said he should not now
attempt any reply to what had been said by the
Senator from Kentucky, on the subject of the
Treasury notes He had risen to correct the Se-
natonn-an important matter of fact That gentle
man had said that the practical operation of the
bill would be to deprive the new States of the be-
nefit derived from the reservation of the sixteenth
section in every township for purposes of educa-
tion Mr C regretted that the memory of the
honerable Senator should be so conveniently short
in reference to the provisions ot this bill The sub
ject of these reserved sections had been adverted
to, the objeción had been brought forward, and
Mr. C had, in consequence, offered an amendment
declaring that, if a pre-emption was found to in-
terfere with a sixteenth se tion, it should be re-
moved, and that section left untouched. Did not
every one know that, by the law which was the
foundation of our land system, these sixteenth sec-
tions were to be reserves!'? And were they not ex-
cepted by the bil' And yet the Senatoi tould
rise and tell the Senate that the effect of the bill
would be to take away the land reserved for com
mon schools.
As to the clearness of the language emplo>ed by
the Secretary of the Treasary on the subject of the
revenue, Mr C could not perceive that it had any
very intimate connection with the present bill
Nor could he perceive the necessity of going aside
to make an attack on a distinguished individual
now retired from public life, but who, like some
evil genms, seemed to be ever present to ihe mind
of that honorable Senator And wny' Had not
the Senator told the Senate that after the 4th of
March his political friends would have the posses-
sion of power, not only m the Executive, but in
both branches of the Legislature? And suppose the
bill should be ever so injurious, would they be
atraid to repeal n' That would be a question for
them to consider But if they chose to do it, they
would certainly have the power. The Senator had
said that this bill was to be irrevocable, and to pre
vent this he argued for its limitation Now one of
the first lessons Mr. C had learned in the study of
Blackstone bad been, that one Parliament pos-
sessed no power to control and bind a subsequent
Parliament How then could the law be irrevoca-
ble'2 Might it not be repealed as soon as that gen-
tleman and his fuends got into power But that
Senator eould see nothing good in the bill, and had
in fact been a' war with that section of the coun-
try from which Mr. C came ever since he had
enjoyed the honor of a seat on that floor It must
be perfectly obvious that there was no force in the
objection of the Senator in regard to the sixteenth
section That section was not in the least danger,
if it were Mr C would be the last man to vote for
the bill
Mr PORTER said that, from the looseness of
the requirements contained in this bill, as to occu-
pancy and settlement, the pre emption right would
be open to abuses wh ch would operate greatly to
the injury of the class for whose benefit it pur-
ported to be framed, and he feared, too, to the in-
jury of the State he represented
This bill has been truly stated to be, m effect,
the grantmg of a credit to one class of land pur-
chasers, and although this credit, in respect to sur
veyed lands subject to entry, can in no case exceed
one year, and in some cases it may be less, yet it
is not so as to lands unsurveyed The occupant of
them may assert his pre emptive ngbt at any time
before they --hall be proclaimed for sale Now,
under the provisions of this bill, w'iat constitutes
a settlement' Simply, the inhabiting, the building
of a log cabin, and the improving No continuity
of occupancy is required, and these evidencts of an
intention to make a settlement may be of the most
trifling character, affording no ground for the be
lief that a permanent occupancy is contem
plated Where the settlement is on lands subject
to entry, I admit there is no motive to this system of
sham location, for, in that case, the purchase mo
ney must, m general, be paid w thin a year But,
in respect to land*; unsurveyed, ann which are not
subject to entry, the obligation is different, and this
difference muy be illustrated by a -eference to the
fact that, in some instances, the Indian title to
lands has bc?n extinguished from four to five
years before they have been surveyed or brought
into market A crtdit, in the form of a pre-emp-
tive right, might then be acquired to these lands for
that length of time It is not of this length of cre-
dit to an actual setller on the public lands that I am
disposed to complain—and were this bill so guard-
ed m it? provisions as to 1 rut its benefits to him
only, I should be content at once to wi hdraw this
amendment, for I am willing to give hvn even this
extended credit, but I fear it is not so guarded, and
my aim is to protect hi n from a system of fore-
stalling, which, under the general and loese terms
of "inhabiting," "log cabin," and "improving,"
may be successfully practised against Inm by the
mere specula or
By the treaty of Washington with the Ottawas
and Chippewas, in March, 1836, ihr Indian title
was extinguished (o from twelve to fitteen m lhon1*
of acres m the ttvo p<=mn uhs of Mich g<nn
Nearlv one-half of this is yet unsurveyed, and has,
of course, at no time, been sui jeet to entry Sup-
pose the bill now befuethe Senate had then been
the law of the land Under \<s Keeie log cabin
requirement, as to settlement, hundreds of per-
sons, having no intention wiatever to be-
come actual s ttlers, m gnt at once have se
cured their pre emptive nghis'there, which would
have endured to th s d ty And how' Merely
by each of them erecting on his location a m se.
rabie hovel, sleeping one night an! boiling his
pot in it, an*', to complete the mockery, by grub-
bing away a few bushes around it and throwing
down a handful of turnip seed, *o that he might
swear to an "improvement " This having been
done, and on the site, too, perhaps, of a magnifi-
cent water p >wrr, of incalculable value when pro-
perly improved, the pre emptive ngnt, under such
a law as this, would have been acquired The hut
would have been abandoned to rot in the wilder-
ness until the land should be surveyed and brought
into maik«t Meantime, tüf location has been
withdiawn from the reach '( the honest pre-
emptioner—the real pioneel, vhose lab jrs in the
making of permanent an I used 1 improvements
would have ?dded valae to contiguous lands and
induced their settlement and cultivation by hardy
adventurers like himself
Tnat this will be the practical operat on of this
pre empt on bill, shon d it lecome a law, I very
much fear The pre-emptive right will not be re-
stricted to that meritorious cla's fur wl.oui I be-
lieve it to bs eur imperative duty to provide, unless
some provision like this I have proposed shall be
(doptel in respect to lands not surveyed—unless
lome reasonao e duration of residence is required
as an earnest of the intention to make a settlement
n such land0.
Should this amendment be rejected, however, I
shall still vote for tne bill, because oí the general
benefits it will confer on the State I in part repie-
sent, under the hope that, shou d the evils I appse
bend be found to exist in practice, they may hereaf-
ter be remedied
Mr BUCHANAN said his opinion mr gardto
the existing land system of the country was, that
it was based on the soundest pr ncples of wisdom
and of policy He was as much attached to that
system, and as much disposed to adhere to it with
unshaken fidelity, as the Ssnator from Kentucky
himself, [Mr Ci,at,] He was in favor of no new
experiments up n it, for the experience of half a
ceotur> had proved that no wiser or better plan
could be devised by human ingenuity But, while
these were his conscientious coavicuons, he was,
neverthele s, of opinion that the Senator from
Kentucky was alarmed at spectres. Mr. B. had
witnessed with adaiiration the gigantic efforts of
that gentleman against pre emption at former ses-
sion , and yet he had never begun to fear, nor did
he now indulge the slightest feeling of alarm
in regard to this subject. I think (said Mr. B )
that the time has now arrived when the pre-
emption principle may, with the utmost safety,
and with perfect justice, be engrafted on our ex-
cellent system for the management of the public do-
mam Does the introduction of that principle vary,
in the lea^t degree, any material portion of that
system' Nor at all Does it go to reduce the
price of the land' Not, 'at the utmost, more than
than three or four cents an acre. What is its na-
ture? Gentleman should take an extended view
of the whole subject betore they made up an opi-
mon n regard to its merits. We own a vast
wilderness of unsettled lands subject to sale, and at
times there have been attempts on the part of
speculators to monopolize it fortunately, however,
they have never yet succeeded No fortunes have
been realized in this way, so far as I have heard.
In this state oí things, is it not our duty, our in-
terest, and our truest policy to encourage the set-
tlement of rhe new Statps in the West by a hardy,
industrious, and moral population"! And in what
does this pre-ernp'ion system trench upon, or in
the least m'srfere with the established land system
of the country' It only allows thepoor man, who
wishes to establish h mself in a permanent home,
to buy for himself a quarter section of land at the
full Goveinm nt price There is the whole of it.
In considerat on of the expediency and desirable-
ness of filling up this new country wnh a hardy,
and actne, and enterprising race of settlers, we
do—what' Gtve them the public land? No, but
first receive from them for it a dollar atad a quarter
an acre, and then convey it ts them m perpetuity.
The difference in the receipts at the Treasury from
what would be obtained for the same land at an
auction sale has never been estimated higher by any
peison than six cents an acre, and if it amounted to
that, and even more, m an enlarged view of the
bearings of ihe entire subject, this consideration
presents no objection in my mind. There are such
vast qnantities of land, and such a wide and ample
choice, tnat the speculator will never be obliged to
give much more than the Government price. And
as to all the lands taken up by pre-emption rights,
theyaie, when compared to our entire domain, but
as a drop in the ocean Such, at least, has been our
past experience Heretofore, we hare been very
cautious to pass none bjt limited pre-emption bills,
and we have wisely determined to put down for-
ever the practice of granting what are called
"floats," which was certainly productive of many
and gre-tt frauds We have confined the extent of
the pre-emption grant to a single quarter section of
160 acres of land, and it is now proposed to make
this right of pre-emption prospective and perpe-
tual The amendment of the Senator trom Ken-
tucky [Mr Crittenden] proposes to extend it in
rs ard to every man whose property does not ex-
ceed $1 000, not merely to 1 CO, but to 320 acres of
land And I now venture to predict that, when
the long proposed distribution bill of the Senator
from Kenluctiy, [Mr Clay,] shall become a law,
(and I presuma that day is not far distant,) there
will be incorporated into it a provision giantmg to
ihe actual honajHe settler a pre emption right to at
least 160 acres Even in bis own bill of 1839, un-
Ks my memory fail me, and if it does he wi 1 cor-
rect me, there was a provision in favor of pre emp-
tion I repeat that, while I am m favor of the set-
tled land system, such as it now exists, pre-emption
has ro terrors for me.
The honorable Senator has thought proper to say
something of the "wild, reckless, and ruinous le-
gislation" which prevailed under the Admimstra-
uon of General Jackson, and informed us that,
during that period in our history, the sessions of
Congress were protracted to an unusual length.   I
