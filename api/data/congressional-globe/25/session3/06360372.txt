Ho. of Reps.
Mr Chairman, let us now, for a few moments,
examine the opinions of Mr Taney, the Secre-,
tary of the Trea&urv, and the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means, {Mr Pot-K,] and
see it they thought bardes were monopolies, cal-
culated to destioy the hbeities" of the country
The following is an extract fiom Mi Taney's
report of 1834-35, indorsed by Mr Polk, chair-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means:
" It will be seen from this statement that H is no pirt of
the proposed plan to dispense witli tile State banks    It ob
viausly is not n tile power of Congress (it it desued to do
so) to take any measure for that purpose without ail amend
mentof the Constitution, and the States would not, and
ought not to surrender the power ol chartering banking
companies  The state banks art now so numerous and are
bo intimately connected with our habits and pursuit", tint
H «urn-possible to suppose tint the system can ever be en
tirely abandoned, nor is il desirable that it should be   They
are often abused, like other human institutions, yet their
advantages are many, and, under proper regulations, and
with the metatlic basis now proposed for tiieir paper issues,
they will be found of much public advantage   If there wera
no State banks, tire profitable busim ss ol banking and ex
change would be monopolized by the great capitalists "
Again, he says.
" They are convenient and useful for the purposes of
commerce This cannot be obtained without the aid of
paper circulation founded on credit "
This does not look as if banks were considered
dangerous at one stage of the political game tliat
has been played off upon the Ameitcan people I
will pass on to Mr. Speaker Polk's testimony.
The following extracts are taken from his speech
delivered in the House of Representatives duung
the session of 1834-35
«Through the agency of State banks, the fiscal opera-
tions ol Government have, during the pant yt ar, been eim
nently successful "
Again, he says.
" It is now no longer a question of doubt whether they
[State hanks] can, with facility and promptness, transfer
the public funds to the most dislnnt parts for disbursement,
and perform all other duties which, as fiscal agents, they
may be required to perform "
Alas, how changed are the views of this gen-
tleman and the party to which he belong 1 It is
now all wrong, they have not the constitutional
Íiowei to take paper money in payment of the pub-
ic dues, or to make banks the fiscal agents of the
Government, thereby virtually declaring that they,
through ignorance or corruption, I care not which,
have been exercising a power not delegated by
the Constitution Consistency, thou ai t a jewel'
The same party now turn up the whites of their
eyes with holy lion or at the idea of the dear, dear
people's money being used by banks, notwith
standing it is notouous that they encouiaged, ex
tended, and enlarged the practice of discounting
freely upon the public deposits In fact, the Sec-
retary of the Treasury oideied the deposit banks
to discount to the met chants freely Now it is a
am of the most damning natuie Yes, sit, banks
are pronounced to be the enemy of the laboung
classes, attempts are being mado to set up one
portion of the community against another, by
drawing distinctions in society, and by inflated ap-
peals to the vulgar passions and prejudices of our
nature
Sir, never, never do I witness an appeal of the
kind, come fiom what quartet it may, but it se-
cures to the utterer my supreme and ineffable
contempt My mind is instantly earned to other
countries and other scenes, there is piesented to
my view revolutionary France, and I behold a
Marat, a Danton, and a Robespierre, weltering
in human goie, riding over the prostrate íehgion
ol their country and all of its hallowed itistitu
tions, yet all the time shouting hosannas to the
people, and boasting that the mind of man was
on its onward march to fieedom, and that the
spirit of the age was bursting asunder the bonds
of priestcraft, and that they were erecting upon
the throne of reason the only true religion, until,
finally, they fell victims to their own damning
doctrines, and left their country and their coun-
try'shberty an easy conquest to the military genius
of a Bonaparte Compare the equalizing and
mobocratic doctrines of the day with the doctrines
just alluded to, and you will be astonished to find
how well they agree What do we hear now ?
That banks are behind the spirit of the age, that
the mind of man is on its onward march to free-
dom, and that we are about to burst from around
us bank shackles, and, in the language of another,
"walk forth redeemed, regenerated, and disen-
tlnaltód, through the irresistible genius" of the
free banking aje. Sir, such sentiments as these
ptoduce a die id uprn my mind that possibly the
day is not far distant when similar blood-statncd
scenes may be enacted ovet in this yet fiee coun-
try, and all in the name of the much-abused
woids of "liberty" and "democracy " I, for
one, look upon the banking system (well regu-
lated) as a blessing given to us, founded upon the
past cxpeuence of mankind, as a system more
secure and safe than puvate banking companies,
and as a shield and protectoi to those who have
but little means against those who have an abun-
dance of means. But all must now be abandoned
for the sub Treasury scheme, even at the expense
of a political somerset, What is this rnuch-taiked-
of sub-Treasui y bill ? It is simply to substitute
individuals in the place of banks as the fiscal
agents of the Government I propose to adopt
as my own Mr Polk's speech, delivered at the
session of 1834-35, against this change It is an
excellent argument, I cannot better it, but let it
speak for itsell
* Itiat amendment provides that the collectors of the
public revenue shall be tin agent  of the Treasurer to keep
and disburse the same, and tint they shall rect ive an in
niial compensation (or their services J he Secretary in
his report has not overlooked the discripnon ol perstmul

the Slates and the United States should both deem it

as fiscal agent* , except by the employment in their pi ice of
other and individual ugeutswho will probably be found less
responsible, safe, convenient or economical ' A coipora

sponsible he mav lie, because it consists of an as oention

service which individuals, to the extent ot our revenue,
could not pi rform
It miy happen, in the fluctuation of the amount of rev
cnue and expi n litun s that there will be at some tunes a
surplus in the Inisiirv winch, though it maybe tempo
rary, if it be withdrawn from cu dilution, and pi iced in the
strong box of a receiver the amount of circulation will be
uijuiiousty disturbed b) hoarding the deposit, by which the
value of every article ol inerthandise and property would
be affected So that, inasmuch as we cannot nnti ipate or
estimate what the exict amount of revenue or expenditure
may be from year to vear, thero may occur an excess in the
i rcasury not immediately called lor to be disbursi d which
it would be vi ry inconvenient to abstract from trade and
circuí ition Whilst ihedipo«u is in bank, the bink may
use it keeping itself readv, at the same time, to pay when
demanded, and it is not withdrawn from general circulan  n,
as so much money hoarded, and drawn Irom the use of the
community If in the hinds of a receiver, thev may either
hoard it by keeping it locked up m a strong box, or use it,
at their own risk, in private speculation or trade or they
must, for their on n security, and on their own responsilnl
uy, place it at last on deposit in the b inks for safe keeping
until they are called upon by the Government for it This
temporary use of the money on deposit m banks constitutes
the only compensation which the bank receives for the
n k of keeping it, and for the services it performs. If re
ceivers be employed, they can perform no other service than
to keep the money, am) must be paid a compensation from
the J reasury "
Mr Chairman, to my mind this is a very con-
clusive argument. The gentleman must surely
have had, at the time of its delivery, misgivings.
as to Swartwout*s and Price's recent failure, at
all events, it was pointed out in hrs remarks with
amazing accuracy Sir, it must be admitted by
all thitt this new scheme of finance will increase*
the Executive patronage Still it is asked fo in
the name of Itbeity and Democracy, and the
party that oppose it are dubbed " Federalists "
The object of the framers of the Constitution had
been to create between the various pot tions of oui
political system a -just balance of power, and for
this purpose they had placed the Executive as a
balance-wheel to íegulate the movements of all
the rest of tire machine; btitit was obvious that,
if too much power was thrown upon the balance-
wheel, it must accelerate the motion of the other
parts in an undue .and destructive degree Yet
the modern Damocrats are clamorous for this in-
crease of power
Mr Chairman, independent of that view of the
subject, I wish to ask the eommittee a plain com*
mon-sense question, which gees to the vitals of
this sub-Treasury ptopjet In the transaction of
men's daily business, do they deposit their money
in non safas, or do they deposit it in banks' If
every business man in the country prefers bank 
as the safest and the best, why should not the
same reason apply to the money of the Govern-
ment? Is the interest of the Government differ-
ent fiom that of individuals, when the question?
of safi ty is the only one invohed in the ttansac-
tion > Theie can be no reason foi applying a dif-
feient íule. All the Government and all the in-
dividuals want to arrive at, is the safe keeping of
their money It is the duty of the General Gov-
ernment to accommodate its action to the action of
the diffeient State governments The States use
banks as fiscal aeents, and receive bank paper in
payment of public dues If the General Govern-
ment should be so conducted as to move on re-
gatdless of the action of the States, the inevitable
result must be a jarring in the machine, and, if it
continues, it must end in general confusion and
anaichy I had marked m my notes Senate doc-
ument No 88, and had noted eeveial poi tions of it
to be lead, but 1 will not detain the committee It
is the celebrated reform and reticnchment leport
of the Senate of the United States, made in 1828
I will read but one of the extiacts The writer,
aftei having portiayed in vivid colors the dangers
to be appiehended fiom Lxecutive patronage,
continues by rematking
" That tin whole of this great power will center in the
President Tin King ot England is the fountain ot honor ,
the President of the United States the souice of patronage
He presides over the entiie svsti in of jobs and contracts
He has power over the support of the individuals who ait
minister the s>ptein, he makts and unmakes them, ho
chooses from the circle of his friends and supporters, and
mav dismiss them , and, upon all the principles of human
actit n, will dismiss them as often is th-y disipp nut his ex
pectations His spirit will animate their actions ill ill the
elections to Sute and I ederal ornees Amin we must
then look forward to the tune when the public revenue will
be doubled, whin the civil and military ofheers will be
quadrupled when its influence ovi r individuals will be
multiplied to an indefinite extent, when the nomination of
the Presidí nt can carry any man thn uc,h th( faénate, and
his recommendation can enirv any measure through the two
Houses ol Congress , when the principle ol public action
will he open and avowed the President wants m\ vote,
and I want his patronage I will vote as be wishes and
he will give me the office I wish for What will tins be
but the government of one man > And what is the gov em
ment of one man but a monarchy7   Names are nothing '
Mr Chairman, when I read this report, I am
bound to believe that Thomas H Benton was
permitted to lift up the curtain of time, and view
with his naked eye the transactions of the pres
ent day How completely is the presidential
question swallowing up everything else ' In my
own State a candidate for Governor has made a
tour of the State, addressing the people He
scarcely condescended to notice State policy He
seemed to act from the belief that if he could
prove Henry Clay to be the biggest scoundrel
on earth, ana that a United States Bank was the
greatest monster on earth, it would follow as a
matter of course that Martin Van Buren was a
clever fellow, the sub Treasury bill a hermlesa
little animal, and of course that he would make
a good Governor These certainly were jump-
ing conclusions Nevertheless, it seemed to be
the opinion of the gentleman that it was the only
process necessary to accomplish his gubernato-
rial purpose. What have become of the pledges
made to curtail this patronage by the party'   I
