horses. The men retreated on island below Dardanelle,where Conly is trying to raise an old flat-boat lying there. There is no other force of the enemy in that section. I have sent scout this evening beyond Perryville, then up the Fourche; also one to Norristown, Dover, &amp;c. Is that infantry regiment coming? River rising.

LEWISBURG, July [14], 1864.

CAPTAIN: Lieutenant Williams in from scout to Norristown. All quiet on this side of the river. Great complaints made against Ninth Kansas Cavalry; they robbed men and women, friend and foe, indiscriminately. Captain Gill had a fight on Sunday with Captain Adams' company on river above Petit Jean, killing two and wounding several of the enemy. He is now after a force reported eight miles back of Dardanelle. Captain Adams' wife is now in Little Rock arranging to sell and get away cotton. She [has] sold and shipped seven bales already.

Respectfully,

CAPTAIN: I sent out Captain Hamilton, with fifty-five men, on Saturday,the 2nd,to go into Searcy County and break up a company of men organizing to join Shelby; he returned last night, having killed 7 rebels, wounded 4, and captured 1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 53 men, who had organized and were to start on Tuesday last for Shelby. He captured also 12 horses and mules, 15 stand of arms,and 1 stand of colors. Captain Hamilton reports from on organized [sic] a regiment north of Batesville, to join Shelby, who, he still thinks, is down on White River. One of the men killed by Captain Hamilton was a deserter from this regiment,who had joined the rebels. I will send the prisoners down by first boat.
