Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Colonel Pierce at Loudon reports to-day having sent some cavalry and Colonel Hawley's command, 700, into a strong pass on the National road, near Clear Spring, to make a show of force, and keep the wagon train from leaving Williamsport; the rest of his effective cavalry sent in the direction of the enemy, to make raids. He makes no report of any advance to the rear from Lee's army. From Reading one regiment will arrive here to-night, and two to-morrow. They will at once go forward. DuPont's battery, Fifth Artillery, will leave to-morrow; six guns.

Adjutant-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Yates, with three regiments and a battery of artillery of twelve 4-pounders, is beyond Carlisle. He will be joined by two regiments, ready to move from this place. This force can make a junction with Pierce, and move down the Cumberland Valley on the enemy's rear. Four regiments are nearly ready at Reading. These will also be pushed forward. We have no definite information this morning of the enemy's movements or position.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.

General LORENZO THOMAS,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

Your dispatch of this morning to the Secretary of War is before me. The forces you speak of will be of no imaginable service if they cannot go forward with a little more expedition. Lee is now passing the Potomac faster than the forces you mention are passing Carlisle. Forces now beyond Carlisle to be joined by regiments still at Harrisburg, and the united force again to join Pierce somewhere, and the whole to move down the Cumberland Valley, will, in my unprofessional opinion, be quite as likely to capture the "man in the moon" as any part of Lee's army.

Telegram of the President received. It is a slow business to organize militia and put them in march. I am afraid the President
