HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Near Whitley's Mill, N. C., April 10, 1865 - 4. 30 p. m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: I moved at the head of General Logan's column for three or four miles on the road toward Pikeville. We had to wait about two hours until his road was uncovered by the Twentieth Corps. I then joined General Blair, who had to cross three columns, so that he did not get his head of column out of town until between 11 and 12 o'clock. He marched with very little hindrance, his mounted infantry skirmishing slightly with the enemy's cavalry, and reached Whitley's Mill about 3 p. m. The bridge is but partially destroyed, some few of the planks being removed. The bridge is guarded and being repaired. There is another bridge across Little River at Lowell Factory. I hope to be able to cross Logan's three divisions there, and his detached division at Folk's Bridge. I have haeard some skirmishing and a little artillery to the left.

Very respectfully,

O. O HOWARD,

Major-General.
