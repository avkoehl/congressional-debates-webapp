HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 24, 1863-8. 30 a. m.

Commanding Officer Fifth Corps:

Lest my dispatch of 8 a. m. may not have reached you, the major-general commanding directs me to send you a duplicate. The reconnaissance to the point of the wooded hill, and the occupation of it, he now deems unnecessary, and directs that you move your corps on the Front Royal road, immediately in rear of General French's corps. The last division of General French is now on the road. Very respectfully, &amp;c.,A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 24, 1863-11 a. m.

GENERAL HUMPHREYS:

It is now certain that the enemy here is a mere observing party. Some horsemen, about a dozen, have gone off toward Chester Gap; other have moved north toward the Shenandoah. The two guns have gone I don't know where. There are some sick and wounded rebels in Front Royal. We have possession of all the road leading south. No more troops are needed here. General French, I suppose could visit the river, and get the bridge, if there; then go on through Chester Gap. I write this from a hill across Happy Creek, where the rebel cavalry are, and the spot where I left you is visible. Captain Cadwalader is with me.

G. K. WARREN,

Brigadier-General.
