WAR DEPARATMENT,

Washington, April 16, 1865-8.30 p. m.

Colonel NEWPORT,

Chief Quartermaster, Baltimore:

Send immediately to patrol and watch the west shore of the Chesapeake as far af Point Lookout for all the steamers in employment of this Deparatment in Baltimore. Let a vessel watch particularly the mouth of the Patuxent River. Put three or four armed men and each tug or other steamer. Let them keep out of sight, and admit on board any persons desiring to come off from shore. Detain all such persons; overhaul all small vessels or boats, and detain them until examined. The murderers of the President and Secretary of State have, it is believed, gone southeast, and will perhaps attempt to escape by water to the Eastern Shore, or to board some vessel waiting for them, or some vessel going to sea. The Potomac will be patrolled by steamers from Washington. Report the sailing of each vessl and the orders given her. Let a suitable vessel cruise up and down the bya and keep up communication. The object is to catch the murderers if they attempt this way of escape., Vigilance and speed.
