proprianott of $5,000, and insert $15,000, to complete andfurmsh
the marine hospital jf Mobile
Mi WHITE asked what recommendation was mad* by the
Secretary of theTreasuiy?
Mr EVANS said there was some ambiguity about the recom
mendation, whether bath $5 000 and 015 000 would be necessa
ry to complete the hospital, or only $15 000
After a few remarks from Meséis KING, BAGBY, CR1T
TENDEN, and EVANS, Mr King's amendment was adopted
The next amendment was page twenty five, line five hundred
and ninety five, to strike out "fifty," and insert "one hundred,"
being "for completing the custom house at Boston, fifty thou
sand dollars Provided the sum hereby appropriated be ex
pended, under the direction oí the Secretary of the Treasury,
in fitfng and preparing said building for the use ei the col ector
of the port of Boston, an 1 his officer-- and not in the continua
Uon of any ornamental parts thereof'
Mi EVANS exp lined thit the original bill was named wnh
©100000, and that the House stiuck out that sum and inserted
¿50,000, conceiving it stiffi lent to rendei the buildm? habir
able, leaving the ornamenta pait to be compkted at some
other time The committee had since discove ed that ir was
not practicable to make the building available fui business,
without canyng on ooih the common work and the niname^
tal woik I he building had already cost between $600000 and
$700,000, and k was believed, would cost two oi th ee huudied
thousand dollars more before it would be completed Congress
began the building with i s eyes open and, although it has been
a very extravagant affair, this wa& not the time to stop short of
the necessary appropriation0 to carry out the design, as the ai
chuects and employee? would ail have to be paid for doing half
work instead ot full woik
Mr CHOATE was well satisfied that the committee had
come to a just conclusion as to what ought to be done    By ap

the public works at Chicago retrieved from destruction, and the
Curnbeiland road placed m a flourishing condition, but he did
not enns der them more essentially entitled to special appropria-
tions than the works in other quarters ot the Union demanded
for the necessities of commerce
Mr BUCHANAN said he was very ansious that th s bill
should be pae«ed as speedily as would be consistent with an ex
animation of all thej ar iculaisthatmightrequire examination
Whilst they, without the slightes* hesitation, appropriated all
the necessary sums to pay themselves, the poor clerks in the
different departmen s, who were living from band to m«uth,
were now almost starving, or else being sha\ed by the brokers,
at the late of about fiftean or twea v per cent in order to pro
cure subsistence foi then famiheb He was therefore eon y that
the debate had branched out in the way it had, beyond i's pro*
per limits, and that they were to discuss the improvement of
the harbor of Chingo, of Milwaukee, and of Michigan city, and,
to cap the ehmax, thaWhey were totiavel upon the Cumber
land road, and all this whi e consideripgthe subject of the cus-
tom houce at Be ston He would gladly, if it weie in his power,

the B iston custom hou*e he believed there had been the most

sum already expended, it must be completed—that was inevi
table Ihe chairman of the Committee on Finance had in
foi med them that debts I ~ 1 beer* contracted in the p osecution
of the wcrk to the amount of nearly $t0 000 He had no doubt
that tin . wt*reill\ thecal, because it was uniformly the case
that then public offueis t-xceeded the appropriations, a hmg
which they ought never to do It was i bad practice But
if debts had been contracted, they nu^tbe paid, that was in
evitable The buildings must b complete 1, ind fir his own

the House was aware of this arrearage of $50,000. Congress
makes an appropriation rora«pecificobject1 andtheagenfsem-

transcend their duty or powers as to incur a debt of $60,000

Mr EVANS was very sorry the passage of the bill was
likely to be delayed by a gratuitous discussion. The Senator
from Kentucky was now determined not to vote for any extrava-

for it to go on without remonstrance Butnow that the work,

the plan—and all the essential parts must be carried on simul-

000   not to complee the building, but to produce a picturesque
mass of luifis He was opposed to this mode of inefficient ap-
propi iaf ion It was the system which had brought the country
into debt The result of cutting off appropriations short of the
estimates, is to mike the works for which they are granted
