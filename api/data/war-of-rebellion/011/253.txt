NEAR DANVILLE, June 4, 1862.

[Major-General HALLECK]:

The two divisions of General Buell had best proceed at once to Rienzi, on the Mobile and Ohio road. The bearer will conduct them. When there they will receive further instructions.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, June 4, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

Move two of your divisions early in the morning by forced marches in the direction of Baldwyn, to re-enforce Pope and Rosecrans.

H. W. HALLECK,Major-General.

CAMP NEAR CORINTH, June 4, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

Should you find the presence of General Buell's forces unnecessary, let me know at once.

If your troops are without supplies, draw them back to where they can get them. The object of your advance was to press the enemy and hasten his retreat as far south as possible. If you have gone farther than you expected, it has resulted from the circumstances of the retreat as reported by you. At any event we will not proceed beyond Baldwyn. On the arrival of General Buell you will transfer to his column the divisions of Davies and T. W. Sherman. Keep me hourly informed of the state of affairs, and I will send forward two more divisions to-day from here, and also move Major-General Sherman's command across from the Memphis road to Kossuth.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS, June 4, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

You will exercise your own discretion as to the road to be followed. Rienzi is the shortest route to Baldwyn, but I have no satisfactory information in regard to the road as compared with that by Danville.

H. W. HALLECK,Major-General.

BUELL'S HEADQUARTERS, June 4, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

I informed you upon impulse this morning that I should accompany the two divisions I was directed to send to re-enforce General Pope. It afterward occurred to me that, considering I rank him, it would perhaps have been more proper that I should wait for you to indicate to me when you desire my presence in front, but as you inform me since
