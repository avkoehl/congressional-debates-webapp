Assistant Adjutant-General, &amp;c.:

MAJOR: In accordance with verbal instructions from the commanding general, received through Major Jenkins, I have taken the necessary steps to attack the blockader in North Edisto River on Wednesday morning next, the tide being suitable. The only fear I have is a rear movement of the enemy in the direction of Legareville. I have directed two Napoleon guns to be posted at Aberpoolie Creek, at the point where the Legareville road crosses that stream, but an infantry support is needed. The bridge at Saxby's having been completed, this force might come over on Tuesday and return Wednesday evening. As it is of the utmost importance to protect this position. I hope that at least two companies of infantry may be sent. Cannot a sufficient number of artillerists be spared to man the 30-pounder Parrott?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. H. ROBERTSON,
