(Received 8. 10 p. m.)

General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have nothing reliable as to rebel infantry in the Valley to-day. Their cavalry advance is within 5 miles of Carlisle. Haller at Gettysburg, with some cavalry and a regiment of infantry. Only you know that the rebels are in the mountains. The are also making cavalry raids in Pennsylvania north of Hancock. Most of the men that rushed to arms at Altoona and south are rushing home.

D. N. COUCH.

BALTIMORE, June 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General TYLER, Harper's Ferry:

The lieutenant-colonel you wished me to arrest was armed with a leave by your order. All communications to Generals Hooker and Halleck should go through these headquarters. Will see what can by done with Maulsby's battery and Graham's command. Pennsylvania clings to troops. The Eleventh Army Corps moved over at Point of Rocks, and battery at Edwards Ferry. General Lockwood's brigade marches to the Monocacy. Your request at to assistant adjutant-general urged on Department. Your orders. Through Coleman, attended to.

DONN PIATT,

Chief of Staff.
