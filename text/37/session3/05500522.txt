ify my amendment'
I he SPEAKER. The previous question is

POST OFFICE APPK0P1UATI0N BILL.
Mr. STEVENS. I move that the Post Office
appropriation bill be made the special order in the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union
for to-day.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS. \ now move that the rules he
suspended, and that the House resolve itself into
the Commiltee of the "Whole on the .state of the
Union.
Mr. OLIN. I wish the gentleman from Penn-
sylvania would allow the committees to be called.
Xhete is a variety of important business, espe-
cially in charge of the Committee on Military Af-
fairs, that requires tiie action of the House; and
unless the committees can be called 1 shall be con-
strained to ask the indulgence of the Jiouse to
have some days assigned for the transaction of
that business.
Mr. STEVENS. It will take but half an hour
to get through with this bill, and we can then get
at the gentleman's business.
^ Mr. MAYJNARD. I ask the gentleman from
Pennsylvania to allow an hour or an hour and a
Ik'lf before the special order shall apply in the
; Committee oftho Wholeon the state ofthe Union.
Mr. STEVENS. I think we had better go
through with this Lull.
Mr. STrivKN&'h motion wasagreed to.
So the ru'es were suspended; and the House
resolved iis'df into the Committee ofthe Whole on
th*"1 state oflhe Union, (Air. Cox in the chair,) and
proceeded ro the consideration of the hill of the
House (No. Guo) making appropriations for the
service of the Post Office Department during the
fiscal year ending the 30th of June, 1864.
Mr. STEVENS. I move that the first leading
ofthe bill for information be dispensed with.
Objection was made.
The bill was read a Inst time for information.
The Clerk then proceeded to read the bill by
sections for amendment.
Mr. COL pax. Mr. Chairman, I move to re-
duce the appropriation for paper for blanks from
$60,000 to ^54,000,and to add the following words:
Foi compensation of blank agents and assistants, £6.000.
_ This does not add anything tn the appropiia-
tion, but only distributes it. it is recommended
by the Post Office Depaitmcnt.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk read as follows:
Fot mail depiedattons and special agents, ,$'75,000.
Mr. COLFAX. Mr. Chan man, it is probable
(hat the^viiole of that uppiopimturn will not be
needed for the coming fiscal year unless the Union

During the coll of she mil,

qiu uce of indisposition.
Mi. CRI Sh 1 ELfJ stated thai Al>*."Webster was
absent from the House ni the military seivjce of
the Lountry.
Mr. lib TC1-HNS stated that Mr. Riddll Isad
paired with Mr. Walton, of Vermont.
The vote was announced as above recorded.
I he bill, as arm nded, w as then ordered to be en-
grossed and r^adatmrd tinif : and boingcngrossed
it was accordingly read the third time. " '
e again extended throughout every part of the
country. It was difficult tor the Department to
tell exactly what parts of the Union would be
restoud to the flag in the next year, and this ap-
propriation ivs based upon a service for all of the
states. It will not, of course, be all used except in
that contingency, which I sincerely hope may oc-
cur. it is thought that about two thn ds ofh will
be required if matters should remain as they are
now, which I hope is neirherprobable norpossible.
The Clerk read as follows:
For miscellaneous pav ment-i
Mr. COLFAX. I'movo

The amendment was agreed to.
iur. HOLMAN. I ask my colleague what is
the aggregate of apnropnation^ mad<' by this bill?
_ Air. COLhAX. The aggiegate of appiopna-
Hons under this bill will be $12,000,000.
