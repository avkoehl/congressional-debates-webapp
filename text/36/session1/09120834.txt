THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 20,
The amendment is a formal one, which nobody
will object to. It is required to be made in con-
sequence of a mistake of the committee as to the
persons to whom the money should be paid. I
trust the Senate will allow the bill to be taken up
and acted on.
Mr. CRITTENDEN. I feel every disposition
in the world to oblige the Senator from California,
but I have some reports to make. They will n8t
preclude his bill being taken up afterwards, and
then I shall be very happy to oblige him.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The first busi-
ness strictly in order is the presentation of memo-
rials and petitions.
Mr. HA UN. I hope the Senator from Ken-
tucky will allow this bill to pass. I now only
want to amend it by correcting a mistake in the
name. I do not think any one will argue it or dis-
cuss it. It is a very small matter.
Mr. IVERSON. I make this additional appeal
to the Senate in this case, on behalf of the Senator
from California. He is about to leave the Senate
in a few days, and as he takes a great deal of per-
sonal interest in this bill, I trust the Senate will
indulge him.
Several Senators. Let us take it up.
The bill (S. No. 117) for the relief of Santiago
E. Arguello, was read a second time, and con-
sidered as in Committee of the Whole.
It proposes to direct the Secretary of the Treas-
ury to pay to Santiago E. Arguello, late a captain
in the California battalion, the sum of $14,888,
for losses t>f property sustained by him during
the period of such service, and in consequence
thereof.
The petitioner was a wealthy and influential
inhabitant of California, residing in the vicinity
of San Diego. On the invasion of that country
during the Mexican war, and on the appearance of
the proclamation of Commodore Stockton, then in
command of that division of the American forces,
Arguello placed himself at the head of a company
raised through his influence and exertions, and
immediately joined the United States forces, and
fought with distinguished bravery and effect in
several actions, under the command of Commo-
dore Stockton, who fully attests his gallantry and
the importance of his services. On the 25th No-
vember, 184C, he was appointed by Governor
Stockton a captain of riflemen in the California
battalion, and, on the 16th January, 1847, amem-
berofthe Legislative Council of thatTerritory. In
consequence of his attachment to the cause of the
United States, and the zeal and activity which he
manifested in their service, his rancho was rav-
aged and laid waste, his buildings burnt, and his
cattle and other movable effects taken away by
the enemy, by which he appears to have been re-
duced from competence and wealth to penury and
dependence. A commission, appointed by H.
Fitch, Esq., alcaide of San Diego, to examine and
report upon the losses of Arguello, state, under
oath, and after a personal examination, that the
personal property thus destroyed by the enemy
amounted, " at the lowest value," to ยง14,888.
Mr. HAUN. I move to amend the bill in line
four, after the word " to," by inserting " G-auda-
lupc Lstudillo de Arguello, widow of."
The amendment was agreed to.
1 he bill was reported to the Senate as amended,
and the amendment was concurredin; and the bill
was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time.
It was read the third time, and passed.
Mr. HAMLIN. I suggest that the title ought
to be changed to correspond with the text.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That will be
done.
The title was amended so as to read, "A bill
for the relief of Gaudalupe Estudillo de Arguello,
widow of Santiago E. Arguello."
