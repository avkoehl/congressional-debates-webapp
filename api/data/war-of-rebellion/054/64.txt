that are exhausted and out of ammunition. Also another brigade from Chattanooga. What ammunition we have has been sent forward, and is by this time up to the mountains where General Tyndale's brigade is posted, where you can get it. When all these troops arrive detach a regiment to go and escort up the supply train 3 miles back toward Whiteside's. Is your rear toward Whiteside's open? Can you send down in Lookout Creek Valley and find out anything for us concerning the enemy, with scouts or otherwise?

Very respectfully,

Major-General REYNOLDS,

Chief of Staff, Chattanooga:

The position now held and being intrenched by General Geary this side of Wauhatchie, at the forks of Kelley's Ferry and Chattanooga roads, should have the supervision of a competent engineer to locate lines and works in the most advantageous manner; the position is a very important one. I have no engineer officer in the command. I have to request that one may be sent out here at once.

Very respectfully,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General REYNOLDS,

Chief of Staff, Chattanooga:

General Schurz reports large columns of the enemy seen to march down along Lookout Creek, and then, turning to the right, marching up the mountain. Is it not possible to injure them from the Moccasin Point or other batteries on the north side of the river? The prisoners captured last night on the ridge carried by Smith's brigade are sent in herewith.

Very respectfully,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
