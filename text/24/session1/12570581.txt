Ho. of Reps.
cey county, in the same congressional district.
As it had been the practice in some parts of the
State to permit a poison to vote in any county in
the dtstitcl, provided he rtsided in the dtitnct, it
was agretd by the pidges that they might vote,
and tin j wouid note opposite their names " Yan-
ce\ ," and ctrtify the ficts upon the scrolK, or
pod lis"!, ind u mi n them to the centtal judges at
Asln villi, and if they adpidgid tint a person
* cou'd vott out of the county of his residence, then
the thrte votts wen to rtmain good, but if they
adjudged otherwise, then the votes were to be
d diutid Tin ctrtificatt u as made on the scrolls,
aid signed bv the pidges, that the thiee peisons
IimiI in \antey. This was sent to the judges at
Aslnviilt, and, on Uuther explanation by one of
the recording clerks, V Blackstock, w hoattendid
the Henderson precincts, where the votes were
received, the judges deducted the thiee votes
Thtse ficts all appear by the depositions taken
b) the petition r The committte say this de-
duction uas unauthorized by the laws of JNorth
Ciroliaa Suppose they had not the power' Yet,
it we are sat is fit d by the evidence that these
three persons did vote llleg illy, we should be
bound by the same rule that has governed the
committee in striking out all non-resident votes,
to dtduct them lurt, if tlu judges had not done
so These are the tacts in the case, though the
committee say the votts ought to be counted I
shtll state but two more errors, and close the re-
Tll .
The next class of votes referred to in the re-
portare six, which are said to have been tendered
to the inspectors or judges, for the petitioner, and
by them rejected This case presents one of the
extraordinary, claims, and involves the most sin-
gular and no\el principle in the whole case, and
vet the report has devoted two lines only upon
it They are in these words " To this [tbe be-
fore mentioned three votes] the committee have
added five votes (m list A) as having been legally
offered for the petitioner, and illegally refused'"
Tne law ot North Carolina provides that " before
any person shall be allowed to vote, he shall, if
required, make oath that he is qualified according
to the constitution, and has not voted before at
the same election " By this provision it is made
the duty of the judges to íefuse the vote of any
individual of doubtful qualifications In this they
act judicially, and may persist in their refusal
unless the electoi shall tender the legal oath. The
duties and rights of both the judges and electors
are made plain If the latter desires to vote, and
the formerdoubts his legal qualification, the elec-
tor has only to tender his oath, and then it is
peremptory on the judge to receive his vote, pro-
vided his oath will establish his qualification.
At the Franklin precinct, in Macon county, on
canvassing the votes there, five votes were found
in the Commons box with the name of David
Newland, the petitioner, on each, but nothing to
di sígnate for what office they were intended
The^witness states that there were a number of
votes for members of the State Legislature found
in the Congress box. The judges changed these
votes, placing the five votes with the name of
David New land in the Congress box, and counted
them for the petitioner The íeport attempts to
give the evidence in this case, but has clearly mis-
taken it, or misstated the facts It charges the
judges with the mistake in placing INewland s
votes in the wrong box This charge is not cor-
rect, as is shown by the same report It states
that the ballot-boxes for m< mbers of Congress
and State officers were seven or eight feet apart.
In North Carolina each ballot-box is kept by sep-
arate sets of judges The voter presents his vote
rolled up so as to conceal the name, and, I am in-
formed, there is no designation of office on the
vote. How, then, was it possible for the judges
to make the mistake' He puts into his box (and
there is only one within eight feet of him) the
vote which is given him It is not the judgewho
puts the vote in the box, but the person who hand?
fnm the vote, that must make the mistake 1 he
report says
"In this ca=e, then, the mistake having been made by
one of th« judges, and not by the voter, who had done every
thing in his power tovvird a fair exerci.e of bis pnvi ege,
the judges have considered it their duty to correct their
mistake, and give the voter bis vote.
In this case the judges no doubt acted in good
faith, and with honest and fair motives, but they
were cleaily wrong. This House has said, in
two of its reported cases, that, where votes aie
given by ballot, the tiitfnfion of the totet is Inown.
onltiby the box u hey e he deposits Ins vote In the case
of Washburn  s Ripley, (Clarke and Hall, page
G79,) this principle is ch ally settled, and, indeed,
no other i ule could be adopted with any pi osp< ct
of pieservmg the elective handlist puicaudin-
coiruptible [fthecourst puisucd by thesejudges
were sanctioned, it would put it in the power of
tht lll-dispoved to give as many votes for one can-
didate as there aie ballot bo\t s at tin pieeincts
whtie he votes. This House nevei will sanction
such a piactice
I have been thus minute in the review of this
report, not so much with a view of discussing
directly the merits of the main question, as of
calling the attention of the House to the great
danger it would incur of doing injustice by adopt-
ing in gross the conclusions of the report, with-
out examining in detail the various piopositions
upon which the leal merits of the case depend,
and of making a clear and distinctive decision of
them by a direct vote of this House Sir, if
this course should be adopted, I have but little
doubt the final vote of the House would confirm
the light of the sitting member Cut, if we are
to labor on in this tinceifain mode of general
debate, until the last sand of out measured time
shall have passed out, and the pi enous question
sprung upon us, and all debate and amendments
prohibited, I should then have as little doubt that
the decision of the people would be reversed, and
the petitioner admitted to a seat
The remarks and comments which I have made
on the report of the majority have been dictattd
by noneotht r than the kindest feelings of personal
regard for the members of that branch of the
committee. I have avoided, as injustice I should
have done, any imputation of improper motives,
on the contrary, I have felt deposed to sympa-
thize in the perplexities of their labouous task
I have been ready to ascribe all erior and mis-
take to the numberless difficulties the committee
had to encounter, but, as it had been remarked .
frequently in debate, that the repoit carried with
it high authority, and fearing that many might,
as is common, take it as conclusive as to the
truth of the statements it contained, I felt called
upon by a duty I owed to myself as a member
of the minority of the committee, and by a sense
of duty to this House, and the people of North
Carolina, to speak out, and warn the House of
the danger of the course they weie pursuing, by
adopting, in gross, the conclusions of a report
involving so many inaccm acies
Befoie I sit down I would dnect the attention
of the House to the conclusion which seems to
me the necessary result of the consideiation of
the legal points and facts to which I have alluded
in the remarks I have just submitted
The majority contend that they have found
evidence to establish the illegality of nineteen
votes, which were given to Graham, and which
ought to be deducted, viz thirteen given by non-
residents of the county, five non-residents of the
State, and one minoi, making nineteen. They
also claim that the three Yancey votes, given at
Hendeison, Buncombe county, and ícjectcd by
thejudges at Asheville, should be r-stored to his
polls, and lastly, six votes which were tendered
to the board,and rejected,should be addtd to his
polls, which, in all, would make twenty-eight
votes to be credited to him, thus:
Nineteen votes, non-residents and minors... 19
Three Yancey votes tendered and rejected .. 3
Six votes tendered and rtjected............6
They also credit to Graham,
Eight bad votes given to Newland......... 8
Seven original majority...................7
—15
Difference and majority for petitioner......13
Among the nineteen illegal votes alleged to have
been given to Mr. Graham, the sitting member,
four are supposed to be given by persons whose
names do not appear upon'the scrolls. These
scrolls, in some States called poll-lists, are made
out and certified by the sheriff of the county,
under the piovisions of the hws of Noith Cuo-
lina, one copy of which he is leqnntd to fi'e in
the cleik's orín p of the county, abei " the same
is certified by the shei iff "    Thrse scrolls, duly
authenticated under the spal of the clcik of the
county, aie the highest and most solemn < vidence
of the imtteis contained  in  tin n      Tin v  me
especially the highest evidence of the tnu'i as to
vho did vote, and lino ?)ioni/     As the nanus of
these four individuals d>  not appi at  upon the
polls ceitifi d to us, mid f umsh us, too, by the
petitioiu i   hnnsrlf, a question ir s< s win ihu he,
th    petitionei, shill be pt imittcd to give parol
ovidi nee of third peisons tint these foui peisons
did vote'    The manner in which the  polls are
kept by a shenfi and two inspeetois, sworn to
conduct the elections/an ly and honestly, and who
are requited to keep each a separate list of all who
vote, which lists aie to be compaicd and certified
by them to the sheriff, furnishes the most solemn
and veritable evidence of the conectness of the
icgistiy as to who did vote     And by permitting
third persons to give evidence by parol to con-
tradict this, would be a gioss depiiture from the
oldest and most salutary rules of legal evidence.
The pi oof, thertfoic, that these four votes were
given to Giaham, must fail     This will reduce
their numbct to twenty-foui, or, in otht r woids,
will reduce tht nineteen illegal votes to fifteen   If
the view which I lnve taki n of the piopin ty of
allowing the six votes tendticd and rejected be
coireet, there must be deducted six votes more,
and if the view which 1 have tiken of the three
votes given for the petitioner at Henderson, Bun-
combe county, by the three citizens of " Yancey "
be correct, then thiee more must be deducted fiom
the numbei of illegal votes, which the petitioner
alleges should be deducted fiom Griham's polls,
leaving of the twenty eight alleged illegal vott s,
but fifteen, which, in any event, should be de-
ducted fiom the sitting memhei's polls   Bad votes
foi Giaham, in all,filteen     Now, sir, U t us con-
sidei the votes which Mr  Giaham contends aie
illegal,and which, having bien given to the peti-
tioner, he claims should be deducted
There were eight votes which aie cleaily pi oven
to have been illegally given to Newland, which
should be deducted from his polls On them the
I committee weie unanimous They aie illegal
beyond contradiction To these should be added
the five votes which were impropeily exchanged
from the Commons to the copgiessional box for
Newland, for the reasons which I have just
stated, which would make thirteen illegal votes
given to Newland. and to be cieditrd toGralnm
If to this you add tin seven votes, his original
majonty, the sitting member's polls will stand
thus
1st   Eight bad votes  by agieement of com-
mittee............................8
2d   Five votes illegally exchanged........5

If from these twenty you tike votes credited

Sir, I sincerely bdieve, it this cist were pre-
st nted to a )urv, acting undi i a solemn oath to
find a true Verdict horn the \-\w and facts hefoic
us, they could not come to a ícsult moie favoi-
able to the petitionei
But, sir, the sitting member claims to have al-
lowed him ten moie votes, which aie pioved to
have been illegally given for the petitioner by the
documents which have been laid on our tables
since this report came in, and this forms the last
point with which I shall trouble the House. It
is clearly light that these should be allowed.
They have been taken under notice duly served
according to the laws and practices adopted by
the petitioner himself, they have been printed,
by consent, and laid before us The proofs are
clear and conclusive, consisting, in most cases,
of the oaths of the voters themselves, that ten
more illegal votes were given to the petitioner,
which, according to the cleat est estimates, would
swell the sitting member's majority to fifteen
votes Sir, we dare not reject this evidence, it
| is before us; it is legal, it tells us, in audible
