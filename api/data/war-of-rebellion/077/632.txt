Two regiments of his rear guard were sent to my front during the night to the 5th, attacking my picket-lines. Early in the morning, with a portion of my command, drove them through Florence. One company of cavalry from General Rousseau's command reached this point late last evening for the purpose of taking possession of the Bainbridge crossing, the general's main command being some twenty- five miles from here on the old military road. I will leave in the morning on my return to Athens, where I am in hopes to receive orders for my future movements and railroad transportation for my command.

Captain RAMSEY,

A. A. G., Major-General Thomas' Staff, Nashville, Tenn.:

Your dispatch of this date received one mile WEST of Athens. The head of my DIVISION is now pushing through the town. I will move to Bridgeport with all possible dispatch. My men are a good deal broken down from excessive rains and bad roads; many of them barefooted. I left Florence by order of Major-General Rousseau on the morning of the 10th instant. All your dispatches sent me beyond Athens were lost or captured. One of my dispatches from Shoal Creek was lost in Elk River. I forwarded through General Starkweather, at Pulaski, duplicate copy of this dispatch, which I hope you have received. If possible, I would like railroad transportation for my broken-down men. I am in hopes to hear from you at Huntsville. I will be here till 12 m. to-day.

J. D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.
