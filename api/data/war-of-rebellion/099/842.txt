SOLON A. CARTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, NINETEENTH ARMY CORPS,Moregead, March 14, 1865.

Brigadier-General SCHOFIELD,

Chief of Staff;

I arrived here this morning with 1,000 men of this division. Am now landing troops, and at suggestion of General Easton leave for New Berne by railroad this p. m.

Respectfully,

H. W. BIRGE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH,Charleston, S. C., March 14, 1865.

Major General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: If you will order the quartermaster to have a coal vessel towed here by the Coit and send me one or two steamers it would be of great service at present. Both the tin-clads are broken, and the steamers necessarily useless. The officer in charge of the foundry here will cast new wheels as soon as the molds can be prepared and coal obtained. It is a great pity, for I am told the governor of South Carolin, with a large party of officials, is not far from the Santee, on the Wilmington railroad, waiting the repairing of the bridge over the Wateree. The only steamer I have here is the Anna Maria. One of Colonel Hallowell's brigades has left. I am very sorry I had not your permission to substitute the Twenty-first for the Thirty-third U. S. Colored Troops in time. I send a section of the battery from Beaufort on the Coit, and will send the remainder as soon as transportation can be procured. The One hundred and forty-fourth [New York] and Thirty-second [U. S. Colored Troops] are only waiting transportation. I will set the negroes to work on the fortifications immediately.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN P HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. NORTHERN DISTRICT, DEPT. OF THE SOUTH,Charleston, S. C., March 14, 1865.

Captain W. L. M. BURGER, Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 13th instsant. I have issued instructions for the regiments named by you to be ready to move, and will use every exertion to have them put in serviceable condition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
