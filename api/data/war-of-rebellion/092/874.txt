General S. COOPER:

This morning enemy had advance on the line of Georgia railroad as far as Oconee River. I believe it to be Slocum's corps. Wires cut near Macon. I have no communication with General Hardee since morning. Fighting reported near Macon.

WEST POINT, MISS., November 20, 1864.

General WHEELER:

General Hardee will for the present give orders for the defense of Georgia east of the Chattahoochee. My views are that positions should be defended only so long as not to risk safety of troops and materials required for active operations in the field. Meanwhile remove to safe locality all Government property on line of enemy's march, and consume or destroy all supplied within his reach.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
