INDIANAPOLIS, July 9, 1863.

General BOYLE:

Do you expect an attack? General Mansfield, at New Albany, thinks there will not be one there, and that Morgan will move upon here. Is he well watched at Corydon? Where is Hobson?

If Morgan moves up this way, I want Biddle's regiment and the battery. Can Hobson overtake him?

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 9, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

Have you any more information as to Morgan's movements?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 9, 1863.

General WILLCOX, Indianapolis:

Please answer my dispatch of this morning, 9 o'clock, as to any news from the enemy, &amp;c.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 9, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

The information received here indicates that Morgan will march into the interior of Indiana. Are there no troops in Kentucky that can be spared and sent into Indiana?

O. P. MORTON.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 9, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

I ask that the Seventy-first Indiana and Twenty-third Indiana Battery, recently sent to Kentucky, be immediately ordered back to this State for its protection-the protection of our towns from burning and pillage. Indiana has repeatedly sent all her troops to protect Kentucky. I now ask the return of some for our own protection.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.

INDIANAPOLIS, July 9, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

Can't you send some cannon to this place from Cincinnati or Columbus, to be placed in batteries immediately? We have nothing here but small-arms. The rebels have occupied Corydon, in Harrison County. I am organizing militia as fast as possible.

O. P. MORTON,

Governor of Indiana.
