CAPTAIN: Pursuant to circular of this date, calling for report of operations since 16th of January, I have the honor to state that on the 16th of January, when the Third Division, Twentieth Army Corps, marched from Cheves' farm, this regiment, with Twenty-sixth Wisconsin Volunteers, was detailed to remain for the purpose of guarding a wagon train that had been sent to the landing for supplies. On the 18th the regiment rejoined the brigade at Hardeeville. Here we remained quietly in camp until January 29, when, with the brigade, we marched toward Robertsville, which placed was reached about 10 a. m. of the 30th. The next day the regiment, with the brigade, passed through Robertsville and camped some three miles from Sister's Ferry.

On the 1st of February this regiment, with the Seventy-third Ohio Volunteer Infantry, was engaged in corduroying and repairing the road to Sister's Ferry. On the 2nd of February we again broke camp, and, with the brigade, marched through Lawtonville in the direction of Barnwell Court-House. On the 6th the column turned it the direction of Branchville crossing the Salkehatchie River, striking the Charleston and Augusta Railroad at Graham's Turnout on the 7th. This regiment, with the brigade, was employed all of the 8th in destroying railroad track in the vicinity of Graham's. On the 9th the regiment, with the brigade, marched to Blackville, and were busily employed during the 9th and 10th in tearing up track between Blackville and White Pond Station. From White Pond we marched to the South Edisto, which we were, unable to cross until the morning of the 12th, the enemy having destroyed the bridge. On the 13th the North Edisto River was crossed, we marching in the direction of Lexington. On the 16th of February the column turned toward Columbia, and preparations made for an engagement, which did not come off. From Columbia the regiment marched with the brigade, crossing the Saluda and Broad Rivers, entering Winnsborough February 21. Thence we marched with the regiment [brigade?] in toward Chesterfield, crossing the Great Pedee River at Cheraw, and passed through Fayetteville on 13th of March,
