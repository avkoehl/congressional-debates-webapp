and pettifo^girg, so as to render it impossible to

does lie not perceive that he arrogates to himself
and hw party \X\ul they would not do this' We,
E.t most, only ask to elect one lawyer to two they
have already elected Does he not assume that one
s lected by js would take up twice as much time
as out selected by them, and thus arrogate to him-
self and his paity more integrity and intelligence
than he is willing snould be ascribed to others, in
the ratio of two to one' It is no new idea that
his party arrogate to themselves all the intelligence
and honesty We are not particular as to the
individual we choose, as three out of a dozen, oi
a gi eater number, would suit us We can give
you twelve names, out of which you may select
three [Loud cries of "give us the names, we
will take you at your word "] I am only de-
euous that each party should enter upon this
investigation on fair terms, and not have what
the gentleman from Virginia had so frequently
< ailed a stocked-pack committee The argument
for the appointment of the committee by the House
was, that we might avoid what the gentleman him-
self had called unfairness in the Speaker in appoint-
ing the committee The Speaker, according to
custom, had appointed a majority of Administra-
tion men upon all important committees, and had
observed the will of those opposed to the Admin-
istration in regard to the minority appointments,
and yet his committees were denounced as stocked-
pack and sex-ires committees
And what have the majority of the House now
done, each man of them' Have they not done
woi&e than the very thing they denounced in harsh
terms when it was done by the Speaker ' The dif-
ference—it is manifest, and consists in this the
Speaker legaided the will of the minority, so far
as I have learned, in appointing the minority of
select committees, appointed by him, the Opposi-
tion have disregaided entirely the will of the mi-
nority That which is worse than a vice yester
day, is a virtue to day Now, if the gentleman
fiom Virginia will allow me to use his term, sex-
tics, I will not abuse it, I wi'l apply it to the elec
tion of this committee Is not this a sex-ties
committee, m the worst sense5 I do not wish to
do injustice to any man in attributing to him a po-
sition, and hope, if I do so, I may be corrected at
once I repeat, is not this a " stocked pack," a
" sex iiej" committee' And under what circum-
stances was it not argued by the gentleman from
Vuginia, [Mr Wisg,] that, if an election by the
Houhe could be had, a due regard would be had
to all paities' And when the balloting came on,
a dozen of the Administration party, whom I see
around me, voted for three of the very men from
the Opposmon that are elected—men designated
by their fi lends—men, too, for whom some of the
Conservatives and Whigs even did not vote And
if as many Whigs had voted for the persons desig-
nated by us, the committee would have been organ-
ized two day3ago Upon whatground of fairness,
then, are we charged with a desire to prolong or
delay this investigation ' Had we been met in
any spirit of fairness, the committee would have
been easily chosen The sin does not he at our
door, but at the door of the Opposition And now,
again, in reference to my colleague [Mr Taylor]
I desire not to be misunderstood As a member
of this House, taking all his duties into considera-
tion, I think him among the first an1* ablest men
in it His constituents know that he is honest and
capable, or they would not have thrice honored
him with a seat on this floor It is because he is
anablemanthat he was elected to serve on this com-
mittee, that the Opposition might, when charged
■with unfairness, say, we elected one of yourablest
men—there was some cunning in it Be assured
that he would not have been elected, had he been
as highly qualified for serving upon this committee
as he is for the discharge of any other duly that
might, in the course of legislation, devolve upon
him. It was treating him with unfairness Would
any one here employ a physician to try an eject-
ment' Why, then, force him to serve on this com-
mittee, where constructions are to be given to
statutes, and perhans unwilling witnesses to be
cross examined' We have a feeling m this mat-
ter, a sense of justice, of self-respect, and of duty,
■which must prevent us from yielding to the elec-
tion which has token place.    The self-respect of
my colleague [Mi Taylor] prompts him to the
course he has taken And, under all the circum-
stances, should he not be excused by the House,
and should he surrender his seat here in preference
to his self respect, which he is bound, by duty to
his constituents and himself, to preserve, oid Onon-
daga would hail and welcome him home, and set
down his conduct on the occasion to a new ac-
count of credit
Mi PRENTISS, of Mississippi,saidhe wished
the gentlem m from New York [Mi Gray] would
make the proposition he had spoken of, and thus
save all further debate, otherwise the House might
never be able to find out what he and his friends
wanted In selecting men to represent the Ad
ministration party on this committee, (Mr P
continued,) we have chosen fiom among those
who have been the most prominent actors here,
and who have, on all occasions, put themselves
forward to fight the battles of the Administration
on this floor If there is yet a corps in reserve,
of which we know nothing, bring them forward,
and let us make our selection
This morning, (Mr P said,) in an ill-omened
paper which lay upon his desk, he had seen that
which indicated that there was no probability of
organizing a committee He would read a small
portion of the croaking of the official raven. Mr.
P  then read the following extract from the Globe
" The three Democratic members elected, viz
' Messrs Elmore, Cüshman, and H„bley, de-
' clmed serving on the committee When we left
' the House to close our paper, the Opposition
' majority, now notoriously obtained by the per-
' feet amalgamation of the Conservative with the
' National Bank party, selected three other Dem-
' ociats, to be made prisoners m the hands of the
1 committee—having their arms locked by an
' enemy on each side, like the Daniel Boon's men,
' sent out to treat with the Indians beleaguering
' his fort The hardy backwoodsmen soon found
1 that the object of the savages was to make them
' prisoners, and acted accordingly We have no
' doubt the Democrats will follow out successfully
' the part played by Boon's men on that occasion,
■ and leave the Opposition to experience the fate of
' the perfidious enemy on that occasion, if their
' purposes should correspond, as the secret mach-
' ¡nations in the appointment of the committee
' would seem to indicate "
Now, here was a proposition thrown out by the
organ of the party, that no Democrat should serve,
because, forsooth, they cannot get a majority upon
the committee After having professed themselves
wilung to act, they now come forward, and what
do they say' Yesterday (said Mr P ) personal
considerations were urged, but to day we hear
nothing of that kind, but it is openly avowed that
the reason why they will not serve is, that they
will not act unless represented by three of their
most astute lawyeis Was not the gallant gentle-
man from New Hampshire, [Mr Cüshman,] who
had taken upon himself the defense of the Secre-
tary of the Treasui y before the House, sufficiently
acute to undertake a similar task before toe com
mittee' He is the chairman of the Committee
on Commerce, and ex district attomey of New
Hampshire Is not he qualified to serve' And,
if not, where are we to look for the men ' Has
not the gentleman from New York, [Mr Tay-
lor,] with all his modesty, spoken ably and
eloquently m defense of the Administration upon
this very question, and upon the great Sub-
Treasury scheme at the last session ' And yet he
says that he is not competent to serve The very
ingenuity with which he has made his argument,
and the facility of speech with which he has urged
his motion to be excused, show that if he is not a
lawyer by study, he is, at least, a lawyer by na-
ture But I say that, by his very profession, he
is better fitted to serve than another man We
are about to examine into the diseases of the
Commonwealth, we want to probe them, we
want to apply the purge and the knife, and, as I
understand the gentleman is a distinguished disci-
ple of iEsculapius, he is, of course, the very man
for our purpose
It is said there are six against three If a man
is free from all feeling of guilt, he has nothing to
fear The House has solemnly decided, and I
thank God that such has been its decision, that
they will not trust a committee appointed in the
usual way No, it was to be a committee sin-
cerely favoiable to investigation Three have re-
signed, and thiee more have been recommended
to do the same thing, although I do not insinuate
that they have acted on that recommendation.
But the objection of the gentleman from New
York [Mr T\ylor] is, that he does not under-
stand the subject Why, sir, the subject is one
of common honesty, and I know he understands
that The subject is the exposure of corruption,
and, accordirg to the gentleman's argument, we
ought to put none on the committee but piofessed
rascals If he " who drives fat oxen must him-
self be fat," if the committee ought to be composed
of rogues, then I admit that the gentleman ought
to be excused But I ask the House whether he
should be excused on the ground upon which he
places it, that is want of capacity and ability'
The colleague of that gen leman [Mr Gray] has
given us a sort of left handed argument why he
[Mr Taylor] should be excused upon the ground
of incompetency Did any one ever assert that
the latter gentleman was incompetent to be on any
standing committee of this House' Would the
gentleman say that his colleague was incompe-
tent to do such duty' He was thought compe-
tent to be placed on a committee in relation to the
banks, a much more difficult subject of investiga-
tion than this, in which the honest man is more
needed than the lawyer We wanted a committee
of investigation, and we have got it, and we want
honest men to watch over the mterestsof the Ad-
mimstiation We have tried to get them Where
is the corps of reserve of which the gentleman
from New Yoik [Mi Gray] has spoken? We
did not know they had twenty men who were
superior to the rest of their party We thought
there was a more democratic equality among
them
Mr GRAY explained He had not stated (he
said) there were t*enty men who were superior.
He had said there were twelve, without having
made any calculation as to the actual number.
He presumed that there were more than that
number who would be considered competent to
serve He had remarked that this was a service
requiring qualifications of a peculiar character—
that a lawyer was better fitted to examine wit-
nesses than a physician I spoke of them not as
possessing the transcendent abilities of the Whig
side of the House, because I knew, if I said so,
that the statement would be disputed.
Mr PRDNTISS Well, then, let us have the
twelve fit men of whom the gentleman spoke.
Mr GRAY Before I could do that, it would
be necessary to have some consultation with the
friends of the party with whom I act. In saying
what I did, I spoke merely my own opinion.
Mr PRENTISS It is not merely the gentle-
man from New York [Mr. Taylor] who had
asked to be excused Three gentlemen yesterday
made the same request
Could there be a gentleman more fitted to serve
than the gentleman from Alabama, [Mr Martin']
I trust he will not decline, for he is a distinguished
lawyer, though, as I have said, I do not regaid
that as the best qualification I look upon it as
secondaiy We want honest, honorable, and
upright men And, in this point of view, I have
full confidence in all the gentlemen selected, espe-
cially the gentleman from New York, [Mr Tay-
lor ] I hope the House will not excuse him I
told you, the other day, that this matter would
turn out like the web of Penelope, that we should
unravel at night what we might weave m tne day.
This committee will have to deal with facts more
than with law, and for its purposes I would rather
have a farmer or a doctor than a lawyer We
gave you yesterday the ex attoiney of the State
of New Hampshue There, surely, you would
have had the best of law, but he declined to
serve I believe another gentleman, who was
also excused yesterday, [Mr Hobley,] is a sound
lawyer     What, then, do you want'
The other day, a gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia, [Mi Pry,] quoted from a speech of mine,
made in my own State, a passage in which I had
said that the party in power had no leaders of
distinguished ability m this House This was a
lash and unadvised assertion, and I now take it
back When I made tt, I had not heard the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania, besides, I hear from
