HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Gravelly Springs, Ala., March 10, 1865.

Brigadier General J. T. CROXTON,

Commanding First Division, Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: General Wilson wishes you to continue crossing your division as rapidly as possible, landing them at Chickasaw or Eastport, as is most convenient. If the division is separated it can be reunited before we march. Chickasaw will answer as well as Eastport. Horses have been promised, but it is impossible to say when they will arrive. Captain Wilson, the quartermaster of the cavalry depot at Edgefield, promised to send horses, and they are doubtless on the way.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. B. BEAUMONT,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, March 10, 1865.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

I propose to start on the 18th, or before, if my force all arrives. I now have force enough to protect the construction corps, and it can commence repairs. I would like to have the road repaired to Bull's Gap at once. The horses are arriving in very good condition, but we must get out in order to obtain long forage. Does Colonel Merrill report to me? If so, I would like to have him organize his brigade at once. Can't you come up before we leave?

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, Tenn., March 10, 1865.

Brigadier General DAVIS TILLSON,

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
