HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 12, 1862.

General BOYLE,

Louisville:

The impression exists at Washington that the impunity with which Morgan moved through Kentucky and committed depredations was due in many cases to the want of energy and good conduct on the part of officers.

I wish you to investigate and report on the matter, and name any officers whose conduct admits of such a charge. Report particularly with reference to the affair of the cavalry at Burkesville or Tompkinsville.

D. C. BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 12, 1862.

General BOYLE,

Louisville:

General Nelson thinks that Morgan has already crossed the Cumberland at Carthage and gone to Gallatin.

HEADQUARTERS,Huntsville, August 12, 1862.

General BOYLE,

Louisville:

Send a guard to Lawrenceburg, Ind., and arrest First Lieutenant John Breakey, Thirty-seventh Indiana Volunteers, a deserter, and send him under guard to Nashville, to be forwarded under guard from there to this place.

JAMES B. FRY,

Chief of Staff.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 12, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Morgan surprised Colonel Boone at Gallatin, Tenn.; captured his whole command and freight train. Not a man loss; not a gun fired. I have re-enforced Colonel Bruce at Bowling Green with Sixteenth Kentucky Regiment, and one gun of Thirteenth Indiana Battery will reach there to-night. Ordered Major Mansfield, with battalion of Fifty-fourth Indiana, from Bowling Green. If Governor Morton sends troops will re-enforce Munfordville in the morning.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, August 12, 1862.

General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Governor Tod was informed that the War Department had given no authority for requisitions on Ohio troops. Such authority has since been given to General Buell.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
