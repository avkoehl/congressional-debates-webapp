RICHMOND, VA., September 30, 1863.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Headquarters, near Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Your dispatch of yesterday received.* Am surprised at the statement of infantry force. Hope there is an error in the cipher. You have been advised of the re-enforcements en route to the enemy, and will appreciate the necessity for prompt action either against main body or detachments coming up.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN, September 30, 1863.

Captain MANNING:

There is a heavy volume of dust on the river road above Harrison's Landing, apparently moving down the river; also on the Anderson road. The enemy's lines on this side of the river are entirely obscured this a. m. by clouds of dust.

DUVALL,

Lieutenant.

(Via Chickamauga.)

JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President, Richmond, Va.:

There was probably no mistake in the cipher. Heavy losses resulting from a desperate and prolonged fight and heavy straggling from the re-enforcements have depleted us. The latter are coming up so that our force is increasing. It would be murderous to assault the enemy's superior forces in his intrenchments. Our efforts will be devoted to drawing him out.

(Received 3d.)

JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

My action in the case of Lieutenant-General Polk was only after the receipt of an unsatisfactory written explanation. The case is flagrant and but a repetition of the past. If restored by you to his command the amnesty should extend to all. In the crisis now upon us might he not be exchanged for Hardee? Our cause is at stake. Without vigorous action and prompt obedience cannot be saved. My personal feelings have been yielded to what I know to be the public good, and I suffer self-reproach for not having acted earlier.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

RACCOON MOUNTAIN, October 2, 1863.

Captain MANNING:

The enemy still cross the river. They are cutting cornstalks for forage. No apparent change otherwise.

W[ATSON].
