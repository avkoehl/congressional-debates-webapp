that the proposed shield be applied to the present battery, and that another be prepared for the battery at the northwest pan coupe.

The application of this armor will change a position the most insecure, and calculated to endure but a short cannonade, to one of comparative invulnerability, and by its very moral effect will act most powerfully upon the enemy in our favor. I am perfectly confident that this iron can be procured by vigorous and energetic measures.
