HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Louis, August 14, 1861.

Brigadier-General HURLBUT:

SIR: The arrest of Speaker McAfee has been approved by the general commanding and unless he not only pledges himself to keep the peace but will use all his influence in so doing in his immediate vicinity of country you will forward him to this place.

By order of General Pope:

[SPEED BUTLER,]

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Louis, August 14, 1861.

Brigadier-General HURLBUT.

SIR: In consequence of solemn pledges from a deputation of respectable citizens of Palmyra that peace will hereafter be kept in Marion County you are authorize to suspend the enforced contribution of supplies, &amp;c., levied upon that town and county. You will, however, keep the force now there at some point in the neighborhood carefully avoiding any outrages or excesses. Keep the troops in camp and punish any violation of the regulations in that respect. Lieutenant-Colonel Williams has left without your authority. Write him a severe letter on the subject or put charges against him. I wish the order published to your command forbidding any officer or soldier from leaving this district without leave of absence from these headquarters. No passes will hereafter be given on any railroad or steam-boat except to persons traveling on important public business.

By order of General Pope:

[SPEED BUTLER,]

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Louis, August 15, 1861.

Brigadier General S. A. HURLBUT.

SIR: I am instructed by the general commanding to acknowledge the receipt of your letter* of the 14th instant inclosing notice and to inform you that orders covering the entire ground were sent to you by yesterday's mail. If you think it necessary to adopt the same course in Shelby that has been pursued in Palmyra and Marion County you will do so and you will exercise your own discretion as to the length of time the troops will be kept there. The general commanding wishes the requirements of Special [General] Orders, Numbers 3, enforced in all cases.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[C. A. MORGAN,]

Aide-de-Camp.
