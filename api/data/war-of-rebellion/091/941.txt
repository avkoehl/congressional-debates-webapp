RICHMOND, VA., December 17, 1864.

General R. E. COLSTON,

Lynchburg, Va.:

I have no forces at command to send up. General Lee has been fully informed, and will, doubters adopt such measures of defense as circumstances allow.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

MARION, VA., December 17, 1864 - daybreak.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE:

The enemy left here two hours ago; my advance was upon their heels, but I had to stop to feed and await orders. If you had been here you could have made a good thing of it. The enemy's horses are worn out and men very tired. Men and officers say they are going to Lynchburg and are evacuating East Tennessee. My impression is that they will go through the Narrows. Their advance occupied Wytheville last night and represented that they had Vaughn stampeded and surrounded.

V. A. WITCHER,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

P. S. - I will pursue the enemy as rapidly as possible and will attack as soon as I come up.
