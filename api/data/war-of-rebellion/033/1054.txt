will supply him with such a quantity as you can spare for any part of your command. The number he will be able to transport is about three thousand.

I further beg that you will afford him every facility for the transportation of such arms as he may obtain to the Mississippi River, and, should circumstances demand, give him an escort sufficient to insure their safety. It is eminently important that these arms should be procured as near the Mississippi River as possible, in order that the least delay may be had in getting them here.

I would be glad if you would give Colonel Duncan the benefit of your views as to the best method of crossing the river, and at what point; and if I can be informed beforehand where you will send a force to protect the crossing on the Mississippi River, I will endeavor to have a cavalry force to meet them on this side.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

[HEADQUARTERS TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,]

Shreveport, La., November 1, 1863.

Lieutenant General T. H. HOLMES:

You must oppose the enemy with all the means at your disposal. If his superiority is too great for you to risk a general engagement, fall back, contesting every defensible point, and destroying as far as possible all supplies that might be made available by him. He must move slowly, and cannot advance far. Is it not practicable for your cavalry to operate on his communication and trains of supplies? Keep me constantly informed of the enemy's movements.

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Lieutenant-General.
