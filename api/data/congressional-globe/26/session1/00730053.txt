[Loud cries of "order, order," and "go en, go '
on," and much confusion throughout the hall ]
The CHAIR said that toe House was voting for
a Speaker, and f e gentleman's motion was n t m
order while that was going on.
Mr. MERCER said he rose to a point of order,
and demand d a decision < n it. I appeal, said he,
from the decision of the Chair.
Mr. WISE. Certainly my c 'Ite'gue has a right
to appeal from the decision of the Chair.
The CHAIR said he could not put the question
on this appeal while tne vote was being taken.
[Universal laughter.]
The Clerk was proceeding win the call,
whea
Mr. GRAVES interrupted him again, and ob-
served that he understood the g ntkman from Vir-
ginia as appealing from the decisión of the Chair.   •
Now he wtnil not yield the floor till the House
dec d-d that appeal.
[Loud cms of "order, ordT "}                              ,
The CHAIR called the gentleman to order, and
sud th-t he had decided that the appeal could not
be made while the Clerk was calling the roll.
Mr. GRAVES sad he could not consent that,    i
when an appeal was taken fn m the deci-m of the
Chair, the Clkrk should   contnue calling  the '
roll.
Mr. MERCER rose, and made a few remarks,
which, from the noise and confusion, and repeated
calls to order, it was impossible to hear.
Mr. WISE said, m frderto illustrate the pos- |
tion of my colleague, I will state that the Chair i
decides that he cannot put the question on his ap-
peal whi'e the   election is g in on.   Now, from
that very decision, my colcagae has a nght to
appea1.                                                                         ¡
The CHAIR said the motion of the gentleman   |
could be offered when a Ppealrer was chosen; but
he could not take an appea1 whi e the House was
m the act of e*ecting a Speaker.
Mr. WISE. Then here is a decís "on that an
appeal cannot be take*. Is it not competent f< r
my colleague to take an appeal from the decision^
The CHAIR. Certainly not, sir. [Lou 1 laugh-
ter.]
The CLERK was then suffered to proceed with ¡
the call of the roll; after which, the tellers reported '
the result of the second vote to be—                           I

Mr. MERCER then rose to a question of order.
The CHAIR said he wou'd now entertain the
question of order, it not having been in order to
receive it when it was first made, during the call
of the^roll.
Mr. MERCER stated that his object in doing so
was that he mieht move a recrms'deration of the
resolution of his col'eague, [Mr. Wise,] which had
been negatived on >e-terday by a tie vote. He
read the rule on the subject, and stated that a mo-
tion to reconsider was made by the ru'es, because
of s^me err r in the decision, and in th s case he
thought p esumption of error might be considered
as manifest, from the fact that the vote was equally
divided. Mr. M. concluded by moving to recon-
sider the vote by which Mr. Wise's resolution,
prov ding for the call of the New Jersey members,
had been rejer ted.
The CHAIR sail he considered the gent'emsn's
motion not to be in order, because, the vote having
been a tie vote, there was no majority in the case,
and the rule in 'he ca*e the Chair did not under-
stand as applying to this case. It was undoubtedly
in the power of the House, if they thought proper
to put ihat construction upon the rale, to recon«ider.
The rale iJ, whenever there was a vote taken, a
member who voted in the majority might move to
reconsider; but m the pre-ent case there was no
majority—there was a tie—an equal vote on boih
sides, and the question was declared to be lost, only
in consequence of the technical rule of the House.
There bem? no majority, the Chairman did not
feel him«elf at liberty to consideras in order ano-
ti-m made for reconsideration on either side of the
que  t ion.
Mr. MERCER appea'ed from this decision.
Mr. VANDERPOEL moved the previous ques-
tion on "he appeal, which was seconded unanimously
—the main question oidered, and the decision of
the Chair «u-.tamed—yeas 147, nays 84.
Mr. C H. WILLIAMS meved that the House
adjourn; but subsequently withdrew the motion.
Mr. UNDERWOOD leaewed the motion, but
the Honse refused to adjourn.
The House then proceeded to a thi'd ballot for
a Speaker, and ihe result being announced, it ap-
peared to be as follow:
