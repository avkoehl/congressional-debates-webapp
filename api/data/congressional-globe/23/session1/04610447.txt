THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
447
1 enefit 1 he B \"k of the United Spates was cl ar-
tereu forgieat public purposes,as an agentdeemed
necessaiy to the Federal Government, in the effi-
cient exerc se of its high prerogative, to fix the
value of money, and thereDy secure the benefits
ot !> sound circulating medium to tne Confede-
racy
It was designed to aid the Treasury Department,
to collect couveniei tly and disburse tne national
levenue Of its stock the United States hold seven
millions of dollars, and its notcts aie by hw made
rece vable, at par value, in payment of all due3 to
the Government Concede, as we must, that the
bank was established for great public ends, and
that the House ot Repiesentatives is the grand
inque t of the Union, and as such has power to
■visit and inspect all departments of the Federal
Goveinmen', to correct then abuses, reform their
er,ois,ard confine the c iercise of their pov/ers
within the limits prescribed by law to each, and
H follows that the House fies power to appoint a
committee to make a minute and full inquiiy into
all the multifoim opeiations of this powerful cor-
poration
Cut t mt thpre might be no doubt of the exist
ei ce of the powei here contended for, it has been
expre^s'y reserved m the23i section of thecharter
oi the bank, which provides "That it shall beat
'all i mes lawful for a committee of either House
'of Congress appointed for that purpose to inspect
' the books and examine into the proceedings of
'the coiporation heieby ere ted, and to report
' whether the provisions of its chaiter have been
' violated or not "
The larguage in which this authority of the
House is desci ibed is so plain and so full, that an
a tempt to illustrate it appears to be supeMe oga
tory The committee to be appointed aie to " in-
spect the books and examine into the proceedings
ot the corporation," without exception The sec-
tion contains no leseived power to the bank to
designate the place where or the persons in whose
piesence the examination shall be made These
modes of exercising the main power are necessa-
n'y, as us incidents, dependent on the discretion
ot the sovereign with whom it is loüged A con-
trary constiucuon would make eithei or both
Houses of Congress dependent o i the agents
whose conduct is to be tne subject of inspec-
tion
If the bank can attach any corditions to its ex
ercise not found in the chaiter, then it could íen-
dei nugatory the power by which it was intended
it should be checked and controlled That the
gieat conseivative purposes for which such com-
mittees ot investigation were to be appointed might
not be thus defeued, the extent ard chalactei of
the i inq mies aie rightly maue to depend on the
wisdom, patriot sm, and justice of either House of
Congress
The óriy íestriction to be found in that clause
of tne bank charter wl ich we are considering, is
that which relates to the committee, and not to the
House, and hasrefeience, not to the e\tentof the
examination, but to the chaiacter of the íeport to
be made The committee is directed to report,
amongst other things, " whether the provisions of
us charter have been violated oi not " The ob-
ject of this specific requirement is to be found in
another clause of the same section of the chaiter,
which piovides, "whenever any committee as
'aforesaid, shall find and repoit, or the President
'of the United States shall have reason to believe,
'that the charter has been violated, it may be
' lawful for Congress to direct, or the President to
'Older, a sc icfactas to be sued out of the circuit
'courtot the district of Pennsylvania, in thename
' of the United States, calling on the said corpora-
' tion to show cause wherefore the chaiter hereby
'gianted shall not be declared forfeited "
But it there ever had been a well founded doubt
as to the true and feir construction of this íeserved
powei of the House, the committee did suppose
it hi'been long since yielded
In 1318, Mi Spencei.of New York, offered to
the House of Repiesentatives a resolution provi-
ding for the appointment of a committee to inspect
'he°books, and examine into the proceedings of the
bank In the debate to which that lesolution gave
rise, the opinions now entertained by your com-
mittee weie well expressed by many distinguished
"etulemen     I'oi  piesentmg short extraéis fiom
one of the speeches then made, no apology, it is
supposed, will be needed Mr Lowndes said he
had no " app¡ehension of defect of power m the
' House to prosecute the inquiry in the terms pro
' posed He had no doubt of the power of the
' House, if the public interest required it, to duect
' a committee to make ¡>uch a report The nation
' (said he) has a deep interest in the conduct and
1 management of the bank, our duty to the people
' wnom we represent, the nation's interest, as
' owners of a large por ion of the stock, its mter-
' est in the íevenues beug wholly payable in the
' notes of the bank, will justify a constant and
' vigilant attention to its pi oceedings 1 f tliere had
' been a doubt uhether the conduct of th- lank had
' been proper or not, the House was fully justified
' in investigating into the facts, and mquinng whether
' abuses had been committed oi not He would vote
' for any inquiry in its broadest shape "
Theiesolutionof Mi Spencei was adopted, and
a committee appointed, who visited the puncipal
bank at Philadelphia, and some of its branches
They had free, unrestiamed access to the bocks
and papers of the bank They were furnished by
the offceis with such extracts and copies from the
books and papers as they called for They sum
moned befoiethem the dnectors and officers of the
bank, and examined them on oath touching their
conduct and proceedings And the committee made
to the House, on the 10th January, 1819, an elab-
oia>.areport,from which we learn that their inqui-
ries had beep chiefly diiected"ío¡/ieGENERAi man
agement of the bank and the conduct of its efficets "
1 he tiansactions of pnvate citizens with the bank
were then fieely and fully examined Individual
tiansactions of the president and directors of the
bank, m the purchase of its stock, were fully mves
tigated, and those officers sworn, and required to
testify before the committee Though deeply
affected, personally and officially, by these devel-
opments, tney nevei hesitated or objected to obey
the process, oi to give their testimony
The names of the bonowers from the bank
were published without scruple, wuh the amount
of money due fiom eaeh,whenevei, and not other-
wise, such a publication was deemed necessaiy to
illustrate the impioper conductor mal administra
tion of its officeis
This piecedent, to which the committee of 1832
strictly conformed, is entnled to high respect, fiom
the em'nent character of those by whom it was
estaolished, and who have justly enjeyed high
reputations lor puiity of purpose and distinguished
attainments
If any additional reason for deference to this
eontempoianeous construction of the twenty third
section of the chai ter be necessary, it may be found
in the fact, that the directors of the bank,m 1819,
themselves assented to it They conceded to the
committee of the House the right to inspect all
their books and papers, in such manner as that
committee thought just and proper Besides, those
who now have the management of the bank, in
1632, without question ot r.ght, without hesitation,
without protest, produced for the inspection of the
committee of the House, all their books, papers,
coirespondence,and accounts, and appeared when
summoned, and testified on oath touching the trans
actions of the institution under then control With
these preliminary observations, for which, it is
believed, ample apology, if any be requned, will
be found in the subsequent portion of this report,
the committee will proceed with a brief analysis
of their proceedings in the execution of the duty
devolved on them, showing the unexpected obsta
cíes interposed by the manageis of the bank to the
piogress of the examination, and their repeated
lefusa s, in violation of their charter, and in con-
tempt of the authority of the laws and of the
House of Representatives, to permit their books
or papéis to be inspected, or then proceedings to
be examined
The purposes for which your committee were
appointed, a-e sta'ed so distinctly in the resolution
of the House, that they have experienced no em-
barrassment in deciding on the character of the
duties imposed They were required, 1st, to ascer-
tain, if piacticable, the cau e of the commercial
embairassmeus and distress comolained of by
numeious citizens of the United States, in sundiy
memorials which have been presented to Congress
at the present session, and whether the bank has
had  any agency, through  its  management, or
money, in producing; the existing pressure.
2d To inquire whether the charter of the Bank
of the United States has been violated, and what
corruptions and abuses have existed in its man-
agement
3d To examine whether the bank has used its
corporate powei or money to control the press—
to interfere m politics, or influence elections.
The powers designed to be conferred on the
committee, if they could have been exercised, are
adequate to the performance of the duties enjoin-
ed, they were authorized to send for persons and
papers, to summon and examine witnesses on oath;
to visit, if necessary, the principal bank and its
branches, and to inspect the books, correspond-
ence, accounts, and other papers connected with
its management Such are the duties and tne
poweis of your committee, conferred on them by
the House with extraordinary unanimity, and
which your committee felt bound to regard, as
consistent with the chartered lights of the corpora-
tors and their debtors
Under a. deep sense of respectful obedience to
the decision of the House of Representatives thus
solemnly expressed, and feeling that they had no
right to question its justice or propriety, your
committee proceeded to Philadelphia on the 22d
of April, to commence the performance of their
duties
On the 23d of April their chairman addressed
to the president of the bank, a communication,
enclosing a copy of the resolution of the House of
Representatives, and notifying him of the readi-
ness of the committee to visit the bank on the en-
suing day, at any hour agreeable to him. In teply,
the piesident informed the committee that the pa-
pers thus received should be submitted to the board
of directors, ata special meeting to be called for
that purpose It appears, in the journal of the
proceedings of the committee, herewith presented
to the House, that this was done, and-that the
directors appointed a committee of seven of their
board, to receive the committee of the House of
Representatives, and to oftei for their inspection
such books and papers of the bank as may be
necessary to exhibit the proceedings of the cor-
poiation, according to the lequirement of the
chaitei In the letter of John Sergeant, Esq , as
chairman of the committee of directors, commu-
nicating the proceedings of the board, he says that
he was directed to inform the chairman of this
committee, ihatthe<¿ommitteeof thedirectors" will
immediately direct the necessary arrangements to
be made for the accommodation of the committee
of the House of Repiesentatives," and would
attend at the bank to receive them the next day,
at eleven o'clock. Your committee attended, and
were received by the committee of directors (Ap-
pendix A.)
Up to this peuod, nothing had occurred to jus-
tify the belief that a disposition was felt, on the
part of the managers of the bank, to embarrass the
proceedings of the committee, or have them con-
ducted differently from those of the two preceding
committees of investigation On assembling,
however, the next morning at the bank, they
found the room which had been offered for their
accommodation, pre occupied by the committee
of the board, with the president of the bank, as
an ex officio membei, claiming the right to "be
present at the investigations and examinations of
this committee This proceeding the committee*
were not prepared to expect. When the appoint-
ment of the committee of seven was first made,
it was supposed that that measure, however de-
signed, was not well calculated to facilitate the
examination
The officers of the bank were believed to be the
most appropriate agents of the board of directors
to exhibit their books and papers By them the
entries m the books are made, and by them such
entries are most readily explained It is their
duty, too, to be daily at the banking-house, and on
that account they could assist in the examination
more readily than the committee of directors
These objections to the special agents of the
board, were fel  and expressed, but they were
waived, and no disposition had been manifested or
felt by your committee to conduct the examina-
tion in any manner not entirely acceptable to the
board
