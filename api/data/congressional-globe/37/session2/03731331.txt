mi
Mr. POWELL.s I present resolutions of the
Legislature of Kentucky, relative to the proposed
tax oil tobacco, and ask that they be read.
The Secretaiy read them, as follows:
Resolutions in relation to the proposed tax on tobacco.
Whereas the congressional Committee of Ways and
Means have icpoited a hill to iaise internal revenue for the
siippoit ot Government and the payment of intciest on the
public debt, in winch leaf tobacco is taxed thiee cents per
pound, and all its manufacturer five cent-;, which bill is to
go into opeiation on the It-t ot May; and whereas it is com-
puted that at least seventy millions of pounds of tobacco
aie held in the State, which would be subject to taxation to
the amount of $2,101),000, lulling with great seventy upon
portions of oui State which aie sufteiin" from the present
war, and diseiimmating most pi cjudieially against the agri-
cultuial interests of the State: Therefore,
1 Resolved by the General Jlsscmblyofthe Commonwealth
of Kentucky, That the tax as proposed by the bill now pend-
ing in Congress is greatly disptopoitionate to the tax on
other piopeity, and ought to be induced.
2. Resolved, That owing to the great difference in the
value of different qualities and giades of tobacco, the tax
on it ought to be ad valorem, and not specific.

and oui Representatives lequested to act upon the matter
in accordance, with views picsented in these lesolutions.

"Piociann libcity throughout the land to ail the inhabit-

(l To the of the United States :
vkTho nndei-signed, citizens of Linn county, State of
Kansas, res-pecitully submit:
"That as the present formidable rebellion against the
General Government manifestly fmds its root and nourish-
ment in tho system of chattel slaveiy in the South ; as the
leading eon^pnators aie slaveholder, who constitute an
oligarchy avowedly hostile to all free institutions; and as, in
the nature <>f things, no solid peace can be mam tamed while
the cause of this treasonable levolt is peumtted to exist;
your honorable body is urgently imploied to lose no time in
enacting, under the war power, the total abolition of sla-
very throughout the counti >â€”Uncrating unconditionally ihe
slaves of all who are iobels,and. while not recognizing the
right of piopeity in man, allowing for the emancipated
slaves of such as aie loyal to the Government a fair pecu-
maiy awaui, in oidcr to laetbtate an amicablc adjustment
of difficulties; and thus to bring the war to a speedy and
beneficent tcimmation. and indissolubly to unite all sec-
tions and ail interests of the country upon the enduiing
basis of universal freedom."

Mr. GRIMES presented the memoiial of
Thomas Sundeiland, part owner of the rancho
Carmel, granted to William Knight by the Gov-

claimants to that tract may be permitted by act of
Congress to file a new petition in the United States
district com t for the northern district of California
for a confirmation of the title; which was referred
to the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. WILMOT. I present a memorial of the
Board of Trade of the city of Philadelphia, pray-
ing for a revision of the tax bill reported by the
Committee of Ways and Means of the House of
Representatives, with a view to a reduction of the
proposed tax on manufactures and other products
of industry. I move that the petition and accom-
panying1 report be printed.
Mr. GRIMES. It seems to me there is a ques-
tion involved in the printing of this paper that may
lead to the expenditure of a great deal of the con-
tingent fund, and I think it is not in accordance
with the rules of the Senate. I have no objection
to the printing of this pauicular paper; but there
is not an interest or a trade in the country that is
not going to petition us on tho subject, and if we
set the example of printing one petition we shall
have to follow it up bv punting all the others.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The question of
printing will be refeired to the Committee of Print-
ing under the rules of the Senate.
Mr. WILMOT. May not that be dispensed
with ?
The VICE PRESIDENT. By the unanimous
consent of the Senate it may.
Mr. WILMOT. 1 ask th e unanimous consent
of the Senate. If the Senator from Iowa objects,
of course it must be referred.
Mr. GRIMES. I do not object. I only want
to have some rule established for our guidance
hereafter. If we print one, we shall have to print
all.
Mr. WILMOT. This emanates from a very
respectable souiee, and is a very elaborate and
carefully piopared paper.
The VICE PRESLDENT. Does the Senator
fiorn Iowa withdraw his objection?
Mr. GRIMES. I shall only insist, if we are
to print this petition, that all similar petit' ons upon
the same subject shnll also be printed. With that
understanding, 1 withdraw the objection.
The VICE "PRESIDENT. That will be sub-
ject fo the single objection of any Senator under
the rule. The Choir hears no objection.
The motion to print was agreed to; and the
petition was referred to the Committee on Fmancc.

Mr. BROWNING. I move to postpone all

the construction of any railroads, or the comple-

part of which remained uncompleted at the time
