General E. KIRBY SMITH,

Commanding Confederate Forces, Shreveport, La.:

GENERAL: Your communications dated respectively May 30, June 1, 2, and 10, have been received.

General Price has written me that the two citizens, Hall and Aiken, mentioned in your letter of the 30th, have passed through his lines. The citizen by the name of Fred. Hamilton was relieved from custody on the 28th of May last, and I suppose is at his home.

When Gasterton, referred to in yours of the 1st of June, is received I will send you immediately an enlisted man in exchange. Any one that you may name that I have in my possession will have the preference.

It will afford me pleasure to pass Mrs. Sibley, daughter, and son through my lines on their way North.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FREDK. STEELE,

Major-General.
