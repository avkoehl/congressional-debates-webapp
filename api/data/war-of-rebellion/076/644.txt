RESACA, August 23, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have 410 muskets besides 100 cavalry. I can take the cavalry and, say, 200 infantry, and move out within an hour and see what can be done for the fellows near Holly Creek.

Colonel RAUM,Resaca;

Your force is too small to venture. Make sure of Resaca and wait General Steedman's action.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

RESACA, August 23, 1864-9 p .m.

Captain L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp;

The general's dispatch of 7.20 [6.30] p.m. overtook me on the way to Holly Creek. I think Resaca would have been safe. I have just returned. I will try to have 500 of the dismounted cavalry at Calhoun brought to this place so I can take the offensive, if necessary. The force near Holly Creek, whatever it may be, has made no offensive movements to-day.

G. B. RAUM,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

COMMANDING OFFICER,Resaca:

That bridge at Resaca must not be risked, but 300 men in the two redoubts can defend themselves and the bridge against all Wheeler's cavalry.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
