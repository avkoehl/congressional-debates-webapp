Statement of Peter J. Flynn, private, Company A, Third U. S. Volunteers.

I, Peter J. Flynn, private, Company A, Third U. S. Volunteers, having been duly sworn, do state that on the 18th day of May, 1865, while en route from Fort Leavenworth, Kans., to Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter., that I being one among a party of soldiers who were attacked by a body of Indians about two miles east of Elm Creek Station, Nebr. Ter., I was wounded in the face and back; also 2 of our men were cruelly murdered and 6 (including myself) wounded. Among the wounded was one John W. Twyman, COMPANY H, Third U. S. Volunteers, who was scalped. The Indians captured me and the chief, or one in charge, seemed very friendly toward me, and said that he was a Cheyenne chief. My opinion is they are Pawnees for this reason, when he released me and told me to go, and gave me an arrow, four crackers, and a canteen, and seemed very anxious to impress upon my mind that he was a Cheyenne chief. I think there was about twenty-five or thirty of the Indians. I could not say how they were dressed, except the chief, who was dressed in black velvet pants, with two rows of brass buttons down the outer seams. He also wore fancy beadwork moccasins and fancy beadwork cap, with a light-colored blanket thrown carelessly over him. His hair was cut short, so much so that I could not tell its color.

PETER J. FLYNN.

Sworn and subscribed to at Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter., before me this 5th day of June, 1865.

Statement of John W. Twyman, private, Company H, Third U. S. Volunteers.

I, John W. Twyman, private, Company H, Third U. S. Volunteers, having been duly sworn, do state that while en route from Fort Leavenworth, Kans., to Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter., on the 18th of May, 1865, when about two miles east of Elm Creek Station, Nebr. Ter., I was, among others, attacked by a party of Indians, numbering some fifteen or twenty, and 2 of our men killed and 6 (including myself) wounded. I was attacked by one of them with a U. S. saber, who struck me three times knocking me down. Then he returned to the party and another of them came to me and scalped me; then he hit me with his saber and left. They were dressed in buckskin clothing, so far as I could see, except the chief, or the one in charge, who was dressed in some kind of a light robe or blanket thrown over his shoulders. Two of them wore their hair short on both sides of their heads and "roached" up on top of their heads. I could not say how the rest of them wore their hair. My opinion is they were Pawnees, for the reason that they were so anxious to impress upon us they were Cheyennes. I think they did it in revenge for something, as they spoke of the whites breaking a treaty with them.

Sworn and subscribed to at Fort Kearny, Nebr. Ter., before me this 5th day of June, 1865.
