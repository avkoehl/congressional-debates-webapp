the Senate proceed to the consideration of the

Hp, and then my colleague will give way for
petitions, if there are more to be presented.
Mr. STOCKTON. If the Senate will hear
a statement of the object I have in view, I am
sure no one will object. This is a bill which
has passed Congress before, only slightly
altered. It has passed the Senate twice unan-
imously. It is a bill to erect a public building
at Trenton. It is reported by me from the
Committee on Public Buildings aud Grounds.
If the Senate will take it up now, I am sure
there will be no objection to its passage.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from New Jersey asks unanimous consent to
call up the bill for the erection of a public
building at Trenton, New Jersey. Is there
objection? The Chair hears none, and it is
before the Senate.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (S. No. 442)
supplementary to an act entitled "An act
to provide for a building suitable to the use of
the post office, the pension and revenue offi-
cers, and the judicial officers of the United
States, in the city of Trenton, New Jersey,"
approved March 3, 1871.
The Committee on Public Buildings and
Ground sreported the bill with an amendment,
to strike out the preamble and all after the
enacting clause of the bill, and to insert in lieu
thereof the following:

authorized, to be constructed at Trenton, New Jer-
sey, including the site thereof, bo, and the samo is
hereby, limited to the sum of $250,000; and $150,000 in
addition to the amount heretofore appropriated is
hereby appropriated for the purpose aforesaid out
of any money in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
priated: and the said building, instead of being con-
structed strictly lire-proof, shall have a fire-proof
vault extending to each story; and all money here-
tofore and hereby appropriated shall be expended
under the direction of the Secretary of the Treas-
ury, who shall causo proper plans and estimates to
be made, so that no expenditure shall be made or
authorized for the full completion of said building
beyond the amount heretofore and hereby appropri-
ated: Provided, That no money heretofore or hereby
appropriated shall be used or applied for the pur-
pose until a valid title to the land forthesite of such
building shall bo vested in the-United States, and
until the State shall also duly release and relinquish
to the United States the right to tax or in any way
assess said site, or the property of the United "States
that may be thereon, during the time that the United
fetates shall be or remain the owner thereof.
The amendment was agreed to.

amended, and the amendment was concurred
in. The bill was ordered to be engrossed for
a third reading, was read the third time, and
