CITY POINT, VA., March 26, 1865-10 p. m.

Major General GEORGE G. MEADE:

I made the changes to-day suggested in your dispatch of 4 p. m. in Ord's movement. Humphryes should, of course, leave pickets from Wright's left until their place is filled by Ord's troops. One regiment of cavalry, in addition to that with General Collis, had better be left to report to General Parke in case the Sixth Corps moves, and subject to your directions until it odes move. About 1,500 cavalry from Ord's command will be with the army.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Official returns from the several corps show the casualties of yesterday as follows:

 Killed	 Wounded	 Missing

Second Corps	 51	 462	 177

Sixth Corps	 47	 402	 30

Ninth Corps	 68	 337	 506

Total	 166	 1,201	 713

Or a grand total of 2,080, which is 80 larger than my approximate estimate of this morning. Of prisoners, the account now stands: Second Corps, 365; Sixth Corps, 469; Ninth Corps, 1,949; total, 2,783, or 13 less than reported last night. Of this number some 200 are wounded in our hospitals. It has been quiet along the lines to-day. Permission was granted the enemy on application to remove their dead and wounded, under a flag of truce, both on the Second and Sixth Corps fronts.

GEO. G MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, VA., March 26, 1865. (Received 11.20 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

Is the loss of the enemy in killed and wounded in front of the Second and Sixth Army Corps supposed to be as great as ours?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 26, 1865-11.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Humphryes estimates the enemy's losses in killed and wounded on his front as fully three times his, and I have no doubt
