Brigadier General E. P. ALEXANDER,

Chief of Artillery:

There is reason to think that the enemy is contemplating an advance. Kershaw's division is under orders to be in readiness to move down early in the morning. I have asked General Kershaw to give Colonel King the necessary notification. I would like to know by the returning courier what batteries you have with General Field and what which General Johnson.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Greeneville, Tenn., March 13, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

Brigadier General B. R. JOHNSON,

Commanding Division:

I am in receipt of the information sent by you, in relation to the recent movements of the enemy, together with your inquiry thereon; and in reply am directed to say in the event of Rucker's command being attacked, it will not be necessary for you to move your infantry to the gap. In the event of Colonel Rucker's being too strongly attacked to hold them, he must fall back on you to cover your front and the left flank of General Field. He must, however, hold the enemy in check long enough to give you timely notice. Your own position, the commanding general desires, should be such as to defend the crossings of Lick Creek, and to enable you to move to the support of General Field by the desires that you will hold yourself in readiness to make the movement to General Field's support whenever it may become necessary.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
