General Beauregard, who is directing Lieutenant-General Lee's troops, is authorized to use them as you may suggest. Can we not put on the road troops enough to protect all chief places on it? Please confer with General Beauregard.

General BRAGG,

Raleigh:

Brigadier General Bradley T. Johnson reports a raiding party at Lenoir; supposes it is Stoneman's, 4,000 strong. Can you command any troops to meet it? Where is General Martin's command, and how strong?

J. E. JOHNSTON.

RALEIGH, March 30, 1865.

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Smithfield:

General Martin is at Asheville, too remote to be used. The governor, on my application, has ordered the home guards and cadets. I have ordered a battery of artillery of General Hardee's reserve at Hillsborough; in all, not over 1,000. Telegraph office informs me General S. D. Lee is just passing Salisbury with his force. Might he not stop long enough to save that point?

BRAXTON BRAGG.

RALEIGH, March 30, 1865.

Colonel ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Smithfield:

I am informed by Mr. McRae, who saw them, that the enemy are advancing through Caldwell County at least 3,000 strong. Brigadier General J. G. Martin exercies a separate command in that district, and I do not know his means.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
