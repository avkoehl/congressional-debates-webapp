Making public officers depositories—Mr. Calhoun.
Oct, 1837,
H. of Reps.
selves, be correct, then it is obvious, that when, your money is
safely and cheaply deposite*!, you must look no ftuther, its-
effects «pon the banks, upon the currency, upon the general
■welfare, are events put beyond the scope of your puiposes or
your poweis, and are rejected by the fundamental -principie
Glwh'eh vour whole sybtem rests, viz that yeu have nothing
to do with the currency If it be your duty to i eject a safe and
cheap keeping of the public money because it will opeiatem
junously upon the banking system and the currency, then you
are bound to avoid any other measuie which is likely tn pio
duce that effect Your ihst proposition proceeds upon the
ground that the Government must take caie oí ltselt, and not
look to the right or left m doing so Your aecond proposition
proceeds on the opposite ground, viz that you must íegulate
your Treasury with a special view to the banks and the cur
rency Your plea for hard money is, that it is ¡safest for the
G jveinment—safety is your object, then keep your haid money
when you get it where it will be safe, but this you will not do
You will carry one part of your policy on the giound oí safety
of the Government, and the other en the ground of love of the
People
I have assumed, Mi President, that the custody of the public
moneys is safer in the hanks than in the hands of Executive
officers Does any man doubt it, or has -my one, even m the
fury of that tirade against banks, which constitu'es the staple
of every AelmmistraUon speech, ventured to say that the cus
tody of these, funds by the banks is not as perfectly safe as
moral and physical agency can make any thing? In the mida
of the general distress and insolvency which press upon the
country, 1 am not aware that any thing lias been lost, by your
confidence m the bank's, but, sir, if your enormous levenue
had been accumulated in the hands often thousand individuals
during the recent iige foi speculation and the con&equwtt
crash, where woul 1 your money have been "i The experience
of Ehe Government is conclusive It has trusted banks a thou
san 1 tunes more than individual agents, and has lost ahundred
tunes as much by individuals as by banks Why, su, in that
department of the Sub Tiea uty wj ich is to be conducted by
the postmasters, flieie are now, by a repon from the Poemas

filling the country with salaried agents of the Government,
wielding immense masses of money, ioi private or party pui
poses Geneial deposite in the banks, with the obvious dan
gers which I recognise as belonging to it, I do not think com-
parable to the enhancement of Executive puwei and danger to
the currency resulting from the Sub-Ti easury scheme But
there is an obvious mode of securing all the advantages I have
attributed to the custody of the levenue by the banks, and of
avoiding all the evilb which are  atd to be apprehended This
mode, sir, is to make special deposites in the State banks By
special deposites ¡s understood to be that deposite which the
bank receives to keep, and not to use for banking purposes, and
to íeturn the identical thing to the depositoi when drawn for
Foi tins speciesof custody, from which th bank derives no
benefit, some small lecompensemight be demanded, andgnen,
not amounting to an assignable fiaction of the cost of the Sub
Treasuiy By this means, the banks would do with the public
mon y precisely what the law vould impose upon the Sub
Treasurer, and which would be more hkbly to fulfil the law—
the bank or the individual* Wh'rh would the community trust?
Which would you, or I, or any body tiusfí The bank, by
possibility, might violate us obligations and commit a ftaud
Are vou safe m the hands of an jnderhng party intnsi pr, who

I shall, Mi President, as soon as it ia in order, move an
imendmentto the bill hefoie us, providing foi the special de
posites of the monev in the State hanks
Sir, it is said that bus Government should not en'ru^t it&me
ney to institutions ovei which it has no control The pro
position amounts to this that the Government has not power
enough over the banks to protect its own interest and yet m
th  same breath, itis contended that to allow th s. Government
to use those banks will endow it with a powei ovei ih°m dan
geious to the countiy The piopositions neutralize each

a bank in every village and hamlet, has a tendency to central

cal banking and commercial powei, you add the all absorbing

undisturbed force ofsingleness and identity, brings every thing

I cannot feut consider, Mr President, the policy proposed by
the Message as the very opposite of the txue policy of the Go
vernment We should íeform our system, not crush it, we
should deal with the circumstances around us, not attempt a
new creation We should not endeavor to effect an entire dis
ruption of the ties which bind up our financial destiny with that
ef the States and the people, but try to regulate them for mu-
tual benefit—try to make the banks subserve the just ends of
this Government, while they are permitted to perform what the
States created them for It is said that the experiment has
failed, andoughtnotto be again attempted Mr Piesident, the
great expenment which has failed is that which the country
has made with this Administration, that is the fatal experiment,
and that the disastrous failure; that is the experiment whi hit
is madnes-q to expect success from To check and contiol and
contradict and beat down this Admin is tratioa would effect more
for the country in producing the tiue remedy for its disaster
than any thing else that can be done The lemedy which
the case requires is confidence Restore confidence, and you
reinstate prospenty, conquer the Administration, and you re
store confidence All its principles of finance have been w rung,
violent, and ,>reposterou« All men of property distrust it and
its projects If the great object of the vengeance and acrimony oí
the Administration, if the revied and denounced Mi Bioldle
weie to day called to the head of the 11 ea-^ury, in the place oí
Mi Woodbury, it would in ten days add more than a hurdied
millions to the value of the property of the country, it would
loosen tho&e immense deposites now locked up in the hanks,
and send them abroad into the community, it would di&sipaie
like a cloud the gloom from men s mind* It would do all this1,
because the community has confidence m the wisdom integri
tv, and honor of that persecuted gentleman We need not ex
pect the happme^s of such a case a=> Í have supposed, but we
may, if we choose, revive confid nee by other mean1'—by our
moderation, by oui caution of enteungon new experiments,
by avoiding wai fare upon the moneyed institutions of the coun
try by showing that wp feel deep sympathy foi the sufferings

SPEECH OF MR. CALHOUN,
Op Massachusetts,
In the Ifouie of Rq  cstntaUves, Octobsi 19,1837—
On the bill imposing additional dnt>es, as deposi-
tónos m certain ca cs, on public officers.
Mr. CALHOUN, of Mass , rose and said • An
aitempt bad been made dm ng the ilm w ns of
this session to givp to the fu.an íal «5 st°ra of thi^
country a new character, an impression of noveitj,
an air of mystification. Gentlemen who had taken
a piomment part in the discussions in this haU and
elseAheichad spoken of an extraordinary cnsi-in
the monetaiy affans of the age, a development 01
principles hitheito unluioivn 01 in rcted upon, of
a «"TU financio] theorem or issue <f modem time--.
Tms pietension seems lo me (sa'd Ml C ) to be
an airo ant one, if honestly believed , and i* not, to
be intended sole'} to covd ovei some most singular
clui ges ot opinion Whatevej may be the truth
in th s iefaid, cerUmly these assumptions ha\e
then migm m an undue fondness for th°ori7mg and
speeulating. I have no antipithv to a spmt of this
land, if kept within p'oper bounls, and applied to
suitable objects. In al1 ihat can contribute to hu-
mp n happiness, or tnat mav tend .0 elevate the mass
of mankind, T ha^e t"c ¿Ironist sjmpa'hy wi h
those who arephilanthiopical'j engaged in pointing
o it a new and better way, and foi the abundantrea-
son that they are filing their thoughts to what, un-
foitunateh, docs not attract the universal or even
gen ial m'e'e't of our race
But in reference to subjects wh eh ar ofevei} day
concern which enter m'o the <onstant busines  of
existence, and which foim an e«enl al and promi-
r^nt feature m all the aims and objects of the in-
dustry of our countij, 1 cannot but 1 10k uron this
undue attachment to theory as a ->oie evil. TIip
s inject of finance ispecu'iarly practical,and minds
ot a piacl'cal cast are plmost the only ones that
mastei its details, and meet with success in its pur-
suit Whatever p rt ans to the finances of the
countiv, to its business and its cuireney, is better,
fir bettei, undeistrod by m°i whose lues are de-
\oted to that >>usi ess, b, men of k"ge and long-
eamtu expent ice, th > 1 b} iu\ mere poht cians,
however m^niouslj or adio/ly they mav theorize
And ce tun it is that in this country, and in every
country where civilization and intelligence have left
their mark, the wisest, profoundest, and most sue*
