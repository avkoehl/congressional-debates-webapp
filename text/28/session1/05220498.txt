Mr. CRITTENDEN presented a memorial from
Levi Nill and a large number of respectable citizens
of the commonwealth of Pennsylvania, setting forth
as the advantages of the tariff act of 1842, that it had
revived the business, and had given employment to
the labor and industry of the country; and praying
i hat no change may be made in its provisions until
experience had demonstrated, from ascertained
facts, that such change would be for the better.
Mr. C.. said he took particular satisfaction in pre-
senting the memorial to the Senate, concurring, as
he did, in sentiment with the memorialists, as to the
beneficial effects that law had had on the business
and industry of the country; that it had signally
Mfilled the brightest "aftd most sanguine anticipa-
tions of its friends and disappointed the predictions
of its opponents, as to the evils which it would in-
flict upon the people; that it had restored and re-
plenished an exhausted and ruined treasury; had
revived this commerce and business of the country;
had given encouragement to home industry, and
brought about prosperity every where. Under these
circumstances, and believihg that the law had
not been in operation long enough to enable them to
decide fairly upon its effects, and to discover its im-
perfections, it seemed to him utterly impolitic to
make a change in its provisions. He was for let-
ting it remain in existence long enough to furnish
them with one lesson of experience upon the sub-
ject, by which they might profit in future legisla-
tion. He did not intend, at that time, to make any
speech upon the subject, but to express his concur-
rence in the general sentiments expressed by the me-
morialists, and to add his own convictions that, from
a knowledge of the sentiments of senators, the me-
morialists, and country at large, might rest assured
that, at the present session of Congress, no repeal,
alteration, or modification, would be made in the
present tariff law. The memorial was then referred
to the Committee on Finance, and ordered to be
printed.
Mr. BUCHANAN presented nine memorials

to the Committee on Finance.

spectable citizens of the United States, without
having himself formed any opinion upon the sub-
ject. He was in favor of sending the inquiry to
the able Committee on the Judiciaryâbeing satis-

time to time, and printed by order.
Several adverse reports of the standing commit-
tees, on private claims, were taken up and concur-
red in.
THE TARIFFâCOMPROMISE ACT.
On motion by Mr, CHOATE, the previous or-
ders of the day were postponed, and the Senate re-
sumed the consideration of the resolution of the
Committee on Finance for the indefinite postpone-
ment of the bill introduced by Mr. McDuffie for
reducing the rate of duties tinder the present tariff to
the standard of the compromise act.
Mr. COLCtUITT addressed the Senate for two
hours; but owing to the rapidity of his manner and
the difficulty of hearing him distinctly in the re-
porters' gallery, all that can be attempted here is a
brief notice of some of his leading points of argu-
ment.
He set out with stating, after a few prefatory re-
marks, that he had yesterday sought and obtained
the floor immediately after his colleague [Mr. Ber-
rien] had concluded, with a view of intimating
thereby his intention of replying to him, and that
he might expect, in so doing, he (Mr. C.) would
have to contrast his [Mr. B.'s] former course on the
tariff policy with the course he now pursued on the
same subject. But he had learned this morning
that his colleague was absent; and that circumstance
would necessarily prescribe much narrower limits
to his observations than he should have indulged,
had his colleague chosen to be present. Indeed, in
his absence, it would seem to be unnecessary to
trespass on the courtesy of the senator from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr. ChoatlJ who had yielded the floor
to his colleague, [Mr. Berrien;] and he would not
now ask to avail himself of that courtesy, were it
not that he had, in the expectation of his colleague's
presence, collected some materials for reference,
which, while at hand, he wished to dispose of.
He then proceeded to examine the main topics
of t he speech of his colleague, [Mr. Berrien,] deliv-
ered yesterday; and to contract the sentiments
therein expressed on the subject of the present tariff,
with the sentiments and principles he had maintain-
ed upon the subject of former tariffs, not more odi-
ous to the South than this, and with the often de-
claied and still prevailing sentiments of the people
of Georgia.
In the course of his comments, Mr. C. denounced
the delusion and the inconsistency of his colleague's
doctrine, that the question of a protective tariff was
to be decided by the ensuing presidential election,
when, for the very purpose of promoting the elec-
tion of the favorite candidate of the protective party,
the issue was shunned and sought to be mystified,
by a call upon the representatives of the people to
waitâto pause for another year's experience; and
to let it be demonstrated whether it was a policy
that required modification or not. If (he urged) the
election of the father of the so-called American sys-
tem the presidency was relied upon with such con-
fidence as a test of the public voice in favor of the
present tariff, why did not the friends of that mea-
sure at once boldly take- their stand upon that
