25th Cong--"2nd Si ss                                Mi. Calhoun's Resolutions—fir. Crittenden.                                                          Senate,
cry "all's well," when I believe there is danger—
when I know there is an enemy m motion, profes-
sing and claiming to be influenced by considera-
tions and governed by motives above and be)ond
the Constitution and laws of my country, and that
enemy likely to be sustained by an alliance with
party politics No,sir, Re have no concealments
upon this subject All we deraanv! is, that since
we are to be the frst to feel the effects ot Aboh ion
ascendancy at home, shoal! v never be acquired,
(which, by the way, I by no me ins anticipate,) we
may meet the question tmemb massed, an 1 rot be
driven by any course here upon a collate) al iss le,
such as the right oí petition, or any rther Tne
force of this suggestion will be more fully appte-
headed alter the remarks which I am about to
make
It is not to be disguised tint, from an insignifi-
cant beginning, and with comparatively fev  even
now, who hold what are generally considered abo-
lition sentiments, this subject is assuming an aspect
of fearful interest and momentous conseq tence
The Senatorfiom Alabama on my left, (Mr Kino,)
in my judgment, pointed, at an early day of the
session, to the true cause of alarm, if any exist    It
was this that religious fanat cism no longer mov es
alone in this matter that the misguided enthusiast
has joined hands with the designing politician   Sir,
I re'er to it with reluctance    I have no party pur-
poses to answer    I shoul X be unworthy of a seat
here, and unworthy of the confidence that has been
leposed in me by an honest, intelligent and pa-
triotic people, if I could indulge my thins; like
partisan feelings on an occasion like this    No, sir
no, sn      I believe th s question may, and I believe
it is the only question that can  lead to a diss >lu-
t on of this Union, and I hav e but one object  that
is, to guard   igainst it,  to preserve mvi >!at" tie
public faith and the provisions of the Coist tution
under which we have  so long lived m prosperity
The  Abolitionists, it is well known,   long since
avowed  their determination to make this the t st
question in elections, and I have seen, with pro
found regiet, that m one St tie at least same of the
prominent individuals of both pa-ties have sub-
mitted to their catecnims    Let those who doubt
that the politic ans in Connecticut and New Hamp-
shne are making use of Abolition for party par-
pose-., w nh a view  to  the approaching ele * ons,
notice the ton° of il > poluicil ucuspapets Men.

were made the subject of speu 1 k erenct and re-

wnat is now demanded''    Why, not onlj that you
shall receive petitions, but that you shall tile a
particular course with them, which is in accordance
with the views of these gentlemei, who, not satis
fied with the exercise of their own lights, assume
the pierogative of sitting m judgment, and deter
mmmg what are your duties
The coincidence upon this point between one
portion of the political piess in New Ens'and and
the abolition press proper, just at present, is trulv
remarkable the same sentiments, the same argu-
ments, tne same opprobious epithets applied to the
members of bo A Houses of Congress from that
section of the Union, who oppose any action upon
this subject Tor instance, the delegation m the
other House from the State whieh I have the ho-
nor ffl pait, to represent here, are charged by the
Abolition press with having denied the right of pe-
tition, and the same thing is reiterated by the poli-
tical press, m the face of their votes upon the direct
question during the present session    It is notorious
that the quest on of receiving petitions upon this
subject has been taken in both Houses, and decide!
affirmatively by overwhelm ng majorities, and yet
there is a persevering and sj stematic attempt on
the part of the political as well as the abolition
presa to give the impression that the right of peti-
tion is denied I have already detained the Senate
longer than I intended, and will not pursue the
■subject further than to add, that he has turned over
the pages of history to little purpose, who would
net regard with unqualified horror the connection
of religious b golry with political power, and to
w arn gentlemen on all sides to frown upon the first
man f< stations of a disposition to connect the poli-
tics of the day with that spirit of fanaticism which,
u ider th  pretence of promoting the cause of civil
hbertj, would trample m th< dust our glorio *
Constitution adopted in a spirit of compromise and
concession, and in the exercise of that spirit alone
to be maintained
Mr CRITTENDEN, of Kentuckj, rose He
said that, if the object of these resolutions was to
produce peace and allay excitement, it appeared to
him that they were not very likely to accomplish
suca ^n object More v?gue and general abstrac-
tions than ihef were could hardly have been
brought forwaid, and ¡hey were more calculated to
produce agitation, ana stir up discontent and bad
blood, than to di any good whatever Such he
knew was the general opinion of Southern men,
few of whom, however they assented to the ab-
stractions approved of this method of agitating the
subject Mr C was quite at a loss to comprehend
w h it gor d such res >lvttions could effect, there was
nothing practical in them they were in the air,
aerial, unbuvmess-hke, theoretical abstraction ,
< n1/ "alcalá ed to ?gitate and to hung the rights
ot the S uth to trial, to bring ihem up for discus-
sion, 1i urate diflerence and discord on abstract
question  among thosp who all agreed on the one
practical point, viz that the rights of the South
must be nreserv ed He (Mr C) would not say
that they were the work of Abolitionism, but of this
h<* w as certain, that such a mode of bringing the
South to trial, and putting up her rights to be dis-
puted, by drawing out theories on which no two
m n could absolutely agree, v as most eminently
calcula ci to aid, and no doubt would greatly aid,
tV A boh tonists The mover of these resolutions
relies mainly upon two points to carry the Senate
with hi i first, he reiterates, over and over again,
the trite theme and crv of ' danger to the Union,"
and next, tiat, if he is not follow el in this move-
ment he urges the mevitab'e consequence of the
"debtiaction of the Urion "
Mr C thought it p issib'e the gentleman might
be mistal en It possibly might not be exactly true
that, ti save the Union, it was necessary to follow
him Oa the contmv, some were ofopmon, anl
he for one was much inclined tobe of the same
view, th->t, to f >llow the distmgu shed movei of
tnese resolutions, to pursue the course ot irritation,
agitano 1 and intimidan in vich he chalked out,
woul i h the veiy best and sunst method that
coul 1 Le chalked oat to destroy this great and
happy Union The Senatoi (Mr Caihoun) is
daily, and almost twenty times a day, telling us
that the disease ¡s great—is ter ible—is frightful—
1' absolutely incurable' But, if it be as he repre-
sent , if the disease be incurable, why does he
come forward as a phi s cia 1 to heal a disease which
he himseif decíales to us is past a'l healing' What
cai possibly be the object of the resolution*, if the
ev 1 they propose to assuage is past all cure' What
was the use of bringing tbpm forward if th  gen
tleman is sincere in *hml mg that no application
can be of any benefit to a disease « h eh he pain s
every hour of the day as hem? frightfully removed
from all the powers of remedy' Is such language
on the other hand, only intended asa politic methtd
of carrying by force and terror and alarm e\ ery
tiembhng vote in his train' Wnatever might be
the object of the gentleman, it certaml} appeared
rather strange to him (Mr CRirrFNoris) that he
should bung forward his resolutions as a remtd\,
pnd descant most forcibly upon their healing, test-
ing, curing, and sanatoi >> powers, and almost m
the same breath tell us that the disease is so feai-
ful, so far gone, so alarming, so terrific, that his
very remedy which he offers is good for nothing1
So far it appeared to Mr C that Mr Calhoun's
course was not calculated to heal, or to produce
peace, though such he professed were his objects.
There was again another argument on which he
rested, which also appeared to Mr. Gritte 1-
pen calculated to produce confidence m the .Abo-
litionists, and alarm 111 the South, and alHhe
fnends of the South, calculated, he thought, if it
were not exposed and avoided, tojadd thickly to the
ranks of Abolitionism, and to weaken the ranks
of the South, by forcing out many of its warmest
and most ardent friends and supporters. The argu-
ment was—though not of course so plainly and
openly expressed—that there could be no confi-
dence in any opposition to Abolitionism, unless it
came from Mr Calhoun and his party1 unless it
came from the State rights party' And, therefore,
the neeessary consequence which follows is, that
unless the whole country shall follow the gentle-
man, and range themselves behind him in his par-
ty, there can be no preservation of the Union,
there can be no available opposition to Abolition-
ism' Such a mode of acting and reasoning upon
(he subject appeared to Mr C as making a stalk-
ing horse, a tool, of Abolitionism, to serve as a
mean, and as an instrument of promoting personal
views and party ambition, under the pretence of
infinite good to the country
He (Mr C ) adtrured the ingenuity exhibited by
all this, he did not complan of the genius aad ta-
lent which could convert a danger and an evil to
its. own purposes but he should complain of, or
rather pity, all, if any, who might be led to an-
swer this end by the alarms and terrors thrown
out' Yes, if what the gentleman says be true, we
must all join his new friends and party, or—the
country is ruined, all is ruined, the Union will pe-
rish, Abolitionism will rear its frightful head in.
horrid triumph' There 11 no possibibty of escap-
ing all these dreadful horrors but by joining him
and his new friends and party' We may give the
South our good wishes, nay, we may be resolved
to stand by the South, and die for its rights and
our rights, but it will all be in vain, unless we
join the gentleman and his party1 What is the
effect of aíl this? What is this but saying to the
Abolitionists "go on, go on, all ism 3 our favor, do not
calculate on any-opposition but from me and the
State rights party'" Such a course and such de-
clarations may well create a just and solid ground
of alarm to the South' What' are there no friends
to the South hut the gentleman and his little party'
Is it left so weak, so helpless, so friendless, as to
hav e no friends, no sympathy no supporters jn the
whole country, but the gentleman himselt and his
little State rights party' Is there no other banner
displayed' Is there no other banner under which
its friends must arrange themselves, but the tatter-
ed shattered, ragged rag of the flag of this little
Sttte rights party' But what is this party for
which such vast preponderance is claimed, wkteh
takes to itself such exclusive powers, and calls fot
such unqualified allegiance and submission' What
are its principles' What has it done' For the
life of him he could not ted' If he knew any thing
of himself an I hi  o«n principles, he was a State
rights man himself, staunch and true, for he would
notal'ow his own State (Kentucky) to be encroach-
ed upon one foot If principle made him one, h 
w as one of tms party, but if to follow the gentle
man from South Carolina, (Mr Calhodv) was all
that made one, he was quite sure that he (Mr C )
was not, and woul 1 not ever (m that sense) be one
But because he did not follow m the gentleman's
party, was he, therefore an AboHhonisf This was,
however, the inference which he (\tr Calhonv)
had taken upon himself to draw Like the Saint
in Hudibras who might commit any sin with im-
punity, on account of his great piety, so here, «well
is the virtue of a political name, that whoever e -
lists under the banner, is free from all imputation,
•nrhile all the sins that can be imputed to man are
laid upon the shoulders of those v ho do not fall
into the privileged ranks of the immaculate party1
