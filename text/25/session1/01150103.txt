in the first section the word?, "rot bear ng inte-
rest "
Mr HOLSEY opposed the amendment on the
ground that it was necessary to vest thatdi-cie-
tionary power m the Pies dent and Secretaiy of the
Treasury, to psefent the contingency that might
arise of the i becoming below par The clause
vesting that discretionary powei m the Treasury
Depaitment, would pievent that contingency
Mr McKIM expressed his decided approbation
of the proposition to pay interest, because it would
prevent the note? be ngdepicciated below par, and
the Government being bound by existing laws to
pay its «editors in specie, it would not be just to
offer them merely piper m liquidation of its debts
He was, however, in favoi of a moderate rate of
interest, perhaps six per cent at first, bin that rate
might hereiftei be reduced, even to as low as one
percent That, however, would depend upon a
variety of circumstances, such as the future condi-
tion and wants of the Tieasury, the amount of im-
port": the negotiability of the Treasury notes, their
demand, &c Without mteiest they might at once
become depreciated, as it was within his recollec-
tion they did m the late war no less than ten pel
cent The time might come wh<m they need not
bear any interest, but that was not the present mo-
ment
Mr KeK objecle 1 to a lempoiary loan for a
year, fiom the dimcu'ty thcie would be of nego-
tiating it for so short a period That was one ob-
jection. He had several others which he Mould
not then go into He also said that he would not,
at that time, go farther into the subject generally,
but he trusted the clause piovidmgfor the payment
of interest, under the restrictions devised, would be
agreed to
The question was then taken on Mr Rivrs'3
amendment, ind it was deci'ed m the negative—
ayes 56 nres 91
Mi UNDERWOOD then sib Tutted hi  amend-
ment, notice of which he had given before, as
above, which was rejected—ayes 80, noes 91
Mr DUNN moved to amend by inserting a
clause making the Treasury notes receivable in
payment of debts due to Government, from the
sales of public land , custom-house dues, and ba-
lances from the deposite banks, whether suchTrea-
sniy notes should be due at the time or not He
said his object in offering the amendment was,
that if the notes depreciated in value, it «as right
to call into the market as many purchasers as pos-
sible
Mr CAMBRELENG objected to the -intend-
ment The object of the bill «as to issue 'he no'es,
and to receive 'hem in payment of merchants'
bonds, and other debts, when such notes became
due, and not befoie, and to prevent any deprec ation
in their value
Mr ROBERTSON could not agree with the
proposed amendment, which if carried, woul 1 af-
ford an opportunity to the United States Bank to
pay off uV whole of its d°bt by bu} mg up the notes
at a discount He did not like the idea of debts
due to Government Demg pa'd m advance by such
a method
Mr FILLMORE thou0ht the merchants ought
to be allowed to purchase the Treasury notes, and
to pay their boads with tnem when they became
due  whethei the notes were due at the time or not
Mi DUNN *i d his object n offeimsrthe amend
ment was, to pre\ ent the notes depreciat ng as
much as poss ble
Mr CAMBRELENG saw no a Haulage in
adootmg the am ndeient It was quite time enough
for the merchants to p i} the no'es into the Trea-
sury when they became due
Mr CHAMBERS made «one obseu ations in
which he endeavored to show that the p esent mea-
sures were parts of a scheme to destroj the banks
He concluded by mo-i mg ' d at the bill br hid
aside fm the present, ind that the Senate bill No
4, for adjusting the remaining claims against the
deposite banks, be taken up instead "
After some debate as to whether such a proposi-
tion could be received at that lime, the Chan de-
cided it was in order
The question was then taken on the amendment
and lost without a count
Mr WISE moved to strike out the words "he
may think proper," and toinseit "the exigencies
oí ti e Government may require " Also to strike
out " and shall include the principal of each note,
and the interest which may be due thereon at time
oí payment," and insert " provided that it sh ill not
be lawful tor any officer of Government to pay out
or circulate Tieasury notes, so long as there shall
remain on hand any specie or other available
funds, and the whole amount of th° five millions,
provided by law for contingencies, shall be kept
on hand in Treasury notes, until their use shall
become unnecessary," &c
Mr W said it was not his intention to give his
views at large at that time on the Treasury note
bill But he considered it as the commencement
of the system of a Treasury bank It was never
contemplated by the administration, in adopting
their system of Treasury banks, to present the en-
tire plan at once It was their intention to de-
velope it gradually, and to give it to the people by
piecemeal The first and the longest stride to fa-
miliarize the minds of the people, was their Tiea-
sury issuis The plea now urged for these notes,
with or without mteiest, was "the necessity of the
Government " And pot onl\ that, but it had been
openly avowed by a gentleman in the odier House,
'that Government should have a peimanent circu-
lation " He, Mr W was not onlv opposed to the
"reation of a public debt without necessity, but he
nould the  state in advance and enter his protest
against the Treasury bank scheme He thought
his fuend from Pennsylvania (Mi Bidd'c,) in his
able speech in the morning, in one instance h?d
mistaken the figure That gen leman had thiown
out the idea "that the Government of the United
States had violently and nrehsiouslv fo-ced a di-
v oice from the United States Bank, wh ch was )'s
lawful wife, and had been united in wedlock for
foity vears, that the Government, Tnrklike, had
thea set up a seiagho, but getting sick of that, h^d
taken a number of harlots, whom it petted and
dandled on its knee m the most indecent manner "
Now he would tell the gentleman that he certainly
had mistaken the whole figure Whence had we
this doctrine of divorce? Why, it was first suggested
by Fanny Wright, (andhe should very likely have to
quote from her writings before long) it was' from
her that the idea originated, but shortly after he had
read her book denouncing matrimony, and crying
up divorce, the very first thing that he saw was, that
Fanny Wright had become Mrs Darusmont, and
had actuall} got married herself, aft°r abusing
matrimony in such trong terms Jus^gjp it was
with the Government, it was crying up the doctrine
of divorce, when at the same time it was about con-
tracting matrimony with one of the vilest terma-
gants, in the shape of a Treasury bank
The question on this amendment was then taken,
and rejected—ayes 82, noes 89
Mr CAMBRELENG'S amendment or substi-
tute for the bill, was then put and agreed to
Mr DUNN moved to amend by adding an addi-
tional section to the bill, limning the power of the
Secretar} to ismib notes, to the first Monday in May,
1838     Rejected without a count
Mr FILMORE moved to «trike out that portion
of the bill relating to punishment for forgery, mak-
ing it penal to have in possession the same kind of
paper, &c and to n sert " With intent to use the
same fraudulently "    Negatived wiihout   a count
The question was then tal en on Mr Dunm's for-
mer amendment, and lost w ithout a count
Mr JOHNSON, of Mary'and, moved to amend
bj adding " the powei given to the Presi lent to
iss e Treasury notes shall cease on the sec nd
Monday in June, 1839 " He said his object in
offering the amendment was to ascer am whethei
this bill was onl> intended to give piesent relief, or
whether it was to be permanent fot all time to
come and that GoVernme it intended to cover the
whole country in future w th its ow n spui ious paper
Mr DUNCAN compla ned of the many occa-
sions on which the fnends of the adr-imstration
w ere compelled to sit and listen to the taunts of the
oppos tion, who were continual!} charging them
with being under Executiv e influence, and so forth
He would admit that they acted toge he>-, and w hat
of that11   The friends of the Govei nment had eome

here for the very purpose of acting t aether, to re-
lieve the country from its present di tress. But
the opposition were continually raising the panic
note, and } et did nothing tow ards rehet. They not
only refuse to act themselves, but they endeavored
to embarrass and prevent others from so doing.
Was- it not but the other day, that one who claims
to be a leadei of the other side, (Mr. Wise) told
them " that he would ofier nothing, and he hoped
that none of the opposition would offer any propo-
sition for relief!" Mr H then referred to the va-
rious measures now propo ed, and contended that
they were all calculated to afford relief to the banks
and country at large He referred to the short pe-
riod remaining of the session, and earnestly en-
treated the opposition, that if they would not act
themselves, at least to permit others to aet for the
. benefit of the people.
The question was then taken on the amendment
offered by Mr Johnson, and rejected—«yes 8%
noes 89
Mr GRENNEL submitted an amendmeHt in
relation to the clause for punishing those having
nlates of the notes m their possession, with intent
to make a fraudulent use of them    ho*l.

mittee then rose, and reported the bill and amend-
ments to the House, which were ordered to be

man,
