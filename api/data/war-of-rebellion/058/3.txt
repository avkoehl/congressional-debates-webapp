UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.

KNOXVILLE, TENN.,

January 1, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I arrived here yesterday morning. Send forward all the supplies for General Foster with as little delay as possible, and clothing particularly. Keep a careful watch on the river between Chickamauga and the Hiwassee, to prevent interference with the steam-boats.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

STRAWBERRY PLAINS,

January 1, 1864-11.45 p.m.

General FOSTER:

Your dispatch directing me to send a division to Dandridge just received. I have one brigade now with General Sturgis, the other of that division at work on redoubts on the other side of river. General Hascall's division in on this side. The only means of crossing is one frail ferry-boat, and by this means it will require at least three days to cross the division. When over the river, I am at a loss to know how to provision it, and when it reaches Dandridge the difficulty is as great, if not greater, as the Twenty-third Corps is as yet without supply train. My troops are now distributed from Buffalo Creek to this point, and reports come in to-night that no more forage or subsistence is to be had in the country. The roads are now almost impassable. I will, however, order Hascall's division to commence the movement to-morrow, but I should prefer waiting until we had a bridge of some kind constructed here, in order that its supplies might be secured to it. The division on the other side of the river now can be moved at once to Dandridge, provided they can be provisioned. The pontoons have arrived. I have no balks or chess. I expect to have a party at work to-morrow on the rope for lashings and cable.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
