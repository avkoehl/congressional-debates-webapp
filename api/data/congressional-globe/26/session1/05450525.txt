Consistently with the demands upon the revenue' He would
not say that He held that, with the wealth and great
re«ourie«ot the country, we s'iould make our revenue equal
to ihu demand Wantot funds should hereafter be regarded
as no good excuse lor neglecting delem.es universally admitted
to be indispensable tor the honoi and safety of our country If
the curieut revenue was not sufficient lor these and other objects
ol like magnitude and nec«ssuy, let articles of luxury and or
nament,such as wines and silks, which are annually imported
and corsumetl in the country, be taxed to raise the means The
i avy ol Great Britain const ted at present of five mindied and
fifijen ships ind tweuty three steamers, and mounted more
than twenty two thousand guns Farnce two hundred and thirty
ships, America lii'y t*o in all, and thirty ciuht effective,
moun ing only three thousand guns Now the least with which
we should be satisfied in oui nawilarmament, was an increase
at the lowest of fifty per cent in the mean time, we should
provueforan organization of the milina, to be efficient and
umlorm throughout the United States
Thus prepared, with our large cities in a suitable state of
delence, and with six huidred thousand disciplined citizen sol-
diers, so enrollad and organized as to admit of being promptly
mustered and called into the field, we 3hould be ready for that
which, under such cucumstances, would hardly be pressed
upon us.
He would not be understood as admitting for a moment, that
we would not, even unprepared as we now were, expel in a ut-
ile tune any invader that should venture to set foot upon our
soil He entertained not a doubt of it, because the «ame spirit
that in 1793 prompted the celebrated decree of the French Con
vention, which proclaimed t íat—
'From the present moment, till that when all the enemies
sha mare been driven lrom the tcrntory of the Republic, all
Frenchmen shall be in permanent readiness for the service of
the armies, the young men shall march to the coutest the mar
ried men forse urns and transport the provisions, the women
shall make tents and clothes, and wait in the hospitals, the
children shall make lint of o d 1 nen, the old men shall cause
themselves tobe carried to the public squares to excite the
courage of the warriors, and preach hatred against the enemies
of the Republic, the battalions, which shall be organized in
every district, shall be ranged under a banner with this inscrip-
tion   'The French nation risen against tyrants ' "
The spirit which rendered that people invincible, and crowned
their arms with eu.ha succession of splendid victories over
the veteran troops of the allied powers, as astounded the ci
vfltzed world, would animate our countrymen from one ex
tremity of the Union totheoher, bu„ leteveiyman consider
what dreadful sacrifices must precede the final result, if war
come upon us in oui present delencele<33 state While our
cmzens were taking their places under the folds of the banner
which the Repub ic would ihrow over them- a slow process at
best for want of organization—our.g.. lant little army, to which
the country looked wuh pride and coefidence, would be sacn
flced, the blood of our most vaiuab e cunrens would perhaps
stain the pavements of their Oivn streets, and more property be
destroyed in one commercial cuy, than would now defray the
en ire expense of oerfect protection and security This, Mr P.
sail, was what might happen, and was that against which mo-
derate patriotism and ordinary prudence should provide He
indulged the hope that whenthi storm ot politics shocld have
passed away, the Senate would take the subject up in the
spirit and with the enlarged views of statesmen, acting for the
common interest of their common country
Mr PRESTON remaro.ed tha* he thought our system of for
tifications had been commenced on too gigantic a scale They
ouibtto have been completed at less expense than had been al-
ready laid out upon them And those wmen were completed
were so large that it was difficult to man them
Our whole inland frontier ousht to be regarded as not needing
fortifications We were there, every where, m the attitude to
invade, ai J not to be invaded, for we could there, in any case
inflict tenfold more on an enemy than they could on us And'
there wasanother consideration which ought tolm c more weight
than had been heretofore given it in relation to our defences, and
it was this we were not a corquerln  nation, and were not to be
conquered The country was absolutely and intrinsically mcapa.
bleof being conquered The whole question, therefore, in re a-
tion to our defences, was a question ol annoyancee, and on that
pri' i,ile, and on that alone, the v hole system of our defences
ouilit to be projected and arranged We Bhould have merely
pot its u'afpui, to retreat to and rtfit
Mr P proceeded to remark that an entire revolution was row
going on. n regard bo'h to lnlard and mantime defence, by the
ageitcy of steam Railroal  would enab'e large masses of
troops to be thrown suddenly on any point of the country that
might he assai ed A still g-eaierre/olu ion was going on upon
he sea, so that forts, he thought, would be soon rendered unne-
cessary, an' the strupg'e must be maintained in the open sea
The great cfficulty would be the want of men in our navy, arid
he thought it would be our p. cy always to have as many sh , -i
as could be manned V> c ough to have a power to redress a
wro igs, wherever given, promptly on ti e spot, m all parts of
the world.
Mr P urged this subject further, with much earnestness, and
declared the present state of our defences to be deplorably defi
cient, beyond the knowledge and the belief of most of the mem
hers of Con Tre«"
Mr  CALHOUN said all these subjects must "ome up in their
order at the next session, and ho should therefore not enlarge
upon them now    He thought our present s\b em of fortifica
tiors had been so far extended as to make us cautious in our
future expenditures and he hoped that spirit would govern in
our appropriations the present session    Ojr system of fortifi
cations and other defences would of cr urse require to be changed,
there must be great changes both in ilie art and the armament of
war, and the attention of Corgiees ought to be directed especial
ly to the navy in both its branches—that propelled ly steam as
well as mat by wind    This arm of o'ir oa tonal offence «hould
receive the mo t kindly attentions of Government, and could not
be r°ele"te<3 wi'l impunity

RETROCESSION OF ATEXANDRIA AND GEORGE
TOWN
Mr WALKER submitted a resolution instructing the Com
mittee for the District of Columbia to inquire into the expedi-
ency ofretroceding all those portions of the District of Co'umbia
not within the limits of the city of Washington to the respective
States to which they formerly belonged
The resolution, by cepsent, was at once considered.
Mr CLAY of Alabama said he would rather instruct the
committee to bring in a bill at once authorizing the retrocession,
with the consent ot Alexandria and Georgetown, and the States
respectively.
Mr MERRICK said it would 1 e recollected that Georgetown
had formerly petiuoned Congress to be restored to Maryland.
Alexandria had not done so, but had recently expressed a una
nimous wish to be restored to Virginia Mr M was sure that
Maryland would be glat to r coive Georgetown. But he
thought it altogether too late m the e =<uon to introduce a mea-
sure of this kind, which evtden ty could not be cairied through.
At the proper time Mr M would be glad to act upon it
Mr PRESTON argued that, even if the measure ceuld not
be consummated at this time, it was expedient to brine the sub-
ject undei consideration, and he was therefore in favor of the
resolution
Mr MERRICK said he was in favor of the retrocession, and
he should not further object to a resolution of mquliy
Mr CLAY ot Alabama said there were but two points to be
aaceitained in this matter, one, the consent of the people to be
retroceded, and the othei, the consent of the States to receive
them He thought, theiefore, that a p.ovisionary bill might
readily be passed at this session, which would tequire no fur-
ther action of Congress
Mr LUMPKIN, as a member of the C i i.t,ee for the Dis
trict of Columbia, concurred in giuntinsr a retiocession But
if a bill for that purpose was row to be frame 1, he proposed
that it shouid be done by a select ci    mittee
Mr WALKER said that the pimit e- for the District were
better acquainted with this si b em thin a select committee
could ha, and he wished the in y tu be n ide by those best
able to make it He argued i i lave r of the retiocession, that it
would lighten the duties, and sho ici the sessions of Congress,
andhebelieveditwouldbefor the good of all the parties con-
cerned
Mr MERRICK said he was anx'ous that the retrocession
should take place, and il it should not be carried at tins session,
he should move upon it early in the next
Mr ALLEN spoke in favor of the bill, even if it should not
now be passed, as it would more effectual'y call the attention
of the parties to the subject, and of the |_eo¡ le of the country.
The resolution was agreed to without di- tnt
On motion of Mr WRIGHT,n was resolved that the Senate
on this day, and for theremairder of the session, takea recess
from half past two to half past lour o clock
