Brigadier General W. T. WOFFORD,

Commanding Division:

The enemy's cavalry is still on the south side of the French Broad, and it will be unsafe for your wagons to forage across the French Broad or Chucky until it has been driven away. The commanding general desires, therefore, that you will detain any of your trains that may be on the way, and send out no more in that direction until you hear further from me.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,
