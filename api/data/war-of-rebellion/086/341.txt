by choice. Major-General Rosecrans has been ordered to pursue him as far as his troops can follow. He should not be allowed to get back by any route through Arkansas or within your reach. Any troops that you may use for this purpose will be replaced on the Arkansas and White Rivers by troops from other points. I send up to-night one brigade additional, infantry, from Morganza to be used in Arkansas or to prevent the crossing of the Mississippi.

LITTLE ROCK, October 31, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

GENERAL: A train of thirty-five wagons from Price's army crossed at Dardanelle on the 20th. On the 23rd about fifty men from the Third Arkansas Cavalry and some loyal citizens attacked the rebel escort, killed 15, wounded others, and drove the rest into the mountain, capturing 35 wagons, 200 horses, and $11,000 in money. Seven hundred of our troops from Fort Smith came up just as the affair was over. We are watching Price's movements closely. I have both infantry and cavalry en route for Fort Smith now. General Thayer has order to draw in his outposts and all public property to Fort Smith before Price can reach them, in case he should come that way. I think he is so hard pushed by Rosecrans that he will go west of Fort Smith. Our cavalry from Pine Bluff has a sharp skirmish with Logan on the Little Rock road day before yesterday with success. no official reports received. I will send you a summary of operations for the month. Several escaped prisoners from Tyler, Tex., have just come in. They were assisted off by deserters who have not yet got in. It is reported that rebel cavalry is moving from Red River country toward Camden; also that Magruder is about to move with his whole force against my line. He has materially strengthened the fortifications at Camden. A cavalry scouting party just returned from north side of White River. They had a skirmish; killed 3, captured 15 prisoners and 73 head of horses and mules.
