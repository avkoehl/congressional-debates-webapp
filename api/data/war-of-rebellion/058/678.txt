at Clinton. General Lee will remain on the west side of the Pearl River to operate on the flanks and rear of the enemy, unless your order him to the contrary. I hope you will guard your crossings. Lee has covered Canton. Will telegraph your intentions to General Polk. I hope you will let General Lee remain west of the river.

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.

JACKSON, MISS.,

February 5, 1864 - 3 p. m.

General S. D. LEE:

GENERAL: Your note is received. I concur with you in your remaining on west side of the Pearl River. I have not moved my infantry yet from the other side, but will go to-night toward Brandon. I am telegraphing Loring to fortify at his crossings, so that when re-enforced we can all return to the west side and operate with you. His crossings are important and should be held, especially if the enemy should not advance from here. Some corn will be left here for you, and the bridge will be sent, if possible, as you suggested, to Major Smylie. Another brigade will reach me to-morrow.

Yours, truly,

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.

I am just telegraphing Loring, at Madison Station, what you write.

JACKSON, February 5, 1864.

General LEE:

Do you wish General Loring to destroy his pontoons where he crossed?

S. G. FRENCH,

Major-General.

[General S. G. FRENCH:]

GENERAL: I do not wish the bridge destroyed, as it is probable I will desire to send most of my wagons across Pearl River. Ask the general to leave a guard at it and to inform me before it is.

Yours, &amp; c.,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
