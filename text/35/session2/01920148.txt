THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 20,
whole army at Detroit, with all its officers and
armament had surrendered, when your now Sec-
retary of State was a prisoner of war, then the
militia of Ohio and Kentucky took up the defense
of the frontier, and they did not surrender. I say
they did not surrender. They met the enemy,
and the enemy were beaten back by them, whea
they had in their own possession your whole reg-
ular Army.
[The committee informally rose; and the House
received a message from the Senate, by Asbury
Dickins, their Secretary, informing the 'flouse
that the Senate had passed a resolution providing1
that when the two Houses adjourn on the 23d
instant, they adjourn to meet on Tuesday, the 4th
of January next; in which he was directed to ask
the concurrence of the House.]
Mr. NICHOLS. I did not hear the amend-
ment which was offered by my colleague, [Mr.
Giddings,] but I wish to say, in response to his
remarks, that at least one member of this House
has met this bill upon principle; and that one,
myself, is willing to meet it upon principle. My
colleague's white hairs may appeal to me, as a
yoking man, to vote a pension to men who, like
him, have rendered services in the war of 1812.
I acknowledge the force of that appeal; I acknowl-
edge it as strongly as any man in this House; for
I am, sir, when at home, surrounded by men who,
like my colleague, rendered such services.
But I put another question to him now. I ask j
him—and I appeal to the history of the country '
to answer—if rewards have not followed those
services as sure as the sunshine follows the night?
My colleague is a living witness of that fact. He,
sir, served early.
Mr. GIDDINGS. The gentleman does not
understand my position, if he thinks we are seek-
ing for dollars and cents. It is the pride of the
soldier that stimulates us to ask a recollection and
acknowledgment of those services.
Mr. NICHOLS. I understand the force of that
appeal also, i understand it to be the pride of
the soldier; but I ask him whether, since he has
been a member of this body, the Government has
not twice acknowledged that service in a most
bountiful manner ?
One word as to the reward I spoke of. What
has followed ? I will tell you. The men who ren-
dered distinguished services to their country in
the war of 1812, where are they? My colleague
himself is a living example of tho gratitude of the
American people. Twenty years of service upon
this floor, is a tribute of the giautudc of the
American people, though I acknowledge that his
position here may be partially attributed to the
distinguished civil service he has rendered his
country.
Now, I cannot consent to support the principle
of this bill, or of any such bill, for 1 believe the
whole system has been carried loo far. Our stat-
ute books are covered all over with examples of
legislation fur the benefit of those who have
served, for their widows and their oiphans, and
for the benefit of the heirs of those who were
shun in battle; and I am unwilling to carry the
principle any further. Gentlemen have said they
do m t care what the condition of the Treasury is.
i yi\y, I do not care. If it be bankrupt, let it be
ho; if it be overflowing, still I will not vote for
the pnnciples of this bill. And I now send up
M>me extracts from the report of the Secretary of
the Interior, showing where this thing is going
to, and what its end must inevitably be.

dt i ulnrh the allowance is made. The disability may haie

£? anted.
" With a view of showing the impossibility of nniving in
advance at any reasonable conception of the expenditures
which will be required by a pension law, I wiii )efer >ou
tu the history of the passage of two euaetmenib, one c!
1832, and the other of1853, occurring more than twenty years
apart.
'' On the 7th of June, 3832, forty-nine years after the close
of the revolutionary war, ' an act supplementary to the act
for the relief of certain surviving officers and soldiers of the
Revolution' was passed. While that bill was under con-
sideration, a committee of the House of Representatives
went into an elaborate calculation in order to ascertain the
number of persons then living who were embraced by us
provisions, and the annual amount of money it would re-
quire. The conclusion was, that the number of soldiers
who would claim and be entitled to its benefits was 10,057,
and that the annual expendituie would be $907,608. On
this calculation the bill was passed. The number of claims
filed under the Jaw during the fiist year was about 25,000.
The whole number filed undent exceeds 38,600. The whole
number admitted was 33.414.
" The whole amount expended for pensions in the year
1831, was $1,281,679 71. lnM833, it was $5,100,203 97.
The increase caused by the act of June 7, 1832, was, there-
fore, $3,815,524 26, more than four times as much as the
committee estimated the bill would lequire.
" It fuither estimated by the committee that, at the
end of seveu yeais, fifty-five years after the warof the Rev-
olution, there would be none surviving to leeeiVeits bene-
fits. Now, if the whole number, 10,057, which it was sup-
posed would receive pensions under this law, hud lived out
the seven yeais, it would have required $-6,253 226 to have
met its entire requiiements, according to the calculation of
the committee. But this, of cour&e, was not anticipated,
inasmuch as they expected that the whole tiumberof bene-
ficiaries would have passed away withm the seven years.
It is fair then to presume that one half of this amount,
§3,17b,613. was all that was expected to be drawn fiorn the
Trea^uiy under its piovitoons. Twenty-fix years have
elapsed since the passage of that law, and about two hun-
dred soldiers are yet on the rolls, mid the gioss amount ex-
pended under the act is now over eighteen mtUion d"ilars.
<• On the passage of the act of Febinary 3, 1853, gi anting
pensions to the widows of revolutionary soldiers mariied
subsequent to 1800, the estimate ot the office was," that
{5j24,OUO would be sufficient for the first year. Thar amount,
however, was found whollv inadequate, and the additional
Miin of §200,000 was a.-ked for, and nppropnated in the de-
ficiency bill of the succeeding session for that puipo^e."
Now, Mr. Chairman, let us look at the scope
of this bill. "What does it propose? Togivepen-
sions to the privates of the regular Army, militia,
or volunteers who served three months in the war
with Gieat Britain, declared on the 18th day of
June, 18J2; and to the officers, pensions accord-
ing to their grade, not exceeding the pay of a lieu-
tenant colonel. And in the case of the death of
the person who served, then the pension goes to
those who are nigh of kin—his wiiow or children.
This is the basis of the bounty-hind acts of 1847
and 1850; and we are told by the fiiends of this
bill but fifteen thousand persons are entitled to its
benefiu. This will not do, sir. Why? Let us
see.
In 1855, on the 26th of February, the pension
office reported to this House that there were issued
under the acts of September 28, 1850, one hun-
dred and twelve thousand one hundred and fifteen
forty-acre land warrants, fifty-eight thousand nine
hundred and eighty eighty-acre land warrants,
and the number of one hundred and sixty acre
land warrants arc not repotted. Let gentlemen
pause before they enter upon a field the boundaries
of which are so illy defined. Where is the sys-
tem to end J
Mr. BURNETT. I believe the motion which
I propose to make is parliamentary. 1 desire that
this measure shall soon be disposed of in some
way. I suppose it will not be necessary for me
to speak of zeal for the passage of this bill. The
gentleman from Alabama [Mr. Cobb] claims to
be a great friend of this bill, and seems exceed-
ingly anxious notonly for the soldiers of the war
of 1812, but for those engaged in all wais subse-
quent to that time. I must be permuted to say
to him upon this occasion, that his zeal for the
bill is beyond his knowledge. I mustbe permit-
ted to say to gentlemen who claim to be friends of
this measure, that, if they understand the senti-
ments of this House, they will agree with me
that the numerous amendments proposed to be
put upon this bill, and the numerous amendments
voted for by the opponents of this bill, must en-
sure its defeat in the House. I do not doubt that
gentlemen who have offered amendments have
done so in good faith; but, sir, when those amend-
ments arc adopted, who vote for them? Gentle-
men of this House who are opposed to the pas-
sage of any bill for the benefit of the soldiers of
the warof 1812. That fact has been shown by
every vote which has been taken by tellers. Now,
I hope that the friends of this measure—those
who have been m good faith struggling for a pen-
sion for the soldiers of the war ot 1812, will vote
for the bill with only such modifications as are
absolutely demanded, and recommended by the
Committee on Invalid Pensions. The bill was
reported unanimously by that committee. There
are one or two amendments which, in my judg-
ment, would be advisable; yet 1 ara still willing
to take the bill as it stands, if I cannot have it
made to suit my own peculiar views.
I now move.to strike out the enacting clause o
the bill, with a view of having the bill reported
to the House.
Mr. GARTRELL. I hope the gentleman wil
not press his motion at this time. I have an
amendment which I wish to offer and have voted
upon by the committee before that motiofi is
pressed.
Mr. BURNETT. I would like to yield, to th#
gentleman; but we have had this debate going on
at the last session and the present session, day
after day, and there certainly can be no more light
she4 upon it. I am satisfied that the friends^pf
this measure will give the* gentleman an. oppor-
tunity to offer his amendment in the House, and
therefore I must insist upon my motion.
Mr. SHERMAN, of Ohio. 1 desire to offer
an amendment to the second section before that
motion is made, and 1 hope I may have an op-
portunity of doing so.
Mr. JEWETT. I appeal to the gentleman to
withdraw (he motion.
Mr. BURNETT. I withdraw it for the pres-
ent; but shall renew it soon, if I can obtain the
floor.
The question being upon the amendment of the
gentleman from Ohio,
Mr. GIDDINGS withdrew the same, there
being no objection.
Mr. CURRY. What is the pending proposi-
tion?
The CHAIRMAN. The amendment of the
gentleman from Alabama, [Mr. Cobb.]
Mr. CURRY. Is it in order for me to make
a speech of five minutes in opposition to it ?
The CHAIRMAN. Debate has been ex-
hausted on the amendment.
Mr. CURRY. Then 1 move to include tl the
Creek and Cherokee disturbances."
Mr. Chairman, I conceived it to be my duty at
the last session to oppose this bill, and m my
speech 1 presented a certain table, or rather con-
clusions drawn from that table, showing the
amount involved in this pension bill, as calculated
by the Commissioner of Pensions, to be some-
thing like eleven million dollars per annum. That
table having to some extent been called into ques-
tion, 1 have procured an additional table from the
Commissioner of Pensions, which is as follows:

Of course, sir, this estimate must necessarily,
to some extent, be conjectural. I will read, how-
ever, an extract from the Commissioner's letter,
explaining the table:

various acts of Congress, it appear that 279,920 out of the
