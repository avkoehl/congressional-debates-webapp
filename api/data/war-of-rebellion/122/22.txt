and distribution of arms for the last year, and also the condition of the forts, arsenals, &amp;c., with power to send for persons and papers.

Believing that the exigencies of the service require that the information asked for should be furnished to the House with the least possible delay, with the view to the early initiation of such measures as the information asked for may require, you will oblige me by furnishing me at your earliest leisure the names of such witnesses in your Department as will furnish the desired information. You will also please advise me what has been done, or what orders have been given, with the view to the protection of the public property in Charleston and in Charleston Harbor.

Very respectfully, yours, &c.,

B. STANTON,

Chairman Committee on Military Affairs.
