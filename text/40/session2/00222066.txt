THE COTOEESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 21.
It is a fact which should not be overlooked
that the treaty made October 1, 1859. ratified
July 9, 1860, between the United States and
the confederated tribes of Sacs and Foxes of
the Mississippi, and under which more lands
were sold than under any other, has never been
published with the volumes of public laws, and
was, therefore, comparatively unknown to the
people.
Now, sir, if the public lands of the United
States occupied by Indian tribes can be sold in
pursuance of treaties like this, without consult-
ing the law-making power of the Government,
it is high time it should be known, in order that
some proper remedy may be applied. This
nation has never admitted that any Indian tribe
ever had any title to the lands in their occu-
pancy, and consequently no power of sale was
ever conceded to them. No tribe ever could
make a treaty with or sell the lands in their
occupancy to any foreign nation, or even to
private citizens of the United States. The
writers on public law all agree as to this, and
:-io citation of authorities is necessary. These
treaties under which sales have been made to
private individuals assert the novel, dangerous,
and, as it seems to ine, unwarranted right to
divest the titleof the United States simply by
the authority of the President and Senate. I
deny that there exists in this Government any
such power as is asserted in these treaties, and
I will at the proper time introduce the resolu-
tion just submitted, in order that the subject
of which it treats may be considered and that
this House may assert its rights over the public
lands.
The treaty-making power is not defined by
the Constitution. It is treated as a power
already known, defined, and recognized, and
limitations are thrown around it by the Con-
stitution. Subject to these limitations it is as
ample as was the treaty-making power in
England when the Constitution was adopted.
There "the sovereign power quo ad hoc is
vested in the king. Whatever contracts he
engages in no other power in the kingdom can
legally delay, resist, or annul." (1 Black-
stone, 257.) And Blackstone says that minis-
ters are impeachable if from criminal motives
they advise an improper treaty. In this country
the power is limited as to the authority to
make treaties by devolving it on the President
and Senate. But all treaties are declared to
be the supreme law. It has been maintained,
therefore, with great force, that the treaty-
making power is competent to execute itself
even by the appropiiation of money from the
Treasury—that such appropriation is a law
within atticle one, section eight, clause twelve,
of the Constitution. It was so declared—
"By William Pinckney. of Maryland, in 1810, in the
House of Representatives, and supported by one ot
his most elaborate and able speeches. The speech
may be found in Williston's 'Eloquence ol the Uin-
ted States,' vol. 3, page 2I3L'*—X CV"artt/i,103; 1 Wuuh.
(J. 61 It. 322; 1 Paine, (35.
The action of the Government, however, has
been different from this from Jay's treaty to
this hour. And it has been said:
"The discussion of the appropriation forthattreaty
was an undisputed admission ol the right of the House
to act. The occasion was worth the error, for it gave
birth to that magnificent oration of Fisher Ames,
which, in honor ot American literature, will be read
in future ages in company with the oration of De-
mosthenes for the crown."
But as the Constitution, in article one, com-
mits the whole subject of raising revenue to
Congress, a treaty requiring the payment of
money to execute it cannot of its own force be
carried into effect so far as the payment is con-
cerned, unless, indeed, money shall be found
in the Treasury unappropriated by act of Con-
gress or shall so come in. (Paschal's Anno-
tated Constitution,, 175; 2Peters, 314; 3Dallas,
276; Story on Constitution, sec. 1508; 4 Hall's
Law Journal, 461; 6 Wheat., 161; 1 Kent,
165, 284; Spalding's speech, House of Repre-
sentatives, December 19, 1867.)
A treaty with an Indian tribe cannot dis-
pose of public lands, and the reason is plain.
I have already remarked that the title to the
public domain within the boundaries of the
United States, though there be an occupancy
by Indians, is nevertheless in the Government.
The Indians never did and never could have any
title but only a right of occupancy. (J ohnson
vs. Mcintosh, 8 Wheat., 548 ; Clark vs. Smith,
13 Peters, 195.)
And the power to dispose of the public lands
is expressly reserved to Congress by the Con-
stitution. (Art. 4, sec. 3, clause 2; United
States vs. Rogers, 4 Howard, 067; American
Insurance Company vs. Cauter. 1 Peters, 542;
19 Howard, 395, 633.)
A power which is reserved to Congress ex-
clusively cannot be exercised under any author-
ity purporting to be conferred by treaty.
The authorities which explain and illustrate
the treaty-making power have been collected
by the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr.
Butler,] and I present them, so that they
may be before the House for the proper under-
standing of the land titles purporting to have
been created under treaties with the Indian
tribes.
The treaty-making power was discussed in
the national convention which framed the Con-
stitution in 1787, as follows : May 29, 5 Eliot's
Debates, 127, 181; June 13, ibid., 190; June
15, ibid., 192; June 18, ibid., 209 ; June 20,
ibid., 245; July 17, ibid., 322, 375; August 0,
ibid., 379; August 7, ibid., 382, 383; August
15, ibid., 427, 428, 467, 469, 470; August 25,
ibid., 478; August 27, ibid., 483 ; September
4, ibid., 507; September 7, ibid., 522, 523,
524; September 8, ibid.
It was discussed in the Virginia convention,
June 18, 1788. (3 Eliot's Debates, 496, 511,
510, (560.)
It was said by Mr. Madison that "if the
President got up a treaty by surprise he would
be impeached."
It was discussed in the North Carolina con-
vention, July 28, 1788,(3 Eliot, 115, 132,245;)

Mr. Speaker, the objection to these Indian
treaties is twofold; first, as to the asserted power
to dispose of the public lands; .and second, the
fact that lands have been sold in large tracts,
thus creating vast monopolies and subverting
the homestead policy of the Government. And
while upon this subject I desire to say, as I have
often before said, that land monopoly is a great,
and, I fear, a growing evil. Let me state some
facts to prove this.
The Government, since its organization, has
sold lands amounting to over 154,000,000 acres.
Of the lands sold, there remain in private
hands, not reduced to occupancy as farms,
over 30,000,000 acres.
The Government grants of lands to western
and southern States, to aid in constructing
railroads, amount to over 57,000,000 acres.
The grants to aid in the construction of
canals amount to over 17,000,000 acres.
The grants to different lines of Pacific rail-
road companies, 124,000,000 acres.
The amount of land granted and to be granted
to the States under the act of Congress of July
2, 1802, to aid iu the establishment of agricul-
tural colleges, reaches (Laws of 1862, p. 504)
9,600,000 acres.
The lands granted to the States under dif-
ferent acts of Congress as "swamp and over-
flowed lands,'- amount to 43,000,000 acres.
(See Julian's speech, House of Representa-
tives, March 0, 1868.)
This subject is further illustrated by letters
which I have received from the Commissioner
of the General Land Office, as follows:
Department op the Interior,
General Land Office, February 0, 1803.
Sill: I have had the honor to receive your letter
of this date, and in reply have to refer you to tho In-
dian ollice lor the information tuerein requested as
to the lands fn Indian reservations sold to indi-
viduals or companies within the last three years. In
answer to your second inquiry 1 have to state that
the selections in place for agricultural colleges
under the act of July 2,18o2, amounted on the 3Uth
Juno, 1867, to one million ono hundred and fifty-nine
thousand four hundred and ninety-nine acres, and
tho scrip issued under tile same law to non-public-
land-holding States, amounts to live million three
hundred and forty thousand acres, which is exclusive
of two hundred and seventy thousand acres issued to
North Carolina, and tho location thereof prohibited
under the joint resolution of March 29, 1867.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOS. 8. WILSON, Commissioner.
Hon. William Lawrence, House of ltepresentatmes.
Depuitment of the Interior,
General Land Office, February 8,1863.
Sik: I had the honor this morning to receive your
letter dated tho Gth instant, and in reply to your first
and second inquiries have to state that the quantity
of land inuring under grants by act of Congress tor
railroad purposes is estimated at 181,588,581 acres,
exclusive ot 8,225,413 acres granted for wagou roads,
and up to the 30th of June last there were certified
to the proper beneficiaries a fraction over twenty-
one millions. (See Annual Report ol October 15,
18G7.)
In reply to your third inquiry I havo to state that
the quantity of public land which remained unsold
and unappropriated in the States and Territories on
the 30th of Juno lust, including 369,529,600 acres,
as the area of the American purchase from Russia,
was   1,414,067,574 acres.
The area, surveyed on ttie 30th
June, 1807, was  485,311,778 acres.
Of the aforesaid surveyed area the
area undisposed of was  64,8S0,952 acres.
1 havo no data for forming a judgment of the prob-
able amount of arable land not surveyed.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JOS. S. WILSON, Commissioner.
Hon. William Lawrence, House of Representatives.
It was to remedy some of the evils ol land
monopoly thatl deemed it my duty, on the 20th
of January, to introduce a bill which is now
pending, as follows:
A bill to secure to actual settlers the right to pur-
chase lands hereafter granted to railway and other
companies.
he it enaeted by the Senate and House of liepresenta-
tives of the United States of America til Congressassem-
bled, That all lands which may hereafter be granted
to railway or other companies to aid in the construc-
tion of railways or other works, whether under ex-
isting law or laws hereafter enacted, shall be sold by
suchgrantees only to actual settlers in quantities not
greater than one half section to any oneperson.and
at a price not exceeding fel £) per acre, with interest
at six per cent, per annum from the date of the
grant to such company; and the Secretary ot the
Interior shall have power to prescribe rules and regu-
lations for carrying this act into eifect; and 110 person
shall be deemed an actual settler who docs nut fur-
nish evidence in such form as the Secretary ol the
Interior may prescribe, .thatit is his or her intention
to enter upon, nnpiove, and reside upon the lands he
or she may purchase as and for a homestead.
The Committee on Public Lands subse-
quently reported a bill designed to remedy the
same evils, which is as follows:
A bill to regulate the disposition of lands tlist may
be hereafter granted to aid in the construction of
railways.
