APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL yGLOBE.

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury— Mr. Wright.
Senate.
demands upon it for the current >e¡¡r, and that,
therefore, a provision by law for fu< iher means,
within the year, has become índtpsnsable
Secend. That there js an existing public debt so
large that, without over-burdening commerce and
the resources of the country, it cannot be paid off
and discharged m a shorter period than from five
to eight years, and, therefore, it ought to be perma-
nently funded for eight years, and on y to be paid
at the pleasure of the Government afier the expi-
ration of that time
Third. Tbat an increase of the current levenuet
are necessary to meet ihe current ex, enses of the
Government, and the interest of the rxistn g debt,
and that additional taxes ought to be imposed, m
the shape of a duty of twenty per cent, upon almost
all thosearticle* which are now imported fieetrom
duty; and he estimates the amount per annum to
be realized to the Treasury from such new taxation
at from six to eight millions of dollars.
Fourth That, if Congress impose th «-e new
taxes and fund the debt, as suggested, the reve-
nues from the public lands, estimated by him nt the
rate of three millions of dollars for the present year,
will be subject to any disposiuon Ccnc;ress may
choose to make of them, independent of the wants
of the National Treasury.
To reach '.he Secretary's facts, he would follow
him very much in the order in whir1! he had set
them forlh in the report, and his conclusions and
the financial recommendations he had based upon
them should be tried almost entirely by the facts
there found
The Secretary then tells us that when he entered
upon office, on the 4th day of March last, the whole
amoant of outstanding and unexpended appropria-
tion , including those of the piesent and or all frr
meryeai*, was -           -           -   #33,429,616 50
Mr. W. found, from ¿he official re
port of the Secretary of the Se-
nate, (and which he it required
by law to make,) of the appropri-
ations of the last session df Con-
gress, of every character and lor
everv object, those for the Post
Office Department excepted, ihp
amount n as -           -           -     18,381,197 41
This would show that the amount
of appn priations outstanding and
unexpended on the 4th of March
last, over and above the whole
amount of appropriations for the
service of this year was          -   $15 048,419 09
Alt these sums are exemsiv ol ilu appn ptu-
tions for the service of the Post Ol! ce Department,
as those appropriations are only payable out ot the
revenues of the Department, and not out rf any
other means in the Treasury.
Here it should be observed that more lhan two
months of this year had passed away, and still Unit
this very large balance of the appropriations ot foi-
meryears,anamountapproachingv«ry closely tothe
whole amount appropriated foi this year, was un-
expended. It lelt, therefore, to the new Admi-
nistration, a very large measure ol expenditure, ¡I
the outstanding appropriations, without lele'ence
to the means provided, were to guide its action.
Under this state of facts, the proclamation was is
Mied, on the*17th of March, thirteen days after tin-
Administration came into poner, to convene C in-
gress on the 31st of May following, ,ih we .no now
told, because the situation of the public Treasury,
and the fiscal condition of the «ouritiy, rendued
that step indispensable, and this report from tl>e
head of the Treasury Department is made to show
us that necessity, and wheiefore and in whii man-
ner our aid is mvok d and can be ren iered
As to the first step towards the exhibition of the
necessity, the Secretary tells us that ol this whoit
amount of outstanding appropriations ol,
$33,429,616 50
There will be required to be ex-
pended for the servce of this year
the sum of       -           .           - 24,210,000 00
This will leave, on the 1st of Ja-
nuary, 1842, still appropriated
and   unexpended,   an   amount
equal to             -           -              $9,319 616 50
But it will -<how an expenditure,

ments from the Treasmy at ihat particular lime
The Secretary states these expenses
to have been   -           -           -   §4,627,166 64
And, calima: tnem theexpenditures
ol two months only, they show
a rate ot exptnse, per annum

And thi.i, tuo, met C. igioss v7a^ in "e ion din-
ing the w! ole o' the first iwo month1;, a..d tie entire
half-yearly payment for peí sions w*s taken frem
the Treasury dining tho-e months, tnus increas-
ing materially ihe expen Utures hayond a fair
monthly ayerags for the whole yea ; there
being nothing included m the proposed expenses of
the ten months for a session of Congress, except,
perhaps, for the commencement of the regular an-
nual session in December, and but oi e half-yearly
payment of pensions rématniDg to be made in trie
whole ten months.
He would next examine the outstanding appro,
priations under the several general heads of ap-
pnation, because it might be that, while the aggre-
gate of these appropriations was abundant, these
under a particular head, or for the service of a
particular Department, might be deficient; and
this he believed to be the more proper, as his re-
collection of the law of Congress, giving authority
to the President to order a transfer of moneys
from one specific obpei of appropriation to ano-
ther, was that the power of transfer was limited to
objects falling under the same general head and
under the charg  of the same Department
He would look, then, first to the head of "civil
list, foreign intercourse, and miscellaneous ex
pen«e«," being the app¡rpnations mere ltnmedi-
ate'y under the charge of the State Department.
The Secretary, in the report under consideration,
u'es the balance of unexpended appropriations
under this head, on the 4th of March last, to have
been          -           -           -           - §5,237,234 28
The   whole   appropriation    under
this hpad, for the service  of the
year 1841, was -           >-           -    3 801,475 51
Thus leaving at the command of
the Secretary au amount  of the
appropriations of former yt?rs,
over and above- the whole ¡sppro-
puation for the current >ear of 1 435,758 77
a sum more than equal to one entire third of the
nen appropiia'ion for thes  object^. And s ill he
well recollected, as would those members of the
Senate who gave attention to this appropriation
bill, whfn on its pa-ssa¿e through this body, in
March last, that if contained all the usual provi-
sions for annual salaries and the like, and outfits
for new diplomatic agents m all cases where vacan-
cies existed, or were expocted to exist during the
}ear Could it be, then, that this large excess
would be called for, or could be expended m the
last ten months of this jetr, within the rates of
allowance and compensation established by law]
He thought not
Next in order comes the "military" head, and
here the balance of unexpended appropriation is
astonishingly large Tne Secretary states it to
have been, on the 4th of March last, when he took
office, the enormous sum of           §15,991,895 15
While   the   whole   appropriation
made by Congress at its last «es-
'ion, for the service of the year
1841, under this bead, was but  -   8,657,384 90
Thus shewing a balance unexpend-
ed of the appropriations of for-
mer years of -           -           - #7,334,510 25
A sum almost as large as Ihe entire appropria-
tions for the service of the whole year, and le-
maimng unexpended, no' at the commencement ef
the year, but after the expenditures of the first two
months of it had actually been made. Was u pos-
sible to suppose that a necessity could exist for the
expéndame of ihis vast sum, under the ' military"
head alone, in addition to the whole appropriations
foi the year, a>jd that when bui ten mon'hs re-
mained? Ho v, then, could we fail to feel sur-
prest- win n *e fit d the Sec etarv, m addition to
these almost sixteei millions ot existing approp-i-
ations applicable o objects 'dil.Hs; under thf mill
tary classmentiori, asking i< r additional and new
appiopiiauons, to be mede ot this special session
of Congieos, under this same head, of $2,521,336
981 Yet s^ch was the iac', a tr.e repjrt undei
consideration woull show.
The "naval" Vid b"ais a more reasonable ccm-
pari.on The Secretary jivls the balances unex
prided on tl e 4 h i í Mar h las', under this head,
at              -                                   - §6,910,268 69
The aDpiopriations for the service
ot 1841 were      -           -           .    5,922,337 00
Thus merely exhib ting an existing
exress of tne appropriations ot
former years, unexpended when
the Secretary took office, and ap-
plicable to the navy, of
