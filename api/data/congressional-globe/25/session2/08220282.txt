APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mar. 1838.
25ih Cong- ..2nd Sess.
General appropriation Éül—Mr. Bynum.
H. of Reps.
a poor compliment to the intelligence and sagacity
of his constituents It had, in his judgment, ever
been one of the greatest misfortunes to the people
that their representatives, after getting to Well-
ington, learnt too much
They were too often taught different politics here,
from those they professed, when elected It was
exceedmglj unfortunate that we came here to
¡earn either our politics or morals. If Was by such
learning, and from such a source, that the people
had been too often placed under the necessity of
changing their representatives They were too apt
to learn here, very differentjlessonsfrom what they
had learned at home, and by this means, much of
the simplicity of our republican foritt of Govern-
ment had been departed from, and no party had
ever suffered more severely bj such «itiling and
teaming here, than had Ihe old truly Republican
Democratic party of this country
It w as here that their representatives had coli-
stanlly been won over by the splendor Of equipage
—the iningues of distinguished leaders—the great
conveniences of a great raonejed controlling institu-
tion, fiom the economical simplicity of a plain Demo-
cratical Government It was against this mode
of/earning and iiis/i action of members here, that he
had ever protested, as being repugnant to the best
interest of eveiy constituent people of this nation It
was, in his estimation, ¡reason to any party,that when
an) change «as effected in the course ot their le-
presentative, while here m the dischaige of his du-
tie% Itwasasouice of much of that party ran-
cV, that was so much to be depreca'ed in every
community It «as but natural, that when a re-
presentative deserted the party here, that had elect-
ed him at home, that he should move heaven and
earth afterw ards, in search of an excuse to justify
that deseition belter, far better, in his judgment,
that these changes should be effected at home, in
the piesence of the people, whose agents we pro-
tested to be here
Scents of this kind had become matters of daily
ot curence, disreputable alike to the representative
body, and the people whose want of sagacitj had
induced.them to select a changeling, to be ployed off
on, by evSry ntful intriguer, and to be used up by
any canting pohticnn, who might tempoianly
stand in need ot his services Sn, it hid been
such men after having been literally used by
men of superior parts, to justify their desertions
ot the people's inteiest whom they represented,
had converted mere specks of improprieties
into mountains of corruption, and joined in ihe
gieat c'loittsof «¿aims and ¡¡antes, to divert the
attention of ihe people from the infamy of their
own desertion and treason to the great interests
of their people There was no subject to which
the great body of the people should look
with moie intense anxie y, than to that of the de-
sertion of then lepresentative ot the principles
and interest, to carry out which he had received
their suffiages It\ws 1 rom such apt representa-
tives of the Demociaoj, who so eisily learnt things
here, that they had ever had the greatest danger to
apprehend, and by whom they had so often been be
trajed He ti usted most sincerely that the time
hid well nigh arrived, when the intelligent people
would brook such impositions and base betrayal of
their interests, principles, and sentiments, no longer
It was firm and faithful representatives that they
stood mostly in need of here Men that could
nevei be seduced by the blandishments of men oí
superior tact and design, or the overweening in-
fluence of moneyed facilities and conveniences It
is o( such influences that the representatives of the
people stand in the greatest dread and danger It
is against such that they have to guard with the
most sleepless vigilance for the preservation of the
great n0hts and liberties of freemen
Again, sir, the member has characterized this
as an extraordmaiy appropnation, with other ex-
traordinary measures ot this Administration It is
not at all wonderful that any measures of this
Administration should seem extraordinary to that
member, who would doubtless consider any thing
extraordinary that was not of bankish or whiggish
manufacture As extraordinary as it might seem
to the membei, he confessed that he saw nothing
of an extraordinary character about it    Instead
of being an extra, he thought it the most ordinary
and common-place meastite, so much so, that it
was about the last on which he had expected the
discharge of such a combination of artillery, and
from the preparation and show of which mighty
ejisíoitgW, he had been strikingly reminded of an
anecdote, by way of a metaphor, that had been
applied in that House, in answer to some retrtarks
that had been made o*er tlie way by his very
honorable foetid from New York, [Mr Csm-
briilenq,] on some former occasion, by a most
distinguished and talented member from the State
of Kentucky, who, he regretted) had not a seat on
that floor at that lime, foi, whatever failures and
imperfections he might have had, he made
fieetosay, though differing with him in general
politics, that there never had been a more valuable
member of that House, as a vigilant, and faithful,
and uncompromisiiig guard of the disbursement oí
the public levenues oí this country, nor a more
economical legislator He alluded to the honorable
Benjamin Hardin ol Kentucky That gentleman
had observed, in relation to some pieparation once
made by his Inend ovei the way, which he thought
could be with much more appropriateness applied
on the present occasion ¡ that he had put him in
mind oi a company of backwoods hunteis, who
had gone to the Rock) mountains, armed vvith the
best of rifles and muskets, w ith a most plentiful
supply ot both powder and ball, to encounter the
gnssly bear, and the moie rugged and ferocious
buffalo, and who, after arriving at the spot or
place oí contest, had shot away the whole of their
ammunition at minks and polecats before the
arrival of the noble animals for which they had
gone in search
After much pieparation and parade for an
attack upon the enormities of this Administration,
which had increased its expenditures by millions
and tens of millions of dollars, the member had
let loose the whole of his artillery against a little
"jel rf'iou," requiring an appropriation of some
three or four thousand dolíais, the painting or pa-
pering of some musty mantled room in the Presi-
dent's house of some two or thiee hundred dollar ,
and had dwelt with great emphasis and much
/cil upon the extravagant increase of expenditures
foi the printing of public documents Now there
might be some truth in all this, m which, if the
member was right even, so diminutive was the
game that he sti nek at, he doubled if the time he
had consumed in delivering himself upon these
subjects did not cost the Government more in re-
ality than the whole amount of the appropriations
here alluded to He had been exceedingly unfor-
tunate, however, in his allusions to the printing oí
public documents, though, as the member profess-
ed to be a "novice" in these matters, he was cer-
tainly in a measure excusable Foi any extrava-
gancies incurred by the legislative department, the
Executive could not, by any process of justice or
reason, be made iespoiisible The increase of the
pub'ic printing of voluminous documents had been
effected by both branches of Congress, and not by
the Execuu\ e, as the member would have his con-
stituents to believe, and he had now to learn, for
the first time, if the members of the party to which
that memVr belonged had not always been a<= for-
ward in asking information, and demanding it, of
the different departments, as those of the Adminis-
tration Had not the opposition party always been
ready, when any opposition was made to many, as
he supposed, of their unnecessary calls, (as he
thought, which was intended more to embarrass the
Administration than otherwise,) to rise up there
and to accuse the friends of the Administration of
a ilisposition to stifle, inquiry, and to prevent the
exposure of the truth? Let the member, though a
noviciate in thc^e matters, refer to the journals of
that Hou&o, and observe the yeas and najs upon
every subject of the kind
Sir, said Mr B I am proud whenever I can
hear gentlemen come out in favor of economy, re-
trenchment, and reform Upon tho«e subjects, he
would be glad to compare notes with the "member
irom New Jersey, or any other of his partv He
would then, and there, pledge himself to go with
that member, or any other, or any party, for any
reduction or reform that they might bring up m
good earnest, and ptess forward in good faith. He
had ever been an advocate of economy in bdtri
private and public life, and was ever ready, on all
occasions, to test his sincerity m either branch by
his practice.                *
But in undertaking these great measures of re-
form and reduction) lie did not believe that any
thing beneficial to the ¡¡libüc Welfare coiiíd U8
effected by coupling with them bitter lectures, and
malignant party rebukes Such would always
carry with them a greater presumptive evidence of
influences of party spirit than public good, and
would, therefore^ contribute greatly to defeat the
very object which they proposed to éftetít
Again an attempt of that kind should be direct-
ed at some great principle, or object of import-
ance, that might effect some radical change, both
in the revenues and disbursements of the public
moneys of the nation
Such were the reductions and reforms of which
he was m favoi, and to effect which he wottld
pledge himself to go as far as he who went
farthest. He doubted very much, whenever a
bmaf.de proposition for reduction and reform was
brought forward, whether he should have the aid
and support of the very economical and zealous
member from New Jersey
He [Mr. B.J had always believed that there had
ever been more collected out of the pockets of the
people, than there had been any real or absolute
necessity for, which had caused, more than any
other one thing that came withmhi* knowledge, an
inciease in the public expenditures. It had been
the great and fruitful source of those liberal and
prodigal appropriations that had been so much the
theme of denunciation with the Opposition for years
past, notwithstanding they had been almost the
sole and exclusive advocates and supporter* of the
veiy means by which much, if not all, of these ex-
travagances and prodigalities had been effected
Sir, it was nothing less than the "protective tariff,"
which was the prolific mother of all these extrava-
gances, and profuse and exorbitant appropriations,
that had been indulged in for years past, connected
with that notorious and prodigal system of internal
improvement, which, united with the protective
tariff, bore the political cognomen of the "American
Sysien ." It was that American System that had
given birth to every extravagant appropriation
By its effects more had been collected from the
pockets oí the people than there had been any ne-
cessity for, and it had been an inducement to all
parties to look out for new objects for which to
make appropriations, rather than to have the money
to he idle in the Treasury of the nation
He would here ask honorable members, who
had been the great champions and advocates of
this prolific mother of abominations, what party
did it originate with, and by what party had-  been
sustained?
Never had it been the doctrine of the Democra-
cy, or the conti olhng people, that seemed so much of
late to horrify a certain party as. this House, to col-
lect more from themselves than was absolutely ne-
cessary for the expenditures of the Government
Stop your exorbitant levies upon the people, and
exactions ftom the profits ot their honestlabor, and
there could then be but little danger of extravagant
appropriations It was by this "American sys-
tem" that the sluices of extravagance and prodi-
gality had been so widely opened, and overflooded
the whole country with the most profu5*, and, in
some instances, reckless appropriations It had
been the great fountain of almost every species of
governmental corruption, since its earliest organi-
zation
Now, I would ask, m all soberness, said he, will
the member from New Jersey, or any of his asso-
ciates in this indiscriminate party-war against this
Administration, join me in forthwith striking down
this tariff system, bv which so much has been unne-
cessarily collected from the peopls, to a mere reve-
nue standard? Is he, or his party, prepared for it?
Will he, or they, pledge themselves to vote for any
measure to effect it, hovever slightly? No, sir
No, sir you cannot get them to touch it, and they
yet live in hopes, if they ever should be restored
again to power, not to dimmish, bat to increase,
your tariff, and saddle on us again your American
