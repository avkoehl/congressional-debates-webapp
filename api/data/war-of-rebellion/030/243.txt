Colonel STAGER:

Colonel Gray, Fourth Indiana Cavalry, engaged the enemy 6 miles from Murfreesborough yesterday; captured 7 rebels and horses; repulsed the rebels at every point. Colonel Shanks, Twelfth Kentucky, attacked Morgan at Bear Wallow; repulsed and drove him from his camp; captured 9 rebels and horses; killed 1. Our loss, none. Probably Morgan is aiming for Muldraugh's Hill or Lebanon. Scouts watching him.

BRUCH.

TELEGRAPH OFFICE,

Nashville, December 26, 1862.

General R. B. MITCHELL,

Commanding Post:

I learn from the operator at Munfordville at follows:

That Morgan attacked bridge guard at Bacon Creek at 4 p.m. to-day; burned the railroad bridge, cut the wires, and tore up the track a considerable distance. It is supposed he captured a special train with two guns and two car-loads of ammunition being sent from Louisville to Munfordville. Commandant at Munfordville preparing to defend himself in his intrenchments.

Perhaps this should be sent to General Rosecrans by courier, as we are not in communication with him by telegraph.

Very respectfully,

C. DWYER,

Acting Superintendent Telegraph.
HEADQUARTERS,Munfordville, December 26, 1862.

Brigadier-General BOYLE,

Louisville, Ky.:

Major-General Granger says he is receiving telegrams, evidently from Morgan. Telegraph to him in cipher only. We must open the railroad soon, or Rosecrans will starve. Cannot you mass our cavalry as I suggested?
