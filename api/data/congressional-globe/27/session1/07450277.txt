currency, which has an intrinsic value, varying
less than that of any other commodity, and not at
all depending, as paper, on conñ lence, fear, conjec-
ture, or any oí the fluctuations ol public opinion "
Mr Barmg, m his evidence m March, 1819, be-
fore a committee of the British Parliament, had the
following question propounded to him
" Question, Has not France, altei years of great
scarcity va corn, and tw o j ears of foreign contribu
tion, been able to contribute a proportion of the
precious metals to the wants of Russia and Austria 1
" Anvoet Undoubtedly, the precious metals have
been supplied from France to Russia and Austria
and shipped to considerable amount to America,
notwithstanding the payments to foreign poweis,
and very large payments lor imported com , -whilst,
at the same time, wine having almost totally failed
for several years past, they vveie deprived of the
most essential of then exports "
And m refertnee to these ¡ aj ments, m the pre-
ceding answer Mr Barmg states tha' they "pro
duced no dotan^ement whatevet of the eirculaticn
of that countiy,   (France)
Mr Tooke observes, " It may not be unimport-
ant farther to remai k, that the state of the currency
in France, evei since the suppression of the assig
nats, appeals to be dccisne ot the great aaiantages
attending a metallic circulation in times of political
difficulty and dangci On no one great occasion
dtd her efforts appear to be paral} zed, or even íe-
stneted, by any derangement of the currencj , and
m the two instances oí her territory being occupied
bv an invading army, there do not appear to have
been any maieiral fluctuations in its valm " Mr
Webster remaiked, in the debate on the bank bill
in 1816, that ' the credit and circulation of bank
paper are the effects, rather than the causes, of a
profitable commerce and a well ordered system of
finance The bin't which will be erected bj the
bill, ii it should pass m its present form, is of a
most exttaor dinar \j, and, as I think, alaimmg na-
ture The nit rests i0 be affected by this measure—
the finances, the public credit and the circulating
medium ot the countr} ire too important tobe
hazarded in schemes like 'hese If we wish to re-
store the pjhhc credit and t > re-establish the finan-
ces, we have the beaten roaci befoie us All true
analogy, all experience and all just knowledge of
ourselves and our condition, point one «ay A
wise and systematic economy, and a settled and
substantial revenue, are the means to be relied on ,
not excessive issues oí bank-notes, a foiced circu-
lation, and all the misetoble contrivances lo which
po'ltical folly can resort, with the idle expectation
of giving to met c papa the qualrt} ofmonej These
arc the mventionsof shotl sighted pohcj, vexed and
goaded by the necessities of the moment, and think-
ing less of a jftmanenl remedy than of shifts anil
expedients to avoid the present distress With a
receipt of forty millions a year, (Mi W said,) if
the Government w is failhfvl to itself and to the
interests of the people, they could control the evil,
it was their duly to make the effort In tie end the

Gentlemen on the opposite side deprecate the in-
dications, in vinous quarters   ot a determination
to repeal if possible, this fiscal bank bill  should it
ever become a law     Dem icratic movements m

But have j on not m this House declared your in-
tention to  repeal the independent treasury bilí i
Not because it viola es the constitution , not because
it was a measuri   rashlv  or hastily adopted, and

however odious theory ofiepeal may sound,yetPres-
ídent Harrison, in 1819, virtually voted in favor of
repealing the chartered the United States Bank, and
President Tyler also virtually voted in favor of issu-
ing a " scire lacias" against the same bank [See
appendix] If you incorporate this fiscal bank, can it
be viewed in anj other light than as a party measure1
Do you wish the currency of the countryto vacillate
m unison with the mutations of parties 1 If you
locate the mother bank in this District, and unite
the Government and the bank as intimately as you
propose to do by this bill, cannot every argument
uiged foimerly against a Government bank, bv
those opposed lo the sub treasury, be turned with
accuti uhted force against this bill "> Why if the
possibility of the sub treasury degenerating into a
Government bank were just cause of apprehension,
hew, I would ask, ean those who strenuously oppo
sed that measuie now declaie themselves m favor
of the present bill i The location of ihe bank, and
its adv oeacy upon strict partv groun ds, hav e alarmed
and aroused the people Think \ on ihal the conn

touchstone of wisdom will not be brought to beai
upon the propriety of this measure, and that an
enlightened public will not be able to sépante the
time seivirg acts of the partisan from the eleva ed
and beneficent policy of the statesman i Why.too,
this haste' When was it before that a dominant
party m this House so effectually debai red the
members from the privilege of a free and full de

If jour puipose is to have a bank to manage the
fiscal concerns of Government, then the capital
of the pi ope sed institution is too Inure Mr A
Galium, m his recent work on ciiiicncv remarks
that ' a moll capital wiuld siifhcf fir K opera
tions in its di trader of fiscal ag nt ol tlu Govei n
ment It is believed that a capital nf fi ft eit million*
of dolíais, paid altogether in specie or in bank notes
equivalent to specie, would be amply sufficient'
On the contrary, it your design is lo establish a
commerual bank, then coinmcntal cities and com-
mercial men should both possess mel control ihe
bank Under rhe piuvrsions of this bill, youi bank
will be impotent, except for misd lef, for the com
bined political, fi«cal, and commercial considera
tions controlling 11s destmv musl result in mal ng
it injurious 10 trade, and dangerous to the liberties

But there aie other considerations which should
induce gentleme   not onlv, to doubt the propriety
of action on this deeplv important question at this
time, but to abstain from in mlging in bitter invee

all times encountered with a majority of the people,
should admonish them to act m accordance with a
maxim of the illustrious George Clinton. lie wise-
ly remarked that" Government is not to be strength-
ened by an assumption of doubtful powers, bat by a
wise and energetic execution of those whichjpre
incontestable; the former never fails to produce
suspicion and distrust, whilst the latter inspires
respect and confidence "
The friends of the bill seem to content them-
selves thus far by endeavoring to show that Con-
gress has the power to incorporate a bank. But
even if gentlemen had succeeded in establishing
that point, yet they have not demonstrated that the
bank now so zealously urged upon the country is,
cither "neccssaiy or proper" This latter consid-
eration should have been fullv and dearly demon-
strated To incorporate a bank simply because
gentlemen might suppose that the constitution con-
ferred the power, would be almost as unwise m
legislation as to establish one in direct contraven-
tion of the constitution, because it might be deemed
expedrent Expediency cannot make a measure
constitutional, that is inhibited, nor can sound poli-
cy under all circumstances, warrant our exercising
all' the powers with which Congress is clearly ln-
^Mv'honorable colleague (Mr. Stuart) alluded
to the course of the distinguished orator of Roanoke
on the bank bill in 1811 It is tiue, as he stated,
that Mr Randolph then voted against the indefinite
postponement of the bill, but I think it is equally
true that he was not in favor of the bank Ihe
vote against the indefinite postponement is far from
being a pi oof thai Mi Randolph would finally have
voted for the ml 1 B ut he may have given this vote
with a view of getting a direct vote, with the ex-
pectation of defeating the bill in the most decisive
manner It must be remembered, that Mr Ran-
dolph hadb-ensomewhatalienatedfromMr Jeffer-
son during Ins administration, and perhaps was
not a decided supporter of the then administration,
for he was soon found arrayed against the war
with England But in 1816 we have full and con-
clusive proof of Mr Randolph's opposition to the
United Stales Bank, both on the score of expediency
and constitutionality In the debate on the United
Slaies Bank bill m the House of Representatives
in 1810 Mi Randolph remarked that his objec-
tion to the agency of the Government m a bank
w as therefore, of no lecent date, but one long form-
ed—the obiection was vital, that it would be an
engine ot ínesistible power, in the hands of any
administration, that it would be in politics and
finance, what the celebiated proposition of Archi-
medes was in phjsics—a place, the fulcrum from
which, at the will of the Executive, the whole m
tion could be hurled to destruction, 01 managed in
anv way at his will and discretion But on the 5th
of April 1816 Mr Randolph " moved, for the pur-
pose of destroying the bill, that the whole subject
be indefinitely postponed He enforced his consti-
tutional oNcctions to the bill, m which he was borne
out by the decision of Congress in refusing to renew
the charier of the old bank , which decision was
grounded on tht w ant of constitutional power He
adverted, also, in support of hi, opinion, to the m-
st, unions from the Legislatures of Virginia and
Kentuchv t<> their Senators to vote against the old
bank " But my colleague intimated thatthe United
States Bank was not a federal measure In Mar

United States Bank bill, remarks, that it contn
