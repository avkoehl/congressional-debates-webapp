In connection with this report I desire to say that they have all been confined in the Saint Louis Military Prison the prison at Alton being exclusively devoted to prisoners of war. All the arrests were made at Saint Louis except where otherwise designated. No arrests were made previous to the declaration of martial law August 4, 1861. The recapitulation exhibits a list of those persons now in confinement exclusive of prisoners of war.

I beg leave to apologize for the delay in transmitting this record, but the confusion in which the records of the office were kept during the first two months after martial law was declared has rendered it as to cases occurring within that period unavoidable.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. E. LEIGHTON,

Provost-Marshal, District of Saint Louis.

[Inclosure.]
