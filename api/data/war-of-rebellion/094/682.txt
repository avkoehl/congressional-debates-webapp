The commandant of the post, Colonel Reid, consulted Major Wintter, the engineer officer, as to what garrison should be kept here. They the engineer officer, as to what garrison should be kept here. They both determined on the necessity of having 1,000 men as a garrison. I can therefore only send the excess of that number. I will send forward the men as rapidly as possible. All of Colonel Patterson's brigade has left here, except one regiment doing picket duty. All of Colonel Mabry's command of cavalry has also left. The Mobile and Ohio Railroad was recently threatened near Shubuta, below Meridian. A call for 500 infantry, from General Gardner, to go there and protect the bridge was responded to as requested, this place not being threatened and not then having orders to send any immediately to the army. The danger to the road seems now to have passed, and probably in a day or two the force will return. At all events this force goes to make up the 1.000 to be retained here, and also a detachment of 100 at Chickasaw Battery, on the Tennessee River.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. A. REID,

Captain and Assistant Inspector-General.
