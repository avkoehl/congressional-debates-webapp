FORT MONROE, May 15, 1864.

(Received 11 a. m.)

Brigadier General M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster-General:

The arrival of Sheridan's command at Haxall's increases the number of animals to be foraged about 14,000. In anticipation of some emergency of this kind, I have been forwarding all the forage I could spare to Bermuda Hundred, and have enough to last five or six days. I do not know how long we shall have to forage these horses. Colonel thomas informed me that forage was abundant. I therefore request that our supply be largely increased.

H. BIGGS,

Quartermaster.

BERMUDA, May 15, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

General Sheridan said that he would send a force toward Richmond this morning, and if there was anything at Chaffin's farm he would chase them out. They seem confident that they can go any-where and do most anything.

C. E. FULLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

MAY 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel FULLER:

You will take the disabled horses of the command of General Sheridan and pasture them in the best grounds near Bermuda Landing.

HEADQUARTERS,May 15, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Commanding:

GENERAL: I would like to get a little nearer to you. Let me run a line to the front and if we should have to fall back it will be but the loss of a few miles of wire. I wish to make the telegraph efficient regardless of trouble, expense, or danger.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHD. O'BRIEN,

Chief Operator.
