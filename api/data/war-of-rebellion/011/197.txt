CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD,

May 17, 1862-1 p. m.

Major-General BUELL:

You were ordered to move at 8 o'clock this morning. The movements of the right wing were based upon that. I do not understand the reason for the delay.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,May 17, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The reason for the delay was, that after making the examination which was necessary there was not time to get the troops well on the ground. I did not know that any of the right was to move to-day, nor did I understand that it was deemed necessary nor even important that the move should be made to-day, as you left it to General Pope and myself to decide on the time. I supposed that you would approve of a modification which we thought necessary.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

CAMP ON CORINTH ROAD,

May 17, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

You are entirely mistaken in supposing that the time of moving was left to be decided by you and General Pope. The time was definitely fixed on to be 8 a. m. when you left, and my orders to the right wing were based on that fact. The proportion of the ground to be occupied by each between Driver's and Farmington was the only matter left to be settled between Driver's and Farmington was the only matter left to be settled between you and General Pope. I regret very much that you have made any change in the programme arranged last evening without giving me previous notice and your reasons, as it derages my plans.

Major-General.

General HALLECK:

General Pope informs me this moment that he has moved his command. I shall therefore move mine at once.

Major-General HALLECK:

My whole command is on the road to Farmington. I trust I need not say that I am always ready to move, and only delayed this morning
