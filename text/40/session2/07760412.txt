THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
January 9,
want paper and reducing when you do not.
That is apparently their present position.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am in hopes ray friend
from Maine, when that proposition is fairly dis-
cussed and considered, will agree with me that
it is a very wise provision. I trust he will not
make up his mind until after we have discussed
it. But at present it is the opinion of the
committee, and I believe it is the opinion of
our constituents in all sections of the country
without regard to party, that all discretionary
power over the currency should cease, and let
the country rest under the extraordinary con-
traction that has gone on the last two years
until revived Industry can lift the credit of the
Government and carry on the business of the
country upon the basis of the present circula-
tion, looking, no doubt, to a time when we may
further contract .and resume specie payments.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I understand
the chairman of the Committee on Finance to
assert that the Bank of England is by law
allowed to increase or diminish the amount of
its circulation. I desire to ask the chairman
whether that is so or not I do not so under-
stand it.
Mr. SHERMAN. Up to a certain limit it
may increase or diminish, and then it may
raise or lower the rate of interest.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. That is a
very' different question. I know it has the
power to increase the rate of interest, but its
circulation is absolutely based upon fixed pos-
itive law, and that is to the amount of securi-
ties held by the Government and the amount
of specie held in reserve.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Pound for pound.
Mr. SHERMAN. But it has a right to cir-
culate up to a certain amount, and all circula-
tion beyond that must be based upon gold
deposits. However, it is not necessary to pur-
sue that argument.
Mr. HENDERSON. I should like to ask
the Senator from Vermont—perhaps he is
more familiarwith the question than myself—
if the privilege of issuing paper upon the
deposit of gold in the Bank of England is not
often suspended in time of commercial distress,
and paper issued without the deposit of gold ?
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. It was in the
crisis of 1857, and it has been since, and was
once before. The Government of England have
authorized the directors of the Bank of Eng-
land to disregard the law and have come into
Parliament afterward to get an act to ratify the
proceeding or to legalize it.
Mr. HENDERSON. And it has been twice
ratified by Parliament ?
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I think it
li&s been.
Mr. HENDERSON. There is no doubt
about it, I suppose.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. But that was
in times of great distress—a great crisis.
Mr. HENDERSON. Mr. President, I shall
not detain the Senate on this subject. I de-
sire to see the bill passed ; but, like the Sena-
tor from Ohio, I do not feel that it is abso-
lutely essential that it should pass, provided
the Secretary of the Treasury should remain
of his present opinion and not undertake to
further contract the currency. It matters not
to me what gentlemen may say about a return
to specie payments. I am very well satisfied
that if a return to specie payments is attempted
by stress of law and by contraction under the
present state of affairs, and at the rate of
$4,000,000 a month, or even at the rate of
$2,000,000 a month, the country will be en-
tirely bankrupted in less than six months from
to-day—not the country, perhaps, but a' great
many business men will be bankrupted, and
the law which we passed at the last session
will be exceedingly beneficial in granting bank-
rupt certificates. I do not stand here for the
purpose of condemning the Secretary of the
Treasury, because in many of his views and
opinions I agree, and especially in that one
which he so persistently urges, namely, a re-
turn to specie payments. I diffewwith him in
regard to the time of returning to specie pay-
ments. Sir, the country is in no condition
now to return to specie payments, and an
effort on our part to do so, 1 say again, would
simply end in bankruptcy. On the 12th of
April, 1866, Congress passed a law, which has
been alluded to by other Senators, in which it
was provided:
" That of United States notes not more than
$10,000,000 may be retired and canceled within six
months from the passage of this act, and thereafter
not more than $4,000,000 in any one month."
That act was passed on the 12th of April,
1866. Now, sir, I hold in my hand a state-
ment showing the monthly movement of the
public debt from July 1, 1865, to December 1,
1867, which Senators can obtain from the doc-
ument-room. It is Senate miscellaneous docu-
ment No. 13. By referring to this document
they will find that the greenback circulation on
the 1st of May, 1860, was $414,892,156, and
on the 1st of June, 1866, it had been reduced
to $401,856,156. There was a reduction of the
greenback circulation from May 1,1866, to June
1, 1866, of $13,000,000, whereas the law re-
quired that there should be a reduction within
six months of only $10,000,000.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The Senator will allow
me to say that the law only prohibits the retir-
ing and canceling of more than that amount
in six months. The Secretary of the Treasury
might make use of the notes in the regular way
at the Treasury, I take it.
Mr. SHERMAN. There is another expla-
nation. Under the law of two years before, I
will state to the Senator from Missouri, the
amount of these notes was fixed at $400,000,-
000, which reserve had been encroached upon,
and they retired that amount, of course, before
the law of April 12, 1866, took effect.
Mr. HENDERSON. That may be so; but
I call the attention of Senators to the fact that
from November 1,1866, after the expiration of
the six months, when the greenback circula-
tion was $307,927,428, there was a reduction
of more than twelve million dollars to Decem-
ber 1, 1866. How was that done? The amount
reported on the 1st of December, 1866, is
$385,220,167. Here is an absolute reduction
of the greenback circulation within one month
after the expiration of the six months, and
when the currency had fallen within the
$400,000,000, of $12,700,000—three times as
much as Congress had authorized. There is
no explanation, certainly, for that state of
affairs, because the contraction was to be lim-
ited to $4,000,000 per month.
Now, sir, I will refer to another fact. It
was ascertained by March 2, 1867, that this
contraction was ruinous to the country. The
contraction was not only in greenbacks. It
will be remembered that the compound-inter-
est notes were permitted to be held by the
national banks in their reserve; but, of course,
upon the maturity of these six per cent, notes
they were being rapidly retired, and in the pro-
cess of their cancellation or funding they were
taken from the vaults of the national banks,
and as they were taken away the banks them-
selves must necessarily contract. On the 2d
of March, 1867, an act of this character was
passed:
"That for the purpose of redeeming and retiring
any compound-interest notes outstanding the Sec-
retary the Treasury is hereby authorized and
directed"—
He was not simply authorized but directed—
I suppose, of course, if.it could be done, and
I understand that it could be done—but the
Secretary refused to do it, and hence the direc-
tion of Congress—
"To issue temporary loan certificates in the manner
prescribed by section four of the act entitled 'An
act to authorize tho issue of United States notes and
for the redemption or funding thereof, and for fund-
ing tho floating debt of the United States,' approved
February 25, 1862, bearing interest at a rate not
exceeding three per cent, per annum, principal and
interest payable in lawful money on demand; and
said certificates of temporary loan may constitute
and be held by any national bank holding or own-
ing the same, as a part of the reserve provided for in
sections thirty-one and thirty-two of the act entitled
'An act to provide a national currency secured by a
pledge of United States bonds, and to provide for
tho circulation and redemption thereof,' approved
June 3,1864."
I wish not to misrepresent the Secretary on
this point. I may be mistaken. Perhaps the
Senator from Ohio can correct me. I under-
stand he had authority to fund $50,000,000 of
the compound-interest notes in these three per
cent, certificates.
Mr. SHERMAN. He has funded $23,-
000,000.
Mr. HENDERSON. No, sir; only about
thirteen million dollars, as I understand.
Mr. SHERMAN. Twenty-three million
dollars, according to the statement of the 1st
of January.
Mr. HENDERSON. Then the additional
amount must have been within a few days past.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Will the Senator allow,
me to call his attention to the fact just alluded
to with respect to the apparent excessive diminu-
tion of United States notes in October, 1866,
which led him to infer that the Secretary had
exceeded his authority in retiring more than
four millions in that month ? The Senator will
notice that the statement that he holds in his
hand is a statement of the outstanding public
debt on those days. Now, the way those state-
ments are made up in connection with the state-
ments that are furnished to us, as he will see by
the paper he has on his desk, is this: in stating
the public debt, the amount of currency on hand
in the Treasury treated as cash, which they may
issue to pay debts the next day, and do, as it is
wanted, does not enter into the statement of
the public debt, and therefore if in October or
November, 1866, it appeared from that state-
ment that the public debt in United States
notes had been diminished $10,000,000, the
Senator will find, when he refers to the state-
ment of cash balances on hand, it is accounted
for by the fact that it is in the Treasury as
cash to be issued. He will see by this state-
ment which I hold in my hand of the public
debt on the 1st of January, 1868, that the
amount of currency, that is to say, United
States notes and other lawful money, in the
Treasury is more than $25,000,000, and that
he will find to be the explanation of the appa-
rent excess of diminution.
Mr. HENDERSON. I must confess that I
am at a loss to understand the explanation.
It may be my own fault, however. I under-
stand that this is a statement of the public debt
of the United States. Then what had become
of the remaining greenbacks? I understand
that there was outstanding on the 1st of Novem-
ber, 1866, $397',927,428, and only $385,220,167
on the 1st of December, 1866. What had be-
come of the remainder? And there is a coin-
stant decline from that day to this.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Very well. The remain-
der in that particular month, taking one montk
at a time, if the Senator exercised the author-
ity of retiring $4,000,000 is accounted for in
this way: the Senator will find, when he looks
at the cash balances in the Treasury on that
day that the $8,000,000 was in the Treas-
urer's office as cash subject to draft, and he
will find it so in this very statement. [" Oh,
no."] If Senators will look at the papers,
instead of saying "Oh no" they will find that
the statement of the debt on the 1st of Janu-
ary is represented in this way: " debt bearing
coin interest, $1,890,102,091 80; debt bearing
currency interest, $328,491,230; matured debt
not presented for payment, $15,871,640 83 ;
debt bearing no interest, United States notes—
"that is outstanding"—$350,159,127; frac-
tional currency, $31,597,583 85; gold cer-
tificates of deposit, $20,104,580," making
$407,801,290 85; " total debt, $2,642,326,253
48." Then comes "amount in Treasury, coin,
$108,430,253 67 : amount in Treasury, cur-
rency, $25,770,349 71;" which, deducted from
the outstanding debt, leaves the amount of
actual debt, less cash in the Treasury, so much.
Now I think the Senator will find when he looks
at the cash settlements that the supposed viola-
tion of law will be represented by cash in the
Treasury for the payment of the debts of the
Government.
Mr. HENDERSON. The Senator has re-
ferred to the statement of the public debt on
