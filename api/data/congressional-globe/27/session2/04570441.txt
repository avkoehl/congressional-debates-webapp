vantagea, which he enumerated, showing that the amount al
ready expended by the United States for extra allowances,
was one million seven hundred thousand dollars If to
these are to be added the expenses ofsurvey, the indemnity to
our own citizens displaced for the Indians, and other expenses
contemplated, amounting to at least foity thousard dollars the
aggregate would be two million two hundred thousand dollar*
If it was to stop there, he would n(t object, but he «.onsideied
this only a very small poition of the ejrpe se o be i ci ie!
There are thiee classes of expenditures ye«, untouched, unoer
the 14th article of the treaty lie read Iron that article Uip
provisions for grants oi lands to Indians becoming citizens of
the United States This, evidently was mtended as an encour
agement to civilization, but it nevei could be contemplated
by the treaty that the inducement should be transfeiab e to a
white man already a citizen, oi iiee to become one without any
such bounty
Ileie Mr Sevier read a report made by Mr Ward in 1831,
containing sixty one names oí Indian claimants Jt was received
in 1832 and lay at the departmei t for two yeais before the fiist
complaint was made Af'ertwo years had expired, complaints
were made that Mi Ward had omitted names which shoold have
been m the I i^t Gen Jackson in 1834, appointed Mr Martin to
go to that country and investigate the charges ot eomp'awt "Sow
he (Mr  .) contefided, not only from the fact that the report re
mained in thel)e[aLtment «o long without any complaint, but
from the high character of Mr Ward that his leport contained
the names of all just claimants Jn 183b, m the examination
which took place, Mr Waid, m his answers tu specific quet
tions, explained very clearly the manrer in which he had de
cided m rejecting claims Hue Mr toEviER read from the
examination the que&tions put to Mr Ward, and his an
swers He then referred to a íeport afterwards made by
Mr Black in March, 1836, referurg to the testimony of
Mr Ward, and certifying that he was entitled to the full
est confidence, fro n which it wis to be mferied that Mr
Ward's report was substantially correct ITp aleo handed in to
be read by the Secre ary of the Senate the letter of irlstruc
lions from Mr Dickeison, Secretary of War at the time Mr
Martin made a lepor , which, instead of dealing up the matter,
added tn the difficulty During the investigation ti e claims
multiplied so alarmingly, that at iasl it was necessary to ord r
a suspension ol the proceedings
He nett referred to various public documents for the pur
pose of showing the true natuie of tne claims and paincu
larly referred to pi oceedings of the General Assembly oí the
State of Mississippi on the sutiect which he requested
might be read by the toecretaiy ot the Senate
The proceedings, consisting of «ix pages, ncludtng the pre
ambleand ie*olutions adopte 1, togetn^r with the afíiüd^it of an
individual cognisant of the fac s on which the preamble an!
resolutions weie grounded, wete then lead There was a lengthy
report Irom Mr Black, confi ming every thing stated in the affi
davit In consequence of this the company formed to specu
late on these lands became broken up into sjb companies and
small tamifications—a 1 intent upon Iraud and plunder of the
public domain The fullest evidence was furnished to Con
gress of the frajdsthus contemplated E\ery session since the
lobbies and halls of Congress had been filled with the agents of
these speculators, clamoring foi Indian claims and now the ie
suit ff tins clamor is seen m the ingenuity and pertinacity of
the assignees which the Senate had witnessed He showed that
by the specific grants of the 15 h and 19th articles and the sup
plemeut, dlditional grants were tobe male amounting to up
wards of five millions of dolh s lie pn po«ed to sti ke out
from the bill all claims on tiansfers, and every tli ng not sp ci
ficallym conformity with i he treaty He had nothal time to
arrange these documen s, but he concluded he had thiown out
sufficient hints to show that it wasa bill not to he hastily adopted
The CHAIR explained that it was not morder to sti ike out
any portion of the bill pending the question to recommit the
bill with instructions
Some d scussion arose as to the mode of reaching the object
The instructions offered by Mr   Sevier were then reíd
Mr MOREHEAD suggested that the Senator from Arkansas
might offer his instiuctions as an amendment to the im nd

Mr HENDERSON observed that he wasopposed to Con-
gress authorizing any board of commissioners to act m a judi
cial capacity In decisions upon the tit e derived by the assigaeo
from the lidian claimants lie recapitulated the objects He had
n view ni framing the ms ructions which he had submitted
T ie Indian who made i is claim in good faith, and did ail that
was required of him by the treaty to get his right, should not
be requn ed to stay on t he land to btarve Having dotie all h$
c< uld and been d-iven off ¡ y the white population, he ehould
not be deprived of his right
With regard to the pioposmon to adjust these claims by a
payment of money n s ead of land, he conceived it altogether
unpiecedented aid tberefoie inadmissible Land claims of
oui own citizens alt ough of fifty years' standing, havealways
been sa^sfied by remunei anon in land and he saw no reason
why a practice should be adep ed owards Indians that was de
niedtovhite men while he saw many reasons against the
pioposition He expíameT several difficulties which would in
eviidbly ai Se out ot such a mode of at pistment
Hf would say nothvrgm the bill about the white raan He
would marly make the award to the Indian, and in land The
laws of Mis is íppi would adjast the matter between the In
dian=! and their assignees

Mr HENDERSON was aware of that
