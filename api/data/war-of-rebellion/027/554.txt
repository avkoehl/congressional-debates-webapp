Fifth officer, Colonel Jesse Segoine, One hundred and eleventh New York Volunteers:

Question. Same.

Answer. I never was consulted in any way, shape, or form; never advised a surrender to any one. I was told by Colonel D'Utassy that a council had been held, and that the determination was to surrender. This was about 8 o'clock in the morning.

Sixth officer, Colonel George J. Stannard, Ninth Vermont:
