Among the commanders are General Parsons, of Missouri, and Colonel Parsons, of Texas. On Wednesday night about 800 mounted men crossed in boats to this side and went up the river. Some force was reported to have come over and gone up a day or two before. Rebel foraging parties for cattle came up nearly to De Witt.
