AFP&NDIX T0 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOSE.
[February 22,
25th Coñg....3d Sess.
Executive Power—Mr. Stdde.
Ho. of Reps.
the inaugural «as pronounced, set at naught the
" máttuefíon and aid " which he professed to
" hope for from the coordinate branches of the
Government," by dismissing the Senate from
then- special session, with a message infoiming
them that be had no more business to lay hefoie
them, and then immediately proceeding to remove
collectors, comptrollerá, andttois, rnaishals, dis-
trict attorneys, land registers and ieceiVers, and
ministeism foreign countries, and supply ing their
places by his own appointmet f, with "the advice
arid consent" of nobody but his ursciupulous and
irresponsible partisan advisers' Do you not íe
member that among these example's of "lefortn,"
was the removal of the collector of the port of
New York, for nocanse but that of political non-
conformity, and the appointment in his placo of
Sanvüol Swnrtwout, who has recently run away
with $1,250,0110 of the people's money' Do
■vou not remember how the work nf " reform"
was corned on durin  the whole of the íecess be-
tween the dismissal of the S< natein Mairh, 1823,
arid its reassembling in Dcccmbei following' and
with what unsparing severity it has been cm nod
on fiom that time to this' And is there a man
who hears me who will assert tint it has not been
cairn d on from fiist to last, with the most un-
srmpnlous devotion to meie party inteiesls' Is
iheie one who does not know that thousands of
>< mováis and thousands of appointments have
bu n made fot the viry inn pose professi dly dep-
urated in the iiiaugutal—that of " bunging the
pnirnnage nf the Onvcinmcnt mlo conflict with
tin fiiednm of elections '" Has not the piomise
10 make " diligente, talents, integrity, and zeal,"
the ti st of qonlifiiation for offuc, been (lagrantly
violitcd' llave Any qualifications bien able to
smiirl the i ompctmon of paitisan "diligence,"
p vi usnn " tali nts," and pni usan "7cal'"
It has, however, bien said, and lecentlv said
on tint flooi by a metnbfi fiom Ohio, [Mi Div
t am,] that then are a gieit many Whigs left in
office, and lie has nndeitaUen topiovi it, by pio-
fissm  to give the number of Wings and \ilmin-
isnation men now in office in the vnrious riopait-
nunts. in tina edy Sn, 1 do not di ny that time

the Executive been" brought into conflict with the
fieedom of election " Indeed, it has been the
grand engine by which this dynasty has sought
to sustain and perpetuate its power
And what an inconceivable amount of power
may be wielded by a single hand, when that hand
holds the millions of patronage at the Executtve
disposal, and is guided by a will untegulated and
uncontrolled by any principle save that of self
and paUy aggrandizement Establish the prin-
ciple that every office m the gift of thp Executive
is held for disposal to the highest bidder—to the
man who can pay the most in partisan services-—
and theie is carried, with electric rapidity, through-
out the land, an influence which pollutes and cor-
mpts every tlnnir that it reaches. The standard
of political molality becomes lowered; and every
man who has a single aspiration for office is at
once tempted to inquire, what will promote my
mtdcsi' rathei than, what is light in principle,
and best for the interest of the count! y'
lULrllAMENT OF PROPHECY.
And, Mi Chairman, no men m this nation have
ever bettei understood the weakness of human
nature in this lispect, and the power which pat-
ronage ean! xert upon it, than those who have ad-
uunisttrid the Government for the last ten yiais.
Ibir, it is rematkable that the present Pie-udent
and Vico í'iesident of the United States, and the
" expunging" ¡5* nntor from Missouri [Mr Bln-
ton] weie leading members of the Senate com-
mittee on executive pationage in ltUb, whose
ltpoit—to which I havebefoie adverted—diawn
up by Mi Br vi on, contains a most glowing de-
sniption ot the danger ol an abuse ot that pat-
ronage feuQci me to read a paragraph from that

tic'cd on i kctir is to both brinches of Congress,
becking thereby to secuie a subservient Senate
and House of Representatives, it has actually en-
tered these Halls with Us party espionage and its
party dull Not a question of great public inter-
est has been decided here in which its power ha 
not been felt Not a member of " the party "
Ins ever given signs of a determination to thiow
off the yoke, and stand up in the conscious dig-
nity of legrs! itive independence, who has not been
made to feel the tenors of us íetribuftons Not
a Congress has existed for the last ten years
which has not witnessed the bes'ovvment of re-
wards on some of its members for distinguished
subseivieicy to the Executive, and upon not a
few of them, after they have been "elected to stay
at home," on account of such subserviency
Mr Chairman, no description of the woi kings
of this subtle influence has ever come up to the
full reality    NotW)thstanding all that Ins been
said on the subject, die half has not been  told.
! Indeed, sir, how could it be'   Consider for a
moment the extent of the means which the vast
patronage of the Execuuve enables him to employ
I to this end, and then remember that you have a
Chief Magistrate with a mmd so constituted by
nature, and so trained by political education, that
the idea of power to remove, or power to appoint,
never enttr his mind without an instant sugges-
tion of the inquuy—how may this powi i be used
1 so as to advance mi/ inti n sts and build  up miy
party'    Sn,you might as will (\pect that the
Ethiopian would change his skin, or the ltopaid
