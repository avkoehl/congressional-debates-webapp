HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Taneytown, July 1, 1863-4. 45 p. m.

Commanding Officer Third Corps:

The major-general commanding has just learned that General Howard has ordered you from Emmitsburg up to Gettysburg. General Hancock has been ordered up to assume command of the three corps-First, Eleventh, and Third. The general does not wish the approaches through Emmitsburg left unguarded, as they cover our left, and rear. He desires you to hold on until you shall hear from General Hancock, leaving a division at Emmitsburg, as it is a point not to be abandoned excepting in an extremity. A copy of this will be transmitted to General Hancock. Please put yourself in communication with him. Very respectfully,DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

NEAR GETTYSBURG, July 1, 1863-5 p. m.

General MEADE:

A portion of our troops have fallen back from Gettysburg. Matters do not appear well. My Second Division has gone up to the town, and the First on the right of the town. I hope the work for the day is nearly over.

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 1, 1863-6 p. m.

Major- General HANCOCK and DOUBLEDAY:

If General Slocum is on the field, and I hope he is, of course he takes command. Say to him I thought it prudent to leave a division of the Third Corps at Emmitsburg, to hold in check any force attempting to come through there. It can be ordered up to-night, if necessary. Sedgwick is moving up here, and will be pushed forward in the night, if required. It seems to me we have so concentrated that a battle at Gettysburg is now forced on us, and that, if we get up all our people, an attack with our whole force to-morrow, we ought to defeat the force enemy has. Very respectfully, &amp;c.,GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS TWELFTH CORPS, In the Field, July 1, 1863-6 p. m.

General ALPHEUS S WILLIAMS:

GENERAL: The general commanding the corps wishes that you would pay particular attention to your right, and keep skirmishers
