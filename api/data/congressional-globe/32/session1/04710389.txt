ADDITIONAL COMMITTEE CLERK.
The Senate proceeded to consider the resolution
reported by Mr. Walker the 22d instant, to
authorize the Committee on Revolutionary Claims
to employ a clerk.
Mr. WALKER. I will simply state that 1 re-
ported that resolution m accordance with the unan-
imous instruction of the Committee on Revolu-
tionary Claims. To that committee a cleric is
absolutely necessary, in consequence of the in-
crease of the matter that comes before them. They
have much correspondence to attend to, and there
is necessarily some traveling, in which they re-
quire the assistance askedfor, if it is contemplated
that they shall get through their business.
Mr. HALE! I want to suggest whether it
would not be advisable, as a matter of economy,
for the Senate to adopt the suggestion of Dr. Frank-
lin as to the barrel of pork) and say the blessing
over the whole barrel at once. Would it not be
better to introduce a general i esolutionr
Mr. WALKER. I may make a statement by
the authority of the committee. There are mat-
ters now before the Committee on Revolutionary
Claims, involving about four millions and a quar-
ter of dollars. Every case before that committee i
would, perhaps, if submitted to a court of justice, ;
be an intricate and litigated lawsuit. We ha\e:
to examine these matters; they involve in many |
instances an examination into the m'ost minute 1
portions of the history of the Revolution. To get '
papers from the departments, and have them prop- <
erly certified, involves an amount of labor which '
I aminchned To think few committees in this body ,
are called upon to perform. If these claims are to
be reported upon in proper time, and in a proper
manner, it is necessary that the committee should
have a clerk. These are the considerations which
have influenced the committee.
The resolution was adopted.

i Mr. CLEMENS gave notice that he should ask
