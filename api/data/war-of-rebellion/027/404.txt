left and troops of Slocum's division on its right. The battery was thus posted for the night. Being the only one over the mountain, its presence and position were valuable. After passing the crest of the mountain, the enemy were driven down the side rapidly, leaving a brass 12-pounder howitzer, horsed, and harness in their flight. This was taken and brought forward by my command (turned in to the chief of artillery of this army about the 28th instant).

MAJOR: I have the honor to transmit the reports of the operations of Snow's and Cowan's batteries during the battle of the 17th instant. Stuart's battery was detached for the time, serving with Couch's division. My own battery was brought upon the line under a heavy fire at about 11.30 o'clock a. m. The position was favorable and important. I ordered fire opened by it at once upon the enemy's batteries. From this time it was mostly under the immediate command of First Lieutenant L. Martin, my duties calling me to other points on the field. The fire from the battery was continued, with intervals, throughout the day. The enemy's batteries during those intervals are supposed to have been replaced, owing to damage received. Several batteries played upon them from our line at once, and a subsequent examination of the ground showed that they had suffered severely. The position of my battery being very important, it was retained in it until the enemy were found to have retreated.

The officers and men performed their duties with entire composure. First Lieutenant Harn, of Frank's battery, en route to join it, served with mine for several days and during the battle, doing his duty with zeal and credit.

Second Lieutenant James A. Sayles, Fifth Vermont Volunteers, adjutant of my command, performed his duties under fire with gallantry and judgment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
