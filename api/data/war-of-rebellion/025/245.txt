organizing troops and strategically far better than Helena for operations on the river. We are all very healthy, whereas I hear there is much sickness at Helena. I would like to have you send a division of new regiments here; they could soon be made efficient. My own opinion is that after discovering the exact point at which the boats in the Yazoo lie, whilst a force moves from here and Helena against Oxford, the gunboats and transports should threaten Vicksburg, as though an attack was intended, while a comparatively small force can land at some point below Gaines' Landing and strike across to the Yazoo.

Of course the movements of all should be prescribed as to time and kept absolutely secret, so that the enemy could not guess at your purposes-the first Vicksburg, and the real attack on the railroad and Yazoo.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
