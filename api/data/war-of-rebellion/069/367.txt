SECRETARY OF WAR:

I learn from a reliable deserter from the enemy that the Holcombe Legion, consisting of 300 or 400 men, has gone to Charleston, and that Colquitt's brigade is to follow on behind them. They were sent in pursuance to a telegram received by General Beauregard on Saturday, saying that by the time he (Beauregard) received the dispatch Secessionville would be in the hands of the enemy. This the deserter heard from Colonel Gaillard, of the Twenty-seventh South Carolina.
