HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Bull's Mills, Tenn., December 31, 1864-6 a.m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

An intelligent and apparently truthful deserter from Roddey's command says Roddey was driven out of Decatur Tuesday morning, stampeded and scattered from Courtland the next day, and was defeated at a point on the railroad six miles west of Town Creek. The rebels supposed the force after them to be under the command of Granger, and to consist of cavalry and infantry, not less than 15,000. They are badly scared and think they are gone up. Day before yesterday heavy cannonading was heard in the direction of Eastport between 2 p.m. and dark. The deserter reports that the rear guard of Hood's command left Tuscumbia day before yesterday at noon, the advance having left on Tuesday morning. The gun-boats were within a mile of the rebel bridge at Bainbridge and the people say could have reached it without trouble.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
