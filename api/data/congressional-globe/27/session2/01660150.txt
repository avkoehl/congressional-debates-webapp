Mr. RIVES said that he understood the Senators from South
Carolmaand New Hampshire as aflmitungthat there was an
incontestable necessity for an issue of Treasury notes, and if he
had not been misinformed, it appeared, from a communication
*l of the Secretary of the Treasury, that there was an urgent
demand for three or four millions of dollars to meet present h
abilities They all agreed that the accruing revenue would
not meet the demand and that it was impossible to negotiate
the remainder of the loan What, then, was left but a resort
to anissueof Treasury noteai Yet while the honoroftheGo
veramentwas at stake, and the jost claims of its creditors
must be discharged without delay, gentlemen came forward and
proposed a new question, aa much as to say, "We have you
in a situation in which we will profit by youi distress, and
stop the wheels, of the Government "
Mr CAJUIOUN observed that his fueras were willing to
give the five millions of Treasury notes
Mr RIVES understood perfectly well what the gentleman
said, and remarked that the proviso to the bill did, in effect,
repealthe loan bill to the extent of the amount provided m the
bilí before them, and that it was a party thing, to-obtam re
vengefor the proceedings of the extra session, and no Jung
else. It seemed to him that the whole object of gentlemen was
to stop the wheals of the Government, to do that which the
honorable Seua'or fiom Soiuh Carolina had often threatened
them with, by withholding supplies, and forcing them into a
compliance with his particular views The wnole efftct of the
proceedings of certain Senators was to say, 'you shad not
have one solitary cent unless you consent to take back the Loan
bill," andif gentlemen were prepared to go on m their reds
less opposition, arid were wilting to pla<-e themselves before
the country a3 wishing to destroy the credit of the Govern
tnent, he, foi one, was witling to take a more honorable posi
tion.
Mr WOODBURY observed that the Senator who had just
taken his seat imputed to him a misapprehension of the views
of the Secretary of the Treasury líe sai i that five millions
additional debt were not required to meet the present exigency,
as explained by the Secretary Such is his letter now in my
hand That Senator was himself in an error The Secretary
had, to be sure, stated that as much as five millions more would
be wanted to meet the engagements of the whole year, if Con-
gress caused an expenditure of twenty six or seven mi'hons
But m his late letter, which Mr W had read to the Senate, the
Secretary states that only three millions and thiee fourths be
yond the revenue ftom ou&toros would be needed for the pre
sent quarter, which was but little more than half oí the debt
now authorized, and could be effected without a íesort to any
additional debt whatever for this purpose
Mr W would add as to the further intimation from that Sena
tor [Mr Rives] of an unwillingness on this side of the house
to grant all the supplies now necessary, it was entirely un
founded Who delayed the passage of this bill, as it came to
ua, granting those supplies'? Who but he [Mr Rives] and his
friends* Who, by the motion now pending, postpjned the pay
ment of oar honest debts? Who, morder to annul what the
other House had done, stopped the wheels of Government*
Whocommencedand provoked this discussion* Who was re
sponsible for it?   Who flung this firebrand mto the Senatei
Mr KING had listened yesterday with great attention to the
expose of the chairman of the Finance Committee, but hid
not been able to discover m it any immediate necessity for
bringing up this agitating question of an additional loan At
the extra session, an ample provision was made for the present
year in the loan of twelve millions then authorized At the be
gmnmg of this session, it was alleged that the loan to a certain
extent could not be effected without extension of the term of
years, or m consequence of the embariassed condition of the
money market or someothei cause An extension of the time
would therefore be required Now, at a time that the Trea
sury is m such a predicament as to demand supplies without a
moment's delay, Congress finds itself called upon mahurned
manner, not to remedy the obstacles to the loan authouzed iast
se3sion,but to grant authority for an additional loan of five mil
lions The propei branch 01 Congress for originating bills of
supply, had maturely weighed this matter, and had sent the
present bill before the fcenau in the form moot approved by
that b?dy The othei b anch of Congress had deemed this
supply amply sufficient for the pressing necessities of the Go
vernment for some time to come
The bill came to the Senate m this shape and because the
friends with whom he (fir King) acted wished to pa=sitwiih
out alteration, they are told they offer a factious opposition1
Because they will not sanction a vital change of the whole
principle of the bill—a change necessarily provoking delay
and discussion—involving a principle they have always con
tended agamst—they are to be charged with the blame properly
belonging to the gen'leman and his friends who piopose that
change It is even charged that his (Mr King's) friends ave
actuated by a reckless disposition, a revengeful disposition to
undo what was so ably dorse at the extra session but the Sena
tor did not instancea solitary point to prove that hey had showr
a disposition to embarrass the operation of the Government
They saw that the Government was embarrassed in its circum
stances, and it was their duty to provide for it*, wants and
givs it means to pay its debt* and although they had some ob
jection to pas& the bill in its present shape they were piepared
to take it And who was he who now came forward and who
«aid that representatives of the people were actuated by a fac
tiousspnni   It was the Senator from Virginia, andhe catted
oi him tosay whether------
Mr RIVES did not sav that the representatives of the people
were actuated by a factious spirit, he had cast no such impu
tation upon the motive** of Érentíemen in the Senate or m the
other House,
Mr KING temarked that tie proviso was adopted by tho&e
in the House who wisht, 1 to keep the Government within pro
per limits He believe! that, with suitable economy the
amount priposed wis mply sufficient and also that if they
confined themselves wti i propei limits the Govemr ent
could be carne i on with ut increasing its mJebfedness sn a-, to
require a larger apt roj nation H? believed that the proveo
in the bill was suggest"    by a hi<di mmded "V r§imai in the
th**r House-----
Mr PRESTON rose end wquired whether H was m order to
allude to the proceedings of th-1 o'het House'
Mr KING sail thath1 was at liber y to do so
Mr PRESTON would now make the point    It was, tha* a
direct allusion to the proceedings of the House of Représenla
tívea was out of orderl
Mr SEVIER remarked, that he believed the point correct,
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
but why did not the Senator from South Carolina [Mr  Pres
ton] make his point sooner?
Mr KING abked,what said the Chair?
The CHAIR replied, that it was not m order to allude to the
proceedings of the other House
Mr KING remarked that it migh,, with the same propriety,
be said that he could not read the journal of the other House, and
say that Mr Gilmer introduced the proviso, and that it was
voted for by the particular friends of Mr Tyler and others But
he rose to protest against any imputation, from any quarter, that
he and his friends were piompted by any factious spirit, they
were actuated by a manly and frank disposition, and would evei
oppose any proposition to increase the debt of the country, and,
unless the proviso should be retained, they were of opinion that
the effects which they so earnestly deprecated would certainly
Jbe produced
Mr iUVfi.3 observed, that if gentlemen were so anxious to
provide means for the Government, why not let the bill pass as
a measureofsupply, without insisting upon the proviso being
i ©tamed If It was passed without the proviso, it would still
leave the question of repeal of the loan bill untouched, which
would come up hereafter m its naked fotm, when they could to
their hearts* cortent, discuss the means of the Government for
the year and the future policy of the country
Mr BUCHANAN observed that, for his own part, he was
d sirous of furnishing the present Administration with the ne
ce-^ary means to caí i y on the Government He had been drag
ged along from year to year, against his own judgment, to vote
for Treasury notes The necessities of the country had been
such as to demand a resort to this species of currency And
yet he would much rather grant a loan at seven percent than
to be goins on thus blindfolded The people would then know
how much they were m debt, and would not be be blind
to the consequences But such was his disposition to relieve
present wants that he was ready and willing to grant these five
millions of Treasury notes He believed it was neces aryto raise
present means by these notes for the relief of the public Trea
sury under its existing embarrassment, therefore he was wil
ling to go alor e, as he hid always hitherto done, although still
against his own conviction What is the claim made by the
Treasury "Department1? Is it not for mpans simply to relieve it
from us immediate exigencies'? Is it not for some more availa
ble means than an inoperative loan bill* And is the bill now
before the Senate a repeal of the law1* He denied that it was
At the extra session.Congress authorised a loaj of twelve mil
lions Five and a half millions of that loan had been negotiated
leaving a\x and a half millions undisposed of The difficulty
with the Government was to negotiate this balance of six and
a half millions One proposition to get over that difficulty, was
to extend the term of the loan Another to rendei it more
available by changing the form of if nto Treasury notes pava
ble in one year Now, if Congress admitsof changing five mil
lions of the loan into Tieasury notes, will notono million and a
half of the original loan be yet available to the Treasury, should
any favorable change in the market occur to render it negotia
ble? The present bill authorizes merely a substitution of Ti ea
sury notes for so much of an authorized funded debt But
what does tne proposition to strike out the proviso of this
bill amount to? Does it not amount to making a new loan of
five millions m addi'ion to the funded debt of twelve millions
already authomed? And was his side of the chamber to be
charged with a factious opposition? ptfr Clay "No not this
side of the chamber " Laughter ] Well, were his friends to be
charged with factious opposition—were they to be blamed on
thi<í or any other side of the chamber, because they express
their willingness and readiness to pass a bill, without alteration
and without discusión granting a supply of ffve millions of
dollars as part of the bin of twelve millions, not available m
its original shape? When more is wanted, let it be aiked for in
a sepílate measurt, and at a period of the session which will
give time for deliberaron and discussion The question is ne
cessanly one piovoking discussion, and consequently delay
I et a more appropriate time be chosen for del ating it Mean
tune, the necessity for an additional loan may be avoided
Grearetrenchmentscan be made, m conducting the Govern
ment accoidmg to the promises of economy so lavishly made
on the present administration coming into power For his own
part, he was willing, as he said before, to co on as he had h therto
done though in opposition to his own convictions, and to vote
for this issue of Trea&my notes as part of the loan of last Beg
b on ma more aval able form than that loan
Mr PRESTON said that he had alwaysbehe'ed itto beun
constitutional to rai^e money m the wav of Treasury notes
and tnerefoie had always voted against the issue and should
continue to do so under any and every emereency whatever
The Convention which framed the present Constitution reject
ed the proposition to emit bills, and aubstitutecUanother mode
of raisin0- he necessary supplies—by taxes and by loan** He
was not disposed to stop the wheels of Government hut would do
so whenever they run counter to the Constitution It wa?,
however competent for Congress to make the loan bill effi
cient ml, rather than subm t to an unconstitutional andmjudi
ci ius act, 1 e wiuld pay *he expenses of the Government out
of thefubtio pur<!e let them extend their loan for twenty
vears at an interest of sixteen or seventeen pei cent if neces

Mr CATHOUN "iilthe wbo^eissuewas this theSenator

one of their great acU of the extra session, and he (Mr Caí,
POtr\)and his friends, who opposed those great acts because
they foresaw the consequences aie to be called upon now to
yield up all the principles they have been battling for, to «av#
the gentlemen from committing an act of inconsistency* The
gentlemen had to be obliged to undo their own acts, but they
will, in spite of all heir struggles to avoid it, have to submit to
imperious necessity Their great acts of that famous extra
session will fall, one by one They will have to admit that the
whole of them were blundering mistakes He would say to the
gentlemen that they themselves are responsible for not only the
condition in which the Government is placed, requiring this
supply, bufefor the delay in granting it immediately This de
lay 13 the result of their attempt to alter this bill, for if they
would permit it to go to the vote without their amendment,
there would not be a single day's delay The gentlemen them
selves force upon the Opposition this delay They have the
majoiity in this and m the other House, and can pass the bill as
it stands; but they do that which provokes delay, and on them let
the responsibility rest

there appeared for it—

forced on them, hewi&hed to be heard at length, and, there

Mr MERRICK desired to go into executive session for a few
moments but there were cries of "adjourn "
Mr WOODBURY said the Senator from Missouri had
an amendment to offer to the bill, and he also designed to of-
