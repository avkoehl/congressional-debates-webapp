Brigadier-General HARDIN, Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 5. 25 this morning is received. The major-general commanding directs me to inform you that, in the opinion of General Halleck, Fort Stevens is the real point of attack, the enemy's movement in front of Reno being but a feint. Therefore the Sixth Corps is being sent to that point. In case, however, it should prove otherwise, you can call for assistance from your right.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
