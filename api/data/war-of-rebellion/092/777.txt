HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Savannah, GA., December 21, 1864.

Major General H. W. SLOCUM,

Commanding Left Wing:

GENERAL: An officer of General Howard has been to Fort Beaulieu and communicated with the Sonoma from which he learned the General-in-chief has gone to Hilton Head, though it is not sure. However, the fleet is fully aware of our position here, and I will make dispatch to the admiral, requesting him to at once commence on the obstructions in the channel. To have a complete understanding about pickets and road guards it seems to be best that you should take charge of that section from the Savannah on the west around to the plank road, and General Howard from there around to the Savannah on the east. This is his suggestion. He will also guard the plank to King's Bridge. Some of his troops are now properly stationed about it and will obviate moving troops especially. The King's Bridge will be necessary our base for several days, and should be well secured against cavalry from the west. General Howard will retain a division at the Ogeechee for that purpose. General Howard wishes you to reconnoiter and if practicable throw a bridge from Hutchinson's Island to the main land in South Carolina.

I am, General, very respectfully, &c.,

L. M. DAYTON.

Aide-de-Camp.
