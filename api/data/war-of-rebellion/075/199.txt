ATHENS, May 15, 1864.

Brigadier General J. E. SMITH:

Elk River is past fording at crossing on main road to Rogersville, and will not likely run down before to-morrow or next day. Have just seen Mr. Huston, who says there is no enemy at Rogersville and that Forrest is at Iuka, or was a few days ago; otherwise his information is the same that I sent you yesterday. The cavalry had to go to Prospect to cross Elk River. From Prospect Colonel Rowett said he would take the direct road to Florence. Have heard nothing from him yet. The enemy patrol the road from Florence this way as far as Elk River.

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General J. E. SMITH:

Scouts just returned from Elk River report artillery firing this morning in the direction of Florence. This firing was not heavy. They also report that enemy's scouts or picket were seen this morning on opposite side of Elk River, on Florence road.

Brigadier-General.

SPECIAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. MIL. DIV. OF THE MISS., Numbers 6. In the Field of Resaca, Ga., May 15, 1864.

The movement of the troops for to-day will be as follows:

I. Major-General McPherson, re-enforced by the cavalry division of General Kilpatrick, will continue to threaten the line of the enemy's communications by a pontoon near Lay's Ferry and a good lodgment on the other bank. He will hold the strong defensive position gained yesterday from the Bald Hill to the Oostenaula near the mouth of Camp Creek, prepared at all times to assume the offensive.

II. Major-General Thomas will hold one corps (General Palmer's) on the defensive, holding the line of hills on the west side of Camp Creek, connecting strong with General McPherson on a line with the Bald Hill, with a reserve in the large field behind it (i. e., the cleared valley of the west branch of Camp Creek). The other two corps, Hooker's and Howard's, will make a steady and strong attack on the enemy along down the ridge between Camp Creek and the Connesauga toward Resaca, but will not assault fortified positions unless sure of success.

III. Major-General Schofield will support the line of General Howard and General Hooker, and be prepared to resume his place on the left as soon as the ground will permit. During the advance he will hold his troops to the left rear of General Howard and General Hooker's line.;

IV. All the troops should be in position for action at daylight and the general movement begin at 8 a. m.

By order of Major General W. T. Sherman:

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
