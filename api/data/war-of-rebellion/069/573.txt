HEADQUARTERS, June 4, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK:

Do you design opening fire at midnight under the instructions of 9.30 p. m.? It does not appear to me judicious, and I shall not open unless it done by every corps commander. I believe it will severely interfere with our approaches, and it will certainly interfere with the sleep of the men.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General, Commanding Sixth Army Corps.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 4, 1864-10.50 p. m.

General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

I have directed that no opening will be made unless provoked by the enemy or by the enemy's responding to the fire by other corps on my right; in either of which cases I will open after the working parties are withdrawn and will probably continue the fire until daylight. I do not desire to open. I think it is probable the enemy will do so in opposition to some of our working parties.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding Second Corps.

SECOND ARMY CORPS, June 4, 1864-10.45 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: I do not think it wise for me to open with my artillery, as my working parties are so close to the enemy, unless they should open in reply to the artillery of other corps or open without provocation, in which case I will reply. If the enemy fire at all, I shall open and continue the firing until daylight.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 4, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

I shall open an artillery fire at 1.30.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, June 4, 1864.

Colonel J. C. TIDBALL, Commanding Artillery:

COLONEL: The major-general commanding directs that you open with your batteries on the enemy's line at 1.30, giving orders to battery commanders to fire as deliberately as possible, and with due regard to the expenditure of ammunition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
