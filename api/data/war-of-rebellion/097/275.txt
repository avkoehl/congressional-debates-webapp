Brigadier-General BENHAM,

Commanding Defenses, City Point;

Your dispatch of 11 a. m. received. I have just learned that the cavalry picket-line from James River was withdrawn this a. m. There is, therefore, no cavalry at prince George Court-House. General Collis having arrived here I told him to send the cavalry regiment to Prince George Court-House and pickets and patrol the roads between the Blackwater and the left of your line. He now returns to City Point, and will turn this regiment temporarily over to your command. He has directed the commanding officer to send reports direct to me as well as to your headquarters. This I think will completely protect our rear from inroads of scouts and guerrillas. Any additional precautions you think necessary you are fully empowered to carry out.
