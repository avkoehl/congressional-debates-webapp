My thanks are due in an eminent degree to the members of my staff for their untiring zeal, particularly to Captain P. W. Black, acting commissary of subsistence, who distinguished himself on Sunday, April 2, in carrying out my orders and assisting me in rallying the men.

In conclusion,it gives me sincere pleasure to add that the officers and men of my command behaved, under the most trying circumstances, with courage and fidelity, carrying out all orders to my complete satisfaction, they having now the proud satisfaction of seeing a stubborn enemy, whom they have combated against for nearly four years, humbled, thereby adding their feeble mite to promote the life, prosperity, an independence of our nation.

I have the honor to remain, colonel, your obedient servant,

ROBERT NUGENT,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

Lieutenant Colonel RICHARD A. BROWN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division.
