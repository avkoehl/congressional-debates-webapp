Major-General HALLECK,

Telegraph to General Grant that I am here, and we have advanced our lines three miles to-day. McPherson is one day behind. I will attack Tunnel Hill on Saturday, and, in the mean time, will occupy Johnston's whole attention.

WHITESIDE'S, May 5, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

Harrow was at Lookout Station at 11 a. m. Will hardly cross the mountain to-night. Morgan Smith camps at Wauhatchie to-night, and Osterhaus is camped two miles from here. The trains are very large, and the road so hilly as to spread him out very much. I stated to him the importance of improving them, and the prospective use of their several commands. I will go to Shellmound to-night probably, as there is a telegraph office there.
