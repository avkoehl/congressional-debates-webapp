OKOLONA, May 4, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The dispatch concerning Forrest just received. Would it not be best to unite the Confederate cavalry of this district with mine, and move to meet and co-operate with Forrest? Please answer immediately, as forage is scarce, and your answer will determine my direction.

JAMES R. CHALMERS.

OKOLONA, May 4, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

From Rocky Fork I could not cross Mud Creek, and had to go below Pontotoc for forage. I moved toward Okolona, where the enemy was reported to be. Made forced marches, and was starting again at 2 o'clock this morning when General Ruggles informed me the enemy was gone. My horses and men need rest very much.

JAMES R. CHALMERS.

OKOLONA, May 4, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

I have been unable to overtake the enemy. I am now proceeding to Verona, to attack a body of enemy reported at 500 strong at Tupelo last
