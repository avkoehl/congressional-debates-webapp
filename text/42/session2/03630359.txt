AMENDMENT OF RULES.
Mr. COX. I am directed by the Committee
on the Rules to report the following resolution:
Resolved, That Rule 130 be amended by inserting
in the proviso thereto, after the word referred,"
the words "and all bills at any time introduced by
unanimous consent and referred."
Mr. HOLM AN. I ask that Rule 130, which
it is proposed to amend, be read.
The SPEAKER. The present rule is, that
bills introduced and referred under the Mon-
day morning call shall not be brought back
into the House upon a motion to reconsider.
This amendment provides that bills introduced
on other days by unanimous consent shall not
be liable to be brought back by a motion to
reconsider, which will obviate the necessity
of members watching daily in order to make
the motion to reconsider and lay on the table
references of bills, &c.
Mr. HOLMAN. That is a very excellent
amendment to the rules.
The resolution was adopted.
Mr. COX moved to reconsider the vote by
which the resolution was agreed to ; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Various committees were called, but no
reports were presented.
Mr. BANKS. As it appears that the com-
mittees are not represented here to-day, I
hope the call will not be finished, as it may
deprive us for a long time to come of an
opportunity to report upon measures which
may be referred to us.
The SPEAKER. It is now after twelve
o'clock.
Mr. BANKS. There being no response, it
is evident the parties are not in court.
The SPEAKER. The Chair knows no other
duty than that laid down in the rules, which is
to call the committees during the morning hour.
discoveries of guano deposits.
Mr. BANKS. I have a report to make from
the Committee on Foreign Affairs. I have
sent to the committee-room for it, and mean-
while will make a statement of the facts of the
case.
A bill was passed in 1856 giving to the dis-
coverers of guano islands the right to make
a claim of their discovery, and oil the claim
being verified and approved by the State De-
partment the islands so discovered were to
be taken under the jurisdiction of the United
States and the discoverers to be allowed cer-
tain privileges with regard to taking guano
from those islands at the pleasure of Congress.
Tho discoverer and his assign were the only
parties recognized by the bill. Subsequently,
in 1857, Mr. Parker discovered Johnson's
island and Avres's island and several" o:her
islands upon which were guano deposits. He
filed a claim of his discovery in the State De-
partment. _ After some rejections on account
of informalities, and after the filing of amended
claims, the claim was allowed by the State
Department as legitimate. No claim for the
discovery of these islands has been made by
other parties. The discoverer, Mr. Parker,
suddenly died in this city some years ago.
His discoveries have proved to be of some
consequence; Â«nd his widow and heirs asked
of the Congress of the United States that the
law of 1856 might be sj far amended as to
include the widow, heirs, administrators, and
executors, of the discoverer in the same rights
and privileges, at the pleasure of Congress,
which the discoverer and his assigns would
have had under the law of 1856.
The se.cond section of the act provided that
no guano taken from these islands should be
exported or sold to citizens of any other Gov-
ernment than that of the United States. An
amendment to this law suspended this prohibi-
tion for a term of five years. That term has
now expired : so that if we should approve the
proposition to amend the lawgiving the widow
and heirs of the discoverer the same rights that
the discoverer or his assigns would have had,
they would still have no benefit from this law,
unless we should extend from five to ten years
the suspension of the prohibition with regard
to the sale or exportation of guano to others
than citizens of the United States. Such a
provision is contaiued in the proposition I sub-
mit. As I have the bill now I will send it to
the Chair to be read.
The bill was read by the Clerk. The first
section enacts that the provisions of the act of
Congress approved August 18, 1856, entitled
"An act to authorize protection to be given
to citizens of the United States who may dis-
cover deposits of guano," be, and the same
are hereby, extended to the heirs, executors, or
administrators of such discoverer, where such
discoverer shall have died before perfecting
proof of discovery or fully complying with the
provisions of said act approved as aforesaid.
The second section provides that section three
of an act approved July 28, 1866, entitled
"An act to protect the revenue, and for other
purposes," amendatory of the act aforesaid,
approved August 18, 1856, be, and the same
is hereby, amended by striking out the word
"five," wherever the same occurs, and insert-
ing in iieu thereof the word "ten," so as to
allow the heirs, executors, or administrators
of deceased persons who may have discovered
deposits of guano time to remove the same.
Mr. BANKS. The Committee on Foreign
Affairs report back House bill No. 166, to amend
an act entitled "An act to authorize protection
to be given to citizens of the United States who
may discover deposits of guano," approved
August 18,1856, with the recommendation that
it do pass, with the following amendments.
The Clerk read as follows:
After tho word "the'" in line seven, insert the
word "widow;"so it will read: "be, and the same
are hereby, extended to the widow, heirs, exec-
utors, or administrators of such discovcrcr, where
such discoverer shall have died before perfecting
proof of discovery or fully complying with the pro-
visions of said act approved as aforesaid."
In lino ten, after tho word " aforesaid," add to the
first section tho words "after complying with the
requirements of the act ol Congress of August 18.
1865."
At the end of tho bill strike out the words " so as
to allow the heirs, executors, or administrators of
deceased persons who may have discovered deposits
of guano time to removo tho same."
Mr. DAWES. I hope the sections which
are proposed to be extended will be read.
Mr. BANKS. I will send them to the
Clerk's desk to be read.
