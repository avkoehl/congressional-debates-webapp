General CRAWFORD:

Push the enemy back to his breast-works, and form you line close to it, but don't assault until we get the others up.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MAY 10, 1864-12 m.

Generals CRAWFORD and CUTLER:

It is very desirable to ascertain where the enemy's main line of battle is. I want them well pressed to drive back his covering force if it can be done. I would not, however, advance a stronger line than a single rank would make, for I think that will do it. Hold all you get.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[General G. K. WARREN:]

GENERAL: My line has fought its way to within range of the enemy's entrenchments. We are so close that the troops cannot stand up without drawing a volley from the enemy. I will hold the crest of the ridge I now occupy as long as it can be done. Colonel Carroll is now on my left with a brigade. Our troops suffer in their present position severely.

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

Anderson's brigade, of Field's division, is in my front. Communicate with me.

Brigadier-General.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff;

The left of my picket-line has been moving forward since soon after daylight, and the reconnoitering force sent out yesterday has crossed the Alsop road 200 or 300 yards and reports a line of battle in its front-strength not stated. I have sent two regiments to its support, with orders for it to feel the line. My picket-line is all ad-
