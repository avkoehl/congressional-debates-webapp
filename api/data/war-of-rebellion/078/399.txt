HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, La., September 17, 1864.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff of the Army, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I send for your consideration copies of some correspondence between Admiral Farragut, General Sherman, and myself. * If the troubles in Arkansas are ended as soon as I hope they will be, I can then employ 20,000 or 25,000 men in season for Sherman's movements. If the more important operations in the direction of Montgomery and the Appalachicola River are attempted a much larger force (not less than 40,000 effectives) will be required, that is 15,000 or 20,000 in addition to the force I can gather here.
