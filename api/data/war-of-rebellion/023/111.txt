WARTRACE, July 9, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Dispatch received from Colonel Barnes, but I doubt the truth of the report. I have received two dispatches from him since, reporting a force of 20,000, which is not confirmed. Pelham is 35 miles from this point. Scouts of the Fourth Kentucky Cavalry were at Hillsborough yesterday. Found all quiet. Found no stores of any kind.

H. A. HAMBRIGHT,

Colonel.
