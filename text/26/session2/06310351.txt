Tnas yo-i ?ee, Mr Chmrman. that the effor's
< f ( ii ho i rao'e Secretary of Wa , and of other
ofkctrs of Government, lai'ed to b mg tho-e ne-
nt^esbirkto a "tale of slavery, an 3 the agents
of Wa'-on were compsdled to retam without the
nc' oe
But, n th° mem time, Mr   WaUcn's  mon^v
was ?;one, and  the  negrees  were gone also.    He
had bought ihe negroes, as he says, upon the  assj
tapce  of   ti'Ie   held out to him by  the  officers
oí Government.   These officers had everted ihdf
utmost skill to get the regrces for him, but all had
failed, and Mr. Watson Then appltf d to Congress
ror compen'anon for hw loss. Í he C< mmissioBer
of Indian Affairs and the honrrabie Secretary of
War, boih recommend the claim to the favorable
cms deration of Congress, and uigs us to mak"i
the appropna'ion. Of the propriety of doing so I
shall say nothing at thi  time. I hope to do my
duty on that subject when it comes before -us." My
obp-et now is to show ihe manner in which the offi-
cers of this Government have attempted, not only to
ma'.e us in our national c'rarac er slaveholders and
slave trader", but to make the fieemtn of the North
pay this pareha-er ior s'aves which he could not catch.
í will beg leave to give the opinion of the Commis-
sioner ot Indian Afluir  ir. his o.vn, words In a
lettei tj the honorable Secretary oi War, dated
July 1 1840, speaking of thes« nrgrces, he says:
'A'j .n'enp at eniccng a c'aim to them under
me Ciet-k w. rrtois would, peihaps, have resulted
in eonfltc'; and, as ih  hizud of such an issue
pi evented the u-e of more ihan persuasive mean's
I thint Gen°r 1 Wd'wn has a j'ist c'aim en the
tne Uni'ed Sui es for he meney he raid, and inte-
rest "' This, sir, is ihe ¡rgic ot ihe Commi«¡ loner
of I idipn AiTd'rs, and that same opinion is endors-
ed bv tüe boaoratle Secretaty oí War. I have
s'ated, and I think have shown from authentic
document , that the war in Florida originated in at-
tempt- by our Executive cfficeis to support and
mainUm s'averj.; that it has been renewed and
cimed on for that purpose; that the money of
cm nauon has. been paid for the purchase of
fugitive slaves a>.d of Irdnn slave . To these
I now add the fact that tho-e officers deem it just
' at we s-^o^ld pay for slaves which the owcers
cannot oD'am,
When I ob'a ned tne floor, I intended to ca.l the
at entiba oí the committee 'o the manner m which
tip war ws rene.íed a'ier Gen. Macomb's treaty
of pe-ice io 1839. But I have already detained the
committee too long, and I will only say that, if the
public papers are to be accredited, the people of
Florida held meetings for the purposí of protesting
against that treaty, for the na ons ihat it perm'tted
t'.e Indians io lemain in Flor da; and they urged
that the territory <ccup<ed by them would afford a
harbor kh runaway slave . Of course the war was
icnetted, and coat nties, like a mighty maelstrom,
d.awswit ni Us v ¡tex and swahows up the ím-
me.i5e r^soircesof the nation. For a period al-
most eqaal to thtt of our Revolutionary war, the
people cf the fiorihern States have been taxed for
t1 p y-'j-po 0 o' orrry.ngon thi? cun'est, diree'ed
pt.nttpady Pgsmst the fugitive s'aves in Florida.
To th s war toe fee'tngs, the prmcipl s, the inte-
rest , tre honor of the f ee S'ates aie opposed; yet,
<¡¡r, tney have been, aed still are, compelled to
iarni h m ans for us proseeu lop. Revolting es
'he trading in «Uves ¡s to the feeling of our North-
ern people, they h-ve b°et> constrained to supply
tha means of puichssmg their ¡e'low-betngs Hold-
ing, ai the people of the North a), "these truths to
be sJf-evi-c-n', that man is born free, sndis ec-
dowed by his Creator with tbn inalienable right of
liberiy," they hr.va been obliged to furnish money
to r>¿< f ir -he recapture and re enslaving of those
'.,' , fl cog from tha power that oppressed them,
h d sooaht in the wilds of Florida ho«e rights to
which, by t"e laws of Nature and or Nature's God,
tney wete tn it'ed.
Sir, í am anxioos (o s?e a period put to those
anuses of Northern r> his. I desire to see this war
teimiaated at t^e earnest po>i.bi" moment; but I
fear r will not be accempl sued iy tha method pro-
posed by the gentle.pau from Sjuui Carolina. My
o vn cpm on is, that all attempts to remove the In-
< iü is and leave ihe negroes wdl prove abortive.
We ^-e 'ell tnat the negioes control the Indians.
With ihose oegioes, an uncjridit onal surrender to
us wi rid be a voluntary separation from their re-
lati' es ?nd famthes, and slavety for h^e. They
win d probably prefer deam to such an alterna-
tive Of couiss the war will continue until the
nurder of tho«e p~oplp b/ our army ?ha 1 proclaim
peace to Florida, \/ho lefus-'b p^ace upon other
term-. For one, I ^.m piepared to send all who
w.il sm render themselves as prisoners of war to
the Western countiy, under the p!edged faith of
this nation to protect them in. tne enjoyment of their
