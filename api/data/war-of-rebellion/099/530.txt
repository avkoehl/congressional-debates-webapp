This is corroborated by all my brigade commanders, who, with myself, desire only the best interests of the service. On the late campaign in Georgia I found no difficulty in supplying my command and furnished 22,000 rations to needy troops, but at no time had a less per cent. than 5 of my men mounted and never had any of them dismounted. Should this arrangement be broken up my supplies will fall short of absolute necessity.

I am, respectfully,

Major-General.
