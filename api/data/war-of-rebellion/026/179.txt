MARCH 7-9, 1863.-Reconnaissance from Suffolk and skirmish (9th) near Windsor, Va.

Report of Colonel Charles C. Dodge, First Battalion New York Mounted Rifles.
HEADQUARTERS MOUNTED RIFLES,Suffolk, Va., March 9, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of a late reconnaissance at Smithfield, Blackwater, &amp;c.:

In accordance with instructions from general headquarters I started with about 450 of my command and one field howitzer on the evening of the 7th instant for the Isle of Wight Court-House, and thence to Smithfield, where I remained till about 9 a.m. on Sunday, the 8th instant. No enemy were discovered, although the day before Lieutenant-Colonel Taliaferro was reported there with a small party. He had undoubtedly returned across the river by Broadwater or Proctor's Bridge. Making the cross-roads my headquarters, strong scouting parties carefully reconnoitered the vicinity for a circle of 10 miles, but met no enemy. The inhabitants of this district assured us that since Pryor's raid there some two months ago no large force has visited the town. A few mounted rebels occasionally appear, by do not remain any time. I am confident all that district, including Surry Court-House, may be safely considered free from them. From Smithfield we proceeded via Benn's Church to Chuckatuck, where we spent the night. Every effort was made to gain information as regards the enemy and their visits to this place, and our exertion satisfied me that, excepting on one or two occasions, never more than two or three Confederate soldiers had dared to enter the peninsula. These persons came to see their relations, &c., and seldom have done any one injury. I believe, however, forage, bacon, &c., have been sent from there to Zuni and Petersburg in times past, but none whatever can be found now, and the disadvantage of this therefore exists no longer. The guerrillas have burned down the only bridges leading direct from Chuckatuck toward Suffolk or Windsor.

On the a.m. of the 9th instant we were obliged to make a detour of some miles, improvise a bridge, and proceed toward Barber's Cross-
