OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., March 25, 1863.

Brigadier General J. H. MARTINDALE,

Commanding Military District of Washington, Washington, D. C.

GENERAL: From statements made by the following-named rebel officers now confined in the Old Capitol - viz, Captain P. L. Darling, Lieutenants James J. Burch and J. T. McCarthy, Fifteenth Georgia Infantry; W. F. Barrett, White's cavalry, and John A. Billingsley, Ninth Virginia Cavalry - and from the dates of their commitments it appears that they have been exchanged, and if there is nothing on the records of your office to show to the contrary I request you will consider them exchanged and forward them to City Point on the State of Maine. All Confederate prisoners captured in Maryland or Virginia up to November 1, 1862, and all captured at Fredericksburg during the month of December have been exchanged. It appears from the statement of Clagett D. Fitzhugh, First Virginia Cavalry, that he was captured in Maryland on the 14th of September, 1862; that he was transferred from Fort Delaware to this city on the 29th November and that he was paroled from that time to the 5th of January when he was confined in the Old Capitol Prison. If he was captured at the time he says he too has been exchanged and should be sent to City Point unless there is something on the records in your office which would deprive him of the privilege of exchange. He is on the rolls as captain but he denies that he has ever held a commission. It is not a matter of any consequence whether he is a captain or private so far as the exchange is concerned. Please heave separate rolls of these prisoners prepared.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
