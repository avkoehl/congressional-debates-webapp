Eight guns go with the Central road column and two with Charles City column. My line here is all ready. There are no movements of enemy discovered in my front.

I see no reason for recalling General Terry. I am about to send a force (small) on his left to demonstrate. I have ordered him to attack any force outside main works. Prisoners will say that they have only militia on our right. If nothing can be done he will return after dark.
