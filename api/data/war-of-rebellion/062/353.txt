HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF, New Orleans, February 17, 1864.

Colonel E. L. MOLINEUX,Thibodeaux:

COLONEL: It is impracticable just now to send any regiment to Brashear to replace the Ninety-first New York. You will have to do the best you can for a short time with what you have in the district.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

THIBODEAUX, LA., February 17, 1864-1.45 p. m.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

The cavalry have returned from the reconnaissance. Thoroughly scouted the country east of Plaquemine and went as far north as West Baton Rouge. Found only 2 Confederate pickets and captured 1 man. Nothing of importance developed, except the fact of no great force being in that direction.

E. L. MOLINEUX,

Colonel, Commanding.

DONALDSONVILLE, LA., February 17, 1864-7 p. m.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

SIR: The reconnoitering party I sent out some days since under charge of Captain Barrett, of First Louisiana Cavalry, returned to-day. They were unable to go to the points I designated, the junction of Grand River and Bayou Pigeon, and also the junction of Bayou Plaquemine and Grand River, as they found the roads impassable ; but went to Plaquemine and followed the river to West Baton Rouge, and from there struck across the country to Rosedale, on Bayou Plaquemine. In their scout they ran across two Confederate picket-posts, but captured only 1 prisoner, whom I now have here. From all I can learn I think they have not a large force on the Grossetete.

W. O. FISKE,

Colonel, Commanding.
