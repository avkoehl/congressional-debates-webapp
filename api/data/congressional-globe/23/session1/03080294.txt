Bristol, Mmch 10, 1834
Sir   Without deeming n, advisable at the pres
ent time to call a public mcetn °- upt n the °uo]e( t,
and without sohruingaddmoral names nirmkirg
known to otheis this exmession of our sentiment ,
we wish nid vidually to express oui approbation
of your piesent course in Confess  particularly
in relation to the rechartei of the Un ted States
Bank ard the íestoiation of the deposites     We
do not mean to say tin t embarras mci ts m bu«i
ness are not felt heie as in other parts of the ci un
tiy, but it «eims to us id'e to  piolcnd  that the
removal of the depo^iteb could of itself have caused
them without the effective agency of the bulk    We
do not 1 now that the removal was necessary «t the
precise time when it was made  but if a new lea^e
is not to be given to this institution, they must
have been i emovd sooner oi later, ard can see ro
reason why the time selected was not as f ivorrble
to the object "s any othei  time     In our op mon,
the bank has pursued a systematic plan of oxer
qtions against the 1 xeoutive, and a re'u n of the
deposites would be a triumph of the bamc—a til
umph over the Executive and the Government
We dally hear argument" advanced as proofs of the
necessity of a bank, but in this vicin ty no reasons
are offered to our knowledge for the continuance
of the piesentone     We regard all great moneyed
institutions of thiskmdasdargeroosin lepublican 1
governments, and if necessary, are n cessarv evils,
and in our view their dangerous, ter dency is greatly i
increased by duration, by the foothold they gain,*l
the additional power, and the nature of independ
rnt perpetual corporations, they acquire by suc-
cessrv e recharters     We are aware that a few indi   I
viduals in this place, w ho have an interest in it, are
fnendiy to the present bank, but we assure yon
that the friends of the Administration here, gen
erally, are opposed to itsiecharter    We could not
reasonably expect that ítviould diewi houtastrug
gle for life, be the consequences of that struggle to
the country whatut may, and if the present em-
barrassments aie general and serious, it is a proof i
that it can be a terrific engine of ev 1     Ye , hold-

lar instances of individual distress are light and
trifling in comparison with the puuty and perma
nency of our republican institutions, we wish not
to see our lepresentatives flinch and falter at the
^rst exertion of its power   We therefore beg you,

manly tone with which }ou have suppoited the
patriotic views on this subject of the Chief Magis
trate of the nation

Hon Dutee J Pearcc
To the Hon Dvlee J Peat ce
Sir The urdersigned, who constitute a poition
of your constituent, takethis mode bnefly toad-
dress you, and to offer some suggestions on the
present agitated state of the public mind on the
bank question Waiving a detail of leasoiib with
which you are already familiar, v. e are of opinion
that, under pi esent circumstances, the Bank of the
United States cannot, wnl not, and ought not to
be íechartered, " because the proof is abundant,
clear, and irresistible, thatit has fallen into abuses
of its trust, manifold, high handed, and alarm-
ing "
We are further of opu ion that the present em
barrassment of trade, for want of money , is prin-
cipally owing to the fevcnsll state of the public
mind, occasioned moie by political intrigue than
all ot! ei causes put toget ler
The expenerce of the world fully pi oves, that
in all commercial and manufacturing countries the
ebbs and (lows of the money market aie as certain,
though not soiegular,as those of the ocean tides,
and that, in time, either is ceitain to produce the
o her
Our opinion also is, that a bank,whose operations
could be extended throughout the whole nailon,
has heretofore been, and if continued, or another
created by Corgres", would hereafter be highly
beneficial to the country, not only as a fiscal agent
of the Givernment, and a safe and convenient
deposite of tl e (unds of the ti calory, but also an
er-cient aid m the oneiations of the mercantile
in I otl er business classes of the community
Such a bank, wethn k should he entirely above
que tion or doul t as to its constitutionality which
it, not the case with he pi esent United States Bank,
some of tl e al lest statesmen of ihecountry having
insisted on the rontiaiy and, in our opinion, it
should be located somewhere wthmfhe exclusive
territorial jurisdiction of the General Govern-
ment
The bank should be authe ized to establish Us
branches in any, or all of the States of the Union,
provided it could I e done jy an amicable arrange-
ment with the State governments, paying to the
¡several States, where the «ame might be estab-
lished, a reasonable tax, umfoim, and as nearly
equal as possible, so as to yield an income to the
S'a'es, but to be subject to no requisition for
money io the General Government
These suggestions we ofler to your consideration
in the nature of advice, as we do not at all presume
to dictate They are made to you individually,
wuh our permission, however, that you lay them
before Congre s, should you deem it advisable to
do so, but not expieesing any wish of our own in
the last respect
We aie, very respectfully, your friends and
fellow citizens

Mi SpEAKEr I am chained with the presenta-
tion of a memorial and cctam resolutions expres-
sive of the sentiments of my constituents in rtla-
t on to the agitating quest on which has so lo g
o>cupieu the attention of this House A conven-
tion of delegates chosen by the peotle in then
primary assemblies througnoutmv disti ct,adopted
this memonal and these resolutions without a
dissenting voice At this convention more than
two hundred delegates thus chosen were ass m-
bled, and it is fair to presume tnat a majority of
m> cons'iiuerts entertain the sentiments conveyed
to this House through this memorial ard thes"
resolutions 1 have before me the proceedi igt of
someofthe meetings in the county towns at which
thfse delegates wtie chosen, expressive of the
sume sentiments, but in strongei language I
snould have contented myself with the bare pre-
sentation of these pioceedmgs without a single
remaik, if I had not perceived that they had been
publijy arraigned before 1 had an opportunity of
presen ipgthem heie I have perceived also, that
n> the remarks madeon thepresentation ofanother
memorial from my district in the other branch of
Congress, I have been publicly charged wuh mis-
íepiesenta ion I owe it to this House, as well
as to myself, to make an explanation, and 1 ask
permission, Mr Speaker, to do so
Leave being granted—
I Mr p proceeded Before I avail myself of this
| indulgence, it is proper that I should briefly btat'
I tne character of this convention and tl esub tanc«
of the fiemoiial and resolutions I have already
I made mention of the number of delegates that
attended this convention I neednotadd thatth y
were highly íespectable The people who chos 
them in their primary assemblies, have given you
I a sufficient guarantee of their respectability It
1 ma) sometimes happen that, in the circulation of
i memorials for signatures, fictitious names may be
1 placed upon the roll, or genuine ones obtained, by
hand and misrepresentation, but it rarely hap-
pens that delegates, chosen directly by the people,
I will dare to deceive or misrepresent them Sir, it
is with s-ome degiee of pride that I acknowledge a
pet «onal acquaintance with most of these delegates
There are í w, veiy few, among them, who are
veal hy, but there aie many, very many of them,
who, by honest industry, have acquired a compe-
I ter c\, which they aie, no doubt, desnous of pre-
sewing, but «Inch they villi cheerfully surrender,
if necessary, in d(fence of public liberty They
are engaged ir all the great departmen's of human
mdu *ry A arge propoi tion of ihem are employed
in agriculture, an employment which forms the
foundation of national wealth—I had almost said
oFnational vir'ue Some of^them aie engaged in
commerce and manufactures and many of them
are mechanics ard artisans, whose skill and mdus-
,tiv is unsurpassed by any othei people in ary
other section of our country
Su, m order that I may not be aga n charged
with misrepresentation, let me not be misunder-
stood íxs to the political character of this conven-
tion lv was not composed of no party men, nor
was it an assemblage of persons witho it distinc-
tion of perty We have such meetings in the
State of New York by name,butthere is too much
intelligence in the main body of the people, to be
deceived by them We know , then, that when a
call of a mee'irg without distinction of party la
nade, it is to be composed chiefly, if not evclu-
s vely of the opponerts of the A ¡ministration
Thefnendsof the Admn istiation have never dis-
guised or concealed their political names They
aie republicans—they avow therrselvessuch This
convention was a i-publican convention It was
called and convened by that name It adopted
the proceedings I am about to present by that
name, and how ever odious the name may now be
to certain politicians, it wi 1 never become obsolete,
so long as we 11 eserve oui present form of Govern-
ment Let New York and New York politicians
be abused ever so much, a political party wi'l exist
there It has existed evei since the formation of
our Government It existed when Mr Teffeison
was first elected President His political princi-
ples are still fondly cherished m New York by a
political party and it is this party, which, at this
trying time, will be found, as it alwajs has been,
opposed to a i ational bank, and, as a matter of
courc , opposed to the restoration of the deposites.
