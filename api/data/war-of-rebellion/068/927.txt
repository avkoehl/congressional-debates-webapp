HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 19, 1864-1.45 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: The result of the reconnaissance and observations made this morning is as follows: At a point 1 1/2 miles due south from the Myers house is a house owned by Quesenberry. Taking that as a starting point and going a half a mile due south you strike the Po River. Drawing a line southwest from Spotsylvania Court-House you strike the Po again; then drawing a line from the Quesenberry house, a little south of west 1 mile, you strike the Po again, and at that point the enemy's entrenchments seem to end and to run from that point directly to Spotsylvania Court-House. All accounts agree that there are no entrenchments south of the Po. At a point 2 miles southeast of Smith's Mill the Po and Ny unite.
