Winchester, General Carson's at Bath, General Meem's at Martinsburg, and General Bogg's at various points in and near the South Branch Valley. Possibly I may be able to station all in the South Branch Valley, but this must depend upon the movements of the enemy. The cavalry will be distributed along the frontier. I hope to be in Winchester this week, and will at once establish a line of couriers on any route you may indicate. The enemy are still in force on this side of the Potomac 7 miles below Cumberland and 20 miles from here.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. J. JACKSON,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Centreville, Va., January 23, 1862.

Brigadier General D. H. HILL,

Commanding at Leesburg, Va.:

GENERAL: Your letter of yesterday* has been received. I incline to the opinion the troops referred to by you come, not from Washington, but from Bank's, at Frederick, for the purpose of repairing the damages to the railroad at and about Harper's Ferry, and then advancing on Winchester, for the purpose of cutting off General Jackson from that place, which is his true base of operations; but I hope he will yet have time to reach it before the enemy gets there. General Johnston coincides with me in these views. It would well advised of the enemy's movements in that direction. I send you herewith inclosed a telegram relative to the defeat of Crittenden's command. I hope, however, that the news is exaggerated.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.

ROMNEY, VA., January 23, 1862.

Honorable WALTER R. STAPLES:

MY DEAR SIR; I write you a few lines to enlist your influence as a public man in behalf of that portion of the Army of the Northwest now
