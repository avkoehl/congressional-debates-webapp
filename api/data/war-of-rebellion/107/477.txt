Colonel W. H. YOUNG,

Commanding Kentucky Cavalry:

COLONEL: Allow me to congratulate you upon having put the first regiment of cavalry in the field. You have, by great perseverance and energy, succeeded in spite of the many difficulties you have had to contend with the organizing twelve fine companies, all of which are now actively engaged on duty with the various brigades which constitute this army. I trust the Government will duly appreciate the result of your labors.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE STONEMAN,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.

[Numbers 23.]

General W. S. ROSECRANS:

I have had half a regiment up to Painter Mountain beyond Peters Creek, Monday and yesterday. Last night they returned. The enemy has drawn in his pickets and appears to be fortifying Gauley Cliffs near Carnifix Ferry, and the opposite side of the river also. Major Hines, who was in command of ours, rode with a smal number of cavalry into Cross-Lanes. No hostile force was there. I had hoped to make some connection with you west of them. Will try it again to-day. Shall keep ready to act promptly in co-operation with you, but there are twenty-seven miled of very hard road between me and Cross-Lanes. Yours of 9th (not numbered) came last night.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
