small number of cavalry would be sufficient, as the train is reported to consist of not more than one-half of the number of wagons of that preceding it. The force under Colonel Thomas must be far on its way toward Fort Wadsworth by this time, if it has not already reached that post. Colonel Thomas has orders to attack any bodies of hostile Indians he may find along the route or within striking distance of it. The brigadier-general commanding will probably leave to-morrow for Fort Ridgely, on a tour of inspection, and be absent six or eight days. He desires that you continue to keep these headquarters informed of all movements of interest.

HDQRS. DIST. OF MINNESOTA, DEPT. OF THE NORTHWEST,Saint Paul, Minn., September 28, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel C. P. ADAMS,

Commanding Fort Abercrombie:

COLONEL: It has been represented to these headquarters by one of the mail contractors on the route to Fort Abercrombie that it would be consistent with safety to reduce the amount of escort for the mail stages one-half between Alexandria and that post. If you deem that reduction safe and proper you are authorized to make it accordingly. With regard to the force to be retained at Georgetown you will have to be governed by your own views of the necessity of the case and whether or not it will jeopardize the safety of other stations, bearing in mind that no very small detachment should be exposed to attack by greatly superior numbers. The daily information you receive must be your guide in deciding the question of the retention of a force at Georgetown.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND MINNESOTA BRIGADE,Camp, Fort Wadsworth, Dak. Ter., September 28, 1864.

Captain R. C. OLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Minnesota:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report the arrival of my command at this post on the 26th instant. The brief letter of instructions from the general commanding the district has been complied with. Major Rose, with Companies B, C, D, and H, Second Minnesota Cavalry, relieved Major Clowney's command this morning. Major Clowney marches his command with the remainder of this brigade to-morrow morning for Fort Ridgely. We will reach there in nine of ten days with good weather. The mules and artillery horses are very much reduced in condition and will be in numbers, as we cannot procure a pound of forage at this post. The command are very destitute of clothing, as the clothing for posts on the Missouri was detained by low water, and there being no surplus at this post the men have only what is left of the outfit
