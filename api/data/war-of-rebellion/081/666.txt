Instructions issued June 17, 1864, for the contraction of lines before Petersburg:

The movement for taking up the positions decided on yesterday morning will commence immediately after dark, a strong line of skirmishers being left on the present lines to cover the movement until its completion. General Hoke's line, commencing at the rive rand in advance of Taylor's Creek, will follow the ditch behind the race-course, afterward crossing the creek and joining General Johnston's left toward the Baxter road.

General Johnston's line will cross the Baxter road nearly at right angles, thence to the Jerusalem plank road, and from that point following the original lines. He will extend as far west as his numbers permit; one of his brigades will be held in reserve about his center at or near the Jerusalem plank road. General Dearing, with his cavalry, will occupy the interval between Johnson's right and the Appomattox and guard the approaches. The movement will be suspended if the operations of the enemy are such as to render it hazardous.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
