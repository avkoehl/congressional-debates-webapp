Interference in Elections—Mr. Preston.
Senate.
praiseworthy; and such is the language of the re-
pot t itself. Sir, these are extraotdtnary proposi-
tions , and what has brought us to this monstrous
and appalling decision ' Sir, I can welt understand
that in pírrate affans, and in a private way, things
aie done which no man date vindicate in public
affairs, and all know that there has in fact been
interference in the elections by public officers
But never till now has there ever been the open
and daring avowal that the thing is right in prin-
ciple, and that it is one of the political acts of the
country which is expedient and proper, and that
it is desirable that it should be encouraged by all
possible means.
Sir, principles make practice; and still more
fully true is it, that practice makes principles.
Because this thing has been done, the idea of it
first becomes familiar, though abhorred, then it is
seen to be necessary for the support of party, and
now they use up and declare that these practices,
which have heietofore been denounced with epi-
thets fieezing the blood, are founded on conect
principles
Mr. WALL. The gentleman has assumed
things which are not in the report, which I utterly
deny, and which are not true.
Mr. PRESTON. I will show the gentleman
that he denies what is true, and that these prin-
ciples abound both m theaigumentsof Senatois,
and inthefoimal report. If it were not so, I
might not regaid it with the same seriousness I
might think it the temporary effervescence of a
h«ated imagination on the part of the gentlemen
concerned, which, when sober, they would not
sanction. But the doctrines of the report struck the j
approbation of the gentlemen at once, as if by an
electric movement, and they forthwith sent them
abioad Hi thousands of copies; as the foundation
on which the party purpose to place these great
questions. Sir, I confess that I had then made
up no jadgment in regaid to this bill But when
this report was heard, and its principles suddenly
and instantly received the approbation and ap-
plause of gentlemen on the other side, I shiunlc
from it appalled. And every one of those gentle-
men, by voting to print ten thousand copies of
that report, has made it his own, and given it the
«junction of his name.
And, now, if the gentleman will allow me, I
will proceed to show that the principles of theic-
port aie such as I have descubed,and that item-
braces ovei y principle to which I have alluded
Well may he be terrified atsuch a specter, and at
the boiling and bubbling clamors of the decoction
contrived by his own ingenuity But has ho not
said that the punciple of the bill, which is to íe-
stnetthe interference of office-holders in elections,
is wrong in terms, and has not the total rejection
of the bill involved necessarily the ie|Cction of
that principle ? Has he not denied the existence
of any such inteiferenco, and denounced every
part and portion of the bill' But I will not make
a meie statement of the contents of the repoit, I
will give its woids, tpsissimtt verba, its very propo-
sitions.
Ono of its propositions is, that the elective right
of the United States is umveisal, and not con-
fined to any parts or portions of the people, and
therefore it concludes that, as office-holdeis aie
all people and citizens of the United States, this
circumstance guatanties to them the right to be
active m the elections, which cannot be infiinged.
The report says, (page 2:)
"The elective right belongs to representative govern
meat, and springs from its very iratuie, and the veiy cs
s^tice ot that right, under our institutions, i  the right of
electing the members 01 tin. General and Stale Govern
mints "
Here he maintains the proposition that the
elective right is universal, not merely by the Con-
stitution, but fiom the very nature of fiee govern-
ment He thtm places Federal officers on special
grounds in reference to the mass of the people,
putting them above and over them:
' The value and the advantage of this right, so far as re
spects the public depend on the knowledge of public 111 -as
ure  and ol the qu ilihcations of candidates for public trust
and, consequents, upon the equal and unrestricted freedom
of discussing their compar uive merits and dement, The
citizen who, by the cIkhco of his fellow , l3 distinguished
iv being selected lo pei form official dunes and trusts, is not
thereby elevati d above them, nor digraded below them
Heparts with no rights of citizenship, but remains an equal
Among <ajual*¡ still connected with tbeai by the strong and.
enduring ligaments of mutuality of rights and privileges
Under oui Constitution ibe people, not the Government,
possess the sovereignty, and the dnm„ of office em bo
opened only by the powerful chaimofthc public voice,and
no degrading sacrifice ot any of the privileges of citizen-
ship, or any separation from the community of rights, teel
mgs, and lnteiests, which bind the people to the Govern
ment, is required "
Here, sir, the honorable chairman alludes to
supposed grounds of peculiar claims to the elec-
toial right; ansmgfrom the distinction of serving
the public, and of having been selected from the
general mass, and, on the high ground of having
been thus selected, is placed the light of inter-
filing, of persuading and dissuading, in the
popular elections. But the honorable chairman
proceeds
" The object of the Constitution is the protection of the
equal rights and privileges of all—the few a  well as the
many Ihe spirit of despotism is widely different, elected
upon the destruction of the rights of man, its mam object
is to protect the few against the many Hence tilt pohev
of separating its officeis from all sympathy of leehng and
interest with the many, by attaching to orhce attractive dis
unctions and seductive privileges, whieh cieates a distinct
class, and elevates tneui above the mass, or, by degrading
them by unnatural mutilations, below their fellow men,
piepares them to become fit instruments of -ubum v povvei
Despots who sunound ihiir ihrones with eunuchs md
mutes act upon the litter punciple, and are impelled by the
instinct of leai to resort to unnatuial and unjust means to
ret nn whit is uii|iis!lv acquired Happily our institution-.,
resting upon tin lust found ilion of popular rights, neither
di mand nor will limit of the mutilation of the person or
the privileges ot citizenship as a prerequisite tor offici  "
Now, su, it is somewhat difficult to perceive
the couise of reasoning of the honoiablo chan
man [Here Mr P made some remaiks not well
heaid by the Repoiter, in which he was undci-
stood to aigue some inconsistency in theiepoit
in iclation to protecting the few as well as the
many, and to insist that the object and actual
effect of the English election laws was to protect
the many against the few, and that this was pie-
oisely what was now proposed by the hill He
thought the aigumcnt of the report on this point
was greaily confused, even if it was not full of
sophistry ]
But, says the honorable chan man, "the object
of the bill is to lenflei what is lawful and piaise-
worthy, and in stuct confoimily both with the
letter and spnitof oui institutions, foi all citizens,
criminal in n paitieulai class, who hate been hon-
oied bv the confidence of the people of the whole
Slates " Now, sir, 1 hold him to his wouls in
the face of his denial that I had quoted him nghily
Piai&ewoithy ' Piaiseworthy' I have ¡said that
he represented the interference of Federal officeis
in elections as desei ving of eulogy, and has not he
pionounced it piaiseworthy ' 1 «¡aid that he vin-
dicated it, and does he not say that it is praise-
worthy ' What, sn, is the object of the bill' It
is to pievent inteifeience in elections This is not
disputed But the repoit sttvs the ob|cet of the
bill is to lender that illegal winch is piaisewoithy
This inteiference, the bill implies, is wiong, and
demands legislation, but the repoit in teims not
only denounces this, but goes much fuither, by
vindicating such inteifeience, and declaims; it
praisewoithy, thus eulogizing it, while theob|ect
of the bill is declaied odious because it provides
to do away that which is praiseworthy, and the
whole argument of the report goes to this íesult.
But to the extiact-
" The object of the bill is to render what is lawful and
praisevioithj, and in strict conformity with both the letter
and spmt ol our institutions, for all citi/ens, eruninnl in a
particular class, who have been honored by the confidence
of the people ol the whole States It is not to punish a
crime malum i?i se, but to create a new crime It is not to
punish bnheryand corruption,the robbery of the ballot box,
the suppression or lorguig of leturns, or usurpation orneg
hctof ollicial duly m giving effect to the w II ot tin majority
m eti (lions but the use ol persuasion or dissuasion, of m
termed ¡tin* to eontiolor influence voters bv means that are
lawlul and right in others "
The veiy terms which aie used in the bill of the
Senator fiom Kentucky, and this intermeddling
of these officeis is the precise thing which the
gentleman calls praiseworthy.
Sir, let us pause a moment It is not, says the
gentleman, malum m ie, an offense in itself Sir,
the gentleman is a lawyei, and let me ask him, is
there no political offense subject to legislation but
what is mrtiwni wise' Is there any one in the whole
catalogue of political offenses which is malum in
se? If the gentleman should find out that the
battot-box has been abstracted after the polls were
fully made up, is that tiuiw t  se ' Is to offer or
take a bribe malum m Se ' Is it a thing at which
nature revolts as cnminal in itself Sir, all these
are but creatures of the law, conventional crimes,
depending on broad and general punciples, and
yet the Senator from Kentucky is censured be-
cause this thing is notmo/iiniijise. Butthe report
proceeds:
" Every citizen ought to qualify himself by study, con
vernation, and every other means of acquiring knowledge,
to understand the theory and principles of our institutions,
and to asceitain the best mode of administering them ni
their true spirit, so as to promote the greatest good of the
gieaiest nu.nber, and to render himself capable of discharg
nig any trust that may be comerred on him by his teliow-
citizens "
It is then duty to do all, to agitate, to discuss,
to enter into an interference illimitable, m dnect
contact with elections is declared not only to be
praiseworthy by the committee, and good in itself,
but they simultaneously announce that it is not
only right and praiseworthy, but it is a duty, to
make use of patronage and powei m elections, to
take the lead and control them, (for the very woid
control is used.) And now,sn, will the honorable
gentleman tell me that he does not rally the office-
holders to interference in the elections' That he
is not contravening in terms the puipose and ob-
ject of the bill by declaring it the duty of Fedeial
officers to contiol the elections3 And is not this
using a powei of inteifeience m elections, against
which they ought to be fiee'
Butfuithei, sir, the report says:
" 11 is as well Ins right or Ins dut3- to dismiss and promulge
fieelvtiie measmes ot any Administration, and the chaiac
ter and conduct ot thos" who suppoit or oppose it, as well
to control them by the censor bipot public opinion as to
subject them to the test ol the Constitution ''
To control them by the censorship of public
opinion1 The public officer is bound to advocate
or contest against the men and measures of an
Administration, thus controlling them, and work-
ing themselves up into a censoiship of public
opinion, that is, an3' public opinion which may
be held by the office-holders of the count]y, for
that, by the committee, is made the standard to
winch the acts and the character of an Adminis-
tration aie to be íefcrred, that is, to the pubhc
opinion which they make it the duty of the office-
holdeis to establish
lhe leport says further- " In doing so, he may
win the confidence of his fellow citizens"—an
emanation fiom, and a dependant on, the Exec-
utive—" by his declared opinions, or may become
identified with some gieat punciple which concil-
iates their suppor' "
Sn, the repoitnot only declares it his duty, but
furnishes reasons and arguments why he should
go forwaid and endeavor to identify himself with
some gieat principle: and what will that principle
be in fact' The principle of self-preservation—
mybiead, my office, my support: they will be
led by that punciple, and a control ovei the elec-
tions to the great end sanctifying this principle of
self preseivation.
But the gentleman denies that he has vindicated
this inteiference, while in his repoit he says, "'all
this is innocent and praiseworthy " Yes, sir, all
this interference, in every possible way and to
every possible extent, is not only innocent, but
praiseworthy; and further, and more than this, I
have adverted to the usual motive of the inteifei-
ence as a reason why it should not take place and
why > Because that motive is selfish, having no
direct reference whateverto the publicgood But
this reason the gentleman has i ejected He as-
sures us, first, that the motive for interference is
such, and then he vindicates the proceeding on
the ground that the motive is conupt. Hear him:
" All this is innocent and praiseworthy, even if the mo
tive is the acquisition of oliice, because it promotes the
public kood "
All this the gentleman encourages and stimu-
lates to it, for all he saysis not only innocent, but
praiseworthy, even if it is done with no motive
but the acquisition of office Sir, this course of
argument would revolt the mind and conscience
of Machiavel.
Sir, what is the purity and absence of corrup-
tion m our institutions ' What is the great safe-
guard of our lights' What is the broad princi-
ple of suffrage which lies at the bottom of our
institutions' It is puiity of motives, patnot-
ism, and public good, moving and diiectmg the
vote of every citizen.   And yet this report  with
