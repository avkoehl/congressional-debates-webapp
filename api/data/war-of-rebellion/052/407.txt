This has doubtless been done, and Buckner, Johnston, and Bragg are all near Chattanooga. The movement on East Tennessee was independent of mine. Your apprehensions are just, and the legitimate consequences of your orders. The best that can now be done is for Burnside to close his calvary down on our left, supporting it with his infantry, and, refusing* his left, threaten the enemy, without getting into his grasp, while we get him in our grip and strangle him, or perish in the attempt.

General ROSECRANS:

Completed the wire to Wauhatchie Junction last night, but owing to a change of position of Wood's division during the night, was obliged to open communication 2 miles north of that place. Will run the wire up to the railroad toward Trenton soon as the troops are in a position to protect the junction.
