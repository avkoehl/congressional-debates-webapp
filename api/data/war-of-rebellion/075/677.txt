HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,May 8, 1864.

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the commanding general.

This scout has just come in and brought 1 prisoner, who was dressed in Federal uniform, and states he belongs to the First Georgia Cavalry. The prisoner states he was in Cleveland last Tuesday, and states General Schofield's command passed through there on that day; but he thinks consisted of only one division.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY,One mile and a half from Dug Gap, on Villanow,

Dug Gap, and Dalton Road, May 8, 1864-10.15 a. m.

General MACKALL,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: A scout just in reports the infantry of the enemy early this morning were along the line spoken of in my previous dispatch. If moving, they are moving slowly. Their cavalry, however, have advanced beyond the Presbyterian Church spoken of in my previous dispatch, and are nearer Dalton than the church. Another body of cavalry has occupied the Dalton and Villanow road, and are reported only three miles from my pickets. These cavalry forces are reported to be heavy, especially the one on the road leading by the church. This cavalry evidently is to cover the right of the infantry. The cavalry on the Villanow road probably came from Huff's and not through Villanow. I have sent out scouts to ascertain the number, direction, &amp;c., of the cavalry.

Very respectfully,

WM. C. P. BRECKINRIDGE,

Colonel Ninth Kentucky Cavalry.
