Brevet Major-General WILSON:

We have possession of the assets of the Bank of Tennessee. The president, Mr. Torbett, is not in Augusta. Mr. Fisher is expected to-night. They are anxious to return to Tennessee, I am told, and every facility has been extended by other officers of the bank. I cannot learn of the whereabouts of the State archives. They were in Montgomery last winter. Mr. Dunlap and Ray were here last Wednesday, but can find nothing about them to-day. They will undoubtedly report when they arrive in town. All the parties named in dispatch I think are very desirous of returning to their State. Colonel Stevenson, president of Chattanooga and Nashville Railroad, is making out report of rolling-stock, which will be sent as soon as received. Some of it is now used by the Georgia Railroad to transport paroled men. It is ready to move as soon as the road to Dalton is opened. The president and superintendent are both alive to the interests of the company, and there is no necessity of guarding its property. Hope to trail the State archives to-morrow.
