scarce an effort, cleared each line of abatis at a single leap, and, scarcely noticing the ditch, mounted the parapets or poured through the embrasures at the recoil of the guns that their last discharge had opened for them, and their line was broken. Turning the left of my line (which after entering the embrasures had become a column) to the right, and being joined by those who had climbed the parapets, it swept down on their flank with fixed bayonets wit scarcely any opposition, the men throwing down their guns and surrendering, officers waving their white handkerchiefs and delivering up their swords. Here for the first time I discovered the left of the skirmishers of the division of the Thirteenth Corps did not connect with my right, but had made an interval of some eighty yards and having a greater distance to pass over than my line had not yet reached the works. Fearing that the enemy's line in their front might, with those who had escaped from my column, discover our weakness and give us trouble, I pushed on down the line, so that the enemy might not have time to recover from his panic, and found that my right had already captured the men and guns at the center fort and the infantry support on its right, most of the left having run down the ravine to the rear and for the time escaped capture. A portion of the Thirteenth Corps having now arrived, and all resistance at and end and prisoners all secure, I halted my command, reformed them, and rested the men till I received orders to join the brigade. The distance from my right, where it left the picket-line to the point where it struck the enemy's works, is 550 yards, and the length of works captured 560 yards. I am unable to give the exact number or rank of prisoners captured by my command, as the success of the assault depended on its being rapidly followed up after the line was broken and leaving the prisoners and trophies in other hands, which was done. I cannot, however, do justice to my command, in fixing the number of prisoners captured by them at less than 800, being one entire brigade and two batteries, 800 stand of small-arms and accouterments, and 8 pieces of artillery, as follows, viz, one 30-pounder Parrott carriage and limber with chest; one 7-inch siege gun with carriage; six field pieces with limbers. List of casualties.* The conduct of both officers and men, during the assault and after the works were carried, was unexceptionable. All seemed to know what was to be done, and vied with each other in doing it first. Not a man faltered or deemed himself incompetent to accomplish the task. To Lieutenant John E. Thorpe, acting adjutant, Tenth Kansas Veteran Volunteer Infantry, I am indebted for the general direction of the colors and his efficient services in conveying orders under the most difficult circumstances, and to each officer whose name appears above, I wish to make special mention for the cool and systematic manner with which they executed my orders and handled their men. To them I am greatly indebted. To each soldier I owe much for the success of the assault, and, would space permit, I would mention each by name.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. HILLS,

Lieutenant Colonel Tenth Kansas, Commanding Second Brigade Skirmishers.

Lieutenant W. G. DONNAN,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, Second Brigadier, Second Div., 16th Army Corps.
