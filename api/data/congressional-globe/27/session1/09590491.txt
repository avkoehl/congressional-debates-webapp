Bankrvpt Bill—Mr* Underwood.

will be left to he app'ie 1 within the year to appreciation*, oi
charges, fur cui rent service This would be to apply, monthlv,
tu the public sei vice, fn the lest lot, of the veai, $1,570 000-
lcafl thin two millions And tms is complained of as extrvva
eant b i gentlemen wh > have themselves made the appropna
ujiib, and who, by their own Ad rn mi nation, expended moio
than an equivalent hum in eaeh of the fii->t two niontt s oí the
ypai, to b ly nothing of the exptndiaues of that Adminmi ation
iu na>t yeai =    .
Weil, &n, m spite of the lamentations of o ir economical
fuend-,on the other ¡nde thelreasury will be called on to pay
for curre it <=etvice in the remainder ol the year from the 4th
ofMarüi, the sum of £19,700 000 and including the redemption
of Treasury notes, the sum of $Zi 210 000, and the question now
is what has the f lea^ury got, or what will it h ive. to meet this
demand?
The Secretary says that his means, all told, including all he
can raise by the i*eue of Treasury notes for the tea months.
will not exceed $20 730 000
But as gentlemen thought it necessary to impeach the Secre
tarv'& statement of the amount tobe paid, so, on the other hand
they think it equally incumbentont em toimpeich hisc8timatp
of means I shall leave gentlemen to make the most of this
imneachment They almit that the feecretary u, about as
capable as themselves of estimating his meant-, and yet they
ofiet their ciude conjectures m reeard to the íeceipts into the
Tteasury,and, so far as I now remember, without one material
or important fact to redeem their calculations from the cha
racfi of mere i11p conjectures And it is on such anunsta^e
foo mg that gen lemen are content to put thernbelves when
they stand up here, in the taceot the who e country, to oppose
a measure which is demonstrably necessary to save the Trea
suiy from discredit, a d the country from hishonor
Well, sir, let us come to the unshot of the mattei
The Tieasury must pay, in ten months, the sumof $¿4210.000
Apd the S^eretaiy finds that his means, all told,
will not exceed the sum of                                        20730 000
And the deficit is shown to be                                •       3,480,000
But it must notbe forgotten that of the means eati
mated by the Secretary, thesuniofbix millions
of dollars and upwaids is the proccei s of Tiea
sury n ites, which wi I be outstan hng at the
cl seof the year This sum will then be a debt
which must be added to the deficit as found
aoove        -                       -                      •           -        6,030,000
Making together
GoOOOO
We have, then, a debt, found exiting at the close of the
prehentyear, contracted under the legislation of the late \dmi
nistrafion, for current service only, amounting to nine millions
and a half of dollars And it isfoi thi& debt amongst other ob
jects that tie loan proposed by the pie-em bill is intended to
piovide
The plain statement whick I have now made is sufficient to
demonstrate, at once, the necessity of this loan, and the neces
sity of this called sessnn of Confess '1 Iipnece ^fy ofmalnn°-
this call at an early period m the yeai is abundantly shown by
th*1 feecre'ary, m the exhibit v\l ichhc malíes of what muct have
been lie lelin^uentstateof the freasuiy on the 1-st of September
next,if such call had not been made Mybucfhotu will not
a'low me 1.0 go into this exhibit, which, like evety thing else
fiomthe SecreUiy, has been vi lentty ass oled I adopt the
Secietaiy's statement, which Í believe could be ¡shown to be de
monstiably accurate, if there was time for such a demonstration
Here, as elsewhere, the ¡secretary had found, fio^i the proper
an 1 responsible officers and depaitments, the demands which
would be Ule y to come upon the lreasuiy for the public
eeivice for the limited time stated through them, and on such
information, not to be controlled by the ^-ecietaiy, his state
ment is undoubted!} ba-,ed—at least pro tanto I say I adept
the statement, and with it, th* position so much derlaimuí
against, that the deficit which would be found on the Ut Sep
timber in the Tieasury if it would notequal would appioach
the amount of deficit which the statement show woul I &taud
agLitot the Tiea&ury at the en 1 of the year All this demon
btiateb the imme late and pressing necessities of the Treasuiy,
in consequence oí the condition in which it was left by the last
Administration, m spite of alliemonstiance on this flooi the
last winter, and the impeiative demand loi this eaiiy and extra
ordinary mee ing of Congiess
flus session of Congress havmg been called some new ex
penséis nece^anly incurred, and it is proposed, also, that this
opportunity blidll not pah¡> away without attempting ..orne fui
ther leai lation made indispensable by the warton neglect of
the last Administration That Administration refused last wm
ter to appiopua'e money even for airearages ol pay to troops
employed by it m Florida andiefused to make an; alcqnate
appiopnations foi f jrtificattons and armaments These were
gieatan 1 flagrant delinquencies hv which the public honoi and
the public ~afety weree-mipromiMjd and it i  the fir^t and high-
est duty of the Government in new hand*! to meet the cyi
gency at the earliest, opportunity, and apply the proper coi i ec-
ttveand remeda
The War Department ha^ proposed, therefoie, newappi >pu
ations, to the amount of about two millions and a half I! this
amount he added to the nine and a half millions, men íon^d a
l'utle while ago, we have twelv« milluns of dolíais foi which it
is perfectly evident thelua-=my is nor piovided with any
means
There is another exigency oí the Iieasury, which if met as
it ought to be, would a id fout millions to the amount f r which
extraordinary means ought now to be proviied I allude
of course to that necessary suiplus which all Secreranes I
behe\e, have agieed m stating ought to remain in the Trea
eury
But I go no further with this argument It is not mere!} a
question of debt oi deficit, it is a question of public bankrupt
cy, and of public disgrace It is clear that without the aid ot
this bill the Treasury cannot meet the legal and proper de
manisuponit Expendituiesmust be arrested without law
and against law, oi the Treasury must stop payment And jet,
in th face of this imperative demand on our justice and oui
honor gentlemen propose, arfaras their votes «an go, to refuse
this loan And why1* How will you meet this public deb "Í
What will you do with if*

Well, it must not be forgotten that the object of this bill is to
pay debt- , not to create them, and I do not know how to un ler
«tand this objection to pay the del ts of the nation becatic-e it
leads to taxation of this Government, if it do not refei itscif

would submit to the unjust and unequal operation of this Go

Mr Chairman, we have had on this and on many occasions
some'hmgtoo much oí this predicted dissolution on this flooi
Now we, in the higher laiiti les, ate apt to think that the
South—(it is only apart of the South and a small pat t, too, that
complain of the Union)—has had, and is likdy to have, a^much
benefit out of the Union as the fsorth We do not think you
can afFinl to part with it, we know we cannot And we
believe that om interests aie not diverse, as some seem
to suppose, but rat lie 1 identical And yet, for one, I am

Teere is a v«ry l'rge porti"", >t not a rna)nnty of
the American peop'e, who have no fa th in that
poHay woich toll rates Govera'neet in interfering
wtih the rights of individuals, founded upot con-
trae s freely and voluntarily made.   The sentiment
in favor, ot requiring individuals t < perform their
engagements according to the law!> in force at the
date of the centract his been, dbd yet is, very
strong in Kentucky. The lavas under which con-
trac s- are made, cois'itu'e their obliganon; and to
these laws do the people look for tha' enforcement
of their contraes, In Kentucky it has been set-
lied, alter «contest which  gi ated and >-xeited the
intellects and passions of ihe pe 'pie for years, that
the Legislature of the S ate cannot change the re-
medy for the enforcement of comracis, «o a* to de-
lay ihe creditor, without violating that provision of
the C msiituuon of the United States which prohi-
bit the Stites from "impairing ihe obi gation of
contrac s " I was not an idle spectator ofthe new
and old court controversy, as it was called, m Ken-
tucky, and I adveit to it merely to show the deep
interest wh'ch will ever be felt in any legislative
action which interferes with the contracts of the
citizen     History teaches wisdom by ex imple.
In this bill yon do not pr >pose 10 delay the cre-
ditor for a time; but you determine to cut the obli-
gation of the contrae', and to dichar^e the debtor
entirely. I think you have ihe constitutional power
to do it. That power has been expressly given to
this Government by that clause of ihe Constitution
which auhonz's Congress to pas's "uniform laws
on the subject of bankriptctes throughout the
United States," and it has been expressly prohibited
to the Sta'es in that clause which declares that no
State ihall pass any bill or law "impairing the ob-
ligauon ot con'raets " 15ut I did not rise to enter
into any constitutional argument. My purpose is
to poini oui the defects of the bill, which ought to
be amended, and must be before I can vote for it.
You provide, in the first sccnon of the bill, for
a trial bvjury to ascertain the fact of bankruptcy;
and it h dfclared ' if such person (meaning the
bankrupt) shall reside at a ?reat distance from the
place of holding court, the judge, in his discre-
tion, may direct such trial by jury 10 bs had in the
county of such person's residence." How many
m'les constitute "a prear distanoi?" Fifty, one
hundred, or two bundled? The jud^e will settle
it. But I assure you, Mr Chairman, if the good
psople of my S'ale are dragged as witnesses fifty
or a hundred miles to Frankfort, where the Fede-
ral Court mis, to testifj relative to the affairs of a
bankrupt, who may be unable to pay them one
cent, (and your bill makes no provision for their
compensation, there will be great dissatisfaction,
lb ; you to .vrund it. Give positive directions
that the tml &l all take place in the county where
the bankrupt resides There may be influences to
have parces and witnessei collected together in the
pre>enee of the court. The jndjte may conclude
that he can hate the business more correctly done
in court tnan out of it, and therefore, for the sake
of justice, the trial must take placem his- presence.
To such reasjp.t.g the lawyers of the court and
tave-nkppptn around it «ill certainly not object.
I'll" effect of a'l this is expense and trouble upon
ihe citizens, and profit to the lawyer and tavern-
keeper.
The second «ection of the bill enacts:
"th it all lt>x!in£iand ct insarüons by and with any bank-
mpi, b<na fide na ie ami entere 1 into more thin two months
b irm the pciuion itM igimst him ur by hiin,*shi|l not be in-
vali Hted or affUfp t by tins act Viondfd That the other
p irty to anyiurhdealmgo 01 tran actions had no notice of a
pnoi orof biiikiii] "v, or of the intention of ihe binkiuptto
take iht benefit of this a t "
Under this section, ihe purchaser of property
from tie binkmpt wuhm two months be/ore the
prption i filed, may be deprived of the property,
al hmsh he ha-> p'Jtd for it in good faith, upon
pioving that he hai not ce of a prior art of bauk-
ru 4cv, or lhat ihe bankrupt had the intention to
t<iae he bentfit of the act. Will the people know
what ¡xv no's o' bankrup'cy? Tney wll not un-
d<-rstan 1 this new syMem, at least for a time. The
ef i'fqnence may be, wi h full knowledg' of an
an of bankrup'cy, amaimay m good faith pur-
<"ias" piopeily, and [ay the bankrupt for it, and
a it i>"ard  lose both mor ey and propprty by the
operation of this section. Sir, when yr u come to
t^ke advan'age of honeM ignorance, under this
sect on, for the benefit o! the creditors ot a bank-
rupt, }cu will hear (urs"« upon your legislation,
deep and loud, from tho^e who suffer by it, and
their fnends.   I pray you, amend the bill m this
