wounded in the face. I have lost the old white horse. Colonel Ryan is killed; my staff is all tired out. Can you not send me from the trains some ammunition, say five wagon loads, and what ambulances can be spared; I have none in the train. My position is good enough if I am not attacked in some unprepared point on my flanks. I incline to think, though, that if I let the enemy alone he will me. I cannot gain Spotsylvania Court-House with what force I have. You can best judge whether I can be spared more assistance from General Sedgwick by being informed of our necessities elsewhere. I would like to have it from both Sedgwick and Hancock. I am out of ammunition.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

White I am writing the reports of my officers come in such that I need re-enforcement. I dare not fall back, for then I shall disclose my feeling of weakness.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 8, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

Sedgwick's whole corps is sent to join you in the attack on the wing. Wilson sends word he has taken prisoners from both of Longstreet's divisions. It is of the utmost importance the attack of yourself and Sedgwick should be made with vigor and without delay.

GEO. G. MEADE.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 8, 1864-2 p.m.

General WARREN:

Ammunition will be sent you at once. Ingalls is attending to it.

MAY 8, 1864-2 p.m.

General MEADE:

I see no changes in the enemy's force. No firing to speak of, except with artillery, and of that but little. I am picking up a little ammunition, and dividing out that of those that have not fired much away with the others. Prisoners say Longstreet is wounded. I will do my best to smash Longstreet up when General Sedgwick comes.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.

I feel the less apprehension of an attack than I did after considering the matter from my own point of view. The rebels are as tired out as we are.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
