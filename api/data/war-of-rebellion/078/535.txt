CHATTANOOGA, September 30, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Wartrace:

Move on with your force to Tullahoma and feel with your cavalry for the enemy toward Fayetteville and Larkinsville.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

WARTRACE, September 30, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

General Granger telegraphs that Forrest passed through Fayetteville night before last en route to Decherd. Telegraph at Decherd silent; the operator may have run away or enemy may have captured him. Milroy has sent a train with guard to ascertain the true state of things. Our cavalry is ordered to scout country in all directions, and developments will report. The impression is that Forrest will strike near Decherd. Believing the wires are tampered with I have been careful to telegraph nothing that would aid enemy.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, September 30, 1864-11. 30 a. m.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Wartrace and Tullahoma:

Your dispatch this a. m. received. We must do the best with what we have. Have your cavalry observe Forrest closely, and keep me advised of his position and movements as often as you learn anything new.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

WARTRACE, September 30, 1864.

General THOMAS:

I have reliable information that Forrest was in Fayetteville yesterday morning; he may return to the other road, though I think it more probable that he is resting his command and gathering conscripts. Road all right to Tullahoma. The necessity for a large cavalry force is apparent; nothing decisive can be done without it. Last dispatch received all right.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, September 30, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Tullahoma:

Your telegram of 1. 45 just received. Did you leave any forces in Pulaski? If so, how many? Threaten Forrest from where you are, so as to delay him from striking the railroad as long as possible. I hope
