GRANTS TO POLISH EXILES.
Mr YOUNG said that some days since the
Senate, at his motion, had adopted a resolution
of inquiry, whether the conditions on which cer-
tain giants of land in Illinois were made to Polish
exiles had been complied with, and a response
had  been given by the Department, which was
punted, and was now lying on our tables     It
seemed fiom this document, that a selection had
been made by the agent of the exiles, but it had
not been confirmed by the Department    They
were allowed, by the terms of the grant, to select
thirty six sections fiom three contiguous town-
ships, upon condition that they would go upon
the lands, and occupy them for ten consecutive
years, at the end of which time they were to re-
ceive patents upon the payment of $1 25 pel acre,
the minimum puce of ti e Government, that four
yeais and upwards of the time limited had gone
by, and that there was not, according to the ln-
foimation he had received, a single Polish exile
in that part of thecountiy   He further i emarked
that the agent of these exiles had so located their
claim as to include eighteen miles on each side of
i Rock river, embiacing the finest portion of the
country, and in many instances lnteifenng with
I the impiovements of the settlers, who would be
I greatly ¡mjudiced by a confiimation of the selec-
I tions of land as made by the agent, that another
difficulty had occmrtd by the location of several
floating Indian  reseivations on a part of these
same 1 ends  which, ha\me: been apptoved by the
Piesidcnt, fuithei legislation had become neces-
sary to enable all the parties conceined to under-
I stand then  respective rights under the circum-
stances alluded to, that, m his judgment, whatever
' right these exiles may have had to an exclusive
i occupancy ot these lands, undei the act of Con-
I giess parsed for then benefit in 1831, that that
light had become forfeited by reason of tbeirfail
' uie to comply with the conditions of the act, m
1 not occupying the lands, as, is required    He con-
cluded by moving a refen nee of the icpoittothe
