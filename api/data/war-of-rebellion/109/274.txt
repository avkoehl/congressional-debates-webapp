Send a messenger to olonel Metcalfe andorder him tojoin you. General Wallace will move in direction of Crab ORchard as soona s practicable. I thik there must be mistake as to strength of enemy this side of gap. You will remainuntil metcalfe joins you and watch the movements of the enemy.

LOUISVILLE, August 22, 1862 - 2 a. m.

Major- General WALLACE,

Lexington;

I do not think the information reliable; it is gretly exaggerated. I have no doubt about this. Will send you one or two regiments to - morrow (must mean to- day, 22d,- Operator). The home gaurds are almost useless- an incumbrance. If Governor Tod sends troops yuou will have ample force. I do not know enough of the locality, but think it likely desirable to send a force to Big Hill and hold. I do not believe there are 5,000 rebel troops this [side] the gap; probably not half that number.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
