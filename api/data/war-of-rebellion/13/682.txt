RICHMOND, VA., August 4, 1862.

In reply to inquiries as to whether I saw Major General J. B. Magruder during the battle of Malvern Hill (July 1) and what I noticed of his deportment, &amp;c., on that occasion, I have to say-

I saw him in the immediate vicinity of the engagement about the time of its opening and spoke to him. Noticed nothing unusual in his manner or deportment, except the expression of anxiety in the bringing up and disposition of some troops just then going into the fight. His manner seemed to me deliberate and earnest. I saw him again after the lapse of a couple of hours. His manner betrayed to me on excitement or want of self-possession beyond the ordinary excitement of the battle-field. I saw no disposition on his part to screen himself from the enemy's fire. On the contrary, heard remarks about his fearlessness.
