Major-General BANKS,

As Winchester or Washington:

I beg to acquaint you that General Hartsuff's brigade has moved here to-day; that General Ricketts' will follow to-morrow, and that General Shield's division is now in Front Royal, where I will thank you to support him, in case it should be necessary, until he can be withdrawn. The fords of the Shenandoah are now practicable, all General Bayard's brigade having passed over.

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Manassas, June 17, 1862.

Major-General SHIELDS, Front Royal:

The major-general commanding directs that you take every measure to prevent the approach of the enemy upon you during the time you remain at Front Royal. Send out your cavalry force some 10 or 15 miles. Require them to be on the alert night and day, and at least half to have their horses saddled and ready for action; that they throw out their parties well to the front to give timely notice of any approach of a hostile force. Establish some on the Chester Gap road far enough to keep watch on any party that may be sent against the road between Front Royal and Thoroughfare Gap. Keep your force constantly in hand ready for service at any moment. General Banks has been requested to support you if you should need it.

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
