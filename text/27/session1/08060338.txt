APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL QtOBE.
Sept. 1841.
27th Cong.......1st Sess.
Fiscal Corporation—Mr. Archer.
Senate.
in the progress of this discussion To my mind ilia perfectly
clear, unless it can be successfully maintained that a sound cui
lency Is not necessary to a well regulated commerce We are
lovers of paradox, but thm proposition will scarcelv find an ad
vocate The plain common sense of the matter is, that is soon
as a nation advances beyond mere barter, currency is to com
merce what the tools ofa mechanic are to his trade
1 proceed to consider the remaining part of the first generil
proposition which I have stated    It presents the question—
2   Willthecoiporation conternplated by tins bill bead<quate
to the purposes lor which it is proposed tofcreateu?
Sir, it will furnish a saie depository for the public moneys,
which it is theduty of Congiess to provide Tor then security
under its guardianship, you have the guarantee of individual
interest, of individual responsibility to the extent of the private
capital, of the checks which will be afforded by its administra
tive organization, and of tae fidelity of those to whom the
management of its affairs will be enti usted, who will be btlect
ed With the jealous caution which the personal interest of the
stockholders will necessanly induce this is true, confining
our view to the private duectois Those appointed by the
Government will affoid additional security to the public But
the most satisfactory gutu antee for the bafety of this deposito
ry is to be found in oui past experience The late national m
stitution, in which all the safeguauls piovided by this bill weie
not found, continued, during the teun created by its ehartei,
to perform this service with perfect fidelity, and no loss was
sustained by the Government This single (act afloids a di ci
sive answei to all the apprehensions which have been exprés
ed on this subject.
It will afford the requisite facilities for the transfer and dis
bursement of the public moneys On this subject, also, we
may confidently appeal to the history of the j ist Its bith,
receivable every wheie in payment of the public dues, wi'l f11
mahasoundcuirency to the extent of us circuluion, and,
beyond this, it will exercise a salutary influence ovei the cm
rency¡ by its capacity, as a collector of the pubht moneys ml
from its other means, to check the exces&ive issues of the State
institutions
It Will regulate and reduce the price of exchange, and fin
nish a safe means of collection and remittance tinougliout the
country It can do this, because it will enter the bill market
with peculiar advantages, derived fiom the extent oí us means,
and the number, connet tion, and location ofitb aeencies ¡ae
nators express an apprehension that these cucumslaru ts, by
Riving to this corporation the control of the mark* t, will enable
themtodemandextravagantpremiums Phey forget that the
advantages which I have enumerated while they furnish the
means of successful competition on qualteims with any oihu
dealerin exchange, are mefiictual to stem earn uopoly <u tx
travagantrates, and they fail to remember, tven if an h a
course were piacticable, that the motive to result (oSit is taken
away by the limitation ol the rate ol dividends, and liie obliga*
tion to pay into the public Treasuiy any cxcc&s of profit  be
yowl the amount necessaiy to produce it
In those States tn which the «in rem y is sound, the bills of the
loeal institutions being convertible mto^pme ai the will ot the
«elder, the faculty aecoided to this institution ot dt 1I1114 in
exchange will piobably tmble it to meet the wmts ot the
community Increased banking facilities, by loans and di«
counts, are not what they requue so mueh as arh apand se-
cure means of collection and lemutance, bevond the limns of
the State. That means will be furnished by this corporation
In those States in which the local cunency is uot convertible at
will into specie, the resumption of specie payments, to which
other causes are, I trust, contributing their influence, will be
facilitated by the establishment oí this institution tHieh wu>
the admitted effect, even in its earlier existence, ofthp la e
Bank of the United States, under circumstances in many le
specta similar to those by which we are sunoumled Such, I
doubt not, will be the tendency of the institution which this  bill
§ropo8es to establish Atpiesent, the bills of the suspended
anks, though irredeemable in specie, constitute the nuasuie
of value within the range of their cm «Hi urn The intro Jurtion
ofa sound currency would correct this This iriedcumblu pa
per would still circulate, but until it wis convertible into ape
cie that circulation would heat a iafe ot dcprtuitKn which
would express us true vil tie The elkct, 1 piesinne would he
that solvent banks would be induced to resume speuepiy
mentí, and those whose issues and other liabilities wen. beyou I
thefr means ofredunpit m, w >uld spe*>dilylbc put m a ploceos of
liquidation
The banking facilities afforded by the local institutions by
loans and discounts would be mciea^d At piecnt, their
means are, toagrtat exient, diverted from this object, and em
ployed in the business of exehange If I am runt in <mppos
ing that they would not be able umnini tin a sutussful com
petition with the corporation which it is the pmprse of this
bill to establish as dealers in exchange, they would retire f om
the bill market, and would nectssmly extend thru disc unt
lino, the whole husmea of local di count being r\ehi<iively
open to them But, waiving these sj eeilatums I piefer in
determining the question we lie consideiing-, (which is w'he
ther thiscorr-cmtK n willte ideq utt to the put| 1*  J r f ns
creation,) 101 e«on to the testimony of ma Hist iu mcichuits
and practical (manners i have sought inioimation fiom
these sources, and am en ibled to give to iht Senile the fu!U t

as will ensui e the taking 1 f its stock With this pr ictical evi

Sec&nd I am next to considei the idvariUse which tie 1 ill
under consideration presents m tor finm^ the proponed corno
rationto the business of exchuige In the eailiei di cussions
on this subject, it was earnestly pi üs=ed u 1 on us b\ those who
denied the constitutional power off r^iess i0 p-isS the bill
which was reported by the Senator fiom Kentucky tint the
power of establishing branches in the several Sate*, for the
purpose of local discounts, without then assent, was not au
thonzed by our constitutional charter The {.ower 11 c-eate a
fiscal agent which should be adequate to the purposes of the
Government in the collection, safekeeping, and disbursement
of its revenue, and to invest it with authority to eetahh.h
agencies m the States for the purpose of dealing in exchange
m «3 own discretion, was distinctly admitted In terms eqi ally
stiong we weie urged not to trench upon the ground now ex
elustvely occupnd by the State ins unions—that of discount
in  local papei—and thus to awaken their jealousies in lela
tion to the proposed coiporaüon    We were told that hostility
ten would thus be tngendeied at the moment of lis bn h, and
would ittend it at cvtry successive ( eriod of its exi tenc<
We weie leminded tliar it was this power oflocal discount
which enabled the late Bank of ihe United States undei  en
(um^tanceo peculiarly ikjuuous to the public, to mciea^e or
dimmish the circulation of the countiy, thus raising ot de
pnseiner the v due of iioperiy at 1 s will, ami that it waj to
the   am'ne exente of this powei by Ihe fctate msutn ins
which succeeded it that all its embaí raiments were to be at

SPEECH OF MR. ARCHER,
Or VIRGINIA
In Spnate, Spjitembei 2,1S4I —O i the bill to establish a Fiscal
Corpoiation
Mr AKCHEUsaid that he was fully awaie that he addressed
tht senate at an unpropitimis moment when then minds were
alieady weaned with the discussion ot the general «nrjerL of a
fiscal institution He had had no design lodoso, nor should he
now have uttered a word, but for the peculiar posit 1 n 11 which
he was placed It was known to the Senate that he had leen
opp rsed tn both the bills heietofoie propose 1 lor the e<nh] sh
mentof a fiscal agency connected wiihi'ie Guvutm 111 and he
had nevertheless, avowed his dete ruination tn vote in favor of
the pitsent hill A regard, then to his reputation for consis
encv, rendered it due n >l only to himself buttohiscmstituents,
that he should pies-nt the material reison^ explanatory of the
cour e he should puisne on tin** occa ion in nomg «0 it was
his purple to addiess himself almost exclusively to a < onsi le
ration of the constitutional question prtsented by die bill a
tew prelimirary rernaiks, howevei, were iequiud«sn iioduc
toiy to that discussion
It bad been said very tiu'y during thedebafe that the public
mind had, for a series of } ears, been occupied m a peculio 1 de
gree with fhe disordered condition of the cm u rev oí the conn
trj, and with inquiry as to the bet mode ot remtdyirg (his di
order tinoush the ai tion of the Tedeial Government In fat t,
this had almost been the absorbo a: question of the time It may
(said Mr A ) or it may not have been the principa! íesue m the
latePrtsidential camas-s, whethei we should have a Bank of
the United States but none can deny that the issue every where
was on the tondition of the t urrencyand the appropriate reme
dy through tht action of the Government Reduced by analy
sis, the questions, as 1 expected this action, were but two wl e
ther the Government =hall exercise its power to collect keep,
anddisbuise the public revenue by individual agency, m the
form of the late Sub Treasuiy law, or by means of corporate.
