platform a law for him and them committed them-
selves and him against directly or indirectly
interfering with slavery in the States where it
existed, or the property, peace, and security of
the people of any of them, which he, as he said,
so repeated only to impress upon the public
attention the most conclusive evidence of which
the case was susceptible, that the property, peace,
and security of no section were to be in any wise
endangered by his Administration; thus, ad-
mitting, not only that .slavery is included in the
domestic institutions referred to in that portion
of-such platform, and thathecould nothave been
elected, but for his often-expressed devotion to
the principles therein enunciated before his nom-
ination, and for its being known to those who
nominated and elected him that he " had never
recanted them." He, in that inaugural, more-
over, stated that all the protection which could
consistently with the Constitution and laws be
given, would be cheerfully when demanded for
any cause whatever;and moreoverdeclared that—
" When hostility to the United States in any interior
territoiv .shall be so great and so universal as to prevent
competent resident citizens from holding the Federal of-
fices, there will be no attempt to loree obnoxious strangers
among people that object. Whiie tile strict legal right may
exist lor the Government to enforce tlie exercise of these
offices, the attempt to do so would be go irritating and so
nearly impracticable in that that I deem it better to forego
lor the time the uses of such offices."
Doubtless to assure the people of every section
that he was so apprehensive of the results of the
critical condition of the country that he would
not, where in any interior country the hostility
of the people was so great and universal against
the Government of the United States as to pre-
vent resident citizens from holding the offices,
force obnoxious strangers on any people that ob-
ject, and that he deemed it better for the time to
forego the uses of such offices, and as if fearing
that although his pledge was to every State in the
Union most unequivocally, that on account of pre-
viously expressed adverse sentiments, and like
political affinities, it might not be satisfactory to
the people of the slaveholding ones, especially
those of the seven States that were then as fully
and completely as now m rebellion; as the crime
of the act became as complete, though not so ag-
gravated, by their renunciation of the authority of
the Government, and their making preparations
forcibly to resist it, as by their doing so with armies
for any length of time, he adds " as cheerfully to
one section as another," and continued, saying,
" I take the official oath to-day with no mental res-
ervation, and with no purpose to construe the Con-
stitution and laws by any hypercritical rules."
an assurance to those of all the States of every
section of the Union, and each of them, of such
and equal protection, and, too, doubtless think-
jn^ that on such account either that the inhab-
itants of the slavholiiing States, or many of
them, or many of the most sagacious, prominent,
and influential of his supporters or both would
not be satisfied that he regarded either such por-
tion of the platform or ins emphatic exposition
thereof and of the Constitution as embracing or
having reference to the rendition offugitive slaves,
he continued thus:
"There is much controversy about delivering up of fugi-
tives fiom service or l:ibor. The clausc t now read is as
plainly written in the Constitution as any other of its pro-
visions : ' N'o person held to service or labor in one State
under tile laws thcieof, escaping into another, shall iu con-
sequence of any Mich lavV or regulation therein be dis-
charged from *ueh service or labor, but shali be delivered
up upon claim of such parly to whom such labor or ser-
vice is due.'"
And then said it is scarcely questioned that this
provision was intended by those who made it for
the reclaiming of what we call fugitive slaves; and
the intention of the lawgiver is the law that all
members of Congress swear their support to the
whole Constitution, to this provision as wellasany
other; and that to the proposition, then, thatslaves
whose cases come within that clause should be
delivered up, their oaths were unanimous, and con-
tinued thus; now, if they would make the effort
in good temper, could they not with nearly equal
unanimity frame and pass a law by which to keep
good that unanimous oath, holding not only that
the provision was as plainly written as any in
the Constitution, ihut it applied to therendition of
fugitive slaves, that they should be delivered up,
was the unanimous oath of all members of Con 
gress? • But added, could they not, ifthey would,
make the effort in good temper, with nearly equal
unanimity, pass a law by means of which to keep
good that unanimous oath; and notwithstanding
his declaration in that inaugural that all professed
to be content in the Union if their constitutional
rights could be maintained, and his not impugn-
ing their motives for such professions, though
stating that their apprehensions were without rea-
sonable cause, and that though he did not con-
sider it necessary then to discuss those matters
of administration about which there was no spe-
cial anxiety or excitement, thereby holding no
other matters of administration in such crisis
worthy of comment in his inaugural than those
relating to the provisions of the Constitution and
portion of the Republican platform reiterated by
him in it, and that such crisis had arisen from an
attachment to the principles in such provision and
portion of the platform enunciated, andapprehen-
sions that they would be by his administration
violated. And that he asked whether it was true
thatany right,plainly written in theConstitution,
had been denied, and said he thought not; and
that happily the human mind was so constituted
that no party could reach the audacity of refus-
ing such right. And then further said:
f< Think you, if you can, of any instance in which a
plainly written light of the Constitution lias been denied,
and that if by the force of numbers a majority should de-
prive a minority of any clearly written constitutional right,
it might, in a moral point of view, justify revolution, that
it certainly would if such right were a vital one."
And added that such is not thecase,and that—
" All the vital rights of minorities and of individuals arc
so plainly assured to them by affirmatives and negatives,
guarantees and piohibmons ui the Constitution that con-
troversies never arise concerning them."
Yet his party in Congress passed, and he signed,
a bill repealing two fugitive slave laws, the one
signed by Washington, in 1793, of which Daniel
Webster, who never lived in a slave State nor
owned a slave, in aspeech, in Buffalo, New York,
May 22, 1851, said:
" It was hardly opposed by any at the time, (referring to
that of its passage.) The great men of Now Yoi k and New
England all concurred in it, and it answered all the pur-
poses expected till about the year 1841 or 1842, when some
of the States interfered to make enactments in opposition
to it and imposing a penalty on any State officer who ex-
ercised -authority under the law, or assisted in its execu-
tion. It had become absolutely indispensable that Con-
gress should pass some law tor the execution of this pro-
vision of the Constitution, or else give up that provision
entirely. This is the question."

" I have already stated, gentlemen, what your observa-
tion ot these things must have taught you. I wiil only
recur to the subject for a moment, for the purpose of per- '
suading vou, as public men and private men.'as good men
and patriotic men. that you ought, to the extent of your
ability and influence, to s>ee to it that such laws are estab-
lished and maintained as shall keep you, and the South,
and the West, and all the country together, on the term<
of the Constitution. I say what is demanded of us is to
fulfill our constitutional duties, and do for the South what
the South has a right to demand."
The bill for the other was most strenuously
advocated by the most illustrious statesmen and
self-sacrificing and venerated patriots then in Con-
gress; Clay asserting, I think, that the necessity
for it was one of the five bleeding wounds of the
country, and Webster that it was more favorable
to the fugitive slave than that of 1793; and in one
in the Senate of the United States, that 110 slave
hadeverbeen reclaimed from Massachusetts under
such a law, and that no false claim had ever been
made for one in that State; and in another at Colby
Springs, in June, 1851, he said:
" [ do not hesitate to s: v and repeat, that if the northern
Plate* refu«<? willfully and delibeiately to carry into effect
that part of ihe Constitution which respects the restoration
ot tu^itive slaves-, tiie South would be no longer bound to
observe the compact. A haigain broken on one side is a
bargain broken on all sides."
And although he had held, when both these
weie in force, and seven of these States were in
open and defiant rebellion, and some prepaiing^
and others threatening to unite with them, four ot
which did so very soon, that every member of
Congress was oath bound to pass such a law, and
tiiat they might keep good that unanimous oath,
advised them to, and assured the country that he
nor Congress would withhold the right so con-
ferred for the reclamation of fugitive slaves, by
stating that happily the human mind was so con-
stituted that no party could reach the audacity of
denying a right plainly written in the Constitu-
tion, saying,'at the "time, after repeating the con-
stitutional provision for the rendition of fugitives
from labor, and stating that it applied to fugitive
slaves, that it was as plainly written as any clatis®
in the Constitution. , •
So the President and his party, which incl-udes
Ihe supporters of this bill, according to such his
authoritative declarations, have become guiity of
that audacity which'he thought, happily on ac
count of the constitution of the human tnind, fib
party could reach, and consequently more de-
praved than he then supposed human nature was,
and, moreover, done what Webster s&id would
release the slave States from our compact, and
consequently Government, and giveti to such
States what he then declared was certainly a moral
cause for revolution, if the right of the reclama-
tion of fugitive slaves is a vital one. Who doubts
it, when it was by the framers of the Cnn'stituiiori
regarded so much so, for the protection of twelve
States, which were then slave, against but one,
Massachusetts,which had become otherwise since
or about the time of the signing of the Declara-
tion of Independence^ that the number of States
required to ranfy the Constitution would not
have without such a provision in it. Wo sane
man acquainted with the history of the country
believes that the Union ever could have been
formed with any Constitution not containing pro-
tection for a species of property held in twelve of
the States, and which would not be subject to any
law that could be made, either by any or all of
them, if within the thirteenth. If vital then,and
it certainly was if the Union could nothave been
formed without its having become a part of the
Constitution, how much more so had it become at
the time the President thus spoke of it, when there
were twenty States and a number of Territories,
the aggregate area of which was much greater than
that of the slave States, and in all which, but for
such a law, there would be no legal protection for
such property; and when the hostility of many of
the people of all such Slates and Territories to a
right in that species of property was so great that
111 twelve of such States unconstitutional, revo-
lutionary, and nullifying enactments hail been
passed, and, in some of them, enforced tluough
sacrifice of life, to prevent the recovery of such
property in the respective States into which, as
probably all the twenty slaves had not only been
enticed but forced against their will, the right is
peculiarly vital, because, not only of the want of
power in any State in which slavery exists to pro-
tect the owners thereof extra-territorially, but of
the opportunities that slaves have and that are
afforded them of evading the laws of any of the
slave States, or that could be enacted by any of
them.
As the right to the protection and recovery of
property is highly important,no one can success-
fully controvert that this is a vital one umil he
has the right of such property, which the Pres-
ident admits. Do two laws of the importance
that Daniel Webster, Clay, and Douglas attached
to those of the kind confer no vital right? That
the President thought they did must be evident
to anyone who has read his inaugural, as it will
be that it was in consequence of his so regarding
it that he spoke of a law of that kind and the
imperative duty of Congress to pass one, and the
audacity and fearful consequences of deny ing such
a right, knowing thatalarge majority of the voters
of the free States so held and believed that the
withholding.of it, orotherrightsof which he had
spoken, permanently from any State, and much
more section of the Union, would destroy it. If
I have not shown that he so regarded it, and I
insist that I have, his statement made in his
message to the extra session of 1861, and more
than two months alter the commencement of the
war, does. That he then did so believe, and
promise such protection, and that he regarded it
and all other constitutional rights as paramount
in a rebellious war as peace, which is:
"Lest there be some uneasiness ill the limids of candid
men as to what is to lie the course of the Government to-
ward the southern States, after the lebelliou shall have
been suppressed, Ihe Executive deems it proper to say it
will be his pin pose then, as ever, to be guided by the Con-
stitution and the laws; ami that lie probably Will have no
different undersiaiiding of ttie powei.s ami duties of the
Federal Government relative to the rights oi tile States
and the people under the Constitution than that exposed
in the inaugural address. He desired to preserve the Gov-
