General BROWN,

Warrensburg, Mo:

This report came from the fact that Longwood was robbed by 12 rebels, and a party of three companies of citizens to the number of 63 men was in pursuit. These are the en that were taken for bushwhackers. This is correct to the best I can learn.

GEO. GRAHAM.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, June 6, 1864.

Major J. HACKETT,Commanding, Cassville, Mo.:

The following dispatch has just been received for Major Melton, commanding, Berryville, Ark.:

JUNE 6, 1864.

General SANBORN:

Major Pickler passed 7 miles southwest of this place, moving in direction of Keytesville by way of Butler's Creek. He is going near Newtomania. He has 250 or 300 men, well mounted and equipped. He left Texas five weeks ago. I have all confidence in the correctness of this report as it came through such hands. My informant had a personal interview with one of his men. I think he will come across the Wire road to-night. His destination is North Missouri.

J. A. MELTON,

Major, Commanding.

You will immediately move out with sufficient force from your command, and if possible attack and destroy Pickler's command when he attempts to cross the Wire road, if he has not already crossed.

By order of Brigadier-General Sanborn:

W. D. HUBBARD,

Lieutenant, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., June 6, 1864.

Colonel CAMERON,Cassville, Mo.:

Assume command of the post as you contemplated. Colonel Phelps thinks that Lieutenant Bell should remain with Major Hackett. Detail some other officer for your adjutant if possible, and inform me,, and I will revoke the order detailing Bell; or if Major Hackett can select some other proper officer for his adjutant that will do. Give me your opinion as to the propriety of occupying Early's Ferry, on the White River, instead of Berryville, for the next few weeks.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
