Plank road: Company C, Twentieth Battalion-one 6-pounder, 56 runds; three 24-pounder siege guns, 52 rounds each. One ladle for 24-pounder and two lanterns needed.

In the work overlooking the canal are two field guns manned by a detachment from the navy battalion.

On the south side of James River the intermediate line is incomplete from Broad Rock road to the river on the right. The troops in this quarter are, therefore, posted in the forts of the interior line as follows:

Battery 14: Detachment Green's company Louisiana Light Artillery (just exchanged)-1 officer and 20 men, one 8-inch shell gun, 40 rounds; one 32-pounder, 40 rounds; three 6-pounders, 50 rounds each. This work is entirely commanded by the ground a few hundred yards in front.

Battery 15: Detachment of Company D, Eighteenth Virginia Battalion, and Green's Louisiana company-five 32-pounders, 30 rounds each; two 6-pounders, 50 rounds each; one 12-pounder howitzer, 26 rounds.

Battery 17: Detachment (1 officer and 17 men) Green's (Louisiana) company-one 8-inch shell gun, 40 rounds; one 32-pounder, 40 rounds.

The following guns are disposed on the intermediate line, each with a detachment of 5 men from the Eighteenth Virginia Battalion and Green's (Louisiana) company:

Broad Rock road: One 12-pounder, 40 rounds; two 6-pounders, 50 rounds each; one 12-pounder howitzer, 40 rounds.

Between Broad Rock road and Petersburg railroad: One 6-pounder, 50 rounds; one 12-pounder howitzer, 39 rounds.

Petersburg railroad: One 8-inch shell gun, 100 rounds; one 10-pounder Parrott, 45 rounds.

Petersburg turnpike: One 6-pounder, 50 rounds; one 12-pounder howitzer, 39 rounds.

Second battery from the river: One 6-pounder, 50 rounds.

Battalion commanders report that they have no officers whom it would be expedient to drop for incompetence or drunkenness. There are no schools of tactics.

Drill: As infantry, imperfect; in Companies A and C, Nineteenth Virginia Battalion, bad; as heavy artillery, good, except detachment Company A, Twentieth Battalion, on Mill road, Most of the commanding officers report that owing to the heavy details for guard duty in Richmond during the last ten months they have been unable to drill their commands. The morale of these troops has been doubtless much impaired by this service. Three drills a day have recently been ordered by General Pemberton, and the details for city duty are suspended. With the exception of two or three companies, which have seen service, the men have had no artillery practice. The non-commissioned officers are reported as generally ignorant of the theory of firing.

No officers absent without leave; 9 men who received furloughs remain absent without leave. Clothing very good; 11 men entirely without shoes, the remainder generally with excellent shoes; 72 men without a blanket. These battalions have no transportation.

Arms: One thousand one hundred and twenty-five smooth-bore, caliber .69; 28 rifled, caliber, .69; 215 rifled, caliber, .58; 260 rifled, caliber, 54. In no case were the arms in as good order as is required
