*Guns not given on return.

#Note on return says: "The First and Third Divisions, Cavalry Corps, served with this army during the month of July, but it being understood that the records of those commands have been captured or lost, rendering it impracticable to obtain the returns for some time to come, and as they left this army early in August, it has been thought advisable to drop them from this return in order that this return might not be longer delayed." For abstract of the cavalry divisions omitted from the return of the Army of the Potomac, see following table:
