Two regiments were organized in Kansas from negroes, I understood, obtained from Arkansas, though not under my superintendence.

It may be proper to state that, while each State named above is credited with certain regiments, the men did not always come from there, and the companies of a regiment were sometimes made up in two different States. A regiment of 1,000 men was recruited at Evansville, Ind., from Kentucky negroes, and the latter State received credit for them on her quota of the draft. This regiment is not enumerated in the tabular statement.
