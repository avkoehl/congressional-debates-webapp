completed. They had got along up to the color company. I stood directly in rear of the color company, within 5 feet of the line, at the time. Suddenly we heard a clattering among the stones; you could see nothing; I supposed it was the major's horse floundering amount the stones; but it turned out to be a body of the enemy's cavalry that made a dash at us and delivered a fire from carbines, as I supposed. I immediately ordered my regiment to return the fire; I repeated it about three times. I found they did not return it, and I ordered the One hundred and eleventh Regiment to cease firing. We held our position; I looked about as well as I could; we could see nothing; I found one dead man lying pretty near me; I could not tell who it was. I got some matches from one of the soldiers, and rubbed and tried to make out the man's face, but it was all covered with blood. I went on until I found 4 men killed and 1 very seriously wounded; I sent him to the hospital tent in our camp, but he died before morning. That made 5 killed. I do not know how many were wounded, 9 or 10, mostly slightly wounded. One man was wounded in the breast, and another had a little finger shot off-some little things of that kind.

By the COURT:

Question. Those were your own men?

Answer. Yes, sir. I could not tell how many of the rebels were killed, or whether any of them were, until the next day. When they came into our camp they told us we had killed 20 of them and wounded a number more. That is all I know about it. I did not see them. We remained there in line until daylight, as had been ordered.
