General BARTLETT:

I have sent orders for you to move at 5.30 a.m., so as t keep closed upon General Parke's corps. I think that will be as early as the rear of his column will be out of your way; but I wish you would call up and see him, as he is near you, and ascertain if that is not so. I find many things to look after or I would go over myself and arrange it more definitely. Please let me know by telegraph if my arrangements are right according to Parke's.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
