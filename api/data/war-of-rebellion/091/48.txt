BALTIMORE, MD., September 7, 1864.

General JOHN D. STEVENSON:

Your dispatch received. We are ready and anxious to resume repairs of road, and can reopen it to Martinsburg, we think, in four days and nights of uninterrupted work. We have had more than there years' experience, however, of every character, in this business,

and do not feel satisfied that the proportion is adequate, unless you can assure us that our troops thoroughly hold the line in front of our road from Berryville or Charlestown to Bunker Hill and west of it covering North Mountain and Back Creek. If this is the case, and you can generally assure us of the reasonable safety of our men, and trains, we will venture the work at once. Please advice us.
