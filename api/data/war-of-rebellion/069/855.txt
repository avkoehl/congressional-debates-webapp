MAY 30, 1864 - 10 p. m.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: We had artillery firing and skirmishing to-day, inflicting more damage than we received, but not much on either side. Enemy shelled heavily this evening; little harm done; it was followed by sharp skirmishing on my right. I am removing now to the new line marked out by General Smith. General Kershaw sent me word this evening that his division was ordered away. I have sought for troops to connect with my right, but do not find any.

Respectfully,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

P. S. - My headquarters are on the main road, about one-half mile from those I have lately had.

By order of General Lee:

C. S. VENABLE,

Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,May 30, 1864 - 11.30 p. m.

Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Commanding, &amp; c.:

GENERAL: Your note of 10 p. m. has been received and referred to Major-General Anderson, with regard to the desired connection on your right. General Anderson moved no doubt on a call from General Early to support him in a movement against enemy on this side of Totopotomoy Creek, in front of Second Corps, and will return very probably to his original position before morning. In case he does not return before daylight, it would be well to protect your right with skirmishers, and notify General Hill, who has very little in front of his left, and can aid you.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. S. VENABLE,

Aide-de-Camp.
