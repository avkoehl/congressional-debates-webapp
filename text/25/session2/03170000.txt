COMMISSION OP CLAIMS
The House   then  asain  went into romnntke,
Mr  CORW1N m the Chan, on  the "bill to esta
blish a board of Comtiii sioner¡> to expmme and
decide certain claims against the United Siaios "
The question was on the amendment oí Mi
WHITTLESEY of Ohio (who had repoited the
bill) to appoint the Conmissioneis diumggnoil Le
havioi, with a limitation to Ihc age oí ¿íyeai'-,
and the question pe id n¿ wa-, on the kllowmg
amendment to Mr WHITTLESEY'S, moved by
Mr   HFNRY
"And to serve foi three years, one lor six }f Us,
and one for nine years , pnd at the teiimnation of
these respective pe'ioiN and c\er¡ nine \eais
thereaftet, a new appointment of one commi- n ner
shall be made as aforesaid, to serve toi mne ycais "
On moving this . a endmen' ye teiday,
Mi HENRY said he was sat sued with the ge-
neral principles of the bill now be ore the commit-
tee, on the ground c f eco íomy on the pait t' the
Government, as «ell as an act o ""justice to pmate
claimants He believed theie must be few ire n-
bers in this House but are now convinced that it
was impossible for Congress to act upon the private
claims presented within a leasonable time, and re-
quiring its attention. He knew there were claims
standing as far back as twenty years, and one of an
older date than that, from the d strict he had tne
honor to represent, had passed this session. But
wbiEt he approbated the geneial features of the
bill, he must beg leave to submit the amendment
which he sent to the Chair as a substitute for the
amendment offered by the gentleman from Ohio,
to be inserted at the end of the sixth in t. m the fit -t
section.
Mr WHITTLESEY replieri.and spot e in fa\o-
©f an independent board
Mr. ADAMS propounded questions to the g"n-
tleman from Pennsylvania as to the constitutional-
ity of limiting such appointments
Ml HENRY, m answei to Mr Adams, said he
did not apprehená there was the const t itional dil-
ficulty suggested by the honorable gent it nn from
Massachusetts, that this contemplated board of
commissioners would not be a coutt, such as w as
recognised m the clause of the Constitution ad\cit-
ed to by that honorable gentleman, that this, he
thought, could not be called a court, although, it is
true, it would be clothed with judicial powers, but
so were all auditors who adjud cate and settle ac-
counts He could, hovvevei, view this board in
no other light than that of auditors oi firaii ssion
trs to pass upon accounts or claims, and cou'd n< t
view it as p judicial tnounal within me meanint of
the Constitution
As to the objections, Mi H said, maele by Ins
fuend from Ohi*  aga nst his substitute, and m la-
vor oí an independent peimaient board, he was
constrained to say he was opposed to 1 fe tenute of
oflice, or offic" dining good behavtoi llnspiin-
ciple of independí n"c olton made officers teo inde-
pendent, and they become careless and iintK ntive

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Monday, April 9, 1838
As soon as the journal was read,
Mr HAMER rose, and stated that he wished to
avail himseif of the earliest opportunity of making
_______PRICE $1 PER SESSION.
an explanation in. reference to the resolution laid
en the table by him on Saturday
The resolution was as  follows
"Considering that the business, commerce, circu-
lation, and exchanges of the country are in a de-
ranged and embarrassed condition and
"Cons e'ermg also, ihat a part of the banks of
the United States have expressed a desire to resume
specie pa) ments ->t an early period
"Jltsnlved by the Senate and Home of Representa-
tives of th° Unted States of Amenea m Congiess
assembled, That if the banks, or a portion of them,
do thus resume, it will be the duty of the General
Government, within the limits ot its constitutional
authority, to aid such banks, as the present Admi-
nistiation design to do, in regaining public confi-
dence, and to sustain them in their laudable efforts
to fulfil then obligations, to relieve the wants of the
com nuntty, and to íestore to the publica ound
circula ing ne' um "
It seen ed 'hat the introduction of the resolu-
1 it on i oduifd sime excitement in the House,
and a numbei oigt ntlemen came to him to inquire
the meaning, the true construction, 6x and among
the rest a friend, in v hose judgment he had great
confidence, suggp^ted to him, that if the resolution
went out in the newspapers, without any explana-
tory remarks from Mr. H it might be subject to
thewfe'cnce that he thought the present Admmis-
ti ition really tntei tamed hostility towards these
1 inks, xvlio weie about to resume specie payments,
an 1 that his obiect, in offering the resolution, xvas
t > compel t.i m 11 change their course. Mr H
replied, at o ice, that he entertained no such sen i
ment, ¡ n I hat, when he got an oppoitunity to ex-
pi n, he would rhow what his meaning was.
1 lowe\ei, to avoid any such construction oi con-
clusion, ind knowing that the resolution did not go
on the journals, no' being in the possession of the
Hon e, and entirely his own, he considered he had
a rig it to modify it, either before or after its being
punted, and he accordingly mserterted the words,
" as the prcs'nt Mminishalwn design to do," as ex-
pi in itory of what was his own opinion He did
no* simóse a i that time, that he «as exercising
a light that d d not Lelong to him, yet, if he had
done w roil"' in making th"t modificat on, he cer-
ttinly a ' rdpaidonol the House The resolution,
« i he ut those siords, was the resolution he intend-
ed to offer, ant1 he should, in subm ttmg it, strike
opt th?t n odification, as it xvas merely inserted
tempotanlv in self-defence, and in explanation of
hi-- i ->otiv«s Mr H then asked the consent of
the House to «oiumit it at this time in that form.
Mi  PL IRUCEN objected.
Mi WHITTLESEY of Ohio hoped his col-
leagi p would not press it at this time as he would
h ve a t opportunity to do so before the day xvas
over
Mr WISE hoped the gentl*m?n would move a
susper sion Ot tne rulta M' W had vot3d to
punt the levolulion, the igh he wouldnot nave sup-
poited it wi'ii lie nodification, but had no doubt
the ,ei tleman had a perfect right to make it.
M r   II *lMEPi mo íed a suspension of the rules
Mr PENN1 BACKER asked for the yeas and
nays,  xhich vure o tiered
Oa motion of Mr McKENNAN, a call of the
ITou e ws assented to, and proceeded in until one
bund-el and fifty six members had answered to

xtiether the -xords "as. the present Administration
desigr to do" had been stricken from the resolution
by the mover?
The CHAIR replied that the gentleman had so
modified it, but it was not yet before the House
Mr PICKENS was understood to remark that
he could perceive no practicable benefit whatever
to result from the adoption of this resolution
