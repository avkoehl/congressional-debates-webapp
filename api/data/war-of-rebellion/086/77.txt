The tubes of many of the Austrian rifles issued to the new one-year Missouri regiments are defective. Examine into it and send new tubes if the fault is there only. If not, it may be necessary to issue other arms.

All officers in the field sending official dispatches or communications of any kind will embody in each not only the date but the hour of sending, and will designate clearly the place of writing, if upon the march or in camp, by giving the distance and direction from some known point. When sent by special messenger the hour of departure and name of messenger will be written upon the envelope.

J. F. BENNETT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., October 18, 1864.

Colonel J. V. DU BOIS,

Jefferson City:

I send Colonel Holmes with 250 Sixty-first Illinois Veterans to Allen, with instructions to take command at Mexico of the 800 men of the Eighteenth Colored and Fortieth Missouri Infantry, which I sent there Saturday. I will require a telegram from you to General Douglass to turn over the command of them to Colonel Holmes, they having reported to General Douglass by my orders. His instructions to pursue the enemy are as directed in your dispatch. This exhausts the disposable volunteer force of the city. If you are likely to need any more, I shall have to call in some of Pike's or Miller's militia to relieve the volunteers. It will take two for one of the militia to do the work on account of their straggling propensities.
