CITY POINT, VA., September 24, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

During your absence, and when an attack was anticipated, at the suggestion of General Ord, I directed General Meade to hold himself responsible for all of the line south of the Appomattox, and that all troops occupying such line obey his orders. It was under these circumstances that General Meade directed General Birney to send prisoners and deserters to his provost-marshal. The Second Corps relieving the Tenth to-night will make it unnecessary either to repeal or withdraw the order. All prisoners and deserters taken by either army, however, should be sent to the provost-marshal-general at City Point as soon as questioned. I suppose they have been so disposed of heretofore.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE A. KENSEL,

Acting Chief of Staff:

COLONEL; The signal officer at tower on James River reports "situation unchanged from yesterday." The signal officer at Spring Hill reports that nothing new has occurred to-day along the enemy's lines. Their working parties have been employed in strengthening their works during the day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Nothing of interest on my line. The large 7-inch Brooke gun has been moved from its position. The salute elicited little or no response. The contraband sent up on yesterday reported the moving of artillery (heavy guns) on trucks to South Side Railroad.

Major-General.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Tenth Army Corps:

Please inform me upon what authority prisoners of war and desirers from the enemy sent of you are forwarded other than to the provost marshal at these headquarters, as I understand they are. In future will you see that all such persons are forwarded at once to these headquarters?

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
