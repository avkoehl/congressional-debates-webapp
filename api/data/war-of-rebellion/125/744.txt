September 25, 1864-3 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

The President some time ago authorized a regiment of prisoners of war at Rock Island to be enlisted into our service. He has written you a letter of explanation.* It was done without my knowledge and he desires his arrangement to be carried into effect. The question now arises how shall they be organized, officered, and assigned to duty? Shall they be formed into one regiment by companies as other troops, or assigned in companies or squads to other organizations? Please favor me with your views on the subject. The President's letter is forwarded you by mail.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, VA., September 25, 1864-6.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington:

Your dispatch in relation to the organization of troops from prisoners of war is just received. I would advise that they be placed all in one regiment, and be put on duty either with Pope, or sent to New Mexico.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

SOUTH BEND, IND., September 26, 1864.

(Received 3 p. m.)

His Excellency PRESIDENT LINCOLN:

Fry's decision that drafted men skedaddling must be made up from Unionists who don"t run is terrible. How can Government justly hold skedaddlers as deserters and demand substitutes besides? I beg you to revoke it.
