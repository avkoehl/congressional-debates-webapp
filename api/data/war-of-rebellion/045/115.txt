Honorable E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War:

Prisoners who came in last night state that Lee's army has been re-enforced from South Carolina, Georgia, and North Carolina; that it now consists of three corps, under Longstreet, Ewell, and A. P. Hill. The two latter are reported south of the Rappahannock, and would not attack us unless Stuart and Longstreet were attacked.

June 15, 1863-6 a. m. (Received 7. 15 a. m.)

SECRETARY OF WAR:

It would be well to place several batteries and good force at he mouth of the Monocacy, as Stuart will attempt to cross through the culvert under the canal. By delaying him, I shall be able to overtake him, in case my force is not needed here. Harper's Ferry, the mouth of the Monocacy, and the river between these two, should be well guarded. Longstreet will probably strike for Williamsport and Hagerstown, in case he is repulsed at Harper's Ferry. Stuart will strike for Poolesville if he cannot cross at the mouth of the Monocacy. Keep the canal full of Water.

A. PLEASONTON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
