HEADQUARTERS FORREST'S CAVALRY,Tupelo, May 17, 1864.

Major WILLIAM ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Since writing to the major-general commanding this morning. I have had an interview with several persons from Memphis and from that neighborhood, and all agree in the opinion that preparations are being made by the enemy for a move or raid into Mississippi. Unless there are indications of a move on Yazoo City and from thence on Central road by the enemy, I would suggest to the major-general commanding that the two regiments at Grenada, under command of Colonel Duckworth, be ordered up to Oxford, for the purpose of meeting any moe from Memphis in that direction. Have ordered Captain Henderson, commanding scouts, to telegraph you promptly all information of importance.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General ADAMS,

Canton:

Two howitzers leave Demopolis for you to-morrow. Send horses to terminus of road for them. Will send two rifle pieces as soon as they can be got. Would like you to have two additional pieces, but have only twenty horses for them. Can you furnish either horses or mules?

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Cipher dispatch of 17th received. * Do not deem it prudent to make movement suggested now, as force of 4,500 cavalry and 10,000 infantry, white and negroes, were reviewed in Memphis on the 14th, and a raid is expected. Lines are closed at Memphis. Have taken Trans-MISSISSIPPI arms for unarmed with Forrest.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.
