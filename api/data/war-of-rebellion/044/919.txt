Mr. W. P. SMITH,

Supt. Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, Baltimore, Md.:

SIR: It is the order of the Secretary of War that a regiment of infantry and one battery of artillery be sent from this place at once to New York. There will be about 500 men. six pieces of artillery, caissons, and 100 horses.

It is the wish of General Meade that the transportation for this body of troops be here at the earliest practicable moment, and that they be sent direct to New York City. Inform me as soon as possible what you can do in this matter and how soon the cars can be here.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: This city is in danger for want of a sufficient force and an energetic head for the maintenance of order and the execution of the law. Can you not give us General Butler and an ample force? I know five regiments are on the way, but we want an iron will to direct them. You cannot complete the draft without such a will and 10, 000 men behind it.

THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:

SIR: We must have more military force, and a military head for New York. Lest me recommend the appointment of General Butler to this department, and the giving him an ample force to suppress the riot here and to suppress it everywhere. Any delay is hazardous.

Honorable SALMON P. CHASE,

SIR: I fear the Government does not appreciate the magnitude of the danger from resistance to the law in this city. We want such an iron will as General Butler`s, and at least 10, 000 effective men. Pray see the President and Secretary of War, to whom I have just telegraphed. A day`s delay is hazardous.
