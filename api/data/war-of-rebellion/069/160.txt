HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 24, 1864-11 p.m.

Major DUANE:

I have not any report from Crawford or Russell that their pickets connect, but I learn from what I believe reliable sources that they do. Major Roebling says Quarles' Ford is about half a mile above where Crittenden is, and that the ford was reported by a signal officer who crossed it as good for artillery. You can show this to General Meade if he is up yet.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you move your corps at 4 a.m. to-morrow, and take position enveloping the enemy's line. You will have Crittenden's division, of the Ninth Corps, now in position, for your left flank. General Wright is directed to move after you, and take post on your right and rear to protect that flank.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

P. S.-Major Duane is ordered to throw a bridge across the river as close to your left flank as practicable, and make good approaches to it.
