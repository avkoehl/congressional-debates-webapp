THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 23,
should be appropriated annually for its pay-
ment?
I believe tbat the bestinterest of the country
demands a large reduction of the amount of
taxation. It is now our duty to do again what
was done with such beneficial results in the
Thirty-Ninth Congress, to reduce taxation; and
while perhaps there will be little or no differ-
ence of opinion upon this proposition, I im-
agine that there will be a great deal more diffi-
culty in arriving at an agreement upon the
question what taxes shall be removed or re-
duced. Upon this question I state certain
propositions which seem to me incontrovert-
ible :
First. If there be any large interest in the
country, the prosperity of which would be the
prosperity of the country itself, which has been
burdened more heavily than any other, that
interest should be relieved.
Second. Taxes which hinder and lessen pro-
duction should, as far as possible, be removed.
I come from a State whose great interest is
agriculture, and it seems to me susceptible of
the clearest demonstration that the agricultural
interest has been moro heavily burdened by
the present tariff than any other, and that it
has derived from it the smallest compensation.
If this is so we have before us the fact that the
leading producing interest of the country, the
annual value of whose product is about $3,300, -
000,000, is subject to burdens greatly dispropor-
tionate to those borne by other interests. Let us
examine this question. It is an indisputable fact,
which I have myself verified by my own observa-
tion, that the price of grain in Chicago to-day
is fixed by the price in Liverpool yesterday.
Buj ers look not to the cost of production here,
but to the latest dispatch by the Atlantic cable,
when their bids are made; and the price of
wheat, the great agricultural staple, is con-
trolled by tlie price in European markets.
The price of the surplus grain of the country
regulates the price of the whole crop. It is
impossible that there should be a higher price
paid here than is paid abroad if wo must
sell a portion of our crop in the foreign mar-
ket. Of course no amount of grain will ever go
abroad at all while the price is better or as
good at homo.
If, therefore, we have a surplus which we
must sell abroad, no matter how small that
surplus is, the price in the foreign market
regulates the price at home. Every man who
will look at the prices paid for grain in Chi-
cago, for instance, for the past year will see
that the price in Chicago on any given day has
been regulated by the price in Liverpool or
London of the day before, unless in rare in-
stances when capital has succeeded for a few
days or hours in setting aside the laws of
trade by creating a corner upon any given
article. We have been told many times in this
debate that this state of things will be reme-
died by the tariff, which will make a home
market for our produce. 1 propose to discuss
that question presently, but the point which I
wish just here to present plainly is this : that
our wheat grown in this country is grown
under the condition of absolute free trade so
far as that article is consumed; that is, the
farmer get3 no more for his wheat than he
would if there was absolutely no tariff. We
hear much said about competing with the
pauper labor of Europe. I insist that while
the mechanic, the artisan, the miner, may be
protected by the tariff, the farmer does abso-
lutely grow his grain in competition with the
pauper labor of Europe. In dealing fairly with
this question we must consider this fact and
give it the prominence it deserves.
And while the farmer raises his grain thus
wholly without protection, and in competition
with the cheap labor of Europe, how is the
cost of raising grain affected by the tariff; or,
in other words, if the tariff does not help him,
does it harm him? Does it make it more ex-
pensive and difficult for him to meet the com-
petition which he must meet in the markets of
the world? Let us examine this question a
moment. In the first place the price of every
implement of his industry is increased, first,
by the tariff; second, by the depreciation of
the currency. All the articles which he does
not himself produce, but which are consumed
in his family, are enhanced in price by the
same two causes; or, in other words, he sells
without protection, and upon a gold basis he
buys protected articles for a price fixed upon
a currency basis. The cost of that which he
buys is enhanced by the depreciation of the
currency. The price of the grain which he
has to sell is fixed by a foreign market, where
gold is the standard of value. That this is so
can be demonstrated by a comparison of the
prices paid for grain in gold before the war
and the prices now paid.
It is true that during the war, when vast
numbers of agriculturists ceased to be pro-
ducers and became consumers, a market was
made for breadstuffs for the supply of the
Army, which enhanced the price; but that
demand was temporary and abnormal, and is
entitled to no consideration in determining the
question.
In determining this point one fact is worth
a thousand theories. I give a table, carefully
prepared, of the prices in Chicago before the
inflation of the currency and before the adop-
tion of the present tariff and the present prices:
Wheat:
March 1 to 31, 1839, standard spring, 97@105 gold.
March 1 to 31, J860, standard spring, 98fel04 gold.
March 1 to 11, 1870, standard spring, 77i(«'792 cur'cy.
Corn:
March 1 to 31, 1859, No. 1 66;?75 gold.
March 1 to 11,1870, No. 1 70&71 currency.
Oats:
March 1 to 31,1859, No. 1 50(i?r>5 gold.
March 1 to 31, I860, N o. 1 30(433 gold.
March 1 to It, 1870, No. 1 35(s:38ciuTeHcy.
The farmers of Illinois are receiving now in
currency less than they received in gold before
the present tariff was imposed. The cost of the
transportation of their products to market is
greatly enhanced by the tariff. The enhanced
cost of railroads, of locomotives, of ears, of
maintenance of railroads, is paid by a heavier
tax upon transportation, and so while the cost
of operating railroads in this country in 1808
equaled $1 66 per mile run by the trains, in
England the cost was 62 cents per mile. This
enhanced cost of transportation is in addition
to the other burdens imposed upon agriculture
in this country. But we are told that the farmer
is to be benefited by the home market for his
products which is to be caused by the building
up of homo manufactories. I ask when; how
long at present rates will it require for the ben-
efits to become appreciable? When I hear this
argument stated and reiterated in facc of the
fact that the price of grain is lower to-day in
currency than it was in gold before the time
and at the time the present tariff was imposed,
I am always reminded of the poetic line—
" Man never is, but always to bo blest."
But let us look at the question carefully. If
the price of grain m this country is regulated
by the price of the surplus abroad, as is most
evident, then the price will not be generally
enhaneed until there is no surplus to send
abroad, or, in other words, until ail the grain
grown in the country is consumed by the in-
habitants of the country. It is estimated by
the Special Commissioner of the Revenue that
the State of Illinois alone, if cultivated to the
degree of the lands in England and Belgium,
would raise sufficient food for all the present
inhabitants of tho United States. One thing
is manifest: if a sufficient number of manu-
factories of every kind are established to con-
sume the products of the agriculturist and leave
no surplus, a foreign market for manufactured
articles must be found. If -we had as many
skilled workmen employed in> manufacturing
as the farmers of the country could supply with
food and leave no surplus, w should manu-
facture for the world, Of course it is true
that such a manufacturing interest cannot be
built up without a foreign market for its manu-
factures; the home demand alone will never
cause so great an increase of manufactories
among us. And it is equally true and patent
to all observers that we cannot have such a
foreign market while it costs from 50 to 80 per
cent, more to manufacture in this country than
it costs to manufacture the same article abroad.
The tariff which enhances the price of all
material and of every element of the cost of
our manufactures makes it impossible that we
should manufacture articles for a foreign mar-
ket except in'very particular instances and in
very limited quantities, where the cost of man-
ufacturing the article is not the measure of its
value. The time will never come when we will
have manufacturers enough to consume all the
surplus food of the country, and yet who will
manufacture no more goods than can be profit-
ably consumed in the country. The scheme
of providing a home market for all the food
that can be profitably raised in this immense
agricultural country, the greatest extent of
fertile land in the world, as yet new and un-
moved, is a delusion and a snare, as the price
of grain to-day under the present tariff demon-
strates.
To sustain the theory insisted upon that the
present arrangement of the tariff will furnish
a sufficient home market for the agricultural
products of the country it ought to appear that
under its operation our exports of grain are>
decreasing and our exports of manufactured
articles are increasing. Unfortunately for the
theory the facts are precisely the reverse.
The amount of grain exported is increasing,
and the value of exports of manufactured arti-
cles is decreasing, as the following statistics
show :
