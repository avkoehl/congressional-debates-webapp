General JOSEPH HOOKER, Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

I arrived here with my command at 5 p. m. I have heard nothing reliable relative to the position of the enemy. A pontoon bridge should be thrown across the river, near Edwards Ferry, if we are to remain here any length of time. The material for a bridge, with a party to build it, should be sent at once. I have communicated with Reynolds and Howard. Shall leave an orderly at the telegraph office from which this is sent.

Major-General.
