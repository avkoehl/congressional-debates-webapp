THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 4,
Mr. STEWART. I ask unanimous con-
sent after the morning business to have the
vote taken. I have nothing to say about it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is there objec-
tion?
Mr. ROBERTSON. I object.
The VICE PRESIDENT presented a memo-
rial and resolution of the Legislature of Iowa,
in relation to the Niagara Falls ship-canal;
which was referred to the Committee ou Com-
merce, and ordered to be printed.
Mr. RAMSEY. I present a petition of a
large number of highly respectable and benev-
olent people of Minnesota, who set forth that a
desolating famine exists in many districts of
the Persian nation; that thousands have already
died, and thousands more must soon perish if
succor is not speedily rendered ; that the Per-
sian Government cannot or will not afford the
necessary assisiance, and that the necessity
for foreign relief is most urgent. They say
''the magnitude of the calamity, the great dis-
tance between them and us, and the difficul-
ties of communication, are such as to prevent
private benevolence, unaided, from effectually
reaching them." They therefore respectfully
petition Congress to adopt such measures as
they may think best to bring the subject be-
fore the public mind, and provide ways and
means for collecting and disbursing the chari-
ties of the benevolent who may wish to remem-
ber them in their adversity. I do not know
to what committee this would properly belong,
?robably the Committee on Foreign Relations,
move its reference to that committee.

REPORTS OF COMMITTEES.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Pensions to report adversely upon
the bill (H. R. No. 1334) for the relief of J.
W. Quinn. This excellent old gentleman is
like all others who have served in the civil and
military service and has got old. He does not
stand within the principle of any law granting
pensions, and we are therefore obliged to report
against the bill.
The bill was postponed indefinitely.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I am directed by the Com-
mittee ou Pensions to report adversely upon
the petition of Sarah M. Dove, praying for an
increase of pension. That falls within the
principle we have decided over and over again.
Tho committee was discharged from the
further consideration of the petition.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The same committee ask
to be discharged from the consideration of the
resolutions of the Legislature of Iowa recom-
mending an increase of the pension of Charlotte
D. Crocker. This ease falls within the ordin-
ary principle of merely increasing a pension,
which we cannot do.
The committee was discharged from the
farther consideration of the resolutions.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The same committee also
report adversely upon the petition of soldiers
and sailors of the war of the rebellion, pray-
ing that the name of Patrick Brennan be placed
upon the invalid pension-roll. It appears from
the statement of the petition that this soldier
received his injury after he had left the mili-
tary service, and was engaged in private em-
ployment.
The committee was discharged from the
further consideration of the petition.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The committee also re-
port adversely upon the petition of Margaret
Jeron, asking an ears of pension on the ground
already stated frequently.
The committee was discharged from the
farther considcaiion of the petition.
Mr. TIPTON, from the Committee on Pen-
sions, to whom was referred the bill (H. R.
No. 8G8) granting a pension to Rosanna Quinn,
reported adversely thereon, and moved its
indefinite postponement; which was agreed to.
Mr. RAMSEY, from the Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads, to whom was referred
the bill (S. No. 842) to authorize the construc-
tion of a bridge across the Mississippi river,
at or near the city of Red Wing, m the State
of Minnesota, and to establish it as a post road,
reported it without amendment.
Mr. MORTON, from the Committee on
Privileges arid Klections, to whom was referred
the bill (H. R. No. 1048) supplemental to and
amendatory of an act entitled ''An act to pre-
scribe the mode of obtaining evidence in caÂ«es
of contested elections," appioved Februaiy
19, 1851. reported it with an amendment.
Mr. PRATT. The Committee on Pensions,
to whom was referred the petition of Rose
Pitchcy, of Cumberland county, Kentucky,
have had the same under consideration. The
petition is indorsed as a prayer that she be
allowed a pension, but upon examination of
the petition 1 discover that it is a prayer for a
bpunty out cf which she has been swindled by
a claim agent. The committee therefore direct
mc to repoit the petition back, asking'to be
discharged from its further consideiation, and
that it be referred to the Committee on Mili-
tary Affairs.
The report was agreed to.
_ Mr. PRATT, from the Committee on Pen-
sions, to whom was referred a petition of sol-
diers of Milwaukee, Wisconsin, praying for
an increase of the pensions of totally dis-
abled boldiers, submitted an adverse report.;
which was ordered to be printed, and the com-
mittee was discharged from the further con-
sideration of the petition.
He also, from the same committee, to whom
was referred the petition of Elizabeth S.
Lathrop, widow of Captain Solon H. Lathrop,
