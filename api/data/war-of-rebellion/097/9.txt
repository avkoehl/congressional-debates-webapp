Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The following just received:
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,

March 16, 1865.

Major-General PARKE:

Have seen General Hartranft and sent to General Willcox. General Hartranft thinks the disturbance in the enemy's lines is about over. He does not think they mean anything aggressive. They were under arms for some purpose and seemed to be awaiting something. No tents struck. No more men apparent than yesterday.

Lieutenant Wardwell, just returned from Avery's house, agrees with this.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,March 16, 1865. (Received 10.20 a. m.)

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Hdqrs. Army of the Potomac:

Nothing worthy of mention has occurred on my lines.

H. E. DAVIES, JR.,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE JAMES,March 16, 1865-8.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

The Blackwater, a branch of the Chowan, I am informed cannot be forded except near the Army of the Potomac. Cavalry would have to have a ferry or pontoons. The ferry is destroyed; hence a dash can't be made now. Would it not be well to telegraph to Yorktown that a boat may be sent up, notifying Summer?

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 16, 1865.

Major-General ORD:

You can send a dispatch to Fort Monroe and Norfolk directing that when Summer reaches there he will come on up the river without debarking his troops. I think he will not leave White House earlier than to-morrow noon. Last night Sheridan had not reached there.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
