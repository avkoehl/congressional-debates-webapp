HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,November 30, 1864.

Colonel H. A. BARNUM,

Commanding Third Brigade:

COLONEL: The general commanding division directs that the detachment from your brigade sent to the bridge, destroy it as nearly as possible in the morning, and then rejoin their brigade without further delay. To enable them to do this it will be necessary for you to send them axes to-night. The bridge should be destroyed early in the morning. This change of order results from the coming in of the Sixtieth New York Veteran Volunteers before the arrival of Colonel Jones' brigade, which is now here. The general directs that you send, in addition to the 100 men already sent, one regiment, to reach the bridge before daylight, to assist in destroying it, and then return with the detachment and overtake the main body, which will probably be on the march.

I am, Colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. FORBES,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

I am, major, respectfully, your obedient servant,
