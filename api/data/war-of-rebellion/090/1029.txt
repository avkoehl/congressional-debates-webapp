the enemy in front and Kershaw held the approaches to Brown's Gap (see plate ---*). Our cavalry made a successful attack and everything was in position for a surprise, when the artillery opened prematurely and warned the enemy and they fled, only skirmishing some with our cavalry, which drove them toward Mount Meridian. Pegram crossed the river and joined Gordon and Ramseur in driving the enemy across North River, when we shelled them very successfully as they fled from the hill opposite Port Republic (see plate ---*). We encamped between the rivers, except Kershaw, who remained at Brown's Gap. Some misunderstanding of orders delayed the march on the morning of the 28th, when we started for Waynesborough, the enemy having gone there via Staunton on the 27th. Our trains crossed at Patterson's Ford and went up South River, Ramseur in front of them, followed by Wharton. Pegram marched by the Waynesborough road from Mount Meridian, turning by the Dogtown road five miles from Waynesborough. Kershaw, followed by Gordon, marched by New Hope and Hermitage, striking the enemy's cavalry at the latter place and driving it on toward Dogtown. Pegram met the enemy about four miles from Dogtown and drove them there; then formed a line after dark and drove them to the Staunton road and toward Fishersville, our cavalry having previously gone by a by-road to near the tunnel and driven the enemy across South River and through Waynesborough (see plate ---*). All encamped after dark in thee vicinity of Waynesborough. On the 29th the army rested, the engineer troops and pioneers being engaged in rebuilding the railroad bridges across South River and Christian's Creek, which the enemy had destroyed. The enemy's cavalry retreated via Staunton, Spring Hill, and Mossy Creek to Bridgewater, while those along the Valley road fell back to North River, burning barns, mills, &amp; c., as they went. Our cavalry went to Middle River. All quiet on the 30th.

October 1, the army moved to the vicinity of Mount Sidney, Gordon, Kershaw, and Pegram marching by the road to the Willow Pump, and then down the Valley road three miles beyond Mount Sidney. Ramseur and Wharton went by the Mount Meridian road and across by Piedmont to within three miles of Mount Sidney. Our cavalry went toward North Rivere (see plate ---*).

On the 2nd the enemy drove in our pickets near North River, and the Stonewall Brigade, of Gordon's division, drove them back and held the bridge. Our cavalry was engaged with the enemy at Bridgewater (see plate ---*). The 3rd and 4th were quiet, except some skirmishing along the line of North River.+ Gordon moved to near Naked Creek on the 5th, and Rosser's cavalry joined the army, having come up from Richmond, via Lynchburg. The enemy left his camps near Harrisonburg, Mount Crawford, and Bridgewater early on the morning of the 6th, after burning in every direction. Our cavalry was soon in pursuit, and the infantry, Gordon in front, followed at 11 a. m. and marched to the vicinity of Harrisonburg, three divisions beyond it. Lomax went by the Keezletown road to Peale's, and Rosser, with Fitz Lee's division, by the Back road, falling on the enemy's rear at Brock's Gap and capturing forges, & c. (see plate ---#). He then went to Timberville (see plate ---*). On the 7th we continued the march to New Market, Pegram in front, and encamped in the vicinity; Pegram and Wharton on the Timberville, Gordon and Ramseur on the Forest
