Senator from Connecticut if he has presented
this matter of the imprisonment of Hatch, or
rathor the complaint against General Babcock,
to the Secretary of State or to the President.
Has he called their attention to this complaint
against General Babcock?
Mr. PERRY. No ; I have not presented to
them any complaint against General Babcock;
and I have not presented a complaint against
General Babcock here. If the Chair will per-
mit me to state what seems to have been entirely
forgotten in the debate, what I have presented
is a memorial of a citizen of the United States
charging that he has been injured by an unjust
and illegal imprisonment on the part of the
Dominican Government; and I stated that, in
the evidence connected with and showing the
extent and character of that imprisonment, it
appears that General Babcock, then a commis-
sioner of the United States in San Domingo,
used his influence against the release of Mr.
Hatch, while the Department of State here was
endeavoring to procure his release, and was in
communication with our commercial agents
there, who, at the tune, were negotiating with
the Dominican Government to procure his
release; that at that very time General Bab-
cock used his influence against that relea.se upon
the ground, as he stated himself, that if released
Mr. Hatch would use influence against the con-
firmation of the treaty of annexation. That
was the substance of what 1 stated.
What 1 have presented here is a memorial
of Mr. Hatch, and I really intended to present
simply the wrongs of Mr. Hatch. I really
intended to have those wrongs investigated.
In the investigation of those wrongs this fact
regarding General Babcock came to my knowl-
edge upon such evidence as that 1 could not,
and I cannot, and 1 do not doubt its truthful-
ness. I do not know General Babcock. I
shall be exceedingly glad if it shall be proved
that the information which has been brought
to me is not true; but at this moment I believe
it to be true, every word of it; and 1 believe
that the Senator I'm in Nebraska, [Mr. Thayer,]
within a week, will himsell believe it to be true.
But that is merely incidental; it is a part of the
evidence in the case ot .Mr. Hatch, showing the
wrongs winch he has endured by this long
imprisonment at the hands ot the Dominican
Government. I have not presented any charge
against General Babcock to the Piesidcni nor
to the State Department.
Mr. THAYER. The Senator from Con-
necticut has certainly heard but one side of
the question.
Mr. PERKY. Certainly not.
Mr. THAYER. And yet he avows his con-
viction that the charges are true. _ I leave it, to
the Senate to say whether that is not a pre-
judgment of the case. Why does he declare
to the Senate his conviction? Was it his duty
to do so? Is he anxious to forestall the judg-
ment; of the Senate, when ho has heard but an
exparts stii foment of the alleged io.ets r" ! say
to my friend from Connecticut that, m my judg-
ment, he has prejudged the ease. A judge
should hear both sides before he pronounces
judgment.
But, sir, I rose to ask him it he had pre-
sented this complaint against General Babcoci<
to the Secretary ot StnXG or to tnc President.
I understand that he has not done so. Gen-
eral Babcock was sent out as a commissioner
by the President. He was responsible directly
to the President for his official acts. I say to
theSenatorfrom Connecticut that his first duty
was to present the ease to the Secretary ot
State or to the President, to have given the
President an opportunity to investigate the
acts of his commissioner. Why does the Sen-
ator bring it to the Senate? Why does he ride
over the President to bring it here ? There was
but one course to take, in my judgment, and
that was to leave this matter to the President
for him to take action; and then, if the Pres-
ident allorded no redress, if he took no cogni-
zance of the case, the next remedy was to
appeal to the Senate of the United States.
General Babcock was an officer of the Presi-
dent, his agent, immediately responsible to
him. Now, let me ask the Senator further,
has he asked for redress for the wrongs done
to this citizen of the Secretary of State or the
President? I mean in answer to the petition
which is now presented here.
Mr. PERRY. I think if the Senator will
wait until the committee, which is about, as I
trust, to be appointed, shall report, he will
ascertain from the evidence before that com-
mittee what papers have been laid before the
State Department upon this subject. He will
ascertain that since last December efforts have
been made, lirst, to obtain the release of Mr.
Hatch, which efforts were successful some
time in the month of May, I think; and he
will ascertain a sufficient reason, an abundant
reason for presenting the memorial of Mr.
Hatch to the Congress of the United States.
1 do not wish to take now from my desk and
read papers bearing upon the very question
which the Senator suggests. I have papers
bearing upon that very question. In my judg-
ment it was proper and right to present to the
Congress of the United States these wrongs
inflicted upon a citizen of the United States;
and in choosing the place where I should go
for redress I think I have done right as a lep-
iesentative of a constituent of mine residing in
my own State.
Mr. THAYER. I must be permitted to ask
the Senator from Connecticut if the State
Department or the executive department have
failed to obtain the necessary redress?
Mr. HOWE. Will the Senator from Ne-
braska allow me to make a suggestion to him?
Mr. THAYER. Certainty.
Mr. HOWE. He will observe that it is now
almost two o'clock, and he will remember that
there is really no question in dispute. All par-
ties n re willing that there should be a reference
of this matter, and thev are agreed as to the
direction it shall take. Now, I ask the Senator
if we cannot just let it take that direction, and
postpone this debate for the present?
Mr. THAYER. I should have been through
before this time if I had not been interrupted.
My friend will bear in mmd that I do not often
take up much of the time of the Senate.
Mr. HOWE I am aware ol that.
Mr. 'THAYER. I only wanted to bring out
this (act that instead of applying to the execu-
tive department of the Government for redress
the application was made to the Senate, at least
so far as 1 am informed.

tion is on ihe adoption of tho resolution.
