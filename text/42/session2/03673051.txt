1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
3051
The unbroken testimony of experience cor-
- roborates this statement. There is no staple
article of home manufacture which has estab-
lished itself on a sure foundation under that
care of its own Government, which secures for
it fair play and equality of competition in our
own market, which has not steadily diminished
in cost to the consumer. I do not mean to say
that that tendency to reduction has been always
- strong enough to counteract the opposite effect
of outside and independent causes. Thus the
inflation of the currency has been too power-
ful to be counteracted by the laws of competi-
tion, the fruits of invention stimulated by the
opportunity this legislation secures, and thecon-
fidenoe in long reaches which stability inspires.
So, too, local taxes and outlays, unusual casu-
alties and disturbances in the currents of trade
may temporarily work a like result. But in
the long run a permanent policy, securing the
home market, concentrates energy and enter-
prise, invites capital, multiplies production
through invention, tempts competition till
prices reach the lowest possible level of re-
munerative production. No better illustration
of thi3 law can be found than in the manufac-
ture of nails, an article of prime necessity and
of universal consumption. At the beginning of
this century they cost about twenty-five centsa
pound, and were wrought out, each single nail,
by hand at a forge. The contrast in the condi-
tion of the manufacture then, and as we see it
now, is best told in an extract from a speech of
Fisher Ames in the discussions of the first tariff
bill in 1789—only two days after the orgauiza-
tionofthe Government. He said he —
" Thought this a useful and accommodating man-
ufacture, which yielded a clear gain of all it sold for
exempt the cost of rbe material. The hibnr employed
in it was such as, it' not thus employed, would in
many instances bo thrown away. It had become
usualfor the, country people to erect small forges in
their chimney-corners, and in the winter eveninss,
when little other work could be done, great quanti-
ties of nails were mado even by children. Those peo-
ple took the rod iron of the merchant and returned
him nails, and in consequence of this easy mode of
barter the manufacture was prodigiously groat."
Under the policy then adopted, which secured
to the laborer of this country the right to per-
form this kind of labor for the country, this
manufacture has gone on in improvement, and
consequent yearly reduction in price, tiil now,
by the most wonderful automatic machinery,
iron is transformed into nails by thousands of
instruments more rapidly at each than one can
count, and at a cost of scarce a fraction beyond
that of the iron itself. And now nails flow
into use in every department of industry. The
inventions through which this marvel is at-
tained are just as much the result of the stim-
ulant the home market created as any other,
and born of them is the wonderful mechan-
ism which carries this manufacture one step
fuither and produces the wood-screw iu all its
varieties of form and size.
In all this no account is taken of the effect
of homo production for a home market upon
the ability of a nation to consume those pro
ducts. Home production and consumption
combined arc the tests of national wealth, and
the reflox influence of each upon the other is a
fixed law of national growth. The more a
nation produces for its own markets the more
it will be able to consume, it is otherwise if
it, produces only lor foreign markets and strives
for that end to cheappn the cost of production
till labor is starved and pinched and impover-
ished, thereby disabling, as in the case of
England to-day. Turn from that picture to
the amazing exhibition of the statistics of
increase of production in this country, which
my colleague on the committee from New
York [Mr. E. H. Roberts] read to the House
from the census a day or two since. That in-
crease on manufactures alone was, in 1870,
$4,302,452,016against $1,685,861,676 in 1860;
sn increase uf one hundred and twenty-tight
per cent.
Whose heart did not swell with exultant
pride at this proof of the development and
growth of this country? Let my other colleague
upon the committee, from New York city,
[Mr. James Brooks,] no longer sigh that he
did not see boxes of American shoes or shovels
floating down some hard-named river in Japan
or China, never heard of before, when he can
regale his sight with the crowded marts and
thoroughfares and storehouses of our own land,
to its remotest limits, bursting with the very
fatness of increased home production.
Mr. Chairman, if I have dwelt too long upon
these reasons for adherence to the policy which
has produced these results, and paid too little
attention to the arguments of my distinguished
colleagues upon the committee who urge an
abandonment of that policy, and with it our
own markets to foreign producers, it has not
been that I have failed to appreciate their abil-
ity or to acknowledge their sincerity. Although
I have been a faithful student both in the com-
mittee-room and on this floor of all they have
uttered. I confess that they bewilder me.
They beckon me different and opposite ways
at the same time. No man ever yet, attempted
with success to travel in opposite directions at
the same time, but when a third turns up
before bis bewildered eyes ordinary capacity
fails.
The gentleman from Indiana, [Mr. Kerr,]
from Illinois, [Mr. Buuchard,] and from Mis-
souri, [Mr. Fixkelxburg,] all members of
the committee, have at different times hereto-
fore and during this debate attacked the ex-
isting system of tariff duties. The gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Kerr] declares their pur-
pose and effect to be the establishment of
•'monopolies," "odious, hateful monopolies,"
with exclusive privileges secured to them by
law from which others were shut out. In a
speech delivered here not long since under the
the hour rule, he pronounced them " monop-
olies " twenty-one times by actual count.
Sometimes they were "'hateful," "bloated,"
'•corrupt," butalways" monopolies," against
which he raised his " solemn voice," besides
entering his "solemn protest." Yesterday
they were " plunderers and robbers."
The gentleman from Illinois, [Mr. Bouch-
ard,] on the contrary, says that the aim of
the system is just the opposite; that it seeks
to divert capital into these pursuits from
others, and forces labor from other employ-
ments into these, and even offers bounties to
both capital and men to leave other pursuits
and engage in these. Three hundred thousand
men, he says, are under it pensioned more
than all the pensioners of the war, by bounties
and high wages, to induce them to leave other
employments for these. Then comes the gen-
tleman from Missouri, [Mr. Fikkelnburg,]
right in between these gentlemen, and in a
speech lately delivered on the " relations of
tariffs to wages" he insists that these men
who go into what they call the protected em-
ployments not only do not get any bounty, but
do not get even decent wages. He says that
they are ground down in abject poverty, and
are growing poorer and ragged every day.
And he read reports from my own State to
show the misery and distress of the very oper-
atives who in the eyes of the gentleman from
Illinoij [Mr. Burchard] were bounty-paid
pensioners, till, as the gentleman informed
us, his heart was "sick."
Now, I might well leave these three col-
leagues on the committee pointing their guns
at each other and abide patiently the result—
for no triangular duel between skillful and
trained marksmen like these ever failed of a
success—were it not that all of them are mis-
taken, and neither has either sound argumentor
authentic information to support his position.
That cannot be a "monopoly" which is
open to every man, woman, and child in the
land to participate in all its privileges and
profits. There is no production except such as
patent laws to make a monopoly, because the
property of the man who invented it, to which
anybody is not perfectly free to apply his cap-
ital or his labor, and from which nothing but
considerations of personal advantage will ever
deter him.
Why, sir. look at the growth within the last
ten years of that, very manufacture toward
which the intensity of the language and hos-
tile action of the gentleman from Indiana [Mr.
Kerr] seems especially directed, the woolen
manufacture. I have a table here from that
gx-eat confessional of the nation, the census,
which shows for 1860 and 1870, arranged bv
