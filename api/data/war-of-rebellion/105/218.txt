SIR: I have the honor to report that the detachment of which mention was made in my last have all returned. Captain Currey with his detachment of twenty men returned last evening, having been five days out, and having made the entire circuit of Malade River to Salmon Falls. Finding fresh signs of Indians passing from this valley toward Snake River, he followed their trail, crossing Malade several times until he arrived in the vicinity of the falls, when he came upon a camp of seventeen lodges, which he immediately surrounded, but the Indians appeared defenseless, and made such demonstrations of friendship that he could not, with any regard for humanity, assault them. Accordingly he made captives of two leaders of their number and brought them with him to this camp. He found in all about 200 Indians in the vicinity of the falls engaged in fishing. They were apparently destitute, having little or no stock. Salmon Falls are almost due south and about sixty miles from here by the nearest route. Malade empties into Snake River about twelve miles below them. I have interrogated the Indians brought in by Captain Currey without being able to ascertain from them any clue to the whereabouts of any captive whites or the animals stolen by their tribe. They say, "The bad Indians are all gone to the buffalo country. " I shall release them to-day. I shall move from here to-morrow or next day. It is supposed to be 130 to 140 miles from here to Fort Hall.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. F. MAURY,

Colonel First Cavalry Oregon Volunteers, Commanding.

GENERAL: The scouting parties sent out on my arrival in this valley have returned. The one (Captain Currey's) going to Salmon Falls found a few families at that point, mostly without arms or property of any kind and professing great friendship. A ferry has been established there. The owners live there unmolested, and represent the Indians in the vicinity as perfectly harmless. They are poor and depend upon fish for a living. If nothing occurs to prevent, I will cross the river at the falls on my return and give the streams entering on the south of Snake River a thorough search; perhaps, if time and circumstances permit, visit the headwaters of Owyhee and Malheur, meeting my supplies for the return to Walla at Malheur River. The Indians at the falls,
