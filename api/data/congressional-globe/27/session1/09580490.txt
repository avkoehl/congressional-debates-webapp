legedseats in tills Ha ), Ido not remember It was in tow wise
that a man may now ti av erse hai Í the Siatetaof ihe ""Union on
railroads while an honorable member of Congress is making
a speech' Wei"! this was, indeed, a monstrous abuse, and not
to be endured by the people since men tiavelfast, they must
learn to think fast and to speak fast, they must learn to go un
der afull hea of steam This stopping by the way to take oo
serv&tions, or lingering to p etc up oeautiful flowers, or enjoy
beiuuful prospects, as has sometimes been done in oiatory—
the «me for all this hasgone by It was well enough m such
meo as Burke, and Windham, and Canning, and Mirabeau, and
PainclcHeniyjand Fisher Ames, but we must thank God re
verendy that we are wiser, as they would have been, no doubt,
if there bad been steam in their days Only tbmk, Mr Chair
mac what a capital aid to condensation is tnis one hour system
No steam engine was ever supplied with a moré complete con
densing apparatus than this House now is
Well, s ) it is now understood that a Congressional otator
goes j usft one hour You wind mm up by a parliamentary law,
lie rises  and, like the pointer of a eloeir, describes his exact
circuit on the parliamentary dial plate, andthen stops—hi; has
run down But no matter, there is a great saving of time m
this. And, besides, it is very Democrática!, nobody can deny
that All men are equal—if not, they ought to be That, I
think, is now the doctrine My colleague over the way [Mr
McJKeon] can tell Is not this the tendency of the time? Are
not railroads bringing down distinctions? Why, a poor man
may now travel as far and as last as th<- rich, ard make about as
much display m doing so And so here, we have come to the
end of ambitious displays in oiatory m this House, we have
seeu an endof youi tnree day and yourthree hour orator , we
are all now, all, one hour orators, on a principle of stuct Be
mocratic equality And we carry our Democratic no ions
fmther still, for we have disc®veted that subjects and topics
are all equal, as Well as persons, and that, at any i ite, no sub
ject is fit to be brought before this House for consideration
which a member may not despttch, m all its merits, m one
hour,, while H is very properly taken foi granted that there is
no man on this floor who cannottell all he knows on any subject
m one hour
Yes, sir, belt known to all people that we here mount m turn,
and each perfoimer rides around the ring forjust one hour
And, of couroe, he who displays in that time the greatest
amount of skill and the greatest numbei of astonishing ieatsin
jockeyship will bo entitled to the greatest applause from the
whole circus—from pit togallery
Well, Mr Cnanman I am now mounted, and off, but, hefoie
I go, let m« say one word moie I n if betabel feel myself
bound, in home measure by my oiigmal undertaking, todoso
as one of the troupe and not because 1 expect to win anything
for myself, or bring much golden profit to the company
Mr Chairman, we have now a proposition before us for
funding twelve milhonsof public debt, or more or less, at the
discretion of tfe Pi sident, but not to exceed that sum, for
eight years, the stock, nowever to be purchasable by the Go
vernmeiU m the mean lime as ¡t ir ay have the mean^ofpur
chase
What s,dy the Opposition to this? Why they say this is bor
rowmg money and cieatmg a public debt I answer, it is bor
rowing money, hut it is not ciea^ine a debt The debt exnts
already, and wepiopo^e to do what they declined or neglected
to do when they hid the power—we ptopose to pay it And
wethmkit was they who crea ed the debt, inasmuch as they
had long adrmwsteied htG^vernment and when tbevwentout
and we came in, on the lourth of Mari h last we found the debt on
hand, and, whether they cieated it or not, thrre is one thing
which no man can dimbt who will look into the puhhc and
official documents on the subject, and that is that a debt actually
exiaa, that it s ihe debt of thecoumry—the debt ofthe nation—

already mentioned for the items arid the nece^ary explanat ons
In regardto them
But I have been charsei with having computed the debts of
the Government,m thatspeech at forty millions This is a
gross perversa, if it be not malicious    I alluded on that oc«
casion to \ anotts claims aaains' the Government   and w i ^us  |

claims and liabilities was such as weie, or micht, an 1 probably  i
would, comebefoie  Congiess   for   Us decision      They were   1
enumerated in tables, and were added to  the items of a^cer
tamed debt, not for the pui pose of shown g how much the Go- >
vernment then actually owed,but to show how much, in addition  l
to ah current expenses the new A Immigration m'girtbe called
on to piovide foi in the course ofthe next four years    I have
seen no rea-on  yetto change my opinion in regard to the
amountofbuidens which the Treasury may be compelled to
b ar, besides and beyond all current expenses, m the course of
the current term ofthe new Administration
But let this pas3 My present purpose is to deal only with
the debt which has bsen created for current expenses of the Go
vernment and entailel outhe present Administration I have
stated this debt already to be not less than nine and a half
millions of dollar*5 namely six millions outstandmg m Tiea
sury notes on the fourrh of March beyond the available means
in the Treasuij, to which must be added a deficit ofthreeand
a half millions move at the end of the present vear supposing
Coistess had not beea called together at the present time
And this debt we say was created b> you, who are now the
Opposition paify And if you did not create it supposing it. to
have sprung up out of the earth without any bodv's agency,
yet thei e it was, you saw it, as evei y body else saw it and you
made no provision for it, and no effort whatever to meet it
We have come into power, and we make it our first business
to provide for the payment of this debt Now, it is said that i
certain paity m this country has hel 1 and still holds, that a na
tional debt is a national blessing No party which I have evei
read of or heard of, m this country, ever held any such doc
tune, butsupp03e it was so held and is so held, and suppose
that all such are federalists^—to give them an odious name—
which of the two parties now m being is the party of the na
tional debt? Who are the Federalists'? those who create
the debt, or those who would pay it, those who have conferred
the blessing on the country, if it be one or those who have
takenthe promptestmeasmes for wipngitoñ? But, because
we have exhibited and stated the debt, and propo-e to paj it,
you mean to escape from the ju«t responsibility of your posi
tion by cry ing out national debt' national debt' and pointing
to us as the guilty parly \ou cannot doit The people have
puta mark upon you The mcendiarv was «een wi h the
bran1 in his hand, wi h which he fired the edifice he was
<¡coi chad in the act an I the louder be cries nr?, the more is at
ttntion attiacte 1 towards him, anl finally, as the flames mount
up andthedarkne s is illuminated, all eyesare fastened on the
conscious face of the true cnlpi it
But my colleague [Mi McKeom ] if I could understand hiq
aigument, cannoi. consent that the Government shall borrow
money to pay its pressing deb's because that money-
may be borrowed of foreign capitalists He is against
oiu borrowing money abtoad f r any puipose It ena
blislips a dangp rms foieiCTn influence m this country,
he is aft aid of the Bothschild*, and the Hopes,
and the Barings, and beems to app ehend that the time is
clos<> at hand if it have not airea ly ome, when a few bankers
in Europe are to dictate the policy and measures ofthe Amen

on the consequence that must ensue if one o** the independent

calara urns and so disgiaceful, we migrt have to deal with
more than ba*lkeis Can it be supposed that Governments will
sit still and set, thtircubjects robbed of their pioreri) by acts
of peifidy andliaud, peipetrated by the individual States of
this Union? And if they move at 11 in such a matter, agamst
what party will they movel Will it be the fttates, or the
Union? What do fot eign nations know of the States of this
Unisn, which have not, and cannot have, any representative
charactei abioad?   They know us as one nation, and m no
0 her way They know nothing, and ought to know nothing,
about that which gives some of us so much concern, nanr eiy,
our domestic doctrine of State Rights They have one re
sponsible party to deal with in ail matters of national concern
ment, namely, the Federal Government, which is enough for
their purposes Sir, this is nota subiect—it is too setieus—to
be seized hold of and agitated forthe sake of party It belongs
to the countiy and the whole conntry, to its character, us jus
tice, and its honor, and it may involve its peace
Let it not be said that I am favoring the assumption ofthe
State debts bythisGoveinment    INo hmg oí the son    What
1 mean to assert, aud all I mean to assert, is, that this Govern-
ment, and the whole country, have the deepen mteres* at
stake m that tearful and di graceful question which has some
times been permitted tobe agitated, whether some of the States
might or might not repudiate their foreign debt And I rejoice,
v. ith a heart full of joy when I find that, by a simple act of
justice towards the States, quae too long delayed, this Govern
ment car, by undoubted constitutional means, at by the passage
of the land distribution bill, bring substantial aid and strong en
couragement to those States, whrh are struggling to relieve
themselves from heavy burdens, too hastily and recklessly in-
curred Asaiu I commend this subject to the careful and ear*
nest thought and consldei ation of all
But I must come back to consider *he necessity of this loan,
as proposed in the bill before us, from which I have been drawn
off, very unwillingly, by my colleague
Some gentlemen have gone so far as to deny that there is any
such debt, and that there will be any such deficit as has been
stated Of couise they condemn the calling of this session of
Congress, and they deny that it is necessary to laise a dollar by
loan I will not call this factious, but it looks wonderfully like
h A brief view of our financial condition for the year 1811,
supposing no extraordinary session had been held will show
