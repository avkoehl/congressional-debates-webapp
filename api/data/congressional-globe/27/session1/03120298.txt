1833, from fifty to seventy five per cent and th>s
in a period of profound peace Before 1833, fur
near twenty years, those expen^eb in peace had
ranged§ fiom tnly 'hree to four millions It va*
then submitted to Congress by the Department that
they onght seldom, if ever, except in w*r, to ex-
ceed four mil'ions. Yet most improviclemly, by
gradual mareases of the establishment, hatd!y no-
ticed at th* time—by increaceo 01 p^y to the offi-
cers—by increases of prices in rations and con-
tracts, through expansions m bi^k issues—the
naval expenses have now b come afmost doub'eri.
Every gun aflcat, and every man afloat, costs near
thirty per cent, more, beside she augmeniation of
the whole number of officer  aud of the pay and
expenses on ho e Th <j, is a fiscal point or view,
was cauce of just a arm Under ¡hese circum-
stance Mr. W. was opposed to let this bill pass
Without an amendment which should project the
Treasury from this great additional butden, now
for the fiis timea'temp ed
It was not, as some aigued, warranted by the
act of 1837 That related, by us preamble, to th"
trust fund alone ; that *ví s, at the time, and sirte,
construed to impose claims o*a that fund alone; and
that led to the i^sue of cer lficati-s of pensious on
that fund alone. If we now place them on the
Treasury, instead of that fund, we %o beyond the
requirements, not only of law and equiiy, not on'y
of contracts, and ves'ed rights, but even of honor,
or any reasonable and just expectation The pen-
sions ua'er the act of 18á7 had been liberally tita'-
ed by being put on ihc trt si fund aloae To put
them also oi the Treasury, after having wanfd
that fund, would be a mere gratuity, and at a time,
too, when the T rasury, with al! lis efforts, is up-
posed to be unable to fulfil Un !e¿al obligations
without loan&. Moca le^s should we, m such an
emeigenc), g ve away ns. resoun eo to c bj c , ma-

tlieFiench Minister (Mr F supposed) bad thought it should
properly be sent to the fiscal ofhoer of the Government     This
was a mistake, and whilst, he repeated, he concurred m all
that the gentleman from Massachusetts had «an on the point
of propriety, he would ask whe her a compliance with are
quest of the House xt&eli could be regarded a¡> a vio! ition of
lib privilege? These were the facts of the case, and he had
thought proper to state them for the information of the House
It was also due to the Fiench xMi.nstei to state that he (Mr
£ ) had not the honor of a personal acquaintance with that gen
tlerAjn
Some further conversation followed between Mt ADAMS
and Mr FILI MORE, when
Mr B0TP8 rose and said that we were com ng very near

other day by a memhei flora Indiana, (Mr FaoroT) of hasty
and mdisscreet legislation He (Mr B ) thought that the House
mast now be satisfied that there was nothing m this matter

the whole subject en the table

Fl-CAL BANK
On me'ion of Mi SLRGE-VNT, the Hou<=e íe^olved i «elf
into Committee of the Whole on the state (f the Union, (Mr
John C CxAm of jSew "ioikm the chair) on the bill to in
coipoiate tne suhaC-i ibers> to a Iiscal Bank of the United
S aie 
Tlie question being on the motion of Mr McClellapi to strike
out he enacting clause of the bill
Mr POPE who was entitled tuthe flooi, addiessed the com-
mittee at length, in suppoit of the bill Mr P said it was with
grcatieluctance that he addiessed the committee on a subject
on which he had, thnty yeais ago, ¡said all that he could say in
favoi of the power and the policy of the establishment of a
National Bank, and winch, during the last five years, he had so
often discussed upon the stump And he confessed that he felt
some difficulty m bringing himself up to any thing like the
point oí animation uquibite toenab'efnmto present his views
Noi would he have said a woid but foi the paiticular relation
he bore to hiscorstituents they would be smpnsedif he were
to give a silent vote on a question on which he had staked his
election three or four times He had not talked to his constitu
ents about letienchmen and the many various and mmoi
points wmch had been biought into the canvass, but he had
hxed upon one impoitant point, and he had staked his cause
uj. on that
As to what was public opinion upon this question of a Na
nona! Bank, he thought theie could now b* no cortro\ersy
lie to  k it f)i tldn *-d lnat every eentleman here, on whatever
side I e might vote, wis to b legaided is, the *aiihful oigan
of the constituents bv whom they had all been so íecently
returned to this body, and as the faithful exponents of their
view  And if it ¡should be found thar a onjoiity of he mem
beis of thifa Hou^e decided m favor of a INatioi at Bank he
shoald regard hat tact as conc'usive evidence of the public
will
Foi himself, he felt bound to vote for a Bank m the best foim
m which he cou d get it II he could not get exactly what he
wmtcd, he woe id taivcihe best tint he could get
