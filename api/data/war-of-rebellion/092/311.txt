prisoners taken, and until 8. 30 a. m. of the 21st were the only organized body of our troops in the city. Casualties have been heretofore reported in detail, a summary of which is hereto attached; also a comparative statement of the effective force at the commencement and close of the campaign.

Too much cannot be said in praise of the soldierly conduct of the men of this command generally throughout the campaign, and particularly since the occupation of this city; and the officers, with few exceptions, were worthy leaders of the men. Those who constitute the exceptions will not accompany us on the next campaign. My personal and departmental staff are hereby mentioned as exceedingly competent and faithful. The distance marched by this command from the time of leaving Atlanta until the occupation of Savannah was 325 miles.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. A. BARNUM,

Colonel 149th New York Volunteers, Commanding Brigade.
