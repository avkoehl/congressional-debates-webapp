Captain NORTON:

The gun-boat Mackinaw keeps the Signal Hill battery pretty quiet; our monitors not firing. The Onondaga fired a few shots some time since. Two of the rebel rams fire occasionally, and the 100-pounder at Battery Sawyer. The 100-pounder at Dutch Gap was fired twice. One ram lies down nearly to Dutch Gap; another is behind the group of houses at Cox's Ferry. A number of wounded have been brought over.
