been paid for, then say, in the column of remarks opposite his name, "Elected (or appointed) at [Baltimore, July 28,] and joined by transfer, from [sergeant] in Captain [John Smith's] company, in which he was enrolled at [Baltimore] the [25th of July]-the distance [125] miles to be paid for as [sergeant."] (See paragraph 25.)

34. The rolls of field and staff will embrace the names of the medical and other officers, including chaplain, appointed by the Governor or other authority and assigned to the regiment, with dates of appointments, and in the column of remarks when joined for duty. Also the names of adjutant and quartermaster, (who will perform also the duties of commissary of subsistence, if there be none by commission with the regiment,) with the date of staff appointment, and the remarks, as in the preceding paragraph, in relation to when appointed, and his company-if the regiment is artillery-and the rate for distance traveled.

35. Where no quartermaster or commissary, appointed by competent authority, is present with the regiment, or with one or more companies when detached by legal authority, the colonel or commanding officer will assign a lieutenant to the duty-he will act in both departments with detachments-who will be mustered on field and staff roll for the established extra pay for the time of such service.

36. The roll on which any person is properly mustered will show by grade when last paid, and by remarks everything that is necessary in relation to his pay, &amp;c., without the necessity of referring to any other or previous roll.

CHANGES OF GRADES, PROMOTIONS, REDUCTIONS.

37. The names of all persons must be among those of the grade (according to relative rank, or if privates, alphabetically) to which they belong at the time of the muster to be made. If a person has been appointed or promoted within the period embraced, or since he was last paid, say, in the column of remarks: "Appointed (or elected or promoted, as the case may be) from [private, July 28,"], and if he came from another company, say, "Appointed (or elected, &c.) from [sergeant in Smith's] company [July 28,] and joined by transfer, order of Colonel [Todd."] If reduced within the time as above, say, "Reduced from [sergeant, July 28,] by sentence of regimental court-martial," or "Reduced from [sergeant, July 28,] by order of Colonel [Tod,"] or otherwise, as may be necessary.

38. If one man has been appointed or promoted in place of another, say (following the date as above,) "vice [Wood,] resigned, deceased, discharge, transferred, or promoted," as the case may be.

SICK, WOUNDED IN BATTLE, AND IN CONFINEMENT, PRESENT.

39. For such cases, say 'sick," or "wounded in battle of [Palo Alto] and in hospital," or "in confinement," whichever may be proper.

40. The tours, by daily detail, of officers and men for guard and other duties at camp, will not be regarded on muster-rolls. All such will be reported as present. It is desirable, where the service will admit, that those on such duties may be called off for muster while their regiments are on parade; and also that the sick and confined, as far as practicable, be with their companies. This will save much time and greatly facilitate the labor of the mustering officer and captain.
