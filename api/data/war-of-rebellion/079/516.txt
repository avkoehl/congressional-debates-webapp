Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Saint Cloud Hotel:

Five trains of General Wood's troops have departed, the sixth will leave soon. We are all right for cars south. General Easton has directed flats to be loaded south, which leaves us in good shape both north and south.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

The enemy is reported to-night crossing Tennessee River at Bainbridge, and General Croxton (who sends the report) says he cannot doubt its truth. I am informed, by order of General Sherman, that Atlanta will not be occupied a week hence, and I prepare to withdraw to Chattanooga within that time. I send cipher men, two with General Sherman and one with each corps headquarters, but no field force or equipments for constructing lines.
