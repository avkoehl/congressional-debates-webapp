LOUISVILLE, July 8, 1863-9.24 a.m.

General HARTSUFF:

Rebels have small forces at different points. Dispatch from Lebanon says a rebel force is approaching that place. Morgan sent force to Brandenburg, which captured two steamboats and started down river. I ordered gunboats from New Albany there, and telegraphed for gunboats at Evansville to come up. About 75 rebels were at Simpsonville. Shelby and others reported to have crossed Frankfort Railroad to Oldham County. Morgan's main force is going out by Litchfield, &amp;c. I ordered the Twentieth Kentucky to fall back to Camp Nelson, as they are without arms.

LOUISVILLE, July 8, 1863-10.30 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

The following just received, dated July 8, on the march via Bardstown Junction:

I have reliable information that Morgan has gone in direction of Brandenburg. His object may be to cross through the State below Bowling Green. He knows if he attempts to return by Hodgensville, Greensburg, and Columbia, that he will meet my infantry. This intelligence should be communicated to General Judah.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

I have telegraphed this to General Manson at Munfordville, and ordered him to send courier at once to Judah.

HEADQUARTERS, Louisville, July 8, 1863-10.45 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Morgan sent force to Brandenburg, on the river, and captured two steamboats yesterday afternoon, and placed men on board and started down. I sent boat with force, but not in time. I ordered gunboat at New Albany down river early this morning, and telegraphed the facts, and ordered gunboats at Evansville. Is there any reason to believe that other forces are coming in to aid Morgan? Dispatches from Lebanon represent force approaching there. I believe there are several bands of 50 to 100 at different points.

Major-General HARTSUFF:

The following just received:

MUNFORDVILLE, July 8.

Can't you give me some information in relation to the road Morgan has taken? I can cut him off I can get the direction he has taken. Colonel Brooks has information that Wheeler, with a large force, is crossing Green River, between Columbia and Lebanon, at the bridge; that one brigade crossed at 12 o'clock last night. He says that this has been further confirmed, but he has some doubt of the truth.
