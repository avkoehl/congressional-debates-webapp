turous expedition, and, without the sanction of your judgment, I should hesitate to grant the permission. His own special command (represented as a small brigade of cavalry) is stated to be in irregular and rather disorderly force, and if he could be permanently detached, sent with it to cut Sherman's communication, and required to report to General Wheeler, so that he and his men could be brought under the discipline and control of a regular army organization, I have no doubt it would be advantageous to the service. I fear, however, such disposition of his force at this time would not be expedient, and certainly not unless it meet the approval of your judgment, and the substitution of some other force in Southwestern Virginia could be provided. I shall give no instructions in answer to General Morgan's telegram, but submit his movements to your discretion and control.

Very truly, yours,

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
