GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,

No. 24. June 18, 1864.

The commanding general takes great pride in assuring this command of the nigh appreciation in which their services, after the fatigues of the recent movement, are held at the headquarters of the army, and quotes with pleasure the expression used by the commanding general of the Army of the Potomac in speaking of the brilliant assault on the morning of the 17th. He writes: "It affords me great satisfaction on congratulate you and you gallant corps on the successful assault on the morning of the 17th. Knowing the wearied condition of your men from the night march of over twenty-two miles and the continued movement through the night of the 16th, their persistence and success is highly creditable."

The commanding general can only add that in this, as in the previous and succeeding events of this unexampled campaign, the Ninth Corps has through every trial invariably proved true to its history and to its promise.

By command of Major-General Burnside:

LEWIS RICHMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
