The batteries of horse artillery will reduce the number of ammunition chests on the caisson body to one, which will be arranged so as to sit over the axle, as in the Sixth New York Battery (Martin's). The remaining chests will be kept full. But one spare wheel to the section will be taken by each field battery of the army; the remainder will be turned into the ordnance department.

To reduce the weight, only six fellows, twelve spokes, one jack-screw, and one splinter-bar will be carried in the battery wagon.
