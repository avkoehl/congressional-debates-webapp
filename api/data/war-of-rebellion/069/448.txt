farther, and batteries cannot be taken through the woods until I drive back the enemy's skirmishers, which I will do as soon as we get our new line arranged. My left rests on an impassable swamp, about half a mile southeast of the church. The enemy's intrenchments, so far as I can learn, extend across both roads.

Respectfully,

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,Bethesda Church, June 1, 1864-12 m.

Major-General MEADE:

The enemy fires at us with rifled guns and light 12-pounders on the direct road to Cold Harbor, and we are within canister range. The troops moving to our left we seem to have seen the tail of. When we opened on them they were seen to start on the double-quick and the officers to use their swords to hurry them up. On the right and left of this place are very difficult swamps, and I find it necessary to reconnoiter ahead in order to move my troops in any connected manner. Skirmishing is lively in places. Everybody is at work.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

BETHESDA CHURCH,

June 1, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General MEADE:

I have extended my line now so that it is nearly all taken up as a single line of battle. The enemy is strongly entrenched along my whole front. When my skirmishers first advanced they ran back to their works, but have come out again, and I have sharp skirmishing along the line. The enemy has three batteries in position, and they cross-fire over this pot at an angle greater than 60 degrees. General Crittenden ought to keep up connection with my right. I have not heard from Major Roebling reconnaissance on my left. I have nothing much to attack with at any one point now, unless I break my line to form a column of assault. I believe that nothing but a strong attack can carry the enemy's position, and I must have a large force on hand to hold on with, which I have not. We have taken 3 prisoners from the skirmish line that advanced against [us]. They are from Longstreet's corps, and say that it was General Breckinridge's troops moving down to our left this morning. The telegraph line does not yet work. I do not hear any firing in the direction of Cold Harbor.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

The prisoners report General Ewell on their left, then Hill, then Longstreet, then Breckinridge, and that there is a good deal of maneuvering about.
