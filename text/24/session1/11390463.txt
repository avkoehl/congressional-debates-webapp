The attention of the people of Pennsylvania
was attracted to the subject of the surplus rev-
enue soon after the election of the present Chief
Masistrate In his first annual message to Con-
gress, on the 8th December, Ii-"29, the President,
in speaking of the situation of the financial con-
cerns of our country, says-
" \rter the e junction of the public debt it is not probable
thit anv adju-tment of the tiriff upon principles *ati«fac

t dtred  in  connection with  the difficulties which have

hoped that it rmv lead to the adoption of some plan which

«II    That hitherto adopted has, by many of our fellow
citizens, been deprecated as an infraction of the Con«titu
tion, while b) others it has been viewed as inexpedient
AM frel tint it has been emplo)ed at the expense of har
mom in the legislative councils    Toavoidtheseevils.it
appears to me that the most safe, just, and fedenl disposi
tion which could be made of the surplus revenue would
be its apportionment among the several States, according
to their rati") of representation , and should this measure
not be found warranted by the Constitution, that it w ould
be expedient to  propose to  the States an amendment
authorizing it "
Pennsylvania having engaged in an extensive
system of internal improvement, which required
large sums of money to be raised for the purpose
of conducting the expensive works under con-
tract, and completing them with as little delay as
possible, resorted to loans to meet the heavy
annual expenditure, which this magnificent pro-
ject required. As every year added to the liabil-
ities of the State, and the national Treasury
would in a short time be relieved from the public
debt, much solicitude was felt in relation to the
disposition of the surplus which would accrue
beyond the current expenses of the country.
The citizens of the'' Keystone "having assisted
to elevate the present Executive to that station
which he now fills with so much honor to him-
self and satisfaction to the people, received with
heartfelt pleasure the message announcing his
opinion " that the most safe, just, and federal
• disposition which could be made of the surplus
« revenue would be its apportionment among the
« several States, according to their ratio ofrepre-
« sentation;" and although he, at the same time,
expressed a doubt whether such a disposition
tras warranted by the Constitution, and suggested
that it would be expedient to amend it, to remove
tint doubt, yet the situation of Pennsylvania,
with hei aicumulating debt, was such, that all
piities concurred m the hope that these doubts
v\ ould bo removed when the time for distribution
nrrivtd, and that we should receive our share of
tin ¡surplus íevenue, and thus be lelicvcd from a
portion ot the inertasing debt whie,h the improve-
ment system hid cieated
Hav iii£r, at the period to which I allude, been
chosui by the citizens of my native State to rep-
resent thiinin another place, (the Senate of Penn-
sylvania,) I was among those who heartily re-
sponded to the sentiments of the President, and
t\v o of my colleagues on this floor [Mr Miller
and Mr Morris] assisted me in passing the fol-
lowing resolution, which, according to my recol-
lection, received almost, if not altogether, the
unanimous concurrence of wat body:
" Rejoiced, As the sense of the Senate and House of
Representative-, that, as soon as the national debt shall be
pud, the most equitable and just mode of disposing of the
surplus tunds which may remain in the ireasury of the
I nited States, alter defraying the ordinary expenses of the
Government and the payment of appropriations which may
be made to objects of great national importance, will be by
a distribution among-t the several States in proportion to
their representation in the Congress of the United States."
The constitutional power of Congress to dis-
tribute the surplus funds of the Treasury among
the States had not at that time been examined
with that care and scrutiny which it afterwards
received. Although the Piesident had intimated
its unconstitutionality, and suggested " an appeal
to the source of power as among the most sacred
of all our obligations," yet it was not till his veto
of the land bill of Mr Clay that his views on this
constitutional question became generally under-
stood. Since mat penod a difference of opinion
has existed, and still exists throughout the com-
munity, on this all-important subject; and I feel
that it is wholly "unnecessary to attempt its dis-
cussion on the present occasion. Let our object
rather be to avoid difficulties and embarrassments
of this nature, and pursue such a course as will
be sanctioned by every branch of our legislative
department. Let us steer clear of constitutional
objections from any quarter, and adopt such pro-
visions as will promote the welfare of the States i
without affecting the wholesome action of the '
General Government.
The resolution of the Legislature of Pennsyl-
vania which I have read reiterates and sanctions
the liberal, patriotic, and enlightened views of the
Executive of the Union, without expressing any
opinion of the constitutionality of the measure.
It cannot, therefore, be expected that I have so
far forgotten the part I took in the passage of
that resolution, as to be now opposed to a con-
stitutional disposition of the surplus money of
the Treasury. Every one must admit that it
ought to be taken from the deposit banks and
placed in the power of the people, to whom it
properly belongs, and who can safely apply it to
, such State objects as will increase their wealth
and advance their prosperity, and thus add to the
strength and stability of the whole Confederacy.
The next expression of public sentiment in
Pennsylvania in reference to the surplus revenue,
will be found in the proceedings of our Legisla-
ture, when Clay's land bill was under discussion
in this House during the session of 1832-33. It
was a subject which elicited the attention, and
addressed itself to the judgment of every legis-
lator; one in which it became the duty of the
Representative to ascertain and proclaim the
opinion and wishes of his constituents. On this
absorbing question there was no mistaking the
popular will, the same pervading sentiment ex-
isted throughout the Commonwealth that pre-
vailed in 1831; and again we find the Legislature
of Pennsylvania speaking emphatically, and with
great unanimity, the same language that they
had formerly used.
The proceeds of the public lands would, in a
short time, be no longer necessary to defray our
national burdens; and the question of distribu-
tion among the States addressed itself to their
consideration; they accordingly embodied their
sentiments in the following preamble and resolu-
tion:
"Whereas the period is fast approaching when, by
means of the revenue arising from bank stock, the duties
on imports, and the public lands, the natioml debt will bo
extinguished, and there wll be a surplus m the nafonal
Treisury after defi ljingthe ordinary evpen-es ot Govern-
ment And wherea- the United States acquired their title
to and jurisdiction over the public lands by the cessions of
several of the States, made for the common benefit of the
Union , and by purchase out of the funds of the Genenl
Government, ind the said lands thus acquired form a part
of the national stock, and furnish an important branch ol
the public revenues applicable to the relief of the public
burdens And when as, on the extinguishment of the
public debt of the United States, the revenues drawn from
the sale of the public lands will be no longer required for
the purposes of the General Government, and it is right
and proper that they should be distributed among the sev-
eral States And whereas the distribution of the surplus
proceeds arising from the sale of the public lands involves
a question of national property and national policy, on
which it is proper for the constituted authorities of the State
to express an opinion    Therefore, be it
11 Resohed by the Senate and House of Representative 
of the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania, That, in the opinion
of this Legislature, the proceeds of the public lands of the
United States, when no longer required for the payment of
the public debt, ought to be distributed among the several
States of the Union, in just and equitable proportions, and
any proper measure calculated to effect this object will
meet our cordial approbation
" Approved, 26th Feb , 1833. 
This preamble and resolution were laid before
Congress on the ls,t of March, 1833, and on the
next day the final question was taken on the land
bill, and although the Pennsylvania delegation
in Congress was not bound by this expression
of the State Legislature, as they were equally the
immediate Representatives of the people, yet it
is remarkable with what unusual unanimity, the
whole delegation (save one from the city of Phil-
adelphia) gave their votes in favor of the bill pro-
viding for the distribution of the proceeds of the
public lands.
At the next session the President gave his
reasons at length in opposition to the bill, which
he had been prevented fiom doing before, owing
to the lateness of the session at which it passed.
Whether he was right or wrong, it is not my
purpose now to inquire, as the present plan of
disposing of the surplus renders the inquiry
wholly unnecessary at this time. Nor do I wish
to be understood to say that I approve of raising
money from the sales of public lands, or from a
tariff on imports, for the purpose of distributing
it among the States; on the contrary, I believe
that the States ought not to look to the national
Government for pecuniary aid, they should de-
pend on their own resources to carry on their
improvements and supply their several wants.
But a number of causes have combined to swell
the funds of the public Treasury to an extrava-
gant amount, and the question naturally arises,
what shall be done with the surplus beyond the
immediate necessities of the country  If it re-
mains dormant in the banks, its accumulation
will embarrass trade and seriously affect the
mercantile community. If loaned to individuals
in the vicinity of the deposit banks, the benefits
to result will at least be partial. If squandered
on public national works, it would in all proba-
bility lead to wasteful extravagance. The safest
and most judicious course would seem to be to
deposit the excess with the States, and to pro-
vide that in future the revenues of the country
shall not be suffered to accumulate beyond the
wants of the Government.
I have referred to the proceedings of our State
Legislature, and to the votes of my predecessors
here, to show the cordial understanding that ex-
isted in favor of distribution while the destinies
of Pennsylvania were in the hands of those who
were the warm and devoted friends of the present
national Executive; but before I conclude, in
order to show that all parties concur m these
sentiments, let me call the attention of the com-
mittee to what has been done since the scepter
has departed from the Democracy of our btate
and been placed in hands in which, although 1
possess little confidence, and therefore pay but
slight attention to their request, yet, as emanating
from a majority of the State Legislature, it merits
a proper and respectful consideration.
On the 15th of March, 1836, the following
preamble and resolution passed the Legislature
of Pennsylvania, and were transmitted by the
Governor to the delegation in Congress:
« Whereas, by the official statements from the Treasury
Department Of the United States, it appeals riere will be
an ^appropriated balance in the Treasury, above the ordi-
