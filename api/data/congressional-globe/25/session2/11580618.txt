forty millions m the v aults, idle and unproductive, and of which
no practical u&e could be made Well a great ejection is at
handm the State of New \oik, the result of which wilt seal
the fate oí an exiting administration If the application of ten
millions of that dormant capital could save, at some future day,
aconupt Executive ñom overthryw, can it be doubted that the
ten millions would be applied to preserve it in powert Again
let us suppose ¡ ome great exigency to anse, a season oí war,
cieating beveie financial piessure andembarr ¿sement Would
not an issue of papei, foundul upon and exceeding the spec e
in the \ aults, m some such proportions as experience had de
monstrated might be safely emitted, be authorized? Finally,
the whole amount ot specie might be exhausted, and then, as
it is easier to engia* e and issue bank notes than to perform the
■unpopular office of imposing taxes and burdens, the discovery
would be made that the credit of the Government was a sum"
cient bisas wheieupon to make emissions of paper money, to
he redeemed when peace and prospenty ic urn^d Then we
fahou d have the days of continental money, and of asignáis,

Mies contending with him for the discharge of debts to private

then Governor of the colony was a man of great violence of
temper, and arbitrary in his conduct How the Sub Treasury
system of that day operated,"the same historian informa usm a
subsequent, pai toi his work * The revenue, ' he says, " esta
tabhshedthe last year, was at this session continued five yean
longer than was ougmally intended Thu  wdt> rendering the
Governor independent of the peopie For, at that day, the
Assembly had no treasure, but the amount oí all taxes went, of
course, lato the hands of the receiver general, who was appoint
ed by the Crown Out of thib fund, moneys were only issua
ble by the Governor s warrant, so that every officer in the Go
vernment, from Mr Blaithwait, who drew annually five per
cent out of the revenue, as auditor geneiaL down to the mean
est servant of the publu, became dependen! solely, of the Go
vernor And hence we find in the House, at the clo^e of every
session, humbly addressing his excellency for the tr fling wages
of their ownclerk " And, Mr President, ifthis measure should
unhappily pasb, the day may come when the Sena e of the
United States will have humbly to implore some future Pre
faideut of the United States to ¡¿rant it money fo pay the wages of
its own seigeant at aims and doorkeeper

ma I do no^ concur m that state .ent of the ca^-e There is
another course embraced in neither branch &f the Senator's a},
temaare, and thdt course is to do nothing always the wisest
when you are not certain what you ought to do Let uasuppose
that neither branch of the alternative is accepted, and that no-
thing is done what, then, would be the consequence"? There
wou'd be a restoration of the law of 1789, With all its cautious
provisions and securities, provided by the wisdom of o r ances-
tors, which has been so trampled upon by the laie and present
Administrations By that law, establish ng the Treasury De-
partment, 'he treasure of the United States is to be received,
kept, and disbursed by the Treasurer, under a bond with ampie
security, under a large penalty fixed by law, and not left, as this
bill leaves it, to the uncertain discretion of a Secretary of the
Treasury If, therefore, we were to do nothing, that law would
be revived, the Treasurer would have the custody, as he ought
to have, oi the public money, and doubtless he would make spe-
cial depositee of it m all instances with ?afe and sound State
banks as m some cases the Secretary of the Treasury is now
obliged to do Thus, we should have in operation that very
special deposite system, so much desired by some gentlemen,
b> which the public money wouid remain separate and unmixed
with the money of fe ank& 1 here is yet another course, unem
brae Jd by either branch of the alternative presented by the tse
nafor from ¡south Carolina and that is to establish a Bank of the
t; mted States, constituted accordirg to the old and approved
method of formin^suchan institution, tested and sanctioned by
experience, a Bank o^the Um pd ¡States which should bleVl pub-
lic and pi i vate m eres'e, and be suojectto public and jac^vate
control, united together in sjuch manner as to piesent s-afe T«id
«alutaiy checks asamst ah abuses The Senator mistakes his
own abardonmeii of thatm&titutnn as our* Í know that the
paity m powei ha*= baincaded i tse f against the establishment
of suen a b^nk It adopted, atf he ia.t extra session, the extra-
otdmaiy and unprecedented resolution, that the people of the
L iited States shoule not have such a bank although it might
be manifest that there was a clear n ajonty of them demanding
]* But the day may come and I truet ib not di^ ant, when the
will of the people mus, pievail in the councils of their own
Government and when ndoesarnv-3, ab?nk will he established
The ¡senator from South Carolina reminds us that we de
nounced the pet bank system, an J so we did, and so we do*
But does it therefore follow that, I ad as that s>«tem was, we
must he Juven into the acceptance oí a system infinitely worse?
He tells us that the bilí u ider consideration takes the public
fund« out of the hands of the Execu ne, and places them mthe
hands of he law It doer, no *meh <mng They are now with-
out, law, it is true ¡n the custody of the Executive, and the
bill propo&es by law to confirm them m that cusUxhjandtocon
vcy new and enormous powers of contr >i to the Executive
over them Every custodary of the puolic funds provided by
the bill is a creature of the Executive, dependent upon his
bieath anJsubjeet to he same breath for removal wbenevei
the Executive, fiom caprice from tyranry, or irmn party mo 
tivc, «hah choose to older it What ife'vi-  there for the public
money, if theieweie a hundred&ubirdnate executive officers

mstration, and persisted in by this, remains unrevoked aadun-
rebuked1
Whilst the Senator from South Carolina profr^esto he the
fuend of fetate banks,|he has attacked the whole banking sys
tern of the United States    He is then friend, he only thinks
thev   are all unconstitutional'    Why1    Because the coming
power is possessed bv the General Government, and that com
