HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,January 17, 1865.

Major Duncan,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have nothing of importance to report this morning. Two men deserted from Elliott's brigade last night. No casualties to report this morning.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

HENRY A. WISE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, January 17, 1865.

General B. Bragg,

Wilmington:

All Government cotton should be removed from Wilmington without delay, and had best be sent to Raleight. Encourage and aid, as far as can be, the removal likewise of all private cotton. It must not be allowed to fall into hades of enemy.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

SUGAR LOAF, January 17, 1865 - 8 a. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Petersburg:

The guns were ordered up, but the enemy ran several gun-boats into the river on yesterday's tide and cut off communication. We barely had time, but saved all the garrison from Fort Holmes. A longer delay at Caswell would enable the enemy not cross the river in his steamers and cut off all below Fisher, whilst we could accomplish nothing commensurate with the risk with our limited transportation over swampy roads.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

SUGAR LOAF, January 17, 1865 - 8 a. m.

Colonel J. GORGAS,

Richmond:

I only called for the guards, not the operatives, from the Fayetteville Arsenal, and will send the latter back.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
