Hon. SIMON CAMERON,

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 13, 1861.

Governor E. D. MORGAN,

Albany:

You will send on immediately the ten regiments returned by Adjutant-General Read to this Department as being mustered into service, but they are expected to come to serve three years or during the war. They may come by sea or by rail through Pennsylvania. Answer immediately.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Albany, N. Y., May 13, 1861.

Hon. SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: Applications are made to me for the discharge of volunteer militia companies that have been accepted and subsisted by the authorities of this State now in depot, for the purpose of volunteering directly to the Government of the United States, claiming that the Government of the United States will accept their services directly.

Permit me, therefore, to inquire whether, in case the authorities of the State of New York discharge such companies and they are subsequently accepted as militia by the Government of the United States, they are to form and be a part of the thirty-eight regiments which the Government of the United States is to receive from the State of New York.

If they are to be considered as part of the thirty-eight regiments, as above, their requests will not be complied with. If they are not to be so considered, upon certain conditions they will be. It is necessary to have this matter definitely understood.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

E. D. MORGAN.
