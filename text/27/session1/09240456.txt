SPEECH OF MR. SMITH,
OF  INDIANA,
In Senatei August 6, 1841—On the bi'l to distribute the pto
feeds of the sales of the public lands, and to grant preemp-
tion rights to the settlers thereon
Mr  SMITH of Indiana said   The  position, Mi   President,
which the Senate assigned to me, of chairman of the Pom mittee
on the Public Lands, would seem to impose upon me the duty
of presenting the views which I entertain of the subject matter

the ruinous and tempting ciedit system was m force    Thus
stood the land system, when,  fortunately, it began to claim
more of the public attention    The system, hy degrees   un
derwent a rad cal change    The territory acquired, as. fast as the
Indian title was extinguished, was 1 nd otfinm Corigiespiona!

tiona of SO acies each, and these into quaiter quarter sections
of 40 a< res each, bydn ect hnts crossing each other at light an
gles    The surveys were leturned to the office at Washington
and recorded, and, upon the sales at the land offices, patentó
from the Government issued to each purchaser    The price of
the public lands was leduced to one doilai and twen'y five
cents per acre, andthecash system established These ímprovt
menta in the I md system must strike every one as well calcu
lated to produce the most beneficialresults, as our experience
has amply proved to be the case    Titles are no longer doubt-
ful, the poor its well as  the rich are enabled tt provide com
foitable homes by the purchase of such quantities of the pub-
lic lands, fiom hltyactes up, as they may be able to procure
Ihe Government issues'he patent and slant's as the wariantei
of title    The purchiser improves his lands with a certainty
that the rewaul oi  his labor insecure to himself and heirs
Until of late  year*, there  were but two modes of acquiring
theselands, under the impioved sys em, by individuals—the
one was, to purchase them at the public «ales, in open competí
tion with others   at the highest bid, and the other, to enter
them after they had been thus exposed, at the fixed price of one
dollar and twenty five cents   per acre, at puvate salt     It
would seem that these modes were amply sufficient in oidmaiy
cases but the enterprising spun of our citizenb and the induce
mentheid out to diem b> the extinguishment of the Indian title
to large quantities of lands, nave b*en sufficient to impel them
onward, m advance of the settlements,   to settfi' upon and
impiove such portions of the public lands as they might select
with a view to the purchase of them at the sales, or the entry
of them at Cong roh" puce    This class of om citif^ns asked
of Congress to be secured m then impiovemenN and protected

rounding lands atan eiiher day, to a much greater amount
than she would loae by ihe difflrence between the sum of one
do'larand twenty five cents per acif, which they had to pay
fn their lands, and the price they might have to pay at public

consequently, the bill comes much nearer to a perfect eauali7a
tion than w ould appeal atfiret blush I will not detain the Senate
with any further remarks as to the details ul the bill, as it
will be taken up and explained by section^, but will proceed to
examine the objections which have been, and doubtless will
again be, urged against its passage, and in such examination.
I shall necessarily be compelled to notice the argaments in us
support
1 ne fiist objection that is urged against the measure is its
unconstitutionality It this objection is well founded it is con
elusive of the question I will therefore be excused if I devote
a shortpenod of our time, however preciousil maybe, in the
examination o' th s question of constitutionality Id ordei toa
perfect understanding of the question it may not be ímpiopet
to sive a brief history of the public lands
The Sta'es at the commencement of the Revolution were
differently situated, as to locality, the quantity of the public
domain within then íespective lion's, as well as that claimed
by them beyond those limits    Some of the States held  no
lands beyond then acknowledged boundaries, others held large
tracts    Some of the States were so located that  ihe  com
merce of the country must necessarily pass through their
ports of entry, and be subjected to the operation ofrmpo-tslevied
by them and collected at their casiom houses oiheis were de
pnvedby location of these advantages   The war of the Revoiu
tion was pal tly prosecuted under the articles of the Confedeia
lion of the States, each State bearing its equal piopoi tion, in the
ratio of its population, m ihe rommon treasure, sacrifice, and
blood nece^ary to cairy on that war regardless of the immedi
ate questions ol the difference in locality, or othei circumstances
which I have alluded to  Thi« state ol things was calculated to,
and did pioduee discontent on the part of those States that were
bearing then j ust shai e of the common charge, and who wet e to
have secured to them merely political rights, without the othei
benefits which would result to the States possessing the advan
tages to which I have referred    They contended, and not with
out much force, that as they bore a proportionable share m the
burdens of the war, they should be entitled to an equal parti
ctpation m the bcnchcial results of its tavor able close, mclud
i lg the waste and unappropriated lands thas might be wrested
from the Crown, which would be claimed by the more favored
States    These dissensions became alaimmg, the war of the
Revolution was raging the harmonious and concentrate 1 enei
gies of the States weie e&senual to the triumph of the gloiious
cause in which they weie engaged    Congress saw the situation
of affairs and appe tied to the p mioti^m of the total s claiming
theoe waste oi wild 1 nds, to íeconcilc the matter by makm 
liberal giants oi ce  ions of them for the use and common bene°
fit o fall tiit States    Ihe appeal wa« not m vain     Ihe S'ateof
New Yoik led oil, and on th* firstday of March, 1731, ceded her
waste lands to and for the "only use and benefit of such of the
S ates as are oi shall become parties io the Article* of Con
it lei tion "   I would here remaik that the e'eed of oes-, on of
the State of ISew Yoik does not ce'e the lands for the u«e
o! thf Confederation, Imt of "such of th*1 states" as are oi shall
become ¡tiembeis of that Coafedeiation, and foi ' ti eir only
ti^e and benefit"   This view wiilb  more fully pi,_ otited m
the examipat on of the deed of cess on from Vnginia, \shi '
is tht next in point of time, and is the mo&t impoi'rant in
the eonsideiation of the subject, bodi a  leeaids tíu, tine con
stt notion to be ai ven to the difleient deeds of ce sinn anl ihe ex
tent of that particular ce sion, a% it covered -what was then
called the Northwestern Terntoiy, now included m the teta es
and territory lying between the Ohio and Mi&srsbippi \ ¡veic   \ it
gima, in the year 1783, passed a law authouzmg the ccs-u n
and m 1784 the deed of cession was executed   wh ch, afei
ceding these lands to   the United   States, piuvtded that  they
' shall be considered a common fund for the use and beneíu oí
such of the I oiled States as have become or shall become mem
hers of the Oontedeiatton oi Federal alliance of the said States
ViigmianclUbive"   If will heie again be  observed that the
cessnti was n >f to the Confederation, to b^ deposed of foi the
beiKht ofthe I mted btatec bit to such oi the States as have or
anall become member* of the Confederation     It was ceitainly
not intended by this deed to   cede these l^nds to the  United
States, gen?)ally,or why weie the words ¡nsested ' Vngmia in-
ilu-ive"   If u was ííit^iiüe I to cede them unconditionally to
the Ui ited States, why not «top at thatpjmf   Virginia bem^
one ol tho^e States won d Lave been included in the general
giant to the Um*ed States    (such giant to the United Su es
wou'd urquestioiiably have included Vngimaas well as ihe
other States of the Union    It is therefore, without pushing th^
aigument submitted, that th* necessity foi maiding the, cedjn°-
i  ate by na Tie, in terms must give character to the ooject ot
the cession, and fuinish tue ti ue construe tion to be given to toe
d^cdofces mo     I is t ut to be supposed that the gtantots were
ignjiant of the import and legal construction ot  the deed oi
