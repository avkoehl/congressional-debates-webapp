FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, VA., March 13, 1865-11.30 a.m.

(Received 12.05 p.m.)

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff, Department of Washington:

COLONEL: Your telegram received. I have now 1,200 cavalry out-800 with Captain Russell to Sperryville, and about 400 with Colonel Sweitzer to Waterford. The balance of the cavalry is barely sufficient to patrol between the posts of the line, to keep up communications, and protect public property. When the cavalry now out returns the guerrillas in front and rear of the line will have a lively time of it. Nothing yet heard from Captain Russell, but I expect him here to-night. Any information received will at once be telegraphed to you.

W. GAMBLE,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
