Major General W. T. SHERMAN:

General Banks is ordered to take all his troops with him, and to turn over the defense of Red River to General Steele and the Navy. One regiment and a part have been ordered to General Steele at Little Rock, and the Thirty-fifth Wisconsin Regiment is subject to your orders.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, April 9, 1864-4.20 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN, Nashville, Tenn.:

The Thirty-fifth Wisconsin Regiment will be placed under your command, and the Adjutant-General will order it where you wish. General Grant thinks you will wish to send it to Steele. Please answer where you want it.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, April 9, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Commanding;

Dispatches of the 8th received. I wish you would give Butterfield a division.

If Hooker will address you a letter, and you indorse it, I will make other disposition of Schurz. Newton is still at Cincinnati with sore eyes, but he is subject to your assignment. There appears some trouble about Buell. I offered to take him, but General Grant does not answer my dispatch.

Make up your command to suit yourself exactly, and I will try and maintain it without change during the campaign. Butterfield is doubtless with Hooker now. Assign him at once, for he belongs to Hooker's command yet.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Will any of your plans be interfered with by so doing, or will you have them destroyed from Larkinsville down?

GEO. H. THOMAS,Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

None of my plans will be interfered with by your sending a force down the Tennessee River to destroy all boats and canoes.

A temporary draw can easily be fixed in the pontoon bridge at
