HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,October 10, 1863-7.30 p. m.

Colonel Gregg is upon his left, and pickets the country between Thoroughfare and Cedar Mountain. General Davies' brigade is on the right of General Custer and extends over to the Sperryville pike. The enemy made, at sundown, several vigorous attacks on General Custer and General Davies' position, but were each time repulsed. Two columns of the enemy were seen moving at 6.30 p. m. in the direction of General Davies' right. That is the weakest portion of my line. I have sent for Colonel Gregg. If he reports no force in the direction of Waylandsburg, I propose to relieve General Custer at James City, and have him move over and taken up position to support General Davies' right, moving a small force to picket the roads in the direction of Waylandsburg. The infantry are massed near Brown's Store.

Very respectfully,

J. KILPATRICK,
