J  COWPERTHWAIT, Cashier
This presents the negotiation, the sale, and the
payment of the thud bond, in the language and
nets of the parties, and tiom it a few inferences
tue to b'1 dt iwfi
InH Th° negotiation pioceods from the hank,
Slid not fiom fie Secietai y of the Tieasury He
does not solicit the bank to puichase, but the
bar k solicits him to •sell, and offers its teims
Second Akho i^h the proposition from the
1 ai It is before the correspondence between the
Secret try and ttie President of the Bank of Amei
leu was closed, and on tht same day on which
the agent of the foreign banking hous.es closed
the conespondence between him and the Secre
taiy, by a lettei written at Now York, yet the
Seotetniy does; not accept that proposition until
tuned ys aAer its date, and tin ee days aftei the
final close of evt ly other negotiation foi the sale
of tht lion is m th s countiy, without the least
pros; tct of success
Paid ft uas the only proposition for the
puichase of the bonds coming within the limit-
ations of the liw, which he had been able to ob-
tain, oi was likely to obtain, in this country
Fowlh The proposition was accepted as to
one bond only, although it was an offer to pur-
chase both upon the same terms, and those the
teima presented in the law
Is it possible, then, that the Secretary was de
snous of a connection with this bank, and to ben-
efit it by a sale of these bonds to it' If so, why
¿id he not mute this bank to purchase dunngthe
ten >i twelve days upon which he was so faith
fully sohcitu g offus fu m other banking institu-
tions, ai d from individuals' Why did he not
ace pt at once too proposition of this bank when
modi, on the 21st of Tuiy, and not wait till the
áJt'i and int 1 all piosppct of obtaining an offer
f oi i any ot iei quaitt r was put entirely at rest
b/ tie f-U closi of Uto separate negotiations,
I oth oi which w eie ooen, so far as his know ledge
extended, when this offer was received' Why
did he not accept the pioposmoa as to both bonds,
and thus confei upon the bank double the benefits
which were conferred, if benefits they were, by
his paitial acceptance> Until these questions aie
answeied, the chaige that the Secretary sought
this tiansaction with the bank, or sought the ad-
vantage of the bank in the sale of these bonds,
should cease to be made
But the Secretary had not heard fiom the ne
gotiations opened by him in England and Fiance
for the sale of these bonds, and how, it may be
asked, did he know that favorable piopositions
might not come from those quarters' Or why did
he not wait to be infoimed upon those points,
befoie he closed the transaction with the banR,
by the sale of the third bond ' This inquiry has
alieady been answered in the extracts read fiom
the teport of the Secretary now under considera-
tion     He says, at page 3 of the report
"In the mean time, however finding that the dem mds
for the pulhc service during the month of June had tt
eeeded $4 50Ü 00® md exp ctmg as the fact turned out to
be tint they would equil about §i 000 01)0 in July and
August and finding also that the available balance in the
treasury applicable to gtnerll purpo e , and subject to
draft, tell below^l 000 000 and that payments were mal ing
at times trt new Treasury notes, winch could not be ren
dered at a 1 available T considered it necessary to effect a
sale of at least one of the bonds at an earlier dait than ad
vices could be received, and any proceeds realized from Eu-
rope "
This is the answer of the officer himself, made
upon his ofheial responsibility, in íeply to the
inquiry above anticipated, made by the Senate"
itself What is it' That the state of the Trease
uiy would not permit him to wait for a sale of-
both of the bonds that it was, m his opinion,
" nccesiaty to effect a sale of at least one of the
bonds, at an eaihoi d ly than advices could be ic
reived, and any piocotfls lLahzed fiom Europe "
Is this answei tiue' Does ony one here doubt
it' Will anj one here attempt to impeach it'
Then the inquiry is answered and heie is the
leason why the Secretary, m July, and befoie he
had lecened leturns from his foreign conespond
cnts, accepted the offer of the bank as to one, and
not as to both bonds
These coi respondents abroad, howevei, were
heard from in due time, and what were their an
swers' That the bonds were too large, and could
not bo divided into smaller sums for the maiket,
that they had too short a time to run to make
them an object for the investment of such heavy
sums, and that their final payment was not to be
guarantied by the United States, that, for these
reasons principally, they could not be sold in
England or Fiance, within the terms of the law
I  will not trouble the Senate with reading this
correspondence It will be found among the doc
uments appended to the íeport, marked C, 1 to 5
inclusive
It is fuither complained that the Secretary of
War took a part in this negotiation with the
bank He did so, and what was it' He shall j
answer for himself, as his language upon the
subject will convey the truth more clearly, con-
cisely, and intelligibly, than any I can employ
will do it I read fiom the documents appended
to the message of the Piesidcnt of the 11th m
stant, in answer to the call made by the Sen ite
upon him for all the information upon this point,
being the report of the Secretary of Wai in íeply
to the inteirogatoiies propounded At pages 1
and 2 of the document, the Seuetaiy says
" r have the honor to state that some tune in July last,
m order to facilitate the spei dy ai d sucees lul termination
of a negotiation at that time pending between the tof eretaiy
of the treasury and Mr Macalester, I icceded to the prop   I
osition of the latter that in tie event of the sale of tin bond
being perfected, the amount af the puichase money should
be absorbed by the expenditure of this Department and the
funds to be placed by the bank at such point  and in such i
amounts as they might be requned not to exceed So00 0Ü0
a month from this source, and gave lum an as urance that '
this auangement should be carried into effect provided no I
objection were made to it by the «coietarv of the treasury   j
Mr  Macalester was accordinglv furnished with a state   .
ment, showing at what places and penous, and in what I
amounts, these funds would be wanted a c ipy of wlucnis
lierenith fui nished, milked \   This arrar genu nt vv i , on
proper explanation subsequently concurred in bv the Sec   j
rttirv of the  lieasuiv, and its details hive be i earned

II at it aided c tntially to produce tht lavorable i sue 01
the i tgotiation It lias been earned into efii a' in a man
ntr f ei ectlv satisfactory to this Department the publ c
cre< tot having been paid in such ¡unds as 1 t pre ene i to
leceive 1 think it proper to mentionth it, while Mr Macal
esternas conducing hi  correspondence with the bene
taiy of the lrca ury m April, be apphe 1 tome to know the
probable requirements of this Department for the residue of
the 5 ear, and finding that in all probability they would be
very heavy, he cxpicsscd a desire, which w i  subsequently
reiteiated by tiebuil,that the purchase of the bond 'lonlil
be negotiated by in" and the bond be tnnsfeirtd t< uV>iwj
of the War Department, to which I re| lied, is stated by
Mr Biddle in his published letter to the Secretary ot the
13th ot Vugu t, 11 it sueh an arrange mentcould not 1< ¿.ally
be made lint sub equ litlv entered into bv this Depart-
ment v, ith Mr M icalester, on which, m a great measure,
depend* d the success of the neg itiation for laising the ne
cessary funds tocanj on the operations of the Riven ment,
and which w is afteinaids sanctioned hi the bccreiaiy ot
the Treasury being both legal and advantageous to the in
terc=ts of the United States I deem it unnecessary to say-
more linn to repeat the opinion expressed bv the Secret irv
of the Treasury m his íeport on this subject that the agree
ment fin illy concluded with the binkvv i firced upm the
Government by the conditions imposed upon ihctleof the
bonds, and was entered into upon the fullest conviction
t which subsequent events h we pioved to be well gi funded)
that it wa not only ihc most advantageous which could be
made for the intere ts of the Government but presen ed at
that time in connection with the anangement for the mode
of p iving the bond due in September 1838 the only means
by which a failure to meet the pecuniary engagements of
the United States or the alternative of another call of Con
"ress by the President, could be avoided Under these cir
cum tances, and with these convictions t regarded it tobe
my duty to use my best endeavors to assist m bringing the
negotiation tor the «ale of the bond to the bank to a sue
cessful issue, especially as these funds were required to
carry on the important opertuons of this Dcpirtmerit on
which at that particular period, the peace and the charac
ter of the country so essentially depended "
From the facts here stated, we learn that the
bank, in making its propositions for anticipating
the payment of the second bond, to become due
in Stptembei, 1838, as well as to purchase the
two bonds which did not fall due till September,
1839, and 1840, kept steadily m xiew the dis-
bursements of the War Depaitment, and con-
stantly manifested the intention of makinsr the
paymentsby meetingthosedisbuisemen s. Hence
in April, when Mi Macalester was holding his
correspondence with the Secietary of the Treas-
ury, and miking his piopositions, as the agent
of the bank, foi anticipating the payments upon
the second bond, which correspondence has been
! before part oululy lefeired to, he. applied to the
Secretary of Wai, as is here s atcd, to ascer am
the requirements of that Department for the iesi-
due of the vear 1838, and, finding that they would
be large, urged that the bank bonds should be
assigned to that Department, so that the nego-
tiations of the bank might be carried on with it
Being infoimed that such an assignment could
not be legally made, the negotiation was prose
cuted to its unsuccessful termination with the
Secretary of the Tieasuiy, as has been befoie
seen On the 21st of July, and after the law had
passed foi the sale of the third and fourth bonds,
a negotiation was opened by the bank with the
Secretary of the Treasury for the sale of those
bonds, and again, as appears by the above state-
ment of the feecietaiy of War, the same appeals
weie made to him and the same desire expiessed
that the payments by the bank might be made >n
the disbursements of his Department Being con-
vinced that payments in that manner would, by-
the bank, b( made an essential condition in the
negotiation, the Secietaiy eigrcssed his willing-
ness to accept the payments as desued, piovided
such an ariangement should meet theappiooation
of t te Seciet"iy of the Tieasui y
On the 23d day of July Mi Macalester re-
opened the negotiation with the Stcntaiy of the
Tieasuiy,foi an aninjementas to the payments
upon the second bond, which negotiation vías
continued open until the 15th of Augu3t, when it
was closed, by o,n agicement that that bond should
be paid in thiee monthly installments of equal
amounts, and thatthe drafts of theTieasurei, for
the money, should be met by the bank, at the
places where they should be made payable, which
places, and the amount of diafts to be drawn
upon each, const tuted a material pait of the
treaty
if, now , we bear in mind that the same mode of
pay ment of the purchase money for the tin id bond
was the object of the collateral negotiation can ¡ed
on with trie Sccie arj of Wai, antei lor to the pur-
cl nsc of th tt bond by the bank, we shall be able
to understand the faots, without the dangei of be-
coming contused by blinding the two distinct
transactions 1 he Societal} of War tells us that,
being convinced it was necessary to a favoiaole
is t e of the pi nding negotiation for the sale of this
thud bold he entered into the stipulation to have
the proceeds of this bond devoted to the disburse-
ments of the War Department, to have the pay-
