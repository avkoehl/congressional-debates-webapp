Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA, Camp near Fredericksburg, Va., December 29, 1862.

Colonel H. B. DAVIDSON,Commanding at Staunton:

COLONEL: I have received your letter of the 24th instant. Directions will be given for the baggage of the different brigades of this army, and the men guarding it, to be recalled from Staunton as soon as possible. I also direct that Jenkins' cavalry brigade be ordered to the valley, if they can be spared from the Department of Western Virginia.

I have directed General W. E. Jones to concentrate the troops in the Valley District, and to drive the enemy, if possible, beyond the Potomac. I am glad to find that you consider our forces sufficient for the purpose. I hope the troops under General Jones, those under you and Colonel Imboden, with such other aid as can be obtained, will be able speedily to rid that section of country of the presence of the enemy, and prevent the oppression of the inhabitants which they seem to premeditate. I rely greatly upon the co-operation of yourself and Colonel Imboden.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
