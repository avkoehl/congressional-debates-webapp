In transmitting the letter I intended to inform you that in proposing the arrangement with General Huger I made no allusion whatever to the authorities at Washington. It was simply an inquiry of my own whether clothing would be forwarded to Richmond for our prisoners. The prisoners at Richmond as it wqould appear from their letters to friends are suffering very much for the want of clothing and other articles necessary to their comfort.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major - General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Camp, Gauley Mountain, W. Va., November 19, 1861.

GENERAL: * * * I have sent Captain W. F. Raynolds with a flag of truce to Floyd proposition that he should put a stop to the abhorrent practice of kidnapping unarmed citizens, and promising on that condition to release certain hostages now in [our] possession. He will be able to report where the rebels are to be found.
