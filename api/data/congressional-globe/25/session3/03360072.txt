APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[January 19,
25th Cong ...3d Sess.
Defalcation of Samuel Swartwout—Mr. Moore.
Ho. of Reps.
attend, the colonization of the indiana will be met
without a murmur That heaven mspired%enev-
olence which projected and executed the removal
of the red man to the west side of the Mississippi,
will reflect a glory apon the administrations of
Andrew Jackson and Martm Van Buren, the efful-
gence of which will continue to increase so long as
true wisdom and philanthropy shall be held in es-
teem among meri This is a measure to which all
the true friends of the red man have looked for-
ward with great solicitude This was their last
fond hope for the preservation of those native sons
ot the forest. But, sir, when the extinguishment
of Indian titles shall have been completed, and the
sword shall again return to its scabbard, or be
beaten into the plowshare, our annual expendi-
tures will at once come down to sixteen or seven-
teen millions
Mr. Chairman, during the debate upon the sub-
ject now before the House, the old tune of pro-
scription has been again revived But, sir, upon
this subject, I would not utter one word, were it
not for the mean and contemptible hypocrisy of
the Opposition upon this subject, It íeminds me
of the cry of fire from the incendiary, or the cry
of thief from the midnight robber—fiist commit
the offense, and then give the alai in with the hope
of escaping detection One aiticle in the Dem-
ocratic cieed is that, under a Government like
ours, there is no such thing as a vested right to
an office That occasional changes are productive
of great good to the country, and that whether the
"spoils belong to the victors" or not, it is the
imperious duty of every administration to sui-
round itself with trustworthy and confidential po
litical fnends This the Democratic party openly
avow to be just and right, and not only just and
proper, but just as natural as it is for the house-
holder to bring into his family cuele his personal
friends, and his personal friends only, those who
will rendei the most efficient aid in the preserva-
tion of peace and harmony around the domestic
fireside. For all this the master of the house is
held responsible. In like manner theFiesident
of the United States is held responsible for the
efficient and faithful manner in which all the af
fairs of his administration are to be executed
Who are the most likely to conduct the suboidi-
nate affairs of the Government with the most effi
ciency and fidelity, hib friends or his foes' His
reliance must be upon his political fnends, and not
his political enemies The interest, happiness,
prosperity, honor, and glory of the oountiy will,
m that case, be identified with the Chief Ma£is-
tiate and his political friends On the othei hand,
his poiiticul enemies, should they be continued m
ofhc e, might be faithless ioi the sole puipose of
bringing him and the administration into disre
pute or disgrace
Notwithstanding we avow this to be a sound
Democratic principle, yet we aie not disposed to
carry it so fully into piactice as the Federalists,
who pretend to deny any such right In proof of
this fact, 1 will call the attention of the House to
the piesent state of things in this District It is
believed that thiee fourths of the subaltern officers
and cle ks in the public offices in this city are
Federalists Look, sir, thiough the civil list
throughout the country many who aie opposed
to the Administration will be found holding office
nnder the Government 1 his was the case with
the late collector at ISew Yoik, as well as his
cashier and his assistant cashier Other cases
might be addaced to show, even in that Depart-
ment, that many are holding offices who are op
posed to the Admmistiation Cast your eye, sn ,
through the Army and the Nivy of the United
States There it will be found that a large majority
of the officers are E ederahsts, against this influ
ence, as well as against the combined influence of
all the corporate power m the several States, the
Democracy of the country has been compelled to
contend . And, sir, let gentlemen say what they
please relative to executive patronage, and exec
utive influence, through the medium of Democratic
offce holders of the General Government, except
mg so iar as that influence is connected with truth,
it hes not the weight of a feather, vhen compared
to the a'l porvadi-g influence of the corporate
money power of the country, wielded generally
by a vindictive Opposition
But, sir, for the Federalists to talk about pro-
scription, or removal from office for opinions'sake,
is to charge themselves with the basest hypocrisy
Although they pretend to deny the propriety of
such a course, and to impugn the motives of others
for carrying such a principle into practice, yet,
sir, when they happen to rise into power, upon a
delusive panic of their own creation, not a single
Democrat is permitted to remain in office so long
as that dynasty continues In proof of this fact,
I need only refer the House to the clean sweep
which was made in the State of Maine during the
past year There every Democrat who could be
reached by executive power was at once removed
from office, and it is a well known fact that such
is their practice whenever and wherever they have
the ascendency, and their moral sensibilities must
be greatly blunted for them to talk about proscrip-
tion on our part, without suffusing their cheeks
with a crimson blush
Mr Chairman, the American people are too
enlightened to receive declamation for argument,
or harsh epithets as evidence of unworthiness of
charactei Arraign any man who has uniformly
sustained a good character before the great tribu-
nal of public opinion, he may be as sure of an
honorable acquittal as that the light of day will
succeed the darkness of night, unless the allega-
tions are supported by conclusive testimony It
is upon this ground that I support the men now
m powei I have heard them charged with high
crimes and misdemeanors, but no proof has been
exhibited to substantiate those charges, and as
they agree with the great body of the American
people in the true principles of self government, I
ought to render them my cordial suppoit, and the
present Executive of the United States, as well as
all future Executives of like principles, and of like
character, will be cordially, zealously, and perse-
venngly sustained by the whole Democracy of the
country Neither they, nor their successors, have
anything to fear so long as they continue as they
have in good works
It must be admitted by every American citizen
whose mind is not perverted by prejudice, that
more has been done during the last ten years to
promote the great mercantile interests of the coun-
try, than has been done in any other like period
since the establishment of the Go vein ment Divers
compacts and arrangements, during the above-
mentioned period, have been made, which have
opened new channels of commercial enterpiise and
national prosperity During the same period, also,
the Government has demanded, and in pursuance
of such demand, has received more than ten mil
lions of money as indemnities for depredations
upon our commeice by foreign nations This
sum has not only been received, but has also been
paid out by the Government, to the several claim-
ants, without the loss of a single dollar This
shows a caie and fidelity, m conducting the finan
cialaffans of the Government, which is worthy of
all praise Furthermore, the people of the United
States may lest assured that, since the Independ
ent Treasury system has been m opeiation, the
Government has not suffeied loss to the amount of
one dollar, excepting by the defalcation of Samuel
Swartwout, a fraud which that man has been per-
petiatmgfor the last seven 01 eight years
If the Executive of the United States has been
able to accomplish such wonders without legisla
tive arc!, what may it not accomplish when that
important system shall be regulated bylaw Then
may we have a reasonable expectation that losses
will not occur for the future, but we may also ex-
pect to witness greater stability in all our com
meicial operations, and consequently experience
a much greater degree of national prosperity and
happiness than we hitherto have done
Vi 1AI CATION Or SAMUEL SWARTWOUT
REMARKS Or HON. ELI MOORE,
OF NIAV 1 ORIv,
I-j the House of Repkesi,\tativii3,
Jamxa.y 19, 1839,
On the Resolution to appoint a Committee to in
vestigate the Swartwout Defalcation
Mi   MOORE rose, and íemarked that this was
a strange state of ti ing¡>     Gentlemen on the othei
side (said he) have suddenly assumed a new and
strange position in regard to this matter But s
ieiv days ago they told us that there could be ¡ o
satisfactory investigation without a fair and impar*
tial committee A committee in which the parties
stood six to three would neither act impartially
according to their declaration, nor secure the con
fidence of the public They must, they said,
wrest from the Chair the power of choosing the
committee, for the reason that he would pact a
committee so as to suit the purposes of his friends
They desned no unfair advantage for themselves
Oh ' no, all they wanted was an impartial com-
mittee They wanted fair play, and nothing
more Well, sir, we assured them that they
should have what they asked for, and that we
were as desirous as they could be of a satisfactory
investigation How have they earned out their
professions by their acts' In the first place, we
agreed that the committee should be chosen by
the House, and, m order that the whole country
might see and know how and by whom they were
chosen, we proposed to choose them openly, and
viva voce In tins way, everything would be done
fairly, openly, and in the face of the country
But, no, gentlemen would not assent to this
They insisted that the committee must be chosen
by a seciet ballot They must be shelteied, se
creted, hidden, oi they could not give an honest
vote or make a fan choice Well, sir, they got
their secret ballot, and, according to their profes-
sions, they were then ready and enabled to select
a fan committee But what have they done'
Why, sir, they have been guilty of the very un-
fairness which they apprehended from the Chair,
if the choice were left to him They have packed
a committee upon us They will not even allow
us the three to six, which they complained was
the proportion that the Speaker allowed to them
Have they given us three members of our own
choice, men whom we would select to represent
the character and mteiests of the Admimstiation'
No, sir The Speaker, upon whom they charged
such gross partiality, allowed them three mem-
beis, who, of all others, were most acceptable to
the Opposition, and would have been selected by
the Opposition. But the gentlemen, in packing
their committee, manifest an unwillingness to al-
low a single Democratic member of our own choice
to serve upon it Not one of the members whom
they have chosen for us was voted for by a single
Democratic member on this floor In a word, the
committee is, out and out, one of their own choice,
and we have no pait in it
In order, sir, to bring this matter to a close, and
to prevent any misunderstanding, I deem it my
duty to announce in my place that no Democrat,
who is elected in opposition to the wishes of the
Democratic party on this floor, will consent to serve
on the committee, unless compelled by a vote of
the House, and, sir, any one who will voluntanly
serve on the committee, under such circumstances,
I denounce as a traitor to the party, and a conspir-
ator with the Opposition Now, sir, I propose to
the House, in order to save time, and bring this
matter to a close, that gentlemen carry their plan
a little further I propose that they select a Whig
committee, out and out Let them do that, and
we shall be satisfied We are willing that they
should take their own men, and make their own
report we will be perfectly well satisfied with such
a committee and such a report we coutt investi-
gation, and an investigation made by Whig mem
hers But gentlemen will not accede to this, and
why ' Why will they not take the whole charge
and responsibility of the investigation' Why
should they wish to give us a nominal part in it '
Is it because they apprehend that their Whig re-
port will be distrusted by the counti y' Is it so,
sir' Do they, indeed, entertain such an opinion
of their own integrity and fairness, as to doubt
whether their statements will obtain credence with
the American people ' Are they convinced, fiom
their own knowledge of the estimation in which
their frankness and magnanimity is held, that their
report, as a Whig report, wilt be received with
distrust and suspicion' What, sir ' Shall this
party, that lays claim to so much ability and in
tegnty, ay, and exclusive piety, and which is
" manifested daily in their lives and conversation,
shall this party have doubts whether their repoit
will be believed' Yes, sir, that is the case, that
is the seciet of the operations going onaroundus.
