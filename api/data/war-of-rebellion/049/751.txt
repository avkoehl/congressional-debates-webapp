rection of the major-general commanding. The Seventeenth Virginia Cavalry, Colonel W. H. French commanding, is on its way to report to you at Lewisburg, and will very probably be there before this reaches you. Orders have been given to have supplies hurried on to the Narrows, as soon as the exigencies of the service will permit. The Sixteenth Virginia Cavalry, Lieutenant Colonel W. L. Graham, is on its way to princeton. I wrote you yesterday in regard to this regiment.

Brigadier General JOHN ECHOLS,

Commanding Brigade:

GENERAL: Colonel McCausland informs me he cannot possibly forage another cavalry regiment. The Sixteenth Regiment, Lieutenant Colonel Graham, has been ordered to report to him. It is necessary, therefore, to change this dispositions somewhat, and I inclose you an order for the Sixteenth to report to you temporarily.

Please station one of your battalions at such point as you may deem best, with a view to its eing thrown either to the narrows or Lewisburg, as occasion may require, and report in regard to this matter.

Kelley is so far off he can only move on you with cavalry. The mounted force in Colonel McCausland's front has been considerably increased. Brigadier-General Duffie has reached Charleston, to take command of their cavalry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Zollicoffer:

McCausland says it is impossible for him to forage more cavalry. Have therefore ordered the Sixteenth Virginia Regiment to report to Echols also, and direted him to place a battalion so that it can easily reach the Narrows if required. Brigadier-General Duffie arrived at Charleston to take command of all the Yankee cavalry, and has 1,800 men.
