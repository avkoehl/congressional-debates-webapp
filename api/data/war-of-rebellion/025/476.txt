(Received Jackson, December 24, 1862.)

Brigadier General J. C. SULLIVAN:

After my last the rebels advanced in line of battle. Grierson, Lee, and the Jayhawkers [Seventh Kansas Cavalry] are now after them. I had but a dissolving view of them. If you have any information or any guides send out and intercept Grierson. They may get across the railroad, but I have no fear they will do mischief.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BOLIVAR, December 24, 1862.

Brigadier General J. C. SULLIVAN:

Rebels occupying a threatening position on the Bethel road. I will shell them in a few minutes; you will probably hear it.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, December 24, 1862.

General J. C. SULLIVAN:

The shelling had good effect; the rebels ran out of sight. Every point is guarded well. They cannot get at us. They cut the wire twice at Middleburg. They fired the track in fur places, but our men and a number of faithful negroes saved it. Please call Colonel Webster's attention to the damage.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BOLIVAR, December 24, 1862.

General J. C. SULLIVAN:

Glad to find line open again. After my last the whole rebel force turned back; 3,000 went direct to Middleburg and attacked the Twelfth Michigan. I immediately sent he whole body of cavalry of after them. Colonel Graves held out gallantly till past noon, when the jayhawkers arrived. I have not the result, but think all is safe. they cut the wire and sent the track on fire, but it was extinguished with little damage.

A messenger is in from Colonel Graves. The party that went above are in flight and will soon be attacked; no fears for the result, but you will not needed a regiment from here until they get through with us. We expect to fight them to-night.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General.

BOLIVAR, December 24, 1862.

Brigadier General J. C. SULLIVAN:

Better still. The Twelfth Michigan beat them off before the cavalry arrived, killing a dozen and wounding more. The rebels fled toward Saulsbury and the Jayhawkers are after them. We are about shelling those that remain in sight.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
