Fortifying the Maritime Frontier—Mr. Ruggles.

the southern, and less for the northern frontier.
The returns show only the exports to foreign
countries. There are no returns which show the
amount of our coastwise commerce. We must
arrive at that by inference and estimation. In
1S33, the exports of South Carolina amounted to
upwards of eleven million dollars. That, with a
small amount of exports coastwise, deducting
what was retained for home consumption, may
be regarded as the product of the labor of the
producing class of the population of that State.
Some allowance is to be made for what was
grown beyond the limits of that State. Maine
has a population somewhat less than South Car-
olina, but it is an active, industrious population
of freemen. It does not there take one half to
keep the other half employed. The product of
industry and enterprise in Maine cannot be less
than that of South Carolina. I have no doubt it
is greater. But the exports from Maine to foreign
countries for 1833 were short of a million dollars.
What, then, became of the residue of their pro-
ducts, making the same deduction for home con-
sumption? The answer is, it was shipped coast-
wise. The difference, then, between the commerce
of Maine and that of South Carolina is this: the
latter State shows a greater amount of exports to
foreign markets, and the former a greater amount
to ports in the United States. They ship more
to foreign countries; we ship more coastwise.
Now, I would ask, which is most entitled to
the fostering care and protection of the Govern-
ment, the commerce carried on by a State with
a foreign nation, or the commerce of the States
with one another? How would it be in time of
war? Which is the true question in reference to
our protective policy? Would a cargo of flour
shipped from Alexandria or Petersburg, be more
entitled to protection when destined for Europe,
than when shipped to Portland, Bath, or Bangor?
Would you regard as more important the safety
of a cargo of cotton, when shipped from Charles-
ton to supply the manufactories of Europe, than
when shipped for Boston or Portsmouth for the
use of the factories of Lowell or Dover? The
answer must be two to one in favor of domestic
commerce which finds a market for the products
of one State, and a resource of supplies for an-
other; and Congress is under the same constitu-
tional obligation to protect the commerce carried
on between the States, as it is to protect foreign
commerce.
Sir, there are other considerations to which t
ask the attention of Senators from the South and
Southwest. It is not difficult to show that the
whole South and Southwest are directly inter-
ested in the fortifying the northern frontier, es-
pecially the frontier of Maine; and I cannot but
marvel that & motion which goes to defeat*an
appropriation for that purpose should come from
the South. The great amount of exports from
the southern States has been adverted to. The
following is an abstract of the value of exports
of domestic produce to foreign countries, for the ,
year 1833. It is made up from the latest returns

To a very great extent you do not.

Here we see that the whole amount of the ex-
ports of the United States was $81,000,000, of
which $48,000,000 were from the four States of
Louisiana, Alabama, Georgia, and South Caro-
lina alone. To this must be added a large amount
of coastwise exports. Now let me inquire of
■owfcern Senator   by what mean   thi« vast
By this abstract it appears that the whole
amount of shipping owned in the four States
mentioned is 92,485 tons: 40,225 of the 60,903
owned in Louisiana is steamboat tonnage em-
ployed on the rivers, leaving 52,259 employed in
foreign and coastwise commerce. The perma-
nent registered tonnage is that which is engaged
in foreign commerce with but few exceptions.
Of that, these four States have but 20,215 tons,
while the whole amount of American tonnage
employed in foreign commerce is 641,091. Adopt-
ing that proportion, South Carolina should have
about 70,000 tons instead of3,000, havingupwards
of 7,000,000 of exports in American vessels. The
four States mentioned, with more than half of all
the exports of domestic produce, own less than
a thirty-fourth part of all the American tonnage
employed.
There is, then, this very great deficiency of
vessels at the South, and to supply that deficiency
she is necessarily indebted to those States which
have an excess above their exportations; the
principal of which is Maine, having over 70,000
tons of shipping engaged in foreign commerce,
with less than $1,000,000 of exports. Yes, Mr.
President, Maine, hitherto overlooked, forgotten,
and disregarded in everything relating to the
defense of her sea-board, owns nearly 40,000 tons
more shipping than all the southern Atlantic and
Gulf States south of the Potomac. Nay, I may
say she has more spacious harbors, more deep
and convenient waters, more ports of entry and
delivery, more facilities for commercial and naval
operations, than all the southern States together,
south of the Chesapeake. Sir, I do not speak
extravagantly. The facts, on examination, will
be found to bear me out.
But, sir, I will go further, and inquire where
the South obtains the vessels she owns. If I am
not much mistaken, it will appear that she is
indebted to the North for them, and to a great
extent to Maine herself. By adverting to the
abstract, I find that the four States named built
in 1833 but 1,587 tons, while Maine built 51,687.
The district of Bath alone, one of the twelve
districts into which the coast of that State is di-
vided, builds a third more than all the southern
States together, from Virginia to Louisiana in-
clusive. That one district, for the defense of
which not a dollar has been expended on any
permanent fortification, owns three times the
amount of tonnage that is owned by the whole
State of South Carolina, whose ports have been
fortified at an expense of little short of a million
dollars. The same remark may be made in ref-
erence to Portland, and the Penobscot. Our
ships—many of which are among the very best
freighting vessels in the world—navigated by
intelligent and experienced ship-masters, and
manned by hardy seamen, are found in all the
southern ports, New Orleans, Mobile, Savannah,
Charleston, &c.,&c, competing for freights and
taking their produce off their hands at the lowest
prices of transportation.
Now, air, leave the maritime frontier of Maine
without defenses, leave her harbors exposed, give
up that " peninsular State" to the enemy, and a
declaration of war would put an absolute stop to
ship-building. Her five or six hundred ship-
yards would be desolate; and the first six months
after the commencement of hostilities would see
our shipping destroyed and its owners ruined.
The effect such a state of things would produce
on southern interests dependent on the ship-
building and ship-owning States, cannot be accu-
rately estimated. The price of freights would
be greatly increased. Such a diminution of the
number of freighting vessels would destroy all
competition for freights, and southern producers
would be compelled to pay whatever northern
carriers should choose to demand. And thus is
the South directly interested in the defense of our
harbors in Maine, and in the protection and
preservation of our shipping. We do not build
ships for ourselves alone; we build them also for
the South. The ship-yards of the South are in
Maine. She is the great ship-building State of
the Union. Throughout the whole South and
Southwest every producer of a bag of cotton, a
hogshead of sugar, or any other article of export,
has a direct interest in this matter; for they will
feel the effect of the increased price of freights in
the diminution of the home value of their pro-
ducts.
Mr. President, there is one other consideration
to which I cannot forbear calling the attention of
the Senate, involving a matter of great national
interest. I have reference to the long pending,
and still unsettled controversy between tnis Gov-
ernment and that of Great Britain relative to the
disputed territory on our northeastern border.
It is a large and valuable portion of the State of
Maine, claimed, and to some extent occupied by
Great Britain, but which is clearly our rightful
domain, and should be held within our sover-
eignty and jurisdiction.
The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr. Davis]
laid before the Senate, some time since, resolu-
tions emanating from the Legislature of that State
which relate to this controversy and to the terri-
tory in question. It was at a time when I was
absent from the Senate a few days from indis-
position. I have since seen a published report
of his remarks on that occasion, in which I find
an extract published as having been read to the
Senate from the report of a committee sent by
that State some months since to explore and ex-
amine into the condition of the country in dis-
pute between the two Governments. A part of
that extract is as follows:
" The committee have thus briefly noticed the
• outline presented in its passage across this im-
' portant portion of our domain. When it shall
' be explored more fully, it will be found to con-
•  tain an inexhaustible treasure, in its deep forests,
' its rivers, and its soil. The condition of all that
' portion now held in the custody of England,
• presents matters for serious and anxious reflec-
' tion. Are we humbled by the lofty pretensions
' of a Power from whom we have twice conquered
' an honorable peace, or from what cause_ is it
' that our pride seems subdued, while our inter 
' ests are sacrificed ? No American, and especially
'no man of New England, can traverse this
' region and shut out from his mind the convic-
•  tion that «erotigs have been perpetrated under the
' cover of diplomacy, that dare not be defended in the
•  open field. This land, which we claim belongs
«to us of right, has, for some cause, or to answer
' some purposes, been most ignominiouslysurrendered
' to the custody of a foreign Power. It does not fail
«to impress one strangely, that, after possession
« of more than a quarter of a century—after the
« full exercise of sovereignty, we should quietly
« permit that possession and that sovereignty to
•pass into the hands of a foreign Power, and
' thus be held until that Power shall find leisure
< to establish over it a permanent legal title.
" But your committee will not dwell upon a
«topic so fruitful of unpleasant emotions; they
« were sufficiently harassed by them while trav-
' ersing this region; they could not look abroad
« without witnessing the depredations and waste
' everywhere committed—they could not fail to
' appreciate at its just value the guardianship ex-
« erased over it. They were not blind to the
«trespasses once ■uppreesed by our own agent ,
