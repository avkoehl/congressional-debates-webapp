GENERAL: Colonel Hartranft, of the Fifty-first Pennsylvania, has, I presume, been confirmed as brigadier-general. If his confirmation is not hazarded I would strongly urge the promotion of Colonel S. G. Griffin, of the Sixth New Hampshire, who has for the last few days been conspicuous for his bravery and gallantry.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,
