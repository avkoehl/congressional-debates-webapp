He states that parts of the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Corps are camped on the Bentonville and Goldsborough road on the southwest side of Neuse River and about three miles from that river. He says that he saw yesterday men belonging to Terry's troops, and understood that Schofield was stop and get up supplies before moving forward in force. A courier just reports that some of the enemy have crossed Moccasin Creek, moving toward Smithfield. I will soon ascertain all about it. Colonel Ashby was sent to Moccasin Creek early this morning.

He desires you to press down these roads, get as near the enemy as you can, and endeavor by scouts, &amp;c., to gain all the information of his movements possible. Endeavor to connect, by scouts or otherwise, with Law, on the river road.
