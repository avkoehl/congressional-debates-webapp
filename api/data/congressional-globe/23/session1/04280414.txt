THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.            .                  Mnj £9,
There is another bill which seems to be here
overlooked by all save the honorable gentleman at
my left, [Mr Chil-ion ] I íefer to the bill placing
the soldiers of the West upon the pension list with
those of the Revolution Mr Speaker, I may for-
get myself, but I will never forget the war worn
soldiers of the valley of the Ohio No, sir, nor
will I cease to vindicate their characters, and urge
their claims upon the nation, while I shall be hon-
ored with a seat upon this floor
Sir, my honorable friend atthe right [Mi John-
son] says his constituents desire to see him Of
this there can be no doubt All who know him
desire to see him
The gentleman says, this is the popular branch
of the Government—the last  hope of freedom
* To this sentiment I lespond most heartily     Yes,
Mr  Speaker, in this Hall, 1 have no doubt, the
last voice m defence of liberty and law will be
heard, in this Hall that eagle will make its last
flutter, that banner for the last time be unfuiled
Here shall liberty bid her last adieu    Yes, sir, in
this Hall will the last smile be dashed from the
lips of that fair goddess by some ambitious tyrant,
bursting thesedoors with swords and body-guards,
bidding the Representatives of the people depait
Heaven grant that day shall be distant—far, far
distant
Mr ANTHONY said it was difficult to bring
so many opinions togethei upon anyone time, but
the 23d was, peihaps, the safest and best period
to fix The question had now been debated four
hours, and he hoped the House was now ready for
a decision     He called foi the pievious question
The CHAIR informed the House that the main
question was the motion of Mr Clatton to re-
consider the vote refusing to fix the 30th of June
as the day of adjournment.
The previous question was seconded Ay es 106,
and the mam question ordered to be put, without
a division
The question of reconsideration was earned by
the following vote

Í he question being on fixing upon the 30th of
Jui e—
Mr J   CI   ADAMS said he would detain the
House a moment with an exp'anaHpn of his vote
From the day of themtioduction of the tesolution,
he had uniformly voted foi the shortest time    He
had presumed that the bill regulating the deposites
was not to be touched     All other important busi
ness might be despatched by the 16th     But having
found it to be the intention of the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means to bring up that
bill, which would be necessauly a subject oí dis
cussion, he was in favoi of a longer penod    If the
report of the bank committee was to be taken up,
the 30th June was the veiy shortest time for its
consideration    He hoped the House would reflect
on its character   This is new mattei    The House
had sent a committee to investigate the affairs of
the bank     Have they done it'   Not one word on
that subject is to be found in the report     It eon
tains no information as to the affairs of the bank
The committee had l eturned with a chai ge against
the bank, of having three times violated its char
ter, and for the punishment of those offences, the
committee propose to bring the offender to the
bar of the House—to bring to our bar fourteen
respetable individuals, to be punished as cinm
nals     We are to send oui Seigeant at Arms to
airest fourteen men
Mr CAMBRELENG rose to oider     He in
quired if that question was before the House
The CHAIR (Mr  Hubbard) did not consider
the gentleman out of order    *
Mi ADAMS íesumed He was assigning rea-
sons for changing his vote He hoped every vote
he should give would be given on principle, and he
felt responsible to the House and to his constitu-
ents for an alteration of his vote We are told
that we aie disposed to shrink from this subject,
by an early adjournment He was willing to stay
for years, sooner than adjourn, if he thought the
dignity of the House had been insulted, in order
that it should be sustained Was he out ofordei
when he said that he had changed his vote, be
cause of this new matter—because it was proposed
to bring fourteen men in chains to our bar, to an-
swer as criminals' We had not a soldier to enforce
our orders He recollected the anecdote of the
man who took thiee prisoneis by surrounding
them, he supposed we should send our Sergeant-
at Aims to suiround these fouiteen individuals
Pie should admue to see that sight But a grave
question arises as to the right of this House to
send into a State and arrest citizens and bring them
heie This House is not a court of justice We
are to tiy these men upon an accusation brought
by ourselves, and we are to punish them ourselves,
with the whole power of oui vindictive justice
Does any one suppose that this question is to be
settled without much deliberation'
Mi   THOMAS said, the character of the re-
marks to which he had gust listened impelled hun
to speak     Dunng his absence fiom his seat, on
anothei occasion, an act of the majority of the
committee, of which he was one, had been most
unjustly, he would not say falsely, characterized
They had been chaiged with authorizing a publi-
cation of this report, with a view of forestalling,
improperly, the public judgment    The transac-
tion he had heietofore, fianmly explained, and he
could not feel the least respect for the opinion of
any member who would theieafter impute to him
or his colleagues the slightest impropriety of mo-
tive     But what has this House witnessed fiom
anothei   quarter5    The gentleman   from   Rhode
Island [Mr  Bimcrs] had embraced every oppor
tunity, in  season   and  out  of season, to  speak
slightly of the  lepoit  of  the  bank  committee
When it was first presented to the House, and
again to day, he had sought to excite popular pie
judice against its authois and the measure they
had recommended for the adoption of the House
Notwithstanding these proceedings from that and
fiom other quarters, he had nevei attempted a vu
dication of the repoit, because he felt it did not
need much vindication against mere declamatoiy
assaults     But the gentleman fiom Massachusetts
has now entered the arena     His remaiks are too
well calculated  to forestall  the judgment of the
countiy to be passed unnoticed     The high char
acterof the honorable gentleman for distinguished
attainment, and the estimation in which his opin-
ions are held by that large poition of the people
who bel e\ e he has done signal service to his coun-
try in the important stations he has held, foioid
tha his íemarks should pass unnotirer'
Why has th s House been repeit^uly old I y
him that the dnectors of the bai it wi oni we pi
pose to attach, aie distinguished for talent", ai d
especially foi financial skill and judgment' Are
weto take it for granted that the bardi, under then
control, «judiciously anu wisely m inaged, so'cly
because they aie skiltul finarciers? Houevei mtn
may act, no one will admit that to be then pinci
pie of action The gentleman mistakes much the
character of this House and of their constituents,
if he supposes the financial skill of .the directois
would suffice of itself to satisfy them that there is
notgood cause to inquire into the manner in wh ch'
they have discharged a high trust The gentle-
man also gieatly misconceives the true character
of the House and the gen us of our institutions, if
1 e imagines that the intellectual attainments and
high character in other respects, of these person1!,
who had defied the authority of this House, would
shield them from lesponsibihty That man who
is to be deterred from discharging his duties heie,
because he may, by so doing,be compel'ed to en-
countei the disp'easure of any man or set of men,
no matterhowhigh then station, or how great their
mtel ectual powers, is unworthy to be esteemed
the represen'ative of fieemen For one, he had
a very diffeient íule for his conduct He assented
to the declaration that all men are created equal,
and he was ready to act up to the theoi y on which
our institutions are founded All men aie not only
cieated equal in the ej e of the law, but they exist
a-> equals With such rules forms guide, he would
enforce the laws against tne highest and most
poweiful,as readily as he would against the mo>t
humóle, against the Chief Magistrate of the coun-
try's cheerfully as against the most humble citi
zen Oui laws weie made by alias a rule of con-
duct for all, and they are over and above all pei
sons whatsoever Fie went foi the supremacy of
the laws, and when convinced, as he was in tins
instance, cleaily and conclusively,that an import
ant and essential principle of th e laws had been con
temned—one, without the enforcement of which
this House, the great sheet anchoi of our Govern
ment, was depuved of one of its most unpoitant
powers—h  «tood prepared to arrest or attach any
being but the diead God who made him
The gentleman has told us that the right to
attach foi contempt of the authority of th'S House
is a most mysterious power Thememoiy of the
distinguished gentleman must be nioie tieacherous
than his, and more foigetful than that of other per
sons present He had the honoi to serve with
the gentleman in the pieceding Congress Dunng
its session, Governor Houston, of Tennessee, was
anested for an assault upon Mi Stansbury, then
a member of the House No difficulty was then
felt in discovering the existence of this " myste-
rious power " Ihe resolution for the arrest of
Houston was passed by the vote of all the mem
beisof the House,exceptthirty five Theoffenee
he had committed was of a character very diffei
ent from the one now complained of Fie had
committed an assault on a member m the streets of
this city ,who wasnotengaged in the discharge of
any duty imposed on him by this House In that
case, the gentleman acted with those who had not
only the inclination, but found readily the law
which authorized them to punish for a suoposed
contempt In the present instance, it must be
admitted by all, there is less doubt, of the power ot
the House than in the case o' Houston Flere we
allege that the üneuoisof the bank have contempt
uouely disregarded the legal process of this House,
by refusing to submit to it They have resis'ed
the mandates of the House, made by a committer
duly authorized to make them It s not a con-
test between the committee and the directors We
have no personal affronts to avenge We have no
personal feelings to gratify. We were the ofEceis
of this House They oidered that to be done
which the dnec'ors will not permi* to be done
The House must then surely do one of two things
enhei back out, repeal the lesolution under uhich
the committee has been appointed, ard discharge
I the committee fiom the duty imposed, or enforce
j its will by attachment ot other compulsory pro-
I cess Gent'emen are mistaken if they suppose the
, committee feel peruliai responsibihty on this sub
i ject    Those members of the committee who voted
