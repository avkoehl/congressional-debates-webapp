this Government has unlimited control over the
actual currency of the country, whatever form it
may assume, or under whatever authority issued,
can have no difficulty in the decision of this ques-
tion. According to their conception, the Govern-
ment has a right to act on the thing itself—to pro-
hibit the circulation of the notes of the old bank, in
whosever hands they may be, and to call them in,
just in the same manner as they could any worn-
out or debased eoin, the circulation of which they
might chooss to prohibit. But we, who think dif-
ferently, must find some other ground to justify
our support of the bill. If, then, we cannot act on
the notes themselves, on what can we act1 Cer-
tainly not on the people at large, who are only sub-
ject to our jurisdiction in specified cases, of which
the present is not one It follows, if we can act at
all, it must be on those who are personally subject
to our jurisdiction, and this is precisely what the
bill proposes to do It is limited to those only who
are the trustees, or agents for winding up the con-
cerns of the late bank, and it is those, and those
only, who are subject to the penalties of the bill for
reissuing its notes. They are, pro tanto, our offi-
cers, and, to that extent, subject to our jurisdiction,
and liable to have their acts controlled, as far as
they relate to the trust or agency confided to them,
just as much so as receivers or collectors of the
revenue would be No one can deubt that we
could prohibit them from passing off any descrip-
tion of paper currency that might come into their
hands in their official character Nor is the right
less clear in reference to the persons who may be
comprehended m this bill.
Whether Mr. Biddle or others connected with
his bank are, in fact, trustees, or agents, within the
meaning of the bill, is not a question for us to de-
cide. They are not named, nor referred to by de-
scription. The bill is very properly drawn up in
general terms, so as to comprehend all cases of the
kind> and would include the banks of the District,
should Congress refuse to re-charter them. It is
left to the court and jury, to whom it properly bs-
longs, to decide, when a case comes up, whether
the party is, or is not, a trustee, or agent, and, of
course, whether he is, or is not, included in the pro-
visions of the bill If he is, he will be -subject to
its penalties, but not otherwise; and it cannot possi-
bly affect the question of the constitutionality of the
bill, whethsr Mr B lddle, and others connected
with him, are, or are not, comprehended in its pro-
visions, and subject to its penalties
It remains to be considered whether it is expe-
dient to pass the bill. This point has been discuss-
ed with such ability by the Senators who preceded
him on the same side, as to leave him bui little to
add. Congress has determined not to continue to
exercise the power of authorizing banking, and per-
mitted, accordingly, the charter of the late bank to
expire, fcut, notwithstanding, the function of bank-
ing was still continued under its name and authori-
ty, by those whose duty it was to wind up the busi-
ness of the defunct institution. The notes of the
old bank are issued as freely as if the institution
was still in existence, to the great profit of those
who have no right whatever to use them, and who
are not responsible for their redemption, and, at the
hazard of the ultimate loss of the community, and
especially of those who were stockholders in the old,
but not the present institution Such being the
facts, ihe dignity oí the Government, and a regard
to its interests, as well as that of the community,
clearly dsmand our interposition
With these impressions, he was m favor of the
passage of the bill, and never gave a vote with a
clearer conviction, both of right and expediency,
than he would give for lis passage.
THE LATE DUEL.
SPEECH OF MR. TOÜCEY,
Of Connecticut,
In the House of Representatives, Jlpril 27, 1838—
Upon the motion to postpone and print the report
of the select committee on the death of the late
Jonathan Cillet.
Mr. Speaker   The House imposed on this com-
mittee a delicate and responsible duty.   They have
19
<hscharged ltj j,aye execated the order of the
~~°u5e, and now submit the result of their labors,
•"•"ey have not been anxious to inquire who would
siand by them in this matter If it be the pleasure
°f the House to desert them, to retrace its own
steps, to rescind the resolution under which they
acted, and the various orders enjoining upon them
tne consideration of the vast multitude of memo-
nals with which they were chaiged, and to leave
them stranded on the shore, it will be no part of
lieu* duty to complain of others for instability or
mfirmity of purpose.
But when the House has ordered a duty to be
performed, and it has been performed strictly,
precisely, according to the spirit and the letter of
the instructions, without objection from any quar-
ter, with the implied knowledge and acquiescence
of all, and in exact conformity with the invariable
practice and usage of both Houses of Congress, I
do protest against the injustice of censuring those
who have only obeyed you.
What, sir, is the question'' It is whether the
report of this committee shall be suppressed—
whether all their proceedings, and the entire result
of this investigation, the evidence, and the resolu
tions, shall be thrown undei the table, for the
objection which ha  been made was, if it be valid,
presented in its true form and extent by the gentle-
man from Virginia, [Mr Robertson,] and urged
by the gentleman from Massachusetts, {Mr
Adams,] when he first addressed the House, that
the committee had no power to go into the investi-
gation at all; that when it appeared to them that
members were to be involved, thev should have
stopped, reported that fac* to the House, andshou'd
not have proceeded to take any accusatory evidence
whatever This is, beyond doubt, the rule of par-
liamentary law laid down m the Manual, which
has been so often quoted It will not be questioned
by me. It is a sound and salutary rule, and has
been the rule of this House and of the Parliament
of Great Britain from the earliest times- ''When a
committee is charged with an inquiry, if a member
prove to be involved, they cannot proceed against
him, but must make a special report to the House,
whereupon the member is heard in his place, or at
the bar, or a special authority is given to the com-
mittee to inquire concerning him "
"If a member prove to be involved;" if it turn
out tha' a member is involved, if it be brought to
light that a member is involved, the committee shall
give notice of that fact to the House, and the
House may then hear the member, or may grant
special authority to the committee to inquire con-
cerning him The object of reporting that fact to
the House, is to give notice to the House that a
question of privilege has arisen mvob mg a mem-
ber, and the object of the notice is, that the EIou e
may itself take up the subject, or may refer it to the
committee for inquiry. The rule itself, therefore,
shows that the House, whenev er it has notice that
a member is involved in a question of privilege,
may, at its discretion, refer it to a committee for
investigation
I admit, sir, m the fullest manner, that m all
cases to which this rule of parliamentary law ap-
plies, the committee have no power to proceed
They mutt stop, if I may so express myself, before
they begin, because they have no power over the
question of privilege which thus suddenly spungs
up, involving a member, but must report the fact
to the House, and obtain the authority of the House
to proceed, before they can take one step m the
investigation of that question. I deny that, in an\
case which falls within this rule, it is m the power
of a committee of Congress to proceed behind the
back of a member, and to collect a mass of accusa-
tory evidence against him, and hurl it ¡ike a thun
derbolt into this House, without the authority of the
House first fully given The rule protects any and
every member against the investigation of his con-
duct, in any manner, in any degree, by any evi-
dence, before any committee, in a case aflecting the
privileges of ihe House, without the clear authority
of the House The rights and privileges of the
House, the peace and safety of its membeis, the
public interests committed to their charge, could
not be preserved without the due enforcement of
th*s tule of parliamentary law.
The privilege of a member is not his own, it h
the privilege of the whole House. He cannot
waive it. Should he attempt to do so, he would
himself be punishable for a breach of privilege,
because it is not his own privilege, created for his
own "benefit, but a right secured for the preserva-
tion of the legislative body to which he belongs, of
the rights of the constituency represented by him,
and of the interests of the whole country, which are
more or less committed to his care. No committee,
therefore, created for any general or for any parti-
cular purpose, can takejunsdiction of this transcen-
dent right of the whole House, affecting its very or-
ganization and existence, without a clear grant of
power by the whole House. But the power may,
at any time, and on any occasion, be granted, and
whether it is granted in any particular instance, is
a question of intention and construction. If ihe
Hoase intended to grant it, and has made use of
language which will clearly confer it, there no
longer remains any question as to its existence or its
exerci«e In the present instance it was expressly
granted, in language clear, explicit, and unequi-
vocal.
The gentlemen -who havp maintained with the
greatest ability that the committee m the present
instance were restrained by this rule and have
exceeded their powers, indeed almost all, who
have addressed the House on that side of the ques
tion, especially in the earlier stages of the debate,
have abandoned, yielded, given up the whole
ground, upon which they took their stand for they
now, with here and there a solitary and strange
exception, fully admit that the whole mass of ac-
cusatory evidence was rightly taken, and properly
reported to the House They yield tip the whole
objection, and \irtually admit, either that the rnle
has no application, or has been complied with, on
the present occasion They admit that the com-
mittee had ample powers to go into this investiga-
tion, and to tal"e and report all the evidence which
which they have leportedm the present case, al-
though it directly and dfeilj involves the right and
prn liege of members o¡ this House, which could
not have been done, if that rule were applicable
Hsre, and had not been complied with
Sir, I advance three propositions, and I propose
to establish them so clearly and conclusively, that
no human intellect under the dominion of truth and
reason, shall withhold its assent, or deny that any
one of them is not well founded
la the first place, the House conferred upon this
committee of investigation full power to do pre-
cisely what they have done- and conferred the-power,
that it might be exercised
In the second place, the committee have
acted in precise conformity with every precedent
which has b'en s t from 'he foundation of the Go-
vernment to the present time
Ii the third place, the resolutions proposed are
not adjudications, but mere propositions submitted
to the House, involving inquiry by the House, and
to be adopted, rejected, or otherwise dirposed of, af-
ter a full hearing of ihe members implicated, and
m the usual mode
The Hou-e conferred upon the committee full
power. It was conferred by the resolution of the
SSth of Februaiy
"Resohed, That a committee consisting of seven
members be appented to investígate the causes
which led to the death of the Hon Jonathan'
Cillev, late a member of this House, and the cir-
cumstances conneeied therewith, and further to
mquj-e whether theie has been, in the case alluded
to, a breach of the pi.vileges of this House, and to
report thereon to the House "
Ard power was given to the committee to send
for persons and papers, and to sit during the ses-
sions of the House. The Knguage of 'hi-, resolu-
tion is exceedingly broad It con~> e> ed a special
autnonty and direction—fiist To investigate the
causes which led to the death of Mr Cilley, late a
member of the House, secondly To investigate the
c.rcomstances connected therewith, third!)- To
inquire whether there had been, m the case alluded
to, a breach of the privileges of the House and
fourthly To report on those three subjects direct j
to the House. The committee was "appointed tg
inveitigate," "fc inquire," "io report"
