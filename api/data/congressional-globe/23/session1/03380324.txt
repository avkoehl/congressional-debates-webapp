he had not pi eeisely ascertained—but having stated
its general effects) he'would cheeifully leave the
disposition of the suoject to the pleasure of the
House
Mr. CAGE said that he was as desirous as any
person could be to maintain a rigid economy in
every department of the Government, but he could
not agree that the course now pioposed by the
member fiom Ohio £Mi Vance] was the most
appropriate to effect las object It was not true
economy to cut down the salaries of individuals so
low that none but incompetent persons m.ght be
found to fill up th°se situations of trust. He con-
sidered the best mode would be íaJier to curtail
the number ot those employed, than the amount of
Mr  BARR1NGER pioposed to amend the
amendment by graduating the sums to be paid to
the officers as fol'ows, viz
The sum to be paid to the collectois, in all, not to
exceed.............................$3,000
To surveyors and inspectors.............2,500
T¿} weighers, agents, and othei   peisoiib,
not exceeding, fees included    ..........2,000
Leaving the pnnciple of fees u Houched, but put
ting limits to the amount of the salanes of these
respec ue officeis
Mr B regretted if this amendmentwould have
the effect of embairassmg the bi'l, but unless there
was a prospect of getting a selectcommitteeiaised,
to inquire imo the whole subject, that thus there
would be some pfospect of a reduction, he would
fee! comnelled to pi ess these amendments
Mr VAINCE accepted this, ard modified his
amendment accordingly
Mi OAMBRELENG assured the honorable
member fiom North Caiohna that he shou'd have
his most cordial vote, whenever such a committee
of inquiry should be proposed, oeeause he agreed
■with him, tnat the most iignl economy in the ex-
penditures of the Government was become neces-
saiy When formerly on the Committee on Com-
meice, the inequality in the salaues of vanous
depaitments was so generally acknowledged, that
'repeated calls nad been made on the Secretary of
the Treasury, for the time being, for a íepoit from
him on these salaues, with a view to having some
action on the subject, but it so happened the in-
formation had not then been presented, or m time
for the House to have it foi this purpose 'Ihe
inequality and injustice of subordinate officers
leceivtng higher salaries than those in places of
trust, was always felt, and he complained that it
was rather increased by the laU of 1832 and 1833
He would, however, lemark, that in many in-
stances where salaries weie supposed to be larger
than they ought to be—for instance, in the case of
inspectors—they were obl'ged, from the quantum
of business they had to dispose cf, to employ hands
at then own e coense to help 'hcm He would be
at all times willing to aid in having an inquny into
the salaues of custom hou^e officers, with a View
to place them on a more eqi al footirg The rrem
ber fiom Ohio, who referred to the increased ex-
pend tures m New York, should not forget hevast
amount of business that v as done there, and which
made the number of officers and the amount paid
in salaries possibly only commensurate with the
djties to be performed, and the amount of revenue
collected m that port
Mi BARRINGERremarkea.that.f bethought
theie was any hone of having i committee of in-
vestiga ion raised, he should be glad to try it, 1 e
would £ive noticeof r motion ío ts se a committee

as out of place in bills  mal; re; appropriations,
fltnough he agreed theie was  mucn inequality,
&c ,in the duties and payments to itfious < fpee s  I
'Ihe reduc ion, he admitted, was a good tiling m I
itself, but th" d irrulty was, to find a good j lace
to do a good thing, not that he complained the' e I

the same latio, make two thousand five hundred i

New York nowcoi'ected more t! an half the reve-'
nue of the country, and if therewas a comparative
statement gone into of the number employed theie,
and thenumbei employed in all the other parts ot
the United States, it v. ould be '"ound below a pro
poitionatenumbei He adverted,atsomelength,
to the great expenses to which public officers ivere
subject, to the fifling benefit the Postmastei gen-
eially enjoyed fiom the.r salaries, and contended
that a sufficient numb ! ought to be employed, so
as that then duties could be propeily performed
At a proper time he avov ed he was in favor of a
geneial system cf economy, and should be now m
favor of the proposition for the leduction of the
pay to members
Mr REED said he felt gratified in observing
that there was a geneial disjosiuon apparent in
the discussion to reduce and equalize the salaries
of all their public officei s The great inequality
that arose in them, he considered, was owing to
the system which v ascommenced of paying them
from fees. The great cuies, now absorbing the
great proportion of the business tf the country,
the fees increased theie, while they decreased so
much in the outoosts, that many of the officers
had scaicely anything to deptrd on, although it
is absolutely necessai y they should be mamtaired
at these p'a^es, cr trecountiy would bemurdated
With smugglers He vvishtd the membei f om
New Jersey [Mr Parser] would show him, how-
ever, when a good place was to be found to do
what he acknowledged Mrs a good thing Pie
had been for five \ ears looking for it Hed drot
augur any good to arise from the act on of any
committee, considering the Seci etary of the Treas
my, who had the regulation and control of these
officers, to be the most competent person to ¡epoit
then state, if not to redress the grievances felt fi om
the present system
Mi LOVE regretted he must d ffer, on this
occasion, from those wuh whom he usually felt
pleasure n voting, but he could not e,thei agree
that this was a proper bill to introduce any reduc-
tion, or that the salaries were shown to be too
large for the duties to be performed He well re-
membered what was rbrmerlj said as to the sub,ect
of refoim anu retienchment, butheconsideiedthnt
all that was said was merely pretence, and for the
objectof putting down one Administration to build
up another, li the motive for all this was, in his
opinion, bad then, it was equally bad now, and he
would not, for any oLjecf, now consent to follow a
hypocritical practice, which was al voys, to him,
objectionable He contended that the services of
good public officers were only to be at'aired by
the nation pa>mg them on a scale comment-mate
with the duties and tiustsieposed in ihem for fai'h-
ful performance, arrfJ he did not desire to have
such a cbss of orneéis employed in any depart-
ment, v no cou d rot shut one eye and keep the
other open, he wanted to have none who would
blink or wink at any iniquities The bad effects
of reducing impiopei'y the salaries cf official per-
sonages was etukingly exemplified m Kentucky,
when in a time of great paity excitement the sala
ríes to then S ate judges v as so reduced that the
admmii>tiation of just ce 1 od fallen into incompe-
tent hands, for no lawyer of any standing in his
p' ofession could be now found t > give up his emol-
uments foi the pittance afforded to the bench He
coul I not agiee that the public desired the pay of
the membeis to be ieduced,for he beieved that
there would rot beaper-on who would say tha' ti e
member voting such a leduction did so from any
other motive but the hor e to cieate effect at home
In this, membeis, 1 e thought, wi uld find them-
selves r-iis'aken Tne people knew their own
mteiest, and trey deMreo to seethen pubheo^cers
well pud lie desired to see the nequahtycom
plained of lewedied, but he cou'd not therefoie
consent to r \n  the eld rrv of retrenchment, for
re considered tie best leform would be had by
emp'o/irg good men, ai d if the cleiks did not do
enou<r" ofservue fo th  money they received, th s
cou'd be be ter remedied I y increasing 'he time at
which they should labor, tnan in ¡educing the
amount of the)   status
Mr CHiLTON dererded the motives with
which he hed cnginally introduced the resolution
foi retrenchment, alluded to by thegentleman, and
said that although no person could feel more i e<*ret
than he did at the lesult which the resolution pio 1
duced, none felt more than he did the perveited '
j use which was made of it, yet he hoped the time
1 was not now far distant when the country wou'd
have their eyes opened, as he acknowledged h>3
was, to the measuies of the Administration, who
had rode upon the cry of reform into then piesent
high places, and they would take care how their
ciedulity wou'tl be a second time practised upon.
I They would enforce upon the Governnen' the
same policy which was necessary to be observed
I by individuáis, and thus keep then  expenditure
' witl in then income, or tney could not get along
!     Mi   FILLMORE insisted that, as the measures
of the Government had the effect of raistrg the
value of morey, wh 'st,on the opposi'e bide, they
dep-eciated the means of si bsistence, it was only
actirgjustly to the people from whom these sala-
ues weie derived, to place them on a s'milar foot-
ing, in these pom s, with 'hemselves, and he con-
I  tended tnat if time dol'ars could now purchase
I those ameles wl ich formerly it would have taken
fnii to do, the salaiits of their public officers, with
■ the reduction now contemplated by the amend-
ment, would be practically as high as they had
j been.    The  objection  t.s to the time of making
I these reductions, d d not appear to him to be so
I essent ally importai t wl en the neeess'ty of do.rg
I so was so geneia'ly conceded   Pie ícu d that theie
weie propositions in the bill granting increased
compensations     If it was proper, then, in the es-
timation of the committee, thus to altei the salaries
for cfFces fixed by lav/, h° could not seethe force
of any objection to their reducing the amou"t.
fie referred  to the salaues paid  in the State of
New York as instances how mucn moie eeonom-
íce'ly the highest offices in that State were filled in
com¡ anson with thoee under the Gei e al Govern-
ment, from wh ch he infe> reel that, as these offices
were all well filled, and the appointments to them
not only not objected to, but sought for, on the
scoie of emolurnert, by the most con petei t men
m the State, one or the other of ti e rates of pay-
irg for public services may be unjust    Mr. F
referred to the fact that the judges of the Supreme
Courtm New Yorkieceive but $2,000 a year   He
desired to have a reduction now, instead of waiting
the íesult of an inquiry, for anothei reason     It
would become the interest of those whose salaries
were reduced, and which they could nevei do ¡n
any other case, to come forward a! d oppose the
< effects upon them, and in this way only could they
! expect that any inquiry could  be promoted with
any hope of a good íesult     Foi  these reasons,
I then, although he would have prefeued making
the leduction in any other shape than by the
presert appropriation,  yet, it was  cleaily their
duty that they should be made.    He would vote
for the amendment
Mi  McKINLEY had hoped that the bill wou'd
' have been got through withot t the lengthened dis-
j cussion which now seemed somevitable   Itseem^d
i to him thft the great object which honorable mem-
bers aimed at—¡eduction in the salaries of ihe
officers—could not be effected in the way which
they proposed     The offices  themselves having
been fixed by law wi h certain salaries, they could
not be reduced withjut repealing the law which
cieated them     He "f>id that if the people weie to
be relieved, it must be by a reduction of the taxes
Would the reduction of salaues effect tr at object ?
