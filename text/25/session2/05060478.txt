A message was received from the House of Re-

a joint resolution fixing the day of adj uirmnent of
the present session of Ci'ngiess being the Dili of
July next, and
On notion of Mr CLAY of Kentucky, it was
postponed to, and made the order of the day for to-
morrow
On motion of Mr WRIGHT,
Resolved, That the Committee en Finance be m-
s'ructed to inquire into the expediency of allowing
equitable commissions to the agents or attorneys of
persons to whom allowances have been made un-
der treaties of indemnity wnh foreign nations,
when, in consequence of an indebtedness to the
United States on the part of the claimant, the mo
ney has been retained by the Government, and the
agent, as attorney of the claimant, has not been
paid tor his services in prosecuting the ehim be-
fore the commission
Mr CLA1 rose for the purpo e of calling the
attention the Scnaie to a resolution ( flered by Mi
HuBEJiui and .igreed to bj the f> *att «omt daj s
ago, iequtiiii¿ that the original papéis on pin ate
claims should not be withdrawn iiom the files of
the Senate, but allowing copies of them to be pro-
cured by the claimants on p ivi g such compensa-
tion as is allowed foi similar su vices in the State
Department of the Government Mi C argued
that the portion of the res ihition anihon/ ng pay
for copies of the papers was tit coHsttttitio i*I, inas-
much as it was in the natmeof a tax, which the
Senate had not the constitutional power to ongi-
nate, and much less to lay, without the concui-
rence of the other House Mr C therefore moved
to reicmd that portion of the resolution, including
also that pait whi"h allowed copits lo be ob ained
by ihe claimants
Mr HUBBARD had not examined  nh eulieal
precision the constitutional!!) of the mil er All
the object he had in view was the fuilher^nce of
justice to individuals, and the secur iy of th= United
States The experience wh ch every Senator had
in re'aüon to the claims made by individuals iiust
convince the Senate of the propriety of adopting
some such measure He had no great objection,
if the Senate saw fit, to have copie* of Ihe pipers
given to the individuals at the evpense of the
United States
Mr DAVIS thought he saw great propriety in
retaining the original papers on the files of the
senate It «as due, as the Senator from New
Hampshire had very j jsil) obser/ed, tor the scour (y
of the Government lie d d not vj«w it v llw
same light as the Senator from tierlucVy, w i
tax, but as a mere office rtgu itioo He was
j-eisuaded, fiom what Utile experience be had, that
the Government had already been subjeoted to
losses, by tne habit which claimants had got into
of withdrawing their papers.
Mr CLAY still denied the power of the Senate
to enforce such a rule without it was done by the
concurrent legislation of both houses    He there-
fore hoped the rule would be rescinded, at least
so far as related to the charge imposed
Mr. KING said great injury would be likely to
result to the Government from the withdrawing of
the papers of individual claimants. Theie were
cases on which all the testimony of which reports
were founded, were no longei to be found on the
files of the office. The papeii were withdrawn,
and the cases gradually improved, (for ten or fif-
teen years, in some instances,) until all the origi-
nal evidence was lost sight oí Mr K said he
was glad to find the Senator from Kentucky had
suddenly become so strict a constructionist He,
[Mr IC ] however, did not look on the subject in
the light of a tax The clau=e of the Constitution
on which the Senator relied to sustain him, did not
bear him out Mr. K expressed a wish that the
section might be retained
Mr. SEVIER hoped the Senator ftom Kentucky
would move to strike out the whole of tbo sectiou,
and if that Senator would not do so, he [ .li. S ]
would. Mr. S. thought the íeports, which were
always in cases of any importance, were sufficient
evidence at least for landmarks to guide them in
their researches. Jf individuals chose to withdraw
their papers, let them do so
Mr HUBBARD said he would ask the j.eas
and nays on the question He siw no pi-
jury likely to result, and was satisfied it wouid
be attended with much good As to the rop >rt
which had been referred to by the Senptorfrom
Alabama, there were some case where there « a
no evidence to sustain the written reports
