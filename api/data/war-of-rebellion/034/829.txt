Somerset, with Colonel Sanders in close pursuit. A great many arms, horses, and over 300 prisoners have been captured, among them Colonel [H. M.] Ashby. They came into Kentucky to make a diversion in favor of Morgan, and will probably be much damaged before getting out.

Numbers 2. Reports of Major General George L. Hartsuff, U. S. Army.

LEXINGTON, KY., July 28, 1863-1.15 p. m.

GENERAL: No news from the enemy yet. About three hours ago the line to Mount Sterling ceased working. A party is out in direction of Winchester to ascertain cause. Horses are shod, rations issued, and the cavalry and battery start within an hour, under Sanders. He is directed to take every measure possible to kill or capture enemy, and, at all events, to drive him completely out of the State. He will be in Richmond to-night. He is directed to take every precaution that the enemy does not pass him in the Winchester and Mount Sterling direction. If he should go in direction of Camp Nelson or Nicholasville, his destruction is certain. I notified you that I had directed arming of the Twentieth Kentucky, and its return to duty. There is a great deal of feeling about it. Will you immediately issue order declaring their paroles to be null and void, with reasons, and a tribute to the gallantry of the regiment? It is needed. I am convincing Colonel Hanson now of the justice and necessity of the order.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE.

LEXINGTON, July 28, 1863-9.50 p. m.

GENERAL: Am making all the concentration possible to-night, and will move against the enemy to-morrow with what force I have. Colonel Byrd has arrived at Camp Nelson. I have directed all troops to report to General Fry soon as they arrive, and asked him to arm the Twentieth Kentucky and put it on duty. Have ordered away all the mounted troops except Gilbert's. No news from the enemy. I think we will whip him to-morrow if he remains.

GEO. L. HARTSUFF,

Major-General.

General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE.

LEXINGTON, [JULY 28, 1863.]

GENERAL: A force of the enemy, about 1,000 to 1,500 is approaching apparently from Williamsburg and Somerset. Gilbert is watching it closely; his outpost at London is falling slowly back before them.
