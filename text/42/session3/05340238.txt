THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 17,
lie Lands reported the bill at the last session
and I can see 110 reason why it should not
la'lhe VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Louisiana asks unanimous consent that
the Senate consider at the present time a bill
which was passed over when the Calendar was
under consideration some days since.
Mr. SHERMAN. If a single objection will
put it oyer, I do object, for the benefit of claim-
ants.
The VICE PRESIDENT. A single objec-
tion is sufficient, and the bill will be passed
over.

JOHN B. CHAPMAN.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The 8eeretary
will report the first bill on the Calendar, under
the rule for the passage of unobjected bills,
known as the "Anthony rule," until one
o' clock.
The Chief Clerk read the first bill on the
Calendar, which was the bill (S. No. 1022)
relating to the claim of John B. Chapman.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It requires the Commissioner
of Indian Affairs to investigate the claim of
John B. Chapman against the Osage nation
of Indian*, and report what, if anything, is
justly due the claimant from the Indians or
the Government, and if anything, how much.
The bill was reported by the Committee on
Indian Affairs, with an amendment to insert
the words " to Congress," after " report," in
line five.
The amendment was agreed to.

(S. No. 1114) to repeal section fourteen of an

other purposes."
Mr. HARLAN- Has that bill been to a
committee?
The VICE PRESIDENT. It has not been
referred to any committee.
Mr. HARLAN. I think it ought to be
examined by the Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mr. NYE. I would rather it should lie
over.
Mr. HARLAN. I have no objection to
that. ,t
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will
be passed over, retaining its place on the
Calendar.
INDUSTRIAL 'TRAINING ASSOCIATION.
The next bill on the Calendar was the bill
(S. No. 9o-j) incorporating the National Sol-
diers and Sailors' Orphan Industrial Training
Association ; which was read.
Mr. EDMUNDS. That bill evidently will
need to be considered on the question of the
power of Congress, however useful this object
may be, to provide corporations which shall
have functions in the various States. I doubt
very much whether we can do that.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill will be
passed over.
JOHN S. CORLETT
Mr. WRIGHT. During my absence on the
12th of this month, I find, a report was made
by the Committee on Pensions, in the case of

that the bill (II. li. No. 855) granting a pen
sioa to him be indefinitely postponed. 1 ask
unanimous consent that that bill may go on
the Calendar 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Iowa asks that House bill No. 855, which was
indefinitely postponed on the report of the
Committee on Pensions, may be placed on the

objection? The Chair hears none, and it is so
ordered. i

Mr. EDMUNDS. I see that the Senator
from Illinois is not in his seat, and I do not
remember the circumstances of that bill. I
think it had better be recommitted for further

money.

objection the bill with the amendment will
be recommitted to the Committee on the
Judiciary, and it is so ordered.

The Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads, to

1 That by a communication from the Auditor 01 the

for carrying the mails on route No. 6150, in the State

established by sufficient evidence. Therefore your
committee respectfully recommend that said reliet
be granted by the passage of the aforesaid bill/which
provides for the payment to said contractor, Hollis,
of the amount stated as remaining his due.
Mr. HILL. I merely wish to remark to the
Senate in regard to this little bill, in addition
to the facts set forth by the committee, all of
which came within my personal knowledge,
that the old gentleman in whose behalf this
bill is proposed lived in the same town with
myself, and has done so for thirty years and

hope it will be passed.
