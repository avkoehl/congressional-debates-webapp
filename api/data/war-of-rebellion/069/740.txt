have thus far obtained is hardly fit to drink. The great increase in the number of prisoners and the increase in the garrison have so lowered the wells that Captain Hawes, senior officer of the Potomac Flotilla at this station, to-day requested me to run a boat daily to Baltimore for the purpose of supplying, his vessel with water.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 10, 1864. (Received 9.20 a.m. 11th.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

All 	quiet along our lines. Yesterday General Kautz charged enemy's works at Petersburg, and carried them penetrating the town, but not being supported by General Gillmore, who had withdrawn his forces without a conflict, General Kautz was obliged to withdraw without further effect. General Kautz captured 40 prisoners and 1 piece of artillery, which he brought away with him. It is a misfortune that General, Gillmore did not support him. Might I not have the Thirty-sixth U. S. Colored Regiment from Point Lookout? Three regiments ought to hold the prisoners there.
