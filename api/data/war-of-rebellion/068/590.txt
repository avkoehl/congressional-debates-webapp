HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, In the Field, May 9, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

My three brigades are closed up on the right of the Eighteenth Corps. Ames has been deployed, but now awaits Weitzel's advance to form on his right. I sent you the boy that brought the information forwarded to you by Lieutenant-Colonel Smith. Your dispatches to me must have miscarried, for I have received no order for over two hours.

Yours, &amp;c.,Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, In the Field, May 9, 1864-3.25 p.m.

Do you desire me to extend my command, or any portion of it, on the right of the Eighteenth Corps, or have you any orders to give?

The men are well rested now.

Very respectfully,

Q. A. GILLMORE,

HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, In the Field, May 9, 1864-8 p.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

I inclose dispatches* just received from Colonel Voris, commanding one of the regiments left on our right this morning. I have had additional consultation with General Smith in regard to withdrawing within the intrenchments. We think it should be done by all means as there is nothing to gain here but what can be secured with more certainty by the plan suggested in the dispatch sent in by General Devens.

Q. A. GILLMORE,Major-General, Commanding.
