the enemy failed to obtain supplies from the country. In the mean time (on the 11th of February) intelligence was received from Forrest that the cavalry of the enemy was advancing, under Grierson, from Memphis, evidently intending to effect a junction with Sherman at or near Meridian. Lee and Forrest were ordered to co-operate in meeting and driving back this column, and succeeded in doing so, when Sherman, perceiving ultimate objects of his movement were unattainable, commenced falling back, pursued and harassed to the MISSISSIPPI by Lee's cavalry. These movements of our forces, however, although eminently successful in defeating the gigantic plan of campaign of the enemy, had rendered it necessary to recommence the organization for bringing some system and order out of the chaotic condition of things in the department, and have left the troops posted as follows: The infantry of Loring, consisting of 4,259 infantry and four batteries of artillery is concentrated around Montevallo. I found it in a condition of high efficiency in every particular, well armed, highly disciplined, and thorough in knowledge of the drill; one brigade, that of Colonel Scott, is more perfect in maneuvering than any I have ever seen, and, in this connection I beg leave respectfully to forward a letter in his behalf from Major-General Loring. The artillery accouterments and horses were in perfect condition. I inclose consolidated reports of the DIVISION. * The brigade of General Sears is at Selma en route to join French; I inspected it and found it in good order; I inclose report from his brigade of effective strength. # I found Major-General French's DIVISION at Tuscaloosa; it is small, but the troops were well drilled. The Missouri brigade well armed, equipped, and drilled. The Texas brigade of Brigadier-General Ector was poorly armed and not well clothed, but still presented a most soldierly appearance. I have not yet received report from French's DIVISION, but will forward it when it reaches me. I found also Lee's cavalry scattered by brigades around Tuscaloosa for the purpose of obtaining forage; they presented a very favorable appearance. I inclose reports of Ross' brigade## and Armstrong's brigade@; Ferguson's not yet in. I arranged with General Lee that as he was about to move toward Columbus, and as Forrest was falling back toward Okolona, I would on the 8th or 9th of this month meet him in that vicinity and inspect again thoroughly all the cavalry he could concentrate, by which time I hope to be able to forward full returns both from him and Forrest of their strength. Should we not be able to concentrate it, I shall, in compliance with your instructions to obtain full reports of brigades, visit and inspect each portion of the force wherever it may be.

I regret that I have been unable to obtain rosters of the officers as directed. General Maury promised me they should meet me at Demopolis, but I have as yet been unable to get them. I shall go to Meridian by way of Mobile to make another effort. Lieutenant- General Polk is awaiting the arrival of Forrest to have a complete roster made out of his department. I inclose an approximate return from General Polk's assistant adjutant-general, with various exhibits filed by the general relating to operations referred to hereafter. // From the commencement
