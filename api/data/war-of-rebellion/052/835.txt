The general commanding directs that you proceed at once with the forces with which you have been operating in the Sequatchie Valley and report to the commanding officer at Bridgeport for scouting duty along the river below that place.

Leave one company at Tracy City, unless you can find Captain Brixey, who commands a company of independent scouts. If you find him, order him to protect that place, and then take your whole force with you.
