Mr. PERHAM. The gentleman may not
be aware that under the provisions of the gen-
eral law a person who has lost an arm or a
foot in the service is entitled to a pension of
fifteen dollars per month, and the same sum
is allowed where the disability is equivalent to
that. One of these cases is that of a person
who lost an arm in the service, and the amount
of pension is fixed by the law. In another of
these cases the committee did not feel justified
in deciding the extent of the injury, and con-
cluded to leave the matter with the Pension
Office, where a proper examination may be
made and the case settled according to the
provisions of the pension law.
Mr. DAVIS. I simply desired information
in reference to the matter.
The bill was ordered to a third reading, read

Mr. DAVIS. I desire to ask the chairman
upon what principle he reports the pension
given to the mother of the child shall only
continue during her widowhood? It seems to
me she should be entitled during her natural
life. I see no reason why it should be confined
to her widowhood.

House is a law to itself if the Senate concurs.
