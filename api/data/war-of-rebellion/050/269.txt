A. J. MACKAY,

Lieutenant Colonel and Quartermaster, Fourteenth Army Corps.

Numbers 18.

Reports of Brig. General Absalom Baird, U. S. Army, commanding First Division, with complimentary orders of General Rosecrans.

HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Chattanooga, Tenn., September [25], 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this division from the 2nd of September, when we moved from our camp on Crow Creek to cross the Tennessee River, to the 22nd, when we reached this place. The reports of battles are made separate and in detail.

I marched from the point above named on the 2nd instant, and concentrated my force near Bridgeport, but was unable, from the great accumulation of materiel, troops, and trains, as well as the frequent breaking of the bridge, to pass the river until the 4th. I then crossed without an accident or moment of delay, occupying the day in so doing, and encamped at night near the south end of the bridge.

Upon the 5th I moved up to Moore's Spring, at the foot of Sand
