OFFICE COMMISSIONER FOR EXCHANGE,

Fort Monroe, Va., September 10, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded to Major General E. A. Hitchcock, Commissioner of Exchange, Washington, D. C.

S. A. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General and Commissioner for Exchange.

RICHMOND, August 28, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I confess that I was very much disappointed in not receiving one word from you by the present boat in relation to the proposition I made to you at our late interview, respecting paroles; nor did you say when you could be at City Point to give an answer.

I received no answer to my communication in relation to the release of surgeons. I beg that you will return an answer as to these matters in your next communication.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, VA., August 28, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Some time ago I addressed a communication to you asking why you held General Morgan in close confinement and what was its nature. To that I have received no reply. In that I am not disappointed, as it is not the habit of the Federal agent of exchange to answer inquiries. Since them I have seen in your papers detailed accounts of the treatment General Morgan and his brother officers have received. What does this mean? It is alleged that this course is pursued in retaliation for the confinement at Colonel Streight and his officers.

I have already assured you that those officers are treated exactly as all others held in confinement at the Libby. Colonel Streight has expressed to me in person his satisfaction as to the manner in which he was treated. Do you wish him shaved and put in a felon's cell? If you do you are pursuing exactly the course to effect it. May I again ask why you have put General Morgan and his brother officers in a penitentiary?

I have but faint hopes of getting any reply, but under the circumstances I have ventured the question.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, August 28, 1863.

Brigadier General S. A. MEREDITH, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I still adhere to my declaration of the 20th instant in respect to the release of non-combatants. To that and almost every other communication involving a principle you have not replied. Fairness
