REPORT;-i or COMMITTEES.
Mr. CRAGIN. The Committee on Terri-
tories, to whom was referred the bill (H. R.
No. 1089) in aid of the execution of the laws
in the Territory of Utah, and for other pur-
poses, have had the same under consideration,
and instructed me to report it back with sev-
eral amendments, and recommend its passage.
I move that this bill be made the special order
for next Monday.
Mr. POMEROY. 1 hope we shall not make
any more special orders. We have tried to
get to the Calendar; but as long as there are
special orders they are first iu order, and we
never shall proceed with the Calendar so long
as there are special orders to take precedence
of it. .This Utah bill may be a very good bill
as amended ; but it was a very bad one, I think,
as it was passed by the House of Representa-
tives.
Mr. CRAGIN. There is a difference of
opinion on that point.
The VICE PRESIDENT. This is a report
of a committee, and objection being made to
it, it cannot be considered iu any aspect during
this day.
Mr. PRATT. The Committee on Pensions,
to whom was referred the petition of Joseph
M. Buckland, a soldier of the war of 1812,
who was allowed a pension in 1826, and who
now prays for arrears of pension, have directed
me to submit a written report adverse to his
claim.
The committee was discharged from the
further consideration of the petition, and the
report was ordered to be printed.
Mr. SAWYER, from the Committee on
Appropriations, to whom was referred the bill
(S. No. 99) to pay loyal citizens in the States
lately in rebellion for services in taking the
United States census of 1860, reported it with-
out amendment.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine, from the Com-
mittee on Appropriations, to whom was referred
the bill (IT. Jt. No. 1596) for the relief of the
Sisters of our Lady of Mercy, of Charleston,
South Carolina, asked to be discharged' from
its further consideration, and that it be referred
to the Committee on Military Affairs; which
was agreed to.
Mr. BUCKINGHAM, from the Committee
on Indian Affairs, to whom was referred the
petition of William J. Larimsr, praying com-
pensation. for property taken from him by In-
dians in J uly, 1801, asked to be discharged from
its further consideration; which was agreed to.
Mr. DAVIS. The Committee on Indian
Affairs, to whom were referred a memorial of
certain citizens of Johnson county, Kansas, and
also a memorial of certain members of the
Black Bob tribe of Shawnee Indians, have in-
structed mc to submit a report, accompanied
by a joint resolution, the passage of which they
recommend.
The joint resolution (S. R. No. 173) in rela-
tion to the sale of the lands of the Black Bob
Indians in Kansas was read, and passed to a
second reading, and the report was ordered
to be printed.
BILL INTRODUCED.
Mr. PRATT asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
780) for the relief of James E. Young ; which
was read twice by its title, referred to the Com-
mittee on Claims, and ordered to be printed.
INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. RAMSEY submitted an amendment in-
tended to be offered to the bill (II. R. No. 1169)
makingappropriations for the current and con-
tingent expenses of the Indian department,
and for fulfilling treaty stipulations, so called,
with various Indian tribes, for the year ending
June 30, 1871, and for other purposes; which
was referred to the Committee on Appropria-
tions, and ordered to be printed.
WASHINGTON CITY CANAL.
Mr. THURMAN. I offer the following
resolution and askforits presentconsideration:
Resolved, That the Committeo on tlio District of
Columbia bo instructed to inquire into the expe-
diency of causing a main covered sewer to bo con-
structed in the abandoned canal in Washington city
for the drainage of said city, and filling up all of
said canal that shall not be occupied by such sewer.
That canal, as everybody knows, is the great-
est nuisance that exists, perhaps, in any city in
the United States. It was made by the Gov-
ernment, abandoned by the Government, and,
in my judgment, the Government ought to fill
it up and provide for a main sewer in it, as
could be done without any extraordinary ex-
pense. The resolution is merely one of inquiry,
and I hope it will be adopted.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
JOINT INDIAN COMMITTEE.
Mr. DRAKE. I rise to ask the unanimous
consent of the Senate to pass a bill granting a
charter to the American Union Academy of
Literature, Science, and Art in this District,
which has been favorably reported upon by the
Committee on the District of Columbia. It is
merely a literary and scientific institution.
