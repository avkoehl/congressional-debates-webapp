signed to the division at this time. Though Corse`s may not be expected immediately, he hopes that ere long it will be enabled to rejoin its division.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, June 29, 1863.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Dublin:

Have you received General Lee`s letter in regard to movements by you? Had you any other plan, or do other operations suggest themselves to you? Reply by mail, and state strength and position of your forces, and to what extent, under existing circumstances, they may be removed for duty elsewhere.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

JUNE 29, 1863.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

General D. H. Hill having come over from Petersburg, whence nearly all of his troops have been withdrawn for the defense of this city, applies for leave to command here. As the forces consist mainly of troops from his department, this seems to me reasonable, and you will issue an order giving him temporary command of the troops in the field for the defense of Richmond.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

DR. WILLIAMS` PLACE, Near Richmond, June 30, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, C. S. A.:

The order assigning me to command has not been issued.

General Wise tells me that the heavy batteries are in bad condition, magazines damp, tubes imperfect, &amp;c. I wish to send an inspecting officer to-day. I am not satisfied, moreover, as to the condition of the picket lines on the left.

A definite assignment is necessary to insure something like organization in the command.

With great respect,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

JUNE 30, 1863.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL.

Let the assignment to field service be made as understood in conference this morning.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary.
