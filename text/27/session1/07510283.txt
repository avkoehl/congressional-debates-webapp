true value, and the friends of the paper system
raised a clamor against Geneial Jackson for debas-
ing the coin.
Another argument -n favor of a national bank is,
that there is not com enough in the country to fur-
nish a sufficient circulation Mr Webster m 1832
was chairman of the Finance Committee of the
Senate, and made a report to that boctv, which in-
dicated the total amount of gold and silver currency
then in circulation. By this report, it appeared
that there were twenty millions in the country in.
1832, but by another official report, made to Con-
gress in 1838, it appeared that the amount of gold
and silvei then in the country was over eighty
millions, and there is now upwards of one hundred
millions Sir, I would ask the chairman oí the
Select Committee on Currency, (Mr Sfrgeant,)
how did this amount of gold and silvei get here '
It did not come here by the operation of the laws of
trade, for the balances were then against the coun-
try. We have a sufficient amount of gold and sil-
ver in the country to answei all the purposes ot
trade, and it will remain here, (the gold bill hav-
ing naturalized it in the country,) unless you pass
this bill, and that will banish it lrom the country
While we have a plentiful supply of the precious
metals, it will give solidity to the currency, and
stability to trade and commerce And when the
insolvent banking institutions of the States shall
cease to exist, and the solvent ones shall be propeily
regulated and restricted by the action of public
sentiment operating upon thenWhrough their res
pective Legislatures, and are malte to perform their
high duties to the people, m furnishing a currency
always convertible into gold and silver, then tiade
and commerce will revive, the decay of public
virtue will be arrested, industry, frugality, and
economy will once more exist in the land, and we
shall move lorward in progressive advancement to
become what Providence designed,us to be—a great,
properous, and happy people    j*
Mr Chairman, I now piss to another bianchof
the subject I deny that a bank is necessary to aid
the Government in the collection and disbursement
of the pubhe revenue I affirm that it can be col-
lected and disbursed to the public creditor without
the aid of a bank, State or national Experience
is a lamp which should guide our path It has
been the misfortune of the Government to have
been connected with banks, either State or national,
lrom the establishment of the first Bank of the Uni-
ted States down to the eommencemetó of Mr Van
Buren's administration Betore thsElst bank", the
revenues were collected in gold sp silver the
currency of the constitution, and promptly paid to
the public creditor. The financial sjstem first
adopted under the constitution operated well There
was no complaint. The Government had no diffi-
culties to contend with, in relation to its fiscal opera-
tions But recently wc have had a more substan-
tial experience oí the benefits resulting from tne
collection, custody, and disbursement of our own
money The administration of Mr. Van Buren
has established the problem in the practical opera-
tion of the Government,—that the revenues can be
collected and disbursed without the aid oí banks,
either State or national. This will require a short
examination of the financial condition of the Gov-
ernment when Mr Van Buren came into pow er,
and the operating causes which p oduced the great
financial measuie of his administration And I
trust I shall not be called to ordei it 1 s'-ould devi-
ate somewhat from the strict line of debate Mr
Van Buren came into power on the 4th of March,
1837 The surplus revenue in the Treasury on the
1st of January, 1837, was estimated at fortv three
millions ot dollars Sir, it was not m the Treasu
ly, nor was it in the deposite banks it had been
loaned out to speculator -, and invested m nee and
cotton lands of Alabama and Mississippi, in the
timber lands oí the east, in paper cities, and m the
beautiful piaines of Wiskonsm and Iowa Well,
sir, after reserving five millions, the balance passed,
undei the distribution law, to the States At the
short session which terminated when Mr Van
Buren came into power, Coneiess passed appropna
tions amounting to thirty-seven millions—exceed-
ing the estimates of the departments nineteen mil
lions Mr Secretary Woodbury, m his annual
report to Congress, with a far reaching sagacity,
had anticipated a probable falling off of the revenue
tor the current year, but Congress supposed that
the paper millemuin had come, and that the receipts
durin<* the year, fiom customs and lands, would be
sufficient to meet these immense appropriations
Fiscal Han't—Mr. McClellan.
Mr. Van Buren, therefore, commenced his admin-
istration with a plundered Tieasuiy—plundered
by the distribution bill, and by appropi íations to the
amount of thirty seven millions, to be paid from
the current revenues during the first j tar of his
administration The Secretary of the Treasury
commenced receiving the public revenue and dis-
bursing it to the public cieditors,—
"All went meiry as the mainagebell,"—
until the memorable 10th of May, 1837, when' an
earthquake was felt m all the land The banks
suspended specie payments The suspension com-
menced wnh the deposite banks in the city of New
York, which held the federal rev enue , and, with
the rapidity with which steam power could spread
the intelligence, bank after bank suspended, until
nine hundred banks came down upon the country
in one mighty avalanche of rum Spei ulation and
over-action contributed, but the momentum which
put the ball of suspension m motion was the distri
bution bill It was the match that fired the whole
train of banks, and blew up the fmancesof the Gov-
ernment and the trading community What was
the effect of the suspension upon the finances of the
Government'! The deposite banks were indebted
to the Government twelve millions of dollars, and,
by reason of the suspension, they could not pay the
Governmenta single dollar for Us otdinaiy expen-
ditures The importing merchants wcie indebted
to the Government four millions moie upon duty-
bonds , and they could not pav, beciuse of the sus-
pension Th Government was left with sixteen
millions of unavailable íesoutccs, \vh le the fourth
instalment to the States, and the balance oí the
thirty seven millions of appropriations, temamed
to be disbnised What was to be donet Was the
late President to permit the filth of the Govern-
ment to become violii.ed'í No, su, no He as-
sembled, the peoples rtrlesentatncs around the
council fires of the nation 'oiemedythi evils that
had Detallen the couutiv and rccoinmndcd that
indulgence should be given to the meichints, hj an
extension of time upon then duty bonds, and that
the banks should be allowed to pay the amounts
due from them by instalments and at a liberal credit
And, to provide temporarily for the current expenses
ot the Government, he recommended an issue of
ten millions of Treasury notes, m anticipation of
the futuíe íesourccs of the Government fiom the
banks and the merchants by instalments These
Treasurj notes operated in favoi ot the banks and
the merchants, leaving; theru in possession of their
means and enabling them to avoid pressing their
debtols, anil working like levéis to raise the banks
to lesuvnption And yet the civ went from the sea-
board to the Roeky Mountains, that the late Piesi-
dent proposed no measuies oí relief to the people
The law of June, 183fi, legulitinsr the public de-
posites, prohibited the Secretary of the .Treasury
from receiving in payment of the public revenue
the bills of banks refusing the redemption of their
notes in gold and silver, and fiom depositing the
public money with such banks. The suspension,
therefoie, pioduced a sepaiation of the moneys of
the Government frombanks, and the late President
recommended a continuance of that separation—
enabling the Government to provide foi the re< eipt,
safe custody, and disbursement of the public mon
ey, without the aid of banks And tins, sir, was
the gieat financial measure of his administration
Sir, I recollect the effect produced m this hall by
the message of the President at the called session of
1837 I heard it read from the desk, mthe eloquent
voice of the lamented F-anklm There never was
a more splendid example of the moral sublime
There stood Martin Van Buren on the deck of the
ship of feta'e, calm and undismajed amid the im
pending storm, v ith h.s colors nailed to the mast
the maps and charts of Jefferson and Madison were
spieael out before him, and he was guiding the
vessel to her haven of constitutional safety Some
of the crew became panic stiuck men who had
wmteied and summered in the iepublic?n party
and had been fed by his hand from its bounteous
table, left the ship m small boats, and deserted him
m the daik hour of his trial They stopped a short
lime at the halfway house of conservatism, situate
on a desolate island, but s0on got on boird of a
long, low, black-looking schooner, and hoisted sail
for the harbor of Tippecanoe And sir, what was
the result 1 The country was in distress The
sable mantle of commercial mourning overspread
the land In the elections of 1837 the friends of
the late President were defeated.   The loud p?eans

of federal rejoicing went up from every hill and
from every valley. But, sir, the rejoicing which
took place in 1837 was like the rejoicing at the
feast of Belshazzar.
In the congressional elections of 1838 and 1839,
the independent treasury bill was the sole issue
that went to the people The public mmd became
deeply agitated. The ocean of public opinion was
in motion from Maine to Florida, and from the
Atlantic to the buffalo regions of the west;
"Una Em usque, Notusque ruunt, creber,que procell*
Afticus, et vastos volvunt ad lntora fluctus "
The twenty sixth Congress assembled, and the in-
dependent treasury system became a law. Th«
" sober second thought of the people—seldom wrong,
always efficient," verified the early anticipations of
its great and patriotic author.
The system became a law in July, 1840 The
principle involved in it, however, had been in prac-
tical operation from the time of the suspension by
the banks Under its operation, the late admims-
tiation, with difficulties to surmount, and in a
period of great commercial distress, maintained
the public credit inviolate, promptly meeting every
demand upon the Government The revenues
were collected,—expenditures disbursed at distant
points of the Union,—the Florida war prosecuted,—
the Indians íemoved beyond the valley of the Mis-
sissippi,—the various and complicated fiscal opeta-
tionsof the Goveinnientperformed with distinguish-
ed success, and all accomplished with celerity and
safety, without the aid oí banks. And on the4th
of Match last Mr. Van Buren surrendered the
Government to his successor, with one million of
available resouices in the Treasury. True, the
now Secietaryol the Treasury pretends a present
necessity foi a loan of twelve millions, in anticipa-
tion of a futute deficit, but this is only to provide
Government stock, as a convenient mode of paying
in the cipital ot the pioposed I auk
Sn , thete is no valid objection to the independ-
ent treasury sjstein Undei its operation, business
has revived, labor is íewaided, puces have in-
ci eased, and will be regulated by the immutable
law s of demand and supply, and stability is observ-
able in all the departments, of trade and commerce.
The country is moving lorward with the stride* of
a giant, at a slow and equable pace, to new acces-
sions of national prosperity and renown. The
people aie contented and happy. They desire no
change in the fiscal operations of the Government.
They have sent here no petitions for repeal of ex-
isting regulations They are willing to give th 
measure'a lair trial They aie unwilling to go
back, and adopt that system which had before
wrought their ruin
But, sir, the distinguished gentleman from Penn-
sylvania (Mr. Sebgiant) contends that the consti-
tutionality and expediency of a national bank hav 
been settled by the approbation and judgment ot
the American people Sir, the people have given
unequivocal manifestation of their opposition to it,
in different periods of our history. In 1811 its re-
charter was refused by the casting vote of George
Clinton As I was standing the other day by his
beautiful monument in the congressional giave-
yard,—of all the acts of his patriotic and distinguish-
ed life, this one lose most prominent to my mind. It
is the one which will embalm his memory m the
gialcful recollections of the people, and carry his
name down to posteuty v\ith a íeputation ever
gathering fiesh laurels, and with the triumphs of a
distinction thiiwillncver die The people decided
against a national bank in 1832, mre electmgGen-
eiat Jackson, after his veto upon the recharter of
the late banii The people decided against a bank
in the election of the twenty fourth Congress, when
the issue went to them m the shape of a restoialiott
of the deposites Tne question was again presented
to the people in the election of Mr. Van Burén ía
183b He declared, m his letter to Sherrod Wil-
liams, that, if elected, he would oppose the charter
of a national bank in any form And, sir, the elec-
tion of " Tippecanoe and Tyler too" is no evidence
of a changed condition of public sentiment Gen-
eral Harrison, m Ins letter to Sherrod Williams,
avows his opposition to a national bank I will
read an extiact fiom his letter
" The question, then, foi me to answer is, whe-
ther, under the circumstances you state, if elected
to the office of President, I would sign an act to
charter another bank I answer, I would, if it
were clearly ascertained that the public inteiest m
relation to the collection and disbm sement of the
levenue would materially suffer without one, and
