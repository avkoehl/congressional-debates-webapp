I am permitted on this occasion to congratulate you and the State whose honor and reputation you have so well maintained on the possession of these handsome colors, won as they were on the evening of the memorable 27th of June by the conspicuous courage and devotion ever exhibited by your gallant command. The regiment which bears emblazoned on its banner "Williamsburg" and "Seven Pines," and will have indelibly stamped thereon the record of the bloody actions of the 27th and 30th ultimo, cannot gain new luster fromany lenghty enumeration of its brilliant achievements.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
