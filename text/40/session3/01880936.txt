TENURE OF Civile OFFICES.'
Mr. HARIAN. I now ask that the bill Ih
relation to the elective franchise in Georgetown
be taken up.
The PRESIDENT pro teiiipore. t There is a
bill before the Senate which was laid aside in-
formally. It is the bill (H. R. 1666) to repeal
an act to regulate th'e tenure of certain civil
offi&es* which is now before the Senate as in
Committee of the Whole.
The Committee on Retrenchment reported
the bill with an amendment, to strike out all
after the enacting clause, in the following
words:
That an act "rfcfeulfctini? the tefiuro bf cfertaiti civil
offices, pafes<$d March 2, 1867; and the same is
hereby* repealed. ^
And to insert lri lieu thereof^

Sec/5. And fie tt further eA'dctetl, That th'e penalties
provided ifa the set to \vhich tbisns ab -aiuendmeiH
shall apply %o violations of this met.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I think it right that in'fe
word or two I should explaih the action of thfe
coifimifctefe as it rSsjifedtS'thiS Bill. Tho Ifcmse
■bill p'fopQaes to sw^p frotii Ihe ata(nte-bSok
the law of 1807 altogether, and to restore for
all future time, so far as legislation goes, to,41)6
President of the United States the power which
Before tha't time he had exercised, of control-
ling the,appointments to alljjhe offices of the
United Slates, because under tha. previous
tioife, and filling vacancies thua created by pep
stitiSof hiS own selection without the consent
qf the Seaiat«, bad it in his power, and fre-
queritly exercised that power to hold persong
where he desired some otber persoa to hold an
office than the one to whose, appointment the
Senate had consented. As the Senate knows
and as the country knows, in 1367 we under-
took to reform this abijse, as we thought it was,
which had grown up in the administration of
the law, and provided the tenare-of-effi<;§ act
of 1867. By that not only all the.sub,or(Tiaate
officers of the United States, but the liead's of
Departments, were made the officers of the Jaw
and did not hold their places at the will of the
President. ; . .
The House of Representatives, aS I.have
said, now propose to sweep that atl away and
go back to the old system of things. The
iiOfflmittefe did H6t think that to lie wise!; $0't
legisiilinl; for to-day or to-morrow or the 'rrex't
^e'ar or the h6±t four years, but legislating for
the '6'6'uritiy, ftn3 for thfe future as^ell as for
the present, they thougiit we ought to retain
the "substahtial principle 6ft which' the act of
1867 W6,'s fo'uYided, that of making the public
service of officer^ who are exercising duties
imposed,upon them by taw dependent upon
the tew, according to the term thW the law
gives to thefh, Stria dependent upon the will of
the Senate advisory to the Will of the Presi-
dent in the selection of those agents. We
therefore have recommended ,that instead of
repealing the aot it be so modified as to permit
the President of the United States to suspend
a civil office? whenever in,his judgment the
public good shall require it, Subject in the end
to the approval of the Senate, and to dispense
with the detail which the existing law requires
of his having specific evidence upon which he
is to act, and with his being obliged to give
Specific reasons upon which we, are to act when
he comes to report his action to the next meet-
ing of the Senate. That was a mere matter
of detail and discretion 5 "and inasmuch as
under the adverse circumstances during which
and under which this law has prevailed a con-
struction is claimed to have obtained which, it
is saifj, ties up the hands of the President to
specific evidence of a specific and formal char-
acter—although that, in my judgment, is far
from being the true and fair construction, of
that law—We were willing to so modify that as
to remove all possible objection on the ground
of detfeil. '
Then a majority of the 'cOnmrftf^, one of
which, I am free to say, I was not,liHe thought
it fit that the beads of the Departments should
be restored to the will of thfe President along,
so as to give him for the future practically the
choice, independent of the Will.of the Senate,
of the hoads of Departments who are to admin-
ister the laws of the Government; and we
have, therefore, proposed to insett in the first
Section of 'the bill an ' exception which shall
exclude from the operation of the law these
heads of Departments. As I have said, that
do6s not'mest tify approval; butunderthe direc-
tion, of the committee I have reported it.
* Two years ago "I was strOngly in favorof leav-
ing the Heads Of Departments at the will and
mercy of the President. The eVents of two years
have satisfied me that I Was Wrong in the posi-
tion I then occupied find defended is well, asl
eSuld,-and that thte true interests of the Gov-
ei'Hiiight, the {jerinanent interestsofgood'brder
and security to liberty in society, looking over
a great-period of years, require that the heads
