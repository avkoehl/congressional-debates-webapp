JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

Major General C. L. STEVENSON, Vicksburg:

Hold 5,000 men in readiness to move to Grand Gulf, and, on requisition of General Bowen, move them. With your batteries and rifle-pits manned, the city front is impregnable.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, April 28, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The men will be ready to move promptly. To cross the Mississippi, both gunboats and transports must pass the batteries at Grand Gulf. An army large enough to defend itself on this side would consume much time in crossing. As it is not known what force has been withdrawn from this front, it is not improbable that the force opposite Grand Gulf is there to lay waste the country on that side, and is a feint to withdraw troops from a main attack here. I venture to express the hope that the troops will not be removed far, until further developments below render it certain that they will cross in force.

C. L. STEVENSON.

JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General TILGHMAN, Goodman's Station:

Bring all your command, excepting guards for the bridges before referred to, to Canton, and await orders there.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General TILGHMAN:

You will at once proceed to this place with your entire command, excepting only the guards for the bridges.
