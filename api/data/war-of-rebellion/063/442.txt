Captain JAMES H. STEGER.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Warrensburg:

Please forward this dispatch to department headquarters if it meets your approval:*

Major O. D. GREENE,

Asst. Adjt. General, Dept. of the Missouri, Saint Louis:

My sub-district is full of bushwhackers. Report says other large bands are moving up. I have nearly 400 men without horses, and over three counties full of brush to guard. Is there way that I can get horses?

J. H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

INDEPENDENCE, MO., May 4, 1864

Captain JAMES H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Warrensburg;

Major Pritchard is at Harrisonville and south of there with four squadrons of cavalry. Sent express to Major Smith last night to move to Pleasant Hill. He has three squadrons ready to strike in any direction, provided the enemy succeed in passing Major Pritchard.

JAMES H. FORD,

Colonel, Commanding.

FAYETTEVILLE, May 4, 1864

Brigadier-General SANBORN:

Major Fitch, with 100 men, were to attack Cane Hill at sunrise this morning. I learn since they left that 300 rebels were encamped last evening at Prairie Grove. If this is true he could not fail to meet them at about daybreak this morning. He will move northwest for two days. I think the detention of five companies of my regiment at Fort Smith and Clarksville is a great imposition on this country. You know how it cripples me. Do try and get Colonel Judson to send them back, and great good will be gained.

M. LARUE HARRISON.

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., May 4, 1864

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Saint Louis, Mo.:

Colonel Harrison telegraphs that a force of 300 rebels camped at Prairie Gove last night, but does not state whose force it was or which way it was moving.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
