SECRETARY OF WAR.

SIR: While a prisoner of war at Memphis Lieutenant-Colonel Woods, of the C. S. Army, a prisoner confined in the Irving Block Prison, was shot dead while he was asleep by Lieutenant Lewis [Denis Daily], of the U. S. Army. Colonel Woods had paid Lieutenant Lewis money to aid him in making his escape. After Colonel Woods made his escape Lewis had him (Lieutenant-Colonel Woods) rearrested. After Colonel Woods was rearrested he said Lewis did not act the gentleman with him; he had given Lieutenant Lewis his money and then he (Lewis) betrayed him.

Lieutenant-Colonel Woods was in charge of Lieutenant Larkin and his company. When Lieutenant Lewis went to the prison and asked to see Lieutenant-Colonel Woods he was shown to him. Colonel Woods was asleep. He (Lieutenant Lewis) drew his pistol and shot Colonel Woods in the head, which produced instant death.

Lieutenant Lewis was tried by a court-martial but was not confined and he went to parts unknown. The decision of the court was not made known.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
