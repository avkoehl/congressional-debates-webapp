be to take away the great inducement the honest
purchaser had to settle onfhe public lands—exemp-
tion from taxation for the penod of five years Mr
C. mutinied that the number of bills in relation
to this subject evinced a disposition to tale liom
the United States all the public lands as íapidly
as possible.
Mt CLAY of Alabama depiecateti the course

in drawing mto the discussion of this bi'l oth< r

by the Senator from Kentucky, (Mi Clay) The

with the Slates of Michigan and Arkansas, as pio-
vul d m the acts ior thur admission into the

induced Congiess to impose the res>uictton, on all
the States before admitted, not to tax lands sold by
the United Slates for live 5 ears after the day ol s tie,

Now the old States po -o- etl and cxtntistd tht

by whtnnsoevei thej nujthl be hell Until tht
admission oí Michym and "Vikans-ns into the
Union, the pul lie lands «old to individuals within
the new Stales, were exempt from taxation for five
1 ears after they weie sold The bill befoie the
Senate ptoposed to phce all the States, new and
old, upon a footing oí equality, as icgaidtd the
power of taxing the real estate owned by their citi-
zens, or by non-iesidcnls, wuhm then temtoml
limits In relation to the suggestion of theSenitor
from Kentucky, touching the advantages whith
ihe new States mifjit have denvttl from tht favors
conferred upon them by the old, in then legislation
upon the public lands, he could only sa}, that the
benefit which the whole Union received firm tht
industry and entrrprt'e rf the new States, m im-
proving the value, and encouraging the sales of tht
remaining public linds, far outv eighrd an) disad-
vantages which might hue «suited fori the spirit
of encroachment mirutfd to the new States 1 y ilu
Senator from Kentucky He did not, thtit fore
thmk that the people o<"tht new States were under
such immense obligations to those of the t Id, as had
Jjeeasupposed by that bougrable Senator
Mr CLAY of Kentucky still maintained that
the gieat motive persons had foi securing establish-
ments in the West, was the privilege tney enjoyed
of exemption from taxation foi five yeais; and if
the bill before them were passed, that great induce-
ment foi a settlement there would be taken away
In the comse of Mr C's lemarks, he alluded to the
squatters, wdio had gathered m great numbers, and
seized on the public lands, oigamzing themselves
mto companies, and thieateiung destruction to any
man who might choose to purchase, thus taking
fiom the Union the public property These were
the people who came aftet their pie emption lights,
to secure them m their ill-gotten posses ion1; There
was a law 111 existence, he believed,whit h aulhoi i/ed
the Government louse a military foice to dnve off
these inundéis What light hid they to ihe public
domain more than to the public ships'! Weie not
both alike the property ol the whole nation'?
Mr C alluded to the inequality in which the old
States stood, and for proof of it, he would point to
the committees, whole the powei was almost exelu-
s vely given to the new Slates, and fiom these com-
mute cs. bill after bill had bten íeported, all having
the same ohieel and all tending to the same end
Mi WALKER sud tins bill, which had bten
icp-itul from tht Committee on Pnblit Lands,
toi tuned no new pnnciple, nor did it set foith any
in w views It was the same, in all respects, ?s
the bill which hid been discussed in the Senate at
I   pi 101 session, and he hoped that the measure
would not be prejudiced bv the remarks of the
Senator fiom Kentucky, winch, m his opinion,
hid no healing on the merits of the bill bofoie
them At the period refened to bv the Senafir,
the public lands were sold on credit to sctlleis anil
others, and the exemption from tax, for the period
named, might have been a salutaiy measure Now,
however, they were sold for cash and the exemp-
tion was no iongei ntcessatv Besides, ths two
new Stales, Atkansas and Michigan, were per-
mitted, on their entrance mto the Union, to tax,
and .ill that wis asktd bv the bill wis, to put the
oihei Stales on an equal footing, by gianting tht
stmt pin lift to all
Mt CLAY of Alabama said he must ask the
ir (hi'grnci of the Senate to siv a few words in re-

mm (Mr C of Kentucky) set med to he endowed

t ause, or any ilescnplionof mdiv ubi ib ft was but
the other thy, that, in the discussion ol a little mta-
stnt, which he thought proper to tk nominate a pic-
II une bill—Ihe bill to stippiess change bills,
commonly called shin plasters in this Distnt I—Ik
thought proper to bring into discussion the Sub-
Ttea«mry, and many other important principles ol
the Administration He was then the advocate of
the poor—appealing to oui sjmpathies in behal/ of
the poor ncjwfs and he^ar qui'- of this District
Now, he had espoused the cause of the powctful
monopolist and rick land iperufotoi, withholding all
his sympathy from the poor tut mduslnons and
cnierpris ng settler c n the public domain Indeed,
Mr C said tht Senator from Kentucky had gone
finthet and denonncetl ihe settltrs is violators of
the law, who had tiespi«.cd and seized upon tin?
public propel lv, and were entitled to no favoi Sir,
said Mr C. although this is not the time t« discuss
the claims of thit meritorious el iss of citi/ens, I
cannot pass by these uniustifianlc denunciations
without some notice P.ven in regard to the
amount of money received, he said, it was not a
question of interest w ith the Government It would
be found, on a review of the history of our land
sales nndei the cash system, that land had sold
more rapidly during the existence of pre-emption
laws, than at anv other period. It would he found,
moreover, that the average excess, above the mini
mum, rrceived since the commencement of that
s\ stt m, had not been more than two or threi cents
peracie Let the Senator from Kentucky wan
till the repi rt of the Commi'sioner of the General
Land Office comes in, resnond n.? to a resolution
which had been adopted at the extra session on his
(Mr C's) motion, and he would see the Gt -
vernment  gained nothing,  m  money,   by  sel-
ling the pubhc land at auction. "the true
question would be found to be, whether the
Government ought to put it up at auc-
tion, and sell it to combinations of specu-
lator at the minimum pnee, or little more, and
thereby place it m their power* to extort inordinate
profits rrom, the cultivators, of the soil, or suffer it
to be bought, for the same money, by the honest,
poor, and enterprising settler, who had, by the
sweat of his brow, cleared and fenced his little
farm, and built bis cabin to protect his family from
the inclemency of the weather But, he said, he
would repeat that it would be tune enough to go
mto this discussion, and he pledged himself to he
ready to meet it when the proper bill came up He
would then be ready to show what description of
people, and whose interests, the Senator wa-sj ad-
vocating At the same time he hoped to be able
to show the mentouous character of the claims of
those intended to be benefited
"But (said Mi. Clay) the Senatorfrom Kentucky,
by way of giving forte to his imputations against
settlers on the public lands, has thought propel to
íefer to an act of Congress passed more than thirty
years ago, which aulhomt d the President of the
United State  to cause intruders to be removed by
militaiy (orce He seemed to imagine that the
mere existence ol this law upon the statute book
would be sufficient to stamp with odium the conduet
and characters of those w ho went upon the pubhc
lands wiihont previously purchasing. It is true,
sir, (said Mr C.) that sueh a law had been passed
at the time mentioned, but what Chief Magistiate
had ever enfoieed it, unless connected with the
actual or supposed intrusion of the settlers upon
Ihe rights of the Indian , from whom the land had
been obtained, and who still remained upon n
under the tieaty? For his own part, (Mr. C. said,)
although he had resided for more than twenty-six
yeais 111 one of the States where most of the land
hat! been acquired from the Indians, m the mean
time he had known of no instance of an order to
remove the sattleis on any other ground than he
had mentioned, by military force. Indeed, he
might ask, what Chief Magistiate ever would
attempt to expel settlers, by such force, from the
public domain' Would the Senator from Ken-
tut ley advise the exercise.of such power? Public
sentiment would icvolt at such tieatment of the
hardy pioneers, who went forwaid improving the
country, giving increased valae id the public IancSs„
and fat dilating permanent settlements. Nor ditt
he know of any penalty prescribed by law for cut-
ting and using any tuhei timber than that reserved,
ami suitable, foi ship-bntlding There hid bten a
"fiieiji acquiescence, he believed, by every Admi-
nisli ition, lor twt nty or thirty year*, >n the ¡.etlle-
mtnt, use and cultivation, of our newly acquired
teiritory, with the exception before stated Hence
ho had bten wan anted in saying, as he had ¿one,
when up In fore, that the Government had yielded
a tacit permission, which exempted the class of
pctsons. alluded to Irom the charge of being mere 
ti espassers
Mr C said he did not know to what part of the
country the Senator fiom Kentucky referred when
he thai get! the «etllers wim using threats of vio-
lence to deter others from the purchase of their im-
provements He said he knew of but one charge
of that nature having been made against any of the
citi/ens of Alabama, and that was some seven or
eight years ago, on the eve of taking up the bill,
which contemplate! the first general grant of the-
right of pie emption But, it happened, fortunate-
ly, that there were those picsent who weie able to
contradict the charge, or, so explain the citcum-
stances, as to give enure satisfaction, and the mea-
sure passed by a triumphant majority, and had
long since diffused its incalculable benefits He
said he bait htardot no other similar charge against
the people ot Alabama, or those of Mississippi
close in his vicinity, where large quantities of the
public lands had since been brought into market
and stdtl Bui, if such threats had been used by a
few settlers in some particular neighborhood, was
it fair, or just, on that ground, to assail all others,
and deny them the benefits to which they were en-
titled'   Was it compatible with jasiice to make a
