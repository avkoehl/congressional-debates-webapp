MAY 7, 1864.

General GRIFFIN:

Send back the heavy artillery battalion you have at once, so that I can send it as a guard for the train.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. THIRD Brigadier, FIRST DIV., FIFTH CORPS, May 7, 1864.

Captain MERVINE,Asst. Adjt. General, First Division, Fifth Corps:

CAPTAIN: The officer commanding my skirmish-line reports the enemy forming line of battle in our front. Can hear their commands. The line on the right of the pike is a very weak one, and as the artillery has but little chance to protect their own front, I am afraid the line will give way under a rushing attack.

Very respectfully,

JOS. J. BARTLETT,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, May 7, 1864-5.40 a.m.

Brigadier-General CRAWFORD,Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you throw your pickets and skirmishers well out to the front.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[Colonel LOCKE:]

COLONEL: I desire to inform the general that the gap I was directed to fill upon the withdrawal of the artillery regiments has been filled by General Griffin's troops, who connect on their left with troops of the Second Division, Fifth Corps. I have not moved my command, as the line is continuous.

Respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General, Third Division.

MAY 7, 1864-8.15 a.m.

General CRAWFORD:

I have sent Major Roebling to have you relieve the portion of the line held by the Second Brigade, of Second Division (General Baxter's); it is but a small force.

G. K. WARREN,
