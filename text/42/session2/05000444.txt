* Ex-dividend, t Chicopee, 20 per cent, regular, 30 per cent, extra July 1. f Lowell Bleaehery, 20 per cent. ($40 per share) extra in May. t Amobkeag paid
December 15; time changed from February 1 and August 1. IStark paid Deeemberl; time changed from January 1 and Julyl. §The Suffolk Company and
Tremont Company (each 1,200 shares, par $500) were united October, 1871, as the "Tremont and Suffolk," (par $100;) every share of old Tremont receiving
five, and every share of Suffolk lour, in the new company; then each holder ol nine shares new had the right to take one more at $100, making $1,200,000
capital in 12,000 shares.
It will be seen that the stocks generally rule
high and yield large dividends, and it is known
that many of the most successful establish-
mentsdo not declare dividends nor sell shares,
butkeep the profits in the joint fund, to enlarge
the business, and hold the shares in original
hands and tell no tales. Certainly the manu-
facturing capitalists of New England have no
ground of complaint. They are the most suc-
cessful and prosperous men in the land, if we
except the saraeclass in Pennsylvania. We do
not envy them j we would emulate their virtues
of prudence, energy, and enterprise; but we
must be allowed to say they have had their
full share of national bounty. We have given
them " the potentiality of becoming rich beyond
the dreams of avarice," and they should be
satisfied with what they have and fair profits
upon it without indefinite, inordinate gains at
the cost of the people. Their establishments
pay all expenses and yield liberal dividends
to stockholders, who generally do little but
receive their incomes, and they should not
stand in the way of such reforms as are needful
for the general good.
PENNSYLVANIA.
Two years ago I called attention to the in-
ternal revenue system of Pennsylvania by which
she supports her State government chiefly by
special taxes levied on interests and industries
which she induces us to protect and foster by
tariffs. At that time leading men from the
State admitted the injustice and inconsistency
of her conduct; and no man, not even the
gentleman who represents her on the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means, [Mr. Kellby,] at-
tempted to justify her in asking favors of the
nation for her industrial citizens, while she
exacts of them unequal contribution to her
own support.
Yet palpable as the wrong appears, there is
no evidence that reform has been' attempted
