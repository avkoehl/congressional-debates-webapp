Expenditures of Government—Mr. Murray.
Ho. or Reps.
$1,015,000, and now, owing to recent improve-
ments in floating steam batteries, all our stationary
works for the defense of harbors aie about to be
superseded and rendered worthless Thus, after
the expenditure of millions tn building up the
pi esent system of defense, we are about to be called
on to abandon so much of it as relates to coast
defense, as useless, and to appropriate millions
again to build up a system of floating steam bat-
teries for the defense of harbors
1 will now (said Mr. M ) turn your attention
to this system of harbor and river improvement,
to which, as it at present exists, I am altogether
opposed, as being both wasteful in the application
ot the public money and unequal in its operation
upon the people of the several States. I will give
you its history from the report of the Committee
of Ways and Means, which very briefly traces
its progress from its origin to ita present condi-
tion:
"This item was unknown in the early legislation of the
Federal Government    The first appropriation was made
in 1802, but prior to 1816 only $36,449 had been ejipendcd
upon two works, connected directly and indircctlj, with
navv yards and light houses    A Itw appropriations wi re
made In 1820 "2t \!2 and '23, ¡n me neiLiilioilioiui o   li„>ht
houses and navy vird«, amounting altogelht r  to $51,7 >0,
and in 1823 two hdrbor surveys wtreaulhon/ed at an ex
pense of $3o0    Alter wt had adopted the policy o! raiding
more revenue than was required lor Í eder il purpos s-, and
as the period approached lor the redemption ot the puplie
debt, this was one of the new branchts of e\p< ndittire
resorted lo in order to al> orb a contetnpl Hed   urplus     At
cordingly, and for the hist tune in Ihe lustoiv ot our legis
lation, nil r.et u as passed on the 20th o! May, 1826, ¡or
improving certain harbors and the navigation of certun '
riven and creeks , and for authorising surveys to be made
ol certain bays, sounds ind rivers therein, nientiont d     On
the 2d ol March, lb27, this wis followed by i regular m
riual bill ' to auihoriie the improving ol ceruin harbors,
the building of piers, and for other purposes '"
These expenditures  immediately increased in '
1827, to   $82,500,  in 1828, to  $121,000, and  in
1829, $505,000     In 1838 the appropriations were
more than a million and a half, and the estimates
for 1839, amount to fl,713,000
" The original amount already appropriated for works is
$8,919,043 bb, besides eanal blocks, ami the dt ht issumcd
for the corporations of the District, tor invtstmeiils m ihe
same, amounting to $T,3S3,490, making an iggrtgate ot
$12,302,531 6G ihe estiniaiis lor (omplttin,,' some of
tlie e works amount to $1,050,812 21, hut judging by our
experlt nee as to t inner cstiin lies, it will inuie | rubnbly
require tt n millions, b( sub s tin cost of somt ol the most
expensive works, for which there an no estate* at til In
addition to this,a tullís now puidmg, tntl would hive
passed the Ilouat at tin close o' Inst sissioo, hut lor want
of time, which, wilh the amendim nts, < mbr iitd appiopu
aliona tor new works, amounting to w ar a million ot dol
lars, and involving an ultimate expenditure ol probably iive
millions more "
Verily it is time for this branch of expenditure
to arrest the public attention All this has opium 
from the weakest, and as it was supposed the most
harmless btanch of the American system. The
tariff, internal impiovementson roads by the Fed-
eral Government, and the United States Bank, as
the leading members of this system, were all cut
down This last member of the family was spared
tor his infancy and his promise, by reason of which
forbearance we have puJ, within the last twelve
years, $12,000,000, and become liable, by works
already commenced, to the pay men t of ¿10,000,000
more It is furthermore proposed, by the bills on
your table, to pledge us by new engagements toan
ultimate payment of §'i,000,000 more Sir, (said
Mr. M ) how are we to understand gentlemen, |
when they talk of extravagance They will op- |
pose every bill which is indispensable for the pub- i
lie service, and then vote the appropriation of
millions to rivers, creeks, canals, bays, &c , and
then come here and denounce the Administration
for extravagance
But I have said I was opposed to this system of
improvements, because of its wastefulness.    We
have, according to this report, within  thirteen
years, made appropriations for one hundred and
three works    Of these we have completed twenty
May complete, with existing appropriations, four- ,
teen; of the others, sixty-one are unfinished, four I
suspended, one abandoned, and three never com-
menced      These improvements are commenced
along and around our coast.   The foundation is \
laid for the expenditure of millions.   Some are
badly executed, or injudicious in their structure or
position, and are at length abandoned     Many of
them dilapidated, and are renewed and built over
again at perhaps greater expense than ever. And
all this time there is a swarm of agents under
different names, sjch as engineers, commissioners,
supeiintendente, contractors, clerks, &e , all of
whom must handle part of the cash, and be quar-
tered at Uncle Sam's expense Why, sir, (his
report itself tells us " that many of the works
were built over again, and thatothers were rotten
befoie they were completed "
But I am opposed to the system, because of its
unequal operation on the people of the several
States. On this point the report is full and con-
clusive
"It is certainly unjust to apply the money collected in
some Stites to mere local improvements in a distant quarter
of the I nion, simply bec/mse they appertain to the com-
merce ot the c mntry ÍÍ every improvement of harbors,
rivers, and creeks, and Ihe building ot piers, is to be con
sldi red national m us character and benefits asanippend
age to our commerce, it is difficult to define any limit
whatever to the jurisdiction of the Tederal Government, or
to say to what purpose the common mnd oí the Onion may
not be applied The distribution made during the last
thirteen years among the stites, proves incontestably Ihe
injustice o* tin se expenditures I liewhole amount appro
pnated and invtatid is 813,300,000, ot which $0,190 000
has I  en granted to a district of country not one hundred
and fifty iinh sfrom the capital Without inquiring into the
import un e ol the works puroui/ed by the Ft dem Govern
inuit, it is sufficient to remark tit it most of the Slates have
beui at the Millie tune employing their own money and
crtditon iniprovf incnisinlinilt ly more useiu! and prohiablc,
ind betti r calculan d to extend the commerce ol the Union
some ot the States have not participate at all in these
Í reihnl ippropmlions While four btates only may he
chir„ed with $6,760,000 out ot the $12,300,000, and some
of the mi st t xpcnsive woiks remain to bt completed in
these States "
Well may this committee say, sir, (wild Mr.
M ,) that some of the States have not participated
at all in these Federal appropriations In docu-
ment No 254, vol  8, ot Executive documents of
i last session, is a table exhibiting the amount dis-
bursed in each year, and in each State and Terri-
tory, for the yeats 1834, 1835, 1836, and 1837,
for light-houses, fortifications, internal improve-
ments, and pensions, arranged under sepiuate
heads, tfec , &c , showing how much each State
received each year for each object It shows that
for those yeais theie was disbuised—

For these objects, then, the disbursements in

exclusive of pensions, the sum is   $7,402,781 79

In looking over this table, every head is filled
out with somethingm most of the States, and when
I come to New York, het sum for the four years
is $1,000,000 But when I come to Kentucky—
oh, yes, " Old Kaintuck," whose whole energies
have been disinterestedly devoted to this system—
I find her, like the unfortunate wight at the lottery
wheel, receiving for her every draw a blank. I
read over the heads of each object of disbursement
for each year, for fortifications blank, for light-
houses blank, for internal improvementsblank, and
"blank "says echo Yet Kentucky pays her share
of all these moneys expended, and then pays for her
own improvements besides, without the assistance
of any other State Foi, sir, she has improvements,
and valuable improvements, too, which are better,
and cost less, than if made by the Federal Gov-
ernment. If the bill for the Cumbeiland road,
now on your table, passes, we will have appro-
priated altogether $7,115,683 to that one object,
which will yet cost many millions The average
amount paid for each mile, between Cumberland,
in Maryland, and Columbus, in Ohio, a distance
of some two hundred and sixty-five miles, is be-
tween nineteen and twenty thousand dollars The
cost of one hundied miles in Indiana, it is esti-
mated, will be $15,875 per mile, and ninety miles
reported upon from Illinois, will cost §13,875 per
mile In Kentucky, we have the best Macadam-
ized roads, graded to two and a half degrees,
covered with two coats of broken rock, nine inches
thick, and all well executed, for an amount vary-
ing from four to five thousand dollars per mile
Examine, sir, if you please, the history of our
Federal improvements, and compare both their
execution and cost with the improvements of the
States, and my word for it, if you be not prepos-
sessed in your opinions, and your State is not
interested in expecting such appropriations, you
will turn with abhorrence against the notorious
injustice and wastefulness of the whole system
I might, sir, (said Mr. M ,) say much about its
demoralizing tendency upon the legislation of this
House. It introduces a system of combination a
and log-rolling, as we say west of the mountains,
dangerous and alarming m the extreme, when we
consider that our legislation binds the destinies of
twenty six independent Slates.
This system of improvements (continued Mr.
M ) constitutes one point of the real issue be-
tween the two great political parties of this coun-
try, and it is vain to attempt to falsify the title
issue by directing the attention of the people to
something immaterial and delusive. When Gen-
eral Jackson came into power, so much of this sys-
tem as relates to the improvement of roads, had
just ripened, as it were, into manhood, and set
out with all the extravagance of a rich and pro-
fuse heir, to squander whithersoever e would the
money he had acquired ft ora others But he wast
soon arrested by the firm grasp of that hand which
did not loose us hold until life was extinct. If,
after strangling this young giant of internal im-
provement, by the veto of the Maysville road bill,
"that extraordinaiy man," as I have heard him
denominated, had throttled this twin monster,
whieh has now grown formidable, and is attack-
ing us on every river in the inteiior of our coun-
try, and at evei y inlet, and creek, and bay on our
sea coast, and exterminated him in his infanry,
his poll ical caieer would have been complete
He would then have retired to the Hermitage,
with the consolation of Lycurgns, embraced in
the reflection that his country's liberties were se-
cure from alt danger against the evils growing out
of this question, so long as his policy should be
adhered to As it was, his services were invalu-
able, and he had full pi oof that they were so esti-
mated by his countrymen His return to hia
home from theaiduous struegles of his adminis-
tration against Federal encroachments (by which
terms I mean the encroachments of the Federal
Government) was brightened with every consol-
ing felicitation, like the tnumphal return of Nn-
polertn ftom Italy, or of Marlborough fiom the
continent But it were next to impossible, that
every evl could have been exterminated which
had been engendered and brought forward under
the destructive auspices of the American system,
which, however much I may admireand do admire
the splendid talents by which it was nurtured
and sustained, I nevertheless believe to have been
fraught with the most dangerous tendencies. It
had become too firmly seated in the body-politic
Its roots had penetiated all the ramifications of
society, and were rapidly ingrafting themselves
on every branch of our national enterprise The
friends of each darling interest, which had grown
up under its operation, were numerous and influen-
tial They filled your legislative halls, and enjoyed
most places of trust and profit under the Govern-
ment The monster was silently stealing into our
strongest citadels of prosperity and secuuty, and
was preparing to intrench himself m their posses-
sion, without alaimmg the fears of the people
And although his encroachments and designs were
pointed out by this true defender of his cnuntiy's
liberties, yet, it was not until he would firmly
plant himself against the advance of this rapa-
cious destrover, take him boldly by the hoins,
and cry aloud for help, that the people would
come to the rescue Maddened like the wolf for
the loss of hei whelps, the friends of these numer-
ous interests — numerous themselves as the en-
raged members of the disturbed hive — attacked
the old hero on every side, and with frantic vio-
