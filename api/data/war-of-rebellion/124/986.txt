arranges the payments to the troops, and superintends the performance of all the duties required of the Pay Department in such district. I believe it to he highly important for the interests of the service that these chief paymasters should have a rank above their subordinate officers, and would respectfully recommend that Congress be requested to authorize the appointment of a limited number of paymasters, say twenty-three, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, to be chosen from among the most efficient officers of this department now in service, and who can then be detached as chief paymasters of districts, or for such other special duty as may be of particular importance. The additional expense to the Government under this plan will be less than $7,000 per annum, and can be much more than compensated by the increased, efficiency of the force and the ability to dispense with the services of several paymasters now required in the different pay district and who will not be needed under such new organization. During the Mexican war it was found necessary to appoint two deputy paymasters-general, with the rank of lieutenant-colonel, for a similar duty, and that grade and number of officers are still retained, but are entirely inadequate for the large of paymasters now in service and the numerous and widely separated armies,&amp;c., in which payments should be properly superintended. The large increase of the number of paymasters, the consequent multiplication of the if accounts, and the other constantly increasing business of the Paymaster-General's Office have rendered an addition to the number of clerks authoritized for this office absolutely essential. I would, therefore, respectfully request that authority be asked to increase the clerical force by adding five clerks of class three, ten clerks of class two, and fifteen, clerks of class one.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. P. ANDREWS,

Paymaster-General.
