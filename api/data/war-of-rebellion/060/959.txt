FORTRESS MONROE, VA., April 23, 1864.

Captain G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy:

I think you can do more good to the service by coming here for twenty-four hours than anywhere else. Please breakfast with me to-morrow morning at 9 a.m. Perhaps you can bring the President with you.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

(Received 10.10 p.m.)

Captain G. V. FOX,

Assistant Secretary of the Navy:

Glad to hear that Smith is coming here, but it is not about the North Carolina matter that I desire to see you. It is something more important; do come. Will send a 16-knot boat for you. You are not getting out the piles, as I am informed.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

FORTRESS MONROE, VA., April 23, 1864.

Honorable HENRY WILSON,

U. S. Senator, Washington, D. C.:

Please have no action taken at present upon General Gillmore's confirmation if he is likely to be rejected. His corps is ordered here, and I should not like to change commanders just now.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SUB-DISTRICT OF NEW BERNE,New Berne, N. C., April 23, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commanding Dept. of Va. and N. C., Fort Monroe, Va.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose to you a copy of a letter written to Major Davis last night, and dispatched to you about mid-night.*

This morning General Peck sent for me, as I supposed to turn over the command of this district, with the orders, special instructions, &amp;c., that he might have received from you. He, however, informed me of some dispatches which he had received from the Sub-Districts of Beaufort and the Pamlico. He informed me that he should send to you immediately a communication on the subject of these dispatches. I then reminded the general that he had yesterday informed me that he should relinquish the command to me, and I merely asked, "Who is now responsible for operations here?" He replied that he expected the General Berry in to-day from Fort Monroe with dispatches, and that when she arrived he should turn over the command, if no orders to the contrary arrived. I have merely thought it proper to inform you of this. I have no complaints to make.
