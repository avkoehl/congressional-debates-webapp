PULASKI, TENN., January 27, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE E. SPENCER, Athens:

It is probable I can leave seven companies of Eighteenth Missouri with Phillips by mounting the company now at Pike bridge. The two regiments of infantry sent to the junction of the railroad will aid them some.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., January 27, 1864.

Colonel SPENCER, Athens:

Let Phillips go and take all the men he can. I will get Sawyer to order Moore to send a force to Brown's Ferry. Tell Phillips to keep me posted in his movements, and to have patrols kept out day and night while he is gone.

Is the Third U. S. Cavalry at Athens? Phillips must be very watchful, for he knows I will have no men mounted to support him.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., January 27, 1864.

Colonel GEORGE E. SPENCER, Athens:

Have Phillips go. I sent dispatch for him to go this a. m. I have requested Captain Sawyer to push some infantry down to the junction, to send the third U. S. Cavalry to Athens to remain while Phillips is gone, also to order companies form mooresville to Brown's Ferry, but I have no answer as yet. You better remain there until I get an answer. At any rate keep out scouting parties on the roads and watch those ferries.

I think Phillips can whip all on this side, but they appear to have good facilities for crossing and getting information. Do you think the attack was intended on Athens until after they knew Phillips had gone?

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
