THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February'22,
according to their theory. This country is
governed and is organized upon the theory
of the intelligence of its people, and the peo-
ple are expected and called upon to under-
stand the details of administration and the
great subjects to which it relates; and that
theory we have by national authority imposed
on the people of the entire country without
distinction of condition or race.
Now, sir, the sending out of these books
gratuitously is a great measure of instruction
of the people in regard to the great adminis-
trative measures to which it relates. The
defects which led to the loss of documents
have been recently corrected. The old agri-
cultural reports were not preserved, the old
Patent Office reports were not preserved, be-
cause they were not worth preserving. Those
of late years are eagerly sought by intelligent
farmers, by intelligent inventors, by intelligent
men of all classesall over the country, because
they are the best books and the best author-
ities of the kind. They go into public libra-
ries, they go into village libraries, they go into
school district libraries, and they form the
nucleus by which libraries are founded, and
they lead to instruction and the growth of
intelligence.
The abolition of the franking privilege and
the abolition of free distribution among the
people is a part of that system which is the
delivery of the public sentiment of this country
to the legislation of this House and of the
Senate into the hands of a few great newspa-
pers of the great cities. I am surprised that
gentlemen Tike my colleague and gentlemen
like the chairman of the Committee on Ap-
propriations do not see what they are endeav-
oring to bring this country to. The facts col-
lected with labor and toil by public men whose
attention has been given to this or that special
duty are to be doled out to the people in such
measure, and with such distortion, and with
such correction as the conscience or the intel-
ligence of the men who provide sensational
matter for these great newspapers may dictate.
Instead of an annual assemblage of Congress,
instead of an administration of the Govern-
ment by executive officers in the departments
among the people, you may as well sit in
your libraries at home and take np the morn-
ing paper and read the dispatches of the As-
sociated Press or the editorial of the editor
and register the decree at once.
My colleague is seeking to destroy and
strike dowu one of the greatest educational
institutions and influences, one of the most
important to the Representative and the peo-
ple alike, and to secure intelligent, pare, up-
right, well understood administration.
Mr. McKEE. Mr, Speaker, I rise to sap-
port the amendment of the gentleman from
Massachusetts, [Mr. Bdti.er, J which amend-
ment is leveled against the civil service roles;
and I am moved thereto by the report of the
various Secretaries in answer to a resolution
of this House passed at my instance. These
reports show the working of the system for
the past year. I have with a great deal of
care and labor collated these various reports
into this table, showing how many clerks, em-
ployes, &e.. have been appoinfed for duty in
this District during the year 1872. This table
also shows how many were appointed from,
each State or Territory in each Department,
and how many were appointed under the civil
service rules which took effect on the 16th of
April, 1872:
State
Department.
Navy
Department.
War
Department.
Post Office

By this table we find that during the past
year three hundred and fifty-one appointments
have been made in the various Departments.
Out of this number one hundred and eleven
have been appointed from the District of
Columbia; considerably over one fourth from
this little petty District,. This District has 131,-
700 population by the last census. Georgia has
1,200,000, nearly ten times as many people; but
Georgia had only two appointments last year.
Yet Georgia, having ten tiroes the population,
should have ten times as many appointees,
which would be eleven hundred and ten.
Well, Georgia is only eleven hundred and
eight short of receiving her share. So it is to
be hoped that the Georgia members will not
grumble at this slight discrepancy between two
and eleven hundred and ten. And Maryland,
a small State right here under the shadow of
the Capitol, had fourteen appointments, while
far-off Missouri, with a population of 1,721,-
295, nearly three times as many, had only one.
'' barely one. appointment. Surely the gn at,
powerful, growing State of Missouri may be
expected by her Representatives to favor this
system, which if unjust to Missouri makes up
for it by being far mor  than just to Maryland.
Of course the Representatives from Missouri
are sati^tied.
' Mr, PAHK.ER, of Missouri. How many
employes did the gentleman say there were
•' from Missouri?
■ i Mr. McKEE, One.
