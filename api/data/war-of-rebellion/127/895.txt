any particular command; but on the contrary, under section 6 of the act of March 6, 1861, "hold their offices only while the brigades are in service. "

Second. In practice, the assignment of brigadier-generals has been made by the President where they body of troops did not exceed the number sufficient for a single brigade; as, for instance, General Withers, at Mobile, of General Lawton, at Savannah. But where large bodies are gathered together the President, after ascertaining that the number of troops was sufficient to require the formation of an additional brigade, has not infrequently permitted the commanding general of the Army to assign the brigadier to such brigade as he thought proper, and of this examples are found in the Army of the Potomac and of General A. S. Johnston, at Bowling Green. A brigadier is never appointed without ascertaining in advance that there are a sufficient number of regiments ready to form a brigade for the general so appointed.

Hon. J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

DEAR SIR: The steamer Kate arrived here on the 18th and brought me your letter of the 5th instant. I am gratified to perceive that my action is approved. According to your instructions I immediately arranged for the transshipment of the Gladiator's cargo, and, as before intimated, I had no difficulty in obtaining the requisite permission from the authorities. You may readily imagine how intensely disgusted the Yankees are at this partiality, as they style it. It is called another flagrant violation of neutral rights. Owing to the boisterous weather that prevailed for some days we were unable to commence until the day before yesterday. The Gladiator lies at the upper anchorage, some five miles from here, whither I had her moved a few weeks ago in consequence of the large amount of powder on board, it being contrary to the port regulations to allow vessels with powder to remain in the harbor. I accordingly steamed up early on the 28th and superintended the transshipment of the following portion of the Gladiator's cargo, now on board of the Kate, as per bill of ladinBlankets and serge. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .

Having no invoice of the cargo I had to take the contents as marked on the packages. Total number of packages, 1,552. We completed loading this morning, and the Kate proceeds to sea this evening with fine weather and a good prospect of reaching her destination in forty hours. You will perceive that I have filled out the bill of lading for
