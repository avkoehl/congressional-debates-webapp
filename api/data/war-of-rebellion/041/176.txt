ON THE FIELD,

June 17, 1863.

The ordinary shelling of the fleet last night was productive of nothing except its noise. There has been but little firing from the land batteries to-day, resulting in severely wounding 1 man. The sharpshooters on parts of my line have been very active, but have hit no one to-day. The works on the hill opposite to my right are progressing rapidly. I have no means of stopping them.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The fleet was again quiet last night. The land batteries have fired at intervals during the day. Sharpshooting as usual, resulting in the killing of 1 man. The enemy's works on my right continue to progress rapidly toward completion. They threw up a parallel and traverse last night, the parallel distant abut 150 yards from the brow of the hill upon which Battery Numbers 11 is placed. The enemy's fatigue parties have been driven from their work several times during the day by shells thrown from Captain [S. M] Thomas' pieces in the outer work on the Troth road. He has instructions to fire at distant intervals during the night, to prevent any further work, if possible.

I am, major, respectfully, &c.

So far as I can discover, the enemy has made no material progress on the right. His ditch seems to be taking a different direction. The heavy guns of his batteries on both sides of the river, during parts of the day, have been served with much activity, while his sharpshooters in swarms have hailed their bullets on our lines. I have to report 1 lieutenant (Ninth Louisiana Battalion Partisan Rangers) killed and 1 lieutenant (Twenty-third Arkansas) seriously wounded by them. your order of to-day, directing me to retire the whole of Major [Anderson] Merchant's command, has been obeyed, as well as that other order directing me to make a permanent detail of 9 men from my command, to report for duty to the provost-marshal. In obeying these orders, however, I beg leave most respectfully to say that I think the public interest command originally given to me, the last is now taken away, and I am required to send away 9 men in addition. This leaves me with less than 400 muskets to defend over 1/4 miles of breastworks. I have at least one-third of the entire line, and less than one-sixth of the fighting force to defend it with. Besides, when the center and left were in danger in
