a. m. in the following order: First Brigade, Fifth Wisconsin Battery, Second Brigade, Second Illinois Battery, *Third Brigade. Ascertaining that the road cut out yesterday was not practicable for artillery, took one farther to the left. The Tenth Michigan Infantry was ordered to deploy, and moved forward on the one cut out yesterday toward Shoal Creek Church. The Fourteenth Michigan Infantry was thrown out as flankers on right and left, when the division moved forward, without resistance to the church, and taking up a line fronting Shoal Creek, massed up by brigades in close column by division. My line of march was too far to the let, and for a short time interrupted that of the Fourth Corps. At 12am. marched to Couch's, on Fairburn and Jonesborough road, six miles from the latter, and bivouacked for the night. August 31, Second Brigade ordered to report to General Baird at 3.35 p. m., by direct order from Major-General Thomas. The First and Third Brigades moved at 4 p. m., on the road taken by General Baird's division; when the head of column had moved some one and a half miles, countermanding orders wee received, when, moving by the left flank, arrived at Renfroe's, on Jonesborough road, and took up a position covering the Jonesborough and Fayetteville road, bivouacking for the night.

September 1, in accordance with verbal orders received from corps headquarters, the First and Third Brigades moved back on Fayetteville road to the Rough and Ready and Jonesborough road, following the First Division, with orders to take up position on the right of General Baird, halting in rear of his line. While preparing to take up position received orders to move forward with my whole division toward Jonesborough, following General Carlin's division. On arriving with head of column at Toland's house, three and a half miles north of Jonesborough, halted to enable General Carlin to take up a position. As I had been ordered to form on his left, soon after, by order from Major-General Thomas, Colonel Dilworth was directed to send forward a regiment from his commanded, deployed as skirmishers, and clear the front on General Carlin's left. By subsequent orders from corps commander, this regiment was withdrawn and a new position assigned to my command upon the right of General Carlin. My orders were to cross Flint Rive and gain a ridge to the left of that stream and form a line of battle facing near south the Second and Third Brigades deployed in two lines, and the First in reserve, my right to the left of General Howard's command, and that General Carlin would form on my left, not to fell uneasy about any gap that might occur on my right, as it would be supported by a division of the Seventeenth Corps. Measures were immediately taken to place my command in position, moving to Flint River and crossing it. The enemy was soon discovered in a strong position on a ridge running nearly east and west, and two batteries commenced shelling my lines severely. Gardner's battery and a battery from the Seventeenth Corps were soon placed in position, and a brisk artillery fire continued during the afternoon, Barnett's battery subsequently taking part. After crossing Flint River a bad swamp was encountered, across which bridges had to be constructed. Officers and men worked with a will, notwithstanding they were under a heavy fire. Crossing the swamp, soon took up a position at about 200 yards in front of the enemy's lines in the following order: The Third Brigade (Colonel Dil-
