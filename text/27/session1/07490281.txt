SPEECH OF Mr. McOLELLAN,
Of NLW YORK,
On lhe bill fiom lhe S'nale for ike chartei of a, Fis-
cal Bank o) lhe United Stales    Delnered vn Com-
mittee of the Whole on the ilatc of th? Union, tn the
Jfmsc of liepresentatties, Augusts, 1841
Mr Chairman   I regard the bill for the distribu-
tion of the proceeds of the public Knds, and the bfll
piopisn r a loan ol twelve millions, which have
receive  the favorable action of the committee, as
uieisuies preparatoiy to the   establishment of a
nati nal bank     To eut off one of the main arteries
if i  \ enue, and ot gmate a funded debt, are neces-
sary measu-es to lay the foundation for a national
banl   and fasten a public debt upon the country.
fntse measures are not original They are m
accordance with the pru ciples ot Alexander Ham-
ilton the ancient expounder of federal faith In
the pol itie di h tstory of the country there is a re
iiiaraabie coincidence between the years 1791 and
1341 just half a century after the establishment of
the first Bank of the United States In 1791, there
was a separation between the moneys of the Gov-
emrneit and banks The revenue -was collected
in go'd and silver, the constitutional currency of
the country, and prompth paid to the public creditor
There was then a standard of \alue, with which
all commodities „ould be comoared and their \ alue
ascertained Like the s andard of wci^1 ts and
measuies, n was uniform, and subject to no luau-
aaon   The Government, m its financial operations
