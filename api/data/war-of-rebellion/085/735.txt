Major-General CURTIS,

Leavenworth:

Price has left Jefferson City and is moving west. I shall follow him wherever he goes.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864.

Governor CARNEY,

Leavenworth:

Line open to Sedalia. No news in front of that point. The bushwhackers supposed to have done the burning yesterday. General Craig reports from Saint Joseph: "My scouts report Shelby approaching Lexington in force. Stores being sent across the river by post commander. If this is true he probably intends a dash in this direction. Can you help me in case of an emergency?" Shall tell Craig I will do all I can, but my orders are to look out for the southeast.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FOR LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864.

Governor T. CARNEY,

Leavenworth:

Operator at Independence says the scout just come in from Lexington road and run on to six pickets, and on pursuing them came on to about seventy-five advance guard drawn up in line of battle. The scout mentioned by the operator had been sent out by my orders to feel the enemy reported back of Lexington.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FOR LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864.

Governor T. CARNEY,

Leavenworth:

Todd commanded the depredators at Otterville, east of Sedalia. He had 108 men and moved northwest. It seems hardly possible that it can be his force reported near Independence. Lexington reports all right. Boats sent down by me, my son, Major Curtis, in charge, not yet arrived. They left Kansas City yesterday at noon. Have ordered all the operators to announce your proclamation. Hope to see you and General Deitzler soon. The militia in Wyandotte are firing a salute on the occasion.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 9, 1864.

Governor T. CARNEY, Leavenworth:

Operator now says scouts report Lexington captured and the advance near Independence.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
