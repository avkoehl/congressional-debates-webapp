Independent Treasury—Mr. Jilleu.
H. of Reps.
It lullv -a'lsfUJ 'hat t'.e welfare, present and prospective, ol
the country/ e i andedi.s adoi tion 1 iniqlit be constrained, bva
¡ugh sen e\ t patriotism and dut-v to disiegard the cntangie
n ents o! partv il wiie ai ! all peisonal considerations,, and
d'opt auiurst oí auion d aroet lcally opposite to that I have
heretofore pursued
1 «as opoised to the Sub Tieasury plan when presented at
the evtia session ol Cuncrtss in ls>7, and have so continued to
this tune and loi these leasoas <ti km ¿oiheig Because it will
expose the mo lev ol the Government to new hazan's ol loss,
'«cause it will tend to make tw > cunencies, the be'ter one lor
the Government, and the pooler one lor the people, because it
«,¡1 nvolve at the eomnienccment, and annually hereafter, a
great expend, lor v.1 ich time isnotthe sliehtest necessity, be
cause ol the enormous patronage it w ill put at the disposition
ol theE\etuuve l> tause, prai tically, it will put the public
money under hi  .insoluto loiurol,"thereby eontrary to all
sound Republican dicuine, to the lessons taught us by'history,
and in utter contempt ot the dictates ot common sense, uniting
the purse and the sw nd in the same hands, and, finallv, because
it is one ol a senes ol expennients that has been in "process of
execution for eight yeais back, and which has proved little else
than aseries ot clisasteis and mislortunes to the country, alike
destructive to the moials, the prosperity, and the happiness of
our people
These were some of the objections I had to the proposed
measure, and alter again hearing and considering the argu-
ments presented by us Iriends, I am obliged to say that my ob.
jec ions, instead ol being obviated, have received additional
strength.
The questions now in issue, I understand to refer to the mode
of keeping the public tunds between the times of collection and
disbursement, and to the kind of currency in which they shall
be rereived
And simple and|isoIatetl as they appear at first sight, it seems
to me they involve considerations of the highest importance to
the safety and perpetuity of our institutions, and the welfare of
our people
If I had the ability to e\amme them all as they merit, time
would not permit at this late period in the discussion and of the
session, and I shall therefore veiy briefly allude to but a few
of them, and to some ot the reasons urged bv the friends of the
bill in its behalf We were told, sir, by the gentleman from
New Hampshire [Mr atherton] that the banks claim the cus
tody and use of the public money A'l the banks, or but a
part! and if a part, which' When and how d'd they do it, and by
whom and to whom was the claim prefei red' This is a question
of fact, an 1, like other n atters of lact, it must be susceptible oi
proof Where, I ask, then, is the proof Let it be shown or
let the charge be withdiawn Ido not believe it is well founded,
or that a particle of evidence can be adduced to wairantsuch
an mferenc-, and my opniiJD is, that the banks would here-
in tant to take the puhhc money at all, and they certainly
would refuse it il they were tobe vilified as they have been
lor three years past by the party n power. But li I am incor
rect as to the lact. the binks have preferred a claim for which
there i  no found i ion wha ever A (.'aim presupposes a riah';
and the banks have no moie right to the custody of the public
funds than has a turnpike company It is not upon any basis
ol right that the opponen's ol this measui e would place the mo-
ney in them, nor o, account of the banks as such—but foi its
«aierv. and loi the benefit oi the | eople, and to avoid the mam
fold dai srers madent to the contemp aied system
We were furthei told by the same srentleman, that the public
money should be m the hands ol ofhctrs ie-ponsible to the peo-
ple Wi I this object be accomplished by the adoption olthe
 ub Trea-ury plan1 How, I beg to know, are these Sub Tiea-
"iirers tobe made responsib'e to the people! The President is
to appoint the Receivers Geneial and then subordinates he
'-an make and unmake them at his pleasnre I say the Presi-
dent appoints, for although affirmative action by the ¡Senate is re-
quired, we will know nominations to that body have veiy
rarely been rejected irom ti e organization of the Government
down General Jackson asset ted the doctrine loi thelfirst
time, that the Executive was a unit, and that all thesuboidinate
Executive offkers were responsible, not to the people, but to
hiQi, the grand locus of responsibility, and that he, himself,
was alone responsible to the people But under the most oi
thodox doctrine of respo isibilny, the subordinate officers of
this Government are responsible to the people, but very re.
motely and circuitously. The Piesident holdshisstation for
the term of foui years, he may, on the day ol hisinauguiation,
appoint a very lmpioper man to olfice, and the people cannot
reach him before the expiration of the Presidential turn, and
then only throueh the President, and by ousting him only can
they oust the objectionable officer and as a thousami c< ir-ide
rations are necessanly taken into view at the Presidential elec
Hon, it seems to int obvious that this idea of lesponsibility for
all practical purpose  is entirely fallaciou-
lt is said that, by depositing the Government funds in banks,
wemiplya grant of political power How, sir, can political
power in this countiy be created or granted by implication'
a'id how can corporations, having no souls and nobodies that
are tangible, receive or exercise political power! Under our
Constitution and laws, every citizen having certain prescribed
qualifications possesses not implied but actual political power,
a id so may the stockholders and officeis of bank , not by rtason
ot their connection with banks, however, but without any rele
rence to them If it were said that men with money have moie
power, politically and otherwise, than men without money, it
would be unqu  .onably true, because a rich man h'as more
mean  for conten ig benefits and forinflicting injunes, than a
poor one But tins power does not depend upou the nature of
hie investment , for the man having money will have the influ-
ence pertaining to it, whether it be used for banking pur
posess, or for manufacturing purposes, or be lent to his neigh-
bors
It is urged that the Sub-Treasury system should be adopted,
to prevent the use of the public money; and how long, let me
a-k has it been the doctrine of the Administration party that
the people should be deprived of the benefits resultir é from the
employment of their own money? What said Piesident Jack
son, in his celebrated manifesto, after the lemoval in 1833 of
the deposites from the Bank of the United States to the State
banks'   It was, lhat
"The funds of the Government will not be annihilated by be-
ing transferred They will immediately be issued for the bene-
fit of trade and if the Bank of the United Statescurtails its loans,
the State banks strengthened by the public deposites, will ex
lend theirs "
Hut the fxtnoidmary circular of Mr Taney, then secretary
of the Treasury, is sti.l more to the point, it is conclusive He
sani to these bulks
"The deposites ol the public money will erable you to afford
mcieased Ncilnies to the commeicial and other classes of the
community, and the Department anticipates from you the
adoption ol such a couise respecting your accommodations,
as will pi ove acceptable to the people, and sale to the Govern-
ment "
And what said the President two yeais aftei, when the pro-
cess had been going on for more than three years by the State
banks!
"To retain the public revenue in the Treasur), unemployed
in any way is impracticable It is considered against the ge-
nius of our Iree institutions to lock up in vaults the Measure of
the nation Such a treasure would doubtless be employed at
some time, as it has been in other countries, when opportunity
tempted ambition "
Geneial Jackson says it is "impracticable" to prevent the use
ot the public money, and I ask those gentlemen about me who
believe in the infallibility of his judgment, why it is that we
should attempt to do that which was pronounced impracticable
by such authonty'
II the money be used by a Sub-Treasurer, it will be for his
own benefit, or that ot his friends; if by a bank, then for the be
tiefit of the stockholders on the one side, composed ol rich men,
poor men, widows, children, charitable associations, and the
like, and the profit derived is the equivalent foi thelaboi and re
sponsibihty of manag ng the funds But other than the inte-
rests of the stockholder are to be looked to in the investigation
of this question Our country, like all other new and sparsely
settled countries, is deficient in capital We have fertile land
in abundance, and the means of acquiring wealth without stmt,
but we must have time to produce such a result, such
a supply of money, that it may be cheap, as, in Hol-
land and England, and on the Continent, results fiom
the industry and economy of ages. In the United
States, money has always commanded a high rate of in-
terest, because the supply fell short of the demand for profitable
investment. If the public money be deposited in banks, the
average amount constitutes the basis of discounts for the benefit,
directly or circuitously, of manufacturers, mechanics, mer
chants, planters, and every body who wishes to buy or sell labor,
merchandise, cotton, wheat, tobacco, or any thing else, and
while the most beneficial effects thus flow through a thousand
channels, "the Republic receives no detriment," so long as its
drafts ate duly paid, and if we look at the Government as dis-
tinguished from the people, odious though the distinction be, we
find that that, too. receives great benefit from the increase of the
means ol its citizens fin ther to contribute to the public neces-
sities.
But, without reference to the high authonty cited, let me ask
if Sub Tieasurers will not use the public funds, for Sub Trea
surers we always have had, and must have, for collecting and
disbursing the revenues
In December last, Mi Woodbury made a report to the House
of Representatives, (Doc No 10,)which contains a table show-
ing the losses of the Government by disbursing officers, and by
collecting officers, in each case, from 1789 to 1636, mclusiv e,
which presents the following results

Making a total loss of sevm millions of dollars, within a frac-
tion.
And it must be recollected that the above does not include the
losses that have occurred or b«en discovered unte Mr Van
Burencame into power, known to amount to about two and a
half millions, and how many millions may be discovered under
some searching operation by and by, no one can tell.
An important item to betaken into consideration, too, is, that
the losses prior to 1837, occurred among agents presumed to
have the public money in their possession but temporarily;
whereas the proposition now is, that the collecting agents shall
continue to keep in their hands the money till paid to disburs
ing agents, and the danger must thereby be greatly increased
In addition to hazards ol loss by fraud and violence, a sub-tiea
surer must be made of sterner stuff than most men, if he can
resist opportunities that will always bo urged upon men in pos-
session of large sums of money, to advance his own fortune,
or to relieve the distresses of a friend by the use, for a brief
time, of a small part of the money rusting in his vaults; fully
confident of his ability to replace it whenever it may be wanted,
and this he probably will do for a season But repeated expe-
iiments, successfully practised, will beget confidence, the sums
so abstracted will become larger, and the time longer, and in the
end, nine oui often 01 youi ¡¡gents w 11 be found, 111 spue of all
barriers you may ciect 10 pieveit it, to have used your mo-
ney, and nine out of ten of those v\ ho do so use 11 will pi ove de-
faulters

zlement asm a b<ok beidtisi f wei persons will have access

smon, but I am not satisfied it is well applied The bill pro-
vides for 'en 1 lei 1 s I'u the lorn Receiveis General Does any
bodv suppose that a nuinbei like this will be found physically
competent to transact tV ' u ip^ nder their charge! Bank
notes, bank checks trar«lei«ui credit, and every thing of the
kind, are to be supeit-eded, and coin must be counted, twice at
least an 1 this will be no iigl t aboi at the important offices
How aie the three possibly leu  clerks assignable to the New
York office, to count one, two, and, peihaps, sometimes five
hundred thousand dollars, 111 a day, m coins from sixpencss up
to eagles, 11 addition to then othei duties' And, if justice be
done to the peisons transacting business there, there must be
force enough, at all times, to do the maximum labor of any day
Whv sir, 11 is absurd to sur pose that ten cleiks, or ten times
ten, will be physically able o do the woik at the four great
offices, if the collections die to be in specie and the friends of
the bill know it
Rut, in the smailet efhets it is not proposed to have clerks,
and is it expected, Mr Chairman that a receivei at a land
office is to mount guard, eveiy day, in proper peison, over the
fifty or one hunched thousand dollars in his custody, or that he
is to sleep every night unuer his own roof, or that he is to be
specially exempted from the attacks of diseate or ef death
itself, because he happens to hold a comnuss.on from the Go-
vernment to collect, and safely to keep, its revenue:-?
How is the comparative safety in other respects'! What is
the safe and expedient practice for individuals may be such
for an aegregate of individuals as a political community
What do you, Mr Chairman, with a considerable sum of mo-
ney when paid you! Do you, sir, carry it aboutyour person, or
even lock it up at home, exposed to the thief by day, the robber
by night, and to the flames that may consume your house and
its contents at any fuuT or do you deposite it forthwith in the
Bank of Vuginia' I venture to say sir, you do the last, or 1
have much mistaken youi characb 1 for pru 'ence, good judg
ment, and common sense, al1 so fiequenty exhibited on this
floor
And how stands the qi estion in other and much higher re-
spects than asto the mere security of the public money?
In l"v!4, when a plan substantially like this, was introduced
by Gen Gordon, a Wing membei of this House fiom the
Ancient Dominion theGlobe, then as tow, the oigan ot the
Admimstiation, declared it 'revolutionary and disorganizing,
and subveisive 01 the practice ofthe Government, from '89
down  '   And again
1 It isas palpab'e as the sim that the effect ofthe scheme
would be to bung the public Treasury much nearer the actual
custody and control of the President than it is now, and expose
it to be plundeied by a hundred hands where one cannot now
leach it "
Andas spoke the gieat Glohe thin, so bpakeallthe little
Globesthiough tie countiy
W I at, too, said the veneiable editor ofthe Richmond Enqui
ler, alvvavs the suppoitei o4"the 1 nlitig party, who oppobed the
plan in 1834, when piesented by dW hig.diid 111 1837, when urged
by Mr Van Burcn but who has since Leen induced by some
magic influence to leeoiisider his opinion-, and now avers hi 
determination to bink 01 swim with the Administration and its
measures?
"We have objected to the Sub Treasury scheme (so called)
that, in the first place, it will enlaige the Executive powei, al-
leadytoo great loi a Republic, secondly, that it contributes to
endai ger the secunty ofthe public funds, and, thirdly, that it is
calculated to pioduce two cuirencies—a basei one for the peo-
ple, and a better one foi the Government The more we re-
flect upon the mattei, the more we read the speeches of the
ora'ois on bo'h sides, the more fiimly are we satisfied of the
strength of these objections "
"It is certainly subject to veiy strong objections, not theleaU
of which is the veiy great mciease ol patronage to which it
must give rise, anu a patronage of the most dangerous 11 flu
ence as being so lmined ately connected with the public mo
ney "
Anda?aw
1 But 1 can see no adv antage, and, on the contrary, a fruitful
source of mischief, in making Government officers the keepers
ofthe cash Place about them what suards you may, in the
shape of commissioners, inspectors, of whatever else, pecula-
tion will be endless There is no security in it, and it will in-
volve heavy and unnecessary expense The chief and over
ruling objection, however, is the endless souice of patronage to
which it would give rise Make the machineiy as simple as
you may, and open to view, wherever money is, temptation
will creep in, and corruption in every form follow at its heels "
"Truth without fear" is, I believe, the motto flung to the
winds at the head of the Enquirer If I am wrong, you, Mr
Chairman, can correct me And when its editor felt the healthy
invigarating influence of it, he boldly proclaimed that the new
device would prove the "fruitful source of mischiei '—that,
place what guaids you may, "peculation would be endless"—
that "there was no security in it"—that' it wovld be an endless
source of patronage"- and that "wherever money is, tempta-
tion will creep in, and coiruption in every form follow at its
heels " Yet, with that extraordinary pliability that has ever
enabled Mr Ritchie to adapt his course to the exigency of the
occasion, he now ardtntly supports the plan he so warmly con-
demned, and is exerting every faculty of body and mind to
keep its authoism power Sir, if that wonderful character,
John Randolph, of Roanoke, were here striding acioss this
floor, with whip in hand and spur on heel, as in days gone by,
he would point to that as additional evidence, if it were needed,
to show the truth of what he once said, that Mr Ritchie was a
man of seven principles, to wit, five loaves and rwofishes.
vvhen individuáis or communities are inclined to change long
and thoroughly established habits, it is well to consult their
own observation and experience, and the lights of history too,
