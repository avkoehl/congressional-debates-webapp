FAYETTEVILLE, April 3, 1863.

Major-General HERRON,

Rolla:

My command consist of First Arkansas Cavalry, 1,020; First Arkansas Infantry, 830; First Arkansas Light Artillery, 110; total aggregate, 1,960 men. At present about 1,500 are effective, were they supplied. The cavalry have only 154 serviceable and 65 unserviceable horses, and are destitute of clothing and ammunition; only a partial supply. The infantry have the picket up guns from Prairie Grove, but neither tents, clothing, nor transportation. I have long begged for supplies. I understand General Schofield commands our district, and have telegraphed these facts to him. Colonel Phillips moved to Cincinnati, 25 miles west of this, and expects to move on Fort Smith in a few days. I cannot assist, for want of supplies, and must fortify here. Cabell is in command of the rebel forces of Southwestern Arkansas. The rebel cavalry are under Brooks, and are scattered at Clarksville, Roseville, Ozark, and Frog Bayou. Cabell's and two other regiments are on this side, at mouth of Frog; and Brooks, with the debris of five regiments, is on the other side, in supporting distance. They have hauled most of their corn on the south side, and have depots all the way to Red River, whither they skedaddle if vigorously attacked.

Major-General HERRON,

Rolla:

I sent a man to Batesville two weeks ago; he has just returned; he says Marmaduke crossed White River and moved northeast with 3,000 men on Sunday, March 29; expected to move up into Missouri near Black River; he left two companies in Searcy County, which were routed a few days ago by a part of Colonel Weer's command, and they have sent to Little Rock, to Greene, for re-enforcements. A lady has just come in from Little Rock. Price arrived there on the 25th, with his staff and a small escort, but brought no forces across the river. He is reported to have 6,000 men about 2 miles below the Rock.
