man says 250 crossed at Unitia yesterday. A scout of 10 Yankees from there this morning on Morganton road.

I ordered the scouts to go on to-night as far as possible, and then move back to or near this place to-night.

I will remain here until I receive further orders.

I am, major, very respectfully,

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY FORCES, Near Loudon, November 3, 1863.

Major REEVE,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to state that, after looking over your order of yesterday evening, I find that I failed to give you the desired information in reference to a brigade of infantry moving in the direction of Kingston.

I heard the men when they reported the fact to General Cumming. I have made, also, observations and inquiries, but have found out nothing about it. I think it must be a mistake of the men who reported it to General Cumming. Some of my scouts report that Colonel Dibrell crossed a part of his command below Morganton, when some of Wolford's cavalry attacked and drove him back on this side of the river. Colonel Dibrell has not notified me of anything of the sort. Two of my most valuable scouts, whom I sent across the river day before yesterday, have not returned yet. I fear they have been captured. I have sent a reliable scout across near the mouth of Little Tennessee, to see if the enemy are trying to lay a pontoon anywhere on the Holston, as my pickets say they hear a constant noise, as if carpenters were at work. The enemy's pickets are as thick as hops, and it is almost impossible to send a man over.

Your obedient servant,

J. J. MORRISON,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Forces.
