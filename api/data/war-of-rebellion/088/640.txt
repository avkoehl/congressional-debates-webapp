Your dispatch of 3.10 p. m. to General Gregg just received. I do not know where General Gregg's headquarters are. General Ferrero reported firing to the south of the Gurley house, and has his division under arms.

General GREGG:

Can you tell me how much force appeared south of the Gurley house just before dark and whether the line was re-e[nforced]; and will you not give your officer in command of the picket near me instructions to send me word direct if anything occurs to-day?

Respectfully,
