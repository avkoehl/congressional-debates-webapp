Mr CUSHNQ said the morning hour would not give time
to dispose of it
Mr. FILLMORE suggested that the committee should pasa
over the subject for thepiesent
Mr. CUSHJNG said he wished to pursue a consistent course
through this bill. If the appropriation for these clerks was to
be rejected, for tlu reason that they weie not authorized, un
less by previo as appropriation bilis, then be meant to make the
point of order on every appropriation of this kind, cut where
it might. He did not admit that the Committee of Wajs
and Means possessed a dispensing power over these appropn
dtion bills The House had, by previous appropriations, sanc-
tioned this precisely in th° same manner as appropriations for
the others which were included m thi& bill lie further
refened to previous appropriation bills establishing this fact,
and said that he claimed a vote from the committee on Lhe
amendment At the «ame time, he had no objection at all
to waive this motion and wait until to morrow morning, then to
renew it
Mi. C BROWN asked if it was morder to move to postpone
this bill, and takp up the Apportionment bill
Mr CHAIRMAN replied that it wie'not at the piesent
time
Mr GENTRY rose merely to express his conviction that
the Committee of Ways and Means had effected a great leform
of vital importance to the purity of this Government, and es
sential to the perpetuation of freedom What wete the facts
that this casual discussion had elicited'? They had obtained a
key to the vast increase in the number of officers, and the im
mense augmentation ol the expenses of this Government for the
last few years to some extent at least How did it happen
that under the action of this Government officers could be cre-
ated without the authority of law* To what consequences
mustit lead, if they should dehbeiately sanction the principle
that, when desired for any purpose whatever, proper 01 impro
per, to increase thenumber oí officers, it was only necessary for
the Clerk of the House 01 officers of the departments, bv an im
proper use of their power, to create these officers, an 1 then for
the House by appropriations to legalize them If they sane
tioned the pov tr, it led to------
Mr GUSHING saU appropiiations- were not made unde the
contingent fund, but undei specific appropriations
Mr GENTRY said it was still an appiopiiation which -\\as
not legalized That was the principle and he «¡iid the country
owed to the Committee of Ways and Means a deep debt of gia
titude foi exposing this practice All he iegietted wat> that
tbey had not omit ->d every dollar for officers not existing by
law, but created by usurpation of au*i c ity Tnis principle
was of immerse impouance, and vital <o the preservaron
of the Government To wnat extent could not the decreta
rie3 of War, of State, and of the Navy, and of all the D^
paitmen s, multiply offices foi the benefit of their lavontes,
mordei to increase the influence and ^x end the powei of the
General Government? Was not tnis principle of huh im
portaace, and did it not become this Huase, as the guardian
of tm, people's lights, as connected with eveiy thing j ertain
mg to the public exp^nrhtuies, to debbeia e upon tins
qnestio i, and correct these piactiees not by partially sanction
ing and partially di appi ovmg what had been done? He cqui
esced with the gentleman fiomMas achu&etts (Mr Cu Hi\g) m
opposition to this discr mination The íemedy should apply to
all eases, and this could only be dope by moving to i «commit
the bill to the Committee of Ways of Means, with instructions
tosti ike out eveiy item of apptopria ion nof authorized by ex.
istmg laws Tf it was piopei that these officers should cost,
Congiess could legal ze them, and let them thus rebuke these
impiopei uses of this Government With a view to make this
motion, he would move that the committee use
Mi FILLMORE appealed to the gentleman to withdraw his
mou in foi a moment, which being complied with, he said it was
tftM-f iy unnecessary that the bill ¡almuld be recommitted It
\ o> id only produce great delay, as these itcmscould be struck
o n in committee
vlr GENTRY sail it seemed to him that it was a more proper
con b   to lecommit it
Mc FILLMORE said, if tne mo ion prevailed a debate might
an-einthe House, and, as they could not move the pieuous
q ips ion, might cau«e a delay o( two or thiee week** They
c tul 1 pistas well take theq íestion on these items seveially m

The chai man inquired of the gentleman horn Massachusetts
[Mi pu&s^o] if his motion was to nine i--e the appiopnation
S3 000 to pav clei kb not a'Uhonzed by law
Mr CíJSHING said he had moved to stuke out twelve and
insert fifteen, that the number of clerks sanctioned by this act
might be the same as by formei acts
The CHAIRMAN said if ha understood that the rootion^as
to pruvide for clerks not authorized by law, he should rule the
amendment out of order Did the gentleman from Massachu-
setts contend that these clerks were authorised by lawl
Mr CÜ3HING Yes By appropriation, as were other
clei Irs for which provision was made in the bill.
The CHAIRMAN And without the authority of law the
appropriations were made heretofore
Mr GUSHING lepliedmtheaffirmative.
The CHAIRMANdecidedthat this was not authority, and
ruled the amendmendment out of order, saying that he would
submit the subject to the det ision of the committee
Mr MASON of Ohio obtained the^loor, but
Mr WISE rose to a point of order The Chairman had de-
cided that the amendment was not m order He submitted
wnether the items reported My the committee not authorized by
law, were in order.
The CHAIRMAN said when the committee came to them he
would decide Heundeistood that this provision was for the
pay of the officers and cleiks of the House of Representatives
If it was shown that any part of the appropratien was to em
ploy clerks not authouzed by law, otherwise than by previous
appropriation, be would decide them out of order
Mr CUSHING said he would show that He now raised the
question of order as to the present clause of the bill, for the
rule applied as well to items reported by the committee as to
amendments.
After a momentary conversation between Messrs. GENTRY,
M-VSON, ard WISE—
Mr GUSHING said he would refer the committee to the third
page of the leportof the Committee of Ways and Means, which
was a running commentary on the bill, fiom which he read coi
cernmg various items of the appropriations, someofwhich. weie
aiuh rized by law, others by resolutions of the House, and
others only by previous appiopriaton bills He said, without
going into fuither items he believed he had found heie about
the whole of this amount, authouzed only by former appiopn-
ations.
Mr MASON (a member of the Committee of Ways and
Means) would say butawoid of explanation, which he thought
would afford a satisfactory answer to the gentleman from Ten-
npssce, [Mr Gentry ] and give him to undeistand the extent to
whtLh tht Committee of Ways and Means had gone on this
question                                                 *
The committee hatl adopted the rule of limiting their appio
puationsto caaes that had been specifically and distinctly pro
vided foi by law They found that there were numerous cases
which they did not doubi for one moment wen not only neces
siry, but required by the public seivice, and which weie not
aut' omul by law, among which was the ca=e of the Repoiter
ef the Supreme Court oí the United States The committee did
not intend to aboluh that office, nor very many offices for whiuh
they declined makine appropriations Tliatclass of cases they
liad íefeired to a member ot the committee, who wat= now ab-
sent fiom tí e city unacu nut of domestic affliction It was the
inter non of [fie commi'ttc that a bill should be leported almost
simultaneously w th this niakine appiopnations for all such
oinceis which n the judgme it ol the committee ought to be
ci> fnued n roi equencc of the circumstances to which he
had refened, the bill had not been ic-poitcd Sucha bill would
beicpoited fiom the Commiu.ee of Ways and Mean , and when
this was done, eveiy member would haveanoppoi tunity of ex
pre*" ng his opinion with legardtotheparticulai offices whos8
salaries m eveiy instance would be specifically provided foi in
that bill.
The committee, In we ver, had thought that there was a class
of cases wheie appropuations ought To be continued from year
tnyeaijin order 'o prevent any di&astei whicn nnght overtake
the public service and those officers The Committee of Ways
nod Means had no objection that this committee should strike
out of this bill all those appropriations not authorized by ex-
isting laws He would suggest, however, that it was perhaps
anobfpctnot asdeQirable as might bp supposed, for, undoubt*
edly (lie me=tof the=e were ca«es that the House would terree
to continue, and offices which wue necessarv to the adminr
tiation of public affairs It had been a matter of policy with
the committee to insert these appropriations, and it would be
entirely unnecessary to refer tins bill back again He had
no objeciion that these items should all be stiuck out, in or
der to present a strong necessity for the action of the House
on the hill that should hereafter be reported to them He
was willing to have it done Those pir^ons interested
w uld have nothing to apprehend from the ultimate action of
Congress
