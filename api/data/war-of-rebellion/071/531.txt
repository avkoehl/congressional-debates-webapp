Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I am moving toward Emmitsburg as rapidly as possible, and will be governed by the movements of the enemy. Crook's column is on the Middletown and Wright's on the Frederick road. I deem it my duty to state I consider the information obtained by General Averell very unreliable. From all I can hear, the enemy's force crossing the rive is quite a small one.

If it be found that the enemy is moving north or northwest, you will be as much on his rear as you would have be moving west of the ridge. The main thing now will be to ascertain whether the main body of the enemy has actually crossed, and, if so, where it is. I will telegraph to you all information that is received here. It is also important that you give us all you get.

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

From information received here it is evident that the enemy, having crossed at McCoy's Ferry and Cherry Run, is operating westward toward the Bedford Valley, threatening Pittsburg remotely, and our posts at Cumberland and New Creek, by which route they will probably return.

Major-General.
