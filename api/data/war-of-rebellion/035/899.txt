Captain JACK,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAPTAIN: I have received your note. I did not design, by my remarks to General Polk's staff officers, to convey the idea that General Polk's troops were to guard the bridge. I did not think any guard necessary. I asked that the bridge might be held-not destroyed. I have notified the engineers that I would not require the bridge.

Very respectfully,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

GENERAL: Your order of yesterday (5 p. m.) did not reach me in time to leave a brigade on the other side of the river. My troops are now awaiting orders. Most of them bivouacked near the railroad. I respectfully request orders, and, as I am camping with Withers' division, 6 miles in advance of Cheatham, I shall thank you to send my orders for Cheatham though him, in order to save time. Withers is at Shellmound; Cheatham between Shelmound and Bridgeport.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,L. POLK,
