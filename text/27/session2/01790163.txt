out of delicacy to him, fail to present it But with regard to
the petition Suppose that it was a action, then was it a
greater breach of privilege than if it was genuine He consi
dered it vastly a stronger ground for him to found a breach of
privilege on, if the papei was indeed a fiction, than if it was
a genuine petition sent by the moat respectable men in the
Sute He would ask the gentleman fiom Georgia to «ay, if a
member from Massachusetts, or a meeting of men in the city
of Boston, should agree to present a petition of the House re
fleeting on them, or charging them w th insanity, and that
oharge being evidently a milder way of charging them with
crime—he aUced them, whattheywould feel towaids thatsec-
tion of the country irom which such a charge came
Mr  HABERSHAM rose in e\planition, but was called to
order by several gentlemen, and prevented from proceeding

he had not had an opportunity of dm nj sat sfactouly before He
wished the House and the counay to undeistand the nature of
the petition, and the part he hdd tafeen m icgard to it He
learned that the gentleman fiom Massachusetts had in his pos
session a petition that purponed tocóme fiom the county m
which he resided, and he accordingly called on the gentleman
and asked to see it On exa omat on, lie --aw that the name m

of country, such a> Richardson, Snub, &c but he knew no
persons having the same Chnsti in names and the same sur
names together He stated tht'se facts to the gentleman, and at
the same time told him that he believed the paper to be a hoax,
and that although, fiom the post mark the letter appeared to
come fiomthe place wheie it was dated, yet that he believed it
to have been thrown into the post office there by some one who
resided m another place, and wnodiditior the pui pose of de-

with íegard to petitions—I know he would put some petitions
in his pocket—a vast numbei of petitions which I feel it my
duty to present, but the gentleman has not insweted my ques

reflecting on him came liom the Ninth If he has no feeling in
suchacase, his feelings are different from mine
Mr HABERSHAM I will answer the gentleman I wou'd
have laughed at sucha paper, supposing that the author1? of it
had nothing better to do I wo aid luveh^d no other feelings
than mirth even if the paper had come fiom'he head of an Abo
litioti Society
Mr ADAMS Well, the gentleman has diffetent feelings on
the subject of abolition fro n iho e of the majority of his section
of the country
He had expressed to the House, 3M*- A continued, the opi-
mon, that if Oil petition wa^suPÍiaone as tne gentleman fiom
Georgia suppo>ed it to be, i wi^ still aguatei eutiage on his
privileges, and the ptmkg & of the Hou«e, thin if it was age
nu ne paper He p u himst f on bo¡h point*, that whether it
was genuine, or whethei it was a ftvgeiy, it was equally an
outrage on him and on the House He did not consider it to be
a fi tion He had bhown the pui ion to another m^mhei fiom
Georgia [Mr Warke'n] beíoic he showed it to the gentleman
who last spoke [Mr Habersham] an I h°, en examining it, said
that there were pt,rt>ons of the mines engned to it in the county

Mr WISE asked if the gentle nan fiom Missachusttts was

The SPEAKER ob° rved to the gentleman fimn Massachu

Mr AOAMS Well, sir, if the Speaker requnes me to take
my seat I shall do so—-not otherwise
The, SPEAKER having called Mr A to order, he was pro
ceedmg with his remarks amid loud calls to oidei, when
Mr JOHNSON insisted that he had no right to proceed, till
permitted to do so by the House
Mr ADAMS still continuing hisremaik-,

Mr ADAMS    I am n my seat
Mi STANLY moved to lay the question of reconsideration on
the table, which motion was cdrned
Mr ADA'VÍS then con inued This charge, as he had stated
to the House, was not a tnfl ngone It was not m ide by incon
siderate persons, but by persons of the highest respecabiluy,
and be bel evedthattheopinion expiesced by them that he was
laboring under monomamaon a certain subject, was entei Ldined
by many gentlemen m that Hou^e [Mi Wise It s true ] He
heard it said aciosb the floor that it was tiue
Now, if it was true, he thought that the House should take
it into consideration, and give he commit ee to which he be
longed authouty to choose anotherch irman, but until the fact
was proved, tic claimed the privilege allowed to all accused
pe sons of being considered innocent Ihe gentlemaniiom
Kentucky, [Mr Marshall ] who had done him the favor to
mike this injtion, was a! o more than half way as he said d
the opinion that tho&e petunnen were ngnt m chaiging him
with monomania, and he theielore, called upon the gentleman
to substantiate the charge, as the mpmonalisis weie not here
tt do it themselves He called upon the gentleman to sustain
t íe position that he (Mr A ) was incompetent to discharge the
duties of chairman of the Committee on Toreign Affairs
Though he knew that the whole slive tiadmg representation of
that Hou«e was against him with but a s riffle exception, and
he was afaid to name him, thaugh fee knew that the Northern
auxiliaries of the slave trading repieeenuition, which gave then
themajonty, were also agama bun, vet he hoped they would
allow the petition to be referred to thi Committee on Toreign
Affairs, to choose another chairman should M ey think proper
Should the committee do thi , he w oukl con^idei it an endoisc
ment ofthe charge, and would abide b> the decision In ^-aj-

Mr ADAMS continued reading as follow*

Mr WISE rose,and expressed the hope that the gentJeiaan
fiom Massachusetts might be allowed to proceed, without in-
terruption He was so used to the gentleman pouring Qutthe
vials of his wrath on his head, that he really nowdianot re

Mr ADAMS    I am glad of it, sir
Mr WISE said that he would ask leave of the House to reply-
to the gentleman, and did not doubt but that prmlege would
begrantedhim
Mi GIDPlNG3ro*e, and endeavored to address the House,
bat was £i led down by loud and repeated cal Is to order
Ihe SPEAKER here made some remarks, but the tumult
wab soereat, that the Reporter could not hear a word
Mr ADAMS I am adducing evidence that the same «*pi
rum this same section of the Union, that would diffiancbise
all the members of the House from the ftorlh, who wereop-
prbed to slave trading—that that same spirit, m infinitely more
objectionable a view/chaiactenaed this petition [Calls loor-
dtr ]
1 he SPEAKER observed that the gentleman from Massa-
chusft e would recollect that the permission that was granted:
him was an act of courtesy on tne part of the House—and
that, on the motion of the gentleman from Kentucky, leave was
only s;it_nted to defend himself from the charges contained in
the petition, and 'he opinion of the Chair was, that he must
confine himself within leasonable limits
Mir ADAMS Well, sir, that defence is, to retoit upon the
memorial sis the charge of a desire to disfranchise me, and alJ
from the same section of the Union, w ho do not agree with them;
and I feel it my duty to expose it in the face of the worlá I say
that it is perfectly congenial to the matter to read this letter H
eoc* to piov e the purposes of the memorial, and for this reascn
I wish to read the letter from Accomack, which shows the same
kmd of feeling.
The SPEAKER, observed that the gentleman was comment*
ing on the course of another gentleman, who would not be able
to reply to him
Mi AD\MS The gentleman is piesent
The SPEAKER The gentleman is present, it wtrue, but
the gentleman from Massachusetts will observe that leave is

Mr ADAiMto Well, ^r,does the leave of the House permit
me to read a little ex  act from this letter?
Mi WM COST 1OHNS0N objected to the gentleman's
leading anv portion ot the letter
Mr W1NTHU0P addressed the House at some length, con-
tending that Mr Adams should be allowed to read the letter.
The SPEAKER decided the point of order against Mr Adams,
and exprectjed the wish, if the decision was not satisfactory to
the gentleman, that he would take an appeal, and thereby get
the decision of the House on the question
Mr ADAMS Does the Speaker decide that I am not tobe
permitted to read a little extract from thisletterl
1 he SPEAKER The Chair has so decided, because it touches
another gentleman, ft ho has not been granted the privilege of a

Mr ADAMS apptaled from the decision of the Chair, who
then stated the question on the appeal
