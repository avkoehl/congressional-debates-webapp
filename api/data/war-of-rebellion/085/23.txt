will be a good guide on that side of the river; he will be aboard the Celeste. Mr. McLaren, another guide, for the east side of the river, will report to you. You will go up the river as far as possible, and then land and march on Augusta, unless you learn from General West or other good authority that the enemy is somewhere else, in which case you will march on the enemy. If General West should be at Grand Glaize, and the Celeste, or some other boat, can reach that point and help him cross, the result might be very favorable, allowing that Shelby is near Augusta. If is in my power I will send along more troops after you. Use every effort to have Shelby suppressed.
