Mississippi SPRINGS, May 13, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON,

Care of Major-General Loring, Bovina:

GENERAL: I am at Mississippi Springs, falling back on the road from Raymond to Jackson. I am waiting to learn whether the enemy come this way or go toward the Southern Railroad. I have with me Brigadier-General Walker, with 1,000 men of his command. Other re-enforcements are said to be coming. I fought Major-General Logan's DIVISION yesterday from 10 a. m. until 3. 30 p. m. My troops fell back in perfect order. The enemy has not yet pursued. His pockets are reported to be a short distance-1 mile-this side of Raymond, on this road. Our engagement of yesterday was very severe and loss considerable.

Very respectfully,

JOHN GREGG.

Mississippi SPRINGS, VIA CLINTON, May 13, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

The enemy are advancing from Raymond in force. I shall retire before them until further re-enforcements or other orders.

JOHN GREGG.

BOVINA, May 13, 1863.

Brigadier-General GREGG, Clinton, MISS.:

You must not attack the enemy in superior force, but fall back, if necessary, to Jackson, and occupy intrenchments. All the force now there and arriving will be kept for defense of that place for the present. If enemy fall back, you will advance on his flank and rear, taking care not to get into a position to be cut off.

J. C. PEMBERTON.
