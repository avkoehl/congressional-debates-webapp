Brigadier General J. R. ANDERSON,

Commanding, &amp;c., Goldsborough, N. C.:

GENERAL: Colonel Ransom's regiment North Carolina cavalry will leave to-morrow morning ans proceed to Weldon by slow marches (with a view of recruiting the horses, which are much reduced), and at which it to such point on your line as in your judgment stands most in need of this arm of the service.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, April 17, 1862.

THOMAS T. CROPPER, Esq., Richmond:

SIR: I have received your letter asking permission for Captain Jacob A. Cullen and crew of the schooner J. B. Brinley, of Somerset County, Md., now in Mathews County, Va., and Captain Joseph W. Statins and crew of the sloop Crystal Palace, of Accomac County, Va., now also in Mathews County, and also for Mr. Levin Dix, of Accomac, Va., to trade to ports where they may be able to obtain articles specially needed by the Southern Confederacy. I have no official authority to grant this permit, but if the provost-marshal of the district in which the vessels are lying is convinced that they are going for the purpose of procuring arms, munitions, military stores, &c., into the Confederacy, he will doubtless interpose no obstacle to their departure. Upon the arrival of such vessel at any future time it will be only necessary for them to report to the military commander of the district in which they arrive.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
