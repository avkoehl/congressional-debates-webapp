which they now suffered, as a consequence, ensued As to fee
Compromise, he had already said that it was his purpose, as
long as he should remain m the Senate, to mamtaiiHluti the orl
gmai principles of the act should be carried out faithfully arid
honestly, and, if m providing for an adequate reveime foraft
economical administration ofthe Government, they could at th 
same time afford incidental protection he wouid be happy if
both of these objects couid be accomplished, buiifit shouidbffl
necessary for the interests of Pennsylvania to go beyond a reve-
nue tariff, for the purpose obtaining protection, then he hoped
that every Senator and Representative from that State, and
those who thought it necessary to transcend the revenue, would
take up this subject of protection and carry it to the point which
heir local interests, demanded
Mr CALHOUN had no doubt the Senator from Kentucky
had stated his impre&sions of the circumstanies under whicn
the compromi t, was made but he (Mr Calhoipí) felt that x%
ft as due to himself to explain what weie his impiessions
The compromise grew out ofthe interposition of the State of
South Ca-ohna She was induced to tike that step first, from
a d^epcon7ictionthat th- tariff of 1828 was unconstitutional,
oppressive and ruinous to her mteiests, and, next because it
was calculated to produce those ruinous consequences which
if not arrested   wou d ovei throw the whole Government
In yielding to he compromise act, he yielded to the proposi-
tion that a leasonabie time should be given to come ü wn to
what wis considered t! e hiahest posaibleduty requisite for the
administration ofthe Go\einment
He disagreed wi h thebenatoras to his impression that Gen
Jackson would have prosttated the piotective system if the
Compromise act had not passed He believed U would have
been far beyond the powet of General Jackson, had he been
ever so much disposed to prostiate the system, potent ashia
\ ower was—and ¡n saying this he estimated the power of Gen
Jack«on very high
But as a proof that the Senatoi is wrong m his impression,
he would lelei him to die attemi t made in 1832, on the eve of
the payment of the pubbc debt by the Admimstiatinn of Gen
Jackson to ie luce the uriff to the amount which tht- wants of
the Government w o Jiequneaitei the final discharge of the
deot W ah the co opeu ion of the ¡senat r himself, and the
ami t i iff) ortion o C i grtss, wh it was «he ¿-mount of ¡educ-
tion then fcfccted'S Not moie than three million of dollars
Bu even that smalt reduction wat< declared to be a final ad
lusimentbyMr McLean then secretary of the Treasury on
behalf of tne Admmstration and by the Senatoi luir eli fMr
tLA\ ] on behalf ofthe tanff interests, when m fact, it ought
to have been a reduction of fifteen or twenty mi lions
At tie very next session when it was*cettam that south Ca
íolma wouid interpose lithe oppressive system was not aban
doned anothei effort was maJe, n ihe other House, by the
fnenlsofihe Admini tration, to íeduce the tanff still lower 
wb ch i owev r pr >ved ut erly aboiuve
In tne mean time, the ¡state of South Caiohr a interposed,
and the compromise followed lit- (Mr Calhoun) absented
to tne compromise because he was willing to 2ive time for the
reduction of the protective duties He wads no war acamst
the manufacturing interests He then and ever has wi hed
ihem well but he objected to the unconstitutional and eppres
sive means by fthich thej attempted to acceleiate heir growth
at the expense of the rest of the Union His first preposmen
wa to illow <■(. en yeai^ for t^e process ol reduction and final
ly yieidel reluaantly to the addition of two years more, and to
some o her obpet on ibie provisions of the bill, because he was
aversr to forcing things to extr5 nity But he onlya^sented on
the e-rpie^s con lnon that the protective principle should be
surrendered finally and fore* er and that no duty should be laid
but for tne < onstituUona! and económica* wauta of the Govern
me t
The compromise in his oiimon had ben productive of great
cood Ha i no uduction been made and the act o! 18-^8 had
