HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 5, 1863-11. 35 a. m.

General WARREN:

The general thinks all the indications from Howard's, Birney's, and other reports point to the withdrawal of the enemy, via Cashtown and Fairfield. The orders for our march are ready, waiting fuller advices from you. Please report by bearer.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

LEFT BANK OF WILLOUGHBY'S RUN,

In front of Pitzer's House, July 5, 1863-12 m. (Received 12. 50 p. m.)

Major-General BIRNEY:

GENERAL: The rear of the enemy's column has passed. A cavalry brigade is posted on the Fairfield road, directly opposite to us, and they have thrown out vedettes to the right bank of Willoughby's Run. No artillery in sight.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. BRISCOE,

Captain, and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 5, 1863-12 m.

General WARREN:

I said Birney went out 2 miles beyond the line of rifle-pits the enemy occupied, yesterday. I might have said Birney went out to-day; yesterday relates to rifle-pits and enemy. The general desired you to know that General Birney had moved out, but would no permit him to fire, for fear it might disarrange your plans or interfere with your operations, as you might not understand firing on your right.

Very respectfully, &c.,DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

JULY 5, 1863-12. 30 p. m.

General SEDGWICK:

All the information I an obtain proves withdrawal of enemy through Cashtown and Fairfield road. Push forward your column in a westerly direction. Fire on his force. If rear guard, it will be compelled to return; if not, you will find out. Time is of great importance, as I cannot give order for a movement without explicit information from you. General Sykes will cover your withdrawal, if necessary, and General Warren, who carries this, will read it to General Sykes.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
