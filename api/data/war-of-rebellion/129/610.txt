The whole organization appears to be defective and inefficient, and to a great extent explains the invariable reports of inspectors, that the duty of putting men in the Army is retarded by the want of prompt action on applications and appeals. It will be seen from the papers forwarded that there have been three acting superintendents of this Bureau within a few days past.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

[Second indorsement.]

SEPTEMBER 6, 1864.

Referred to the Secretary of War for attention, &amp;c.

The remarks of General Bragg point out objections which seems to require action.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

[Third indorsement.]

SEPTEMBER 7, 1864.

Referred to General Preston, whose attention is asked to the strictures of General Bragg and the President's indorsement, and who is requested to report on the points suggested.
