HEADQUARTERS FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Huntsville, Ala., March 19, 1864.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Athens:

I have just received information this morning of Pensacola troops having arrived at Gadsden. Forrest will be at Somerville to-night, with what force I cannot ascertain. The force on the river in my front is very small. I am inclined to think some movement is on foot, either some of our bridges or Decatur; the latter is the most probable. I will give you from time to time all my information.

Major-General.

Brigadier General JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Commanding Detachment Fourth Division, Decatur:

I inclose an order that no doubt will cause some hardships. When person desire to go north and are poor people, you can give them transportation by railroad. If you have any unserviceable, workout stock, you can let families have a team where they have no other means of moving. Take particular pains that nothing is destroyed, and that all property left is got together and stored with some responsible party.

We desire to cover all movements, and therefore be very strict on your picket-line and allow no person to come in unless he is a refugee to join our or a negro whom we can use to advantage, except when in your judgment you can obtain some information. It is to our advantage that all these people should move as far south or north as possible.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
