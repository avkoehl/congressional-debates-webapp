MORRIS ISLAND, August 22, 1863-8 a.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

I received your dispatch stating that your attack is postponed until to-night. I think with our batteries in operation against Sumter she cannot fire a gun at you even in the daytime, if she has any to fire, which I doubt.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 22, 1863-8.50 a.m.

General GILLMORE:

It is not of Sumter that I am apprehensive, but of Moultrie and adjacent forts; but most all of Sumter's have been sent to Moultrie, which makes no difference in the fire. This I am inclined to endure rather than have a monitor ashore to defend or destroy, which would change the whole course of operations.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 22, 1863-9.10 a.m.

General GILLMORE:

Wagner is firing rapidly. I fear she will dismount some of our guns.

TURNER,

Colonel.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 22, 1863-9.40 a.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Wagner is firing very rapidly. There is great danger of dismounting our guns. What can you do to stop it?

GILLMORE,

Generel.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 22, 1863-9.50 a.m.

General GILLMORE:

I will send up some monitors at once.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 22, 1863-9.55 a.m.

Colonel TURNER,

Chief of Artillery:

Can you not keep down Wagner's fire with mortars, 30-pounders, Parrotts, and sharpshooters?

GILLMORE,

General.
