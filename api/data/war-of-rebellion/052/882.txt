HEADQUARTERS FIFTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY, September 26, 1863.

Major SINCLAIR,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Nothing has transpired here to-day of interest. Major Wharton reports to me that he has learned of a body of rebel cavalry about 3 miles from Kelly's Ferry, in the valley on the opposite side, but could not learn their number. He has burned the stockade on the farther side of the ferry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. HOBLITZELL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Comdg. Fifth Kentucky Cavalry.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH KENTUCKY CAVALRY, September 26, 1863.

Major SINCLAIR,Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: Your dispatch of the 25th, directing me to obstruct crossings, &amp;c., was received about an hour since. I have sent out a party to obstruct a place below me that can sometimes be forded, and sent instructions of a like nature to Major Wharton, at Kelley's Ferry. I have secured all boats, and have them on this side of the river, but there are but two or three. There is some difficulty in my getting dispatches from you. The one received this morning had been on another line, and I have never succeeded in getting any in less than half a day. All is quiet here. A patrol sent out yesterday morning brought news of the arrival of Quartermaster-General Meigs at Jasper. The Second East Tennessee Cavalry encamped there yesterday.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. HOBLITZELL,

Lieutenant-Colonel Fifth Kentucky Cavalry.

P. S.-About 3 miles below here is plenty of corn and fodder; the supply is short here. Had I not better move down there? It is impossible for any one to cross here, as the river is over 50 feet deep above and below me.

Respectfully,

W. T. HOBLITZELL.

MORRISTOWN, TENN., September 26, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

We have 10,000 men for duty. Have four days' rations and forage.

A large train of supplies for the Second Division has gone direct to Knoxville.

S. G. GRIFFIN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
