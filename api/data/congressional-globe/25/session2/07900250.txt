Senate.
prove it, as an overthrow of the credit sv stem, as
warmly a  he now does the separation of the Go-
vernment from the banks I tell the Senator that
the time is coming, when his present defence of the
banking system, as it is now organized, will be
considered as extraordinary as we now would re-
gard a defence of the old and exploded system of
colonial paper money He seems not to see that
the system has reached a point, where great cnatiges
are unavoidable, and without which, the whole
will explode The state of its, manhood and vigor
has passed, and it is now far advanced in lhat of
decrepitude. The w hole system n ist be reformed,
thoroughly reloimed, or it must perish in the natu-
ral course of events The first step towaids its re-
aovation is the measure he denounces m such un-
measured terms—the separation from the Govern-
ment, and the neM a separation between discount
and circuhtion The two are incompatible, and
so long as they are united, those frequent vicissi-
tudes ot contractions and expansions, to which
bank circulalion is so subject, and which is rapidly
bringing it mio discredit, must continue to increase
in frequency and intensity, nil jt shall become as
completely discredited as continental money
The Senator seems not to be enttielv unawaic of
the danger to which die s)stcm is expose\ tiom it 
frequent vibrations and catasirophes Up tells u«,
by way of apology, lhat had it not been ior the
Specie cucular the present calastiophe would not
have occuned That it hastened it, I do not in the
least doubt, but that we should have escaped with-
out it, I wholly deny The causes of the explosion
lay deep, far beneath the circular, and nothing but
the most efficient measures, during the session im-
mediately aitei the removal of the deposites, cou'd
have prevented it That was the cusís, which,
having passed without doing any Ihmg, what his
since followed \sas inevitable But admitting
what he says to be true, what a pictuie ol the sys-
tem does it exhibit1 How frail, how unstable
must it be, when a single act of the Executive
could bring it to the ground, and spread rum over
thecountiy' And shall we again lentw our con-
nection with such a %)stern, so 1 able Irem. the

clusively show that iheie is me dot p and inherent

The Senator himself ertns conscious oi this
He entered into the question ol its expansions and
contractions, and suggested several remedies to
correct an evil, which none can denj, and which
all must see, if not corrected must end in the final
oveithrow ol the system He told us lhat the le-
medy was to be fouid n the pioportion between
bullion and circulation, and ilia ihe proper rule to
enforce the due proportion between th( two was,
when exchange was against us, for th" banks to
curtail 1 admit that the di ease ongin tes m the
undue propoition, rot be «ten bullion < ml circula-
tion, but between it <u d Die liabilities < <" the binks,
inducing deposit-., as well as circulation, (ihe
foimer is even moie important than the laltei,) and
that ihe remedy must consist in enforcing that pro-
portion But two questions hen present themselves
what is that due proportion' and how is t, utidtr
oursjstemof banking, to be enforced' There is
one proportion which we know to be safe, and lhat
is, when for every dollar of liability there is one
dollar in bullion oi specie but this w< uld bung ns
back again to the old, honest, and substantial Bank
of Amsterdam, so much abused by all the advo-
cates of banks of discount It that proportion be
transcended—if we admit two, or three, to one, to
be the due proportion, or any other that would
make banking more profitable and eligible than the
mere loaning of money or oihe pursuits of societv,
the evil under whicn we now suffer would continue
Too mucn capital w ou'd continue to flow into bank-
ing, to be again followed by the evcess of the sys-
tem, with all its nam of disasters Bui admit mat
such would not be the fact, how are we to compel
the rwenty-sn States of this Union to enforce the
due pioportion, all of which exercise the right of
establishing banks at pleasure, and on such prin-
ciples as they may choose to adopt7 It can only
be done by an amendment of ¡he Constitution, and
is there any one so wild and visionary as to believe
that there is the least prospect of such au amend-
mentl Let gentlemen who ackuowledg  the de-
lect, before they insist on a reunion with a system
acknowleged to be exposed, a-s it now stands, to
such fiequent and dangerous vicissitudes, first ap-
ply a remedy and remove the delect, and then ask
for our co-operation
But the Senator tells us that the means of enforc-
ing the due propoition is to be found in the regu-
lation of the exchanges, and lor tin purpose the
only rule necessary to be obse> i ed is to curtail
when exchanges are against us, and as acountei-
part, I suppose, to enlaige When m our lavor
How ninth dependence r to be put on tins rule,
we have a strong lllutuation in the late catastrophe,
under which the country is now suffering The
exchanges lematned in out tavoi to the very last,
and before the rule, on which the Senatoi so confi-
dently relies, could be applied, the shock was felt
and the banks ingulfed, and tin  will ever be the
case, when pieceded by a gent lal expansion m the
commercial world, suth as pieceded the late
The cause of that commenced on the o'her side
of ihe Atlantic, and otiginate1 mainly in the piou-
sions on which the rccharter of the Bank ot En-
gland was renewed, which great!) favored the ex-
tension of banking optntions in a country which
may be cinsidered as the centre of the commercial
system ol ihe world The effect of these ptoviswns
was a depreciation of the value of gold and silvei
there, and their consequent expulsion to other coun-
tnes, and espeuilly to our'-, which turned the ev-
change vith 1'ngland in oui lavor, and which, m
combination with other cm s, Ihe removal ot the
deposites and the expiration ol the charter of the
late Batik of Ihe United States, wis followed by a
great coi responding expansion of our b inking sys-
tem The result of this stale ot things w as, a gnat
mcieass of the liabilitusol the banks-, compared

which is fai from being true, as 1 have already
«hown in the instance of Mr BiddlcN operation pre-
ceding the late shock In fict, it may be laid down
as a rule, that where the currency consists of con-
venible paper, resting on a gold and silver basis,
the small portion ol specie which may be required
to uphold the whole has is fluidity obstructed by so
many and such poweiful causes, as to afford no
certain cuteuon ol tht relative expansion of tie
currency between it and oilier countries, and, of
course, artoid no ceilam rule of regulating bank-
ing operations The subjee t is c ne ihit would re
quirp more tune to discuss than I can bestow on
the present occisión, but of its truth we have a
strong illustration m the state of things preceding
the late shock, when, as I have stated, the ex-
changes remained favorable, while the vast amount
ot our unpoits, and the unusual character of many
oí the articles impoi ted, clearly indicated that our
currency was relatively greatly expanded, com-
pared with those countries with which we hav«
commercial relations 
To correct the defects of the system, the Senator
must go much deeper The evil lies in its strong
tendency to increase, and that again, in the extraor-
dinary and vast advantages which are conferred on
it, beyond a 1 othei pursuits of the community,
which, if not diminished, must termmatem its utter
destruction, or an entire revolution in our social
and political system It is «t possible that the
great body of the cotnmunj ,>will patiently bear
that the currency, which ough bg the most sta-
ble of all things, should be the - iost fluctuating and
uncertain, and that, too, in defiance of positive pro-
visions in the Constitution, which all acknowledse
were intended to give it the greatest possible sta-
bility

SPEECH OF MR. ALLEN,
Of Ohio,
In the Senate of the United States, February SO, 1838
—The Independent Treasury bill, and the sub-
stitute foi it submitted by Mr Rives, being un-
eler consideration,
Mr ALLEN rose and saiel
This Government i< but fortj -nine j ears old It
is, Mr President, your junior, and lhat of many
membeis of this body, but, short as has been
its duration, it has already experienced the most
exttaoidinary political phenomenon which has
evei occutied m human affairs Itt May last, the
nation was at peace with all manhild The stive-
lal elrpnitnients oí the Government, all the organs

and appropnate functions The public revenues
hul swollen into a surplus beyond the public ne-
cessities, of forty millions of dolíais The people
weie contented, prosperous, and happy. "We were
threatt ned neither with invasion from without nor
insurrection within \ll confide'd in the public se-
cant) , all cjUietly reposed upon that confidence
And yet, in one nigh'—itt one moment, a- it wert
—the Government was suddenly stiuck down, and
the w hole frame oí society convulsed and disjointed
by the shock' The laws were rent asunder) the
revenues sei/ed, the Government left without a
dolhr, mil the 1 ibor and property ot the whole
people without a medium or standard of value,
f hm>, and then lor the fust time, was it discovered
that there existed in om midst a power independent
alike of the Government and oí the people, ie-
sp nsible to neithei, and tnumphant over both
Many a time, sir, in the histoiy e f our race,
hive civil Mstituhins been hewn de wn by ihe
sword, m my a lime have they been eflaced from
the eaith in the < It olatm^ sweep ol human pas-
sions, many a tune have thtj worn out by the fric-
tion ol their own parts, ot decayed and wasted
iway with age, butnevei, until May last, was a
Government arrested in its action, and brought to
a solemn stand, by a power wielded not by a fo-
reign enemy, nor by the Government itself, nor } et
by the people ovu whom it extended And now,
sir, what dei we behold' We ste th s powei, con-
centrated, embodied, organized, animated by a spi-
rit of rapine an 1 conquest, and having advanced to
the Cap Ol over obligations broken, rights, viola-
t d, liws mfractel, authoufy defied, we now behold
it standing incarnate- upon the floor of the Senile,
to demand a surrendti ot the affairs of the Repub-
lic into its own exclusive custody Yes and if this
ilermnd be not complied with, it the people will
not ajitcc to pay an eternal tribute to the banks, it
they will not abandon the Government of them-
selves and submit to the rule of these monopolies,
with what are they threatened'' They are threa-
tened with a punishment, " compared to which a 1
the calamities of a war with the most potent nation
of the globe, would be a blessing " Such are ihe
forebodings, such ihe language, of the Senator from
