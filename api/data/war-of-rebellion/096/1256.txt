HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 24, 1865.

Major General J. B. KERSHAW,

Commanding Division:

General Bratton was ordered to start to relieve General Corse at dark, so as to enable General Corse to cross the river to-night. If by any accident General Corse should not be ready to cross before daylight, he will have to wait till to-morrow night. It is believed, however, that there will be no difficulty in the way of his crossing to-night.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 24, 1865.

Brigadier General H. L. BENNING,

Commanding Division:

You will direct General Bratton to relieve General Corse's brigade on the right of our line to-night. General Bratton had better ride over at once and examine the ground, so as to be prepared to move promptly at dark. If an arrangement could be made to exchange tents and covering to huts with Corse's men, the comfort of the troops would be increased.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Very respectfully, yours,

General R. E. LEE,

Rumors assuming to be based on your views have affected the public mind, and it is reported obstructs needful legislation. A little further progress will produce panic. If you can spare the time I wish you to come here.
