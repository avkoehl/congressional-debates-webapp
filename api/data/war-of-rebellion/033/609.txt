Colonel J. EDWARDS, Springfield, Mo.:

Concentrate all your movable force and attack Shelby's force wherever you can find them, but keep south of him, and keep your men and horses in good condition, so as to prevent his escape into Arkansas. Send me whatever information you may have, frequently, so that I may direct the movements of troops from the north.

Springfield, Mo., October 6, 1863-11 a.m.

Colonel HARRISON:

I have just received your dispatch of the 5th in relation to your moving up toward Pineville. The enemy, if he does not divide, will be 2,000 strong; now at Carthage and trying to go into Jackson County, but will be driven back, and will try to get out again into Arkansas. That we must prevent. Follow up rapidly in his rear and give him battle whenever you can. I will leave to-day, via Greenfield three pieces of artillery and a column. Colonel Campbell is at Cassville and had Captain Stark's ammunition. I shall order him to try and get across, with a portion of it for Captain Stark to go to Newtonia. I will go from Greenfield in the direction of Lamar, and hope to form a junction with you. Keep me advised of your movements.
