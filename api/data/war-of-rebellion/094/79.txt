DALTON, GA., December 6, 1864.

Captain H. A. FORD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch received.* I telegraphed, in brief, yesterday particulars of capture of thirty men of Major Hamill's command at bridge three miles south of Tunnel Hill. The garrison, commanded by Sergt. John H. Bayly, Thirtieth Illinois Infantry, consisted of thirty men, who were surprised and captured by about fifty guerrillas. Our troops made no resistance; all conscripts except Sergeant Bayly. There is no block-house or stockade at the bridge, and in my judgment Major Hamill is much to blame in this matter. he informed me yesterday that he never visited that post. On my return I directed his new guard to throw up a defense of lags and earth, and bade them stay there and fight. You are doubtless aware that neither the post nor men there are under my command.

J. B. CULVER,

Colonel Thirteenth Michigan Infantry, Commanding.

CLARKSVILLE, December 6, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

I have information that the rebel General Lyon was crossing the Tennessee River the 4th 3,000 or 4,000 men at the bridge, said to be moving into Kentucky. I fear he may be going to Fort Donelson. The Forty-second Missouri are here on boats, and could be sent down, if you think best.

A. A. SMITH,

Colonel, Commanding.

General WHIPPLE:

Your dispatch of this date, directing the return of the Forty-second Missouri Volunteers to Fort Donelson, received. Will start immediately.

By order of William Forbes, colonel Forty-second Missouri Volunteers:
