Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,City Point:

GENERAL: Shall I send out the division, some cavalry, and pontoons to-morrow to meet General Sheridan? I can occupy the Charles City Cross-Roads, this side of White Oak bridge, that bridge also, and send the main body of my men to Long Bridge, thus covering the crossing at those approaches, and without sending any one to Bottom's Bridge at all-the latter bridge being between the two swamps, and its possession unnecessary to the purpose, besides being an ugly place to the caught in by forces approaching form the north.

Yours, respectfully,

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.
