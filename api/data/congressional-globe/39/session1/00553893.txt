1866.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
leeted that three years ago an appropriation
of $20,000 was marie to test the practicability
of cultivating and preparing liemp or flax as a
substitute for cotton, under the direction of the
Commissioner of Agriculture. This fund has
been administered by the Commissioner of Ag-
riculture with very great economy and with
very good results. Although the process of
cottonizing flax, or reducing flax to such a con-
dition that it may be spun upon cotton ma-
chinery, has not been attained, andf perhaps
from the nature of the fiber may never be at-
tainedâ€”that is a question yet to be settled-
very great improvements have been made in
the use of flax. It has been applied to many
different articles in which before U was un-
known. In some it is equal to cotton; in
some it is superior to cotton; in some it is
inferior to cotton; but from its greater cheap-
ness it produces a very valuable fabric. The
Commissioner of Agriculture states that of
the fund of $20,000 he has transferred back
$10,50Q to the surplus fund of the Treasury;
and in these days when there is a deficicncy
bill for everything, I thought that so econom-
ical an administration was deserving of honor-
able mention. I move that the communica-
tion lie upon the table.
The motion was agreed to.
