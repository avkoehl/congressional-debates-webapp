Colonel J. F. WILLIAMS,

Macon, Mo.:

I am too much indisposed to leave my room, and cannot, therefore, go to Danville. Let no time be lost in getting out militia sufficient to keep down the marauders. Arms and supplies will be promptly sent from Saint Louis, and for any immediate want make requisitions on Saint Joseph. I regret much that H. T. is on his festive pilgrimage. I did all I could to prevent it; shall forward a history of his campaigns to department headquarters.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI, Saint Joseph, Mo., June 5, 1864.

E. A. HOLCOMB,Keytesville, Chariton County, Mo.:

DEAR SIR: I am in receipt of your communication of the 3rd instant, and in reply state that I have already given orders to the troops at Macon and Brookfield, to protect you at Keytesville until you can get a company of good militia on duty. General Rosecrans has been unable to provide me with troops as he expected, and we must depend upon our militia. I will immediately order any reliable company you have in the county into active service at once. Please name them, or go to Brookfield, where you can be in telegraphic communication with me, and spend an hour with Captain Crandall at that point, who will cheerfully do all he can for you and assist permit me to do.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
