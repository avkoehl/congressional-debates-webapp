[General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:]

The cavalry party on the road by Doctor Gurley's house advanced to within about 100 yards of railroad, but were compelled to fall back again. Their position is now about half a mile from railroad; nearly same position that they had this morning. One officer thinks he could hear them repairing the railroad, but I couldn't find any one else who had heard it. The cavalry lost 1 officer and 2 men wounded and 2 men missing.
