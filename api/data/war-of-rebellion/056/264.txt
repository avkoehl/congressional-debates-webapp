Maj. General GEORGE H. THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

By directions of Brig. General M. C. Meigs, I will send a working force to Fayetteville to take up the iron from Winchester and Fayetteville Railroad, to be used for repairs on the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. It will require a guard to protect the workmen while engaged in the work. The work will commence at Fayetteville, 39 miles from Decherd. The force should be strong enough to guard the four bridges between Decherd and Fayetteville, and also to accompany the working force and to accompany the train. The guard should report at Decherd on Tuesday next, December 1.

Lieutenant Colonel J. J. PHILLIPS,

Commanding Ninth Illinois Volunteers, Athens, Ala.:

It is ascertained to a certainty that Roddey has two regiments north of the Tennessee River between Florence and Lawrenceburg. Wheeler is in about Cleveland, east of Chattanooga. The reports received concerning his movements were scarcely credited, but coming from the source they did demanded action. They are incorrect. Up to November 26 nothing except the two regiments of Roddey's had crossed the Tennessee west of Florence. Rowett is at Eastport.
