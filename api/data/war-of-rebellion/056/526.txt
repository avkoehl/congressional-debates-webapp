MEMPHIS, December 28, 1863.

General GRIERSON:

Forrest's force, unless re-enforced from below, will move south as fast as they can. Morgan should be ordered down on their line as a rallying point for your cavalry. It is said that a portion of their cavalry, with cattle, are on north side of Wolf. Has anything been heard from Smith?

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, Tennessee,

December 28, 1863.

Major General S. A. HURLBUT,

Memphis:

Mizner sent sergeant and 10 men to communicate with Smith. They went within 10 miles of Humboldt. Heard that he had come as far as Trenton and returned. Heard of him again between Paris and Huntingdon. Two scouts I sent to communicate with him made two attempts to cross Hatchie at Bolivar, drowned their horses, escaped themselves with difficulty, and returned. Two others have not been heard from since they started.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LA GRANGE, December 28, 1863-4 p. m.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

A portion of Mizner's brigade left Corinth on cars at 3 o'clock p. m. Will be here by dark. All my cavalry which were here, about 700, have been sent southwest. Will disembark Mizner here, and send him in same direction. I think the enemy will cross Coldwater at Hudsonville, perhaps at Quinn's Mill, or they may move east with the intention of striking the road again east of here.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

COLLIERVILLE, December 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General GRIERSON:

On my arrival here this morning, finding that it was impossible to communicate with you, I telegraphed to General Hurlbut my whereabouts and that of Forrest. He directed me to have my artillery sent forward and wait its arrival. I will move, however, as soon as the moon rises. I had but one hour's sleep last night and have no horse to ride, our horses being left behind.

Respectfully,

WM. H. MORGAN,

Colonel, Commanding.
