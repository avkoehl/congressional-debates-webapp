Brigadier General J. A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Your order of 10.30 a. m., to move to Rossville and La Fayette road, just received. Will carry it out immediately, I will try to communicate with Colonel Harker, but as I may fail in this would it not be well for you to try to inform him I am moving to his support.
