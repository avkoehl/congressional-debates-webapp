that your action and suggestions meet with his approval. He therefore desires that you will suspend until further orders the extension of the railroad from Blue Mountain to Jacksonville, and that you will endeavor to obtain from Governor Clark volunteers for six months instead of the militia. The reserves and volunteer State troops will be employed as suggested by you, in garrisoning the piints on our railroads, protecting supplies, and covering our lines of communication. He especially desires that an adequate garrison be sent from them to Corinth.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE WEST,Tuscumbia, November 8, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM B. WADE,

Commanding, Corinth, Miss.:

COLONEL: In reply to your dispatch of yesterday, General Beauregard directs me to say that you will prepare Corinth for a desperate against any force of the enemy which may attack it. General Roddey's cavalry will be instructed to give you all the assistance posible. Lieutenant-General Taylor will send to you all the available State reserves and volunteers which he may be able to collect. When they shall arrive you will thoroughly organize and discipline them and employ them in the defense of the place. Corinth is intended to be one of the main depots of this army. Hence, the necessity of holding it to the last extremity. You will give all the assistance possible in guarding the Mobile and Ohio and Memphis and Charleston Railroads. You will report frequently directly to these headquarters, although you will still remain under the orders of Lieutenant General R. Taylor, to whom you will also report.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
