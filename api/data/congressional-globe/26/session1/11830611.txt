Independent Treasury—Mr. Cooper.
H. of Reps.
, basis of 2,500.000. The practice oftheGovern-
meHt dorin; be  two years authorized a belief
that it would hare an average deposite of at least
tea millions—hence, in July, 1819, the circulation
«as over nine millions. But it turned out that the
deposites fell below eight millions—hence, yon see,
in the next six months, there was a contraction of
near three millions; and, for the next six months, a
a further contraction 1,500,000; and by July, 1820,
it was reduced to 3,500,000. During this time,
only eighteen months, there was a total contraction
of near near 6,000,000. The deposites decreased
4,400,000; bnt the specie increased 1,000,000.
Here, you perceive, the deposites governed the
circulation.
After this collapse, the effects of which, are in
the recollection of many, specie rose, in eighteen
months, to 7,600,000, without any corresponding
increase of circulation. Here you see 4,300,000
added to specie, and bnt 500,000 to circulation.
The reasoa wa«, deposites stood firm. Ycu see,
also, the increase of specie did not govern the cir-
culation.
In the next two years specie came down again
by precisely the $4,300,000; but this did not reduce
the circulation—on the contrary, it increased by one
million. The reason was, the deposites were
rising.
Yon here perceive, from Jan. 1820 to July 1822,
|4 300,000 came in and went out at a great ex-
pense, and did not vary the circulation $300,000—
hence, specie did not govern the circulation.
From July 1822 to Jan. 1824, deposites ranged
from 3 to $10,000,000. Circulation and specie
stood firm; almost identical. During this year and
a half, specie did govern the circulation The rea-
soa was, it was on the eve of' a Presidential elec-
tion—the contest was warm, the i sue uncertain;
and it could not be foreseen what would be the po-
licy of the successor.
But Mr. Adams was elected. Now mark the suc-
ceeding four years, and observe how well a Fede-
ral administration co-operated with its favorite Ha-
miltonian system. From January to July, circula-
tion rose two millions—specie stood firm.
From July, 1824, to July, 1825, circulation rose
near three millions, making near five millions in
eighteen month . In this time specie fell $1,800,000.
By July, 1826, circulation rose to $10 000 000,
deposites $9,700,000, and specie only $6,000,000.
From July, 1826, circulation rose to $13,600,000.
The reason was, deposites increased to $11,600,000
—specie stood firm at $6,000,000.
Here you see that for five years, from July, 1824
to'July, 1829, the circulation rose $9,000,000; the de-
posites from 4 to $6,000,000; whilst specie did not
rise or fall $500.000 on an average. For these five
years, then, the deposites governed the circulation.
From July, 1829, there^came into power an ad-
nrnistration of this Government opposed to the
Bank—Gin. Jackson. He assailed this Hamilto-
nian system with all the force of his energetic cha-
racter and unrivalled popularity.
The Bank defended, by the power of its expan-
sion and contractions. The policy of the Bank
advocates was to increase the revenue and expen-
ditures, to give the Bank the deposites. The more
revenue and expenditure, the more deposites and
the mere power.
From July, 1829, to January, '30, deposites fell
to $9,000,000. The circulation decreased also;
bnt specie increased $1,000,000. The deposites still
governed.
The Bank now discovers it must fortify itself for
a bold effort to retain the deposites—or a surren-
der, without loss of credit. It prepares for both
events. And from January, 1830, to January,
1832, the circulation ran up to almost double what
it ever had been; deposites fell to little more than
half what they had sometimes been; whilst specie
swelled $5,000,000 above any previous example.
Daring these two years, circularon
rose to                                            $21,000,000
deposites fell to             -        7,000,000
specie rose to           -             12,000,000
This was a preparation for the contest for a re-
charter, and against the removal of the deposites.
It also prepared the country for the disasters that
followed.
To sustain this unusual circulation, the deposites
are made to rise, from July 1831 till January 1833,
to $12,700,000; whilst specie fell near $4,000,000.
So that, in January, 1833, the circula*
tion was          ...      $17,500,000
do              do               deposites   12,700,000
do              do               specie          8,900,000
And this state of affairs is brought about by the
Bank with a full and fair intimation that the de-
posites would be soon demanded. With what
view the committee may judge.
After being deprived of the deposites in 1833,
the Bank was driven to supply the defect of basis
consequent upon their removal. This it did by an
increase of specie up to July, 1835—six mon'ln
before the expiration of its charter. .This was
effected by drawing on the Slate banks, or by
putting into market some of its stocks—that be-
ing the next most available means to supply a
power to redeem its notes. Drawing on the State
banks produced a contraction of the local banks,
and a panic around them, whilst the negotiation of
ijs stocks resulted in an importation of specie.
From July, 1833, to July '35, the circulation rose
higher than it ever was, to               $25,000,000
do              the depr sites fell to         1,600,000
do              the specie rose to           13,400,000
Was there ever such a state of things known in
the administration of this Bank from the begin-
ning, in 1837, to this time? Nothing like it. Here
are 15.000,000 specie and dtposites to redeem
25,000,000 of bills, and this brought about at the
very clo«e of the charter—whilst at no former pe-
riod was the circulation permitted in any material
degree to exceed the amount of the two, but most
uniformly made to correspond with one of the two.
This conductor the United States Bank can
only be equalled in wilfulness by the conduct of a
party of wild Indians of the West, who, to secure a
single buffalo, will rush a whole herd down a pre-
cipice. This, too, after using the public treasure for
twenty years as the sole governor and regulator of its
circulation. I have shown by its own returns that
the Bank supplied a currency not in proportion to
its capital, or it specie, but on'y in proportion to
the amount of money which you, as the people's
representatives, would put up and suffer it to keep.
It fed and fattened on the food you gave it; and
when you asked it for food, its reply was, work
for it, order the people to pay it to me, and I will
di. triaute it. If, at any time, your supplies grew
short, and you drew on what you had in its vaults,
you were squeezed and pressed until, to relieve
yourself, you were compelled to replenish the sto-
mach of this gormandizer, whose increasing cry
wrs, "Give! give!"
You will reo ember that this bank's capital was
$35,000,000. It is therefore evident that this did
not govern its circulation. Hence my proposition
is established, that the circulation of the United
States Bank, from 1817 to 1833, whilst it had the
Government fund , was bas*>d on and governed by
that fund, and not by its capital or its specie.
I ask you, sir, do the people understand this?
The intelligent merchant, banker, or broker may;
but the unsophisticated and honest planters, farm-
ers, and mechanics, where I live, do not. I hope
they will put their fingers on this, and feel assured
they touch the key that unlocks the grand secret of
modem banking.
From it we shall illustrate several propositions,
interesting to all who are concerned in what yon
call currency—pressure, hard times, hard money,
&c.
The proposition I have thus proven in regard
to the circulation of the United States Bank
and the public money, is true of the aggregate local
banks of the Union and their deposites, public and
private. This will appear by an examination of
the facts set fórtb in a table of the condition of the
bank^, which I hold in my hand, taken from your
documents, and published in the 1st volume of
Hazard'* Statistics, page 167.1 now give you those
lacts, to wit:
CONDENSED STATEMENT
Of the condition, at different intervals, of all the
banks in the United States.
[For the years 1838, '39, and '40, the nett circa-
lation only is given, as taken from the Treasurer'!
report of 1840.]

Arteror to 1820, the deposites are not given.
At that date they were thirty-five millions, the cir-
culation was forty-four millions, and the specie
nineteen mil ions.
In 1830, the circulation had increased near a
third, and the deposites over a third, whilst the
specie did not increase more 'han one-ninth
In 1835, the circulation rose to 103,000 000, and
the deportes 83 00f\000; specie 10 43,000 000
The next year, and ihe year sii -r, circulation
rose to 140,000,000 and 149,000 OnO, deposites to
127,000,000. Whilst th  specie was reduced
from 43 to 37 millions. This brought arbont the
supension and all our di-tress, pre>sure, hard times,
&c. The reasons why, I shall soon explain, if they
are not already mad* manifest
Here you perceive that the circulation rose to a
ruinous height, being carried up by the deposit? 
at the same time that the specie was diminished.
We expect to show hereafter, that of the
149,000,000 of circulation then out, from 30 to
40,000,000 was issued on a fa'se basis, er in other
words, on the fund of the depositors
From 1837 to '39, 43 000,000 of the deposites
were used. This produced the contraction and
pressure now felt. For it reduced the circulation
m one year 58 000,000. This was not produced
by a reduction of the specie basis, since it was di-
minished that year, only $2,500,000.
In 1839, the banks made a powerful effort to
reinstate the circulation to what it was in 1837.
To effect this, they added 10,000 000 to their specie
in one year, and carried it 45,000,000, far beyond
what it ever had been. They were unable, how-
ever, to expand beyond 107,000,000. For the de-
posites did not rise above 90,000,000 and a small
fraction.
This effort remlted in a further contraction in
the circulation of 21,000,000 from '39 to 1840.
Hence the deposites fell from 90 to 75,000,000.
Hence you perceive, sir, that what wa* true of
