granted by the War Department. Under that authority the whole number will soon be enrolled, and generally of the best young men in the State. I now respectfully ask for authority to accept and equip in like manner 25,000 additional volunteers, or such part thereof as may offer, so that when raised the entire strength will be 125,000.

I am, with high regard, your obedient servant,

E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York.

WAR DEPT., QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 29, 1861.

Honorable S. CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I am uneasy in regard to the supply of clothing for the troops. The contracts made this summer will furnish only a moderate supply. They were made with a view to the Army estimated for by direction of the War Department, 300,000 men. Congress subsequently authorized 500,000 volunteers and a regular force of about 50,000, making in all 550,000 men to be provided for.
