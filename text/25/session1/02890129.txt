APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th CoNG....lst Sess.
Mississippi Election.—Mr. Turney.
H. of Reps
there is a member on this flooi who is not prepared
to support both of those measures; and gentlemen
opposed to the administration and to this bill, are
supposed to be particularly favorable to those
Can gentlemen of the opposition then fail to see
the efiect that the defeat of this bill must have upon
those measures'? Are they sincere m desiring a de-
lay upon the duty bonds, and the allowance of
further time to the deposite banks, and } et oppose
this measure, which if defeated must necessarily
result in the defeat of both those bills1 Arc they
■willing to assume the responsibility of denying any
extension to the banks, or on the duty bonds, which
must be the inevitable consequence of refusing to
pass this bill? I apprehend, sir, that gentlemen
have not duly weighed these considerations, and
yet it would seem impossible that thry can have
overlooked the fact that, by exacting immediate
payment of the duty bonds and bank balances, not
only the secuuty or safety of the debts might be en-
dangered, but that increased pressure and distress
must be felt through all the ramifications of society,
and yet, sir, how can that result be avoided if this
bill is defeated?
But, sir, another and more weighty objection is
now urged to this bill Aftei it had been debated
nearly two days, ,t was suddenly disco\eied to be
an enemy in disguise, a scheme naught with all
oits of mischief to the country, and danger to our
institutions in short, an tncipienl step towards a
Ti easurybank,&s an cntel ing «edge tow ards a pel ma-
nent national paper currency. The changes have been
rung upon these words in all forms and shapes,
until the ear is weary of the repetition, and, like
the old United States Bank, w hich the gent'eman
from Massachusetts insisted had become a kind of
" stalking horse" in this House, sir, this idea of a
"Treasuiy bank," "a Government paper cur-
rency" has become a kind c f " stalking horse" to
this bill, winch is led in up< n this floor b\ every
speaker of tne opposition, to fngh'ea members out
of their votes in favor of this measure Now, sir,
I am as much opposed to a Tieasury bank as any
of the gentlemen who oppose this bill, and I would
go as far in opposing any measuie which would
be an incipient step towards such an institution, or
towards the establishment of an irredeemable Go-
vernment paper currency, as the most patriotic of
them, but after a very candid examination of the
subject in all its bearings, and after a careful peru-
sal oí the bill, I can rot discover the lurking dan-
gers with w 1 ich otner gentlemen seem to think it is
fraught I am not i ble to pcicene ain founda-
tion for a Treasure bank o for a rermanent Go-
vernment paper currency lurking about the hi1, or
incident to it. It is, sir, a very plain, mtell gib'e
bill, just what it purports to be on the lace of it,
and meaning nothing more than js expressed a
mere tempoi m y expedient, to enable the Treasury,
by an issue of Treasury notes, to a limited amount,
to fulfil its obligations, thus anticipating the mo-
nejs due to the Gov eminent, and at the same time
to do it witnout laying any taws or new duties
The issue of Treasuiy notes is confined to ten mil-
lions, bejond wh ch amount no issue can be made,
and to make assurance doubly sure, I will nij'-elf
propose the amendment < flered in Commit'ee
of me Whole, by the gentleman from Ma-
ryhnd, (Mr Johnson,) limiting the time within
whieh these notes shall be i sued to the first oi
June, 1S39, or some oilier shorter time, so as to
throw around the bill a'l those safeguards neces-
sary to render it, as it is intended to be, and as it
purports to be on ihe face of it, a measuie merely
tempoiary By the pissage of this bill we shall,
sir, be able to extend all reasonable indulgence lo
the Government d<4>tois, at a time when a is
not only the interest but the duty oí the Govern-
ment to do so, we shall furnish a tpmporaiy circu-
lation viInch may and will be used, not only as a
remittance to Europe, hut between the different
parts of the Union—which will have a tendency to
equalize exchanges, retain our sperie from foreisn
exportation, restoie commercial co^dence, and in
every way relieve the countrv, without injury to
the Government or danger to our institutions I
say witnout dangf r to our institutions, for really,
sir, I cannot see the least shadow of foundation for
the apprehensions of gentlemen  on   that point.

This is a measure which has before been adopted
by this Government, and without any objection as
to its constitutionality. It is no new experiment,
sir, no trifling with the supposed powers grv en us
by the Constitution, but the judicious exercise of
those powers clearly granted, and an exercise
sanctioned as well by authority of a former Con-
gress, a*, by seund discretion and a just regard for
a suffering country.
But, Mr. Speaker, before resuming my scat, I
feel bound to notice more particularly, some of the
lemarks of tha honorable gentleman from Tennes
see, (Mr. Bell ) That honorable gentleman, sir,
addressed himself to various interests in this
House—to the South and Southwest—and particu-
larly to those members whom he denominated the
Conservatives on this floor, and invited them most
earnestly to come and do battle with him on this
field, against this measure Whether he intended to
include me among the members of this latter class
I can not say, but at all events I beg leave most
respectfully lo decline his invitation altogether I
can not do battle m any such c?use or in such
ranks But the honorable gentleman says he does
not understand the course of the administration
party m this House, that he is mj stifled as to ihe
conduct of a certain portion of the party w hich he
denominates the Conservatives; that on all subjects
they go with the administration, and are uniformly
anajed on this floor m favor of the measures of
the administration, that he does not know what
to make of it, and he inquires, very significantly,
whether they have made peace, and what are the
terms, and asks to we the bond of compromise, or
to be told what is to be the future course of those
whom he calls conseivatives
Now, sir, I shall not affect to misunderstand tlas,
or doubt, whether I was one of those membeis to
whom ttk.se queries ¿ere addressed I was one of
those who voted for Thomas Allen as printer to this
House, and neither ihen nor now, here or elsewhere,
have attempted to conceal my vote on that occasion.
My reasons for that vote, I am not now called upon
to give, this is not the time or the occasion for that,
sir, but the fact, pet-haps, fum shes a sulFcientrea-
son of itself, why, I may conclude that the hono-
rable gentleman addiesses himself, in put at least,
to me Neither, sir, will I affect to misundeistand
the ultimate object of the gentleman's inquiries, and
I beg to carrj out those queries, and gn e them the
point, to vvhicn the whole seemed to tend—to arrive
rt once to thegst of the matter, which the delicacy
of the gentleman and perhaps, his disposition to
avoid bluntne-s, induced him to sijpiess—and
w Inch was no mo'e or less, than asking myself and
others, "Do you intend to act with the opposition?
will jou throw yourselves into the arms of Ihe
whigs?" I answ °r, no' and I thank the gentleman
for the opportunity he has afforded me, of answering
this question thus unequivocally and unresen edly
m the negative To my friends, no such arswer
was necessarv, but if ne or any other member of
the opposition, have supposed Uom that vote that
an) such expectation could be íairlj entertained, I
now take this ot( asion lo put a linal extinguisher
upon any such supposition m expectation. I
speak without authority as to others, and only
fir mjoflf, but I feel persuaded that I do but
speak the well-Known sentimen's of those men-
beis of the New York dclegat.on, who the
honoiable gentkmen cal's conservatives, or who
voted for Mr Allen, when I say that theie
are no tiuer friends of the present Executive on
this floor, than they a e, and none less likely to
abandin their principles oi their part} They
were elected as the friends of the present adminis-
tration, and Ihve ro doubi wi'l sustain it in all
honor and good faith For mvself, at least, I can
say that I shall do so And though Í did diffei, on
the occasion above alluded to, in the choice of a
printer, with <ome oí my political friends, and may
perhaps again have occasion to differ with some ot
them on unimportant or untsseniial punts, oi
questions of expediency merely, not involving pny
political principle, and not torching the funda-
mental principles of the democratic party, yet I fe-l
confident that I am surrounded here bj politic ú
friends, who aie too magnanimous, ?nj who have
too high a respect for personal independence and
freedom of opinion, to look upon every difference
of opinion as a diffeience of principle; who do
not consider that patty faith means parly servility;
and who will respect honest differences of apmion,
and not, as a test of party faith oi political integrity,
exact a blind and slavish obedience to every whim
or project which any or eveiy member of the party
may bring forward. I stand here, sir, as the repre-
sentative of a free constituency, to act as becomes
a freeman, and to represent my constituents faith-
fully, so far as I am able to do it. I was elected
as a friend of the administration, and by its friends;
and while I have the lienor of a seat here, it will be
no less my inclination ..han til} duty, to give to this
administra ion that honoiable and hearty suppoit,
which, from these circumstances, may be justly
expected of me. and which shall be alike consistent
with patriotism and pnnciple, and a conscientious
discharge of duty.
But, sir, the honorable gentleman from Tennes-
see asks, what ai e the terms of compromise between
the members of the democratic party on this floor?
what is the bond of union'—as though some contract
bad been drawn up and enteied into between the
friends of the administration, by which they were
enabled to act m eoncei t and harmonv m the Hous-e,
and one cou'd suppos  thithe evpected to see some
wnlten mstiument, perhaps, with the great seal of
state appended to it I can assure the gentleman
that there is no such document in existence, to my
knowledge, but should there be, he shall certainly
be gratified with a peiusal of it
But there is a bond of union, sir, between the
friends of the administration, much stionger and
moie powerful than any such wntten instrument,
and that bond of union, sir, ¡s the political princi-
ples which we hold m commen, those principles
which were charac^rist c of the last and present
administration; which w ere prornu gated by Thomas
Jefferson, which from his day to this time have dis-
tinguished the democratic republicans from their
opponents, of whatever name or description, and
have been sanctioned by the voice of the people, alid
by the dictates of justice and reason This is the
bond of union between the friends of the adminis-
tration, and this it is thct enables them to act uni-
tedly , and this, sir, is the reason why the honorable
gsn'lemen see such an uniform array on the floor of
this House, in favor of the administration's mea-
sures, and why he wi'l continue to see the same
thing «o long as tho=e measures are ¡n accordance
with those principles, and while they lend (as they
necfSspnl) must, when in "ccordance w.th those
pr nciples) fo the w<*if«irc oi the country, and the
peimanenoy of the Un > i
I tmst the mysterj is evp!a led, and that the
honorab'e geatl^-mcn w ill, hereifn r, have no diffi-
culty in comprehending the course of the friends of
the administratis, and the reason for their acting
in concert
I hope, Mr Speaker, iVt the motion to strike
out the cniclng clause will not prevail, but that
this bill, as well as the other one now befcre this
House, which 1 have before alluded to, will pass,
and that thereb} the most essential a id immediate
relief will be aftorded, (as I verilv l«heve it will,)
not only to ?n almost exhausted Treasury, but
more especially to the peop e eererally, whose
patience, I feai, is as nearl) exhausted as the pub-
lic Treasury, and who arc anx on ly looking (and
I trust not in vain) for such relic t as it is m the
power of Congtess to ?ffo u, aid such as we can
consistently grant, and which the exigency of the
times so impenojsly demands.
