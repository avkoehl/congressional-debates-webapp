HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, July 23, 1864.

General FOSTER,

Deep Bottom:

A deserter has just been brought in from your front. He says he gave you some Richmond papers. General Butler wants you to send them to him at once, and do so whenever you get a late paper. He considers this highly important.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General.

DEEP BOTTOM, VA., July 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

GENERAL: I have received no paper to-day from any deserter. I received a Richmond Sentinel this evening of the 22nd from the officer of picket who exchanged by order from Captain Davis. I never omit to forward all Richmond papers to corps headquarters. I intended to forward this by first courier in the morning. No news in it. Shall I send it to-night? My orders are that papers exchanged or taken from deserters be sent to me to be transmitted to corps headquarters.

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

General R. S. FOSTER,

Nearly all of one brigade of the Nineteenth Corps has just been ordered to report to you. Put it into position on the down-river side of Four-Mile Creek and let it intrench.

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Deep Bottom, Va., July 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

GENERAL: If there is any object in concealing the force to be encamped by Four-Mile Creek I would suggest that they be camped on Jones Neck until the works are completed, otherwise they will be in full view of the enemy. I would also suggest you would come or send your assistant to select the position you wish intrenched.

Yours, &amp;c.,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
