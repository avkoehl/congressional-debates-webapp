SEDALIA, MO., September 29, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. BROWN,

Tipton, Mo.:

GENERAL: I would respectfully report that I did not get any information of the guerrillas who went west and crossed at Dug Ford until 12 o'clock yesterday, which would have thrown me some twelve hours behind with some fifty men, with broken-down horses, and the rest of my command at that time some twenty-five or thirty miles east of me, who could not have bene concentrated before this morning. I deemed pursuit useless. I came to Sedalia, thinking I could send a sufficient force from my command, but there were not enough mounted men to do any good.

G. W. KELLY,

Major Fourth Cavalry Missouri State Militia.

All the militia that can be brought into service will be at once. I have ordered Captain Bow back to Warrensburg with one company. You should have the citizens make defenses in the town.

WARRENSBURG, September 29, 1864.

Brigadier-General BROWN,

Jefferson City:

Many citizens have double-barreled shotguns. The ammunition mostly needed is buckshot and powder. If that cannot be procured buckshot and ball cartridges will came nearest suiting. Send, if possible, fifteen sacks buckshot, two kegs rifle powder. If shot and powder cannot be procured send 3 boxes buck and ball cartridges, 100 boxes pistol percussion caps, 2 boxes navy cartridges. None here; much needed.

E. S. FOSTER,

Major, Commanding City.
