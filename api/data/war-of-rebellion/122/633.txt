ment mustered into the U. S. service, which order Colonel Stevenson did not obey, the commander-in-chief approves Colonel Stevenson's conduct.

Major-General Butler has no authority to enlist men in Massachusetts (unless for the Regular Army) excepting for those regiments which he was authorized the raise by His Excellency the commander-in-chief, viz, the Twenty-sixth and Twenty-eighth. If, therefore, the men claimed by General Butler were not enlisted in either the Twenty-sixth or Twenty-eighth Regiments, Colonel Stevenson shall not give them up. If Colonel Stevenson cannot protect and hold his men at Fort Warren, he shall immediately remove them to Camp Massasoit, Readville, and hold them until otherwise ordered.

Colonel Stevenson is charged with the execution of this order.

By the order of His Excellency John A. Andrew, Governor and commander-in-chief.
