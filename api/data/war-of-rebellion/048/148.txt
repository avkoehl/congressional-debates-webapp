Your telegram of 9.30 a.m. just received, owing to break in line. Every effort will be made to have the troops designated ready to-morrow.

The commanding general directs that you have your command in readiness to proceed to Washington to-morrow morning by railroad. You will at once notify Mr. J. H. Devereux, superintendent of the road, at Alexandria, at what points you desire to have the trains take up your troops, and the number at each place.

Your command must have five days' cooked rations. You will not wait to be relieved by other troops, but proceed to Washington the moment the trains are ready to take your command.

Please acknowledge.

The utmost promptitude and dispatch must be shown in executing this order, and the troops be kept on the march if necessary all night.
