LOUDON, October 20, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

My men are most entirely out of ammunition. Can you send some down to-night? We need ammunition for 200 Sharps rifles, caliber .56, and the balance for Burnside and Smith carbines and Enfield rifles. The battery is lost.

WOLFORD,

Colonel.

Major-General Burnside:

Your dispatch received. I thank you for your confidence. We have about 6,000 pounds of hard bread, and not so much sugar and coffee. Colonel Hoskins' command is about out. We will issue to him to-day.

I sent two regiments, as you directed, to Rogersville-the Second Tennessee Mounted Infantry and Seventh Ohio Cavalry, with Phillips' Battery.

We will get all the flour we can. Must have wagon train at Bull's Gap brought up. I have no apprehension but that we can hold the enemy with our present force.

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.

OCTOBER 20, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

The infantry and battery I sent out proceeded about 2 miles, and met a part of Colonel Wolford's command. The enemy is immediately in front in the right flank. Their numbers are known only from Colonel Wolford's reports.

My men are well in hand, and I think if they attack here I can at least hold out until supported by the force you speak of. I am by no means certain they will give battle hare, and I don't choose to fight outside of my proper defensive line.

Lieutenant WELHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

The firing heard to-day was probably at Philadelphia, where Colonel Wolford, with a brigade, is stationed. A citizen who saw a rebel force on the south side of the Tennessee River reports that they said they were Welcker's [Wheeler's?] force and the advance of Bragg's army. They were within 3 or 4 miles of Kingston. The enemy in small force appeared at Kingston to-day and fired on the pickets.
