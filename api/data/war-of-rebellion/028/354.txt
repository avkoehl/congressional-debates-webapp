HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 24, 1862-9.45 p.m (Received 11 p.m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have the honor to request that at least twenty new regiments, and, if possible, a greater number, be sent to me at once, to be incorporated with the old troops of this army. From Banks' morning report of the 20th instant, I think twenty regiments, at least, can be spared. I would be glad to have more than double that number with the least possible them with old troops than in any other manner. If there are any Michigan, Wisconsin, or Indiana troops, I would be particularly gratified to receive them. They should be sent via Sandy Hook, and ordered to report directly to these headquarters, where they will be immediately assigned. I would be glad if you would direct General Kelley to report to me in detail the number and position in his front. I am so intimately acquainted with Western Virginia that I am sure that I can be of benefit. Please inform me where General Kelley's headquarters are, and what is the extent of his command. I would be glad to render him any assistance in my powder. In the present situation of affairs there should be at least direct co-operation on the part of the commander in West Virginia and myself.

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Many weeks ago I submitted, through the proper channel, a long list of bravest, recommended for officers of the Regular Army for gallant service upon many fields of battle. I regret to say that none of these have been acted upon. Many, perhaps the most, of these officers have declined promotion in the volunteer service, feeling that they could render better service with their own commands. This is especially the case with regard to the most prominent officers of the artillery, who have persistently declined promotion in other corps, feeling that they could render better service to their country in their own. There are many captains and lieutenants in the artillery who for this reason have declined colonelcies in the volunteer service. I respectfully and earnestly urge upon you a prompt consideration of the claims of these gentlemen, and I trust that you will not fail to confer upon them the addition of rank which I have asked for them. In addition to the rewards which I have already asked, I shall have other lists to submit, but I beg you will now act immediately upon those I have already submitted.
