APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August, 1841.
Banhupl Bill—Mr. Gordon.
H. of Reps.
and likewise, tb't as to myself, I would, in otter
contempt ot all pen s to my own political fortunes,
continue, whether here as a Senator, or at home as
a Citizen, t j urge the repeal by all the means be-
coming a man con<c ous e f no other motive than
the welfare of his country, and fearless of every
th ng but the despotism which threatens it
It was hi answer to these ray remarks, then made,
that the other Senator from Kentucky [Mr Cr ay]
declared my announcement of the principle of re-
peal to be ore of violence—of civil war—and
having to d^c'ared it excluded my reply by mov-
ing to lay my motion to print tbe proceedings upon
the table And now, sir, his colleague [Mr. ¡More-
hfab] eeing the broad banner of repeal already float
mg fixm a thousand hills—seeing the multitudinous
freemen of the '-oil, fired by a love of liberty and a
dread of its less fl jcltins trom every valley to sur-
round iliu the ensign of its safety—seeing these
things, be al o afftc s to discover the bloody spec-
tre oí civil di coid in the repeal of a law, itself be-
lieved to be an outrage upon the paramount law of
the Co «.notion—dangerous in tie extreme to
the Government, and so believsd by a large part of
the people, by \vh le Sta'es of this Union, afid I ot
by them a'e-ne, but aUo by ths very President who
is to execute; thi-. la , with an oath to support tbat
Constitution s ill resting upon his heart But, sir,
the Amene in Democracy are not to be iitirnida'ed
or begui'ed in o i sunenderof a principle so e sen-
tía! to their tieedom as that of repeal. They un-
derstand you, gentlemen, tbey fully understand
why yi u atnch such vital importance to the mtan-
gibi/i y oí this charter No, they cannot bs igno-
rant cfi e reason1:, or ínsensib'e to the danger,
when the} be Wil the Federal party, in the first
moment of their power—it the expense of a <i> 1
lion to the people—'Vith a le-presenta ion basnd

under sue'i ci cur"stances as the°e, rushing to the
Capí ol in aehance of the regular session—and
here, with Hit furious baste of men fearful of al-
lowing the cc Kntry a day to teoover from the dea-
num of the recent contest, repealing every law
enacted by their predecessor"—passing in (heir
stead o her law- of the most frightful charac

and wa irteribeel as a restrant upon the

guide of my acuon, to the impassioned opinion of
6tdtesmen who, always excited by the scenes aroand
them, seldom reflect without feeling, and too often
feel more for th ms hes than for thei' comtry
But, sir, s nee the Senator from Kentucky has in
voked the authority of precedent against the prin-
ciple of repeal I, too will invoke one in its sup-
port. And here, before I proceed, that Senator
must allow me io remind him of his own active
agency in ptomotmg to the supreme Executive
power the late President of ti e TXmt°d Sutes—the
man at whose nod, when arrayed in the purple, the
whole body of the Federal party bowed submis-
sive, as to infallibility itself He will allow me,
hk'ttue, to ask whether, now when that man is no
more, and whilst the clod is yet flesh upon his
grav", one of the most d^libera'e—most solemn
acts of hi official We, is to b* denounced, not as
impolitic only but as criminal—as an act of vio-
lence—of civil discord, and that in the Senate by
the very men who planed him at the head of the
GJVernme¡l¡, If the late President wps n ht in the
vote to which I allude, then am I also right, and
the Sena'or wrong in denoincing the principle of
repeal If, on the otter hand, General Harrison
was wrong—if guilt) of havin?, as the representa-
tive of the people, violated the public füth, and
thereby periled the peace of his countiv, then
equally gmby must be that Senato for havin?,
wi h a knowledge of this crime, aided to confer the
Chief Magistracy upon h m Well, then, how
stands thf fací' Thus- On the 25th of
February, 1819, the old Bank of the United States
being in full life, and Mr Jehnson of Virsima
having submitted a resolution in the House of Re-
prese rUUves lo repeal the chai ter, General Harri-
son, as a member of the House from Ohio, upon
his oj. h, voted/or that resolution But sir, that

Here it is not on y asseited but ae eel upon—not

peop'e whose proceed ngs I presented—taken by
th'e man to whee hands tho'e Senators, with a
knowledge of the fact, aided to commit the su-
preme magistracy ofthe Republic.   Yes, sir, aided,
an t that, too, in a manner which, for the moment,
unseated the reason of men, a"d put at hazasd the
very being of this Government And shall these
S nators now turn about— hey who, when he was
alive, declared this mai the grea*e;>t and put est oi
patrio s—.Aall they, now ihat he has ceased to
live—shall they denounce as civil war, a principle
which he affirmed—% principle upon which, under
his oatb, he asted—shall thev thus blast and black-
en his memory before he is cold m his gravel No,
tbey cannot mean so to act, and if not, they must
recall a declaration which, as far as it goes, carries
these consequences with it
Yet, sir, as before, I again declare that I re t
the principle of repeal on no man's authority—on
no pieeedent or usage, bul upon the Constimtion,
upon the mheien, he inexhaustible legislative
piwer of the people, acting through the quiet me-
dium of balh t Upon these I rest it, and upon
the«e grounds I stand prepared, when the occasion
shall arise, to defend it, by whomsoever a'sailed.
And now, to conclude, 1 again repeat that J will,
on the doty this charter becomes a law, if al all, miro-
due a bill to repeal it.
REMARKS OF MR. GORDON,
Or NEW YORK,
In the House of Representatives, August 10,1841—On
the Bankrupt Bill   The first section havipg be n
read—
Mr GORDON moved to strike out the enacting
clause of ihe bill. He had no doubt that Congies,
had the power to enact a general bankrupt laws
but it did not follow, that because they had the
power it should be exercised. la 1800 a bankrupt
la  was parsed, but Congress repealed it two
years before i s f me expired, it «<"s loolced|upon
as prejudic al to ihe ngMs of the conn ry and|the
people, and from that day to this, every attempt
to enact a bankrupt law had been a failure. His
colleague, [Mr Barnard] had told them what me
evidence was that ihe people wanted this law, and
had informed them that there were five hundred
thousand bankrupts in the United States, out of the
eighteen millions of population, and that one mil-
lion were borne down and oppressed by bankrup -
cy How many of the five hundred thousand had
petitioned Congress? About fort)-five thousand.
Thus they had le s than one-temb. of the estimated
number of bankrup s This fact wis elici ed from
locuments furnished by ths chairman of heJudi
ciary Committee himself As fa as figures were
concern d, the arguo ent of his co leasue was des
titu e of fact So much for the pub i- will and
the popularity of the measure Many of the pe
tillóos which had been presented, asking th<u
bank ng incorporations might ba included, had been
enttiely ovei looked As  the constitutional ar-
gument, a bankrupt law must be unifoim Had
they such a system h re? In the first place, the
gre t farming interests, «s admitted by the gen-
t emsvi from Georgia, were excladed No matter
he w large their oankruptcy, or their means of as-
sets, t'iey could not be brought up by the power of
the cieditor Was tiat uniform? Bui this was
not the only inequa'iiy, for banks could mal e
their debtors yield up their property, and yet they
themselves were exempted fiomthe reach (f their
cieditors Was this equaluj, and a umlonn sjs
tem of bankruptcy1 It should include all debtors,
great and s «aM, and banks as well as individuals
But it ws ? said five hundred ihjusand in olveits
were writing for this measure to pass througn Con-
g>- a If the> o ved on an average one thousand
dollars eacS the a gre¿ate ame unt of debt would
be fi re hundied millions of do lar,e, and yet it was
proooftd to wipe off this immense sum by the pas
sage of the bill The aveia«e sum might be les ,
but i' invo'veil the *ame \ nnc pie. Now what eliei
the bill propose to do? Why, after a man filed
his petition, he was free, al bo„gh he d d not so
discha'ge his obligation- This Government, he
contended, was one of delegated powers, and was
established for ce-tam specific purposes, and the
Constitution expresvly provided that Congress
should pa s no ex post facto law, oi law impairing
the obligation of contrae s
The gentleman from Georgia [Mr  Nisbet] said
