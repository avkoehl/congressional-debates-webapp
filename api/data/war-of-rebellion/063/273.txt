COMMANDING OFFICER,

Train from Fort Smith:

SIR: I desire to notify you that the column on my east flank has fled precipitately across Illinois River, which was almost past fording and which now pursuit. But he cannot trouble you. Quanttrill, afraid of the forces I was concentrating on him and that were in his rear, fled south last night and crossed Arkansas in the night. My scout was on his trail at daylight, 6 miles west of Creek Agency. Captain Kaufman may still get him. The river is past fording below the mouth of Grand River, and is rapidly rising above, as is Verdigris. Grand River is past fording. You had better us on rapidly.
