Such immense number of cavalry are now being called into the field that it is impracticable to furnish them both pistols and carbines. Five hundred points will be sent to you to-day. After a few weeks the supply of cavalry arms will be increased.

GENERAL: The commanding general wishes to know what men are now in charge of Brant Island. Are they soldiers, and, if so, how many?

Reliable information has been received that there is a band of about 60 guerrillas organized and now moving along the sheer between Swan Quarter and Rose Bay, preparing to cross the mouth of Pamlico River in small boats and attack the island. Please answer as soon as possible.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
