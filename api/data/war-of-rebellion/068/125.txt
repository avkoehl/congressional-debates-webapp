the turnpike. A large steam saw-mill with a large amount of lumber, which a negro reports as belonging to the Confederate authorities, was also destroyed.

Very respectfully,

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-Since finishing the above report, the inclosed report of Colonel Plaisted was handed me.* No order was sent by me to Colonel Plaisted to "retire immediately;" that he was in danger of being flanked. On the contrary, I learn from the staff officer by whom the order spoken of in the body of my report was sent that he mart Colonel plaisted at the burnt saw-mill, bringing back his brigade. He therefore withdrew it without orders, leaving Barton's brigade without support. The saw-mill referred to by different reports was burnt under the direction of Colonel Dutton, Twenty-first Connecticut. I can well indorse what Colonel Plaisted says of Colonel Dandy, commanding One hundredth New York Volunteers, in every respect. Annexed is a tabular statement of casualties during the day's operations.

Very respectfully,

W. T. H. BROOKS,

Brigadier-General.
