At all events, neither the Government at Washington nor the military authorities of this department can be held justly censurable for merely aiding to carry out the policy of the governor of Missouri, supported by a majority of the radical party which elected him, and by all other political parties in the State. The whole question is resolved into controversies about State policy between citizens of Missouri, and can safely be left to themselves to settle.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
