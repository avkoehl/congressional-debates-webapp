APPENDIX TO THE -CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

35th Cong....2d Sess.
Report of the Copimissioner of Pensions.
Senate & Ho. of Reps;
jail perfectly secure, such is its dilapidated con-
dition. The jail was only intended to accommo-
date fifty persons. At this time there are upwards
of a hundred, of all ages, and committed for dif-
ferent degrees of crime, promiscuously crowded
into small and-damp cells. The danger of pro-
ducing some contagious disease is imminent, and
the moral depravity that must be infused into the
minds of the young and scarcely conscious crim-
inals by such intimate association with old and
hardened culprits, is educating them to be despe-
radoes and outlaws when they shall again be
turned loose upon society.
The jail in this city is unlike, if not all, at
least most of those in other places. It is a prison
not only for the retention of persons awaiting
trial, but for the punishment of the convicted.
There are in this District certain offenses not
punishable by sentence to the penitentiary, but
by confinement in the jail. It is not rightthata
person whose guilt is not established, and who
is sent to jail because he is unable to give bail
for his appearance at court, should be shut up in
the same apartment with a convict, who is con-
fined there as a punishment, by sentence of the
court. The demands of this community require
a much larger jail, not only for the sake of health,
but that apartments may be assigned according
to the ages and grades of offenses of the persons
committed. The location of the jail has long been
a cause of great objection to it. The square on
which it is situated is in the center of the city,
and is now much needed as a place of public re-
sort. The prisons of most of our large cities
are on their confines, if not beyond their limits.
I respectfully submit herewith a letter which
I received from Marshal Selden, in reply to an
inquiry I addressed him about the jail, and to
which I respectfully invite your attention.
I should be wanting in duty if I did not again
present for your consideration the utter insuffi-
ciency of the accommodations for the courts of
this District. There is no room assigned to the
criminal court to hold its sittings in; and the
judge can only hold his court by the courtesy of
the circuit court or city council. The orphan's
court occupies a small, damp room, in the base-
ment of the City Hall, and in the city's portion
of that building. The offices of the clerk of the
court and register'of wills have not room for the
safe-keeping of their valuable records. They are
very much exposed to depredators; and they are
so clustered together that if a fire were to break
out among them, they would all inevitably be de-
stroyed from their combustible nature; and the
loss such an event would entail upon this com-
munity, and even upon the Government itself,
cannot be estimated. The grand jury, in a report
made to the court at the December term, 1857,
observes " that, owing to the want of a safe and
suitable apartment, a considerable portion of the
court records are kept at this time in the open
passage leading to the clerks* and marshal's of-
fices, in the east wing of the City Hall. It must
be obvious, and experience shows, that the rec-
ords, as now exposed, are liable to be mutilated,
defaced, destroyed, or stolen by mischievous and
interested persons." The judges have repeatedly
represented the insufficient accommodations for
the courts and for the security of the judicial and
land records, and no one who will take the trouble
to visit the building can come to any other con-
clusion. The east half of the City Hall belongs
to the Government, and is appropriated to the
court and the clerk's office. By enlarging it as is
provided for in the plan of the building, ample
accommodations can be afforded for all the courts
and offices, and at comparatively but small cost.
The object is one of such great and pressing im-
portance, and so manifestly just, that I do not
believe there will be an objection to it from any
quarter, and I am therefore satisfied that there
can be no difficulty in obtaining an appropriation
for it.
The necessity for an appropriation to meet the
requirements of the fifteenth section of the city
charter, approved May 15, 1820, and of the
twelfth section of the amended charter, approved
May 17, 1848, is daily becoming more urgent.
They provide that the Government shall bear a
just proportion of the expense of opening and
improving streets and avenues in front, or adjoin-
ing to, or which may pass through or between
any of the public squares or reservations; also
set the curbstone and pave,the footways next to
the.reservations, when the corporation shall by
law direct the proprietors of lots on the opposite
side of the street to make similar improvements.
The Government and citizen, as property hold-
ers, are placed on the same footing. Each is re-
quired to make these improvements adjoining his
own property, which are customary and intended
to promote the comfort and convenience of the
whole community. It must be remembered that
this requirement is not an arrogant assumption
of power on the part of the corporation, presum-
ing to exercise jurisdiction over the Government
property; but it is a just and noble concession of
the Government, stooping to the level of individ-
ual proprietors,so far as its property is concerned.
There are a number of reservations about which
these improvements should be made, if there were
means to apply to them, and the expense in the
aggregate would amount to a large sum; but I
have deemed it advisable only to ask for a small
annual appropriation, which, in the course of a
few years, would accomplish the object without
the Government feeling the expense."
I beg leave to renew such of the recommend-
ations of my last report as have not as yet re-
ceived the sanction of Congress; and I append
hereto a statement of receipts and expenditures
for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1858.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
JNO. B. BLAKE,
Commissioner.
Hon. Jacob Thompson, Secretary of the Interior.
Report ot the Commissioner of Pensions.
Pension Office, .Yovember 1, 1858.
Sir: I have the honor to submit to you the ac-
companying tabular statements marked A, B, C,
D, E, and F, as exhibiting, in part, the opera-
tions of this bureau during the past fiscal year.
During that period 209 original Army claims
for invalid pensions have been allowed, requiring
for their payment the sum of #18,775 per annum;
thirty-five claims for increased allowances have
also been admitted for the further sum of $1,386
per annum. The whole number of this class of
pensions now on the rolls is 4,916, requiring the
annual sum of $446,485 93.
Eleven (11) original claims have been allowed
to soldiers of the Revolution for theaggregate sum
of $674 74 per annum, and in five cases theclaims
previously allowed have been increased in the
aggregate sum of $264 G5 per annum. One hun-
dred and fifty-two (152) original claims, amount-
ing to $8,354 06, and thirty-nine claims for the
increase of pensions formerly granted, for theag-
gregate sum of $2,070 35 per annum, have been
allowed under the several acts granting pensions
to the widows of revolutionary soldiers. The
number of revolutionary soldiers yet on the rolls
is 253, and the number of widows, 4,209. The an-
nual amount required for the former is $14,734 29;
for the latter, $334,450 85. The number of revolu-
tionary soldiers reported to have died during the
year is 104, and the number of widows of revo-
lutionary soldiers is 624.
Under the acts of 1836, 1848, and 1853, grant-
ing half-pay pensions to widows and orphans of
deceased officers and soldiers of the Army, 187
original claims, amounting to the sum of $13,924,
and two for increase of pension, for $72 per an-
num, have been allowed. The number of this
class of pensioners now on the rolls is 1,345,
and the amount required for them annually is
$107,029 22. The whole number of Auny pen-
sioners now on the rolls, under all the acts, is
10,723, the sum of whose pensions is $902,700 29.
The aggregate amount of arrears due at the
dates of the certificates for the foregoing admis-
sions was$104,420 70, namely: $9,119 to invalids;
$11,855 98 to revolutionary soldiers; $47,319 34
to the widows of revolutionary soldiers; and
$36,126 38 to widows and orphans under the half-
pay acts.
The number of original claims and for increase
allowed to officers, seamen, and marines of the I
Navy, is 30, calling for the annual sum of $1,485 50. |
Thirty-two (32) claims have been allowed to i
widows and orphans for the aggregate sum of
$6,696 per annum. The sum of the arrears due
at the dates of the certificate was $6,400 60. The
whole number of Navy pensioners now on the
rolls is 892, and the aggregate amount of their
stipends is $130,50] 10. - - *
The aggregate amount paid for Army and Navy
pensions in the several States and Territories,
during the fiscal year, was $1,130,369 95. This
is exclusive of the half-pay pensions adjudicated
by the Third Auditor, and also of " unclaimed
pensions," which are payable only at thp Treas-
ury of. the United States.
The act of February 20, 1847, requires that re-
mittances to pension agents shall be so regulated
as to prevent an undue accumulation of balances
in their hands. This has been done, as the sum
of the balances in their hands on 30th June last
($196,379 46) attests.
Of the total amount of expenditure by the Gov-
ernment on account of pensions, during the fiscal
year, th&sum of $59,175 32 has been absorbed in
the payment of arrears which had accumulated,
to revolutionary soldiers and their widows, ante-
rior to the adjustment of their claims. During
the fiscal year prior to your decision prohibiting
the allowance of such arrears to the representa-
tives of deceased revolutionary soldiers and their
widows, this item of expenditure was $177,845 52.
This indicates a saving to the Treasury of $118,-
670 20, in one year, by the discontinuance of a
practice which, in the opinion of the Attorney
General, had grown up without any authority of
law.
On the 3d of June, 1858, an act was passed to
renew and continue, during life or widowhood,
the half pay pensions formerly granted to certain
widows and orphans for five years. Under this-act
541 claims have been admitted up to the present
date. The amount due on them to the 4th Septem-
ber, was $46,031 15, and the amount required to
pay them annually thereafter, is $44,087. The
whole number of claims presented under thisact,
thus far, is 955. They have nearly all been ex-
amined, and those not admitted have been sus-
pended for further evidence, and the parties ad-
vised of the defects. The number of claims which,
it is estimated will be presented under this act
cannot be less than 3,000; but it may prove to be
considerably greater.
During the year ending 30th September last,
13,815 bounty-land warrants have been issued,
requiring 2,034,420 acres to satisfy them, as fol-
lows:

2 warrants for 100 acres each, making  200 acres.

This, added to the quantity reported last year,
makes the whole amount of public land granted
for military services, to the 30th September, 1858,
62,739,362 acres.
The number of bounty land claims under the
acts of 1847 and 1855, now on the suspended files
of the office, and which are constantly being called
up for reexamination at the request of the claim-
ants or their attorneys, or in consequence of the
presentation of additional evidence, is about
74,000.
Bounty land is yet due under the resolve of Con-
gress of 1776—
To one hundred and twenty-two commisbioned officers of
the different continental hues of the auny of the Revolu-
tion, amounting to  28,000 actes.
To eighteen hundred and eighty-seven non-
commissioned officers and soldiers of those
lines, amounting to   188,700 a
