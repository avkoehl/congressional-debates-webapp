Appropriation BUI—Mr. McKay.
H. of Heps.
hveat power, has interposed an objection to an appropriation
bill on the solegroun 1 of iwextravagauce. His duty in this re-
spect has been considered fulfilled, by requesting such appio-
pnaUops only as the puWic service may be reasonably expect-
ed to require. In the present earnest direction ol the public
mind to this subject, both the Executive and Leeislature have
evidence of the strict responsibility to which they will be held;
and while I am conscious ot piy own anxious ertoristo perform
with fidelity this portion of my public (unctions, it is a satis-
faction to me to be able to count on a cordial co-operation from
"At the time I entered upon my present duties, our ordinary
disbursements—without including those of the public debt, the
post office, and the trust funds in eharge of the Government-
had been largely increased by anpropriations for the removal
of the Indians, for repelling Indian hostilities, and for other
less urgent expenses, which grew out of an overflowing Trea-
sury Independent of the redemption of the public debt and
trusts, the eross expenditures of seventeen and eighteen mil-
lions/m 1834 and 1S35, had, by these causes, swelled to twenty,
ame millions, in 1SJ6; and the appropriations lor IS37, made
previously to the fourth of March, caused the expenditure to
rise to the very laiae amount of thirty-three millions. We
were enabled, during the year 1838, notwithstanding the conti-
nuance of our Indiam embarrassments, somewhat to reduce
this amount; and that for the present year (1839) wrll not, m all
probability, exceed twenty-six millions, or six millions less than
it ifds last year. With a determination, so far as depends ot 
me, to continue this reduction, I have directed the estimates for
lstu to be subjected to the severest scrutiny, and to be limited
to the absolute requirements of the public service. They will
be found less than the expenditures ol 1839, by over five mil-
lions of dollars."
From this brief, though plain, statement of facts,
it appeared that, owing to causes which are re-
ferred lo, the gross expenditures in 1837, caused
hy appropriations made before the 4th of March of
that jear, had risen to the very large amount of
#33,000,000; that, in 1838, they were somewhat
reduced; and, in 1839, they would not, prcfbably,
exceed $26,000,000; and, as there was a disposi-
tion professed on all sides to consult economy at
this time—as the state of the Treasury imperiously
required it—and as the chairman ot the Committee
of Ways and means [Mr. JonesI had informed us
that there was no increase in the various items of
the bill beyond what wa' asked for by the Depart-
ments; on the contrary, that, in some instances,
they were reduced—the probability was, that, at
the close of this session, the appropriations would
not exceed the estimates, which were about
$21,000,000: and thus would be effected, in the
space of three years, a redaction of 012,000,000
in the disbursements of the Government. Mr.
McK. thought that this fact, connected with
others, mentioned in that part of the message which
he had read, would afford to the people of the
country an assurance that the President would
heartily co operate in the practice of the most rigid
economy, and that "the expenditures would be
limited to the absolute requirements of the public
service."
Having said thus much in defence of the Presi-
dent against the charge of extravagance, he would
proceed to examine how far it could be sustained
against his predecessor; and as, in doing this, it
will be necessary to refer to facts and events com-
mon to both Administrations, whalevermay be said
in favor of Gen Jackson will necessarily enure to the
defence of the President. He trusted that alt hono-
rable men would see the propriety of this being
done, because in the accusations against those high
officers, the party which supported them were ne-
twssarily involved, and had to share, more or less,
the opprobrium which the accusation implied.
The form in which the charge was usually made,
was by instituting a comparison between the ag-
gregate annual expenditures of the last four years
of Jackson's administration and those of the four
years of Mr. Adams's term; and as the former
w«e larger than the latter, to assume the excess as
proof of extravagance. It would readily occur to
the jnost casual observer, that this mode of treating
the subject was exceedingly unfair to the Execu-
tive, without, at the same time, making allowances
for a variety of circums'anees to whiGh he would
hereafter allude. Without at all relying on the
opinion which has been advanced here, on the con-
trary- rather disclaiming it, that even in regard to
oM and well established Governments, their ex-
penses «would keep pace with the growth in popu-
lation Mid wealth, it seemed to him that the case of
the Federal. Government was a peculiar one; that
it extends over «.territory, the area of which is
constantly increasing, and a larf e portion of which
is, comparatively new, and, on which every thing
has to be created; that the number of sovereign
32
Slates has bten doubted within ihe last fifty years
—from thirteen to twenty-*ix; that three Territo-
ries are now knocking at the door for admission
into the Union; and that the population had gone
on augmenting from 3,921,426 in the| year 1790,
to 7,230,903 in 1810; to 12,866,020 in 1830; and
the census that is~now in progress will likely show
the number to be between filteen and seventeen
millions.
It would be as reasonable to expect that the
clothes made for the boy of five years old, would
fit him when he became the active and vigorous
youth of twenty, as that our youBg and growing
country should be confined to the same wants, and
requiring a stated amount only of annual expendi-
ture. It would be iound, on recurring to our past
history, that the expenditures have increased at all
periods wiih that wonderful development of our
resources, to wh ch he had already briefly alluded.
In document No. 10 of the present session, is a
table showing, among other things, the aggregate
amount of expenditures in periods of four years,
exclusive of the public debt and trust funds. From
that table he would quote the following:
1789 to 1792          -          -     $3,797,493 20
1793 to 1796          -          -     12,083,205 38
1797 to 1800          -           -    21,338,351 19
1801 to 1804           -          -     17,174,432 96
1805 to 1808          -          -    23,927,245 50
1809 to 1812          -          -     36,149,857 98
1813 to 1816          -          -   108,537,106 88
1817 to 1820          -          -    58,698,057 71
1821 to 1824          -          -    45,665,421 92
1825 to 1828          -          -     49,313,197 18
1829 to 18t2          -          -     56,249,878 08
1833 to 1836          -          -     87,130,428 08
Now, take the second term, from 1793 to
1796, when the amount of the expenditure
was 12,083,205 38; pass over the two inter-
vening terms, during the first of which we had dif-
ficulties with France; and during the second, the
retrenchments of Mr. Jefferson were operating,
and come to the fifth term, from 1805 to 1808, a
period of profound peace, and you will find that
the amount had nearly doubled—that is, they were
$23,927,245 50. Again: pass by the three next
periods, when the expenditures were affected by
the war with Great Britain, and the causes which
either preceded or followed it, and come to 1821
to 1824, and you have the same result, that is,
nearly doubled; and by pursuing the comparisons,
you will find that the increase from 1824 to 1836
is not greater than it had been before. But why
should the periods that he had passed by not be
also brought into the comparison?., Had not the
late Administration had its difficulties, domestic
and foreign? Had there not been what is famili-
arly called the Black Hawk war in 1832; (he hos-
tilities of ihe Creeks and Seminales, commencing
in 1835 and 1836; ihe disturbances among the Chero-
kees, and also among the tribes on the Western fron-
tier in 1836, all calling for larga and new appro-
priations of money, either for their suppression or
prevention? Had not that Administration a con-
troversy with Mexico, and al&o with France,
which for some time seriously threatened the peace
of the country, and made it necessary, by timely
and efficient preparation, to provide for any emer-
gency that might grow out of them? The same re
mark is applicable to the present Administration,
as the Seminoje war was left to it, and has been
prosecuted at great expense, from causes into
which he would not now inquire; and it is well
known that additional appropriations have been
rendered necetsary by the adoption of precaution-
ary measures, to preserve the peace of the country,
menaced at one time by the disturbances on the
Northern frontier, and the embarrassments grow-
ing out of the Northeastern boundary question.
• And, with a view of showing that some increase
was perhaps natural and unavoidable, he would re-
fer to a few States, whose Governments were older
than that of the Union, and whose public esta-
blishments might therefore be well supposed to have
attained greater maturity. The following state-
ment will exhibit the payments out of the respective
treasuries in the States of New York, Pennsylvania,
and North Carolina, on account of the ordinary ex-
penses:                                                     *>

The committee will recollect that this statement
does not include disbursements on account of the
public works in any of these States, the manage-
ment of which must necessarily involve considera-
ble annual expenditures, and to execute which
New York has now a debt of more than
$15,000,000, and Pennsylvania a debt of more
ihan $30,000,000.
The committee will also observe that the in-
crease in the expenses of these States took place at
the same time that the increase in the expendí-
tures of the General Government occurred, viz: in
1836, '37, and '38. He might, if it were necessa-
ry, go through with an examination of all the
States, when the same results would appear; but
he presumed that the instances mentioned would
be sufficient. It would be as well to add here, as
ia connection with what he had just said, that
eighteen States, including New York and Penn-
sylvania, had, according to the last accounts that
he had seen, an aggregate debt of $174,382,808,
contracted principally within the last few years,
and in execution of their several plana of public
policy.
And with a knowledge of all this, M. McKay
said that he would appeal to the committee and
ask them whether the mere increase in the amount
of expenditures was any proof at all of extrava-
gance, supposing that the money had been laid out
on proper objects, to which point he would hereaf-
ter speak. With a view of showing that it was
not, Mr. McKay referred to the Post Office Qe- -
partment, which supported itself with the exception
of what was required for the payment of the sala-
ries of the Postmaster General and his Assistants, •
and the 'Auditor, and the clerks employed under,
them. Here, according to the logic of the Opposi-
tion, was a clear case of extravagance, inasmuch
as the expenditures of the Department have not -
only doubled, but have been nearly trebled within
the periods selected for the comparison. But let ,
us see how the matter stands. The following state-
ment, prepared from the documents, will show the
relative means, and &ome of the details in the ad-
ministration of that Department, at the beginning
and end of a term of four years; the means being
the gross revenue of the Department and absorbed
in its expenditures, in the form either of compensa-
tion to postmasters, cost of transportation, or inci-
cidental and miscellaneous purposes connected with
the mail service.

And the revenue has continued to increase', with ,
occasional checks, produced by the general di-'.
rangement in the business of the country that
has prevailed for the lasttwo or three years; so
that in the year 1839, the amount of it yns
$4,476,638: the cost of transpeitation was $3.285,-
622, and the number of the post offices was 12,780,
and is now 13,376. The aggregate amount of re-
venue received by the Department, from 1789 to
1828, inclusive, was $25,560,335. The amount
received from 1829 to 1836, inclusive, was
$20,094,025; and adding tó the latter sum. .the re-
ceipts of the years 1837, 1838, and 1839. you
