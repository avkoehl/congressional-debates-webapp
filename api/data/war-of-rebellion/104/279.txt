HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,April 8, 1865.

Brigadier General J. BAILEY:

I am rejoiced to inform you that we have a lodgment in Spanish Fort. At 5 we commenced a terrific bombardment, and a battery of 30-pounders recently put upon our right completely flanked the enemy's left, and two brigades of General Carr's division (Third Division, Sixteenth Corps) charged gallantly on the enemy's works, captured the greater portion of two regiments, and are now entrenched within Spanish Fort. We can now begin to see the end, and one good effect will doubtless be that we can have you nearer to us, and on some duty which, if not more important to the army, may prove more agreeable to you than your present one. I will shortly send a fuller report for the admiral.

Your friend,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN.
HEADQUARTERS ENGINEER BRIGADE,April 8, 1865.

Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch announcing the lodgment in Spanish Fort is received. I rejoice with you in your success, although circumstances prevented me from being a participant, which certainly would have been a pleasure. I assure you I would be pleased to be closer to you, but am perfectly satisfied to work day and night wherever the commanding general deems best to place me. I will be prepared to forward the particulars to the admiral as soon as received.

Respectfully,

J. BAILEY,

Brigadier-General.
