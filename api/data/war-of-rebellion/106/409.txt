importance of the proposed council and how much the peace of our eastern frontier depends on the prompt action of the commissioners on the part of the United States. I would willingly make any personal sacrifice to accomplish the objects proposed, and to avert the evil consequences which must inevitably follow another postponement, but I do not feel justified, however great the necessity, in assuming powers upon so doubtful authority. To remove all uncertainty upon the subject I communicated with the Commissioner of Indian Affairs by telegraph asking for explicit instructions. I have learned that my dispatch was forwarded by the operator at Yreka on the 6th instant, and trust that the Commissioner may yet reply.

I remain, with high respect, your obedient servant,

J. W. PERIT HUNTINGTON,

Superintendent Indian Affairs.
