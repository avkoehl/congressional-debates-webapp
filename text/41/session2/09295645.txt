immediately appealed to by ninety-nine others
to yield to them. I now call the previous
question on the resolutions reported by the
majority, and the amendments pending thereto.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
Mr. CESSNA. This contest comes from
the fourth district of the State of Indiana, and
springs out of the election held for member
of Congress to represent that district of said
State on the 13th day of October, 1868. The
district embraces the counties of Fayette,
Franldin5 Hancock, Rush, Shelby, Union, and
Wayne. There were two candidates, George
W. Julian and John S. Reid. Mr. Julian re-
ceived the certificate of.election from the Gov-
ernor of the State, was admitted, and still
occupies the seat. Due notice of contest was
given by Mr. Reid, and specifications of errors
made sufficient, if established, to change the
result of said election as announced.
The averments of the contest are embraced
in nine specifications.
The first charge of the contestant is an alle-
gation that lie, the contestant, Mr. Reid, was
duly elected by a majority of legal votes cast
at said election, and not Mr. Julian.
The second and sixth specifications of the
contestant can be considered together, relat-
ing as they do to the same subject-matter, and
are as follows:
"2. Because that in Wayne county the clerk of
said county certified to the secretary of Star.e that
you had received m said county at said election
j 4,Oil votes, and that I had received 2.158; whereas
; in truth and in fact you received 4,516, while I re-
j ceived 2,804 votes for Congress, as is shown ivy the
returns of the several poil-books, tally-papers, and
abstract of the board uf canvassers of said county
of Wayne, and Sratfl of Indiana, making a differ-
ence in my behalf of 201 votes.
"6. Because the board ot canvassers ofthecounty
of Wayne illegally and without right rejected and
refused to count and certify the poll and vote ot the
south precinct ot Wayne township, in Wayne county,
which had been lawfully returned to the board of
canvassers ot said county by tfte inspector and judges
ot said precinct; rejecting and refusing to receive
1,151 votes lawfully voted at said precinct, of which
I received 766 votes and yon received 47<5 votes for
Congress."
The third specification of contestant is as
follows :
"3. Because the inspector and judges of Washing-
ton township, in Wayne county, Indiana, illegally
and without right rejected and refused to count m
my behalf certain tickets printed and voted for me
under the description of John S. Reed, which ousht
i; to have been received and countedforme underthis
!i Lame."
|: The fourth specification of the contestant
'| may be considered at the same time with the
i seventh, as they relate to the same issue,
to wit: the voting at the north poll of Wayne
township, in Wayne county.
The fifth specification is as follows :
"5. Because the judges and inspector of Clay town-
ship,"in Wayue county, Indiana, illegally and with-
out right rejected and refused to count in my bell0It
certain tickets printed and voted tor me ander the
name and description of John b. Reed, which ousht
to have been received and counted lor me under tn is
name."
The eighth specification relates to an alleged
miscount of 40 votes, improperly kept from
Reid. ill Rash county; bat as no proof appears
