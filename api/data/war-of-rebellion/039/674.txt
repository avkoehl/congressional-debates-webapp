Numbers 259. Report of Cap. Clermont L. Best, Fourth U. S. Artillery, Chief of Artillery.

STAFFORD COURT-HOUSE VA.,

May 10, 1863.

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit the following movements and operations of the artillery arm of the Twelfth Corps in the interval of their departure and return to this point:

The corps broke camp on Monday morning, 27th ultimo, one battery, in accordance with orders, moving with each of the two divisions-M, of the First New York Artillery, with the first, and Knap's (pennsylvania) battery with the Second Division. the remaining three batteries-Hampton's, K, First New York, and F, Fourth U. S. Artillery-were directed to remain and move with the corps wagon train, and subsequently joined the command at Chancellorsville on Thursday, the 30th. Up to the time of this junction I need say nothing of movements or operations of the artillery, since they were quite unimportant compared with the trying times so near at hand.

On Friday, May 1, the corps commenced a cautious movement from Chancellorsville on the Plank road toward Fredericksburg, one battery (and the same as previously mentioned) accompanying each division.

After preceding about 2 miles, the enemy was felt, evidently in some force, and commenced disputing the advance with his artillery. By direction of the general commanding, I advanced Knap's battery to a suitable point, opening a slow but effective fire; posted Lieutenant Winegar's six guns suitably, and sent back for Battery F, Fourth U. S. Artillery, which soon came up, and was posted near Knap's.

Soon after these dispositions the whole command was recalled to Chancellorsville. While retiring, the general commanding directed me to proceed to Chancellorsville, and post the corps batteries in such positions for defense against the probable following enemy as might be deemed judicious. Accordingly, I placed Knap's, Hampton's, and one section (under Lieutenant Muhlenberg) of Battery F at the intersecting point at Chancellorsville of the roads leading to Fredericksburg, and the other four pieces of Battery F with Fitzhugh and Winegar, on the rising and open ground on the Gordonsville front. Thus we had
