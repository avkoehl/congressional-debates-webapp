Lieutenant-Colonel BURKE, U. S. Army, Commanding.

SIR: I have the honor to report that in obedience to your instructions* I have had an interview with Henry M. Warfield, a prisoner at Fort Lafayette, and that he declines at present to make any application for his release on the score of health as he does not feel that he is now suffering from his confinement.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Surgeon, U. S. Army.

FORT McHENRY, October 21, 1861.

Mr. Graham has telegraphed me that Senator McKaig is unconditionally released and that a copy of the document is mailed to me. I shall not get it until 10 o'clock and Mr. McKaig wishes to go to Philadelphia early to-morrow morning. Shall I let him go?

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

RIVERSDALE, NEAR HYATTSVILLE, MD., October 22, 1861.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

DEAR SIR: Inclosed you will find a letter from one of our best Union men relative to the releasement of Mr. Claggett, a member of the late house of delegates of Maryland. His brother-in-law, the Rew. Mr. Chew, the rector of our church here, has requested my kind offices in his behalf; and as I take it for granted there is nothing very criminal in his conduct and as I do not believe he would be able if so disposed to do much injury I ask a favorable consideration of his case and if compatible with the public good, his release.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. B. CALVERT.
