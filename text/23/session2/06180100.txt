Note.—Other grades confoim to these ¡ates,
and this is the pay m first late vessels, which is
geneially diminished thiough all tin othei six
classes of vessels belonging to the British navy
Aftei Mr M had refi rred to the details of the
pay in the Bntish and French navies, and wis
pioctcding to show that in all the giades below
admiral, it was fai lower than the piesent pay in
tile Amtncaii Navy,
Mi WAT MOUG-H explained, and said those
preci dents were incoiiect, and that the gentleman
was mistaken, because that pay was increased
when in service fifty per cent , and that those
ofhccis obtained large allowances besides
Mr MANN continued, and said that he was
aware that the higher giades in the French service,
when at sea, had such increase, but none of the
lower grades The honorable gentleman has told
us nothing new Suppose I was mistaken fifty
per cent , it will be easy to add that to the pay
of those ñaues, and then you will not equal
the pay of the lowei grades in oui Navy The
honorable gentleman appends documents to his
reports foi our consideration, and then says they
aie incorrect and cannot be relied upon     Su, 1
should wish to know whether any of these doc-
uments are to be relied on, oi whether the gen-
tleman will also stultify the residue' If these
documents aie in any dcgiec woithy of ciedit,
then ha\e I proved to you the two propositions
which I have before made; and now, sn, let me
ask this House if it is prudent for us, in the dis-
cieet discharge of our duties, to pass this bill,
thus inci easing the pay to a greater extent than
has been proposed by those officers who have
had the subject under then caieful revision' I
might here pause, and ask whether the present
pay of the Navy is not now sufficiently laige'
Shall we outstnp in our career the vices and
oppressions of European anstocracies ' But, Mr.
Speakei, I have not yet spoken of the allowances
now made to our officers, which will be found to
exceed those in Euiope I have a little book,
compiled in 1832, by that most indefatigable and
valuable officei, the Secretary of the litasuiy,
while he was at the head of the Navy Depaitment,
which contains many things on this subject, not
known generally to the public The honoiable
chanman has not thought it advisable to make
this book a part of the documents to his report.
I will beg leave to lead a few paragraphs
"Allowance on bills, dtawn by commander of
' ships oi squadrons This was two and a half
'pei cent , but ceased after the 10th November,
' 1826 " I am informed that it is now established
at one pel cent , but I will not vouch for the
tmth of this If it be true, sir, the allowance
of one percent on the expenses of a three year's
cruise will sustain the dignity of a captain suf-
ficiently foi a íepublic
"Allowance for cabin furniture. Commanders
'of vessels in commission will be allowed as foi
'lows m lieu of cabm furniture:
"Commodoie of a squadion thirty dollars per
' month, captain of hne-of-battle ship twenty-five
' dollars «per month, captain of a frigate twenty
1 dollars pei month, mastei commandant in com-
' mand fifteen dollars per month, lieutenant com-
' mandmg ten dollars per month.
"The following articles aie deemed fixtures,
' and will be provided by the Government, viz
' sofas, sideboards, secretaries, book cases, cur-
' tains, carpets, wash stands, basins, covers, and
' hanging lamp foi cabin
'"Ulowance fm chamber money Two dolíais
'pei week to officeis stationed where theie are
' no quaiteis
"Allowance for detention on special duty Ten
' dolíais pei day to judges advocate who do not
' belong to the Navy, thiee dolíais per day to
' captains and masteis commandant, two dolíais
' pel day to suigtons, lieutenants, and citizens
'generally, one dollai and a half pei day to all
' others
"The following articles of furniture are allowed
'by the Navy Depaitment Commandants'
' houses (giving itcmv) six hundred and sixty-
' six dolíais, and oil cloths for passage and pailoi,
' not to exceed two dollars per yard, masteis cóm-
' m mdant's houses (giving items) thiee hundied
'and nineteen dolíais, besides Ike oil cloths,
' houses of lieutenants, sailing masters, suigeons,
'and purscis at yaids (giving items) one hun-
' dud and seventy-eight dolíais,besides hkecai-
' pets "
These, sir, are notyetall the allowances made,
but I feii f go too far into detail I will mention
fuel, candles, and stationeiy, uavel oi tianspoi-
tation, (including constiuctive journeys,) which
amount to an annual sum to each officer greater
than the people, or puhaps the Government aie
now awaie of.
Mr Speakei, (said Mr M ,) looking at all this
arraj of salaries, allowances in kind or in money,
I am constrained to call it "an abuse," for I will
not use a harshei turn It needs no comment,
and I foibeir Let us turn om attention, for a
ftw moments, to some of the geneial provisions
of tins bill, which appear to mi objectionable
By one of these provisions surgeons, ordeied as
fleet surgeons, are to have their pay increased
one half, and " when appointed to perform the
duties of surgeon geneial, his pay shall be in-
creased three fouiths " Now, sir, (said Mr
M ,) I should like to be mfoimed why it is that
we undeitake to do things foi the Navy indi-
rectly, which we do not hke to do directly and
openly' Is it necessary that there should be
concealment in any of oui objects' Why not
(said Mr. M ) piovide openly, undei laige cap-
itals, there shall be appointed a new officer m the
Navy, (as you have in the Aimy,) to be called a
suigeon general, with a salary and allowances
of $3,000' If such an officei is necessaiy to the
service, let it be understood, and the íeasons
shown for it, and is theie any doubt that it
would be favoiably considered, if those reasons
weie sufficient' If you pass this bill, (said Mi.
M ,) you will have such an officer added to the
long list now m commission, and he will have a
salary of $3,000
Again, Mi Speaker, are we about to lay the
foundation of a naval school in the establishment
of this " professoi of mathematics'" Ifso,letit
be avowed, and let us undei stand, openly and dis-
tinctly, the purpose The honoiable gentleman
[Mr. Wataiough] has reported in favor of such
an establishment I peiceive, by thatrepoit, that
we have now some schoolmasters attached to the
service. At Boston theieis one teachei stationed
upon a salary of $>981 75, besides allowances, and
he must be a gentleman of consideiable import-
ance, not addicted to labor in his vocation, for
he has not (do not be suipnsed) six pupils ' At
New Yoik there aie two " professors, and one
has $981 75, and the other $662 50, with allow-
ances, and they both have fifteen pupils • At
Norfolk, one "professor," and thnty-one pupils'
These, sir, must be rare foundations for naval
schools' But I will not now discuss whether we
ought to teach our young men how to live at the
public expense, yet, sir, this " piofessorship of
mathematics" in the- Navy may prove a germ,
on which we may ingraft an establishment to
educate favorites, in exclusion to the community
geneially, under the disguise of preparing them
for the public service, which will coirespond with
that at West Point, under the surveilance of the
officers of the Ai my Before we adopt this " pro-
fessoi," I should like to be informed how many
assistant professoi s will be necessary to enable
him to perform his duty I perceive that the
" piofessor of mathematics" at West Point has
four " assistantpiofessors,"and if the naval pro-
fessois should íequire a like numbei, we might
as well, perhaps, establish a corps of professors
under the command of a bureau, with a salary of
at least $4.51j' This naval "professor," I am
given to understand, has heretofore had a calling,
copied fiom the English, a " schoolmaster," but
we are now told that this appellation does not
now conespond with his "dignity," he being
an officer of " the Go'vernment of the United
States '" and jealous of his lank and title Now,
sir, (said Mr M ,) I have yet to learn that the
calling or occupation of a "schoolmaster" is
either deiogatory or degiadmg If it be so, then,
sir, I am obliged to confess that I have borne this
degradation in common with many other gentle-
men on this floor If, sir, we shall leave this" pi o-
fessoi," with his humble calling of a " school-
mas'er," without "gown and wig," I am inclined
to believe he will render you as much and as good
serviee as he will if you confer high-sounding
titles, which imply that he performs his duties
by deputy
There is another pro\ision (said Mi M )
which should not escape notice It contains the
principles, and has the modern objects of" brevet
rank," winch has obtained in the Army It
provides, that officers peifoimmg duties of a
higher grade shall be entitled to the pay and
emoluments of such grade If the House are
piepaied to sanction the pnnciple and practice of
" brevets " in the organization of the Navy, it is
probable we shall hear less complaint as to the
difficulties and delays of promotion Officers who
have heretofoic been contented in the perfoim-
ance of the duties assigned to their giade, will
soon, like many of your officers of the Aimy,
have two or three " brevets," and in the end the
coxswain may " pace the deck, and play the
commodore " No piovision could well be de-
vised which would prove more mischievous to
the discipline of the Navy, or destructive to its
best interests Again, sir, I had occasion to re-
mark the other day, that the second section, pro-
viding to set apart three per cent of the pay of
the officers to " constitute a fund for the relief of
