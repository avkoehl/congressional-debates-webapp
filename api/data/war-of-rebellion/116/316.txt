SAINT LOUIS, February 24, 1862.

JULIAN S. RUMSEY, Mayor of Chicago:

Detain the guard in my name till the prisoners are safety guarded. Send all officers prisoners of war to Columbus, Ohio. My ordrers in this respect have been shamefuly neglected. Raise a special police force if necessary. I have taken these Confederates in arms behind their intrenchements; it is a great pity if Chicago cannot guard ghem unarmed for a few days. No troops can be spared from here for than purpose at present.
