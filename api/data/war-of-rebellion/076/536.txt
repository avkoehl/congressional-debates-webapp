Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Ohio:

MAJOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of the letter of Major- General Schofield, and to inform him that I communicated to Brigadier- General Kilpatrick his message to him by letter this evening. There was no enemy found at the camp where they were found last night. To-day my division was posted across the road leading to Atlanta, my outposts occupying the same ground they did the day I was protecting the right flank of General Cox's division. I will not be able to picket on the line of the road until I have ascertained by reconnaissance of the country and roads this side of that road where I can post reserves so as to make the pickets safe. My pickets at the cross- roads were attacked as soon as I left this evening and driven back. I have sent seventy- five men out to a point near there with orders to advance to the cross- roads at daylight. There is another cross- roads half a mile east that will have to be picketed simultaneously in order to give security to either post. Rebel infantry were out at the cross- roads last evening.i have withdrawn my pickets from the line of Utoy Creek in the rear of General Kilpatrick's line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ISRAEL GARRARD,

Colonel, Commanding Division.
