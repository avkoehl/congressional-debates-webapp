Increase of the Army—Mr. Branson.
H. of Reps.
qtfences Norwn the Department consent to withdraw any
* art ot the  rmy destine 1 to protect the inhabitants of Florida
a-, it ib conceived that sucha movement would expose tiu Ter
ntory to the depredatiops df the savages The accounts irom
the Wes em frontier are ofa character to lender it veiy desira
ble to augment our forre there and it cannot ?ri my opinion
be diminished, in the slightest decree without danger to the
peace oí that country You will percenre from this sta etnent,
that our little army is actively and usefully employed else
wheie, and cannot be withdrawn fiom Hs present stations with
out serious injury to the public service I am coi vinred he 
ever thatn is of the last importance to place a complete foice
upon the Northern -ind Eastern frontier II e character of iho
country, and the obligations oftheGo\ef iment to maintain its
tieaty stipulations, t protecuts o*n citizens and to execute
the laws, all require thepiasence ofa regular force under the
command of prudent and okcreet officers Haiing these ob
jects m view, and awaie of the exigencies of the seivice, the
Department has recommended, most urgently, an increase of
the army, and an addit ona' numbei of regiments
I am aware, sir, that it is, or may be be said,
tnat these Canada dis urbarces are drawing to a
Close; that there is no danger of any further
trouble on that frontter, but gentlemen deceive
themselves on this "ubject, it they so believe K
the revolt in the colones is entirely suppressed, and
all further hostilities cease, still many years must
elapse, even uncer the most favorable auspices,
before that state of peace and quiet and neighborly
feeling can be rastoied which existed previous to
the recent (roubles. But I have yet to learn that
the present disaffection and struggle for a change
of Government, will be suppressed I know, sir,
that Great Britain has poured m her legions of
armed men, and almost filled the Canada  with
her chosen cohorts, ti at some fifteen thousand of
hei Choicest troops, aided by twei tv-five thousand
local militir, are now under arms in those pro-
vinces, and thPt it is expected that this «pint of
freedom (or revolt, if }cu choose to call it <o) will
speedily be crashed benpilh tne string t i of
power Srnofhe ed, for a time, it may be, Out, un-
less I greatly mistake the nature of fhit spin!, it
cannct be crushed and destroyed The maxim,
that "¡evolutions do not go backward," is not an
idle saymg There is truth and history m it Why
should we suppose that this maxim will be
falsified in this" particulai instance' The inhabi-
tants of the upper province particularly, are an
intelligent and worthy peopl" reputed to be brave
and persevering, and capable of apprecia'm" and
enjoying a free government They e'aim 'o be
actuated by ? love of liberty, and a cesire for free
government, and to be snuggling against oppres-
sion But, sir, as to the mer ts of the qua-rel, I
have nothing to say, because tha' is not necessarj
to the argument. It is sufficient for us to know
tnat such a contest was commenced, and is going
on, m a neighboring country, ■ nd knowing that,
we know that the experience of 1 itter tirres forbids
the idea that people engiged in stub, a cause cai
be completely conquered or crushed. The march
of civil liberty i>n i free government, p irtn uhrly
on this continent, is noi backv aTd, and n the con-
sidention of the present sta'e and future prospects
of tint frontier, we snould be careful ict to decei e
ourselves with the supposition that all trouble m
Canada is at an end We must take things as
they a-"e, and our policy m relation to the protec-
tion and garrisoning that frontier, should not be
based upon the supposition thnt all disturbances
there are drstined (o bp of short duration I hai e
al eadj piluded to (he proximity of our citizens on
the nmthern f-ontiers lo their Canad an neighoois,
and the facility of intercourse etc and the great
number of refugees alorg oi,r lire, all consp nrgto
enlist the sympathies, and arouse the kind!y feel-
ings of oui citizens on the frontier, in behalf of tht
patriots, and, s r, it would be strange indeed
such svmpath es were not aroused in ihe breasts of
our coumrjmen Thev would be less than free-
men, less than Republicans, if they could, vu , o t
one kirdly fetling, see a M'ugg'e going oi, in
which they supposed a quesion ot civil libertj ?nd
free government «t. in olved Sir, if 'hey were
entirely n different 'o such a conies , they would
lack that Republican spirit ind principle which
attaches men to free goieirm"nt How was it in
tie Southern and Southwestern States, when, the
Texan [evolution was in progress1 What fee it g
was excited m behail of the Texan pitnots, par i-
cularlj 11 Tennessee, unen that struggle was go as
on1—a contest, too, v hich was not on the r
immediate border-, but which was waged hui-
dreds of miles from them, and whose pioxinnty
oí territory lent no aid to tne sympathetic
feeling exhibited Tne events of that day evince
too p'aimy what feelings our owi citizens indi-
vidually entcrtun When such struggles are going
on, and they warn us also lo what dangerous and
imprope" i iterferenee such feelings may lead them
in disregarding the rights o' a neu'ral and friendly
power Brit while I would warn you of the exis-
tence of such sj mpathy, and while I would hope
that the citizens of this Repubhe nay never be so
dead and stupid ->s to have lost all feeling and
friendly regara for those who may be struggling
for free Government, yet, sir, I should most deeply
deplore" any, the slightest,interference on thei1- part,
either in word or deed, which would be inconsis-
tent with tur neutral obligations On this point I
trust that I shall not be misunderstood Our treaty
supjl itions and neutral obligations lo neighboring
and fn°ndly powets, are not only some of the mo t
sacred laws of the laid, but the s'net obscr/ance
and enfoicement of them are among our highest
duties, both nationally pnd individually, and no
considerations of sympathy, or respect for abstract
rights or free principles, should for a moment tole-
rate or excusé a few of our citizens, in the viola-
tion of duties so plain, and obligations so impera-
tive, and when it is borne m mind that their viola-
tion is not only an act of such manifest wrong to a
neighboring fnendlv nation, but tends so directly to
mvolv" our whole country m all the horrors of
war, tne sevefity of censure and condemnation can
hardly be too strong aga.nst those who would thus
'bohshly and recklessly endanger the peace and
hipp ncs  of die r own county men To possess
such fp"l'ngs of synpithy is one thine, but to ex-
r/re"s trem ty improper overt ac s of inter erenee
is another, *or which I would offer no apologv or
excuse I am aware ihai, under the present ex-
cited state of feeling on the frontier, a cool, j udi-
cious course of conduct may be difficult with some,
but I trust and believe that with the great miss of
our citizens u will not be found so I have conñ
dence to believe that a high sense of national and in-
dividual justice will actuate them, and that they will
be as ready to aid the arm of the General Govern-
ment m enforcing our neutral obligations, as I
know they will be m repelling invasion, or protect-
.ng cur own honor it necessarv
I hive thus sketched briefly the state of our
fiontiers, but I nave not advened to the northern
pnrt of the Territory of Wisconsin, and to the ne-
cessity of keeping up some mlitary force m that
Territory, particularly r>t Forts Winnebago and
Howard mi at some point on Lake Superior,
n°, r Fond du Lac A 1 rge rumbei of Ind ans
s ill remain in that Territory noith of the Wisconsin
a'id Fox rn. ers, and a force is considered ind spen-
sibh neces^ar, at those forts, as well as on Lake
Supenor
I now propose to show what amoant of force is
consuler-d necessary fur the effic ent protection or
our extend"d frontier, what number of troops is
supposed tobe needful for a peace establishment,
and íj guird and protect all the various interests of
the Repnbl c, and on this pem I must necessarily
re'y upon ihe < pinions of military rr en and others,
who have bellowed much reflection on these sub-
jects, ind v ho, from heir great e\pei erce and pe
cubar position, are supposed to kno r, or ouglu to
kmv, best, an'5 to give the most satisfactory opi-
nion a d in going ovpr this gieund, I will at ' 1,

In he fiisi p'^ce, we hive Ihe recommendation
of the Seere aiy oí War, t tne do"umetits annexed
to his last annua! leporl, showing what number of
troops h' deems necessary for a peace establish-
mer* m 'he present state of the country, and
amounting, m c- si, to 14 240, viz
For ihe forts on the Atlantic, erected, in course of
erection, and repairing   -           -           -  2 300
Foi works projected           -           -           -   1 5bo
For Western Ironlier proper           -           -   5,000
In Wi«con in, at Fons Howard and Win-
nebago, and a' Prairie du Chici -           -   1,00C
For Canadian frontier, fiom Hancock bar-
racks, Maine, to Fort Brady, at the Sault
St Mary
900
Í1.365
At points requiring protection along tfce At-
lantic coast        -                                   %¡875
14,240
In this calculation, however, it will lie observed
that only 5,600 men are assigned to the Western
frontier, (which is a much lower estimate than is
made by any other person) and only 900 for the
whole Canada frontier, which, at the present time,
is altogether too small, though, at the time the re-
port -was made on the 5th of December last, it
might have been deemed sufficient. The item of
2,875 for other pomtsfon 'he Atlantic, however, I
do not deem necessary, so that on, the whole, per-
haps, llie aggregate is sufficiently large.
General Scott's estimate, made  on the  J 9th ot
November las', as contained in his letter  ot that
date in Doc No  1<J9, is as follows
For   tne   Atlantic coast,   including;
Baton Rouge  at  the south, and
Hancock barracks at the north   -   7 regiments
For Fort Brady,   Fort Mackinaw,
Fort Howard, and Fort Winne-
bago         -           -           -           -   1 regiment.
For western frontier            -           -  8 regiments.
Making, in ail          -           - 16 regiments
Which, estimating 80 privates to a company (as
he does) with the usual quantum of officers, would
make a force, in all, of about 15,500 But in this
estimate, it will be perceived that the Northern or
Canada frontier is entirely omitted, with the excep-
tion of Fort Brady and Fort Macktnaw, and the
letter was written before any of the recent distur-
bances in the Cañadas had taken place But still
General Scott pioceeds, m that letter, to giv« an
estimate of a nroviwonal army for that frontier,
and remanís, tnat " tak ng the peace establishment
numbers as before, additional companies will be
required as follows, viz
At Fort Brady    -.....1
At Fort Mackinaw     ....       -        l
At Fort Gratiot, foot of Lake Huron                     2
At Detroit......6
At Fort Niagara        -       -       -               !~       2"
At Sackets Harbor and Oswego           -       -       8
At Lake Champlam   -       -                               10
At Maine frontier       -                                        10
Making, ir all,                               40
companies, or about 3 800 troops in the aggregate
foi that frontier—a number loo large, in mi tp mon,
but even reducing it oue-half would g-ve an «ggre-
gate of 17,400 for the whole army and in this esti-
mate it w 11 be seen that Geiv'Scott assigns 8 regi-
ments, oi nearly 8,000men, kiíne Western frontier
1 will now advert to opinion  of other military
men, as to the force necessary for the Vi" in
frontier alone
General Atkinson, under date of 22d Augus1
la*t, (document 276 ) says
For ihe protection of the Lake country, including
Gi-en Bay and Fort Winnebago, I should assign
one regiment of infantry (1,000 men)        1,000
For posts on the Upper Mississippi, one regi-
ment of infantry and two  iroops ot  dia-
goons       ..... 1,300
For posis on the Missouri rnsr, an 1 mteime-
dia'e posts on the Osage or Neosh  river,
one regiment ot infantry and eigl, tr ops of
dragoons ----- 1,800
For Arkansas and Red rivei frontier, one re-
giment of infantry and six troops of d a-
goons       .....l,g00
Fcr posts on ihe R.ed river and Saowe nve ,
two regiments of inlantry and four troops
of áragoons          .... '4,400
Making                                     8,000
This wou'd give, toi the Western frontier pro-
per, about "1,000
