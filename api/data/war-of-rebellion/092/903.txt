MACON, November 28, 1864.

Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE:

Forrest's cavalry cannot now be spared from the Army of Tennessee; moreover, it could not get here in time. Sherman is doubtless making for sea-coast at Port Royal, Ossabaw Sound, or Darien; thence to re-enforce Grant.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

AUGUSTA, November 28, 1864-7 a. m.

General JOSEPH WHEELER:

GENERAL: Yours of 12. 30 yesterday was received last night and gave me great pleasure. I trust you will be able to keep up with the enemy and press him on here. We are fully prepared for him. As soon as possible let me hear what you can learn of the movements of the main column, and endeavor to have my instructions carried out in regard to it. How is enemy provided with subsistence and ammunition?

Very respectfully and truly, yours,

BRAXTON BRAGG.

CHARLESTON, November 28, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Have you received my telegrams of the 22nd and 23rd instant asking for re-enforcements? I cannot too strongly urge my need of them. General Hardee informs me, from Savannah, that it was reported yesterday the enemy's cavalry had crossed the Savannah River twenty miles below Augusta.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, November 28, 1864.

General SAMUEL JONES,

Charleston, S. C.:

Your dispatches of 22nd and 23rd were immediately sent to the President and Secretary of War. I have no instructions from either in respect to those dispatches, and you must be as fully aware as the authorities here that there are no re-enforcements that can be sent to you.

S. COOPER.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., November 28, 1864.

General S. JONES,

Charleston, S. C.:

It is impossible to afford re-enforcements. All troops at command of department are being pressed forward to intercept enemy. You must rely on your own resources.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
