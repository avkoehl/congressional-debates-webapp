CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,

In the Field, June 24, 1864.

I. It is a common practice with the enemy to drive in our skirmishers for the purpose of intrenching themselves. It is easy to discover their intentions, as they always halt before coming up to our line of battle, when they drive our men in for this purpose. Whenever it is known that it is their intention to intrench themselves, division commanders will, co-operating with each other, re-enforce and re-establish their skirmish line in its former position.

II. During an engagement if one division is pressed by the enemy, it is incumbent upon other division commanders, if they can so do, to give assistance promptly, without waiting for orders from the corps commander, as the tide of battle might be turned while time is consumed in finding him. The above instructions refer more particularly to when we are acting on the defensive.

By command of J. B. Hood, lieutenant-general, commanding:

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
