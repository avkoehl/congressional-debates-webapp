General A. B. DYER,

Chief of Ordnance, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: Your letter of February 1 reached me here to-day; why so long delayed I cannot imagine, unless it went down to Savannah, back to New York, and thence coastwise to New Berne,&amp;c. I explain this as my silence must have seemed unpardonable. I should dislike to lose Colonels Baylor and Bues just at this time, because I do think the chances are of a speedy disbandment of a large part of this volunteer army, and officers such as these familir with the troops can save a vast amount of property to your department. The arms and artillery of this army are in fine order and I shall endeavor to see they are so kept till passed over to your arsenals. Should events next week take a different turn from what I exprect I consent that your order any competent officers to relieve Baylor and Buel. I thank you for the compliment paid me as to strategy, &c. I believe our southern winter excursions have solved the great problem.

With much respect,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

MY DEAR SIR: Yours of April 19 was laid before me yesterday, and I am pleased that you recognize in General Atkins a fair reprsentation of our army. The moment war ceases, and I think that time is at hand, all seizures of horses and private property will cese on our part, and it may be we will be able to spre some animals for the use of the farmers of your neighborhood. There now exist a species of truce, but we must stand prepared for action; but I believe that in a very few days a definite and general peace will be aranged, when I will make orders that will be in accordance with the new state of affairs. I do believe I fairly represent the feelings of my contrymen, that we prefer peace to war, but if war is forced upon we must meet it, but if peace be possible we will accept it and be the friends of the farmers and working classes of North Carolina, as well as actual patrons of
