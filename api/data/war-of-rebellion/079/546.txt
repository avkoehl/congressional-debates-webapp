NASHVILLE, TENN., October 31, 1864-6 p. m.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER, Decatur:

Report immediately whether the whole of Stanley's corps reached Athens to-day, and whether the troops have marched from Athens to Pulaski as directed. If you are fully satisfied that the enemy have possession of the ford at Elk River the garrison at Athens may be withdrawn.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, ALA., October 31, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

I donn't know anything about General Stanley's command, except General Wood's DIVISION. I don't think the balance of the corps has arrived. I understand that all of General Stanley's troops at Athens have left. I have ordered the reoccupation of Athens, by two couriers. I have no further information from Elk River than that sent you today. Please answer whether Athens is to be reoccupied or not. If it is, rations must be sent there at once.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.

DECATUR, ALA., October 31, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

A Tennessean, a deserter from Hood's army, came in this eve from Danville; states that Wheeler was there with his command; that desertions are numerous; that the Georgia regiments have almost melted away. He thinks they will have very little over 20,000 men after they cross the Tennessee River. Hood, he says, has been received and is at Courtland. Beauregard has taken command in person. I am inclined to credit this statement, as a negro soldier who escaped was positive that Hood was this side of Courtland last night. He was at the house where Hood was to get something to eat, in the negro quarters.

R. S. GRANGER,

Brigadier-General.
