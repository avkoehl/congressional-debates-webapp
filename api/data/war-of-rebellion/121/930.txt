[Inclosure.]

FORT MONROE, VA., June 20, 1866.

Major General N. A. MILES,

Commanding Military District of Fort Monroe, Fort Monroe, Va.:

SIR: I respectfully report that the health of state prisoner Jefferson Davis is very much as at my last weekly report. He does not seem to improve in muscular strength in the same ratio as before. He states that his appetite is not good and that he does not relish his food. This may be attributable to some slight febrile symptoms which showed themselves on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday last. He becomes fatigued very soon when exercising, and is nauseated on breakfasting but recovers the tone of his stomach later in the day. He still complains of broken sleep andto this attributes his want of appetite in the morning.

Your obedient servant,

GEO. E. COOPER,

Surgeon, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Richmond, Va., June 21, 1866.

Bvt. Major General E. D. TOWNSEND,

Asst. Adjt. General, War Dept., A. G. O., Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the instructions from the Secretary of War contained in your letter of the 16th instant ordering the release of Dick Turner from Libby Prison on his parole have been carried into effect. Turner was paroled and released on the 18th instant and his parole is on file at these headquarters.

I have the honor to remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED H. TERRY,

Major-General, Commanding.
