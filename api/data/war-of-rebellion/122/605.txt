WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 28, 1861.

His Excellency EDWIN D. MORGAN,

Governor, &amp;c., Albany, N. Y.:

SIR: Your communication of the 19th instant, asking for instructions in regard to regiments to cavalry, has been received. In reply, you are respectfully informed that the Department is not disposed to increase the quota of cavalry regiments from your State beyond those already authorized. The acceptance which you have given, through Adjutant-General Hillhouse, for a regimental to be commanded by Colonel James B. Swain will, of course, be organized as other regiments of your State quota; that is, under your direction, in accordance with the general orders issued from this Department.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 28, 1861.

Honorable ANDREW G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania:

The Secretary desires me to write and say that all the men now enrolled in the several companies should be, as speedily as possible, organized into regiments and sent forward to Washington. Adopt such measures as to you may seem necessary to effect the object in view. If you can give us 10,000 or 20,000 men, please do so. We need a large force to sustain contemplated movements, and I know that no efforts on your part will be wanting to maintain the present enviable reputation of Pennsylvania or to aid the Government in the efforts making and to be made to crush out this gigantic rebellion. In addition to this immediate movement the Secretary desires me to say that if you will organize four additional regiments of infantry of new recruits and the unattached companies in the State, to be placed as a brigade under General Keim, he shall, on presenting his command, be commissioned as a brigadier-general in the volunteer service of the United States. Hoping that all may be speedily accomplished, I am, with great respect, very truly, yours,

THOMAS S. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.

Very respectfully, yours,
