APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
251
35th Cong....1st Sess.
Let Justice be Done—Mr. Sandidge.
Ho. of Reps.
people were called upon to be registered, for pro-
tection against intruders, it was right. But some
of the people in Kansas objected. We will not
be registered, said they, because you who pro-
pose it are a set of swindlers. We will sanction
nothing you do. And so said their friends out-
side of if ansas. They were urged by Govern-
ment officials and ambulatory statesmen to take
part in this policy of self-protection; but they still
refused—" it shall not be done." So seven tenths
only were numbered. The people of Kanq^s,
whose names had been registered, were invited
under a most just law to go to the polls and elect
nembers to this convention. This was right, too.
But a portion of the people of that Territory said,
we will not vote. And again were they intreated
and warned that those who stayed away must
abide the action of those who should participate
in the election. But many of them turned a deaf
ear to this warning, and went not to the polls.
Theconvention assembled, and proceeded toform
a constitution. In harmony with our theory of
government, a constitution by a convention is the
embodied will of the people.
Up to this period, all Democrats were agreed.
But when a constitution had been formed, and the
convention acting as all similar conventions had
done before, in its discretion, only chose to sub-
mit one portion of it to a vote of the people, there
was for the first time a difference of opinion in
our ranks. Some of those who had strenuously
advocated the principles of non-intervention, were
not willing for the people of Kansas to regulate
their affairs in their own way. But still, there
was not much complaint, as the whole people of
Kansas, registered and unregistered, were invited
to vote upon the only question that had disturbed
the public mind, which was, whether they would
have their State to be pro-slavery or free-soil;
and again were the whole people urged to go to
the polls and vote upon this matter. About half
of them did vote—the balance stayed away; and
with that vote closed all legal action of itansas
or its people upon the constitution. The duty of
Congress to interfere for the compulsory submis-
sion of a constitution to the people, formed by
their own agents, is too ridiculous for serious dis-
cussion. Not more so, however, than would be
the assumption that this House, with its adjuncts
in legislation, could compel the people to vote. Sup-
pose, acting upon such a fanciful idea, Congress
should remand the Lecompton constitution to the
people of Kansas, and require everybody to vote;
or (as has been done in some of the States) that
a majority of all those entitled to vote should
sanction or reject it, and the Topeka men do as !
they have done heretofore, refute to vote, and '
those who voted heretofore, decline for that rea- j
yon to do it again, (a not improbable occuirence:) j
what, then, would Congress do? Or suppose a
few hundred voted for, and a few hundred against
that constitution: what should we do?
Sir, when the Territorial Legislature of Kansas
passed, by a two-third vote, the bill prescribing
the mode of election for members to the constitu-
tional convention, which had been vetoed by Gov-
ernor Geary because there was nothing in the law
requiring the convention to submit its work to the
vote of the people, the best possible evidence was
given as to what was believed to be the power of
that convention, its members being responsible
only to the people. If the Territorial Legisla-
ture could control the action of the convention in
one thing, it could in another; and might just as
well have said that the people shall not vote, as
that they should vote. The attempt, after all this,
to excuse the people for not registering and not
voting for members to the convention, because
they understood, or believed, or were assured by
Governor Walker that they would have a chance
to vote down the constitution when formed, if they
chose to do so, is too transparent even for hum-
buggery. What right had Governor Walker to
speak for that convention ? If he had but attended
to the proper duties of his place, there would not
now have been so much trouble in the land. And
I trust Congress will not seek to foll-ow an exam-
ple of interference which has already been so fruit-
ful of bitterness and contention.
This is not the first time in our history, sir,
that efforts have been made to shape things, in
the organization of a new State government, so
as to cotifoim to the supposed preferences of a
majority of Congress, and thus to avoid difficul-
ties in the effort of admission into the Union. We
have grown tired of tricks of that sort, and when
begging has failed, are not now willing quietly
to see coercion applied to effect such a purpose.
During the pendency of this constitutional move-
ment in Kansas, I have no doubt that the Presi-
dent had, and the people of every State in the
Union had, their hopes and their preferences as
to what should be done in that Territory. But
this gave no right of interference, in any way
whatever. When I and my constituents heard
that the people of Kansas had determined to call
such a convention, we rejoiced, hoping that with-
out interference from any quarter, their affairs
would be settled. We denounced, with just in-
dignation, the assumed dictatorship of Robert J.
Walker; not because he was for or against any
particular policy, but because he should presume
to interfere at all, in a matter having no connec-
tion with his duties as Governor. I had supposed
the convention would submit the constitution to
the registered voters. But whether to them, or
to all the free white male inhabitants of the proper
age, or to none at all, being a matter of their own,
in which they had ample discretionary power, it
would have been acquiesced in by me and by those
i represent. This was our position in the begin-
ning, and all the time. I was much surprised at
the submission oC any part of the constitution on
the 21st of December last, to a vote of " all the
white male inhabitants of the Territory of Kansas
in the said Territory upon that day, and over the age
of twenty-one years, for rejection or ratification."
I did believe, and believe now, that if the whole
constitution had been submitted to such a vote, the
President, nor his Governor, nor all the troops,
with artillery and bayonets at theirdisposal, could
have preserved the peace in Kansas on that day.
It would have been an invitation to all the North
and all the South to come there and make them
a constitution. An 54 inhabitant" may be of a
day's residence.
And, sir, thousands of men would have gone
there from the North, and perhaps as many more
from the South; and when they should have met
at the polls under such circumstances, having gone
for a purpose, few men would say they were for
the kind of" popular sovereignty" which would
have been then vindicated. We know well what
would have occurred, and in anticipation of it the
convention certainly acted most wisely in circum-
scribing the temptations within such narrow limits.
A word more, Mr. Chairman, and 1 have done.
I should be most reluctant to believe, nor do I
brheve, that the northern Democrats who may
vote against the admission of Kansas into the
Union, under the Senate bill—now on your table
—will so vote became of the pro-slavery char-
acter of her constitution. To believe otherwise
would be to abandon all hope of the existence of
any party in this country sufficiently catholic and
national in its principles to preserve the union of
the States. The tics of Louisiana to her sister
States are strong—peculiarly so to those in the
great basin of the Mississippi. When it has been
proposed to carry through measures whereby new
States formed out of the old Louisiana purchase
were expected to come into the Confederacy with
domestic relations dissimilar to those of my State,
I have voted for them. This I did without regard
to any home institutions which might be estab-
lished in the formation of State governments, be-
cause it was just and right to do it. And no stress
of circumstances, so long as J retain the right to
be heard in this Hall, shall deter me from voting
to admit new States, rightfully applying, formed
out of the Louisiana, or other more recently ac-
quired territory, be their constitutions pro-sla-
very or free-soil. To be governed by any other
rule of action would be subversive of all the
sound and fair principles of common justice and
equality recognized by the founders of our Gov-
ernment, destructive of all friendly relations be-
tween the people of different sections, and would
jeopard the Union itself.
Satisfied with their position in the Union, and j
the rights enjoyed, the people of my State have j
never, through any Representative here, shown j
a misappreciation of what was due to themselves j
or to others, by joining in discordant threats, or j
notes of sectional strife. Shall we, then, be now j
suspected of any sinister purpu&c if we talk of ;
danger? Ready always to make common cause
with the people of other States in the defense of
common rights, and satisfied with their and our
ability to protect such rights, under all circum-
stances, outside of Congress, the people-of Lou-
isiana will not make haste to believe that a Union
which they have ever cherishcd with so much de-
votion is to be made to conform in its policy to
sectional views and opinions. Will the Repub-
licans of the North turn this love into hatred? We
shall see.
As I have now but a moment of time left, Mr.
Chairman, I will state that I shall append to my
remarks a table of the total agricultural products
of the United States, according to the census of
1850, and of the northern and southern States;
also, a table of the foreign commerce of the United
States, and of the nine principal ports, and their
relative positions; and a comparative table of
northern and southern foreign trade; upon the
facts of which, with more time, I might have
drawn some arguments to sustain the general
views already expressed.
The waters from the Rocky Mountains and the
Alleghanics, Mr. Chairman, pouring their trib-
utary streams into the great Mississippi, have,
from the sea, built up for us iff Louisiana a coun-
try of surpassing richness and beauty, whose
every particle of fructifying alluvion claims kind-
red soil upon each hill -top and valley in that great
region. And it is our constant prayer to Him
who has kept us in the hollow of His hand, that,
as our country with the waters, so may the hearts
of all people in the nation, be flooded with a Chris-
tian charity, which shall make a delta, by.the
accretions of brotherly love, forbearance, and
good-will, to enrich their descendants to the end
of time.  
Note.—On page 176 of the Census, there is an
error in the amount of slaughtered animals.—See
correct amount on pages 173 and 174.
I have left out in table A, value of the agri-
cultural products of the United States, 1850, the
large item of $173,000,000 for " live stock over one
year old," estimated as the annual product. The
total value of all the stock is rendered in my ar-
gument. The item of $13,740,822, of home-made
manufactures, given as belonging in agriculturey
is also left out. To have included it, would have
been to increase the excess of the South, as, on
page 173 of the Census, for home manufactures,
the South is credited with $.18,635,290, and the
North with but $9,858^454.
