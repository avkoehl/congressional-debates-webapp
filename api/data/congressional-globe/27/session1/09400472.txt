this is straugo language to be uttered m the halls of <m Ameri-

«oni cieoce are to be found    It would be scouted even from the
"Parliament of Great Britain—where it 13 supposed that the
King can do no wrong—as a relic of the feudal limes    Have
we, sir, the Representatives of the people, no high prerogative
too?    Are we not chaigel with the destinies of a mighty poo
pie?   Have they not confided to our hands high, sacred, and
responsible trusts'*   Ate we not the legitimate and immediately
lesponaiblo amenta of public s< ritimem?    Do we  not come

no Omhei? '   Sir, the haughty Canute could bid the sea be
stillj but the wave? heeded not his command, and that rod of
power which is raided to awe an American Congress mto sile ice
and submission will be broken as the reed beneath the tempest
i3.lt is true, Mr fep<jaker—and "pity'tie 'Us true"—that the
President of the United otates has thought fit to exei ci e a high
prerogative—the very highest of his office—the veto power   It

AH eyes were turned to the veneiable sage who had exchanged

had the wort's of his piomise reached fbe public ear, when the

That, by the veto now under consideration and that which
was communn ated to the benate on the 16th of last month, the
President has disappointed and deceived me, 1 feel no inclina

Upon what ground waa the conclusion predicated, that Mr.
Tylei would yield his absent to the charter ol a Bank'1 11ns
question was successfully and eloquently answei ed this morn
mgby my ft lend frona Virginia, [Mr Botts ] thp opinion of
my othei friend from Virginia [Mr GilmebJ and my colleasuc
[Mr Profpit] to the contrary notwithatandmg In v, hat poai
tion was he placed at the Hairisbuig Couv ention? It is no* de
med that he went there as the fast and unwavering friend oí
Henry Clay, and, asyou mwebear&to day, lis said he wept at
hisdefeafi Was Mr Clay a Bank or ann BanV marl It in
favor of a Bank—and eveiy b\ dy knows he was—why did ftir
i ykr support mm fir the Presidency1 A distinguished b^na
tor from Virginia [Mr Rives] the other day admi ted that at
*hai convention, "a Clay man v.as a Bank man, and a Bank
man was a Clay man " Does not tlis a Vision covei the
whole ground of comrovei&y'i Mi Tylei v as a Clay man,
and therefore a Bank man—an inference le^.turate ard con
elusive
Butmyfnend fiom Vngiria, [Mr Gilmer j in the great
compass of his ingenuity, Ins sought anothei explanation '"oi
thia conduct of Mr Tyler He sa>¡3 that he was repie enui g
at theHarrifcbjig Convention his immejiate district in Vn
gima, and that his district was m favoi of Mr Clay Why,
sir, m what attitude does this place the President before the na
lion? Does it not exhibit him as having attempted to do iedi
rectly, by the nomination ol a Bank man, what he now t,ays to
do dnectly would subject him to the scorn ard contempt of
honorable men? If he then retained his previously expressed
opinion, that a Bank wa3 ui constitutional and dangerous how
c^idd hehavedesiiLt1 uj promote tue elect on oí a man whoso
course upon this subject has never bepn disguised) iso, sir,
this argument will not do it comes too late If Mr Tyler's
constituents desired him to do, a^. the Harnsburg Convention,
what ho thought would lead to a violation of the Con&Utuuon,
why did he not resign, as ht had djne when instructed to vote
(or the expunging resolution'1 Tor my own rurt—and other
gentl men may think as they pled&e—I do most firmly and
íehgiously believe that he had, at that time, adopted theconm
tutional opinions of Mi Madison, and had daei mined to abide
the fate oí the Whig party, for weal 01 wo lie certainly had
not tben dreamed of sí tnng up for himself Whethei a
' chansre has come over the spirit of his dream," time will yec
develope.
It is not alone fiom his support of Mr Clay that I deduce the
corclusion of his change of opinion on theeubjtctof 0 Bank
The most satisfactory evi knee is furnished, fiom his adoption
of the vei y language of Genual Harrison, and the ftequent en
dor3ementof his opinions What did General Haru&on sayi
Hedetaied that he ' would sign an acttochartei arotberBank,
jf it were clearly ascertained tnat the public intei est, in 1 elation
to the cohection and disbursement of ihu reverue, would mate
nallyBufia-r Without one, and there were urequivocal manifes-
tations of public opinion in us favor " Has not this necessity
now arisen? Mr Tyler his given hie Executive sanction to
the repeal of tht, deposite act and the Sub Treasury With the
public tieasuie, therefore, leltm thehand^o' the Fxecutive,
underthe actof Í789, will not the public inteiest ' ma eually
suffer" without a Bank? Are theie my other modes trian the&u
three of collecting, keeping, and disbursing the revenue True,
the President thinks that he may devise anothei plan by our
regular session m December but what, in the mean time, be
comes of the public money1? He has taken po session of nby
his own act—placing himself precisely in the same position
with General Jackson, when he cbaiged thaf gentleman wan a
usurpation of "kingly powers," bv the removal of he deposites
An extract from his speech in 1834 will explain my n earn ig
Mr Tyler said
* In answer to all these considerations we are to'd of the gi eat
power of the Bank Sir, 13 there no danger of power many other
