Major General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Captain McNeill with company has succeeded in striking the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad at Piedmont, destroying bridges, train, engines, company work-shops, &amp;c., to the amount of millions of dollars. Thirteen hundred Yankee cavalry have gone out from Winchester to intercept McNeill. I proceed with two regiments cavalry and section of artillery to relief of McNeill. Colonel George H.
