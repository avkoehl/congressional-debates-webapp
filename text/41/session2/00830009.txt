Gesejial Post Oiwicb, London,
September 22,1809.
Sib: I beg to acknowledge the .receipt of your let-
ter of od instant, and in reply to forward you copies
of the telegraph acts of 1808 and 1869, I forward,
also, copies of the evidence taken by seleot com-
mittees of tho House of Commons iu 186$ and 1860
on telegraph questions.
From these you will gain as much information as
I can at present give with respect to the existing
relations between tho Government of this country
and the telegraph companies,
I am at a loss to understand how I can have been
quoted as authority for the statement that a mile of
English telegraph costs £143 15#, In a report which
1 made in July, 1866, to the postmaster general I
showedthat the total cost for each mile of telegraphic
wire laid on Slst December. 1865, of constructing,
maintaining, and working telegraph lines for public
service from the beginning of sueh operations to the
close of the year 1865, a period of about fifteen to
sixreen years in the ease of each of the three coun-
tries, was in the United Kingdom, £61 lis. 10c/.; in
Switzerland, £65 19s. 2d.% and in Belgium £41 16s. 8d.
I ascribed the excess of cost in Switzerland over cost
m Belgium tothenacural characteristics and climate
ot Switzerland, which doubtless had increased the
difficulties and costof construction and maintenance.
1 added that the English telegraph companies had
notiiaa tho same difficulties to encounter, but that
they bad constructed and maintained several subma-
rine cables connecting tho British islands with each
other and with the Continent, and that hence, in all
probability, it was that the total cost of the English
system had so greatly exceeded tho Belgian system-
I shall he happy at any time to furnish you with
any additional information which you may require.
X am, sir, your obedient servant,
« « w IVES SCUDAMOUE.
C. C. Washburn* Esq.., La C)'0S8e, Wisconsin.
[Translation.]
Paris, January 27,1868.
Sir : I have caused to be collected, and X have the
honor herewith to transmit, the information in rela-
tion to tho telegraphic service of France which you
requested in your letter of the 30th of November last.
Tho lines have for many years embraced all the
principal placcs of the empire, and they are being rap-
idly extended to localities ot secondary importance;
and soon, it is expected, all tho cantons of the empire
will be in the enjoymentof telegraphic facilities.
1. Organization of the System.
At present the administration possesses stations in
all tho chief points in the various departments, arron-
di8$ement8, and cantons, and in many of the smaller
villages. The total cumber of stations is nearly fif-
teen nundred, besides about one thousand stations
upon the railways, employed in tho service of the
railway companies and receiving and sending also
dispatches for the public.
In proportion to tho population and extent of
country the telegraphic system of Franco is the most
extended in Europe.
In t'he principal towns of departments where the
service answers thepolitical and commorcial exigen-
cies of the general public the Government bears all the
expenses of the establishment and working of lines.
In the principal points in arrondissements, how-
over, where the service is calculated to answer the
needs of the Government and those of tho immediate
localities as well, the lines are established by the
Government and worked under its direction, but tho
offices are furnished by the local authorities.
Again, in tho chief towns of the cantons, where the
telegraph serves almost exclusively the local inter-
ests, the people of the villages contribute, on the one
hand, to the construction of the lines, and on tho
other, to thoir working. The Government, neverthe-
less, bears thegreatcrpart of the expense, undertak-
ing about two thirds of the cost of their first construc-
tion and insuring the compensation of tho operators.
To form a harmonious system these three classes
of offices are arranged as follows:
The offices of the cantons are connected with the
chief towns of the arrondissements which collect
their correspondence. The latter, in their turn, are
connected with the chief towns of the departments,
the lines from which converge to some center selected
for its importance or on account of its geographical
situation. Finally, Ihosc central termini are all
united by lines extending in every direction.
Cost per kilometer—1.600 kil.—one mile.
At the first glance this system may seem to create
a number of intermediate stations which might bo
avoided by some other arrangement. But it snould
be remarked that the great mass of dispatehes ori-
ginating at the grand centers are transmitted di rectly
to their destination, and that thenumbcrcf repeating
stations isnotincreased, exceptwhere thotelegraphis
least used for purposes of correspondence. Tho num-
ber of repetitions is besides compensated for by the
order and. regularity of transmission, so that sufficient
rapidity is attained with all desirable correctness.
Again, although admitting thosystem of successivo
centralization as aruie, the administration docs not
apply it arbitrarily; and wherever, by reason of thei
proximity or their community of interest*, a natural
current of trade is established between twopointsin
different districts, the Government provides auxil-
iarymeans of communication between them.
From this organisation it bccomos necessary to
proportion tho resources of eaehoffiee to the import-
ance of its functions.
Hence the great centers situated at long distances
from each other, and having between ihcm a con-
stant interchange of dispatches, are united by wires
of five millimeters (one and a quarter lines i in diam-
eter, offering asmall resistance to the passage of tin
current. These are supported upon poles at a dis-
tance of fifty centimeters (twenty inches) from each
other, in order to avoid the loss of current by atmo*-
j^hcrlo influences. The lines themselves are sub-
jected to active and continued surveilancc.
The chief towns of 4' arrondissements" are united
by wires, four millimeters (one line) in thickness,
placed at a distance of thirty-nine to forty centime-
ters (sixteen inches) from each other.
The **cantonal" lines, always short and often
composed of a limited number of wires, have con-
ductors of three millimeters (three quarter line) in
thickness,and do not require such assiduous attention.
The following table shows what, under these con-
ditions, is the expenseof establishing apttntfipadhno
