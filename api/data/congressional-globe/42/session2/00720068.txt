Resolved by the Senate, (the House of Represent-

bills introduced.
Mr. SUMNER asked, and by unanimotis
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S.
No. 365) to secure equal rights in the public
schoolsof Washington and Georgetown ; which
was read twice by its title.
Mr. SUMNER. I move the reference of
the bill to the Committee on the District of
Columbia, and that it be printed ; and with the
permission of the Chair I will make one obser-
vation. The bill I now have the honor of
introducing I introduced during the last Con-
gress, and after careful consideration in the
Committee on the District of Columbia I was
authorized to report it. It was on the Calen-
dar of the last Congress among the unfinished
business. I hope that the committee will be
able to report it promptly, and that the Senate
will be willing to act upon it. It is practically
to strike out the word "white " in the educa-
tional system of the District of Columbia, going
on the idea that that is the first thing to be
done in order to secure education for the
colored race ; and the example of the District
of Columbia will naturally be followed through-
out all the States where there are colored per-
sons. I hope that when the bill comes before
the Senate finally, on the report of the com-
mittee, it may be acted upon promptly.
The_ bill was referred to the Committee on
the District of Columbia, and ordered to be
printed.
