THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE:
March 11;,
a right to bring a writ of error to reverse the
judgment, provided it be unfavorable to the
United States. This bill has been prepared by
the Treasury Department and sent to the Fi-
nance Committee, with a letter from the Secre-
tary of the Treasury urging its passage. I sup-
pose there can be no objection to it.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed for a
third reading, was read the third time, and
POST ROUTE BILL.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of the bill (H. R.
jSfo. 328) to establish certain post roads. _ It
can be disposed of in fifteen minutes, and it is
important that it should be passed at this time.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the bill.
Mr. RAMSEY. I suggest that the substi-
tute only be read. The Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads have reported a substi-
tute for the bill as it came from the House of
Representatives.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The sub-
stitute only will be read, unless the reading of
the original bill is called for by some Senator.
