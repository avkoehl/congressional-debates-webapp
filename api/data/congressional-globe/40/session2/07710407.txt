The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The un-
finished business of yesterday is before the
Senate as in Committee of the Whole, being j
House bill No. 213, to suspend further reduc- i
tion of the currency. The question is on the
amendment reported by the Committee on
Finance.
The Secretary read the amendment, which
is to strike out all of the bill after the enact-
ing clause, and in lieu of the words stricken
out to insert:
That so much of the act approved April 12, I860,
entitled "An act to amend nn act entitled 'An act to
provide ways and means to supportthe Government,'
approved March 3, lSdo," as provides that the Secre-
tary of the Treasury may retire and cancel United j
States notes to the extent of 84,000,000 per month bo,
and the same is hereby, suspended until Congress i
shall otherwise provide. j
Mr. SHERMAN. I will make a very brief
statement to the Senate of the law as it now
stands and the proposed change, and a few
facts which bear on the question. On a pre-
liminary measure of this kind, which is only
intended to operate for a short time, I do not
mean to make any extended remarks.
The currency of the country now consists of
United States notes, or lawful money, and the
bank notes issued by the national banks. The
act of June 30, 1864, limits the amount of Uni-
ted States legal-tender notes to $400,000,000.
That act contains a provision in the nature of
a compact by which it is provided that in no
event shall the amount of United States notes
issued or to be issued ever exceed $400,000,000.
That is made a part of the loan act of that date,
and is in the nature of a compact so far as a pro-
vision, which is repealable like any other act
of Congress, can- be called a compact.
The national currency act of June 3, 1864,
limits the amount of notes that can be issued
under that act to $300,000,000, making the-
aggregate circulation $700,000,000; but by
the terms of the national bank act the banks
are required to keep in reserve always in their
■vaults a certain portion of their deposits and
circulation. That amount never can be less
than $150,000,000 under the provisions of the
act. From fifteen to twenty-five per cent, of
both circulation and deposits must be held as
a reserve and can only be used to pay the
outstanding notes, so that that reserve must
be maintained or can only be reduced by a
reduction of the volume of national currency
notes.
Under the act of April 12, 1866, the Secre-
tary of the Treasury was authorized to retire
and cancel any portion of the debt of the Uni-
ted States, including, as a matter of course,
the United States notes, without limitation upon
that power, except that the reduction of Uni-
ted States notes was not to exceed $6,000,000
for the next six months, and $4,000,000 a
month thereafter. Under the provisions of
this act he has proceeded to reduce the volume
of United States notes to about three hundred
 nd fifty-six million dollars.
The act of March 3,1867, passed at the close
of the last Congress, authorized the Secretary
of the Treasury to issue $50,000,000 of three
per cent, certificates. These are not legal-
tender notes, but as they may be held by the
banks as a part of their reserve they in effect
take the place of that amount of legal-tender
notes.
These are the only acts which bear on the
question now before the Senate. On the 1st
of January, 18G8, according to the statement
that has been laid or. our table within a day or
two, the amount of legal tenders outstanding
was $356,159,127; the national bank notes,
$299,103,196, making an aggregate of circula-
tion $655,263,123. There was held, however,
by the banks in reserve of United States notes,
legal tenders proper, on the 1st of October,
1867, the date of the last bank statement fur-
nished to us, $100,550,849, leavingthc total cir-
culation of the country of all kinds, exccpt the
old State bank notes, which are now so small
as to be scarcely perceptible, $654,712,274.
That is the whole amount of legal-tender
notes in the ordinary signification; but there
are certain other forms of outstanding securi-
ties, which are in the nature of currency and
are legal tenders for certain purposes. The
compound-interest notes, the residue of which
amounts to $46,244,780, are in this condition.
Then there is the fractional currency, amount-
ing to $31,597,583, which may be converted
at anytime into United States notes. Then
there are the three per cent, certificates issued
under the law I have referred to. These three
items make a total of qualified legal-tender
notes, so to speak, of $101,107,363. But of
this, there is held by the banks as part of their
reserve, which cannot be diminished except
by a diminution of the amount of bank notes,
the sum of $56,888,250, leaving $44,219,113
held by the people of this kind of securities,
mostly compound-interest notes and fractional
currency. Adding to this the amount of Uni
ted States notes and national bank notes, we
have an aggregate circulation of legal tenders
in every form of $598,931,387, or less than six
hundred million dollars.
I have a statement which shows that since
April 1, 1866, during which month the act
authorizing contraction was passed, the amount
of contraction is $140,122,898.
Mr. EDMUNDS. How is that made up?
Mr. SHERMAN. On the 1st of April, 1866,
as the Senator will find by reference to the
reports that have been laid on the table recently
contained in a paper printed on the motion of
! my friend from Missouri, [Mr. Henderson,]
the United States legal-tender notes outstand-
ing were $422,424,007. Then there were
l $8,536,900 of one and two years Treasury
I notes, and $172,012,141 of three years com-
j pound-interest Treasury notes, which were legal
tenders. Then the fractional currency was
$28,005,412. The national bank circulation
was $248,880,000, and the State bank circu-
lation $32,800,865. Adding together these
various items the aggregate circulation then
authorized and outstanding was $913,665,947,
and the amount of bank reserve then was
$193,543,649, leaving the aggregate of total
circulation among the people $720,122,898.
On the 1st of January, 1868, as the Senator
will see from the table he has before him, there
were outstanding United States legal-tender
notes to the amount of $356,159,127. The one
and two years Treasury notes were redeemed or
else past due, and therefore considered as ma-
tured debt. Of the compound-interest notes
but little over forty-six million dollars remain.
The fractional currency had increased to
$31,597,583. The national bank circulation
had increased to $299,000,000, and the State
bank circulation decreased to $4,092,153; so
that on the 1st of January last the aggregate
circulation was about seven hundred and thirty-
seven million dollars, and deducting from that
aggregate the bank reserve there was left
$679,758,540, or a diminution of circulation
since the act took effect of $140,122,898.
Mr. EDMUNDS. How much of that was
of legal tenders proper—United States notes?
Mr. SHERMAN. About sixty millions,
but as a matter of course the compound-interest
notes operated precisely like the legal tenders
or United States notes, because the compound-
interest notes were held by the banks as part
of their reserve ; and when they were paid
off the bank had either to substitute the three
per cent, certificates or the United States notes
in their place, and hold them as part of their
reserve, so that the actual contraction is about
one hundred and forty millions. These figures,
I have no doubt, can be relied upon, because I
have taken them from the official reports.
Under these circumstances the House of
Representatives, on account of the alarm that
was created by the contraction of the currency,
passed a bill in these words i
" That from and after the passaee of this act the
authority of the Secretary of the 1'reasury to make
any reduction of the currency by retiring or can-
celing United States notes shall be, and is hereby,
suspended."
The amendment proposed by the Senate
Committee on Finance does not change the
legal effect of the House bill but as the
language of that bill was so broad it was
thought it might and probably would prevent
the cancellation of defaced notes, because it
forbids any reduction of the currency. This
general language might prevent the operation
of destroying canceled notes or any operations
of that kind. The language proposed by the
•Finance Committee of the Senate is simply
to repeal or to suspend until further legislation
the authority conferred on the Secretary of the
Treasury by the act of April 12,1866, to cancel
$4,000,000 of legal-tender notes per month.
Mr. President, I do not regard this bill as
of the highest importance, because from the
statement already made to us by the Secretary
of the Treasury there can be for two or three
months to come no further reduction of the
currency. His letter was read the other day
at the desk and I will not trouble the Senate by
reading it again. It will be recollected that the
Secretary states distinctly that until Congress
takes some definite action on the subject he
will not make any reduction, that the condition
of the Treasury will not authorize him to do it.
Still, there is an uneasiness in the public mind
upon this subject, which ought to be allayed by
an act of Congress. The committee, therefore,
after full reflection, have thought it proper to
j recommend the passage of the bill of the House
of Representatives in substance as they have
sent it to us, only changing the phraseology.
Mr. MORGAN. A majority of the com-
mittee ?
Mr. SHERMAN. Yes, a majority of the
committee. I will state that this bill contem-
plates further legislation during the present
session. That is understood by all. Some
more comprehensive measures must of course
be adopted during the present session, and this
bill contemplates that, because it provides that
until further legislation there shall be no more
contraction.
Mr. President, I will now state very briefly
the reasons which, in my opinion, justify the
passage of this bill:
First. It will satisfy the public mind that no
further contraction will be made when indus-
try is in a measure paralyzed. We hear the
complaint from all parts of the country, from
all branches of industry, from every State in
the Union that industry for some reason is
paralyzed and that trade and enterprise are
not so well rewarded as they were. Many,
i perhaps erroneously, attribute all this to the
contraction of the currency—acontraction that
I believe is unexampled in the history of any
nation. One hundred and forty million dol-
lars have been withdrawn out of $737,000,000
in less than two years. There is no example
that I know of of such rapid contraction. It
may be wise, it may be beneficial, but still it
has been so rapid as to excite a stringency that
is causing complaint, and I think the people
have a right to be relieved from that.
Sccond. This bill will restore to the Legis-
lature their power over the currency, a power
too important to be delegated to any single
officer of the Government. I do not wish to
renew the discussion that occurred here two
years ago on the passage of the law of April
12, 1866; but it is still my opinion, as it has
been always, that the question of the amount
