report, as I have already supposed, Barringer's and Dearing's cavalry brigades in camp at Stony Creek Station; Beale's brigade to the left, as they suppose, near Burgess' Mill. The Weldon railroad repaired and running to Stony Creek, supplying forage to the cavalry. No supplies for any other troops are sent by that road. The projected branch from Stony Creek Station to the South Side road is not used, no rails having been yet laid. These men are intelligent, and tell me they are from Petersburg, and before leaving the enemy's lines [March 1] heard frequently from friends there. They know of no movements of troops to the south, but say the enemy is in daily expectation of an attack from us. The enemy's picket-line is along the Rowanty Creek.
