The present magazine is not yet completed. From the drip and moisture falling from the superincumbent earth, it will be a week or more before powder can be stored. The magazine door to the 6.40 Brooke gun needs cover from the enemy's fire. The carriage to this piece is new, but the chassis rear wheels do not rest upon the traverse circle, as the screws of the lunette come in contact with the pintle plate.

As all of our carpenter work must be done by "square rule," it is necessary that al castings from arsenals be exact in patterns, otherwise there must be great delay in placing guns in position. In connection with this, I will mention that out of five pintle plates inspected this morning from the Charleston Arsenal there was a difference of one-half inch in thickness. Also, that the pintles from the Charleston Arsenal have the lower part tapering for one-half the length, while those from Macon, Ga., are cylinders.

Battery Simkins has been active for nearly two months. The two 8-inch guns now in it have their carriages badly shaken, and must soon be condemned. They are without eccentric wheels now. The two mortars are in good order. No shell at the post.

I herewith append a schedule of the maximum expenditures for these guns and two mortars bearing upon Morris Island from the above batteries, as a criterion for data of daily supplies when the fire is at intervals of five and ten minutes of each gun and mortar, respectively.

Per diem.

10-inch mortar shells...................................... 144

Cannon powder............................... pounds ....... 400

Rifle powder................................ do ........... 50

8-inch shells.............................................. 400

Brooke gun (44)............................................ 84

Friction tubes............................................. 650

Fuses, mortar.............................................. 144

Fuses, paper............................................... 500

Tallow...................................... pounds ....... 10

Oil for lanterns............................ quarts ....... 2

Fuse plugs................................................. 100

Sabots and straps.......................................... 100

Tacks....................................... ounce ........ 1

8-inch cartridge bags...................................... 400

6-pound cartridge bags..................................... 84

Twine....................................... pound ........ 1/2

Magazine lanterns on hand.................................. 4

Skids are very much needed for mounting ordnance. I would recommend 8 by 14, in place of 12 by 12, and that these be squared out by working parties in the wood near the batteries.

All of which is most respectfully submitted.
