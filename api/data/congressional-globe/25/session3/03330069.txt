THE PRESIDENT S A%\UAL MLSSAGE
SPEECH OF HON SAM CUSHMAN,
of ivb.w hampshire,
In the House of Rlpreslnt vtives,
January 2, 1839
The Hou<?e being in the Committee of the Whole
on  the state of the Union, on the motion  to
lefer the various topics embraced m the annual
message of the President—
Mi   CUSHMAN addiessed the committee as
follows
Mr Cbuxman   It ¡s with extreme regret that
I take the floor to address the House upon the
subject now under consideration     When  1 call
to  mind  the shortness of the session, together
with the gieat amount of public business now on
the Calendai of this House, which ought to re
cene the immediate action of Congress, nothing,
«u, but the harsh and unjust attack which  has
been made upon the Admmistiation, and particu
laily upon the charactei of the S-cretary of the
lieasury, could induce me to trespass upon the
time of  the  House lor  a single  moment     Mr  I
Woodbuiy is my neighbor, my townsman, my
pusotnl and political fuend, and oneot the favor
ite sms of the ¡state of JNcw Hampshire     Being
thus cinnected with  that gentleman, and know-
ng, as Í do, the purity of hi  chaiftet, and how
highly he is esteemed by the people of his native !
State, whom I have the honor, in pait, to repre
sent, 1 sno ild be faithless to my duty diJ  I  not i
tepel the chaiges which  have so wantonly been '
made against that distinguished public officer
1 he very extraordinary attempt which has re
cently been made to injure the character of Mr
Woodbuiy, will, I presume, prove wholly abor-
tive     I cannot believe that the reputation of any
man, whose whole course of life has been one of
unuiteimpttd brilliancy, is to be destroyed   by a
single bieath of an      For a long series of years
his wJtks have stood forth  in bold relief, to tes
tify to the w ild that Mr  Woodbury is a man of
umimg industry, of distinguished talents, and of
mcoriuptible integrity, that fidelity hath marked
his footsteps in eveiy situation of life    The high
intellectual and moial qualities of tl is gentleman
have spoken in tores of eloquence, far more lm-
piessive than  anything which I, or any other ,
man, can utter     During the tune he was engaged
m his piofession, as a lawyei in the New Hamp-
sh re courts, he very soon acquited a leputation
which gave him a rank among the first of the ,
many eminent men then at the bar in that Slate
For industry, ability, and fidelity, he was second
to no one     And in consequence of the highiep   I
utation which he had so readily acquired in that I
learned profession, he was honoied with the ap   I
pointment of an associate justice of the highest
tourt of jud cature in  that State, and this, too,
befoie he had reached the age of thirty years
For seveial years he continued to discharge the j
duties of that highly important and responsible
trust with great ability and fidelity, by which he
acquired for himself a reputation which will re- ,
mam among those things which never pensh—a
reputation which his assailants may envy, but can
never equal    Since Mr. Woodbury ¡eft the bench
of the superior court, he has been  principally
engaged m political life     His term of service as
Chief Magistrate of his native State was short,
but soon ifter leaving that elevated situation, he
was elected by the Legislature of that State to a
seat in the north wing of th s Capitol, where for
six years, he sustained a very prominent  rank
among the most distinguished and natnotic states- l
men of tne country     Soon after his term of ser-
vice expned in the Senate of the United States, '
he was appointed Secretary of the Navy, in which I
position, for several years, he not only sustained
the high reputation he had p-eviously acquired,
but increased it with the increase of his sphere of
usefulness
It was in consequence of these developments of
character for extraordmaiy industry, ability, and
sterling integiity, that General Jackson was in-
duced to place Mr Woodbuiy at the head of the
Treasury Department And heie, sir, that gen
tleman has overcome obstacle after obstacle, which
has been thiown in his way by the Opposi'ion,
and has managed the financial affairs of the Gov-
ernment, as I think, with great skill, prudence, and
fidelity, yet those wl o aie opposed to Mi Wood
bury in political opinion may tnirnc otherwise a id
judging from the declamation which we have re
cently heard upon this Door, for a few days past,
we must know that there is an attempt, at least,
to create an impression upon the publ c mind that
Mr Woodbury has not managed the affairs of the
Treasury Department with fidelity, but, on the
contrary, that he has not onlv been grossly neglt
gent in the dischaige of his official duties, but that
he has connived at the frauds which have been
committed by other offieeis of the Government
í rom such charges his previous life, however pure
and spotless, cannot shield him, piovided they
are founded in truth For this I do not contend,
but I do contend that the good name which he had
previously acquired ought to shield him from all
such aspeisions, until they are proved by the most
clear and unequivocal testimony
Now, sir, permit me to ask, whether any such
evidence has been produced' In leply to this in-
quiry, the gentleman fiom Virginia, [Mr Wise,]
as well as the gentleman from Mississippi, [Mi
Prentiss J andothers, wouldieferme o theieport
of the Secretary of the Tieasmy, made to this
House m Marcn last, ' relative to defaulting col
)eaois,"<Si,c ¡arid say, theie is the evidence which
induced them to prefei these charges against that
distinguished officei of the Government These
gentlemen have declared, in the hearing of this
House, and of the country, that that document
contains evidence to prove that Mr Woodbury
has, in diveis instances, neglected not only to
enforce the payment of moneys due the Govern-
ment fiom leceivers and disbursers of the public
revenue, but that he has actually connived at their
frauds and peculations upon the revenue of the
Government And to prove these facts, those
gentlemen have called the attention of the House
to the case oí John Spencer, a receiver of pub' c
moneys at Fott Wayne, in Indiana, William
Linn, of Illinois, W P Harris and G S Boyd,
both of Mississippi, and Mi Reckless, a late
collector of the ¡evenue at Perth Amboy, New |
Jersey, Samuel Swartwout, late collector of the |
customs at New York, and to Gereral Gratiot,
the chief engineer All these cases, except the
last two, are mentioned in the above mentioned
document, and to those cases I will no* ask the
attent on of the House
The first case which is offered in evidence, on
which the Secretary of the Treasury is to be lm
peached, is thatof Mr Spencer      This geml man
is still in office, and the only one among those that
have been named by the gentleman from Virginia
[Mr Wise] as defaulters, who is in the service
of the Government     But this gentleman has been
very much misienresented     Mi   Spencer has not
been a public defaulter     He has always, fairly
and honestly, paid into theTieasury of theUnued
States all moneys which ha/e come into his hands,
and the Government never has, by any default on
the part of Mr  Spencer, lost one dollar     Mr
Woodbury cannot, therefore, have connived at
any fraud Or peculation in this case, because no
fraud has ever been committed     It is true that,
on one or two occasions, the Secretary of the 1
Treasury wrote to Mi  Spem ei requesting him to I
inform that Depaitment why it was that he had I
not depos ted the whole of the money which he
had  received      To   these  inquiries  satisfactory
answers were received     And, if I am correctly
informed, Mr  Spencer always has been, and now
is, esteemed in Ind ana, his native State, as a gen   |
tleman of umnipeaet able ¡ntegilty
The next case to which 1 will ask the attention |
of the House is that of Mr Reckless, the late col
leetor of the customs at Perth Amboy,New Jersey I
This case, lme the former, is peculmr'y unfortu-
nate for the gentlemen who are so ve>-y anxious
to impeach the charactei of the Secietary of the
Treasury Duiing the eight yeais in wnich Mr
Rei kless was collector of the customs, he was in
thiee or four instances requested by ihe Secretary
of the Freasurv to mal e further deposits, unless
the sum letauied in his hands was required to dis
charge debenture certificates To these communi
cations replies were returned by Mr Reckless,
and, sir, had the Secretaty of the Treasury been
net mitted to have furnished this House with thoss
leplies, they woald have satisfied every candid
mind of the entire emptiness of all this vituoeration
against all those who were connected with these
transactions But such was the peculiar phrase-
ology of the resolution upon which this report was
I founded, that the Secretary was denied the oppor-
tunity to give the answers made to his inquiries
by an y of the public officers whose names are men
tioned in that report Mi Reekless, however,
never was a defaulter—never had any intention of
defrauding the Government, neitherdoes the Gov-
ernment pretend to have anyclaim upon thatgen-
I tleman, either in ¡aw or equity, for one cent. So
fai, therefore, the allegations made against the
Secretary of the Treasury are wholly unfounded
I As to the charge made by Mr Reckless for boat
hue, although it was not conformable to ¡aw, yet
I it is very clear that he had no wish or intent to
defraud the Government and, on being informed
by the Department that such charges could not be
allowed, the money was paid into the Treasury
As I before stated, therefore, the Government has
not sufiered a loss of one cent by Mr Reckless
Let us, in the next place, examine the defalca-
tions of the Chief Engmeei, General Gratiot I
admit that this public functionary has committed
a fraud upon the Government, and for which he
has been promptly dismissed from office by tne
Chief Magistrate of the United States The most
piompt and efficient measures have been adopted,
also, to save the Government from «niffeiing any
loss in consequence of the unfaithfulness of that
I officer But foi the purpose of es'ablishmg the
posi'ion which Mr Woodbury's accusers have
assumed, the case of Geneial Gratiot is quite as
unfortunate as those which have already been
mentioned The House will please to recollect
that the above named defaulter belonged to the
War Department, and was wholly accountable to
that Department for any misdemeanors which he
may have committed The Secretary of the Treas-
ury cannot be held responsible for the conduct of
that officer with any moie propriety than he can
for the conduct of every military officer of the
Army of the United States It would be extremely
nlituloui, th iefore, for any one to pietend that
there has been any neglect or connivance on the
part of Mr Woodbury relative to the defa'cation
of General Gratiot
This brings me to the consideration of the re-
cen crs of public moneys in Illinois and Miss s-
sippi No one will pretend to deny that Mr
I inn, Mr Boyd, and Mr Harris are defaulters,
and hat, in consequence, they have long since left
the public service But, foi one, I do deny that
either of those cases furnishes any evidence which
can, n the slightest desree, implicate the charac-
ter or the Secretary of the Treasury These
gentlemen weie recommended to the Executive of
the United States as men of punctuality, honesty,
and fidelity, and upon these testimonials, General
Jackson gave them the appointments wmch they
and then friends solicited and even now, although
these men are m default to the Government there
13 no one who will pretend that either of these
men would, with a c irrupt intent, defraud the
Goveram-nt Dunng the years of 1835 and '36,
thousands broke away from the sober, every-uay
business of life, and went headlong into the most
wild and hazardous speculations These three
individuals were bwept along with this strong and
impetuous ccrrent, until they, as well as thou-
sands of others as heed ess as themselves, were
overwhelmed in debts which they could not dis-
charge
The sin tl at lies at the door of these three
officers of the Government, is, in entering lands
for themselves, for which thev had no means of
making payment    In my opinion, to this may ba
