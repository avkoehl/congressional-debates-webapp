immediately to the Fourth Illinois Cavalry at Collierville ordering them to move with camp and garrison to this place. The Seventh Illinois Cavalry being badly located at La Fayette, I think it would be best to move the regiment to Collierville, or two battalions of it, leaving one at La Fayette, if in your judgment this arrangement would sufficiently guard the railroad.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

DEPARTMENT HEADQUARTERS, Chattanooga, September 14, [13?], 1863-9.55 p. m.

General ROSECRANS,

Lookout Valley:

Dispatch just received from Crittenden, 6.40 p. m. All quiet. Fourth U. S. Cavalry made a reconnaissance down Cove road and within 6 miles of La Fayette. No opposition except small cavalry pickets. Wilder reports rebels falling pack toward Keane's. His advance went within 1 mile of Leet's Tan-yard; found nothing but small cavalry force. I am just sending copies of dispatches by couriers. Several of the staff wish to join you if battle comes off. Have you any objections to communicate by signals?

GODDARD,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

Signal Officer.
