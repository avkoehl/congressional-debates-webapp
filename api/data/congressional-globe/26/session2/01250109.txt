the debt of this District, several of them as early even as the

"From the<*e circumstances, and the considerations that all
which is due from the banks may not be then paid, and that the
balance in the Treasury, under the policy adopted by Congress
sf late years, will of necessity be small, while the fluctuations
and inequalities are very great between the receipts and expen
dituresin different portions of the year, to which we are con
stantly exposed from causes that have on former occasioi s
been explained at length, it must be ohvious that entire safety
requires a conditional power to be seasonably conferred on the
Executive to obtain at any time within 1841 such subsidiary
means as may be needed for a few months, and as may be sufii
cient to enable the 1 reasury punctually to discharge, during
that year, all the liabilities imposed by Congress "
I am aware, sir, that we may be told the esti-
mates are not to be relied upon, that those of the
last year greatly exceeded the revenue of the year,
but still they are mere estirmtes, based upon data
which has hitherto furnished the rule that has go-
verned the course both of the Secretary ard of Con-
gress, and from which I am not disposed to depart,
unless I shall be satisfied that they are founded in
error And fortunate indeed will he be who will
be enabled to make a tolerably near approach to
exactness in these limes of derangement in the mo-
netary affairs of the country, whtn embarrassment
seems to have spread almost over the whole land,
and when revulsion iucceeds revulsion in such ra-
pid succession.
It is known to everj gentleman, that the foreign
commerce of the country constitutes the chief basis
of the revenue of the General Government, and,
with a knowledge of this fact, who can be at a loss
for an explanation of the extraordinary diminution
which has occurred in the revenue from customs
during the last year? Who could have anticipated
a falling off in the imports of more than fifty-seven
millions of dollars?—the imports in 1839 (if I am
right in my recollection) riiing to more than
$160,000,000, ard sinking in 1840 to less than
§105,000 000 We also know that the principal
sources of our present revenue are sensibly affect-
ed by fluctuat ons, not only in commercial prospe-
rity, but in the crops and in the banking policy and
credit systems, both of our own country and of
foreign nations; and the influence of these causes
seems to become yearly more changeable and un-
certain in its extent. Let those gentlemen who
rely upon this ground of objection turn their atten-
tion to the year 1816—a time of profound peace—
when there was a falling off m the regular receipts
from duties from nine mil'ions of dollars, in one
quarter, to only three in the next, and in the sales
of the public lands, trom twenty-four millions of
dollars, in 1836, or an amount over half of all re
ceived in the previous forty years, to Jess than
three millions in 1838 In Michigan, alone the
sale of the public land', m 1836, exceeded five mil-
lions of dollars. They fell in 1838 to #154,384,
and in Mississippi, where, in 1835 and 1836, they
exceeded three millions each year, they fell in 1838
to only $96,636 These extraordinary fluctuations
result, in part, from the vacillating character of
the sources from which our revenue is denved
But most of them are evils inseparable from the
periodical contractions and expansions incident to
the present defective system of banking, in a coun-
try so full of enterprise as ours, with such freedom
in pursuits, such facilities of intercourse, and such
strong temptations to ra«h speculation. I refer to
these facts for the purpose of showing how difficult
it is for any man, with even the best means of in-
formation before him, to arrive at any thing like
exactne«s, under the circumstances in which the
country is placed.
But, sir, I will not anticipate objections If the
estimates are to be íegarded, it appears to me, that
with a sufficiency of accruing revenue during the
year to meet the current expenses of the year, there
will certainly be a deficiency to meet them during
the firet quarter, and possibly for a longer period,
certainly for a longei period, unless timely provi-
sion be made by Congress, and the question arises,
as to what is the best mode of furnishing the relief
required. I know, sir, that much diversity of opi-
nionfexists among the members of this House on
this subject. I know that ithas been soon all previous
occasions, when similar measures have been intro-
duced The friends of the measure, regarding the
deficiency m the Treasury as merely temporary,
propose to anticipate for a short time only, the re-
venue of the Government, which cannot be received
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
in time to mee' its liabilities as they may arise
Gentlemen standing opposed to us, regarding the
deficiency not as tempoiary, but permanent, will in
all probability propose on this occasion, what has
been before pioposed in similar ca^ss—to make per-
manent provision for it by contracting a loan, and
thus, in all probability, lay ihe foundation for a per
manent national debt. I need scarce say to you,
sn, that I am opposed to a permanent national debt,
unless demanded by circumstances of overruling
necessity Whether th= deficiency now to be pro-
vided for, be temporary or permanent, must be
judged of by us from the b st information within
our rtacb, that a deficiency exists has, I think,
been clearly shown by the documents referred to,
and lhat it is temporary merely, we have the autho-
rity of the Secretary of the Treasury, whose report
points us distinctly to the means deemed by him
sufficient to meet all the charges upon the Treasury
during the year, and in this view of the question
we are called upon to determine whether it would
be be*t to issue Tr a>ury notes or negotiate a loan,
the one mode will afford prompt and speedy relief,
tne other may not, one is certain, the other uncer-
tain, the one is within our grasp, the other beyond
our control
But it has been shown, that in whatever form
the rehpf asked for may be furnished, such is th 
condition of the Treasury as to require that it
should be speedily provided, such are thepres^ng
demands upon it at this time, and so large the
amount to be provided by the 4th of March, when
more than $1,000 000 for pensions will be payable,
lhat if there was a certainty of procuring ihe
amount by a loan, the delay to which the officer
charged with the subject would be subjected in
giving notice, advertising, receiving sealed propo-
sals, and negotiating the loan, would, in all probabi-
lity, postpone it to a period too remote to meet the
exigency against which it is mteaded to guatd In
the face of these difficulties, it does appear to me
both wise ard politic, to adopt the measure pro-
posed, which has hiih-rto proved effectual to furnish
m the most convenient form, and in the speediest
possible manner, the contemplated relief
But is it certain that a loan could be negotiated
at all? To my mind it appeals exceedmg'y doubt
ful Now, sir, let it be borne m mind, that frem
the most authent c data, the deficiency to be pro
vided for, is temporary merely, and not permanent
it is expected lo be reimbursed at Ihe close of the
present year, and if this be so, there certainly tan
exist no sufficient reason why we should borrow
for a longer period, since it would impose upon the
Government the obligation of paying interest upon
a debt, which its wants would not require Ihe
question then recurs, could you be likely to nego-
tiate a loan for so short a period? The capi-
talist, I presume, in making his investments
of money, would look first to ihe security of
the investment itself, and, secondly, to the time
for which it is to continue—ard hence that an in-
vestment in Government securities ettend ng
through a series of years, would perhaps be more
desirable than any other, but the fact, that it
would be redeemed within a year, would strip
from it all its attractions, since the capitalist to
whom the Government would look to take tne
loan, would, in all probability, have lo sell out
his stock m the funds, or draw in his money se-
cured by trust deeds and mortgages fori presume
that no judicious capitalist would erer keep a very
large amount of money locked up idle in his desk,
when it cou'd be judiciously invested. And what
prudent man would be willing to change these se-
curities for such a contingency as this? It were
idle to expect it
Again, can jou certainly rely upon procuring
the amount required, by a loan, upon reasonable
terms, at a time when the p ople are m d<,bt,
the State  of this Union in debt, a~d nations are m
debt'
The next resort would be to the banks Should
ed to procure it from that quarter Remember we
may posnbly want $5,000 000, and that in specie,
or i's equivalent, convertible pap-r, if there be
anv such thing. Why, sir, we know that the
banks are now, as they have been for nearly three
years, unable to redeem their own aote¡> in specie.
109
And although the time is at hand.when by the enact-
ments of the Legislatures of States, they are re-
quired to resume specie payments;, the strong pro-
bability i\ that they will either not resume, or if
they uo, tha' it will be followed very quickly by
another suspension. At an) rate it would, in the
present crippled condi ion ef the banks, be a very
unsafe reliance
Bat pass this bill and it opperates directly to re-
lieve the banks It will furnish, in the form of
Treasury notes, to ihe extent of the issue under it,
a substitute for specie. These no es will soon find
their way to our Atlantic cities, and be received at
the cu«tGm-hous«s in payment of duties They
will also find their way to the West, and go into
the land offices in payment for the public lands, and
so far from operating injuriously to the banks,
the efiect will be to sustain and relieve them.
In the remark  which I have now submitted, I
have endeavored to present the subject before the
committee, in a finan ial view alone, apart from
those exciting political topics so oftsn introduced
into the debates in this House.
The means provided by the bill now under con-
sideration are considered amply sufficient to enable
the Government to meet punctually all its liabilities
dunng ihe year, and I have only farther to express
the hope that those into whose hands the admini-
stration of the Government must shortly pass, may
be enabled so to direct the ship ef State as to pre-
serve, in their purity, our Republican institutions,
advance the prosperity of our common country,
and promote ihe happiness of its citizeB*.

ment, but on a question arising as to its being in
order, it was, for the present, withdrawn.
JResohed, That the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union be discharged from the fur-
ther consideration of the bill in relation to Trea-
suiy notes, and that the subject of making provi-
sion for the wants of the Treasury be referred back
to the Committee of the Ways and Means with in-
structions—
1   To bring in a bill authorizing the Secretary
of the Treasury to borrow ten millions of dollars
on the credit of the Government, and to issue bonds
or scrip therefor
2   To bring in a bill imposing additional reve-
nue on wines, silks, linens, sp ce«, and other arti-
c es, being luxuries, imported into the United States,
but in such manner as not to conflict with the
pnnc pies, policy, and spirit of the act oí 2d March,
