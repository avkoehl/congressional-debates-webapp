GENERAL: One of General Sheridan's scouts has just come in. He was below Middleton yesterday. He reports that there are three regiments of cavalry below there, 2 miles south, and that 1,000 cavalry went to join Forrest day before yesterday. He further says that Bragg has 30,000 men,the main body being at Shellbyville, and that all of the infantry, except the pickets, went into the fortifications there on the 23rd instant, and that there brigades left Shelbyville on the 20th instant for Knoxville or Vicksburg. No news.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: We drove the rebels back through Old Fosterville into Guy's Gap this afternoon, from which they opened on us with artillery. The gap is very strong and difficult to turn, except by making a wide detour. From the best information I can get, there are three or four regiments of infantry in Guy's Gap, with one battery. There are other infantry regiments a short distance back toward Shelbyville. General Wharton's division of cavalry is also at and about the gap. [W. T.] Martin's brigade of cavalry left Tuesday morning for Chapel Hill, and probably Wiggins' battery ditto. One regiment of cavalry, supposed to be the Eighth Texas, left in the direction of Manchester this morning. Mitchell whipped them handsomely at Middleton yesterday. Killed some 10 or 15 men and 50 horses, besides the wounded. How are Thomas and McCook progressing?

Respectfully,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.
