Gladden. - Repairs are progressing as well as circumstances will permit.

McIntosh. - Earth is still being carried to Battery McIntosh, and the rear gallery for the bomb-proof will be commenced the ensuing week. Workmen are now engaged in raising the two left flank guns.

Camel Battery. - The magazine has been placed in good condition, and workmen are now engaged in sodding on the top.

THIRD DIVISION.

Huger. - Labor has principally been expended on south face covered way. Strengthening parapet and sodding superior and exterior slopes.

Obstructions. - Owing to derangement of pile-driver no piles were driven until 17th instant. Operations resumed.

A torpedo force has been engaged in opening a gap in obstructions in Apalachee River, under the direction of the engineer officer in charge of this division.

FOURTH DIVISION.

The manufacture of torpedoes and collection of material has been continued. The working force has been so much reduced that but little progress can be made. The distribution on the city entrenchments yesterday was as follows:

Hands.

Redoubt H ............................................ 5

Redoubt F ............................................ 13

Curtain from I to K .................................. 47

Sod cutting .......................................... 14

Redoubt N ............................................ 122

Wood chopping ........................................ 14

Redoubt C ............................................ 9

Total ................................................ 224

One hundred and fifty hands are engaged on Batteries McIntosh and Tilghman, 90 are at work at Battery Huger, 50 on the pile-drivers with Mr. King, so that the working force proper does not exceed 514 hands in the whole district. Our transportation has also been much reduced, there being only eight good teams and one steam-boat suitable for heavy towing at the disposal of the engineers.

The gap in the obstructions near Battery Huger would have been opened sooner had it been possible to procure another boat besides the Magnolia, which is doing at the same time all the work on the bay batteries.

Respectfully submitted.

S. SHELIHA,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief Engineer, District of the Gulf.
