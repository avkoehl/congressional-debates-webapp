Brigade commanders will see that as much slashing is done as possible in front of their works before night as nothing can be accomplished after dark. While the slashing parties are at work the men will be under arms pits. A large number of men are in the rear, getting water, &c. All the men must be kept with their respective regiments ready for any emergency.

By command of Brigadier-General Willcox:
