general court-martial here, but I suppose his place could be easily filled on the court. Major McCall has made a good officer,but he is attached to the arsenal and I could only assign him temporarily, as I did, simply as executive officer.

I am, colonel, &amp;v.,

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.
HDQRS. DIST. OF SOUTHWESTERN VA. AND EAST Tennessee, Camp near Bean's Station, Tennessee, December 19, 1863.

Hon. J. A. SEDDON,Secretary of War:

SIR: Having witnessed a good deal of the operations of what are known as partisan rangers, I have the honor to petition that all such organizations be abolished. They are usually, so far as my experience has gone, the most trifling troops we have. Acting alone, they accomplish nothing, and when serving with other troops they hang upon the rear to gather up property, and instead of turning it into the proper departments, spirit it away for speculation. Besides, it is evident injustice to the great mass of the army for a small part to be allowed pay for partial captures, while those who do the real work have no special reward. It will create great satisfaction to have all the troops put on the same footing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. RANSOM, Jr.,

Major-General.

MOBILE, ALA., December 20, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

General Shoup has never been assigned brigade commander of artillery at Mobile.

General Moore has never been applied for by me for artillery duty. I write by mail.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

DECEMBER 23, 1863.

Order Brigadier-General Moore to rejoin his former brigade in Lieutenant-General Hardee's command, and retain Brigadier-General Shoup for artillery.

S. COOPER.
