Our true policy should be to develop the
country and at the same time secure the
lands beyond a peradventure for the settler.
The country has long since settled down upon
the conviction that Congress ought not farther
to grant the public domain to objects which
wilt place the lands where the settler cannot
obtain them, or if obtained at all only at a high
price per acre.
The chairman of the Pacific Railroad Com-
mittee, [Mr. Wbkgl.er,] who has this bill in
charge, and who has just addressed the House,
stated in his remarks that he did not know the
amount of acres granted to this railroad com-
pany. That the House may know something
of the magnitude of the subject with which we
are dealing, I will state that the lands granted
will exceed fifty million acres, being fifteen
million acres more than are embraced in the
whole State of Illinois. Sir, you search the
annals of ancient and modern history in vain
to find a parallel for so munificent a gift as
this. No prince or potentate, State or sover-
eignty, ever gave so rich a dowry.
At $2 50 per acre this grant would yield the
enormous sum of $125,000,000. Sir, if we
shall now let pass the opportunity to secure
these lands to actual settlers we will place our-
selves but little above "the base Indian who
threw a pearl away richer by far than all his
tribe." We will fail to meet the expectations
of the people, and will excite in their minds
just alarm in regard not only to this grant but
in relation to others npon which we may be
called to pass, unless we now insist upon the
imposition upon this grant of the terms I pro-
pose. From this rule Congress should never
depart. If always adhered to the country would
not view with alarm as it now does the grant-
ing of the public lands to aid in the construc-
tion of railroads through the new and .unsettled
portions of the country.
A grant judiciously made may result in great
to all. It will build roads through the
wild and unsettled regions of the West, and
furnish cheap lands to the pioneer, with the
Means of transporting his crops to market. I
know full well that the great body of the coun-
ty lying between the Missouri river and the
racific ocean, and also between Lake Superior
•vnd the Pacific, can never be settled without
construction of railroads. There are in
vast region but few navigable streams.

that
and without railroads settlers will have no
weans ot transportation. I realize fully the
great importance to be attached to the early
construction of one or more roads to the Pa-
cific ocean, not only as a means of settling the
country, but as a great highway upon which
e commerce of this and other lands may
pass. '
41st Cong. 2d Sess.—No. 205.
Nothing can more surely advance the pros-
perity and growth of the whole country than
internal improvements. Let the water com-
munications be perfected where practicable
and railroads be constructed whenever capital
can be induced to invest in new enterprises.
Give full scope and employment to all the
labor and skill of the whole country. Make
the regions now given up to the Indian and the
wild beast to resound with the busy hum of
industry, and fill them with happy homes and
firesides. Let the farmer go with his plow,
the miner with his pick and shovel, and the
artisan with the implements of his skill.
The completion of the Pacific railroad last
year marked one of the graudest epochs in the
history of our times. As a great triumph of
skill, energy, and perseverance, itstands unpar-
alleled in the history of railroad construction.
The driving of the last golden spike on that
fair May day of last year completed the last link
in the iron chain that bound the two oceans
together. It completed the grand highway upon
which with the speed of the winds the mes-
senger of anew civilization, with dazzling brow,
breath of steam, and lungs of fire, dragging the
wealth of nations at his heels, should pass from
ocean to ocean. It completed, too, another
link in that golden chain of Union, the forging
of whose links has cost this nation so much
of blood and treasure.
As I have said upon a former occasion, noth-
ing can so strongly tend to make the people of
this vast country one in interest and in feel-
ing as the furnishing of convenient and cheap
iacilities for commerce and intercourse. The
enterprise and energy of our people are shown
in the fact that in this country there are now
about fifty thousand miles of railroad com-
pleted and in operation. The finished rail-
roads of the world, as shown by Poor's Man-
ual, embraced at the close of 1868 an aggregate
of one hundred and nine thousand one hundred
and seventy-seven miles. Thu3 it will be seen
that already this country has almost half of the
entire railroads of the world.
One of the strongest arguments in favor of
railroads and railroad grants in the unsettled
portions of the country is the fact that they
furnish when built the surest and best means
of transportation for troops and supplies in all
our military operations against the Indians.
It not only enables ns to transport troops and
supplies lor a price greatly below what we
would otherwise pay, but it enables ns to con-
trol the Indians with a much less nnmber of
troops than would otherwise be necessary,
because with the railroads we can move them
rapidly from one place to another as they are
needed.
To show the economy of rail over wagon
transportation for the purpose of transporting
troops and supplies, I call attention to the fol-
lowing table of freights over the one hundred
and fifty-three miles of the Kansas Pacitic rail-
road in 1867, as reported by the Military Com-
mittee of this House:

General Grant, in discussing this subject in
his report as Secretary of War, said:
"During the last summer, and before I caused
inspections to bemadfioi thevarious routes of travel
and supply through the territory between the Mis-
souri river and the Pacific coast, the cost of main-
taining troops in that section w%s so enormous that
I desired if possible to reduce it. This I have been
enabled to do to some extent from the information
obtained from theso inspoctions; but for the present
the military establishment between the lines desig-
nated must be maintained at a great cost per man.
Tho completion of the railroads to the Pacific will
materially reduce this cost, as well as the number
of men to be kept there. The completion of theso
roads will also go far toward a permanent settlement
of our Indian difficulties."
But I do not deem it necessary to pursue this
branch of the subject further. All will admit
that the construction of railroads through the
western territory would be desirable if they
could be built by private capital. For my own
part I believe there are cases when a wise
statesmanship will aid them by limited grants
of land, and upon the terms and conditions
I have indicated. I would not, however, in
any case, permit the lands to be sold to other
than actual settlers or for a price greater than
$2 50 per acre. By such a course cheap lands
will be furnished the settler, both as to lands
granted for the benefit of the railroad company
and as to the alternate sections retained by the
Government, and which may be sold at $2 50
per acre or settled under the homestead and
preemption laws.
For a brief period we of the present Con-
gress hold in our hands the title deeds to a
broader empire than that over which Csesar
swayed the scepter of his power, and the people
will hold us to a strict accountability for the
manner in which we manage or dispose of this
vast estate. The march of events is carrying
ns forward in the raee of progress and glory
with unparalleled rapidity. In all the elements
of progress and power which -characterize a
great and free people we occupy a position
among the foremost nations of the earth. And
yet we stand but in the morning of our coun-
try's day. Her present compared with her
future is like the few faint streaks that mark
the east, betokening the coming of the day-
god, compared with the glory of his shining
when he shall have reached the full meridian
of his power.
Mr. WHEELER. I now yield to the gen*
tleman from Minnesota, [Mr. Wilson,] my col-
league on the committee.
Mr. WILSON, of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker,
my State has a greater interest in this measure
than any other of the Union. The road com-
mences on Lake Superior, in my district, and
runs two hundred and fifty miles through it.
While one half-of the territory of Minnesota
lies above the forty-sixth parallel nearly all of
its population is below it. The upper portion
of that State has not been settled, although its
lands are good, because it has no communica-
tions to market. We know this road passing
through it will produce for it the same marvel-
ous development which the southern half of
our State has exhibited under the land-grant
system.
This grant was made some six years ago,
and complaint is made that nothing has been
done. This only shows the grant is not too
large for the purpose for which it was given.
Although some of the best men in the coun-
