HDQRS. DIST. OF TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, AND ARIZONA,Houston, Tex., December 21, 1862.

Col. S. S. ANDERSON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to inclose a list* of officers of the Federal Army who are represented by the New Orleans papers to have arrived in that place. The papers state that General Corcoran has sailed from New York for that place. You will perceive from the inclosed list of officers that there are two major-generals, and as these organizations are in all probability complete, this expedition must consist of at least 20,000 men. To meet this invading force you will see from my letter to Lieutenant-General Holmes, forwarded several days since (a copy of which is herein inclosed),+ that I am by no means prepared, on account of the disorder and want of organization which prevails here on account of the removal of troops from this district.

In view of these facts I have the honor to urgently renew my request that the troops ordered by Lieutenant-General Holmes to report to Brigadier-General Scurry be retained under his command in this district. Should General Holmes, in view of this information, deem it proper to grant my request, any orders from him countermanding or changing the movements of these forces will reach their commanding officers if forwarded to them en route by Shreveport to Monroe, La. It is scarcely necessary for me to say that great dissatisfaction exists in this State at the removal of armed troops from its limits and the retention of those only who are unarmed. Please send copies of such orders countermanding to these headquarters.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. BANKHEAD. MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DIST. OF TEXAS, NEW MEXICO, AND ARIZONA,Houston, Tex., December 21, 1862.

His Excellency Hon. F. R. LUBBOCK,

Governor of State of Texas:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that Lieutenant-General Holmes has ordered Sibley's brigade, together with Gurley's and Stone's regiments, to Louisiana, and that I have obeyed the order. I am in receipt
