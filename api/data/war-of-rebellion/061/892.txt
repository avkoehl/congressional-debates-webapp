APRIL 18, 1864. - Affair at Hunnewell, Mo.

Report of John T. K. Hayward.

BROOKFIELD, April 18, 1864.

Three bushwhackers came into Hunnewell to-day, armed to the teeth, and came to plunder. Citizens resisted. One citizen is dead and 1 mortally wounded, and Captain Farnam badly wounded. They killed 1 bushwhacker and captured 1 and 1 escaped. I have telegraphed to our agent there that it is contrary to orders to capture such men and to shoot him before he escapes. I fear they will yet do it. What are your orders? I don't think it is to keep him there.
