TEN MILES EAST OF FLORENCE,

October 19, 1864 - 9 a. m. (Via Pulaski.)

Major-General THOMAS:

Forrest forded the river in his late raid at Colbert Shoals, one mile above Waterloo. A gun-boat at Waterloo would cover that and shorten my line fifteen miles, as there is neither ford nor ferry within that distance above.

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.

NASHVILLE, October 19, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Brigadier General John T. CROXTON,

Ten miles east of Florence, via Pulaski:

General Granger will have the Tennessee patrolled by the Second Regiment Tennessee Cavalry until the Ninth and Tenth Regiments Indiana Cavalry can be furnished with horses. If I can get a gun- boat to watch the ford at Colbert Shoals I will do so, but would advise you not to rely on such assistance.
