WASHINGTON, D. C., November 3, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge your letter of October 13, calling for a report upon the provisions made for procuring an adequate supply of clothing and shelter for the troops in the field and for the levies coming into service.

At the time of the call for 300,000 volunteers and 300,000 drafted militia in July and August last a large quantity of clothing was on hand. Of the principal articles of clothing there was a stock estimated to be sufficient to supply the troops then in service for from six to nine months.

I had the honor to the 13th of August, 1862, to report to you upon the steps taken to prepare for the increase of the Army. A copy of that report (A) is herewith inclosed.* I also inclose a copy of a letter of instructions (B), embracing the draft of an advertisement sent to the officers in charge of the three principal depots for procuring clothing, camp and garrison equipage.+ These depots are located in New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati. The quantities of goods required were so large that to invite at once bids for the whole might have resulted in too great excitement in the market, and in putting the supply almost entirely in the hands of a few large capitalists or dealers. The invitations for bids, therefore, announced that after ten days the bids received to that time would be opened and contracts awarded, and that from time to time as the public service required additional contracts would be given to the lowest bidders who might appear and give security for the fulfillment of their engagements. The advertisement is published as a standing invitation to manufacturers.

The officers in charge of these deports were directed to fill all requisitions made upon them by proper authority, to accumulate as soon as possible a stock in each of the ticient for the instant equipment of 100,000 men, and to keep on hand a stock sufficient to supply the demand arising from the ordinary wear and tear in seipment of 200,000 men.

As a large quantity of cloth and other materials for the manufacture of uniform coats and trousers had accumulated in the depots, and as it was of importance to make it up quickly, enough of this material was distributed to supply the 300,000 drafted militia, with instructions to make up the garments as far as possible within the States themselves. See instructions (C) and notification (D).+
