Adjutant-General of the United States that on examination no charges had or could be preferred against Turner, and recommended his final discharge. May I now ask of you the official and personal kindness to forward that discharge to,

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War.

In view of the within recent report of General Terry that evidence cannot, upon investigation, be found sufficient to warrant bringing this man to trial by a military court, no motive is perceived to remain for continuing in his case even the inconsiderable restraint of a parole.

Judge-Advocate-General.

Respectfully referred to the Adjutant-General with directions to carry into effect the suggestions of the Judge-Advocate-General by giving a release from the parole.
