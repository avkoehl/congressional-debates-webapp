(Received 7.10 p. m.)

Major RAYMOND, Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: All quiet along the river. Learn nothing new to-day. Shall send small party across to-night in boat to gain information. Have heard no firing to-day in the Shenandoah; suppose the reason to be that General Sheridan has driven the enemy out of hearing distance.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. WAITE,

Major, &amp;c.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,Near Fort Buffalo, Va., September 20, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR, Chief of Staff and Asst. Adjt. General:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that 8 officers and 140 men of the party commanded by Colonel Lazelle returned this evening. Some others, numbers not know, have also returned at Annandale. They report that yesterday (Monday) morning Colonel Lazelle burnt the bridge across the Rapidan, on the Orange and Alexandra Railroad, the six-stone mill, said to contain 500 barrels flour, and captured 150 mules and horses. After this the colonel moved up the railroad toward Culpeper Court-House, where a large force of rebel infantry, cavalry, and artillery were encountered, estimated variously at from 500 to 1,000 or more men and four pieces of artillery. A skirmish ensued while Colonel Lazelle's party were moving to the right of Culpeper, which resulted in the confusion and separation of our force, some retreating by the direct road to Kelly's Ford, on the Rappahannock, and treating by the direct road the Kelly's Ford, on the Rappahannock, and others being driven back to the right of the railroad. It is to be hoped that we shall hear from them by to-morrow at least.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. S. GANSEVOORT,

Colonel Thirteenth New York Cavalry, Commanding.
