Ccn titution, and the people who approved it with
calm and sagacious delibeiation, acted at the time
on a sounder principle They wisely judged that
the less Government inter)eres with pmate pur-
suits, the better for the general prosperity It is
not its legitimate object to make men rich, or to
repair, by direct giants of money or legislation m
favor oi particular pursuits losses not mcuired m
the public sftvice This would be substantially to
use the propeiI) of some for the benefit of others
But its ital duty—that duty, the performance of

casioned by the wajwardness of man, we have
been blessed throughout our extended terntoiy with
a season ot general health and of uncommon fruit-
iulness Ihe proceeds of our great staples will
soon furnish the means of liquidating debts at
home and abroad, and contribute equally to tbe
revival of commercial activity, and the restotation
of commercial credit The banks, established
avowedly for its support, deriving thtir profits
from it, and resting under obi gallons to it which
cannot be overlooked, w ill leel at once the neces-
sity and jusbce of uniting their energies with those
of the mercantile interest The suspension of
specie pa) men's, at such a time and under such
circumstances as we have lately witnessed, coull
not be other than a temporary measure, and we
can scarcelj eir in believing that the penod must
soon arrive when all that aie solvent will redeem
their issues in go'd and silver Dealings abtoad
