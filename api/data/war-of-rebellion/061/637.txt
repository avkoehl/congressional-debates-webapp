a matter of surprise that with my handful of men I was unable to prevent the construction of the dams at the falls of Red River by the enemy, since the large forces on the other side likewise failed to prevent that construction with equal if not greater opportunities.

The troops under my command behaved, with few exceptions, better than I expected under the impressions received from Colonel Harrison's representations. I may be allowed, however, to select for special commendation and respectfully to recommend to the attention of the general commanding Lieutenant Colonel F. W. Moore and Capts. R. Sewell and H. P. Wells, of Harrison's regiment; Major Waddill, of McNeill's regiment, and Captain W. H. Corbin, of Capers' regiment, all of whom were conspicuous for gallantry. Lieutenant-Colonel Moore is competent to fill a much higher position than he now occupies. I am grateful to my staff for their faithful and efficient discharge of their respective duties.

I am, colonel, respectfully, your obedient servant,

ST. JOHN R. LIDDELL,

Brigadier General, Provisional Army Confederate States.
