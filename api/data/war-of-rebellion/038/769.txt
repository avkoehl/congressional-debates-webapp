Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Colonel Roddey reports by telegraph from Tuscumbia, on 20th instant, a large number of Federal steamers at Eastport, bringing 25,000 troops, by whom the town was burned. Also that a citizen from Paducah, Ky., says that steamboats on the Ohio River have been pressed to transport forces from the Mississippi River to Northern Alabama.

TULLAHOMA, April 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

A scout of General Van Dorn reports from Centerville, Tenn., that he saw on the 17th, going up the Tennessee River, seventeen transports and one gunboat, and the next day he heard that seven more went up, the whole with 112,000 men at least, much of it cavalry. Also that a part of Grant's army had gone up Mobile and Central Railroads and part to Louisville.

By command of General Johnston:

BENJ. S. EWELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

TULLAHOMA, April 20, 1863.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

It is necessary that your northeastern troops and Roddey's force should always act together against raids from Corinth, either to south or east. Please instruct your commanding officer. Let him help Roddey now, or as soon as possible. This co-operation will prevent or defeat serious raids.

J. E. Johnston.

JACKSON, April 20, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston:

I have not sufficient force to give any efficient assistance to Colonel Roddey. [Enemy] are advancing from Memphis, via Hernando; from Grand Junction and LA Grange, via Holly Springs and Salem; from Corinth, via New Albany. You are aware I have but feeble cavalry force, but I shall certainly give you all the assistance I can. I have virtually no cavalry from Grand Gulf to Yazoo city, while the enemy is threatening to cross river between Vicksburg and Grand Gulf, having twelve vessels below Vicksburg. On yesterday Chalmers met enemy at Coldwater and repulsed him. On 18th, one gunboat and one transport passed Austin, towing FIFTEEN that-boats, or pontoon bridges; twenty-five skiffs on them. On 19th, a transport towing sixteen flats, or pontoons.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 20, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma:

Can you not make a heavy demonstration with cavalry toward Abbeville, on Tallahatchee River, if only for 50 miles? The enemy is endeavoring to force a diversion of my troops to Northern Mississippi.
