Mr CHAMBERS said he recollected the case
alluded to by the gentleman from Alabama, and if
his object was to recommit this report, he thought
if the gentleman examined it more closely, he
would find himself mistaken in the extent to which
he supposed the precedent went, as a justification
of a minority report [Mr C here read an extract
from the Senate Journal ] Here there was no
recommitment In the piogress of the proceed
mg, the minority presented a paper expressive of
their views, which was íeceued, and he was will-
ing to extend the same indulgence to the gentle-
man from New York
Mr CALHOUN said he was in the Chair on
the occasion alluded to, and had a distant íecol
lection of it It was submitted as a paper, and
printed as a paper, not as a report
Mr KING replied that tne minority made a
report, and it purported to be the report of a
minority of the committee, call it by what name
you please, and it was also ordered to be printed
What distinction was there in calling it a paper,
when it was a íeport, and was called a report'
Now, he was anxious to know the grounds, not
only on which the majority, but also the minority,
founded their opinions, and when a subject of so
much importance was presented, as one involving
the light of an individual '0 a seat in the Senate
of the United States, it was highly desirable to
have the whole subject befoie us, so that Senators
might be enabled to examine it thoroughly He
would withdraw his motion to recoir mit the report,
ava he hoped the gentleman from New York, on
the part of the minority, would present his views
on the subject .
Mi WRIGHT said it was immaterial to him
what disposition was made of the question His
object was to discharge his duty as a member of
the comm ttee to the best of his ability, and if it
was not a part of his du y to draw up a counter
íeport, he had no desne to uo it, but if it was, he
would carefully undeitake it But from the gen
eial expression of the gent'eman from Alabama
and others on the subject, he would endeavor to do
his duty aseailyas he could get possession of the
papers, and prepare the report
Mr GRUNDY moved that the correspondence
between the Committee on the Post Office and Post
Roads and the Postmaster General be printed,
which was agieed to
Mr GRUNDY submitted the following resolu-
tion, which was considered and adopted
Resolved, That ti e Postmaster General be di

vices rendeied ard expenses incurred prior to that 1
date, and also whether any balance remains due I
fiom that d parfnent, and if any, what amounts
