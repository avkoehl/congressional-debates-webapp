Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Commanding Confederate Forces, Dept. of S. C., Ga., and Fla.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 10th instant, in reply to mine of the 5th, in regard to James Pike and Charles R. Gray, now confined in the jail tower at Charleston. You state therein that they were arrested in Edgefield District, S. C.; that they were not in U.

It is like easy of access to both of us, and is sheltered from all but the most violent storms.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,
