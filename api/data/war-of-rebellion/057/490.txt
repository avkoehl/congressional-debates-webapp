We passed out, throwing our force on the left, which resulted in killing 3 of the enemy and wounding 6 or 7. Our casualties were 5 missing. I learn from citizens that 4 of them were prisoners, and the enemy claimed that they killed 1. The enemy at once retired. A prisoner taken says their force was 2,000 consisting o two brigades under General Wheeler, and that it was an attempt on Wheeler's part to capture us. Wheeler was much enraged, charging that treachery on the part of some of his men saved us.

The position we occupied is untenable. We have patrolled the country in that neighborhood each day, but one-half of our force should be in front of General Baird, patrolling south. I reported to General Davis, and received orders to remain here. One of my companies fell back toward General Baird, one was there before; so that General Baird has but two companies. If the Thirty-ninth was all at ringgold and the Kentucky battalion here it would divide the force about equally.

I am, general, very respectfully,

T. J. HARRISON,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.
