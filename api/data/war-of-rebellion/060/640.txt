(Received 9. 20 p. m., 5th.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I consider myself able to take the field when ordered. It is proper for me to state that my wound is not yet healed, but I am willing to take any risk. I also should add that I have an engagement to speak at Tammany Hall on Monday night at war meeting in connection with recruiting matters, the importance of which is considered great by those in charge of it. You, knowing these facts, will be best able to determine my movements. If I have not answered the dispatch to the point it is because of its generality.

W. S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, March 4, 1864-12 noon.

Brigadier-General KILPATRICK:

Your telegram to General Pleasonton received. You will proceed with your command to Yorktown and draw your supplies from Fort Monroe, awaiting at Yorktown further orders. You will ascertain and report what facilities there are at Fort Monroe for ferrying your command across York River and subsequently at Urbanna. You will also report the total number of men, animals, guns, caissons, and other vehicles with your command.

GEO. G. MEADE,
