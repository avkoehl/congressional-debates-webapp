JOHN L. HODSDON,

Adjutant-General of Maine.

CONCORD, September 16, 1863.

His Excellency the Governor and the

Honorable Council of the State of New Hampshire:

In compliance with your request that I would examine and collate the correspondence and documents submitted to me having reference to the conscription in this State, and present the result of my labors, accompanied with such comments and suggestions as might be deemed pertinent and proper, I have the honor to submit the following:

The subject of the correspondence which follows is a matter which naturally and properly has excited and continues to excite the feelings of the people of New Hampshire in a much greater degree than any other matter or thing which has ever occurred in this State.

When the war broke out no people responded to the call of an imperiled Government more promptly than the people of this State; none made greater sacrifices of their property, their comforts, their affections, and their blood than the people of New Hampshire; none have endured hardships more courageously, or fought more bravely, or died more unflinchingly. And as they have borne and suffered these things, so they would still do all and more than all their duty toward the country, looking in return for a grateful recognition of their services and a measure of justice and fair dealing at the hands of the National Administration.
