Mr. HARLAN. It will be observed that
the Department do not desire the whole of
that amount this coming year. The amount
that is supposed to be necessary for the coming
fiscal year is about three hundred thousand
dollars; but it will require ultimately the sum
of seven or eight hundred thousand dollars to
complete these surveys.
Mr, COLE. I am certainly opposed to this
proposed amendment. The bill contains a pro-
vision authorizing an appropriation of $30,000,
as prepared by the Committee on Appropria-
tions, for surveying Indiau le&ervations. As
passed by the House, $55,000 was proposed to
be appropriated for thai service. The amount
asked for is very large, and, in my judgment,
much more than can be propeily used lor any
such service. Why, sir, it is time we gave
attention to the wishes of the white people, of
the industrial classes of the country. Ihese
suiveys will result in no general good. They
will not, in my judgment, increase the produc-
tiveness upon the reservations. They will not
add to the wealth of those localities, nor to
the general wealth of the nation. There has
been a great deal of demand upon the land
department of the Government to survey the
public lands for homestead and preemption
settlers, and Congress has been exceedingly
reserved heretofore in that kind of appropria-
tion. i do not think that the total amount of
appvopiiations tor the survey of land for the
white people for a year would exceed that
which is asked ior the survey of these Indian
reservations,
I have not the law immediately before me,
bur, looking at it some little time ago—I think
while this bill was undei consideiatiou in the
committee—I found that a few years ago an
appropriation of about, four hundred thousand
dollars was made for the survey of Indian res-
ervations. What became of that money? Was
it expended, and if so. how, and where, and
when, and by whom? The very facf that no
good result seems to have followed that very
large appropriation is a sufficient reason, in
my judgment, why the Senate should reject
the proposed amendment. These Indian res-
ervations lire always selected, it will be remem-
bered, as far away from civilization as possi-
ble. They are generally chosen in some remote
valleys or localities where there will be but
little interruption with the settlements made
by the whites, and they are generally marked
out by natural boundaries ; they are generally
designated by rivers or mountains, by lakes or
by hills, and other natural boundaries, so that
there ib no particular danger of encroachment
upon them by the white settlers, and I assert
that there can be no necessity for the survey
at all of a large share of the reservations now
held by the ludians or set apart for them.
That, there may be some reason for survey-
ing for the purpose of opening to settlement
a portion of the Indian territory is probable ;
but I do not understand that this is asked for
that purpose. It seems to be, according to
the report th^t was read, asking for an appro-
priation to survey different Indian reservations
in ihe Territories at remote poiuts. What good
is to result, from it? Suppose these reserva-
tions are surveyed and marked by stakes and
stones, how long will those marks be found
upon the ground? They will soon become
obliterated, and a new survey will be rendeied
indispensable, if this one is needed at all.
The veiy fact that these reservations are so
remotely situated and marked out by natural
boundaries and objects is, to my mind, a suf
ficient reason for rejecting the proposed
amendment. Why, sir, it is enormous—
$300,000 for surveying Indian reservations
away off in the Territories!
A good deal of complaint is made of the
practice of surveyors in the States and Terri-
tories thatare doing the surveying for the white
people of farms and preemption and home-
stead claims. It is alleged that the surveys
are made in useless places and the money used
up m that way, instead ot being used lor the
real benefit oI settlers, if such allegations be
made with any foundation in reference to that
class of surveys, what may you cxpect ot sur-
veyors that are engaged to survey these Indian
reservations away out beyond the reach of
civilization? Why, sir, it may afford excellent
jobs for a few surveyors. Tney no doubt will
report surveys where none have been made.
Under former administrations, in my own
State surveys are laid down upon the maps of
vast regions that never will be settled. The
large appropriations made fifteen or twenty
years ago for surveys there were expended on
portions of the State that arc now desert, and
money was drawn by the surveyors, no doubt,
when no work was done in many instances. I
would expcct similar practices in this case,
and there is no way for the Commissioner of
Indian Affairs or the Committee on Indian
Affairs or the Secretary of the interior or the
President to prevent it. If this work is under-
taken the Government will be cheated in ref-
erence to this appropriation—necessarily so.
It cannot be given out to persons who will
expend it fairly, because they will see when
they go upon theground ihatthere is no neces-
sity for these surveys, which in my judgment
is clearly the fact. I hope the amendment will
be rejected.
Mr. HARLAN. The honorable Senator is
correct m saying that several hundred thou-
sand dollars have heretofore been appropriated.
Mr. COLft. Four hunaied thousand dol-
lars at one lane.
Mr. JIAULaVN. Two years ag- , I think, that
was. There was but little, J think, approprl
atcd last yeai. He calls on me to slate in
what mode this money has been expended. I
am sure I am unable to do this. If I had sup-
posed there was any question of the appropri-
