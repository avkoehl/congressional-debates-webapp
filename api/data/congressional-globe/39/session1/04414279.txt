to the former plan, so that it became much more
expensive. And these gentlemen, in conse-
quence of the failure in 18G1 of the appropri-
ation to continue the work on this building,
were subjected to a very great expense after-
ward in reopening the quarries that had become
filled up and replacing machinery that had be-
come injured or destroyed.
Mr. "V^ILSON, of Iowa. What is the amount
of the claim ?
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I cannot tell; but the
whole matter is referred to the Secretary of the
Interior. I ask the Clerk to read a letter from
Mr. Walter, the architect of the building.
The Clerk read as follows:
Washington, D. C., April IB, 1866.
Sib: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt
of your letter of the 9th instant, in which you desire
me to communicate to you the circumstances under
which Messrs. Berry & Higgins recommenced work
in 1864 on the north wing of the Patent Office build-
ing; and what was said as to the prices they, should
be paid for the marble and granite; also whether I
understood the work upon the portico of this wing
to be included in the original contract, and whether
the contract price was, in my judgment, a fair com-
pensation, taking into consideration the high price
of labor, &c.
In reply to these interrogatories, I have to state
that the original contract for the marble and the mar -
ble-workof thenorthwingof the Patent Officebuild-
ing was made with Mr. John "P. Connelly on the 1st
day of April, 1857, and that it was not contemplated
at that time to erect any portico at all on the north
front. This is manifest by the omission of any allu-
sion in the contract to such an appendage, as well as
by the fact that Congress did not authorize it until
long after the contract in question wasmade. These
facts settle the question mostdeeidedlythatthenorth
portico was not included in the original agreement.
On the 16th day ol December, 1861, Mr Connelly
transferred his contract, by legal and proper docu-
ments, and with the official sanction of the Govern-
ment, by the Secretary of the Interior, to Messrs.
Berry & Higgins. Copies of this transfer with all the
documents, including the original contract, are on
file in the Department.
No progress having been made on the aforesaid
north portico at the breaking out of the rebellion,
the work was suspended until the 26th day of August,
1864, when, in pursuance of ordersfrom the Secretary
of the Interior, I directed the aforesaid contractors,
Messrs. Berry & Higgins, to proceed with the work.
On the receipt of this order they called upon me and
stated, very emphatically, that they could not exe-
cute the north portico at the prices paid to Provest,
Winter & Co. for the east and west porticoes, the de-
tails of which, it was understood, were to govern the
architecture of that on the north. The reasons they
gave for the conclusions they had thus arrived at
were, that the quarries were abandoned and filled
with mud and water; the railways, hoisting appa-
ratus, and machinery were destroyed; that every-
thing would have to be commenced anew, and that
a fearful rise had taken place in the prices of labor,
machinery, and transportation. I told them that
inasmuch as the north portieoformcd no part of their
agreement, they would not be held to the prices paid
in former times on the eastern and western porticoes,
and I urged upon them the necessity of reopening the
quarries without delay, and of proceeding vigorously
with the work, at the same time stating to them that
the facts of the case would warrant me, as the super-
intendent of the building, in awarding them a fair
and equitable compensation for their labor. In all
these suggestions I nad the sanction of the Secretary
of the Interior, and we felt not only assured that this
was the best arrangement we could make under the
circumstances, butwe considered ourselves fortunate
in inducingcontractorsof so much ability and energy
as Messrs. Berry & Higgins to undertake to reopen
these quarries, put up the necessary machinery, and
deliver the stone at such prices as wo might subse-
quently decide, on the part of the Government, were
rightand proper. And I nowhavc to say that, in view
of all the knowledge that the subsequent progress of
the work has developed, I am of the opinion that the
cost of the material for the north portico is fully
double of that which was delivered for the east and
west porticoes, and wereitleft to meto decide I would
award them one hundred per cent, advance on the
prices of the aforesaid porticoes, the erection of which
took place many years ago, and at a time when the
quarries were in full operation, and quarry labor and
expenses wore one hundred per cent, less than they
now are.
As it regards the workmanship of the aforesaid
north portico, I am of the opinion that the same
schedule of prices should prevail as governed the
payments on the east and west porticoes, with the
addition of sixty per cent, to all'the items, that being
the average increase in the prices of the labor of
marble-masons since the aforesaid eastern and west-
ern porticoes were crected. This would have been
my award had the power of fixing these prices re-
mained with me.
In most cases, where a contract is entered into for
a certain work, the contractor takes the risk of a rise
or a fall of prices, but in the present instance there
is no contract to which the contractors may be held,
so far, at least, as it regards the portico in question.
It therefore devolves upon the Government to meto
out justice, which can best bo done by addin? to pi ices
formerly paid for similar work and materials what-
ever advance a general cho,ngeof values may have
made apparent.
These remarks and conclusions apply as well to
the granite and the granite-work of the aforesaid
north portico as they do to the marble, excepting
only that the cost of procuring the granite was not
enhanced beyond the ordinary rise in the cost of
quarrying and transportation. I am therefore of
the opinion that an addition of sixty per cent, to
the prices paid for the granite and the granite-work
of the east and west porticoesvwould form a proper
schedule of prices for the northern portico.
I have the honor to remain, sir, very respectfully,
yours, â€¢ _ THOMAS U. WALTER,
Late Architect United Slates Capitol Extension, &c.
Hon. John H. Rice, Cltairmanof Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds, House of Representatives.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I also have a letter
here from the former Secretary of the Interior,
Mr. Usher, in which he concurs fully in the
facts stated here, that a new contract was in
fact entered into by which they were to have
fair compensation allowed them for these addi-
tional services; and the present architect of the
public buildings, Mr. Clark, concurs in the same
opinion. This whole matter is to be left to
the Secretary of the Interior for adjustment. I
understand the present Secretary of the Interior
has resigned; I do not know who may be the
next Secretary of the Interior. But with Mr.
Harlan I should certainly have felt the fullest
confidence that the whole matter would have
been adjusted on principles of right and equity.
Mr. PRICE. I would inquire if this bill
provides for an examination merely, or for
settlement and payment of the claim.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. For a settlement by
the Secretary of the Interior.
Mr. PRICE. I wish to amend by making
it that the Secretary of the Interior shall
examine and report to Congress at its next
session.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I prefer not to do
that.
Mr. DELANO. I desire to know of the
gentleman from Maine [Mr. Rice] whether
he himself has examined this question, and
whether from that examination he is prepared
to recommend the passage of this joint resolu-
tion.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. The committee of
which I am a member have carefully examined
the matter, and unanimously recommend the
passage of this joint resolution. In addition
to the quarries becoming filled with water, and
the engines and railways becoming decayed,
there was held back by the contract some
twelve thousand dollars as security. There-
fore they felt that they could not abandon their
contract, as tlicy would have liked to do in
consequence of the increase of the labor. The
former Secretary of the Interior made a new
contract for the marble-work for the Capitol
extension, without any direct authority of law.
for an amount very much larger than it is pro-
posed to pay to these gentlemen.
Mr. PRICE. I must object to this joint res-
olution because it opens the door without any
kind of restriction ; and when we come back
here at the next session we may discover that
many thousands of dollars have been paid out
for whieli no person is responsible.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. As the gentleman
from Maine [Mr. Rice] states that the com-
mittee of which he is the chairman have thor-
oughly investigated this matter, I would ask
him how much these persons claim of the Gov-
ernment.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. They claim sixty per
cent.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. How much is that?
Mr. RICE, of Maine. We cannot tell, for
the work is still going on.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. Have these parties
never stated the aggregate amount of their
claim ?
Mr. RICE, of Maine. They have not, for it
is impossible for them to state it.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. Is this increase of
sixty per cent, to run through the entire eon-
tract until the work is completed?
Mr. RICE, of Maine. That is to be left to
the Secretary of the Interior.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I am not willing to
leave that to the Secretary of the Interior or to
any other officer of the Government.
Mr. DELANO. If the gentleman from Maine
[Mr. Rice] will allow me, I will say that I ant
satisfied this claim needs a more thorough
examination and a more mature deliberation
than it is possible for this House to give it to-
night. I am sure, from what I have heard and
know of thecase, that if weactupon it to-night
we will be doing injustice to the Government,
And with the permission of the gentleman from
Maine I will move to refer this joint resolution
to the Committee of the Whole on the Private
Calendar. I think it is- due to ourselves that
a question involving so much money should
have some examination. It is now nearly three
o'clock in the morning, and we should not be
called upon to vote for a claim which will take
we do not know how much money out of the
Treasury.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I will yield to allow
that motion to be made, although I think it is
doing great injustice to these parties. And I
do not see why a report from the Committee
on Public Buildings and Grounds should not
be received with as much respect as reports
from other committees.
Mr. PRICE. I do not desire to treat the
committee with any disrespect. But the chair-
man of the committee cannot state how much
money this is to take, and therefore I am not
now prepared to vote upon it.
Mr. DELANO. I now move that this joint
resolution bo referred to the Committee of the
Whole on the Private Calendar.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. DELANO moved to reconsider the vote
by which the joint resolution was referred; and
also moved to lay the motion to reconsider on
the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
HENRY S. DAVIS.
Mr. RICE, of Maine, from the Committee
on Public Buildings and Grounds, reported a
bill for the relief of Ilenry S. Davis; which
was read a first and second time, referred to
the Committee oftlie Whole on the Private Cal-
endar, and ordered to be printed.
pcblisiiino lavrs of dakota.
Mr. RICE, of Maine. I ask leave to report
from the Committee on Territories a bill to
provide for the publication oftlie laws of Dakota
Territory.
Mr. CONKLING. Let the bill be read.
The bill was read at length. It authorizes
the secretary of the Territory of Dakota to
expend a sum of money not exceeding Â§8,000
out of the amount now on hand and saved out
of the appropriations heretofore made for the
support of the government in said Territory, for
the purpose of publishing the laws enacted at
the last session of the Legislature of the Ter-
ritory of Dakota.
Mr. BURLEIGH. Let me say a word of
explanation. .This bill does not ask for the
appropriation of a dollar of the public money.
The Legislature of Dakota passed a joint, reso-
lution asking to be allowed to expend a sum of
money for this purpose that has been saved out
of moneys heretofore appropi iated. A bill for
this purpose was diawn up and referred to a
committee, but the member of the committee
who was put in charge of it went away and the
bill could not be found. I drow up another
bill, which was referred to the Committee on
Territories, who acted favorably upon it; but
a member of the committee has carried that
bill away "frith liim. I have now drawn up
another bill, providing that the secretary of
the Territory may be allowed to expend a sum
not exceeding Â§8,000, of money that Las been
saved out of appropriations heretofore made,
for the purpose of publishing the new code,
the New York code, which was adopted by the
Legislature of Dakota last winter.
Mr. CONKLING. I have this suggestion
to make to the gentleman (rom Dakota, [Mr.
Brill.K!an:] we are constantly improving our
code in New York, and it will be a great deal
better ami more valuable nest winter tliau it
is now.
