COLUMBIA, S. C., February 12, 1865-9. 02 p. m.

Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE,

Commanding Department, Charleston, S. C.:

General Stevenson informs me he will commence retiring to-night on Kingsville and this place. You must hold enemy in check behind Four Hole Swamp and Sandy Run to the Santee, and effectively guard crossings of that river to the Westeree, or enemy may reach Northestern Railroad before your movement shall have been completed; hence necessity of prompt action on your part. I will leave here to-morrow, if possible, to join you.

G. T. BEUREGARD.

COLUMBIA, S. C., February 12, 1865-10 p. m.

Lieutenant General W. J. HARDEE,

Commanding Department, Charleston, S. C.:

Have already informed you where Wheeler's cavalry is, in obedience to your instructions, as he reports. I have ordered him to return, but you must rely on other arrangements for the protection of the flank referred to.

G. T. BEUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, [February] 12, 1865.

Major-General McLAWS:

In consequence of the movements of the enemy on the coast you will retire from your position at once, falling back in this direction. Send what is left of Conner's brigade to this point, and also Fiser's brigade; cars will be sent to George's Station or any other point you may designate for these troops. Answer.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

Place Fiser's brigade on the train which has been sent for that purpose, and hold it at Ridgeville Station subject to order.
