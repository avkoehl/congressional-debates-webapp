Weil, sir, theie lasóme truth in all that but how did «happen?
It was brought about in a great measme, by the gentleman's

foenator fiom Ohio, not now a member of this body* pitched
the tune, and, the gentleman and his fi. lends sungto it witha
vengeance The revenue had accumulated, to such an extent,
and the Treasury was m such a fioun hmg state; the gentleman
said we should be ruined if we did not do something to lessen it,
the political doctois said the patient was in a plethoia, if some
thing was not done, the suffeier would die of the diopb)
there was a general consultation among them, and they recom
mended copious blood letting To be sure they did allow us hre
millions over the necessary wants ot the Government, all the
re*t was let off 1 was m much doubt at the time, though I
voted for it I thought they might be right for once, and being
willing to do all I cculdto íeheve the patient, I went with them,
though somewhat against my own judgment
