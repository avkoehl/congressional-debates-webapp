General GRIERSON:

General Wilson promised, that if my forces were not sufficient to suppress marauding parties in my vicinity during the present armistice, to furnish me a force to co-operate with him of that purpose. Can you do the same immediately, until I can get a courier to him? A strong force is necessary at this post to suppress riot and preserve public stores as well as private.
