General Warren is directed to send his artillery by the road to Armstrong's (these headquarters), where Major Duane will furnish a guide. Your artillery should be at the same point, to follow General Warren's. It should be careful not to obstruct the road so as to interfere with Warren's artillery. It will rejoin you on the Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania Court-House road. You will follow Warren to near Bevery's, in the vicinity of which his attack will be prepared. From Bevery's guide will lead you to the Massaponax Church road, over an open country. Upon this road your attack is to be made. Captain Paine will furnish you a guide. He will be sent you immediately. One of our scouts reported that two regiments of the enemy's cavalry were at F. Anderson's to-day, 2 1/2 miles from Massaponax Church. I will send you my map to look at. Please return it.
