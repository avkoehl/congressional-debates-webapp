Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The notice you propose to give in regard to visitors will answer all purposes. I propose for the present that all persons landing at City Point, Petersburg, and Richmond shall register their names at officers to be established at those places. It will be well to put this in your notice.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The people of Richmond have thus far conducted themselves with great propriety, and are most respectful to the United States authorities. The desire for the complete restoration of the Federal authority in the State seems to be very general here; nevertheless, so large a population entirely without employment and generally without any means is most undesirable, if not dangerous. I am, therefore, sending into the country all who have homes or friends to go to. As there are no means of conveyance here they will be taken to convenient points in public wagons. In this way I hope to soon diminish the issue of provisions. There are, however, thousands here who have a small supply on hand, but no means of purchasing more.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I will give to the French authorities every possible facility for the removal of their tobacco. In the present condition of this city there is danger of fires, and the sooner it is removed the better. Our forces will give all necessary protection to vessels and workmen employed in the removal. I, therefore, see no necessity for the presence of a French gun-boat, which might lead to complications. I think an agent of the Treasury Department should be sent here to see that the removal includes no tobacco not belonging to the French Government. Whatever such agent may designate will be permitted full exit.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
