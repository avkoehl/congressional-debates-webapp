artillery, stores, and material. Only part of the officers and men arrived at Harper's Ferry. Since this retreat from Martinsburg and Winchester, General Schenck has also reported re-enforcement sent from Baltimore to Harper's Ferry. General Schenck reported last evening, "Maryland Heights and Harper's Ferry are held behind strong works by nearly 7000 men. " It would appear from this that of the troops reported at Harper's Ferry May 31,

June 8, and June 10, and those which have since been sent there from other places, there are left only "nearly 7, 000 men. " You will report how these statements conform to the results of your inspection, what has become of the missing men, and also, so far as you can ascertain, the facts in relation to General Milroy's retreat from Winchester.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

The indications are that the enemy is massing about 12, 000 cavalry and artillery in Culpeper County for a raid. Deserters say the men have been given to understand that it is to be a long and desperate one. I can only repeat the recommendation so often made to you, to mass your troops more in convenient places for rapid and concerted operations, holding railroad bridges only with small detachments in block-houses, and exposing no large forces in advanced positions where they are liable to be cut off. We probably shall not know the direction or intention of this raid till it is actually in motion; hence the necessity of keeping your forces well in hand for a sudden movement.

HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY, Washington, D. C.,June 11, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

Harper's Ferry is the important place. Winchester is of no importance other than as a lookout. The Winchester troops, excepting enough to serve as an outpost, should be withdrawn to Harper's Ferry. The troops at Martinsburg should also be ready to fall back on Harper's Ferry. No large amount of supplies should be left in any exposed position.
