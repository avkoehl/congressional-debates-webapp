THE CONGKESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 25,
able Senators. It has been pressed upon us
t>y that lion whieh roars sometimes, as we
beard from an honorable Senator awhile ago ;
it lias been pressed upon us by the roaring
lion of the lobby, with an assiduity, with a
pertinacity, with an enterprise never aqualled
during my brief experience in this body as far
as I know. Every stone has been turned,
every nerve has been strained, every confusion
has been produced, to which effort was added.
And now at last, Mr. President, it seems
to me the facts lead inexorably to the conclu-
sion that this is the naked case of a party seek-
ing subsidies, who not only has no special or
extraordinary right, but who stands already as
the recipient of great Congressional favor. So
regarding it, it falls in my estimation within
that category, within that class of measures
forbidden, not by a ranting and affected econ-
omy, not by a mode of conducting legislation
properly the subject of criticism anywhere, but
forbidden by that conscientious circumspection
which behooves every man now when called to
pass upon a question between the burdened
people of this country and claimants approach-
ing the public Treasury. It seems to me, Mr.
President, if there be anything in the preten-
sions of gentlemen, if there be any deference
to the public judgment, if there be any respect
for the facts in the presence of which we stand,
anything in the situation of the nation groan-
ing under a burden of taxation which every
man is compelled to remember, there is some-
thing which should take effect upon a measure
like this.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. President, I desire
to say but a very few words  
Mr. DIXON. Will the Senator allow me to
offer an amendment to be printed?
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Certainly.
â€¢ SUFFRAGE CONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT.
\ Mr. DIXON. I gave notice on Saturday of
an amendment to the resolution proposing an
amendment to the Constitution affecting suf-
frage in the several States. I now ask that the
amendment be priuted. It is in line four, to
strike out the words "Legislatures in the sev-
eral States" and insert "conventions in the
several States to be elected in the manner
prescribed by the laws of said States," and in
line six to strike out the word "Legislatures"
and insert" conventions.'' I submit this amend-
ment for the purpose of having it printed with
the other amendments.
The amendment was received, and ordered
to be printed.
WESTERN MILITARY CLAIMS.
Mr. TRUMBULL. If tiie Senator from
"Wisconsin will give way for a moment, J desire
to call attention to a joint resolution 011 whieh

Mr. DOOLITTLE. I will yield if the pend-
ing measure is not displaced.
On motion by Mr. TRUMBULL, the Sen-
ate proceeded to consider its amendment to
the joint resolution (H. R. No. 404) providing
for the disposition of certain papers relating
to the military claims accruing in the depart"
ment of the West, disagreed to by the House
of Representatives.
On motion by Mr. TRUMBULL, it was
Resolvd, That the Senate insist upon its amend-
ment to the said resolution disagreed to by the IIouso
of Representatives, and agree to the conference asked
by the House on the disagreeing votes of tho two
Houses thereon.
Ordered, That the conferees on the part of the Sen-
ate be appointed by the President pro tempore.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. Mr. President  
Mr. FliELINGHUYSEN. With the per-
mission of the Senator, I will move an adjourn-
ment.
Mi. DOOLITTLE. I do not wish to pre-
vent the taking of the sense of the Senate on
that subject if they feel disposed to vote on
that motion. I will yield to allow the sense
of the Senate to be taken on that question.
Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I move that the
Senate adjourn.
Mr. SHERMAN. I give notice that I shall
try to get up the finance bill to-morrow.

that the Senate do now adjourn.
