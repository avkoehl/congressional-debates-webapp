HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, New Hope, October 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,Commanding Cavalry, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: According to your instructions I have sent a force to watch the enemy, following through Dallas to Van Wert; also a force to the right to examine the country between the Etowah and Van Wert. These troops cannot, in all probability, return to-day, and I will remain in this camp. To-morrow I would like to move down on the valley of the Etowah for forage, and I can be within ten miles of Acworth and six or seven of Allatoona. I can be on the Pumpkin Vine, near where the old Allatoona road crosses.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding DIVISION.

I think Blue Mountain is the place the enemy has gone; the cavalry burnt the bridges over the Pumpkin Vine on the roads leading from Dallas, and left their camps in the forenoon yesterday.

(Received 4 p. m.)

Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT,Chief of Cavalry, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: Your note ordering me toward Stilesborough and the valley of the Etowah has just been received. To-morrow I will move and have my camp somewhere on the old Alabama road and east of the Euharlee. Will scout the roads to Rome and Van Wert. Yesterday my men were within seven miles of Van Wert, on the Stilesborough and Van Wert road, and saw only a few pickets. At that time the pickets of the enemy's cavalry were near Dallas, on the Villa Rica and Van Wert road. From these and other facts I think Blue Mountain is their destination. To-night I will have parties in who have been in Van Wert to-day, if the enemy is not too strong on the road there. I have had parties out in every direction and six miles toward Powder Springs, but can hear nothing of Kilpatrick except he is in camp some eight miles from Marietta. The enemy are in great fear, from what I learn, that Sherman will cut them off from Blue Mountain by a move out through Carrollton,

Very respectfully, &c.,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding DIVISION.
