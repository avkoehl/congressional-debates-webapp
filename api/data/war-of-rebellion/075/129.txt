HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Camp in Sugar Valley, May 10, 1864-5 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Commanding Div., 20th A. C., at West Entrance to Snake Creek Gap:

GENERAL: You will post one of your regiments on the mountain toward the east end of the gap, not far from the letter "M" or "O" in the word "mountain" east of Villanow. This will prevent the occupation of this portion of the mountain by rebel sharpshooters, which would render the pass dangerous. I have only had pickets along on these points, but the enemy is extending his vedettes all around us, except in the west, watching all our movements and evidently trying to make out our force. We have had more or less skirmishing all day with rebel cavalry. The road through the pass must be kept open, and unnecessary wagons kept to the rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,La Fayette, May 10, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN, Commanding:

GENERAL: I will move on to-day through Ship's Gap. I have heard nothing from General McPherson, but know that his troops passed through Gordon's and Ship's Gaps. My artillery and wagons are not up. I should receive orders from General McPherson somewhere to-day. I have sent several parties after him to communicate.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
