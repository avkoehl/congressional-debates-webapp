act, issuing notes calculated or intended to circu-
'late as money, shall, on the first day of July next,
and regularly on the first days of January and
July thereafter, make and deliver to the Comp-

business, such association is hereby authorized
to issue and circulate the same as money; and the
same shall be received at par in ail parts of the

troller of the Currency to keep in his office a book
in which shall be entered the name of every as-
sociation from whose account such transfer of
bonds is made by the Treasurer, and the name of
the party to whom such transfer is made, unless

fact shall be stated in said book, and in either case
the par value of the bonds so transferred shall be
entered therein; and it shall be the duty of the

during office hours access to the books of the
Treasurer for the purpose of ascertaining the cor-
rectness of the transfer or assignment presented
to him to countersign; and the Treasurer shall
have the like access to the book above mentioned
kept by the Comptroller during office hours to
ascertain the correctness of the entries in the same.
Sec. 23. And be it further enacted, That it shall
be the duty of either the president or cashier of
every bankingassociation having stocks deposited
in the office of the Treasurer of the United States,
once or more in each fiscal year, and at such time
or times during the ordinary business hours as
said officer or officers may select, to examine and
compare the bonds so pledged with the books of
said Department, and, if found correct, to execute
to the said Treasurer a certificate setting forth the
different kinds and the amounts thereof, and that
the same are in the possession and custody of the
Treasurer at the date of such certificate. Such
examination may be made by an agent of such
association, duly appointed in writing for that
purpose, whose certificate before mentioned shall
be of like force and validity as if executed by such
president or cashier.
Sec. 24. And be it further enacted, That every
association issuing circulating notes under the pro-
visions of this act shall make a quarterly report
to the Comptroller of the Currency, commencing
on the first day of the quarter of the year next suc-
ceeding the organization of such association, and
continuing on the first days of each succeeding*
quarter in every year thereafter, which report
shall be verified by the oath or affirmation of the
president and cashier; and all willful false swear-
ing in respect to such report shall be perjury, and
subject to the punishment prescribed by law for
such offense. The report hereby required shall

Comptroller to publish full abstracts of such re-
ports together in two newspapers, to be designated
by him for that purpose, one in the city of Wash-
ington and the other in the city of .New York,
exhibiting the items of capital, circulation, and
deposits, specie and cash items, public securities
and private securities; and the sepaiate report of
each association shall be publishedina newspaper

such association shall at any time fail to redeem,
in the lawful money of the United States, any of
its circulating notes, when payment thereof shall
be lawfully demanded, during the usual hours of
business, at the office of such association, the
holder may cause the same to be protested, in one
package, by a notary public, unless the president
or cashier of the association shall offer to waive
demand and notice of the protest, and shall, in
pursuance of such offer, make, sign, and deliver
to the party making such demand an admission
in writing, stating the time of the demand, the
amount demanded, and the fact of the non-pay-
ment thereof; and such notary public, on making
such protest, or upon receiving such admission,
shall forthwith forward such admission or notice
of protest to the Comptroller of the Currency; and
after such default it shall not be lawful for the as-
sociation suffering the same to pay out any of its
notes, discount any notes or bills, or otherwise
prosecute the business of banking, except to re-
ceive and safely keep money belonging to it, and
to deliverspecial deposits: Provided, however,That
if satisfactory proof be produced to such notary
public that the payment of any such notes is re,
strained by order of any court of competent juris-
diction, such notary public shall not protest the
same; and when the holder of such notes shall
cause more than one note or package to be pro-
tested on the same day, he shall not reoeive pay
for more than one protest.
Sec. 26. And be U further enacted, That on,re-
ceiving notice that any such association has failed
to redeem any ofits circulating notesj as specified
in the next preceding section, the Comptrolleriof
the Currency, with the concurrence of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, may appoint a special agent,
(of whose appointment immediate notice .shall be
given to such association,) who shall immediately
proceed to ascertain whether such association has
refused to pay its circulating notes, in the lawful
money of the United States, when demanded as
aforesaid, and report to the Comptroller the facta
so ascertained; and if, from such protest or the
reports so made, the Comptroller shall be satisfied
that such association has refused to pay its cir-
culating notes as aforesaid, and is in default, he
shall, within thirty days after he shall have re-
ceived notice of such failure, declare the United
States bonds and securities pledged by such asso-
ciation forfeited to the United States, and the same
shall thereupon be forfeited accordingly, and
thereupon the Comptroller shall immediately give
notice, in such manner as the Secretary of the
Treasury shall, by general rules or otherwise, di-
rect, to the holders 6f the circulating notes of such
association to present them for payment at the
Treasury of the United States; and the same shall
be paid as presented, whereupon said Comptroller
may, in his discretion, cancel an equal amount of
the bonds pledged by such association, equal at
current market rates, not exceeding par to the
notes paid; *nd it shall be lawful for the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, from time to time, to make
such regulations respecting the disposition to be
made of such circulating notes after presentation
thereof for payment as aforesaid, and respecting
the perpetuation of the evidence of the payment
thereof, as may seem to him proper; but all such
notes, on being paid, shall be canceled; and for
any deficiency in the proceeds of the bonds pledged
by such association, when disposed of as herein-
after specified, to reimburse to the United States
the amount so expended in paying the circulating
notes of such association, the United States shall
have a first and paramount lien upon all the assets
of such association, and such deficiency shall be
made good out of such assets in preference to any
and all other claims whatsoever, except the ne-
cessary costs and expenses of administering the
same.
Sec. 27. And be it further enacted, That when-
ever the Comptroller shall become satisfied, as in
the last preceding section specified, that any such
association has refused to pay its circulating notes
as therein mentioned, he*may, instead of cancel-

sociation, as provided in the next preceding sec-
tion, cause so much of them as may be necessary
to redeem the outstanding circulating notes of such
association to be sold at public auction in the city
of New York, after giving thirty days' notice of
such sale to such association.
Sec. 28. And be it further enacted, That the
Comptroller of the Currency may, if he shall be
of opinion that the interests of the United States
will be best promoted thereby, sell at private sale
any of the stock so transferred to him by such as-
sociation, and receive therefor either money or the
circulating notes of such failing association: Pro-
vided, That no such bonds shall be sold by pri-
vate sale for less than the par, nor less than the
market value thereof at the time of sale. And
provided further, That no sales of any such stock,
either public or private, shall be complete until
the transfer thereof shall have been made with
the formalities prescribed in this act.
Sec. 29. And be it further enacted, That on be-
coming satisfied, as specified in this act, that any
such association has refused to pay its circulating
notes as therein mentioned, and is in default, the
Comptroller of the Currency may forthwith ap-
point a receiver, and require of him such bond and
security as he shall deem proper, who, under the
direction of the Comptroller, shall take posses-
sion of the books, records, and assets of every
