I think, between here and 12 or 15 miles of New Berne. Scouts were sent out yesterday but have not yet been heard from. My pickets are where they were when you were here. They were ordered there yesterday at 1 o'clock. Heard from Colonel Lewis this morning. He makes no report of the enemy. I am trying to get information from New Berne. Will certainly keep you advised of everything I can hear of importance. The telegram sent you last night about the enemy at White Oak River was to General Robertson, from one of his captains, on picket on the opposite side. Major [J. H.] McNeill says he is reliable. The information was that from the noise he thought they were building a bridge there. The country was such that they could not see the enemy. I will open communication from there to General R. and will telegraph you anything that is important.

Very respectfully, &amp; c.,

JUNIUS DANIEL,

Brigadier-General.
