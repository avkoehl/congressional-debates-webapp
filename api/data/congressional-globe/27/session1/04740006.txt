credit and the finances of the Government to lend
their indirect but efficient aid in sustaining the cre-
dit, and regulating the currency of the country, it
brings into direct hostility those important inte-
rests. In the progress of the system a sufficient
amount of gold and silver to supplj the wants of
the Treasury must be withdrawn from circulation,
and locked up m vaults, leaving no representative
to supply its place in the general circulation.
A large amount, also, in the hands of those who
pay to or receive from the Treasury, is equally
withdrawn from general circulation, and made to
flow through those channels alone which lead into
and out of the public coffers Tbe other avenues
of commerce and intercourse are thus deprived of
their proportion of the precious metals
Within the fifty-two years during which our con-
stitutional Government has existed, we have had,
for two periods of twenty years eachj a bank char-
tered  by Congress as a depository of the   public
moneys and as sfi*cal agent    Wt have had, also,
at two intervals, amounting to about nine years,
State banks employed for like purpises, and, dar-
ing the remainder of the time,  the funds of the
Government have been kept and th  finances ad-
ministered partly by banks and partly by indivi-
dual officers and agents.   The losses sustained by
State banks, as depositories, during the first period
of  their employment, extending from   1811   to
1816, agreeably to a statement prepared  by the
Secretary of the Treasury  in  1833, and  revised
and  republished in  1833   were $1,000,676      In
the latter period, from  1833 to 1837, through no
actual loss is believed to have occured, yet the
Treasury and the country suffered inconvenience
ana embarrassment from the fioeal arrangements
with those numerous and disconnected institutions
But, during the forty years that the two banks of the
United States were the depositories ot the  public
money and the fiscal agents of the Government,
no loss whatever was sustained, nor any delay or
any expense incurred in transmitting or disbursing
the public moneys, so far as the agency of tho«e
institutions extended    Then, as legards th  wants
of the Treasury merely, ihe  safety of  the public
funds, and economy in their administration, expe-
rience has demonstrated the superior utility of a
bank constituted and adopted by Congress as a
fiscal agent    It has also proved to us that the ac-
tive business of the country, its currency, its cre-
dit, its industry, and us commerce, are intimately
connected with and dependent upon the financial
arrangements of the General Government    If they
be wise and beneficent, th y indirectly, but efli-
ciently, promote those great interests of the p"C-
ple, if constant and umíerm m their action,  they
give to those interests confidence and slab hty.
Since the removal of th  public deposites from
the Bank of the United States, in 1833, the Go-
vernment has had no permanent fiscal agent and
no definite financial system. All has been experi-
ment, transfer, and change. The business of the
country has yielded to the unsteady impulse, and
moved forward with wild irregularity, at one time
stimulated to excessive action, at another sunk
into lethargy And, in providing for the wants of
the Treasury, it is surely important to lcok, also,
to the wants and the welfare of the community,
from the products of whose industry the Treasuiy
is supplied.
And as regards those great interests, we find the
testimony of past years is no less distinct and strong
in favor of a moneyed institution chattered by the
General Government, and possessed of its confi-
dence and credit The period embracing the last
ten years of the existence of the late Bank of the
United States as the fiscal agent, is fresh in the
memory of us all, and is looked back to as a period
cf great public prosperity, and though other causes
did, doubtless, co-operate to produce that favorable
condition of things, yet one of tfip governing princi-
ples on which depended the s'eady advance of the
country m commerce, in industry, and in substan
tial weahh, was the existence of a fiscal agent esta-
blished by the General Government, and charged
with the equalization of exchanges, and the regula
tion of the currency.
In the present condition of our country, the re-
lief to be anticipated from such an institution can-
not be immedia'e, but must bo tre work cf tim°
The business of the country would, however, in ihe
opinion of the undefined, steadily and certainly
revive under us influence
In whatever point of light the. undersigned is
able to view this subject, he is irresistibly led to the
conclusion that such fiscal agent, so iramed as to
possess those important functions, is alike essential
to the wants of the Treasury and of the communi-
ty Such an m titntion should be framed with de-
liberation, for it must have h gh duties to perform,
and extensive interests to protect and promote, and
it should be gianted with care, for it will be liable
to great and dangerous abuse  As the fiscal agent
oí the Government, and an effective regulator of
the currency m a wide spread communty,it should
be steady and unitoim in its actioD, and fixed and
stable in its character
The undersigned has no doubt of the power of
Congress to create *uch an mstitutie n Experience
has proved its n°ces ty to «Mrry oot other expr^'sly
granted pon ei*, it has been exercised and r^cojnioed
by the Legislative and Executive departments of
the Government daring four fifths of the whole
period of our national existence and it has re-
ceived the uniform sauction of our highest judicial
tribunal
Yet that poorer has been questioned by many
wise and patriotic statesmen whoie opinions are
entitled to consideration and respect, and in a mea-
sure like this, cf h'gh political import, which, if
widely conceived and cordnlly concurred in, miist
have a great and endunn? mfluenc on the prospe
rity of the country, it is impoitant, ns far as poss.
ble, to   bviate olj c u ns and reconcile opmioi
It such an institution cau be o conceived m
principle and guarded in it  deiaus as to remove all
scruples touehiug the question of constitutional
power, and thus avoid the objections which have
been urged against those herete f< le created by
Congress, it will m the opinion of the undersigned,
produee the hd¡ i lest results and confer last ngana
important benefit on the country
The undersiguel, th efore, respectfully recom-
mends the creation of such fi eal agent, and the re-
peal of ¡he act of July 4 h, 1840, providing ' 'or
the collection, safe keeping, tranifer, and disburse-
ment of the public revenue," except the penal pio-
visions thereof, which will probably require revi-
sion and modification
All which is respectfully submitted

REPORT OF THE SECRETARY OF WAR
DtPlRTMENT OP War,
May 31 1841.
Sir I propose to bnnj' to your no ice, at the
present time cily such matters confided to the
supeuntencence of tht Department of "War as,
from their natu e or p essing emergency, or from
the general ir-terfs, they excite, you may deem
pioper to communicate for the information of Con-
gress and the public
Although tbe mspec ons directed since the ad-
journment of Cong ess have been mace with he
gr( atesi promptness and furnish ?n extensive body
of information mi gird to the state of the public
defer ces, as v ell as to the d «c phne and efficiency
of ihe arm/, and bear full and atisfactory testi-
mony to tn impoitance cf the Inspector's Depart
ment, jet <r m the limited time allowed, and the
immense extent of lerntoiy over which the nume
rous establishments connected with the military
service are distributed the inspections are neces
sarily mcompl te, and it is, therefire, not designed
to notice all the considerations suggested by the in-
formation .they añora, until a future occasion
In the genera1 condition and disposit on of the
army, there h^sbeen no material ciange since the
la-t annua! report from this Department The re-
gular force stationed in Florida, consisting of eight
regiments, and number ng, in the aggregate, by
the last reiurns, five thousand and fifty-seven, it
has been round expedient to continue m service in
that Territory.
A few incursions by small detachments of our
troops into the fastnesses of the enemy, by which
their atrocities have been signally visited upon their
own heads, have been the only exceptions to the
general cessation of hostilities which took place
last fall, soon after the  regiments, remfoiced by
new recruits and provided with   every necessary
supply, were prepared for active operations, nor
have they been renewed since that time.   Offers to
negotiate from several chiefs, the device by which
those crafty warriors have so   often  baffled  cur
arms at the period most propitious to success, «ere
renewed under such circumstances as induced the
commanding general once more to embrace them.
The strongest confidence appears to have been felt
that, with the aid of a suitable  amount of funds,
applicable to that object,  the whole of the hostile
bands might soo.i be persuaded  to surrender, and
abandon the country    This line of policy, though
tardy in its   result^, continued   to hold  out  such
he pes of complete success is to encourage the late
Adminisuation in  the belief that this protracted
war had at last been brut ght so near a close as to
be no longer a   >ubject   of parucu'ar   interest oi
anxiety     For ihese íeasons it  was not thought ex
pedient to check or interrupt the negotiations in
progress on the 4ih of March last, by directing a
different mode  of operations     The result so far,
since the negotiat ons were renewed in the fall, his
been the surrender of four hundred and thirty-one
Indians, including about one hundred warriors, all
of whom have been transported to the country as-
signed them, west of   be M «sissjppi     Some  ex
pectation is still indulged by the officer m command
that the remaining bands which have so  long in-
fested the upper and  noi them districts of the pen-
insula will surrender in a short time, but I regret
to state that but little hope can be justly cherished
that this unhappy and wasteful war, which has al-
ready cost so great a number of valuable lives, and
so many millions of public treasure, will be termi-
nated without still further sacrifices    It appears
that, af er six months of negotiation, no access has
been had to ihe principal and most powerfuj, chief,
or to any of his followers    Directions have ac-
crrdmJy been given for trie most energetic and ef-
fective prosecution of the war the moment further
negotiations shall appear to be useless    Steps have
also been taken to increase the efficiency of the
means now at the di posal of   he officer ia com-
mand, and, in the mean time, the retrenchment of
every expenditure connected with the service, for
purposes not essential in Indian warfare, has been
earnestly enjoined
The many weighty cons derations which invite
the immediate attention of Congress to the subject
of the public defences generall), and particularly
to the works absolu ely necessary to the security of
our great ccmmercial emporiums, and the keys to
our most valuable resources of every kind, must be
so generally understood and appreciated that no-
thing this Department can urge could add any thing
to their force and conclusiveness To say nothing of
the destruction of property, and our weakened con-
dition in a military point Of view, attendant
upon the carrying of any of our most assailable
points, the penetration of our territory and the seiz-
ure of even one of our strongholds by a powerful
enemy upon the sudden outbreak of war, it would
seem to be equally the dictate of patriotism and
wisdom to make due provision against the inflic-
tion of such insults to the national honor and cha-
racter
It has been urged as an objection to the further
progress of the works Heretofore projected for the
deferce of our extensive sea-eoast, that the recent
experiments in the use of steam power in the ocean
navigation, and the ready application of the 'ame
powerful agent to the defence of our principal har-
bors, together with the late inventions in the means
of increasing the üestnictiveness of shells, must
soon introduce an ent re change m the system of
coast defence, as well as the maritime war in gene-
ral It is true that the mental activity character-
istic of the age in every oUer art and science, has
not been less fruitful in suggesting ímprovemei s
in the art of war, the value of some of which has
already been tested in practice, and doubtless others
will, in time, prove equally successful. In no de
partment of public affairs may the natural connec
tion and  dependence  between   all the  sciences
