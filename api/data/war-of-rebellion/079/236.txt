HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Athens, Ala., October 12, 1864-10 a. m.

Captain RAMSEY,

Asst. Adjt. General, Major-General Thomas' Staff:

Your dispatch of this date received one mile WEST of Athens. The head of my DIVISION is now passing through the town. I will move to ridge port with all possible dispatch. My men are a good deal broken down from excessive rains and bad roads; many of them bare footed. I left Florence by order of Major-General Rousseau on the morning of the 10th instant. All your dispatches sent me beyond Athens were lost or captured. One of my dispatches from Shoal Creek was lost in Elk River. I forwarded through General Stark weather, at Pulaski, duplicate copy of this dispatch, which I hope you have received. If possible, I would like railroad transportation for my broken-down men. I am in hopes to hear from you at Huntsville. I will be here till 12 m. to-day.

J. D. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

NASHVILLE, October 12, 1864.

Brigadier-General MORGAN,

Athens:

Transportation has been ordered for you this morning to take your command from Athens. I thought that the dispatch would have certainly reached you before the time of sending yours of this a. m. If you have reached Huntsville you can wait there for the cars, and if any of your command are left back at Athens, can be sent up on the railroad. Your whole command goes to Chattanooga.

ROBT. H. RAMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
