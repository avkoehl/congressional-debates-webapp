General HALLECK, Washington;

My eastern front is threatened. My pickets at Solomon's Gap shelled out. The ball will open to-morrow morning. Force opposing me is estimated at ten regiments of infantry with proportionate artillery, before dusk; otherse have come into camp since. General White will abandon Martinsburg some time to-night, and I expect this will be the last you will hear of me until this affair is over. All are cheeful and hopeful. Good-bye.

MARTINSBURG, September 11, 1862.

Colonel MILES:

I have sent out a strong reconnaissance of all arms toward Williamsport. I have no solicitude except for my camp equipage and subsistence stores. The brigade has only sixteen wagons. I think it prudent to send up the train you speak of by midnight if the telegraph should be cut. I cannot transport the Government property otherwise.

J. WHITE.

Brigadier-General.
