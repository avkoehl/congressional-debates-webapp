CITY POINT, August 20, 1864 - 1.50 p. m.

General HANCOCK:

You will cross at Point of Rocks. If material for a bridge at Broadway Landing can be raked together one will be thrown across there. Of this you will soon be advised.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 20, 1864 - 2.45 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I sent you a dispatch this morning, asking whether I was to go back by way of Bermuda Hundred Landing, as might be implied from the order, or whether it was intended I should cross at Point of Rocks by the usual route. Thinking you may not have received the dispatch, I repeat the substance.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,August 20, 1864 - 3 p. m. (Received 3.37 p. m.)

Major-General HANCOCK:

Lieutenant-General Grant desires me to say that there will be two bridges for you to cross the Appomattox on, one at Point of Rocks, the other at Broadway, and that thus, with the two bridges at Deep Bottom, you will have two roads for your movement. I think but one of the bridges at Deep Bottom is prepared for wagons.

C. B. COMSTOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

CITY POINT, August 20, 1864 - 3.10 p. m.

(Received 3.35 p. m.)

General HANCOCK:

A pontoon will be laid at Broadway Landing this evening, and will be ready for you two hours after dark.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, August 20, 1864 - 4 p. m.

(Received 4.26 p. m.)

General HANCOCK:

The words Bermuda Hundred should not have occurred in my dispatch. As Colonel Comstock telegraphed there will be two bridges across the Appomattox, one at Point of Rocks and one at Broadway, and you should take the best route from Deep Bottom to them.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
