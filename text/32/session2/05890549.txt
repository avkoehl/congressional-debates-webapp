Pravei by the Rev. James Gallaiier.
The Journal of yesterday was rea J and approved.
A message was received from the House of
Representatives, by Mr. Forney, its Clerk, an-
nouncing that it had agreed to the amendments of
the Senate to the bill of the House to amend the
act entitled " An act to create the office of sur-
' veyor genera! of the public lands in Oregon, to
' provide for the survey, and make donations to

COUNTING THE ELECTORAL VOTES.
The twelfth amendment to the Constitution of
the United States provides that the electoral col-
leges shall make distinct lists of all persons voted
for as President and Vice President, and of the
number of votes for each, " which lists they shall
' sign and certify, and transmit sealed to the seat
' of the Government of the United States, directed
' to the President of the Senate; the President of
' the Senate shall, in presence of the Senate and
' House of Representatives, open all the certifi-
' cates, and the votes shall then be counted; the
' person having the greatest number of votes for
• President shall be the President, if such num-
• ber be a majority of the whole number of electors
■ appointed." The same provision is applied to
the election of Vice President.
The act of Congress approved March 1, 1792,
section 2, provides that "  he electors shall meet
' and give their votes on the said first Wednesday
' in December, at such place in each State as
' shall be directed by the Legislature thereof; and
' the electors in each Slate shall make and sign
' three certificates of all the votes by them given,
' and shall seal up the same, certifying on each
' that a list of the votes of such State, for Presi-
' dent and Vice President, is contained therein;
' and shall, by writing under their hands, or under
' the hands of a majority of them, appoint a per-
■ son to take charge of and deliver to the Presi-
' dent of the Senate, at the seat of Government, be-
« fore the first Wednesday in January then next
' ensuing, one of the said certificates; and the
'said electors shall forthwith forward, by the
' post office, to the President of the Senate, at the
' seat of Government, one other of the said cer-
' tificates; and shall forthwith cause the other of
' the said certificates to be delivered to the judge
' of that district in which the said electors shall
' assemble."
A joint committee having been appointed by the
Senate and House of Representatives to ascertain
and report a mode of examining the votes for
President and Vice President of the United States,
and of notifying the persons elected of their elec-
tion, under these provisions of law and of the
Constitution, the following resolution was re-
ported and approved, and the tellers appointed
were Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, on the part of the
Senate, and Mr. George W. Jones, of Tennes-
see, and Mr. Joseph R. Chandler, of Pennsyl-
vania, on the part of the House:
" Resolved, That the two Houses will assemble in the
Chamber of the House of Representatives on Wednesday,
the 9th instant, at twelve o'clock, and the President of the
Senate pro tempore shall be the presiding officer; that one
person be appointed a teller on the part of the Senate, and
two on the part of the House of Representatives, to make
a list of the votes as they shall be declared; that the result
shall be delivered to the President of the Senate pro tem-
pore, who shall announce the state of the vote, and the
persons elected, to the two Houses assembled, as aforesaid,
which shall be deemed a declaration of the persons elected
President and Vice President of the United States, and, to-
gether with a list of votes, be entered on the Journals of
the two Houses."
A message having been received from the House
of Representatives by Mr. Forney, its Clerk,
announcing that the House of Representatives
was ready to receive the Senate, in conformity to
the Constitution and in compliance with the order
of the two Houses, for the purpose of opening
and counting the votes of the electors of the several
States for President and Vice President of the
United States, the Senate proceeded to the Cham-
ber of the House of Representatives, preceded by
its President and other officers.
The Senators having returned to their Chamber,
the President resumed the chair.
Mr. HUNTER. The tellers appointed by the
two Houses to count the votes for President and
Vice President of the United States have in-
structed me to make a further report:
Resolved, That a committee of one member of the Senate | j
be appointed by that body, to join a committee of two inern- .
bers of the House of Representatives, to be appomied by
the House, to wait on Franklin Pierce, of New Hamp- .
shire, and notify him that he has been duly elected Presi-
dent of the United States for four years, to commence on
tile 4th day of March, 1853.
The resolution was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to.
Mr. HUNTER. I move that the President of
the Senate, by unanimous consent, appoint the
committee on the part of the Senate.
The motion was agreed to; and Mr. Hunter
was appointed.
Mr. HUNTER. I am also instructed by the
same committee to report the following resolu-

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Wednesday, February 9, 1853.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m.
by the Rev. James Gallaher.
The Journal of yesterday was read.
Mr. MACE. I rise to a privileged motion.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I have a motion
to make, which is, perhaps, the highest privileged
motion that can be made this day.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will hear both.
Mr. MACE. I move to amend the Journal, by
expunging therefrom the whole proceedings of last
evening's session, because the same shows a spirit
of faction on the part of a factious minority, in
total disregard of the legitimate business of the
country, and highly disgraceful to the American
, Congress.
Mr. EVANS. I object to that motion.
The SPEAKER. Th e gentleman's proposition
is not, legitimately, to amend the Journal, and the
Chair rules it out of order. •
Mr. JONES. My motion is, that the Clerk of
the House inform the Senate that the House of
Representatives are now ready to receive the Pres-
: ident and Members of the Senate, to count the
votes for the late election of President and Vice
President of the United States, this being the day
fixed by the Constitution for that purpose.
The question was taken, and the motion was
agreed to.
The message was transmitted to the Senate.
At half past twelve o'clock, the Senate, pre-
ceded by the Hon. D. R. Atchison, its Pres-
ident pro tempore, and its officers, entered the Hall
of the House, to join the House of Representatives
in counting the votes for President and Vice Pres-
ident of the United States, in conformity to the
Constitution, and in pursuance of the following
joint resolution, heretofore adopted by the two
Houses:
" Resolved, That the two Houses will assemble in the
Chamber of the House of Representatives, on Wednesday,
the 9th instant, at twelve o'clock, and the President of the
Senate pro tempore shall be the presiding officer; that one
person be appointed a teller on the part of the Senate, and
two on the part of the House of Representatives, to make a
list of the votes as they shall be declared; that the result
shall be delivered to the President of the Senate pro tem-
pore who shall announce the state'of the vote, and the per-
sons'elected, to the two Houses assembled, as aforesaid,
which shall be deemed a declaration of the persons clected
