the Charles City and Nine-Mile roads. This move was to be carried out by daylight if possible. As it is very important, and as you have not replied to the telegram, I send this by a courier, though it is now too late to make the move before day. You will move at once and get into the position indicated above as soon as you can. The best road you could travel would be the military road just in rear of the intermediate line of works to the Nine-mile road and down that road to the works, whence you could extend over to the right to the Charles City road.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
