HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., October 19, 1864.

COLONEL: With the exception of mortar shelling last night, the enemy have been very quiet along my line during the last twenty-four hours. The casualties in Wise's brigade (annexed) occurred while the command was at work on a battery, and were inflicted by mortar shells. One deserter came in last night, and I regret to report that two men deserted from Gracie's brigade to the enemy. General Gracie says, however, that they were hospital rats, and but little injury is done to the country by their desertion.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Wise's brigade, wounded, 6; Gracie's brigade, wounded, 3.

Respectfully,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. PALMER, Assistant Adjutant-General.
