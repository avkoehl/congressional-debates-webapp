Mr WRIGHT hoped, before proceeding with thf observa
tiona which he was about to offer upon the bill now before the
Senate he would be permitted to remark that the circumstances

all"
under which the Senate adjourned yestesáay weifs somewhat .
peculiar, and he had noticed that Bomfr$&gve& of ¿bélrite had
been excited, in consequence of an inference having  been
wrongly drawn, that it was from personal cdnsideraEuons that
an adjournment had been proposed   He begged to1 saw ¿w he '
said before, that it Would have been more agreeable to inmseff
to have proceeded with what he intended to say, but that ha
had yielded to the motion for adjournment, in order to accoifi*
modate those who, taking a peculiar interest m the question 
were desirous of approaching its discussion with feelings re-
lieved from the fatigue which the lateness of the hour and thet
previous business of the day had imposed upon them    He was
aware how disagreeable a thing it was to listen to a dull arid
tiresome speech, when oppressed -with a feeling of exhaustion
and fatigue    For this reason, he could not ceitamly feel that
any discoui tesy towards himself had been manifested by thoeei
who voted for the adjournment                              m
At the time when the interruption occurred, he was remark-
ing upon the fourth section of the amended biU, and it would
not be necessary for him to recapitulate now what he had al-
ready said, as he would probably have occasion hereafter to re-
fer to this part of the subject    The question he was then cor-
sidering was as to the influence which this section of the act
would have upon the mode of obtaining proposals for loans 
This section, he contended, must measure and govern the terras
for proposals, in all cases and under all circumstances, and, the
honorable chairman of thefinance committee seeming to enter-
tain viewsaomewhatsimilar to his own, he would say nomoie
upon this point, but meiely read the section he had referred to.
This proviso simply declares, in the fewest possible words,
that no stock shall be sold below par, while this section of the
amended act declares that the Secretary shall  sell the stock
here ifter to be issued at the highest possible price that can ba
obtained for it, after havmg advertised for a reasonable time*
Now he had supposed that no such negotiations as the honorable
chairman of the Committee seemed to anticipate, either per>
sonal, or by agents, could be entered into for the sale of the
stock   below par     The terms of the   advertisement   le
had supposed must measure, in every íespecu the lerna
of  the    pi oposuions    made   by   lenders,   and    that   tl a
proposals must  be made   in    pursuance  of  such adver
tisement,  and m strict conformity to a     How could the
utock he sent abroad for sale unless the agent for  its sale  ha
guided by some specific valuation of that stock?   But,he would
dtsmi'is this subject, and íefer for a moment to the thira section,
of the original dct, which authonzea the Secretary of the 1 rea-
eury to receive written proposals for the purchase of atock, or to 
employ an a°ent to dispose of the same, and to receive a com-
pensation for effecting such sales, not to exceed one per cent,
ur on the amount of the stock disposed of   This provision we 
not m any way altered, unless it were by construction of tí e
clause which he had just read    The fifth and last section of tie*
ongmal act, pledges ihe faith of the United States for the pay-
ment of the interest and the redemption of the principal ofth&
loan authoi ized to be made under it    Ihe fifth section of tilo
amended bill pledges the entire revenue arising from the cus-
toms, both for the pavment of the interest and the redemption
of the principal, or at least eo much of it as may be necessary to
leach both tIieoeobjects    He would here refer to a remark of
the honoiable chairman upon this point, and it was hot the nrfct
time he had heaidthe objection, that the offering a specific furd
in pledge foi the fulfilment of our obligations, or for strength-
ening the fai h of Government, was altogether improper,   ard
that such an expectation on the part ©f the capitalist would la
dishonorable, and derogatory to the character of the Govern-
ment    That the men who ¡ropose to lend us money should
a&k us what will you mortgage for its repayment—what wnl
you presentas an assurance that you will pay your obligations 
implies a want of confidence which is highly discreditable
Thia might be so he (Mr Wright) was not a Very nice judge of
the«e considerations of honor, more especially whete they were
commingled with money, hut he woidd venture to tell the bono-
rah e benator that if ho would converse with a Rothschild or a
Baring financiers not of a nation, but of th' world, they might
be called, he won 11 find that they would quite as soon receive
a visible and tangible e\ nlence /or a morey obligation ashonox
or faith, coming from -wnatever source, oi however solemnly
pledged    If the htsfoiy oí the traLsactions of those distinguish-
ed houses had come down to us tiuly, they had learn d lent;
sirice that money would piocure horor and they had been mo'a
fortunate than many men, ll they had not also learned that
honor and laith do notalwa s pay debts    He could not himself
fee) that the Government would be dishoutred   if in connec-
tion   with   its   plight ed  faith,   it   piesented   to   the world
when asking pecunniy credit—a specific fund to meet the pay
ment of the obligation    lie was unable   lie contessed, to feel
thai  cn^itivenes which lull fen manifested by the honorable
churman and other  in resold to the impugning of our own

which he is distinguished «shall foreigneis ask you what will
