This, bear in mind, Mr. Speaker, where the member from New York claims a discrepancy against the board of $530,987 33 in sixteen con-
tracts ; a trifling misrepresentation on his part of $554,646 68.
I- have prepared another table (E) which will give the exact state of the facts as to this alleged misrepresentation to be found in the
column of estimated liabilities of the board. I submit in this connection this table. It shows the. actual cost of work, estimated for
in the column of liabilities of the board, to be over $59,000 less than the board stated it.

It is not quite easy, Mr. Speaker, to hold
the attention of the House to the point which
the gentleman has been endeavoring to make
in this connection, and which I am refuting.
The point is simply this: the gentleman
finds in the report of the board a column in
the list of contracts for work done upon our
improvements which shows the estimated cost
of the work. These estimates, according to
the board, amount to $6,387,933 15. The
gentleman has assumed throughout his whole
speech that this figure should be multiplied by
two, and it would not even then show the true
liabilities of the board. I am demonstrating
mathematically that the gentleman is wholly
