HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-11.20 a.m.

Colonel MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Second Corps:

COLONEL: The general directs me to say that it is not his desire to advance his line of battle at present beyond the enemy's intrenchments, unless it is to cut off the intrenchments on a favorable line near the rifle-pits, so as to make our line parallel to theirs, if possible. We will then be better enabled to maneuver out of the enemy's sight, holding them with a strong line of skirmisher. If Barlow's and Birney's divisions are strong enough to hold the front line, you can leave Gibbon's division in reserve, so that one division can be in hand to maneuver. Fix it so that one division will be in reserve.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. G. MITCHELL,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 13, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac, Va.:

GENERAL: General Gibbon has pushed forward his division in front of the line occupied by the enemy yesterday. The enemy appear to occupy a line of rifle-pits which either existed before or have been constructed since a secondary line. Their troops are seen moving both to the right and left in General Gibbon's front. The following sketch will show the position:

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
