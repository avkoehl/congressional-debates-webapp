THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 6,
Mr W said his residence was in the county of
St Lawrence, the extreme north wes*ern county of
the State His lecollection was, that settlements
were commei ced in that county at about the year
1800, and that the county was organized between
that time and 1804 It was not now a large
county in popula ion, relatively speaking, and
during the wai of the Revolution, he did not sup
pose tiisie was an armed white man in it Still it
now presented a somewhat numerous list of revo-
lutionary pensioners He had been informed that
at the ñist Couit of Recoid held m the county,
after the passage of the act of 1832, about seventy
of the venerable survivors of thatglonous struggle
assembled in that new county to make then appli-
cations for the.pensions granted by it He did
not know the fact, but he presumed that of the
number assembled there would not have been
found five who claimed to have served eithei in
the New York line, or the New York militia
The county is almost exclusively settled from the
States of Massachusetts and Vermont, and the
pensioners now residing within it, are nearly all
emigrants from those and other States Inasmuch
as this county had no white population dunngthe
war, if the premises of the gentleman be sound, it
should have no pensioners now, and his leason-
mg is, that the fact that it has raises the presump-
tion that the applications have been sustained by
fraud
Mr W said he knew the honoiable Senator
would not contend that this was true as to all
these cases, but he seemed to think it must be as
to a large poition of them If the gentleman was
as well acquainted as himself with the population,
and the progress of settlement of the western por
ttons of New York, he would change his opinions
Where, he would ask the honorable Senatoi, was
now the population of New York > Of its 2,000,
000 of inhabitants, he felt confident he should be
within the fact, when he said that at least 1,000,-
000 was to be found in poitions of the terntoiy of
the State wheie there was no white population at
the close of the revolutionary war The county
of Oneida, the most populous county of the State,
the city and county of New Yoik alone excepted,
was a wilderness, inhabited by the savages exclu-
sively, until long after the conclusion of that war
He believed it was true that theie might have been
a block house or two, or some slight works eiect
ed foi defence against the Indians, within its ter-
ritory duung or before the termination of the wai,
but the county was unsettled and uninhabited by
the whites until after that period N >w, he be
lieved, if a line weie drawn across the State as fai
east as the east bounds of this county, neaily, if
not quite, the one half of the white population of
the ¡Mate would be found west of such line The
most of this population, too, would be found to
consist of emigrants fiom othei States since the
Revolution, and they had [nought with them a full
share, he thought he could say a latge share, of
the soldierb of the Revolution Was ltunnatuial
that it should be so> Who so hkely to emigrate
from the thickly settled portions of the old States
to the great West, to the unexplored wilderness, as
the soldiers of that war> They undoubtedly came
out of that war, as mo3tof them went into it, poor,
and unable to purchase the cultivated and valuable
land of the old States
Mr W said it was not the rich, but the pool
men of a countt y, in any war, who constituted its
soldieiyand filled the ranks of us armies, and it
was not the rich, but the pool men of a country
who constituted the pioneers of its wilderness,
and fust swept away its forests and cu'tivated its
soil This would always be the woik of those
whose pecuniary circumstances compel them to
earn then living by the labor of their own hands,
and who can only acqmie home whe^e land is
cheap and can oe made valuable by their own im-
provements Such weie thesoldieis of the Revo-
lution, and vast numbers of them left their resi-
dences m the settlements, and pushed their way
into western New Yoik
Mr W said he would remind the honorable
Senator that the counties of Westchester and Sar-
atoga, perhaps more emphatically than any other
portions of New York, except the city, were the
seat of war, and still he could not be mistaken in
supposing that Oneida, and many other of the
comparatively new counties, wojld be found to be
the places of residence of a greater number of
revoiutionai y pensioners than eitner of the coun-
ties he had first named The reason was obvious
Trien popu ations were much gieatei,and weie
composed as much of those who lived and acted
in the scenes oí that war, as the peoole of those
counties Indeed, many, who seived in the aimy
as ciuzens of those counties, vt ei e now to be found
at the West, as emigrants fiom the old to the new
paits of the State Apioper consideiaaon of these
facts, he was sure, would convince the honoiable
Senator that his mode of reasoning was unjust
and must Uad him to erroneous and unjust conclu-
sions The supposition that the population of the
States had maintained their pioporuons from the
time of the Revolution to the present day, was
inadmissible, as contradicting known facts, and to
suppose that the soldiers of that seven years' war
had íemained more stationaiy than any othei
equal poition of the population of the States was
equally against probability and fact
Mr W said he was glad that the amendment
offered by the honorable Senator fiom New Ter-
sey, duecting the call to embiace the line oi corps
in which each pensionerserved, had been adopted,
because that would show wheie these veterans of
each State now reside He was perfectly willing
that any pioper sciutiny, as to the pensioners le-
sidi ig within his State, should be had, and he had
no fear that the call, as now made, would show a
greatei numbei of those pensioners fiom the New
Yoik line, or the New York militn,tlian the pio-
porlion wnich the numbeis of those corps, actually
in seivice, would be found to bear to the whole
army.
Mr W said he felt sure the honorable Sena'or
had not selected New York, so peculiarly, foi the
puipose of his comparisons, fiom any invidious
motive     He had expressly disavowed any such
intention, andjie (Mi  W ) should not have been
able to convinceliimself of the existence of such a
mouve, if the disavowal had not been made     But
he must say, it did appear to him, if it had been
the sole object of the Senator, reasoning from the
premises he had chosen to assume, to have shown
toe palpable disparity between the troops in ser-
vice fiom each State, and tne numoer of pension-
ers, now residing within it, that he might have ob-
tained much stiongei instances than that between
South Carolina and New Yoik, by turning his
attention to the new States of the West     He had
told the Senate that the troops furnished by New
Yoik and South Caiolina weie nearly equal, and
that the pensionéis residing in New Yoik at the
piesent time were eighteen times as manyas those
lesiding in South Caiolina    If the honoiable Sen-
ator had taken Omo, how would his companson
have resulted ' Mi  W  said he had noWopked at
the report to whii-h the gentlemin had referred, but
he piesumed that Ohio now leturied a number of
pensionéis, equal to that of South Caiolina   [Here
Mi PitrsroNiemarked/oi  ¡imesasmany ]  Then i
(said Mr W ) Ohio has within it four times as I
many i evolutional y pensionéis as South Caiolina, f
and Ohio did not furnish a soldier lor the service— i
Ohio did not contain a white man, till years after
the wai     South Carolina, therefore, furnished just
as many more men foi  the service than Ohio, as
the whole numbei of men she sent into that great
struggle, and still Ohio piesentsfoui times as many ,
pensioners from that seivice, as are presented by
South Carolina     Heie (Mr W said) the gentle-
man had a companson, not counting in tens, but m |
thousands, and he would not attempt to establish I
the late pel cent   advantage to Ohio, but would
leave it with the other cale ulations of the Senator
He must, however, be permitted to suppose that !
the honorable gentleman would see, fiom this in   I
stance, the palpable injustice of his comnarisons,
and the erroneous nnpiessions they would be like-
ly to create     According to his positions, Ohio, In- I
diana,Illinois, Missoun.and thenewStates at the l|
southwest, ought not to piesent a pensionei, as
they weie not inhabited at the time of the war, and ||
therefore pi esented no troops for the service    Still  I
it was admitted thatthey all did present pensioners,  I
and surely the gen'leman would not contend that
the single fact of their not having sent tioops into
the revolutionary army was proof that all tne pen- i
sior applications from those States were false and <¡
fraudulent     On the contiary, the erior was, that  I
the honoiable Senator had not made allowance for
the great changes of location of the inhabitants of
the old States, and reflection would satisfy him
that the giounds he had assumed, and the conclu
sions he had diawn, fiom  erroneous piemises,
weie manifestly unju&t to some of the States
Mr PRESTON íephed at length to Mr Wpight
and others, commenting extensively upon the
whole pension system, and, in the course of his
iemaik«, compaied the number of pensioners in
New Yoik with those in Ohio, and compaied also
the population of the two States, to show that the
population of the latter was half that of the foi mei,
while the number of persons receiving pensions,
lesiding within the lattei, was but about one fifth
of the numbei appealing to íeside within ihe for-
mer HenC3 he mferiedthatMr Wright's mode
of accounting for the great number of pensioners
residing in New York, by the emigiation to that
State fiom o^her States, was not supported by
facts
Mr WRIGHT rejoined He said he should
not be led by the gentleman into a discussion of
the pension system that the lesolution before the
Senate was a call foi information, and he had no
disposition to discuss the questions which might
arise, when infoimation should be obtained, in
anticipation, oi upon a supposed state of facts.
He should be leady to meet those questions when
the facts were settled, but he must dec' ne wholly
attempting to settle them upon hypotheses, and
especially in considering a call for the facts His
object, theiefore, in rising, at this time, was sim-
ply to answer the remiiksof the Senator as to the
disparity in the number of pensioners between
Ohio and New York, and, this done, he would
detain the Senate no longer The answer seemed
plain to his mind, and, upon its being suggested,
he tnoughtit would be equally plain to the Senate
The revolutionaiy soldiers were the early emi-
grants fiom the old States They weie not modern
etmgiants, as then ages must necessauly satisfy
every gen Jeman Western New York was opened
to them immediately aftei the peace of 1783, and
they soon began to form settlements theie The
teintoiy now composing the State of Ohio was
then beyond tlu reach of settlement, and it waa
many years after, and when western New York
had become measurably full, that the emigiation
flowed over it into Ohio Before that peuod had
arrived, most of these old soldiers had fixed them-
selves down in permanent abodes nearer to the
settlements of the old Stites Hence, when the
tide set most strongly to Ohio, there would have
been anion  the emigrants a much less proportion-
ate numbei of re/olutionary soldiers
Even now (Mr W said) their descendants
from western New York were beginning to move
on, not into, but beyond, Ohio, into the States of
Indiana, Illinois,and Missouri, but few, veiy few,
of these aged patriots would be found among the
emigrants They remained at the homes they had
established in their younger days The weightof
years had become too heavy upon them to ren-
der tnem willing again to seek the wilderness,and
again to encounter the hardships of a new coun-
tiy This seemed to him a sufficient ieason for
the diminution in the numbei of pensioners as the
emigiatisn was followed west
The discussion was further continued by Messrs
SPRAGTJE, EWING CHAMBERS, PRES-
TON, FORSYTH, and CALHOUN.
The vacancies on the Committee of
Commerce, occasioned by the election of
Mr Foot Governor of Connecticut and
Mr. Laurence, Mayor of New Yoik,
have been filled by the appointment of
Mi. Gillet and Mi. Lincoln.
The Hon. M T Hawkins, who has
been absent some eight or ten days at
Philadelphia, to consult Dr. PhyMCk, re-
sumed his seat jesteiday, and we aie
gratified to leain that his health is much
improved.
