EVENING SESSION.
At half past seven o'clock p. m. the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
resumed its session, (Mr. Wheeler in the
chair,) and proceeded with the consideration
of the bill (H. R. No. 1068) to amend existing
. laws relating to the duty on imports, and for
other purposes.
The Clerk read the next paragraph of the
bill, as follows:
On gunny oloth, gunny bags, cotton bagging, or
other manufactures, composed wholly or in part of
hemp, jute, flax, tow, or other material, and suitable
lor the uses to which cotton bagging is applied, val-
ued at 10 cents or less per square yard, S cents per
pound; valued at over 10 cents per square yard, 4
ccnts per pound.
Mr. BUCKLEY. I move to amend that
paragraph by striking out "3" in line two
hundred and ninety-five, and inserting "2,"
and by striking out " 4 " in line two hundred
and ninefy-six, and inserting "3;" so that it
will read:
On gunny cloth, gunny bags, cotton bagging, or
oilier manufactures composed wholly or in part of
hemp, jute, flax, tow, or other material, and suitable
for the uses to which cotton bagging is applied, val-
ued at 10 cents or less per square yard, 2 cents per
pound; valued at over 10 ccnts per squaro yard, 3
cents per pound.
Mr. Chairman, the articles mentioned in
this section are largely consumed in the cot-
ton-growing States of the South. In the one
article of cotton bagging alone is wrapped
up and sent abroad 54 per cent, of our annual
exports. During the present cotton year we
shall export $200,000,000 worth of raw cot-
ton, far more than one half of which is cov-
ered with India bagging. And' until we
abandon our ruinous practice of exporting
raw cotton and- substitute therefor bales of
cotton yarn, and thereby increase our ex-
change 100 per cent., we must continue to use
large quantities of foreign bagging. It is for
this reason I desire to call the attention of
the committee to the enormously high duty on
gunny cloth, and I think I can show that the
revenue will not be decreased or domestic
manufactures impaired by accepting the amend-
ment I have proposed:

1807-68 20,086

Consumption of domestic cloth for crop of
corresponding year is as follows:

1807-68  9,700
1868-6 9 11,723
1869-7 0 16,005
The total amount of foreign and domestic
bagging used for crop of 1869-70 is 45,012 bales
cloth, which covers 2,520,720 bales cotton.
But the crop of 1869-70 is now estimated at
3,000,000 bales, so the amount of bagging will
be considerably increased over and above the
amount I have estimated.
It is now estimated that preparations are made
to grow 15 per cent, more eotton this year
than last. 1 he cotton crop of 1870-71 will re-
quire 51,703 bales cloth. Nineteen thousand
and five bales of this will be made at home,
allowing an increase in home manufacture of
3,000 bales over last year. This has been the
average yearly increase for the last four'years.
The crop of the present year, then, will re-
quire an importation of India cloth of 32,758
bales, or 11,792,880 yards. This cloth will
average in weight 2} pounds per yard, giving
us 25,069,870 pounds. This, at the present
oppressive duty of 3 cents per pound, will give
us a revenue of $752,096 10 from gunny cloth
alone, $21,395 90 more than was collected in
1809 from gunny cloth and gunny bags, and all
other manufactures wholly or in part of hemp,
jute, or like material.
A duty of 2 cents per pound, as I propose, will
vield a revenue from gunny cloth alone of
$501,397 40, only $229,302 80 less tljam wa§
collected in 1869 from gunny cloth, gunny bags,
and all other manufactures of like material.
I ask the attention of the committee to the
following statements:

Cloth for 2,520,720 bales cotton has been taken to
January 1,1870. The estimate of 3,000 bales for the
balaneo of crop will probably not vury materially,
as the oloth taken from January to June. 1808, was
3,231 bales, and from January to June, 1869, 2,958
bales. There was no increased manufacture of cloth
in the West in 1869 over 1868 until after J uly, since
when several new factories havo been started, which
will add to the production of domestic cloth for tho
crop of 1870 and 1871.

of cotton prove as large as present crop, say 2,700,000

bales of cloth of this oxtra amount will probably be
required up to January 1, 1871. It is estimated that
preparations are made for growing 15 per cent, more
cotton this year than last. There was no itoek of/lo-
mestic cloth on hand January 1,1870, but it has sineo
commenced to accumulate. The domestic factories
must increase their weekly outturn of 1869 00 per
cent, in order to mako the amount of cloth above
estimatod as their probable production in 1870.

yards, to bo provided for by importation, or by in-
creased American manufacture, a quantity in itsolt
greater by 2,158,125yards, or 5,995 bales, than the total
domestio manufacture of 1869.
Tho domestic manufacture in 1808 was 4,2-0,230
yards, and in 1809, 5,701,875 yards, an increase of only _
1,541,595 yards. It is not therefore probablo that the
domestio manufacture will bo increased to 13,681,875
yards, which it, must be to require no importation ot
India cloth for tho coming crop, nor is a sufficient
homo production likely to be reached for several
years.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. SCHBNClf. The discussion in regard
to gunny cloth may be said to have already
taken place this afternoon in connection with
the discussion upon the subject of jute butts;
and I have therefore very little to saying regard
to it.
This is a tariff for both protection and rev-
enue. This article of gunny bags and gunny
oloth brings us in revenue of nearly $1,000,000.
The paragraph now presented by the Commit-
tee of Ways and Means proposes precisely tho
same as the present rates, that is, 3 cents per
pound upon all of this article valued at 10
cents or less per square yard, and 4 cents per
pound upon all valued at over 10 cents per square
yard, making two classes of goods. The com-
mittee have not proposed to raise it; they have
not thought it would be right to lower it.
Now, sir, what is the protection that it
affords, looking at it in that light? Having
already spoken of the revenue that it produced,
it would seem as if there was a very wide
range. There is only about 31 per cent, of
protection upon the last class, those articles
that are valued above 10 cents per square yard.
Very little of this article, however, is used for
the purpose of baling in this country. It would
seem as if this was perhaps a very high rate
of duty on some of the articles, about 80 per
cent., according to the invoice rates in gold;
but the fact is that in Scotland,where the arti-
cle is prepared in the first place, it costs some
5 or 6 cents to prepare it, so that the average
protection is about 35 per cent, on that which
is actually used in this country.
Now, 1 suppose these gentlemen will regard
35 per cent, as entirely too much, because it is
a western interest that is involved, because
this article comes in competition with bagging,
which we make in the large bagging factories
in various portions of the West. Gentlemen
from New England ncvSr think that from 35
to 80 per cent, protection is too much for any-
thing which they produce; not at all. But
when you come to an interest connected with
a growing manufacture in the western coun-
try they hold that it is all wrong, that it is
unfair to give it any protection of tho kind.
Why, God bless your soul! the western men
hava never thought of aBking for more than 8
or 9 or 10 per cent., and our flax interest has
stood at 4} percent, for many years past._ l>iit
we have succeeded in having the duty raised a
little, so that our flax-producers can get along
a little better under the influence ot the pro-
tection extended to them.
The present tariff gives this percentage upon
these articles, and the committee have recom-
mended that in this respect the present taril.
