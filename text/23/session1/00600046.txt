THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dec. 20,
notice was given does not enable theUmted States
to insist on reimbursing it, so as to stop the inter-
est, before the 1st of May, 1834 A small portion
ofitwas,however,purchasedfoi theUmtedS'ates,
in the months of brptembei and Oaobei, by an
agent employed for that purpose—<md on the same
day that notice was given of the intended íeim-
bursement on the 1st of Miy next, an offer was
made to the hoideis, by public advertisement, to
pay them the whole amount of the principal, with
interest to the day of payment, upon their making
the proper tiansfers of the cert acates. Many of
the holders have already accepted this offei, and
portions of it continue almost daily to be piesented
foi payment. It is believed that the greater part,
if not the whole, of this stock,will beiedeemed by
the end of the present year. Undei these circum
s .anees it seems proper to charge the whole amount
to the -expenditures of the present year rather
than to the next; the account isaccordmgly stated
on this punciple, and the interest calculated to (he
first of Januaiy, and if a part of it should not
come in by that time it will make no matenal
difference in the result, because the interest saved
upon the stock paid before the end of the year
will, it is expected, be equal, oi nearly so, to ihe
amount of interest which may afterwaijs arcme
on the portion remaining unpaid And if the
whole of it should be reimbursed within the pres-
ent year the interest savtd will mciease the esti-
mated balance in the Treasury in but a very small
degree In the following account, therefore, the
whole of this stock is charged to the expenditure
of 1833, and the interest on it calculated as if it
would be reimbursed on the 1st of January, 1834

The value of the exports of the year ending
on the 30th of September last, is estimated at
$90,663,403, of which $70 042,030 were of do-
mestic, and $20,021,373 ot foreign articles, show-
ing an increase in the exports of domestic produce
of $7,504,560 over the exports of the same char-
acter for the year ending 30th September, 1832,
and a diminution in foreign arucles of $4,018,100
The value of the impoits foi the year ending on the
30.h of Septembei last is estimated at $109,000,000,
being greater by the sum of $8,000,000 than the
imports for the year ending 30th September, 1832
Of the imports for the vear ending 30 h Septem-
ber last, it is estimated that $34,000,000 weie in
articles free from duty
It will be seen from the foiegoing statement o<"
the receipts of the piesent year, that they very
much exceed the amount at which they were esti-
mated in the last annual report
The excess has been derived chiefly fiom cus-
toms, which aie estimated to pioduce moie than
$28 000,000
lhe laige leceipts of this year have been prin-
cipally occasioned  by the act of July 14, 1832,
which abolished ihe system of long ciedits on lev-
enue  bonds, and required the duties on woolen
goods to be paid in cash, and on other aiticl s in
three and six months     Tne new íegulation took
effect on the 4th of Maich last,and thecosh duties ,
and shoi tened ei edits have brought into theTreas-
ury during the present } ear a  large amount of
revenue which, underthe former sj stem of credits,
would not have been payable until 1834, and would |
have foimed a pirt of the receipts of that yeai
The income of 1833 has, theiefore, had theadvant-
age of the new system, as well as of the former i
one, and the receipts are much greater then they
would have been under either of them, according (
to the established rate of duties
The expenditures for the piesent year have
also bpen unusually üige, and are estimated at
$22,086 063 61, exclusive of the expendituie on
account of the public debt.
The appropi lations for the year were heavy, ar d
exceeded by thiee millions the appropriations for
1832, and the balances of unexpended appiopria-
tions at the close of that yeai have been fui the
most pait applied during the present one to the
various objects authouzed by law, and therefore
enter into tne accuunt of its expenditui es Several
items of appropriation, however, foi the present
year cannot be considered as forming a part of the
óidmary expenditures of the Government With-
out enumeirting all otjects of this description, it
mav be sufficient to mention some which have
contnbuted maiemlly to enhance the amount ac-
tuallyexpended The duties refunded at theTieas-
uiy under the law of the last session, and the
awaids under the convention with Denmaik, aie
included in this account, and the expenses occa-
sioned by the Indian aegressions in 1832 have been
foi the most part paid in this year These three
items amount to nearly two millions of dollars
Cut when this sum is deducted fiom the whole an-
nual expenditure it shows that more than twenty
millions of dollars haye been expended during the
piesent year for the vanous other objects author-
ized by law, ex<lu<-ive ot the amount set apaitfor
the leimbursemen' of the 4,¡ per cent stock The
pensions foi life granted under the acts of 1818
and 1832 to t><e officers and soldiers of the Revolu-
tion have increased considerably the annual ex-
penditui e Moi e than four millions of dollars have
been alieady paid on that accountduring the pres-
ent yeai There is, indeed, no item in the list of
appropriations which our citizens generally more
cheerfully contribute to pay than the one last men-
tioned, but ni the older of nature it must be annu-
ally dec easing, and m the estimates of the coming
year, those payable undei the act of June, 1832,
are set down at three millions of dolíais. The
different sums above mentioned, therefore, show
six millions of dollars paid for purposes which
cannot be considered as entering into the ordinary
and regular expenses of the Government, and form
no rule by which its future annual expendituie
ought to be estimated
The receipts of 1834 must be very much below
those of the present year    A large portion of the
receipts from customs, as already stated, has been
derived from the importations of pievious years.
But from the change in the system of credits,
only a small part ot the duties accrums in this
1 year will go into the receipts of the next     And
the diminished rate of duties, which takes effect
|on the first of Januai y next, on some of the most
i pioductive anieles, and the entire exemption of
| others, will contribute still more to reduce the re-
ceipts of the coming year, as compared with the
1 piesent
In est mating the receipts from customs for the
year 1834 at fifteen millions of dollars, I have
assumed that the imports of that year will nearly
equal those of 1832 This estimate is higher than
the average of the last five or six years, but it is
believed to be a safe one. For although the im-
portations of each of the two last years were
unusually large, yet the imports of the present
one have gone still higher And the general state
of our commerce, and the situation of the country,
justify the belief that there will be no serious
diminution m the coming year The condition of
the mercantile classes does not indicate any ex-
cess of importation Indeed, the short ciedits
and csh duties will be found to contribute gieatly
to prevent overtrading in thatrespect Moreovei,
many aiticles in common use aie admitted free
from duty This will produce an increased cbility
in the community to buy those which pay duty,
and consequently a greater consumption There
appears, therefore, to be no reason to appifhend
any seiious diminution in the impoi taiions of 1834,
and it will be sate to estimate its leceipts by the
standard above mentioned Yet anv material
excess beyond that estimate cannot, I thiik, be
counted on The produce of the public lands can
hardly fall short of the sum at which it has been
stnted, and will perhaps exceed n
In this view of the iceipts of 1834 the income
of the year will about equal the estimated expend-
ituie    And with the aid of the balance in the
