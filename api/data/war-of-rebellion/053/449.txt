from it, and only a contingent one to withdraw them temporarily for the purpose of not losing the position permanently. I am in great hope of not finding it necessary to withdraw them at all, particularly if you raise new troops rapidly for us there.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 17, 1863.

Captain SEMPLE,

Louisville:

Troops at Glasgow are on the alert. It is of the greatest importance to have a force at Columbia. Colonel Weatherford should be sent there immediately. Let me know when he will be in readiness to assist in driving rebels from the borders.

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 17, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I ordered Colonel Strickland, this morning, to send detachment to Columbia. I have ordered him to-night to send Colonel Spaulding with 200 men, from Glasgow, to that point and pursue the enemy. I still insist that Colonel Weatherford be moved to Columbia.

What has become of the Seventh Indiana Cavalry you were to send here? Need it to escort trains to Knoxville and Nashville.

Dispatch just received from Captain Semple says that 50 rebels were in Columbia this morning, plundering the town; left about 8 o'clock in direction of Glasgow, under Captain Bilberg. Said that Hughs would be there this evening. Send expedition in direction of Columbia, also toward Tompkinsville, and watch their movement. Keep me advised.
