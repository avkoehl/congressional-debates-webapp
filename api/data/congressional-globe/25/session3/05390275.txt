do not desire to keep them out of the reach of our
oalcul uions If they must come, let them come,
I ut 1 desne to iveit them; and, as the best means
of doing bo, 1 desire to pa's Iks bill, or some other
equally strong—equally prompt Let our Gov-
ernment say to Gieat Butam "this is ouraflan,
and not the affair of Maine alone, we will take it
in hand, we will settle it," and, m myjudgment,
the \v hole controversy ceases I urged this argu-
ment last ytai If anybody does me the honor
to rimembcr or to lefer to what I then said, he
will perceive the great stress I then laid upon a
movement, some movement, of the General Gov
einment upon the question of boundaiy I then
urged, with what zeal I could, that the peace of
the country depended upon decided, efficient ef-
fort on the part of the General Government I
say so now-, and every day confirms the truth of
the argument So much, sir, I have felt it neces-
sary to say in pi oof of the pacific character of the
bill now under consideration Nothing can be
clearei to my mind than that peace will be sub-
set ved by it
Cut, sir, the gentleman says that we are not
only to be right, but that we should always have
it in our power to show to the country, and to
the woild, that we aie right, so that, in the event
of future hostilities, the responsibility shall not
a tach to us of disturbing the peace of the nations
Ceitainly, I admit that He then proceeds to
¿how, fiom the correspondence between the two
Governments, pending the negotiation, that there
is, to say the least of it, a veiy pliusible pretext
foi the claim advanced by Gieat Butain, of ex-
clusive juusdiction over the disputed terntoiy
He lies done me the honor to lead very laigely
fiom a speech mide by myself, last session, in
support of the same idea, and I fieely admit, sn,
Hiatal the case then stood, there was much, too
much foundation foi the aigument which he now
uiges The documents did show, unfoitunately,
that there had been nota plain, specificagieemont
on our side, but an acquiescence jn the claim of
the British Government—a yielding to then ic-
peated assertions, upon the giound of some pre-
vious informal undeistanding to that effect I
ceitainly then thought that this claim had been
too often and too stiongly assei ted without being
met oy a stern and decisive rebuke from our Gov-
ernment I endeavored to set forth the conse
quencos of yielding tacitly to its avowal, and I
uiged upon the General Government to lepudiate
and to deny it Denial had not then been given
But how stands the case noto? We have the
soltmn assurance of the Piesident, and of Mr
Porsyth, that no such informal arrangement or
agreement has been made. Great Butain has been
distinctly advised of the misconceptions undei
which she labored before We have obtained,
what it was my purpose last year to obtain, an
assuianee that our temtory had not been given
up, by agreement, to the exclusive jurisdiction of
Gieat Butain
Now, sir, I take the word of our own Govern-
ment to be true in this respect. Istandbyit I
hold them to it, now and hereafter, and however,
up to this hour, the documents may have fur-
nished plausible grounds foi belief m the exist-
ence of such an anangementasis suggested, they
furnish it no longei Why, then, can we not vin-
dicate ourselves to the country and to the world,
if we say to Great Britain she shall not, under
pietense of an agieement which we deny to exist,
attempt to possess herself of the entire control
of the teintoiy in dispute' If we are likely to
be put in the wrong at all, it has already been
done The wrong consists in violating a subsist-
ing agreement, and the President has already most
emphatically declared that no such agreement has
subsisted The question is one, if I may so speak,
of veracity between the Governments Our own
asserts most distinctly that it has never enteied
into such arrangements as are set up by Great
Britain as the foundation of Sir John Harvey's
proceedings, and I am content with the assertion
as I receive it I am not for going back to see
how the case stood before this plain disavowal,
and wiiiie a contrary assumption on the other side
was permitted to remain unrebuked The proofs.,
therefore, upon which I relied last year are all
done away with, in the only way they could sat-
isfactorily be met, by the distinct declaration of
Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Eeans.
our own Government The British Minister,
when called upon for evidence of the agreement
which he had alleged to exist, fails to produce it,
j but, on the othei hand, in the memoiandum or
protocol which he has entered into with Mr Por-
j syth, admits that it is a matter upon which the
two Governmentshave not understood each other
I If that be so, and if Great Britain be now dis-
tinctly informed that her claim of exclusive juus-
diction io inadmissible upon the pietense of a for-
I mer agreement to that effect, and she still persists
in enforcing it by arms, upon whose head will
rest the lesponsibthty of disturbing the peace of
the woild ' Suiely, not upon ours   We can yield
1 to no such invasion without dishonor and dis
grace We must repel it, or we shall stand con-
demned, in the face of all nations, of miserable
pusillanimity
But, sir, there is much in the documents re-
ferred to by the gentleman, and which I cited last
year, to fortify the position now taken by our
Government On the of 8th August, 1837, Mr
Stevenson held this language to Lord Pa'merston
upon this very question of exclusive jurisdiction
" T]ie undersigned, moreover, does not presume that,
pending tile negotiation, and whilst efforts me making for
tilt peaceable and final adjustment of these delicate and
exciting questions, her Majesty'sGovcrnmentcirnc¿imnr/ie
j ri"ht ofcxclusiue juusdiction and sovcrci<rnty over the dis
puted tci ritory or the persons residing u ithln its limits     In
such 1 cl urn of power on the part oí Great Britain, or its
provincial authorities the undersigned need not repeat to
I Lord Palmer ton, (what he is already fully apprised of)
I the Goi eminent of the United States canneier consent to
i acquiesce in the existing state of the controversy "
j And again, on the 10th of November of the
same year, language still more decided   He says
|        To repeat the assurances, heretofore given, that such
proceeding can be regarded in no other light than a viola-
tion of the rijils and soverei^ntii of ike United States, anil
entirely ¡rreconciítir tc with that mutual forbearance which
it w is ui d( r&tood would be practiced by both Governments
pending the negotiation
¡ ' I in circuuist mees under winch these recent attempts
to en oice iiiiisdiction have been made, show that, in ibe
j most f ívoi ihle aspect m which they can be regarded, they
uere uliolly mlefcnsible "
|        Bj what authontj, then   the Provincial Government
i of'Vew liiunswick felt itself justified in exercising feuch
' acls ofsoveieign power the undersigned is at iloss to con
I ceivc, unless indeed, upon the giomid that the junsdic
I tion and sovereignty over the disputed territory, pending
the  controversy, rests errlusiiely nntk Great Britain     If
such should turn out to be the fact, it ran hardly be nrces
sary a^nn to repe it the assurances which havt ber n here
, tofore uveii, that, in any such claim ol power, the Govern
ment of'the United Slates cannot acquiesce
1     " Upon the consequences which would unavoidably re
suit fnnii attempting to evercise  such jurisdiction,   it is
i needli ss to enlarge    ft must now be apparent that all such
attempts, ifpersei ered tn, can produce only leuds and col
I Iisions oí the most pamlul character '
" ft id inder this view of the suiiiect that the under
signed has hi en instructed again to remonstrate against
thes proceedings of the luthonties of New Brunswick, as
a violation of the rights of Mamcm Ike person of her agent.,
and to protest in the most solemn manner against the future
catrcue ot all such acta of jurisdiction and sovereignty over
the di puted territory, or the citizms of the Tjnited States
residing within us limits until a final adjustment of the
controversy takes place "
" it c innot be expected, if the authorities of New Bruns
wick still persevere m attempting to exercise juusiliction
over the disputed territory  by the arrect and imprisonment
in foreign nils of citizens of Maine for performing tkeir
duty under the lans of their own State and within what is
believed to be hi r territorial limits, that measures of retal
j íation will not be resorted to by Maine, and great misfiuef
ensue
" Indeed, under existing circumstances, and in the na
, ture of human connections, it is not possible, should such a
1 courscoj violence be conllnuel, to avoid collisions of the
I most painful chaiacter for which the Government of the
I United States cannot be responsible, but which both Gov
' ernments would equally deplore "
Now, sir, who does not perceive that, if any
agreement for exclusive jurisdiction m Great Bnt-
Í ain subsisted, the time to pioduce evidence of that
agreement, and to have asserted her light undei
it, was in reply to this decided, strong, sigmri
cant language of Mr Stevenson? It was not
done No exception was taken to it If any
informalarrangementorunderstanding has grown
up by silent acquiescence on oui pait to strong
assertions made by British Ministers fiom time
to time, it is, m myjudgment, a sufficient answer
that their assent to these distinct admonitions of
the American Embassador utterly repudiates the
whole arrangement, whatever it was By those
declaiations of Mr Stevenson to Great Butain,
we are solemnly pledged and committed as a na-
tion, in the face of all mankind, to repel this
Ho. of Reps.
claim of exclusive jurisdiction, if attempted to be
executed, even at the  hazard of the highest hu
man responsibilities     Sir, I could go back still
further, and show that similar and equally strong
admonitions had been given to Great Britain on
' several occasions   They have been often warned
if they attempted to maintain entne sovereignty
over the whole territory, it would be resisted.
They are now about, by military force, to at-
tempt it, and how can this nation honorably re-
fuse to maintain the position it has so often taken'
A word or two more, sir, as to the piecise char-
acter of this informal arrangement, with a view
to show how, step by step, it has been the occa-
sion of renewed aggressions under the influence
i of its ever-changing form    At first it was noth-
ing more than that neither party should exercise
' acts of sovereignty, or maintain exclusive juris-
diction in the disputed territory, of course ex-
tending to ant/ pan or every part of it, but that
each should practice forbearance or moderation,
not seeking to obtain possession, nor to strengthen
' its claim by occupation     This Mame thought
j hard enough upon her, but as it seemed to be
I equal  in  its  operation, she  finally acquiesced.
| Next, Great Britain claimed the arrangement to
l be, that neither party should seek to extend its
juiisdictwn, nor exeicise it where it had not been
enjoyed befoie, that each should remain in the
exeicise of authority where it had been previ-
ously exercised    This Maine regaided still more
objectionable, as it required of her to admit the
juusdiction of Great Britain in some portions of
the tei i ltory to which she was convinced her own
title unquestionably extended, but she was com-
pelled to yield to this also, under the arrange-
ments of the General Government, it being clearly
implied that, in some other portions, Maine had
hitherto exercised jurisdiction,and should be con-
tinued unmolested in the enjoyment of it.   This
was, indeed, distinctly asserted     As long ago as
| 1829, Mi   Van Buren, then Secretary of State,
in a note to the British Minister, said
" More than twenty years ago, large tracts of land Ivmg
westwird of Mar  Hill, and noithward on the river Res-
took, were granted b> the State of Massachusetts, which
tracts are held and possessed under those grants to this
day, and the United States and the States of Massachu-
setts and Maine, m succession, have never ceased to exer-
cise that jurisdiction which the unsettled condition of the
country in that region, and other circumstances, admitted
and requited "
But the next advance of the British Govern-
ment was a more sweeping one than all which
preceded it, being no less than a claim to entire
and exclusive jurisdiction over the whole territory
! —eveiy pai t and parcel of it, the Massachusetts
I grants and all—upon the extraordinary argument
that, having been in possession of the whole prior
i to the acknowledgment of our independence, and
1 never having mai ked off what she granted by the
treaty of 1783, she retained the possession and
soveieignty, actually or constructively, to this
day If we yield to this assumption upon this
aigument, and also acknowledge ourselves bound
by the agreement that neither party shall seek to
' extend its juusdiction, what part of the territory,
I desire to know, will be left to Maine'    What
I has become of those ancient grants where, as the
President said in 1829, she had never ceased to
exert her authority' Does not everybody per-
ceive that, if this new stretch of authority on
the part of Sn John Harvey be acquiesced in,
not a foot of the territory will remain in our pos-
session ' The whole is surrendered I say, sir,
a new slietch of authority Piactically it is so I
do not mean that the ciatm is a new one, nor the
argument on which it rests But the attempt
by foice and military power to airest the civil
authorities of Maine where they have hitherto
prevailed, is a new one    Hitherto they have been
j content to ciatm jurisdiction, and to lemonstrate
against its exercise on the part of Maine, but we
j have heeded neither their claims nor their remon-
strances. I speak now of that portion of the dis-
puted territory which is the theater of present
operations, and which is about to become the
seat of wai—the Aroostook region
The giants made by Massachusetts, referred to
by Mr  Van Buien in the extract just read, were
' situated in this very, region, and it was upon one
I   of the identical " tracts" there spoken of that the
II  land agent of Maine has recently been arrested
