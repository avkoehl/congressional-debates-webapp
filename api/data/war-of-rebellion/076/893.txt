Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: General Hood directs me to acknowledge the receipt of your note (hour not given) in which you express the opinion that the extreme left of the enemy's infantry is moving toward Decatur. It is important to get exact information of the state of affairs in that vicinity at night-fall. He therefore requests you to send your best scouts close in, so as to ascertain whether the left of the enemy's infantry crosses Peach Tree Creek, where it rests, and what is its strength, and notify him of the result.
