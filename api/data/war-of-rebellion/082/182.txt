HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 12, 1864-3.30 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I am about to move my headquarters to the Ginn house. My troops are now moving. Is General Ferrero to take any apart of the picket-line, or is it understood that I am to keep it all? If I hear nothing to the contrary I will leave a division to hold the line as indicated in your confidential note of yesterday. The line will, however, be contracted somewhat at daylight.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 12, 1864-4.45 a.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

To prevent any accident I wish to inquire whether my pickets are to be relieved by General Ferrero, as your telegram does not state explicitly, and I do not like to withdraw without a full understanding. When General Ferrero established a picket-line am I to withdraw mine?

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

Major-General HANCOCK:

If you have to leave to-day I would like to have you leave your pickets on your right where they are in contact with the enemy,and if you leave please also communicate direct with General Crawford. I have a good deal of work to do everywhere on our new line, and am working so many men that I could not have so many ready to fight as I would like.
