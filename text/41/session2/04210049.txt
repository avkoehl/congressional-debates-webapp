Mr. SHERMAN. A bill similarto this has,
I think, twice passed the Senate. I will state
the precise facts of the case. Under the law
of 1804 certain assessors were appointed in the
southern States, but could not take the oath
prescribed by law.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Is this bill before the
Senate.
Mr. SHERMAN. Yes, sir.
Mr. SUMNER. It is an old customer, and
I do not think we ought to act upon it now.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I hope it will never pass
again if it has passed twice.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
state, before the debate commences, as this is
the opening of the session, that the eleventh rule
declares that " motions to take up or proco.ed
to the consideration of any question shall bo
determined without debate upon the merits of
the question proposed to be consideredand
the Chair understands it to be the wish of the
Senate that the Chair should hold strictly to
the rules.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Yes, sir.
Mr. POMICROY. I hope that rule will be
enforced. It never has been heretofore.
Mr. SHERMAN. I moved to take up the
bill at the request of a Senator representing
one of the States in which these parties live.
I think it ought to be acted upon, and I know
of no better time than the present. If, how-
ever, the Senate is disinclined to act upon it
now I have no disposition to press it.

Mr. WILSON. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of executive busi-
