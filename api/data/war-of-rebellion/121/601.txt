most extensive hospital gangrene and the fatal pyaemia. Every town and village in Georgia is filled with the wounded and sick, and the privations and sufferings of the Con federate troops, even amongst their own countrymen, are great beyond description and equal those of any armies in ancient or modern times. With the whole energies of this people engaged in such a terrible and unequal struggle, it is not singular that medical aid and talent of the highest order should be comparatively scarce and difficult of access and control at the interior posts.
The very conditions and results of tile contest also, without doubt, tend to excite such prejudices as would disincline medical officers from seeking service amongst their captive enemies.

I found no record of the sick in the stockade previous to September 14, 1864. It appears that previous to this date no record was preserved of the diseases treated within the stockade and the following includes all the medical statistics which I was able to collect within the prison walls proper:

Morning reports of Acting Assistant Surgeon F. J. Wells in charge of Federal sick and wounded

If this table be compared with the following one from the C. S. military prison hospital during the same period we will see that the number of deaths was as great in the stockade as in the hospital, notwithstanding the disparity in the number of medical officers in attendance upon the sick in both instances, being 346 in the former and 344 in the latter.
