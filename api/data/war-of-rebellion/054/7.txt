LOUDON, October 20, 1863.

The artillery officer, when I last saw him, reported to me that [we] had fired our last round. I ordered him to follow me, and if he could not bring in his pieces to abandon them. I do not think the guns will get in. Most of the cannoneers are killed, I think. The artillery officers are here, and will report in a few minutes.

About 50 of the prisoners have just come in; there will be more in soon. I am pretty sure we have from 300 to 400 of them prisoners.

WOLFORD,

Colonel.
