MARCH 7, 1863.

Colonel P. SIDNEY POST,

Commanding, Salem, Tenn.:

COLONEL: You are posted at Salem to observe any movement the enemy may make in your vicinity. General Sheridan has gone to raise the blockade of Franklin, which is being besieged by Van Dorn's cavalry. The main object in sending you to Salem was to watch movements of enemy in coming upon Sheridan's rear, but as he has moved so far to the right his left is in no danger. General Steedman is at Triune and Concord Church, near Nolesville. I wish the Versailles and Shelbyville roads, the latter the old stage road, watched and patroled by squads of say fifty men. I also with you to send parties over toward and to the Shelbyville pike to watch their movements. There order these patrols out under competent and discreet officers, and by secrecy and vigilance I hope to hear of some of the rebel cavalry bushwhacked or captured, if possible. It is not necessary for me, colonel, to caution you to be vigilant, for I take great pride in thinking that none of my corps will be vigilant, for I take great pride in thinking that Coburn's brigade, of Gilbert's command, did at Spring Hill. Keep your command constantly supplied with three days' rations, so that it can be moved with promptness. Communicate here frequently, so that I can always know your condition.

I am, colonel, very respectfully,

A. McD. McCOOK,

Major-General, Commanding.
