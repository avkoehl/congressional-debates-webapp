AT CROSS-ROADS OF BENTON AND DALTON ROAD AND

VARNELL'S STATION AND KING'S LOWER BRIDGE ROAD,

6 MILES SOUTHEAST OF VARNELL'S STATION,

AND 9 1/2 MILES FROM DALTON,

February 23, 1864-1.25 p. m.

SIR: At 11.30 this a. m. I attacked and drove out of their camp at least a regiment of rebel infantry, 3 1/2 miles this side of Dalton. they had winter quarters (log-huts), and as they were completely surprised they had not time to move any plunder out of their huts, and from their appearance and the small amount of plunder in them I believe they were preparing to leave. The cars were whistling furiously while the skirmish was going on. I have not force enough to cope single-handed with all of their cavalry, but I think you may advance with safety if you can still keep your supports, Plamer's troops, &amp;c., within supporting distance. I believe they are leaving the place, and they should not be allowed to do [so] undisturbed. I shall be compelled to go somewhere to get some forage. Please let me hear from you as fully, in detail, as you can. I shall either wait here or move up on the road to Varnell's Station until I hear from you.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELI LONG,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I have 12 prisoners. Can't you send me the Fourth Michigan Cavalry and Second Kentucky and Warner's company, when I may be able to do something?

SIR: I have just arrived here. Will push down the dirt road that runs alongside of the railroad as far toward Dalton as practicable. I believe there are some rebel cavalry on the main Cleveland and Dalton road. I will be compelled to go back to the Connesauga or somewhere else to-morrow unless I have better luck in foraging to-day than I did yesterday. Please to forward a copy of this to General Palmer. A brigade of infantry was encamped where we had the skirmish yesterday. I have met nothing this morning. Let me know your location by the bearer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELI LONG,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

P. S.-I have not received the dispatch sent to me at 2 p. m. yesterday, nor heard of the bearer.
