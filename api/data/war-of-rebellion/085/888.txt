Major H. H. WILLIAM, Pilot Knob:

The four companies named in my last dispatch left Cape Girardeau at 1 o'clock yesterday, and the last company left this morning.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., October 15, 1864.

General EWING:

General McCormick has relieve Colonel McLane from active duty on the ground, as stated, of the regiment having too few men at present to justify placing a colonel on duty. Colonel McLane is the most efficient officer of Enrolled Missouri Militia service in my sub-district; is of more benefit than all the rest of the field officers that have reported. Will you please have him returned to duty and notify me by telegraph.

Brigadier-General EWING:

Four companies of the Missouri State Militia leave here to-day at 1 p. m. for Pilot Knob. I send the howitzers with them. I will send a company to Fredericktown, and as much of a force as I can spare to Bloomfield to-morrow. I have ordered one company from New Madrid. Captain Edwards is doing efficient scouting there now, reports killing two guerrillas Wednesday and wounding the notorious Budge Powell. I think he needs at least two companies of cavalry. I will endeavor to send some more of my regiment to the Knob, as I can replace them with Enrolled Missouri Militia with the exception of Colonel McLane's regiment; the Enrolled Missouri Militia reports slowly.
