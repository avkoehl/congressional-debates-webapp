HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 2, 1863.

Professor LOWE:

Add to former dispatch and notice any movements toward Sedgwick's.

D. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

GENERAL SEDGWICK'S COMMAND,

May 2, 1863 - 6.15 a. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD, &amp;c.:

The troops opposite this place remain in the same position as last evening. Owing to the high wind now prevailing I am unable to use glass sufficiently to see whether there is any movement on the roads between here and the battle-ground of yesterday or not. I will examine them the first opportunity and report.

Respectfully, &c.,

T. S. C. LOWE.

MAY 2, 1863 - 7.30 A. M.

I have just obtained a tolerably good view of all the main roads beyond the heights and toward Chancellorsville, but could see no troops or wagon trains on them. The enemy opposite remain in the same positions, apparently without any increase.

Respectfully, &c.,

T. S. C. LOWE.

MAY 2, 1863 - 7.45 A. M.

General BUTTERFIELD, &c.:

Heavy cannonading has just commenced in a westerly direction about twelve miles. The enemy are shelling our troops opposite here.

T. S. C. LOWE.

MAY 2, 1863 - 8.15 A. M.

Professor LOWE:

Has the enemy's force decreased any?

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

8.30 A. M.

I cannot say that the enemy have decreased, but they do not show themselves quite as much this morning, and I can see no reserves on the opposite heights.

T. S. C. LOWE.

MAY 2, 1863 - 12 M.

Professor LOWE:

Why is not the balloon up, and why do we not hear from it?

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

12.30 P. M.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD, &c.:

GENERAL: I have made several efforts to ascend, but found the wind too high and could not use the glass. It is getting calmer now, and I will try again.

T. S. C. LOWE.

MAY 2, 1863 - 1.05 P. M.

The enemy remain the same opposite this point, and no movement is visible on any of the roads seen from the balloon. The wind continues so flaw that the balloon was blown from a thousand feet elevation to near the earth.

T. S. C. LOWE.
