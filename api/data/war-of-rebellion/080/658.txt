From the time of going into position until the explosion of the mine, the fire of most of these batteries was incessant, and their practice was all that could be desired.

On July 30 the mine on General Burnside's front was sprung at 4.45 a.m., and a heavy cannonade was instantly opened and continued until about 10.30 a.m., when it gradually ceased, the assault of the infantry having failed and the attack being discontinued. The part assigned to the artillery to keep down the fire of the enemy upon the flanks of the column of attack and to keep down the fire of the enemy upon the flanks of the column of attack and to keep back hi re-enforcements was successfully executed. This battle was probably the first in which spherical case from heavy mortars was used. The expedient of putting thirty 12-pounder canister-shot under the bursting charge of the 10-inch shells was of great utility, their steady fire keeping quiet the most dreaded flanking batteries of the enemy's line.
