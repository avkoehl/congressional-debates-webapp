This, for the single month of March, will show
the tendency of our present system to keep us
conatantlyindebt and transfer our manufacturing
establishments to Great Biitain, France, and Ger-
Nmany. In the article of iron, in which the country
at large is so deeply interested as an article of
prime necessity both in peace and war, and which
we could produce in any quantity suflicientto sup-
ply the woild, the policy of the Democratic freo-
tiado party is to permit the oic to remain undis-
turbed. in its native beds :n our own country,
and to import it from England by millions annu-
ally: depriving us thereby not only of the laige
amount of cash which is withdrawn to pay for it
abroad, but 1 he great advantages that would accrue
from us manufacture here to the farmer and la-
borer, as will as to every branch of industry.

From which it will be seen that the amount of
iron imported into the country for ten years and
seven months, under the tariff of 3846, was equal
to 4,207,000 tons, costing $230,561,000; or over
400,000 tons annually, and over $23,000,000
eveiy year, as our other imports, independent
of iron, greatly exceeded all our exports, it may
be fairly claimed that every dollar of this vast sum
had to be paid In gold and silver. What a de-
pressing effect this would have upon the manufac-
ture of iron in this country, and how much benefit
the distribution of this sum, or even one half of
it, would have conferred upon the business of the
country, it is not necessary to state. Every man
of ordinary intelligence must at once see and
acknowledge it. The time has past when it was
alleged, and to some extent believed, that the in-
terest of the manufacturer and farmer was op-
posed to each other. No fact in political economy
can be more surely demonstrated than the entire
harmony of all the great industrial interests of
the country. When the manufacturers are pros-
perous,and labor has constant demand and fair
wages, the farmer finds a ready and profitable
market. So, on the contrary, when manufac-
tures languish, and an undue proportion of the
labor of the country is withdrawn from them, and
either not profitably engaged or not engaged at
all, the farmer fails to find his accustomed home
market, and every department of enterprise and
business languishes.
The true mode of laying a tariff upon all articles
of luxury is as high a duty as they will bear
without excluding their importation. On all those
articles which cannot be produced here, and are
needed by our manufacturers, and on all articles
of necessity, used by the poorer classes as well
as the rich, which are not the production of this
country, there should be no duty whatever. This
is the principle which governs the bill reported by
the Committee of Ways and Means, and must
commend itself, by its justice and propriety, to
all who desire to promote the prosperity of the
country, and the interests of all classes of our citi-
zens, without increasing their burdens.
Specific duties, when the article is of uniform
value, or nearly so, are to be preferred for their
simplicity and their freedom from temptation to
S frauds, even ns a revenue measure. As a protect-
j ivc principle, they are indispensable to that uni-
< formitv and stability so essential to make it of
I real value. As an illustration, take the article of
iron. I have before me the prices current of iron
in Liverpool, for a number of years, under the
tariff of 1846. In 1$50 the average price of bar
iron in Liverpool was £o 10s.,* m 1851 it was
<£10 10s.—within a trifle of one hundred per cent,
difference in one year; in 1852 it was <£5 7s. Qd.;
in 1853, <^9; m 1854, ^J0, &c.; the duty, of course,
varying with the price of the article, increasing as
the price increased, and decreasing as the price
fell. It is manifest that this kind of duty can af-
ford no protection. If the principle was changed,
and the duty increased as the price fell, so as to
keep the value uniform, it would be much nearer
the true mode, and might be legaidedas to some
extent a measure of protection as well as one of
revenue. A departure from specific duties is only
justifiable when the article so varies in price as to
render them unjust or impossible. This bill is
framed upon that principle, and so combines the
two as to make it liable to no objection on that
i account.
I The duty on iron, which is one I have exam-
; ined with some care, does not vary essentially
! from that of 1846. The average duty on railroad
! iron under that tariff was §10 40 per ton; and on j
bar iron, by rolling, $13 96; and on pig iron $4 05. !
So that the present duty is but little over one dol-
lar per ton increase. But this is not a fair state-
ment, so far as the price to the consumer is con-
cerned. It is well known that the duty under that
law is an ad valorem one on the invoice price in
England. When delivered here, if the market does
not justify its immediate sale, it is stored in Gov-
ernment warehouses, without any duty being paid
until the price increases or the wants of the owner
requires him to sell; so that the actual price to the
consumer, under this bill, will probably average
but little, if any, more than under that, while the
revenue to the Government will be increased.
As this bill proposes to abolish the warehouse
system, and makes the duty payable within thirty
days after its arrival here, it may fairly be argued
that, while this bill will afford a fair protection to
the manufacturer, by reason of its permanent and
uniform rate, which can always be relied upon by
him, it will not materially, if at all, increase the
price to the consumer. Shall not a measure, then,
which has so much to approve and nothing to con-
demn; which is fraught with benefits and bless-
ings to all classes of our people; which encourages :
labor, fosters legitimate enterprise, aids develop-
ing our resources, strengthens and invigorates
every branch of industry, adding so much to the
wealth, happiness, and prosperity of our country,
receive the favorable action of Congress to which
it is so justly entitled ? I cannot doubt it. It is
based upon justice and sound policy, and must
triumph.
TIIB POLITICAL C1USIS—TIIE DANGEIl AND THE
REMEDY.
SPEECH OF HON. W. II. ENGLISH,
of indiana,
In the House of Representatives,
May 2, 1860.
The House being in the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union—
Mr. ENGLISH said:
Mr. Chairman: If I were to speak upon the
topics which seem to be absorbing the attention of
everybody just now, it would be upon the scenes
that have been enacted and the events which are
transpiring at Charleston.
I may be permitted to say, sir, upon this sub-
ject of the Presidency, that'1 have but little sympa-
thy with those who imperiously demand "Cajsar
or nobody;55 no sympathy with that rule-or-ruin
spirit which has 6een exhibited too much of late
in both wings of the Democratic party, and to
which may justly be attributed whatever difficul-
ties now exist.
I shall not attempt, sir, on the present occasion,
to characterize this rule-or-ruin spirit in that lan-
guage I conceive it so justly merits; but I venture
to predict that if disaster or serious trouble en-
sues, the masses of the Democratic party never
will forgive, as they never ought to forgive, those
who will have needlessly precipitated this state of
affairs upon the country.
It is not to be denied that, just at this time, dark
and ormnXnis clouds seem to be " lowering over
our house," but I have an abiding faith that these
clouds will soon break away, and leave the glori-
ous sun of Democracy shining brightly ns ever.
Sir, mere political storms have no terror for me,
or for the great party to which I belong; and, for
the present, I stoall go upon the supposition that
whatever storms may have prevailed at Charles-
ton were necessary for the purity and healthful-
ncbsof the politicalatmosphere,as natural storms
are known to be for a like purpose m the physical
world.
At all events, when the time for action arrives,
I doubt not every Democrat will be ready to do
his duty, according to the circumstances which
may surround him. I shall certainly endeavor to do
mine. Even those Democrats who may think our
best man has not been selected for the Presidency
will still have the consolation of knowing that he
is better than the best one the Republicans are >
likely to present us, and that any Dcmociatio
platform is infinitely preferable to theirs. j
Besides, on the great all-important point, there
can be no division in our ranks; and that is, earnest
and unceasing opposition to the principles and
policy of the Republican party. There we stand
os a uinf, and there we must continue to stand,
" one and indivisible, now and forever.55
We may have family differences about other
matters of minor importance, but that is our own
business, and will be regulated and disposed of
in our own way, and, I shall continue to hope, in
a way conducive to harmony and success.
But, Mr. Chairman, my purpose to-day is to
speak more particularly upon the " irrepressible-
conilict" and negro-equality doctrines of the Re-
publican party; and, as I consider the measure
of opposition to these doctrines to be full on this
side of the House, and that on the other sidegen-
tlemen are "joined to their idols," like Ephraim
of old, and to be let alone, what I shall say will ,
be mainly intended for the country—for the hon-
est masses of the American people. This being
the case, I prefer not to have interruptions in-
jected into my speech. I hope not to misrepre-
sent any; but if I should happen to do so, T will
cheerfully give way, before I resume my seat, to
have it corrected.
I know, sir, there is a disposition on the part
of some persons to underrate the importance of
