SMITHVILLE, [December] 24, 1864 - 11.10 a. m.

General WHITING:

Orders that Pelteway stay at Fisher did not reach there in time to stop her. She is here, and when I give her wood and water will take the two companies from Caswell to Fisher. She will lose nothing by it, as tide is now low.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

DECEMBER 24, 1864.

Lieutenant PEMBROKE JONES,

Battery Buchanan:

Don't put self-acting torpedoes on the Rip till further orders. Want to get some obstructions there first.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

FORT FISHER, December 24, 1864 - 7 a. m.

Major HILL:

Fleet still off. Not light enough to define numbers. Wind west and southwest. Not a vestige left of the vessel that blew up.

W. LAMB,

Colonel, Commanding.

FORT FISHER, [December] 24, 1864 - 9.20 a. m.

Major HILL:

Boarding officer reports Little Hattie from Nassau, December 20, and E. F. Daniels pilot. The fleet seems to be getting under way.

LAMB,

Colonel.

FORT FISHER, December 24, 1864 - 10 a. m.

Major HILL:

Fleet are about six to seven miles off. I recognize Ironsides and three frigates of Wabash class in the fleet. Please do not take reserves from me; I need them at night, and they cannot stand marching to and from camp. Can't you send me Ezzell's company? I have to have such a heavy picket that it reduces my effective artillerists.

LAMB,

Colonel.

DECEMBER 24, 1864.

Colonel LAMB,

Fisher:

Keep the battalion of reserves that you had last night. Two companies will come from Caswell in Pelteway. If not disturbed to-night, hope all will go well.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
