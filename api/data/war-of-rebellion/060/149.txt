James River has not reported. Some firing has been heard this morning in t he direction of Bottom's Bridge. I have not heard a word from Major Robertson. Sent him a dispatch a little after light this morning, to know if any enemy menaced his front.

I have just received a dispatch from Major Robertson, who learned from a Mr. Christian that the enemy at Bottom's Bridge are 10,000 strong, and others advancing on another road (the numbers and road not stated). He also inclosed a dispatch from Lieutenant Havenner that the enemy is advancing on the Telegraph and Diascond roads (numbers not stated). The Southside Artillery has arrived; and is in position on the Varina road at fortifications, for the present; six splendid Napoleons. I have directed Major Robertson, in case a retirement before the enemy should be unavoidable, to retire on my infantry pickets at New Market. Colonel Shingler will retire toward Richmond. I hope a back step will not be necessary.

Respectfully, &c.,

EPPA HUNTON,

Brigadier-General.

MAJOR: One of my men (of the Thirty-second Regiment), serving under Lieutenant Hume, has just arrived to give the particulars of the late advance of the enemy. He says he was in 15 yards of the column when it passed. It consisted of one brigade of cavalry, three brigades of infantry, and twelve pieces of artillery. He says that independent of this force there was a large force below, 3 miles below the Burnt Ordinary. He could form no accurate idea of this force, as they were below the scouts; judged it was large from the incessant beating of drums. The cavalry was some distance ahead of the infantry and artillery. He thinks the infantry did not come farther than Barhamsville last night; this is 27 miles from Bottom's Bridge. If he is right in this, the infantry and cavalry had not gotten to Bottom's Bridge before the cavalry fell back. He does not know who commanded the expedition. This scout reports that they killed 3 Yankee sergeants on the upward march. A dispatch just received from Colonel Shinlger says his cavalry pursued the enemy to Crump's Cross-Roads, which is about 5 miles.

Now, if this report of the forces of the enemy is correct (and I have no doubt of it), I am at a loss to understand why the enemy has retired for the small repulse received. Query: Have they abandoned the object of the expedition? I do not yet fell sure of it.
