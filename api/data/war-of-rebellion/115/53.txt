NEW YORK, September 1, 1861.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD, Secretary of State.

SIR: Last night a man who at the time called himself J. Storer, of Dayton, Ohio, but who afterward proved to be Rev. M. M. Hallinan, now of Salem, Mass., but formerly was at the college at Georgetown, D. C., in some capacity, was arrested for endeavoring to induce a soldier in the U. S. service to go over to the enemy, as set forth in the enemy, asset forth in the accompanying affidavits. * He is a young man of about thirty years of age, Irish by birth, and has some reputation as a lecturer. At the time of his arrest he was very such under the influence of drink, and this morning presents the appearance of a man accustomed to such indulgence. On his persons was found $ 1,119. A very large sum to be in the possession of a priest. But on taking possession of his baggage nothing was found to implicate him in any way whatever with the rebels, his papers consisting of skeleton sermons, lectures, poetic effusions and amatory letters. Of the latter there are quite a large number. On his person besides the money besides the money and a few unimportant papers was the inclosed letter* addresed W. L. Beaumont, Boston, Mass. Notwithstanding the strength of the affidavits I send I am inclined to regard him as inoffensive. He is undoubtedly very much debauched by intercourse with women and indulgence in drink. And his visit to Philadelphia seems to have been made in consequence of having received the Beaumont letter, which I have no doubt is another assumed name for himself. In his trunk I found a large number of newsp[aper clips; some are signed M. M. H., others Beaumont, others B. These are no doubt effusions of his own that he has collected. And I think in the erased signature I can trace the word Donna, one of his most devoted correspondents, whose letters and scraps he has sav of over fifty. If I am right, this is a love threat, nothing more; but if not, it may in some way be connected with his conduct with Fabre yesterday. He arrived in this city on Tuesday, 27th instant, and took a room at the hotel in Fourth avenue; left that evening for Philadelphia, where he remained until 2 p. m. of Friday, when he returned on the same train with Fabre, and then went back to the same hotel. The postmark on the Beaumont letter is August 24, and he would seem to have obeyed the summons immediately. The Doctor Fitzgerald whom he involves with himself has command of a company in Colonel F. Webster's regiment, and is now in the field. I think it well that Colonel Webster should be apprised of the suspiction resting on him by the act of this druken priest. If the doctor is sound it will do no harm; if not he had better be on guard. Farbe tells me that the doctor was to join the enemy before he could be expected to get around to them, and this note was for use when he mat him on the other side. I have to request that proper notice be taken of he conduct of the private, Farbe. He has managed the matter in a very adroit manner, and seems to have been influenced alone by a desire to detect and expose the business of seducing our men from their allegiance.

Respectfully, yours,

JOHN A. KENNEDY,

Superintendent.
