General BARTLETT:

The enemy are reported to show infantry in front of our cavalry pickets to the south and southwest of us, either prepared to prevent a movement by us in that direction or, possibly, to make a demonstration against us. i wish you would have everything in readiness throughout the day that can be moved without being observed by the enemy on our front. We may have to re-enforce our left and rear. I propose to make some changes in the disposition of your troops on the front line to-night (if nothing alters my plans during the day) so as to have General Ayres in reserve.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
