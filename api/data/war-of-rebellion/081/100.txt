[First indorsement.]

JUNE 16, 1864.

General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Forwarded to General Meade for information. This would show the enemy not yet on south side of James River in great force.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

[Second indorsement.]

Forwarded to Major-General Hancock. This makes it of great importance to force the enemy's lines before the troops here referred to can join those now in our front. Show this to Burnside, and push his attack and that of Birney's. I have no direct news. The main part of Lee's army is yet to come.

MEADE.

Send me the latest news.

What news from the front?
