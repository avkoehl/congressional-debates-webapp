HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, BATTALION U. S. ENGINEERS, January 4, 1865.

Bvt. Colonel J. C. DUANE,Chief Engineer, Army of the Potomac:

SIR: I have the honor to report as follows on the condition of the line: The works are in good condition; several need slight repairs, which will be attended to immediately. The infantry line is also in good condition; that to the left of Fort Keene is finished, and the battery is nearly completed; the work is roughly done, but is strong. The abatis is approaching completion, and will be finished this week; it is well fastened down, but is hardly thick enough. I will have it strengthened before leaving it. It is difficult procuring good material. The abatis in front of the Fifth and Sixth Vermont, to the left of Fort Conahey, has been covered with brush and other rubbish, making it of no account. It has been in this condition for the last ten days, and is an evident piece of neglect on the part of the regimental commanders. For the magazine in Fort Howard I shall need 200 feet of lumber.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. HOWELL,

First Lieutenant, Corps of Engineers.
