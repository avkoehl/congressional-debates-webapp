His Excellencey JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Augusta, Ga.:

The disasterin VIrginia, the capture by the enemy of all our work- shops for the prep0aration of ammunition and reairing arms, the impossibility of recruiting our little army, opposed by more then ten times its nuvmer, or of su; ; ouing it except by robbing our own citizens, destroyed all hope of successful war. I have, therfore, made a military convention with General Sheman to teminate hostilities in North and Suth Carolina, Geaorgia, and Florida. I made this convention to spare the blood of the gallant little army committed to me, to prevent further sufferings of our people by the devastation and ruin inevitable from the marches of invading armies, and to awoid the crime of waging hopless war.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
