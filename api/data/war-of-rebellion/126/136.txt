weeks thereafter (July 19) the last regiment started for home. During the interval the work, like that for General Sherman's command, was not continuous, it being interrupted and delayed by the movement of the Sixth Corps from Danville, VA., to this city and the consolidation, by orders of June 28, of the remaining portion of the army into a provisional corps, numbering, present and absent, 22,699 officers and men. Thus, for the two commands in question, and between the 29th of May and the 1st of August (two months), 279,034 officers and men, present and absent, were mustered out and placed en route to their homes. Including other armies and departments, the number was increased by August 7 (two months and seven days) to 640,806 officers and men. From the foregoing it is seen that the mass of the forces discharged were mustered out by September 14, or within two months and a half from the tie the movements of troops homeward commenced. The average per month during that time is 299,442.
