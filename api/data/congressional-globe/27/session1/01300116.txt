CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Sta'e. It was very well known that Governor Dudley
was elected by a large majority of Whig votes, and
he therefore must be supposed to be 'he exponent
of ike majority who elected him on that subject
He would refer to his message in 1840 for his opi-
nion. The Speaker, too, ol the House of Repre-
sentatives, was opposed ¿to the Bank This was
strong evidence of the mistake under which the
Senators from that State labored. He would now
ask the Secretary of Senate to read tha' part of
Governor Dudlej 's message which he bad marked.
The Secretary of the Senate then rtad the fol-
lowing passages
' 1 w raid prefer an arransement by which the local banks
would be remodelled to the establishment of a Bank of the
United states, because the renewal of then charters could be
mane to hapnen successively without pro hieing the political
convulsion which has twiceattended the íenewal of the char
ter oftheNattonal Bank, because, coo, some of thepresentin
ktuutions could be adopted and the redundant merged into
them, or allowed to expire at the end ol their chatters
"A Bank oí the United States, of sufficient capital to super
sede all the local banks, might be made an engine of oppres
ston an 1 dangerous to our poht cal institutions, which the lo
cal banks could no' The superseding the local hanks by a
National Bank must unquestionably pioducea íevolution in
the monetary affairs ofthe countiy, to an immense extent and
unforeseen consequences
"Capitalists in all countries and more p-uticulaily in ouis,
arethe pioneeisof tbeirown fortunes, and look with an eye
single to then interests on the selertionof the manageis of m
stituuous in which they invest their funds Nor are they usu
ally combined with the politician, for their notions are amago

other Stockholders are the managers of the local banks
The funds of these banks divided over as gieat an extent of
country as ours and undei the management oí their own offi
cers, p/esents an msupeiable d faculty to the formation of po
lmcal cabals oranyothei, for the injury of the great interest of
the country with whose welfaie lliey are so intimately con
nected and idennfied A National Bank might fall into the
hands ol a chqut who conscious of theip power, might be
tempted to i terJere m Federal policy, to the gieatinjury of its
pecuniary affairs, ana inflict a stab on the liberties of tho
country '
Mr MANGUM said, although the Senate can
feel but little interest in this matter, yet he would
correct an erroneous impression of the Senator
from Souih Caro'ina in supposing that he (Mr.
M) had stid that half the Van Buren psrty in
North Carolina were in favor of a United States
Bank. Mr. M had «aid no such thing What
he had «¡aid he would substantially réstale He
had sad that ihe Senatoi /torn Souih Carolina
was mistaken in supposing that this Whig party
in Nonh Carolina was stronger lhan the Bank
party Toat the Whig party, with a near ap
proach to unanimity, desired a Bank well regu-
lated and wed guarded The he (Mt M ) hid
been told by gentlemen of the highest intelligence
and respectability, that in the western part ol
North Caiolma, where the popular strei gth of the
Siale lia% the VVh g parly, wish great unanimity,
desirtd a linue' S attb Bank, and that, in nnpor
tantpoitions ot ihe V/lsi, haif, o* nearly half, of
ibe Van Ba en pany desired a i «ink, if it could be
had without then co-operation Thai the party
tr.'l had betn so effectual, they would_not break
their party connection's, and still continued to
vote against Whigs Yet, on the subject of a
Bank, they were, in convic ion and in heart, many
of them decidedly in favor oí the esiablishment
of onp.
Mr. M meniioned the name* of gentlemen
from whom he derived his information, alleging
that tii"y were of the highest respectability Mr
M said that he had cmveised with --orne Whig
tnends o. the House of Representative!*, after the
conversation oí yesterday, and that their opi
nions fully corroborated the stat menu made tohiin
last fall by his friend-, from ihe West One of the
geu'lemen, of the long st experience ard Ihe most

he felt very sure almost the entire Whig parly, and
ai least half of the Van B iren partv desired a
United Slates Bank, that, m truth, t e Van Buren
party did rot 'how opposition ex< ept m the person
oi a candidate advocating a Ban< Mr M saiJ
his other information was in correbt i . t a of his
itat «rent yeseidav, excluding tie C arlotle di-
met UtPly represented by Mr Connoi Mr M
■-aid hi> mf< rmaüon from othsr lis nets in tne
Bast and Sonfhea t was full and saiisUc'ory, that
the Bank par y was stronger ihan ihe Whig party.
Within tve immediate circle of h -s personal know-
ledge, it was undoubtedly so.   In hts own county,
until very lately, if not now, some prominent and
efficient supporters vf Van Burea were likewise
advocates of a United States Bank. However all
this may be, Mr. M felt very sure the Senator
from South Carolina was entirely mistaken in his
original proposition that the Whig party in North
Carolina was stronger than the party in favor of a
United States Bank Mr. M restricted bis re-
marks to his own State, and felt very sure that if a
well guaided and well regulated Bank shall be
established at this sess on, within six months or a
jear all agitation on the subject will cease on the
part of the people, lhat ambitious and di'ap
pointed politicians, stimulated by personal object,,
might agiiate and agitate, but they would soon find
that the sound judgment and sob r common sense
ot the great body of the people could not be lashed
into cc mmotion by all their agitations and interest-
ed appeals for the gratification of mere personal or
party objects of ambition
Mr GRAHAM begged leaved to say a word on
«his subject He was glad the Sena'or from South
Carolina had recurred to it He professed to know
something ofthe stale of r pinion in his own State,
quite as much as did any one out of it It is diffi
cult (said Mr G ) to define Ihe grounds of belief
The wishes of men are ofien fathers to their
thoughts To enable, the Senate to judge of 'he
stale of public sentiment in North Carolina on this
subject, Mr J satd he would state one or two facts
In the last Legislamie there were one hundred and
four Whigsoutof one hundred andseventv members,
and, in the election of Senators made then, the ad-
vocacy of a National Bank was the test question
Wilhm ihe laM sixty days there had been an elec
tion in all the districts of the State, for mpmhers of
the House of Representatives, an i the result had
been, thit eight members were returned who were
avowed advocates of such an institution, and only
five 8gam«t it, while in the last House of Repre-
sentatives there had been eight opponents and Jive
advocates of the measure After the tables had
been thus cimpletely turned, Mr G said he would
submit to thp candor of the honorable Senator him-
self whether he did not, m some degree at least,
doubt the correctness of the opinions on which he
seethed to he relying Th -se who would pay no
attention to thi-, would hardly believe, though on 
should rise from the dead The qu stion, as Mr
G understood, had been distinctly made, and is
distinctly decided As to the message of Governor
Dudley, Mr G said he had nt t a perfect recollec-
tion of it, not having recurred to it since a short
time at er its publication If, however, that dis-
tinguished citizen was to be cons dered ihe advoca e
of the S ate I ank deposite system, familiarly called
ihe oet bank sy-tem, Mr G said he did not then
recollect any other citizen of much prominence who
coincided m the opinion, that system hid. i ever
been advocated in that Sute bv any partv except
the supporters of the la'e Admin ¡ratio" and by
them enly «o lo->g as it was a puty me sure
Mr CALHOUN said he had not m ended to
say, on his wn, or on the authority of an.v one,
that there was not a large majority of the Whigs
of North Carolina in favor of a Bank, but that
there was a portion of the Whigs, and the Demo
cralic State Rights oa~ty slmost to n man, opposed
to it He did not know that ihe Bank w s made a
stria party que tion m Noi h Carolina, bm h  did
know tha' the State Rights party  a urimmon )y
opposed to it
Mr GRAHAVt replied that he had not mi ap-
prehended th question at issue It vas up n the
allegation of the honorable Srnator from South Ca-
rolina in reply to the Senator irmi K^ntPcky [Mr
Clay ] that the establishment of a National B¿nk
was losing ground in the South Tins assertion
his colleague ?nd hmself had undertaken t con-
trovert, as far as Notth Carolina wis concerned
True, his colleague had stated—and *o he(Vfi
G ) believed—that in many pprts of t >e S ate the
Bat k question was stronger than th  Wmg party
And, n confi'ma on tf this, !e would r milk,
tint tnree of his colleagues in the oih r branch o'
Congress (whom he had seen, casually, since tht
di'cus itn jesterday, having no expectation that
the matter was to be resumed here again) had sla-
ted to him that in their districts it was undoubtsdly
true that not only the Whigs, but many of the Van
Buren party, were favorable to the establishment
of a National Bank Conceding, therefore, as he
woald do, that five of the districts were of a con-
trary opinion, he reaffirmed that all indications
of public senttment justified the declaration that the
Bant question was not losing gtonnd in his State,
but that a decided majority were in favor of its
establishment.
The conversation here terminated
APPROPRIATION 10 THE  WIDOW   OF   GENERAL
HARRISON
The bill appropnatmg $25,000 for the relief of
the widow of General William Henry Harrison,
was takm up— he question being on its passage
Mr. PIERCE said it was his desire to have sub-
mitted some remarks suggested by an allusion of
the Senator f om Georgia [Mr Berbien] last .eve-
ning, but the manifest determination to pre s the
bill to a third, reading and the lateness of the hour,
hid daerred him     He would now, with the in-
dulgence of the Senate,  submit a few considera-
tions upon which his objections  to ihe  bill were
chiefly founded     And he would take occasion to
say in advance, that if one  fact appeared  here,
winch did  noi appear,  thst  the late President's
family were in pecuniary distress, if they were in
embarrassed   circumstancss,   no   man's   feelings
would more impe uously prompt him to give sano-
tion to this meas ire than his own, a declaration
which, whether appreciated here or not, would be
apprec ated at home.    Bat ihere were other and
higher considerations—considerations lifting them-
selves infinitely   above any ¡feelings or mo'ives
which attached themselves to individuals or fami-
lies in the land    He had net a word to say about
the constitutional power of Congress to make  this
gratuity    He would not argue thf   constitudonal
question    He had well nigh a lived at the conclu-
sion that, so taras the action of Congress was con-
cerned, (here was no Constitution—no limits of re-
striction     And he fully concurred with his friend
from Mississippi, [Mr Walker,] who spoke with
so much foice and eloquence yesterday,  that if
gentlemen would 100k for precedents, they  would
find them scattered  through  the statute book of
every session—but precedent ,let him say, m con-
flict with the Constitution, for which we all profess
so much reveruice, and mamfeat very little     Fol-
lowing that ignis/atatis—that false light of prece-
dents—gentlemen might raarch  to any extent in
any direction.   He co rcurred on this point entirely
with his friend, IMr Walker,] but he by no means
recognised the authority ot such precedents    There
was one thing rem^rkí ble  about  them—a  claim,
era principle on which claims were based, might
fall under the coioemnat on  of Ccngress  !or ten
successive sessions, and finally,  by a change of
meTibfrs, a change of views, and a warm appeal
to thfit "inward a ¡)i'er" oi which with the   Consti-
tuí on, the senator from Mas achuse ts [Mr Bates]
reposed j e«terday,lhe bill would pas«, and the bounty
wou d go form out of tne common contribution of
the  pe >ple of the country     Without any  feel-
ing; , adver e to this claim, pjhtical or otherwise,
he proles ed agams any legislation based upon our
sympathies—he protested agtmst the power and do-
m nion oí that " inward arbiter " which in private
life was aimo«t suie to lead us right, but, as pub-
lic men, and as the  dispense s of o ner  men's
means    other men's contributions—was quite as
sure to lead us wion.;    Itimde a v?st difference
whether we paid the money from our i wu pocke's,
crdre-v it f om t1 epocKets if our constituents   He
knew his weakness on this point, personally, but it
woull be his steady purpose, in «pi'e of taunts and
unwor hy imputations, to escape from it, as the re-
presentative of o hers       But h  was   departing
frota ihe object which induced him, for a moment,
to trespass upon the pa lence of t e Senate     This
c'aim did  not come from the fam ly    No gentle
