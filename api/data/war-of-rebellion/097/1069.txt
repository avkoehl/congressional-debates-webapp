C. H. WHITTELSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

PETERSBURG, May 2, 1865.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

My command will be here (Petersburg) to-morrow, the 3rd. The men and horses will need rest, and the horses require shoeing at once, which will require some days.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

RICHMOND, VA., May 2, 1865. (Received 4 p.m.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Washington:

There is a starving multitude here; we are feeding them. Some have money to purchase, but no provisions are for sale. The port was opened for domestic commerce, but the Treasury regulations will not allow clearances except on trade store permits issued by agents of the Treasury Department to goods or provisions to come to Richmond. In the meantime the Government is feeding those who could feed themselves were the provisions here for sale. Cannot this be remedied?

F. T. DENT,

Brigadier-General, Military Commander of Richmond.

PETERSBURG, May 2, 1865. (Received 10 a.m.)

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Will you please inform me if my letters of the 9th and 22nd of April have been received?

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, May 2, 1865-7.45 p.m.

Major General G. K. WARREN,

Petersburg, Va.:

Your letters of the 9th and 22nd were received, the latter during General Grant's absence. Orders have been sent you to report here, when you can see the general.

T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
