HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 1, 1864.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I shall not do anything toward the reorganization of this corps until the return of Major-General Meade.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 1, 1864 - 6 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Two deserters from the Seventh Georgia Cavalry (Hampton's) have just been brought in. They came in by the Vaughan road. They state there is but a small force of cavalry there watching our lines. No infantry. They say Hill's corps is in the trenches at Petersburg.

They will be forwarded at once.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 1, 1864.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

I inclose you a copy of instructions* to Brigadier-General Gregg. The commanding general directs that General Ayres' division be prepared to support General Gregg at daylight to-morrow, and that the commander of the division report to-day to General Gregg for instructions. As it would interfere with his duties as a member of the Court of Inquiry, General Ayres need not accompany the division.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 1, 1864 - 8.30 p. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have learned what General Gregg has directed my infantry to do in his support in the morning. It would be much simpler for us here to send General Crawford's division. It is all in reserve, while General Ayres' is all in the lines, except about 500 out on picket. General Crawford has as many as General Ayres. I think General Ayres ought to go if his division goes, and he ranks General Gregg, as does General Crawford.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
