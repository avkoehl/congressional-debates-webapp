from the fact that the enemy enveloped Warren's right before he was aware of it. I withdrew the troops from north of the James River last night, and now the Second Corps must be nearly in supporting distance of Warren.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 21, 1864-1.30 p.m.

(Received 22nd.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

The enemy came out and attacked General Warren between 10 and 11 a.m., but were repulsed with great ease. No loss reported on our side except General Cutler, slightly wounded, and Colonel Dushane, killed. General Warren reports 400 prisoners captured that he knows of; there may be more. I am expecting a heavy attack this afternoon, and preparing for it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 21, 1864.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding,&amp;c.:

Is the firing now heard on Warren's front? If so the enemy should be opened upon by the Ninth and Eighteenth Corps, and their line threatened.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 21, 1864-10 a.m.

General GRANT:

I send a dispatch* from Warren explanatory of the firing which has been resumed within the last few minutes. Hancock is moving up; also Parke with his Fourth Division. Warren, on the defensive, ought to be able not only to hold his position, but to punish the enemy severely, and undoubtedly would if we could only get our troops to act with the audacity the enemy show.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 21, 1864-10.25 a.m.

General GRANT:

I have ordered Ord and Mott to open with their batteries and make all the demonstrations they can against the enemy.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
