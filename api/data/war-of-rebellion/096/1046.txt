WILMINGTON, January 13, 1865-2 p. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Richmond:

Enemy has effected a landing on the narrow sand spit east of Masonborough Sound, and several miles above former point. With the sound intervening we could not possibly prevent this, but it gives him no advantage. Hoke confronts him, and I move down immediately. The monitors have opened fire on Fort Fisher; so far without effect.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, N. C., January 13, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Petersburg:

COLONEL: Herewith you will receive a copy* of an inspection report of the quartermaster and subsistence department at the post of Raleigh. These officers and their employees are not under my control, except as inspections. The reports are not sufficiently explicit, and corrections have been ordered; enough is developed, however, to show the necessity of purification. I can see no necessity for guard and watchmen other that the regular guards from the military post, nor can I see under what law soldiers on guard are paid extra. The number of employees seems excessive, especially clerks. An able-bodied conscript is employed, too, s paymaster, and called an expert.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., January 13, 1865.

General W. H. C. WHITING,

Wilmington, N. C.:

Your superior in rank, General Bragg, is charged with the command and defense of Wilmington.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NORTH CAROLINA,Wilmington, January 13, 1865.

Major J. W. CAMERON,

Chief Quartermaster, Wilmington:

General Bragg directs you keep a small steamer constantly at the forts at the mouth of the river for purposes of communication. The general wishes you to procure without delay a lantern, in which a candle may be used, for his headquarters in the field.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
