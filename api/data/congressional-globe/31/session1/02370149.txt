form the service which the Government of the

fornia, on their return, or on their progress out, so
great the amount of property involved, so great

them out or bring them back at a fair price. _

ciated in the eastern and northern parts of the
country. Several meetings had been held on that
subject in the city of Boston, attended by a large
number of respectable and enterprising persons,
