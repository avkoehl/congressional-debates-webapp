crossed above Panola on Sunday. The patrols must be kept moving and well out on the different roads. They will be instructed to report promptly any information to these headquarters.

Your men will be required to take the best possible care of their horses, and none will be allowed to come into the city on horseback unless on duty or in charge of an officer. The shoeing will be pushed forward rapidly.

Major-General.

Colonel S. G. HICKS:

Demonstrations are made on Columbus, but may mean Paducah.

Keep your forces ready. Captain Shirk will stay with you. Let no boats come down.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAIRO, ILL., April 13, 1864.

Colonel S. G. HICKS,

Paducah:

Captain Pennock will telegraph you about the shell. Your ammunition went up; I fear it was carried by. All safe at Columbus. Fort Pillow said to have been taken.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAIRO, April 13, 1864-8.30 p.m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Nashville:

The surrender of Columbus was demanded and refused at 6 this morning. Women and children brought away. Heavy artillery firing this forenoon. I have sent re-enforcements. Paducah also threatened. No danger of either, but I think that Fort Pillow, in the Memphis district, is captured. General Shepley passed yesterday and saw the flag go down, and thinks it a surrender. I have enough troops now from below and will go down if necessary to that point.

Captain Pennock will send gun-boats. If lost, it will be re-taken

immediately.

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General.
