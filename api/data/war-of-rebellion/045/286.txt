Generals Ewell, Walker, "Extra Billy" Smith, and Hays took up their headquarters day before yesterday at house 2 miles from Shepherdstown, on the Winchester pike. Large bodies of troops can be seen from South Mountain, at Antietam Furnace, by aid of glasses. Cavalry and pickets were drawn in this morning beyond Boonsborough. All of which may be considered as reliable.

LEESBURG, June 24, 1863.

General HOOKER:

I have had all the fords within 10 miles of Edwards Ferry examined. Young's Island Ford, 3 miles below Edwards Ferry, is the best one, and can be crossed with trains. White's Ford, 2 miles above Edwards, is next in point of practicability, but is very difficult, and I would not dare to attempt crossing a train at night. The river is quite high.
