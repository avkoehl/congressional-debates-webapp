common medium of exchange and ptyment An -uc-h tliey
were used and had long been used by all civi 17 ed nations, ?nd
they formt-d an international currency They weie the money
of the commercial world.
But the metals in use as money are difficult to count, to keep,
to cairy, ard to transmit, they are expensive, and, as money,
are utterly unproductive, and if theie was nothing else in use
as currency, their price would fluctuate enoimously, with ava
riable demand, supposing it pos&ihle that trade could be carried
On at all is it now is
But it would not he possible to carry on trade and com neiceex
tensively with gold and bit ver only for cuuency Theimpouand

be not less than 2000 milloi*< andthe sum uf out intund

course, H would be impossible to count, kef p canv or trans
nut such an amount ot specie Not one fiftieth part ofthe
trade could be carried on that now is, and pioducuon would
almost wholly cease, or, if it is possible to conceive tl at
tra e could be carried on extensively m the way suggested, the
very cost of the medium of exchange would produce in en-
hancement of puces which cou dnot be tolciatrd
Well, said Mr B , necessity has driven the rommemal woild
to some very simple and effectual expedients 0 obviate the in
conveniences arising iiomihe exclusive u&e n metal money
in carrying on external and oreisrn nil ieioi is had to
what are called bilis of exchange These are simply a papei
tule to so much coin ot bullion, a1* may be expressed on the
face ofthe papei in the hands «f the diawet The hoid r is
satisfied tobe the owner ofthe mi tal, and is hegeneialiy him
self holds it merely for sale and tiansler'o somebody else, he
d  ps not trouble himself about the attual pubse&sion 7hiw,
indeed, is the very inconvenience whie' is to be avoided in the

in about as much moie, and the who e amount ot Fpecie *ent

In domestic trade and dealings, resoit is ha J to three modes
of making payments, by wh ch theneccst y of. tnploymg a d

asm foreign trade Ano hens by deposites in bmk, rd the
simple transfer ot credu&on the booke of the bank from the ic

this mode, to the amourtof ten miliior t Aroth°i mndt f

very apt to be met by more isstics and more circulation But

the plain and obvious course is (o increase loans, not of circula-

take caie, by tht terms of its chaiter to puta strict and pretty
narrow limit to the amount ot us circulation—thatespecially
which sht utd be out on loan—as compared with its loanable
capital The way m which this should be done I shall indicate
