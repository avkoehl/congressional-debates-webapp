wealth and influence of that corporation, and its
direct interest in connecting the railroad with a
regular line of boats to New Orleans, there was
every reason to expect a prompt and faithful per-
formance of the stipulated service. Some delay
was to be expected owing to the magnitude of the
enterprise, but I did not permit myself to doubt
that the service would commence as soon as prac-
ticable. To my surprise, however, after waiting
some time for a report on the subject, I received
a letter, dated 16th July last-, from the Vice Pres-
ident of the Illinois Central Railroad Company,
informing me of a failure to organize a line of
boats, and submitting new propositions, which I
could not consistently entertain. In a letter dated
17th September, he wrote again, inclosing a pro-
posal from another party at $350,000 per annum.
I answered, on the 2d October, that 1 must require
the railroad company to perform service on the
terms agreed upon, and to, commence in two
weeks from that date, and that, in case of failure
to do so, it would be my imperative duty to ad-
vertise the route for a reletting, and to hold the
company responsible for the difference, if any,
between the sum contracted for by it, and that
which I should have to pay under the advertise-
ment. Under date of 6tn October, the company
replied to my letter of the 2d, but expressed no
intention of commencing service; and, after wait-
ing until the 20th October, I advertised the route,
inviting proposals until 30th November, to be
decided by 3d December, and service to com-
mence 1st January, 1856.
In making this statement it is but proper I
should add, that, in my opinion, the directors of
the Illinois Central Railroad Company used every
exertion in their power to comply with their en- !
gagements, but failed to do so, owing to the very
high prices demanded of them by the owners of !
the boats. A comparison of the prices paid for
steamboat service by the Department, in every !
part of the Union, shows that the highest price ,
given per mile is $191 25, and this on an import- 1
ant route, on which the contractors are subject to
an extraordinary outlay in the payment of a toll ,
at Grant's Passjbutthatthe average price is $60 60 ;
per mile. At the sum "of $180,000, the price j
agreed to be given to the Illinois Central Railroad j
Company, the rate per mile would be $169 96; i
■but if $350,000, the price demanded from the rail- ;
road company, were paid, the cost per mile would j
reach the very high rate of $350 50—a price which
could not have been contemplated by Congress
when the act of 1854 was passed.
The mails across the Isthmus of Panama are
conveyed by the Panama Railroad Company, but 1
without any regular contract. The service has |
been satisfactorily performed. For the year end- |
ing 1st December, 1851, at which time this service j
was transferred from the contractors under the !
New Granadian government to the Panama Rail- I
road Company, the entire weight of the mails j
transported over the isthmus was 298,728pounds,
at a cost, including the isthmus expenses of the
route agents in charge, of about $51,000, being
a fraction over seventeen cents a pound. The
weight for the year ended 31st March, 1855, was
607,674 pounds, which was paid for at the rate
of 22 cents a pound, making the total cost of i
the transportation amount to $133,688 68. By i
the act of 3d March, 1851, the Postmaster Gen- !
eral was authorized "to enter into contracts or j
make suitable arrangements for transporting the
mails between Chagres and Panama with regu-
larity and dispatch, provided the rate of com-
pensation shall not exceed twenty-two cents a
pound." Under this authority the PanamaRail-
road Company has been paid the full maximum
compensation of twenty-two cents a pound from
1st of December, 1851, to 1st April, 1855, since
which I have recognized their service, and
ordered payment to be made at eighteen cents a
pound. The railroad was completed in January,
1855; the locomotive for the first time passed over
the entire route on the 28th, and the mail was for
the first time carried through by steam on the
29th of that month. The road being completed,
and the company havihg made a considerable
deduction in their freight charges, the reduced
price for first-class freight in no instancgexceed-
tng fifteen ce nts a pou nd, I considered that eighteen
cents was a liberal compensation for the mail.
In fixing this sum, I took into consideration the
gat cost of the road, the sacrifice both of life
ana property in its construction, the magnitude
of the enterprise, and its importance in a national
point of view. The company have declined to
acquiesce in this decision, and claim to receive
the full maximum price of twenty-two cents until
a permanent contract shall be made at a fixed
annual sum.
The new distribution schemes referred to in
my last annual report have been completed, and
sent to the several distributing post offices. This
work involved a minute examination of all the
mail arrangements of the country, with a view
to a definite.allotment for each distributing office,
so as to insure the transmission of mails in all
cases by the most direct and expeditious route,
and at the same time to guard against the too
frequent distributions which have heretofore pre-
vailed. Each distributing office has now alpha-
betical lists of all the counties in all the States,
(except California,) with the proper distribution
point annexed to each county. Thus, the post-
masters have the plainest instruction as to the
proper distribution of mail matter for every por-
tion of each State. There are, in all, 1,645 coun-
ties, formed into 757 different groups, to suit the
several distributing offices, and show the course
of the mail from each office to every county in
the Union, and the whole number of points
thus indicated for the fifty distributing offices is
82,250.
| In my last annual report I recommended the
J adoption of a system of registration for giving ;
j greater security to valuable letters intrusted to !
! the mails. By the third section of an act approved
March 3, 1855, Congress authorized the Post-
master General to provide means by which any
person desiring to post a valuable letter to be sent
by mair might, at his option, have it registered
upon payment of a fee of five cents in addition
to the rate of postage chargeable thereon, it
having been estimated that this additional pay- 1
ment would cover the expenses incident to such
registration. To carry into effect the authority :
thus granted by Congress, it became necessary [
to prepare and distribute among the several post j
offices blanks for a new system of accounts, to
show, in respect to registered letters, not only !
the receiving and sending of each mail, as formerly, '
but the receiving, sending, and delivery of each >
particular letter. These blanks, with accompany- !
| mg instructions, were prepared and distributed '
: as early as possible after the passage of the act j
referred to, and were in the possession of each ■
postmaster before the commencement of the fiscal j
year, (1st July, 1855.) when it went into operation. !
To guard as much as possible against the mistakes
and errors likely to arise from innovation upon
the.long established forms in which postmasters'
accounts had been kept, 1 preserved and adapted
these forms to the new requirements of the law,
and have thus endeavored, by the simplest means
possible, to secure uniformity and accuracy in the
keeping and rendering of the accounts. A just!
estimate of the value and ultimate success of the j
plan of registration adopted cannot be formed j
from the short experience had of it. Its opera-
tion brings to the immediate knowledge of.the
Department not only every failure, but every
delay in the transportation and delivery of regis-
tered letters; and in carefully observing its oper-
ation, with a view to such modifications as may
be required, I have in each day's report found
abundant proofs of its usefulness, and also of
the necessity of perfecting it by such means as
experience may suggest.
By arrangements with Prussia and Bremen,
the registry system has been extended to letters
conveyed between the United States and Ger-
many. (See articles of agreement annexed.)
The expenditures of the Department for the
last fiscal year are reported by the Auditor to
have amounted to $9,968,342 29* under the fol-
lowing heads—to wit:
Compensation to postmasters $2,135,335 22
Ship, steamboat, and way letters  18,766 28

Payment of balances due Great Britain  302,859 71
Payment of balances due Bremen  13,465 40
$9,968,342 29
The grosff revenue of the Department derived
from postages, (inland and foreign,) from stamps
and stamped envelopes sold, and from miscella-
neous sources, amounted in the last fiscal year to
$6,642,136 13, to wit:
From letter postage $3,234,549 67
Stamps and stamped envelopes sold... 2,511,318 03
Newspapers and pamphlets  638,927 51
Fines  35 00
Emoluments returned  77,902 82
Letter-carriers    143,312 93
Dead letters  4,976 01
Extra compensation overcharged..... 23,330 82
Miscellaneous receipts  7,783 34
Add the annual appropriations made in com-
pensation of mail service to the Govern-
ment by the acts of the 3d March, 1847,
and 3d March, 1851 
$6,642,136 13
700,000 00
$7,342,136 13
To state precisely the amount of gross revenue
which accrued within the last fiscal year, the bal-
ance against the United States, resulting from
our postal accounts with Great Britain, Prussia,
and Bremen, must be deducted.
| The amount of balances due to England on the fiscal year
I 1855 was about  $70,553 86
i The balances due to Bremen for the year.... 6,130 37
From the foregoing deduct the balances due
the United States by Prussia for the year..
76,653 23
69,694 11
6,959 IS
If, then, the above balance of $6,959 12 be deducted from
the aggregate of $7,342,136 13, the actual gross revenue
of the Department for the fiscal year ending 30th June,
1855, will be $7,335,177 01
The gross revenue of 1854, after deducting for-
eign balances, amounted to  6,816,657 91
Difference in favor of 1855  518,519 10
Being an increase of 7 3-5 per cent.
The expenditures of the Department for the year 1855, as
before stated, were $9,968,342 29
The gross revenue, as reported by the Auditor,
including foreign postages and the annual
appropriation of $700,000 for mail service
rendered to Government, was  7,342,136 13
Excess of expenditure in 1855   2,626,206 16
If to the foregoing excess of expenditure be
added the balance of accounts closed by " bad
debts," " compromised debts,"and "suspense
account," amounting by the Auditor's statement
to $649 99, then the entire excess for the vear
will be $2,626,856 15.
In my last annual report I stated that the
expenditures of 1855 would, owing to causes not
within the control of the Department, greatly
exceed those of the previous year, and I then
briefly adverted to some of those causes. Sub-
sequently, other items of increase, to which I
shall presently allude, were added by acts of Con-
gress. The commissions allowed to postmasters
under the act of 3d March, 1853, had proved in-
sufficient at a few offices to defray the expenses
of their administration, and an authority was
asked to make additional allowances in such
special cases, which could not, in all, according
to the estimate of the Auditor, have involved an
increase of expense exceeding $45,000 a year;
but with the authority to grant special relief, the
act of Congress, approved June 22, 1854, gave a
general increase of commissions, the effect of
which upon the expenditures for " compensation
to postmasters" and " clerks for the post offices"
