HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE BORDER, Camp on Big Blue, October 21, 1864-5 p. m. (Received 11 p. m.)

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I am confident I can stop Price at this crossing, and hope you will come up in his rear and left so he cannot get out by Hickman Mills. If you can get that position we bag Price, if I succeed, as I hope to do. My losses have been considerable, but my troops are in good order, and ready to make a stand at this place.

S. R. CURTIS,Major-General.

INDEPENDENCE, October 21, 1864-10.15 a. m.

Major S. S. CURTIS:

The enemy has appeared in my front and I will take some of my best troops and move forward. Those who come after should congregate at the Big Blue, or as near there as we can get them to make a stand. The Big Blue and Kansas City are the strong points for final efforts. I shall move cautiously; we are all well.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

CAMP ON BIG BLUE, October 21, 1864.

Captain WILLIAMS:

The fighting has continued all day. My troops have behaved well. I am now with the militia, in a very strong position, which Price cannot attack to-night and cannot take to-morrow; I think not at all. Major Smith was killed. Cannot as yet tell my losses, but they are considerable.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

(Same to all post commanders.)
