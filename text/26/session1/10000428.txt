APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April, 1840.
26th Cong ••••1st Sfss.
Jlppropria'ion Bill—Mr. Duncan.
H. of Reps.
were ct rnfortably enwrapped, you had an armlul
oí health and firmness Tluse constituted my
pleasures in the tlays of log cabins, and th s
is a description ot 1 g cabins, which, so far as it
goes-, will be recognised by tho-e who have been
reared in the Western country. But, sir, the da>s
ol los; cabins have parsed away in the older
settlements ot the "West, and with them,
mo«t of the log cabins, and with the kg
cabins, many ot the amusements common
to such tenements All the older pioneers
ot the We^t and their descendant--, who have
observed that kind ot prudence, industry, and
economy, which constitute the character of the
good citizen, and entit'e him to the confidence of
hrne^t men, have possessed themselves of comfort-
ab e ard commodious brick and frarre houses,
lar<-e barns, and well improved farms checkered
with grain fields of e\er) color, and mant'ed with
hor-es, cattle, sheep, and hngs, and with hard cash
for a rainy day, and some to lend a friend in
need.
General Harrison was one of the earliest settlers
of the West. Why is be not provided with the
means, too, of comforting the sundown of his life?
It would seem, if he had possessed the ordinary
prudence, industry, economy, and "-lability com-
mon to the pioneers of the Wt-t, and which has
raised them from indigence to comfort and eace,
and some of them to affluence, he would not now
necessarily be the hnmble tenant of a leg cabin
and have to toil his winter-beaten frame m thechnl
of old age, for h'S daily bread. How does this
mat'er stand' It has become our du'y and our in-
terest to inquire, for if his poverty is the result of
misfortunes ard untoward circumstances, over
which he could have hid n j control, then r> it a
virtue, rather than a fault, and claims commisera-
t on. But if it s the re^u't of imprudence, extra-
vagance, or of ill-directed judgment, the fault
is his own, and such faults and frai'ties clear-
ly render him unfit to be the Executive ru-
ler of a great and powerful nation. What
have been kis misfortune? and what his op-
por unities' I profess to be «omewbat acquainted
with the history of General Harrison's poli'ioil,
military, and pnvate life I am| his neighbor, and
live in his crvmty As to his private life, I know
of no stain that for a moment «ullis? him 1 be-
lieve he is stnctly honest, 1 believe he is liberal,
but not so to a fault I have never heard of any
pecuniary misfortunes the lot of that man, and I
think his history (and, by the by, let ire here say,
that I have very little confidence in the history of
a man written and publis-hed in his life time, such a
history is very apt to be colored and bedizened with
adu'ation and flattery) represent him as the de-
scendant of "noble bioorf," of highly respectable
and wealthy parentage Wealthy p^ren age?
Then he received at his outset a patrimony. What
has become of that? Why, if it was not borne
away upon the w ngs of misfortune, perhaps it
■was a sacrifice to the inexperience of youth. Be
it ^o That is not to be cha-ged to him as a fault
now; nor doe  it make him the less capab'e of dis-
charging important official duties, f r which be
may have qualification". But his history (verbal
if not writen) represents him as having received a
large foitune in lands of the most valuable qua'ity,
and the most elegible location, by his marriage.
What has become of that ftrtune? For its flight
it will not be so easy to find an apology,
for on its reception, he was in the vigor
and wi'dom of manhood ; with hs mind at its
strength, and with a judgment at it  full size
But if the log cabin and the poverty story is true,
that estate is in some way disposed of. But that is
not all. General Harrison has held profitable of-
fices from his boyhood. With but little intermis-
sion to this day, bis hand has been in the public
Treasury. Ye«, sir, almost without interregnum,
through a life as Jong as the Divine promise—for
I believe be is now on the verge ef the horizon of
Urne score and ten—and at this moment holds an
office worth, I think, clear and clean of all expen-
ses, fiv  thousand dollar  per annum. I think I
may ventare to say G-eneral Harrison has received
fr tm public Treasuries more than one hundred
t&eosaid dollars.   He has drawn mor* from the
public Trev-urv than a six-hcrseteam can haul, in
hard dollars, over the Alleghany mountains, on the
national road, and vet his political part suns c'aim
for him the Presidency because he is poor and
needy. What has become of this last vast estate?
Can his friends answer'!
Why, sir, so far from General Harrison being
unfortunate, he has been one of fortune's cho cest
and most cherished children. Now, sir, perm t me
to ask, if General Harrison's poverty gives him a
claim upon the American people either lor po meal
patronage, or even more than common sympathy;
certa nly not, unless it can be shown clearly that he
has bren reduced to poverty by misfortunes and
calamines bejond his control. While it is a settled
principle, honorable to the American cha-
racter, that the virtuous and qualified poor man
is preferred to the virtuous and qualified rich man
for office, let hs inquire whether, when poverty is
the result of extravagance, profligacy, indolence, a
weak mind, a bad-direcfed judgment or misma-
nagement, it does not constitute a disqualification
to hold a responsible s'ation of an official charac-
ter. Permit me to ask, if the man who has not
had the capacity to secure a competency for the
evening of his life out of such vast resources, can
safely be trusted with the administration of this
Government? I ask tne question in the spirit of
candor and truih, and it becomes every American
to ask the same question. Is the man who has
not the ability to control and manage his own
«■mall and circumscribed domest c concerns, the
suitable man in whose hand to place the destinies
of this nation—the management of this wide-
spread and complicated Federal Union, whose har-
mony and who^e duration—whose prosperity at
home, and whose character abroad, depend upon
its jnd cious law, (heir best direction, and able
and faithful exeeution? A patriotic and intelligent
people will answer th's question.
But, sir, I will now come to the rescue of Ge-
neral Hampón, and relieve htm from the incapa-
city which his own friends have virtually and
indirectly charged upen him. General Harrison
is not a poor man; he does not live in a leg cabin;
nor does he toil m sweat and dust for his living.
He is a rich man, he lives in a magn ficent frame
house, and is surrounded with a princely estate, of
as good land as ever the Nile inundated, and as
handsomely and advantageously located as any
past which the majest c floods of the Ohio or Mis-
sissippi roll, from their sources to the Gulf of
Mexico So, sir, all this story about the log cabin
is a falsBhood. It is a mean fraud, attempted to
be practised upon the credulity and sympathies of
the American people, for the base, demagogical
purposes of political deception. General Harrison
is neither to be cherished nor repudiated by the log
cabin fiction the whole is a hoax, attempted to be
p'ayed oft for political effect, and worthy of a
party who have a contempt for the understanding
and intell genes of what they call the "common pte-
ple " Such attempts never fail to meet the seorn
an! derision of an honest and intelligent commu-
nitv, when and wherever made.
But indulge me while I attempt t«i expose ano-
ther inconsistency involved in the log cabin hoax
Who were the active agents by which Gen. Harri-
son was presented as a candidate for the Presiden-
cy? The humb'e inmates of log cabins, think you,
sir? No The conventions by which Gen. Harri-
son's nomination was brought forth, in nine indi-
vidual instances out often, were composed of any
thing but the laboring man of the log cabin. They
were composed of, and controlled by, those who
have neither attachments nor feelings for the log
cabin class of community, further than to subserve
their own purposes, further than to make them
subservient to the establishment of a system of po-
licy by which they may be made hewers of wood
and drawers of water to the Federal aristocracy of
this country. I am not in possession of the names
of the individuals composing the different State
Federal conventions, nor of the nam  ol the dele-
gate! composing the National Federal Conventiom
held at Harnsburg, consequently I can say nothing
of their professions and occupations, farther than
relates to my own State. I hold in my hand a
aewgpaper containing the report and proceedings
of the convention held in Ohio, and containing the
names of those who composed that convention. I
have extracted a table from that report, which
shows the number of bank officers, bank directors,
and bank stockholders, office holder*, lawyers, and
doctors, merchants, clerks, speculators, &c. Here
it is. It tells a poor story for the log cabin and
laboring interests of this country. I am told by
members here that this table will serve to illustrate
the character of other State conventions, as well as
the composition of the Harnsburg convention.
But here is the table; read for yourself. Here are
the names, facts, and figures. They expose the
miserable attempt to palm General Harrison upon
the psople as "the log cabin and the poor tnem's can-
didate " Shame • where is thy blush? Truth and
candor, where are thy advocates? Justice and ho-
nor, have je been dethroned, and have moral de-
pravity and debased political ambition, usurped
your seats? But here is the table-
Principal composition of the Ohio Federal- Whig Abo-
lition Convention.

Just look, sir' five hundred and forty-two bank
officers, director*, «fee. seven hundred and thirty-
three office holders, three hundred and forty-six
lawyers and doctors, and one thousand and forty-
eight merchants, clerks, and speculators, in one
State convention, in all twenty-six hundred and
sixty-nine, representing the interests of the poor
man ■ and the laboring community, and presenting
General Harrison as the log cabin candidate ' Sir,
if I could speak to every laborer in this land, I
would sav to him, "beware of wslvts in sleep's cloth-
ing " These men will caress and flatter you until
your suffrage is cast, and then they will order you
to stand back "like a poor man at a dance " I
would say look out when merchants, lawyers, doc-
tors, bankers, speculators, and Shylocks, assume
the guardianship of ) our interests and your liber-
ties. All the flattering caresses that the laborer or
the poor man will receive from such a party, will
result from the same motive that induced the fox
to praise the music of the crow, which was to ob-
tain the flesh which she would let drop in the act of
singing.
I assert that the supporters of General Harrison
are not the friends of the poor and laboring classes
of the community, and those who live in log cabías.
On the contrary, they are those who seek the esta-
