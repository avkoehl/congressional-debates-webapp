THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 13,
Mr. Chairman, there is attached to the Secre-
tary's report on the finances the report of the en-
gineer in charge of the public buildings. It will
be found at page 105 ofvthe report of 1857-58.
There, sir, the monstrous facts a,re all collected;
and any gentleman who examines it will see that
this trust fund, originally intended to provide for
the support of sick and disabled seamen, is now
misapplied to the maintenance of a set of perhaps
sick and disabled politicians. He will there find
that of this fund, thus wrung from the hard earn-
ings of the sailors, a good share of it finds its way
into the pockets, and provides for the solace of
others than him. He will find that as the conse-
quence of that desire which seems to have become
almost universal of building a custom-house
where there is a port of entry, of buildingra post
office where a mail can go, and of building an
hospital, even where there is not a sailor to enter
it—nearly every dollar of the fund has been di-
verted from its original purpose, and sustains,at
this hour, an army of doctors and nurses and
porters and gate-keepers and commissioners and
clerks, almost as numerous as those who apply
to become the recipients of their own bounty.
To such an extent, Mr. Chairman, has this abuse
extended, that you wiil find that in one place
$11,000 a year and upwards is stated to have
been appropriated to the maintenance of sea-
men, anu of course to the payment of a corps of
liveried officials, where it is not reported that one
single dollar of hospital money was collected
from those who have availed themselves of this
bounty.
Sir, the result shows that it cost, the last fiscal
year, to maintain these hospitals, and to provide
for the comparatively few sailors who receive
assistance, $190,000 more than the whole sum
derived from the deductions fiom the wages of
sailors. Originally this was otherwise. So long
as the fund was economically, and, I may add,
honestly administered, so long there was a sur-
plus; and the first departure from sound policy
on this subject occurred when, finding a surplus
in the Tieasury, Congress went to work, as it
always does, to find some means to spend the
money. The first appropriation for the construc-
tion of these hospitals was made, I believe, from
the surplus fund accumulated ou^of these seized
earnings of the mariner.
Now, I cannot illustrate the existing state of
things in respect of our marine hospitals better
than by having read, from the report of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury, a letter addressed to him
in the month of October last, by the collector of
the port of Burlington, Vermont, showing that
we haven marine hospital in Vermont which cost
$39,111 27, and which requires £4,000 to furnish
Jt, where $250 per annum will suffice to support
all the sick and disabled seamen within that dis-
trict, under the system of taking care of disabled
sailors which would prevail but for our dcstiuc-
tive extiavngance. Two hundred and fifty dol-
lars per annum, economically applied, appeal s to
be an ample sum to provide for sick and disabled
seamen in that district, where wc have expended
nearly forty thousand dollais for a hospital, and
where it is necessary that we should expend thou-
sands per annum in order to maintain it I The
Clerk will please read the letter which I send to
the desk, and which will be found in the report
of the Seciotary of the Treasury on the finances
for the fiscal year 1857-58, at pa^e 106.
The Clerk read the letter, as follows:

'Pardon me, sir, for intruding my opinions upon you, but
such being my honest convictions, I have felt it my duty

matter of furnishing and organizing the hospital was discie-
uonary with the Depainnent.

Mr. CLARK, of New York. Mr. Chairman,
the table of receipts and expenditures, which
will be found in the same report, (p. 142,) exhibits
the great discrepancies in the receipts and dis-
bursements of the hospital money, and conclu-
sively shows that the system is too extravagant
to last. The following is the statement:

Mr. Chairman, the letter from Collector Bow- j
dish furnishes a practical and truthful illustration '
of the abuses which this system of marine hospi- ■
talsengenders. But the chapter of the biil to which !
I speak, so far from yielding to the remonstrances -
of the Secretary of the Treasury, and of the engi- i
neer in charge of the accounts of construction, (A. !
II. Bowman,) against this system, perpetuates it, !
and by its very terms provides a fund by which the
perpetuation of this monstrous system is to be se-
cured. Gentlemen of the committee will find the '
provision for the perpetuity of this system in the J
twenty-sixth scction of tins chapter, (page 265 of 1
the bill.) That section provides afund, the amount J
of which I do not feel prepared accurately to esti- 1
mate. I am satisfied, however, that those who have \
attempted to estimate it place it at a sum far too low. 1
This twenty-sixth section provides that the mon- ,
eys collected by means of the imposition of a ton- j
nagc due of thiee cents upon every registry of an
American vessel, of an additional tonnage due of '
three cents upon every entry, (not to exceed two
in one year,) of a tonnage due of five cents to be '
imposed upon every foreign vessel arriving at our
ports, together with such countervailing, diserim-*
mating, or other tonnage duties as may be levied
and paid on ships or vessels, and the duty of five ;
per centum paid on the issue of registers to Amer- j
ican built vessels sold to foreigners and repur- ■
chased by citizens of the United States, and all
that proportion of all fines, penalties, and forfeit- ;j
ures accruing to the United States for violations )\
of the provisions of the revenue, legisteri rig, nav- !
igation, and passenger laws, and certain other fees ;j
are ail gathered together into one vast fund, and
forever appropriated by the twenty-sixth section
of this bill. The last clause of the section is this:
" be, and are hereby, appropriated for the relief
of sick and disabled seamen." Wc need trouble
ourselves no further after the passage of this bill
in looking after the gross expenditures of these
marine hospitals. The law executes itself. The
Secretary of the Treasury, for the time being, may
take this fund and may, at his pleasure, follow
out this policy of building hospitals to enrich those
who live in their neighborhoods,and cieating those
establishments for the purpose of providing placcs
for doctors and nurses and all the classes of men,
other than sailors, who live upon these, expendi-
tures from the public Treasury.
Now, sir, 1 stand opposed to all such legisla-
tion as this. I insist that Congress shall not sur-
render the immediate and annual supervision,
which, under the existing system, will be exer-
cised as often as it shall become necessary to ap-
propriate for the deficiency of these expendi-
tures, which swell from year to year, and will
continue to increase until the whole plan shall be
abandoned. Sir, I observe in the estimates of ap-
propriations that we are called upon to provide
$150,000 for the deficiency for the past fiscal year.
But this bill provides a sufficient fund for any
ordinary extravagance. It is said that there will
never be a deficiency again. Here is a vast fund
to be coUectcd periodically from the commerce of
the woikljto provide for the perpetuation of a
system which, I have been informed since I came
into the House this morning, received the univer-
sal condemnation of the Thirty-Fourth Congress.
But, sir, the Treasury is to be relieved. My hon-
orable friend from New York [Mr. Joiin Coch-
rane] stated, in opening this debate, that not
one dollar was to be drawn from the Treasury.
Hence, these Treasury sentinels thatl see around
me need not be alarmed. I say to my friend from
Tennessee, [Mr. Jones,] cease your vigilance,
and cease your anxiety, for the chairman of the
Committee on Commerce says that not a dollar
is to come out of the Treasury, to support this
lavish and reckless system.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. They take the
money before it gets into the Treasury.
Air. CLARK, of New York. Yes, sir; it is
seized on its way to the Treasury, and immedi-
ately misappropriated.
But where is this fund to come from? By
the bill as it was first presented, this burden was
taken off the mariner and imposed upon the ship-
owner, as a tonnage due. If, Mr. Chairman, it
may be questioned whether Congress has the
right to force from the earnings of any man a
sum that is to provide for the support of another,
well may we hesitate befoie we adopt the theory
that it is the business of Congress to levy taxes
upon one class of citizens for the purpose of pro-
viding for the sick and disabled of another. The
only pretense or justification of the policy upon
which the legislation of 1798-99 rests, is that the
money belongs to the sailor, and that all you do
is to guard him against that traditionary reckless-
ness which results from the hazards to which his
life is constantly exposed. But, sir, the amend-
ments which have been introduced by my col-
league since this bill was made the special order,
have, if I understand them aright, (and if I am
wrong, my friend, the chairman of the Commit-
tee on Commerce, will correct me,) provides that
these tonnage dues, although paid in the first in-
stance by the ship-owner upon the entry of his
ships, and, as tonnage dues, are to be reimbursed
by deduction from the earnings of the mariner.
Am I right?
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I believe my col-
league is right.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. If I am right,
while the Secretary of the Treasury substantially
recommends an abolition of the whole system
of marine hospitals, because it is wrong while
the bill as originally reported proposes to take
this burden from the manner and impose it upon
the ship-owner, the amendment throws it back
upon the poor mariner. Now, if my learned
friend—and I can soy to the House that for years
I have been' familiar with his accuracy and Ms
faithfulness to every subject committed to his
charge—can tell me the amount which will be
raised under the provisions of this bill to be ap-
propnuted to this particular purpose, I shall feel
under obligations to him.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I will do so with
great pleasure. The amount that will probably
be raised under the provisions of this bill the first
year after it goes into effect, will be $418,981; for
all subsequent years at the rate of $344,9G1 an-
nually.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. Mr. Chairman,
I think that statementis too moderate; and I think
I can show that is far below the true sum. Yet,
if it be accurate, while $355,000 is the whole fund
expended during the last fiscal yearfor the support
of sailors and the maintenance of those hospitals,
