CENTREVILLE, October 9, 1862-3.55 p.m.

(Received 4.13 p.m.)

Major HUNT,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Arlington House:

I have to report the return here of my command. There were no locomotives at Rappahannock Station, the bridge having been repaired about eight days ago, and the locomotives taken off. There is a small force at Rappahannock and patrolling the river; as near as I could learn, about one small brigade of infantry, two regiments of cavalry, and two batteries. The battery we took was badly broken down, and reported by the captain as unfit for duty, when about 8 miles from the river. I did not deem it advisable, for that reason, to move the battery beyond that point, or to attempt to engage the force there. I will report in person this evening, letting the brigades return separately at an early hour to-morrow.

J. M. DAVIES,

Colonel, Commanding.
