FORT POWHATAN, July 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEITZEL:

GENERAL: Is it expected at department headquarters that I will personally superintend details on engineer fatigue duty; or shall I as heretofore place such details under the superintendence of Lieutenant Baldwin? Am I held responsible for any insufficiency of his superintendence?

G. S. INNIS,

Colonel, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA, In the Field,July 26, 1864-10 a.m.

Colonel INNIS,

Fort Powhatan:

Your dispatch received. Assist the engineers as much as possible and get that work done.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.

FORT POWHATAN, VA., July 26, 1864.

(Received 8.40 p.m.)

General WEITZEL:

GENERAL: I consider Lieutenant Baldwin a very inefficient officer. He sometimes keeps fatigue details waiting from half to one and a half hours before he gets ready to get them to work. One-half the men under proper management could turn off more work.

G. S. INNIS,

Colonel, Commanding.

JULY 26, 1864.

Colonel INNIS,

Fort Powhatan:

It is only expected that you furnish all details asks for with promptitude. You are not responsible for his inefficiency. If you think he is inefficient it is your duty to report him to these headquarters at once. I can send a better officer, but do not care to make the change just now.

G. WEITZEL,

Brigadier-General and Acting Chief of Staff.
