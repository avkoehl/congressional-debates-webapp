APPENDIX TO THE! CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July, 1841.
27"tii C«nG'"-1st hail .
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Woodbury.
Senate.
ates that will be connected with it I propose,
therefore, in the first instance, to strike ou the
whole capital, and thus relieve the <hairman *nd
the rest of us from the perplexities of guarding
safely any thing but the pubUc deposites. This
will be a vital remedy It will strike auhe
root of the difficulty, because it will leave notning
to arrange bat a mere fiscal agent and the safety
of the current revenue Nor will it, if success-
ful, lessen our control over tbi corporation
If it have no capital, the supervision of it in
all respects will doubtless be retained by the Go-
vernment, as it should be, to insure certainty,
accountability, and safety, as well as punctuatny
in the agency for all our financial operanon We
otherwise would cease, in this important function,
to be an independent and self-tffiuent Govern-
ment
But if some private capital is restored to the bill,
it is easy stilt to supervise and c^eck this, fis-
cal machinery, by way of «orne tuectors, ac-
countability, and even a bonus, if we choose to
make such requirements We may well exact all
these, for the privilege of using the public depo
sites, and for the privilege of leiling their nfc-tes, if
any, be taken for public dues. It is not a
question, therefore, as to details comparatively
unimportant, but one radical, and ex ending to the
merits of the whole system
It seems to be determined that we are to have
a bank of some kind or other The question then
arises, if i* be not safer and more constitutional to
have une with no greater powers than are necessa-
ry and proper to ducharte the public business,
which is with no capital, or a comparatively small
one, rather than to have an agent with private as
well as public capital, and to have one commer-
cial as well as fiscal in its structure and func-
tions.
It has already been decided to locate this Bank
in the city ot Washington, and to censtitute it an
arm of the Treasury It is not, then, more ap
propnate to have its operations corfin d to mere
public matters oí a fiscal nature—to the collection,
keeping, iian^ferrirv, and disbursing ol the public
money—than to extend ihem unnecessarily to pri-
vate loai s, to mercantile exchang(.s, and t > all
the various ramifications of commercial banking,
scattered ovrr the whole Union? Consequent y,
should a majority of the Senate vote to strike out
the present cipnal, as is to be hoped, the next step
might be this The same majority, or a different
one, will be asked to decide that no discounts, and
probably no paper issues for cucuiatioa shall
be connscted wit the fiscal agent (n that event,
the blank would lint be tilled at all, ami thesubse
quent portions oí the bill w< uld be so modified as-
to make the bank merely one for public dep( sues
It would thus resemble the inainal form of all
modern banking, by being confined to deposites
alone. But should ihe Senate think some capital,
either public or private, was constitutional and
expedient, th blank could be filltd with such
smaller  um as might appear more safe It might
also be whel y public capital or who y pnvat
capital, or mixed, as sho.dd, on moit lull consi-
deraiu n, be deemed s, lutaiy
In coming to a final conclusion on htse points,
we should avail ourselves ot  al  the I g its ol expr
nence and rcisonmg    Instead oti.ig.ing behm 1
the age in . Hj importint topes ccnuected wnh
banking, we could   benefit by íl e  wh He, and if
we have omitt d the  wise course  pi,isued else
where, to summon experienced merit ants lor m
formation practical  ba )Ws, and    ci ntific rea-
oners, we could still,    n ^ome of  then  piiDlished
remark?, use them as  wimo es the   mosi valua
ble       We   could   •■how by   the  Gil aims,  th
Appletons,   ihe    Raguets,    the    L-mnde es,   the
Gastons,   and   the   Hopkinsons,    ihat   the   pie-
sent capital oí th rty   to   fitly  mil i m% was t
high   for  any   iegiin^te object,   „nel we couh
p ove by the C ays and o her i ppo it   u S na   r¿
in this hall, in large numbers, in otnei days,  tb<u
a  National Bank \ nh   any  opital ft r discount
was not only uneonstilutioial, but v u 'd become,
if organized like «hi--, one of the g ci test curse
ever irflicted on the human race     fins s,ysiemoI
lending  out ihe public revenue  h?s  been  most
harshly denounced even in our own da/
Have not the supporters of tbi very b 11
censured m 1833, and s nee, the loans
of Ihe public money by the selected State
banks'! Has the practice not been stigmr-tized by
them as leading to political favoritism, to excessive
issues of paper, to overtrading? And have not the
calamitous revulsions of 1837 been often ascribed
by our opponents chiefly to that cause?
Yet now we are deliberately called on by them
to vote for a Bank, designed to loan out not only
the publ c deposites, but from ten to sixteen mil
lions more of public capital, borrowed and placed
m this Bank for that express purpose
These immense sums are to be loaded also, not
merely to merchants for aid in paying duties, but
to any and every body, except members of Con
grc-s and directors—indeed, to all Executive
officers and the army of civil tfficers—in all
amounts They may, by the vote this morn-
ing on the subject of donations, be, for
aught interdicted by us, even given away, for
the basest ends, to any body except the officers of
the Bank.
What an alarming departure h this from the
prudent piovisions of the Independent Treasury
which made it penal to loan out a1 all a dollar of
the public money ' Even Ihe bill repealing that
system, which has passed the Senate within a few
weeks, makes it felony in any officer "to loan, with
or without interest, any portion of the public mo
neys intrusted to him " But by the present measure
we piovide millions on millions to be loaned out,
and if the managers of the Bank think proper, for
the advancement of any sinister or political object
to be gmen away with perfect impunity What
glorious visi ns must thus be in prospect for those
who have sighed «o long to enter the promi ed
land, and partition among themselves and friends
not only all the odious spoils of office but all the in
cidental favors connected with power!
A fiscal agency through this Banlr, if the thirty
millions of e ¡pita! ts retained, will cost us at least,
in the first instance, the linerest < n the sixteen mil-
lions which we must boirow lofcrmour patt of
the capital That interest, at five percent, only,
would be eight hundred thousand dollars annually
But the whole expense of the much abused Inde-
pendent Treasury annually has not been sixty
thousand dollar--—not one-thirteenth as much
Let it not be sai I that the Government is likely
to obtain large dividends and reserved profits on
this capital
When the first National Bank existed, and the
capital of the S ate banks was small, and the ma
nagers lc>s corrupt and ventuiesome than since, a
fa r dividend accrued But under the second Na
tional Bink no dividends whatever were received
lor one oi iwo year , small ones only during other
years And the capital it elf, retained by the ol I
stncl hold r-, in tr e new State charter, has been
lost.t least to one half, if not two-thirds of us
whole amount
Snould the Bank ro m'o operation, located here
u d r political ausp eet and likely to be wielded
to advance poliU„ I objei ts, and open to all the
i^ks which its imp rlect restrictions expo e
it to, no ¿reat skill is required to predict,
with much certainty, ha , if w-evirg. t back our
onginalupila1 aid no divid nds wha ever, it will
proie to be a pieei of singula! gocd lormne

But I adu t t at there is a ta r, Jcgttima'e, in I
safe pabh" object to be a'tained by i> is bill, it the
cap tal be str eken t ut That object is to fe-orga-
n re the Treasury D parlmer t, m re pect to a part
of its fiscal machinery. It i  to change, in some
re<pecu, tie present mod-? if collectng, keeping,
and disbursing the public funds.
That is a commendable design, ¡f public conve-
nience requires a change But if we came here
mere y on the «ensele & cry of mad dig against the
Independent Treasury, and undertake to repeal it,
and tstablish a different agency less ^afe and less
salutary, we act at least unwisely.
But should we go further, and successfully at-
tempt to subs itute for the present agency on<± not
con titutional, or, if constitutional, not expedient
on any great, broad, public grounds, but rather
dangerous to the pecuniary interests of the com-
munity, and hazardous to public liberty, the coun-
try will for ages rue the day when this extraordi-
nary session of Congress was convened
I admit, however, that we have constitutional
authority to create a Fiscal agency. It is derived
from the power to lay and collect taxes, pay debts,
and maintain an army and navy To accomplish
these objects, there must be a Treasury, and offi-
cers of some kind But this constitutes the whole
skeleton of the agency It should relate to fiseal
matiers alone—as the title of the present bill does
decep musly, while its contents ar<- intended for
commercial objects beside It should not be for
private -nterprises and gain, as well as public, like
the present bill, but be limited to the business of
the United States alone as a Government.
My motion to strike out the whole capital is
therefore grounded, first, on an opinion that the
lending of capital does not properly belong to the
Treasury or to fiscal matter", and much la's does
the lending of private funds or private subscriptions
belong to the Treasury Department, as a portion of
its legitimate, natural, and appropriate dunes
For the Government, as a Government, to seek
to enter into such enterpn es in organizing its fiscal
machinery, and to do this through the incorpora-
tion of a banking institution, is, in my opinion,
clearly both unconstitutional and inexpedient
If the Fi'cal agency now proposed had been
limited to the employment of individuals, instead
of the creation and use of a corpoiation as a part
and parcel of the Tre,-"-ury Department, it would
have been in analogy to the s^s em of tperations
in all the other departments, and attended with
very few difficulties.
As the War Department employs individual offi-
cers and soldiers to carry on us operations, the
navy, individual officers and seamen, ihe State
Department, individual consuls and ambassadors,
the law department, (if I may be a'lowed the ex-
pression,) individual attorneys andjudge^, so might
the Treasury appropriately employ individual col-
lectors, rec«iveis, and treasurers
But who ever heard of introducing into the oiga-
mzation of the War Depar ment a corporation to
fight?—or of the State Department, a corporation
to negotiate? or a cirporation to transact our law
business? We migh as well have a corporation
to legislate for u*, and ihen, in truth, a corporation
to manage the Treasury concerns would not be
such an anomaly, however, in some respects, ridi-
culous.
We should then imitate some cases in the com-
munity, here and abroad, where corporations are
m 'uch favor, and employed in sueh abundance as
to prevail even for washing clothes and for burying
the d=ad
Again ail the horror which existed a few years
aso with our opponents at the Government merely
«vesting if «urplus fund- in State or other stocks,
(oteare it « ould look like d-aling as a broker or
banker,) =eems to have vaiished, as if by magic
And we aie now not only to we a corporation,
but to enier m o the pal y joint-stock partnership
with every Saylock who chooses to become a sub-
scriber, in all ihe lending, borromn?, and traffick-
ing in money and exel auges which belong to the
smallest village bank among the nine hundred
scattered 0Vv.r the wide surface of die United
States
We thus make ihe Governm nt become a Jew
dealer, with the hope of gam Ii is to descend
from its dignified and publr posit in as a regula-
tor and governor of others, to become a participa-
tor in private life m moneyed speculations, ard
which practice might with equ?l propriety, on
prmcipie, he exfende 1 to a copar tnersh p in tan-
ning leather, picking oakum, or buying and sell-
ing old clothes.   Nothing is well and profitably
