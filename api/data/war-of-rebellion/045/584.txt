CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 7, 1863.

The commanding general has received information, deemed reliable, that the enemy has not yet recrossed the river in any considerable force.

He therefore desires that corps commanders keep the troops well in hand, and prepared to move to the South Mountain Pass at a moment's notice.

By command of Major-General Meade:

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

NEWMAN'S GAP, July 7, 1863-2. 30 a. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:

The order brought by Lieutenant King is received, and will be obeyed immediately. Two officers of the First Corps, who left the enemy last night near Waynesborough, have reached me, and report the enemy in rapid retreat, and nearly out of artillery ammunition.

They also report that the rebels said D. H. Hill and Beauregard were both on the other side of the Potomac, with heavy re-enforcements.

I had thought of going on to the next gap to-morrow, if I go no orders, but shall begin the march to Gettysburg in the morning. Yesterday my command was re-enforced by about 2, 500 men.

Very respectfully,

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD BRIGADE, Caledonia Iron-Works, July 7, 1863-4 a. m.

Lieutenant Colonel A. J. ALEXANDER,A. A. G., Cavalry Corps:

My advance came up with the enemy's rear at 7 p. m. last night. My horses were too much broken down to push him. I think his train is stuck in the mud between this and Greencastle. Will follow him up this morning, and engage him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. IRVIN GREGG.
