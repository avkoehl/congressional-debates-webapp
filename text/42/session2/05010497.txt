granted to him until he asked for it it never
would have been granted, and the Senator
from Nevada spoke of that as a defiant re-
mark. He spoke of that as a remark which
showed that the Senator from Mississippi had
no gratitude for amnesty granted. He spoke
of it as a scornful remark. The truth of the
matter is, that the spirit of that remark, as I
think every other Senator than the Senator
lrom Nevada appreciated it, was one that did
the highest honor to the Senator from Missis-
sippi. What was he speaking of, and what did
he mean by saying that if he had not been
amnestied until he asked for it ho would be
without amnesty yet? Why this, which he ex-
plained, that in his judgment a man who had
been a leader in the rebellion oughtto stand with
the rest of those who were in it, upon the same
platform, and not get any advantage; that the
same fate which was meted out to them should
be meted out to him, and that no special excep-
tion ought to be made in his favor. What the
Senator from Mississippi was contending for
was in fact this: that no special amnesty bills
ought to have been passed at all, but that there
ought to have been one general amnesty for
all, or else no amnesty for any, and that what
lie would have been willing to do was to stand
with the rest of his countrymen ; if they were
amnestied, he to be amnestied ; if they remained
disfranchised, he to remain disfranchised. In
other words, he would seek no better fate for
himself than for the soldiers who had followed
him in the battle-field; and there was not a
man but the Senator from Nevada who heard
that remark who did not honor him for the
sentiment.
Mr. President, I have nothing more to say
on this subject.
Mr. EDMUNDS. May I ask the Senator
from Ohio a question just there ?
Mr. THURMAN. Certainly.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I ask the Senator whether
in his opinion there are not degrees of guilt in
treason against the Government which would
justify granting amnesty to one person on a
particular occasion and not to another?
Mr. THURMAN. I think there are.
Mr. EDMUNDS. Very well; then what
becomes of the argument about the Senator
from Mississippi ?
Mr. THUIIMAN. This becomes of the
argument, that that Senator may have felt that
he was not of those categories that ought to be
more favorably dealt with than others ; and if
I had been, as he was, I believe, a general in
the confederate service, I would tell you as he
did, that until you amnestied my soldiers you
would not have amnestied me.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of executive business.
Mr. RICE. I move that the Senate do now
adjourn.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The Sena-
tor from Arkansas moves that the Senate do
now adjourn.
The motion was agreed to; and (at four
o'clock and thirty-two minutes p. m.) the
Senate adjourned.
