Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Ruyner.
H. of Reps.
an effective armament Every tyro in naval or
military affairs talks about steam ships, steam bat-
teries, La Paixhan guns, (sixty pounders,) and shell
shot, and one not used to the gasconading style of
debate here would sometimes think Washington
city was invaded, and that a foreign steamer was
p'aymg bombs on the Capitol itself
Mr Chairman, it must be confessed that these
great interest have been most shamefully neglected
Wo have had, heretofore, the means to carry on a
proper sysiem of national defence, and C ingress,
with a few excep'ioas, has made liberal provision.
Those entrus'ed with the superintendence of the
military departments have been wanting m know-
ledge or disposition to make them efficient Look,
for instance, at the enormous sum appropriated by
Congress for this purpose, which ha>> been returned
to the surplus fund in the Treasury, because those
entrusted with its management would not do their
duty But adopt your distribuí on scheme, with an
empty Treasury, and yoa may have the will to
build up your navy and to perfect your fortifica-
tions, but, sir, you will lack an important ingredient
—the means.—unless yoa incur a great national
debt, like England, to scourge our people, and grind
the laboring man to the dust. Pass the distribution
law, and one of two things you must do, if you
desire to keep the navy even on its present footing,
and all admit the imperious necessity for enlarging
it, you must incur a debt, or create an enormous
tariff, and from the day that the destiny of the navy
is connected with either of these measures may be
dated its imp ndwg destruction Our relations
with England are of a threatening character No
man can predict vihen the war trumpet of this
great power may not be sounded on our coast, and
yet, m the face of this serious danger, with an
empty Treasury, a disordered currency, a crippled
navy, unfinished fortifications, without fonndnes
for cannon, without material1! of war and for ship",
for gentlemen to risa m taeir places and propose to
rob the Treasury of millions, to be scattered among
the States, seems to me u'terly irreconcilable with
the dictates of common sense, and the just de-
mands of the country Bat what do we see1 Why,
my colleague the o her day had given his views on
these great measure , Lad simply avowed his opi-
nion";, when two gentlemen rose and expressed
their suspicions (hat he was about to quit the Whig
party. Sir, things have come to a pretty pass if we
are to be proscribed or suspected for advocating
opinions that for years we have openly entertained
Mr. Jenifer here made an explanation to the
effect that he had said noimng about Mr Wise be-
ing about to desert hi? party.
Mr Wise asked whether the gentleman from
Maryland had any distrust cf him
Mr Jenifer made some reply which could not
be heard
Mr Wisf Well, then, I suppose the gentle-
men takes it for granted that the party will go with
him, when, at the same ume, •who knows what tne
measur s of General Harrison will be' Were
there not some gentlemen makmg principie-^ for
General Hainson before he came into po er'
But when it was not known what the principles of
the coming Administration would be, how < ould it
be aaid that he was about to desert hi  party'! He
(Mr W ) did not take the gentleman from Mary-
land as the Administration
After some further explanat ons tetween himself
and Mr Tenifer,
Mr Wise observed that, had it not teen for
other gentlemen expressing their views, what they
would do, &c he would never have sail a word
But, as every member on the floor who had pre-
viously spoken had given his viewo in relation to
the coming Administration, he thought it was as
fair for one as for another. And as others had ad-
ministered their little nostrums for the cure of the
disease, he, although not a regalar physician,
thought he wou^d do so too
Mr Mallort then resumed his remarks, and
observed that, at the very outsn, befere he had
spoken a moment, he had been taunted by tne gen-
tleman from Maryland with not being one of 'he
party I repeat, sir, (said Mr. M ) that the ho-
norable member from Maryland shall not un-
church me  I worked as hard in the late canvass
20
as he did, and I come here to sustain the Adminis-
tration of General Harrison m alt good faith, and
will do so as long as he acts on the principles
which brought him into power The gentleman,
too, from the cuy of Now York, [Mr Monroe,]
who entertain d the committee a few days since
with a disquisition on common schools, had twitted
us with our abstractions—-"Virginia abstractions"
was the burden of hit. song Sir, I will tell those gen-
tlemen that Old Virginia cannot boast of as many
common schools as New York, but she has, per-
haps, as much common sense Had the gentle-
men witnessed the exhibition m this hall a few
mornings since, of certain pupils fiom the State in-
stitution at Lexington, they would have perceived
that our people were isot altogether ignorant of the
science of signs. Sir, we understand the signs
given out by other-., and it is on the faith of these
signs, as well as words that we sre acting I have
said that we have common sense, if we do no<
abound in common schools, though of thes,e we
have a few, and I am happy to say they are fast
increasing Perhaps  the gentleman [Mr Monroe]
has never hear of a common school case that oc-
curred in the common school S ale of New York,
where his common school peoplea in 'he plentitude
of their practical wisdom and hard sense, were
guilty of an ' ab traction" that far surpasses any
hair splitting ever done m the Old Dominion
The case wat this a bridge connected with a rail
road line leading to the great city of the Empire
Sta e, in consequence of some eiror m the architec
tural skill of these common school gentry, gave
way with a tremendous crash, and the connection
between the ends of the railroad was kept up after-
wards by a steamboat These common school
gentlemen, however, with their usuil industry, set
themselves to work to repair the bridge, and in a
few weeks tiling* were all straight again The
steamer, being no longer required, wa ordered
round hona'', but, m attempting to pass down tne
river, it was discovered that she could noi ge' un-
der the bridge, it never having before occurred to
the manager  lint they c uld all the time nave run
the boat as well be'ow the bridge as abo\e if, or
entered into their calculations to compare t le
height of the boat with the space under the bridge
The steamer was finally sold f ir a mere s >ng, and,
before she was released from confinement, was
stripped to her naked timber [A member at die
Reporter's elbow suggested that it was simuu to
the mason who built his leg in a chimney ]
But the memoc from New York was not the
only one who had talked of our ' abstractions "
The gentleman from North Carolina [Mr Raíner]
did not spare us Mr Chairman, wlvn an indivi-
dual here from the South joins in this hue aid cry
about Virginia principles—aboliAC'ions, is iiey
are pleased to cull them—I always set it down as
asure sign that he has turned Feder¡>li>t Nov,
sir, if to oppose a high tauff, inte nal improve-
ments, a sp'en Ud and extravagant Government,
and ail in connection witi this beggarly distribu-
tion, 1-. an abstraction, tnen, fe one, I glory in be-
ing a Virginia ab trie'iomst The honorable mem-
ber, too, indulg A in some mvid ous compan ons
between North Carolina and Virginia, and spokf
of our "former glory," aid our present "^haroe '
I have not, sir, a single term oi reproa*>h, not an
u kind word, or a narsh epithet, to apply towards
his State Between his constituents and mine the
best feelings and relations exist We live ■= de oy
side, and wt trade together We are almost one
and the same people, divided only by an artifioial
line of latitude, na'ure having placed no barrier be-
tween us I gbned, moreover, in the gallant s and
which his State assumed m the late contest, and
rejoiced as nwch pt her victory as J mourned over
our own defeat. Bu' if that victory is to be used
against the Republican cause, the*!, Mr Chair
man, give me my good old mother, with all her
"abstractions,'* her constitutional prudery, it jou
please, even in the d clme of her greitne s and re
nown Give me, I sty, fV Old Dominion in pre-
ference to b'ushmg Nortn Carolina, ¿n the act of
prostituting herself to tie genius of Federal consoli-
dation
The honorable  member from Sou h Carolina,
LMr Thompson,] m the course of his eioqutnt re-
marks the o her day—for that gentleman is always
eloquent—Hiked somewhat about certain "star-
gazing politicians" "butting their heads against
the lamp posts " But let me tell the gentleman
there are more sorts of star gazing than one la
admiring the horizon, illuminated by the brilliant
rays of the rising sun of Power, it would be as well
occasionally to view the quarter whence comes the
storm In our eagerness to relieve the President
elect from all embarrassment, we should not forget
the interests of those who sent us here. We
should lot k, sir, to the humble cabin as well as to
the palace These movements will produce great
excitement in the South There is a storm ahead;
and when it bursts upon us, it will sweep from the
ocean many a gallant bark that now sails proudly
before the breeze
But, Mr Chairman, if those who entertain and
have expressed opinions opposite to those of my
colleague and m}self, are to succeed in putting the
ship of State on the Federal tack, I shall never re •
gret the course I pursued in supporting Gen Har-
rison If I am deceived as to the principles on
which he will administer the Government, his elec-
tion, if it accomplishes nothing else, will have the
effect of breaking down party trammels m the
South, and henceforward we shall meet, not on
men alone,but on the ground of principle In the
'ate contest, men of all creeds united together to
accomplish a common object Laying aside our
peculiar notions, we united in one mighty struggle
to rescue the Constitution from the Administration
which we thought endangered its safety, and
threatened not only the institutions, but the liber-
ties of the country We succeeded, and I am wil-
ling still to act together until the great work of re-
form is perfected But, while such is my desire,
I cannot remain uncorcerned when the impression
is sought lo be made, that my opinions will be m
conflict with Gener-1 Harrison's measures I
draw my coaclu ions- from his letter and speeches,
which I am prepared to show do not differ from the
principles avowed by my colleague and myself
If the question ag?in comes up, whether State
rights oi Feder.il doctrmesaieto shape fheadmims-
tra'ion of this Government, I am prepared for the
contest L"t the line be drawn as soon as gentle-
men please Doff our mme and uniform, and take
the field undpr your o vn banners Unmask your
batteries-, md we fear i ot the result Sir, I believe
not tho'e who tell us thit, m this contest, "our
Republican General Harrison" will be against the
Republican party, and will lead on our foes It
cannot be true—-it is not true.
Mr Chairman, m thus expressing my opinions,
I am actuated by no factious motives, and certain-
ly by no wi h to embarrass the next Administra-
tion, or produce di^cor t among our friends As a
citizen of this Republic, and as a representative of
the people,! have aright to speak freely of public
men an' their measures, and, come what may,
wmle I havi? a seat in this Hall, I shall continue to
exercise this privilege on all proper occasions
Conscious that, in what has been said, I have en-
deavored to discharge my duty, I rely for support,
not on the approving smile of any manor set ol
mm here but on tne good sense, the justice, and
lib rabty of my constituents at home
