as it was by the enemy on the farther side. The difficult woods through which General Humphreys' troops had to move prevented his left getting up to join with my right.

General Crawford's troops, on the left of General Griffin's, mistook the direction given them, so that neither got up into position till after dark. A farther advance against the enemy could not be made that night, and it was believed we had accomplished what was expected by our instructions.

In different dispatches to General Meade the above facts were reported.

In a dispatch from General Webb, writen at 7 p. m., I had the gratification to find the following:

The major-general commanding directs me to congratulate you and General Griffin upon your success to-day.

I communicated a copy of this to General Griffin, who was eminently deserving praise.

During the night in entrenched a brigade and two batteries at J. Stround's, the most advanced position we had gained, and placed General Crawford's division on and facing west from the plank road, his left resting on Gravelly Run, the plank road bridge over it having been destroyed by the enemy. General Ayres was held in reserve and to picket here rear, a measure rendered necessary for the security of our position and trains, which latter might be attacked by the enemy's cavalry (Barringer's) that had been reported to have passed south of us.
