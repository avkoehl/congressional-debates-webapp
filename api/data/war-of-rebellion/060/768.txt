HDQRS. ARMY AND DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, N. C., March 29, 1864.

Brigadier General H. W. WESSELLS,

Commanding Plymouth, N. C.:

GENERAL: Deeming it highly important that Commander Flusser should have the 100-pounder and 9-inch gun, &amp;c., at the earliest moment, I send them on the steamer Eagle, which please send back, with the latest information.

Your communication has just been presented by Lieutenant Carpenter. The views therein expressed by you and Commander Flusser, U. S. Navy, fully accord with my own. The statement of James bears upon its face so many contradictions that I pronounced it unreliable at once, and am glad to find my judgment sustained by those high in authority and on the spot. It is such men who give information for pay to those who are hundreds of miles away, and who act accordingly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

P. S. --If you can send up reliable men I will at sight pay any reasonable amount that you deem proper.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, N. C., March 29, 1864.

Brigadier General EDWARD HARLAND,

Commanding Sub-district of the Pamlico, Washington, N. C.:

GENERAL: Everything indicates that New Berne and Plymouth will be attacked when the enemy is fully ready with his iron-clads. They expect to pass Plymouth on high water and get into the sounds with that which is to co-operate with this one at Kinston. In that event your post at Hatteras Inlet will be assailed, since it commands our communications.

A careful inspection ought to be made there, and your 100-pounder and heavy guns be so placed as to command the channels by which the iron-clad must approach. The iron-clad has moved down from Halifax and below Hamilton about the 18th. On the 24th the commander at Plymouth as well as Commander Flusser, U. S. Navy, were looking for an attack.

As no one can tell when and where the blow may fall, all must be ready for the emergency when it comes. Do you think long-range guns can affect Hill's Point from the opposite bank? What is the exact distance?

The slashing between Fort Jack and the river adds materially to your strength by enabling your flank works to cover that side of the river. Reports of forces at Greenville and in your immediate front are conflicting.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
