wrong, be done, or disaster be the fiist effect of right
measure-, evea of a called session, a ho of those
now contending for the authorship cf measures
would then contend for the authorship of the mis-
chief to the party &r the country? Who would as-
sume so boldly to be answerable to the bitter tlis
appointment of the people ' S r, that is the worst of
all popular feel ngs to contend with—th* disappoint-
ment of the people' You cannot reason "vith it-
must overthrow you, sir, if you incur and encoun
ler it. It wreaks vengeance, sir, as biting as it is
bitter, no matter whether it be just or u ijust The
Government, sir, is a mammoth concern, and should
move slowly in developi' g us measures—the deve-
lopment of measures should wait awhile the deve-
lopment of events Yoa should see whether the«e
bank-- can maintain their efforts to resume   You
should wai  and see how many of them will fail
You should wait until a restoration of confidence
revives trade, and credit, and currency If
you do nothing at a calle 1 session, there wiU be
disappointment It you do something, and distress
continues, as it likely will, there will be disappoint
ment. It you do nothing, or o-nethmg, good or
bad, and disaster, follow, you will be destroyed
Then you niuot, for a called session to be successful,
be certain—in re must be no doubt—you must be
certain to do the right thing, to adopt exactly tkenght
measure, whatever * be, which must be followed
immediately by the right and desirab'e effects, or you
will egregioUbly in' to satisfy the expectations for
relief How many chances there ate against you
the msuranc" tfiices mignt possibly solve
Some gentiemi n seem t > ippiehenil that, so far
from the pressure continuing relief will come of
itself. Tney dread that—such arc ihe mighty re-
sources of ihic cfuntiy, and the irrepressible ener-
gies of our pe pic—the national prosperity will re-
vive too soon foi them to b cimsneicd it-, authors,

ten should follow a oMled session' I tell you, sir,
you will have commuted suicide
But th se instincts, sir, a'one, are not what go
verns me 11 ipposition to a called session Sa, I
wish to avoid Ihe ¿gitaiion íftis y ar—first of the
tariff, secondly of the distribution bill, th rdly of the
bank
Sir, Ibis tsnol the tune for tne inli tariff minority
to take up the revision of llie tiriffcompiomise
If they take up that ques'ion how, they will do it
with all the od 's agai ist them They will do it at
the most inauspi<-iou= period to themselves, an 1 at
the moa iavor.'ble tune lor the pioteclive paity
There is a lie/ieienci/ of revenue trom the stoppage
ef trade. Wait lor commerce to come back, and
that deficiency vid be supplied Gentlemen will
not violate thv con prom se Oh no' they will not
violate the compiom se as Ihey understand u, yet
they can do all the mi chief 1 dreid within Ihe terms
of their comprehnsion' All sorts of projects have
airead) ft en gotten up to raise the dunes for reve
nue, and not one of th=m pietends to violate the
comprom  e '
Sir, I fp \r t h h ne will bs «eiz d on to raise the
tariff to supply d I ciency and the teuijf will be snz'd

tariff on any ameles i  protective which is not for
revenue
Sir, I yield to no man in. friendship to a properly
organized, properly located, and n ell-managed
national bank And as- a friend to that measure,
I inveigh especially against urgmg it piernaturely
and in the midst of pressure II you press it to >
eageny, too hastily, at the wrong time, j ou will
lose the question for twenty jears to come
Sir, I have no idea that either of these measures
shall be presented to a called ses-sion, and be
pushed tlnough m the hie h-ec hoc hurry of polm
cal jugglery    They all require time and reflection
My advice to the Whg party, th*n, is, to ad-
journ and go home. Let the present majority
leave us they please, let us go home Wait a lit-
tle—from March to Decembei is i short time—
and consult the people Let all the elect ons be
held, .tnd our full strength or full weakness be as
certained Let us especially submit to oui con-
s lluenls the question of distribution in its ww
lisht Heretoiore the question has been the issue
of distnbutmg a surplus Mr Clay's land b l',
which was pocketed by General Jackson, and
would have been passed by both Houses in «pite
of t! e veto, to is a biH to distribute a surplus, and the
bill itself provided, I believe, that there was to be
no distribution unless there was a surplus of at
least five millions. A surplus was then dreaded as
a corruption fund Again ihe deposite act of 1836
was a deposite of forty millions of surplus, and the
vtry policy of it was to take it away from the pet-
ty larceny of defaulters, and of a coirupt political
parly in power Now [here is no surplus, it is a
dfuiency in the Tieasury, and I am 1 r ubmilti g
thk new issue undei the sun to tl e pe p'e Whether
they are f-r distributing a deficiency among ihe
Stales'! No Sute Legislature yet has everpass,ei
risoluuons to dutrüu e a deficiency I know seveial
of th m have to distribute a surplus, but none— no,
not one—to distribute a deficiency ' No man in his
senses ever heard i f uuen a pioposition before
And, sir, "ihe ca' miy kok atthekug" I
have üvro I to say lo General Hamsoi himself,
and as I de ire olhurs to hear it I choose to say
it here. My heait's desire and prayer fir him is,
that he mil be Piesident himself, and that he Hill ful-
fil to the lettei I'm pledge which bound me to him
more than any thing else he overs id, to let no
mai know on whom he desvied his mtntle lo fall—
to have nothing to do wi'h appointing his succes-
sor—to leave that to the people themselves. I
would exhort him to be the President, not of a
party, but of the nation, and to see that every man
undei him, from his Cabinet down to the lowest
postrm-.ter, atterds to the iiisti ess if his office, and
not to politics I would suggest to him lhat the be t
mode of perpetuating the Whi.  strength flnd Whig
popularity it to make every officei lot k to the suc-
cess of hi¿ ad mmstration, instead of looking to Ihe
succession of anothei to the administiation—e¿pe-
i tally to allow no man under him to electioneer for
himself or against another for the succession And,
sir, how is he to he expected to act fi r himself, it
he is to be suddenly called ob to perform lhat con-
stitutional duty—the most l-npor ant h  will have
to discharge—to recommend to Congress such mea-
sures as he d ems proper? He his been absent from
the national aflans more than twenty years He
is unacquainted, personally, with the actual condi-
It n or things in this metrepol s of mi rule If he
a«ts, then, as soon as he comes here, he must act
from the infor nation of others, who are themselves
"new hands at the bellows, ' so ne of whom hive
never been m befire ?nd may never hi again
Will he b^ ncom sending h s evm m autre?, then,
oi the is? Is it the oljeci of the cal ed seesion to h«ve
the) eisures ojo'Rersp"lmtd upon the country as his?
No s r, ro lb «tech h m to lock thoroughly with
his own eves into tie cordi nn of Govern iept, to
•«uncj well the wncl, to see fu himself ui.,t
ouglt to be done in all the Departments, and then
to reroipmtcd his ownmeaswes If he will jook
into the Nwy Department, I am sure be will see
that we are m no condition, compared w th foreifn
powers, to give auuy the proceeds of the public lands
from an empty Treasury Suppose a ca'l be made
upon ihe new he ids, too, at a called session—who
would be. rea^v *o rvf ti}« information icmtei bv

Congress? No member of th  Cabinet could be
prepaied in three inon hs to give informa ion of the
condition of the Departments
Again The Adminis'rat on party—ihe Van Bu-
rén party—have been mc«-sanlly insisting upon
trying the Sub Treasury The fact is, that they
have found it «o impracticable since it passed, that
th y have not trud it themselves They have
never, to this day, complied with its provisions—
they cannot, if they would Now, ought not Gen.
Harrison to tiy it, to show i s utter írríp-acticabili-
ty, before he recommends its repeal' Ought he not
to understand fu ly its enormous defects, and to
make them apparent by an attempted application
of it to aclual use by Government' W 11 this not
be the best argument for its repeal' Will it not be
the best argument for the charter of another Na-
tional Bank when the Sub-Treasury shall have
proved a grand tailure, as well as the deposite
bans system' Is this demonstration not worth
makirg, and is the time from March to December
too long for uf
Again He ought not to act precipitately without
knowing his rn> i It is with politicians as with the
rhetorician—•

General Harrison is not personally acquainted
with but few men now on due public stage He
cannot, a thousand miles off, have guessed who are
fit for the offices, high and low. I wisn him, sir,
to know his men well befóte he takes their counsel
or gives them bis coni. lence, or acts on their ad-
vice When, then, he has seen for himself—sur-
veved al1—understood men and means, and the
condition ot linns about him—he will be pre-
pared to recommend an ! lo act first for the honor
and welfare or his country, and, last, for the glory
andsuccecsif the party which brojght him into
power
Sir, the Whig psny should not be intoxicated by
is success We snould do nothing in Ihe flushed
fteungs of victory Whom have we conquered?
Our own countrymen and fellow-citizens, who are
to be governed by the same laws, and who have
equal rights as ourselves, who differ with us as to
op n ons merely about men aud measures, and who
will, it we follow their bad examples of Govern
m n', conquer us m turn I do not know how other
gentlemen feel, but for myself, I must say that my
feelings tne day after tKe victory were very diffe-
rent from those cf th day before On the stump
of the canvass, J fjt and spoke and really thought
as if govrnmenl was a very easy task, that to be in
poier was all that was neces iry to reform the
evils of which we complaned, and to accomplish
the eotd and ¡i?tnotie fnds we dfsired Wh?n I
rtalw d the 'act that we were in, the next feeling
with roe was as I presume it was with every re-
flecting patnotic friendo! our cause—i deep and
humble conviction of our own finite wisdom, of
our own weakre «, and, it might be, fody, and a
solemn sen=e of the heavy responsibility which had
fallen on me and my political faends, and of the
dread obligations winch the country had devolved
upon us Before the election, it was easy to find
fault, since the election, and after the inaugura-
tion, it might be hard to redeem the many fruitful
prom ses we had fpvishly made during theciuvass
I feel, sir, tha the man who goes into the Presi-
dential chair, during the days of purification like
these, should go there as one shriven for the pne^t-
hord1 I am n t, ¡b"refore, for lushing forward
and grasping the sceptre ef po \er with an amb.-
tiouo avidity, and, wi h tne shout of victors, dash-
inp on without a pause to ex reme revolutions of
