Rivers with the intention of attacking a scouting party then out in that vicinity, Captain Greene, with forty men of his company, was sent to that point. I have the honor to inclose herewith Captain Greene's report of his operations during the remainder of the month. * He deserves much credit for the activity and energy displayed over a region of country new to him and hretofore deemed impassable for troops. The two Indians captured hy Captain Greene were, on their arrival at this camp, identified by citizens of the valley and others. They had been engaged in many depredations committed previously, and very recently had been with the Indians in open hostilities. They were both hung, by my direction, on the 16th instant, at this place. On the 9th instant Lieutenant Hackett, with thirty-five men of Company G, was sent out at the request of Lieutenant-Colonel Whipple, of the BAttalion of Mountaineers, to asist in attacking a party of Indians discovered by Lieutenant Geer, of the Mountaineers. The report of Lieutenant Hackett is inclosed. + On the 10th Lieutenant Taylor, with fifteen men of Company E, escorted a train with supplies to Captain Greene's command, returning on the 11th. On the 12th Captain Cook, with a detachment of his company, was out on a scout to the east of this camp, and on the 19th Lieutenant Hutton, of the same company, also as out in the same direction. Both reports re inclosed herewith. ++ Lieutenant Taylor was again sent on the 19th to escort the train to the camp of Captain Greene, returning on the 20th.

On the 22nd instant, in accordance with my instructions, I left this camp with Company G and the remainder of E for the purpose of making a trip down the Klamath among the Indians on that river who have heretofore been friendly toward the whites, but who had recently been accused of rednering some aid to the hostile band under the Hoopa chief, Seranaltin John. A detachment was left in charge of this camp under Lieutenant Hackett. I arrived on the same day at Martin's ranch, near the junction of the Trinity and Klamath Rivers, where Captain Greene was encamped. About retreat, Lieutenant Hempfield, of the Battalion of Mountaineers, came into my camp and reported that a prisoner under his charge had been shot a short distance from there. On the following morning I deemed it my duty to investigage the affair as far as possible. All the facts were reported to the colonel commanding the district in my letter of the 23rd instnat. The prisoner was avery old man, who had, perhaps, more influence over the hostiles than any other man, and his loss under the circumstances was much to be regretted. The deed has also had a very bad effect on the Indians disposed to be friendly, lessening their confidence if nothing more. Having been satisfied from information received that the hostiles under John were int he vicinity of n the Klamath, some twenty miles below its jucntion with the Trinity, and that they were in the habit of visiting that place in the night-time, I, on the 24th, directed Lieutenant Taylor with twenty men in canoes to go down the river, leaving some stores for my command at Young's house, and afterward to descend some distance below, conceal his boats, and retujrn on the opposite side of the river to a point directly opposite the house, there to remain until my arrival, all of which was performed without the knowledge of any of the Indians in the vicinity. Leaving Lieutenant Hutton in charge with forty men, I with eighty men of the two companies marched by land. On arriving within five miles of Young's after a very hard march of seventeen miles, I halted, my men and animals almost exhausted, for the purpose of allowing them to recover.
