HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Morganza, La., September 16, 1864.

Colonel E. J. DAVIS,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that you take a sufficient force of your command and move out to Bayou Latenache to ascertain the facts connected with the reported fight in that vicinity. If you find the enemy not in too great force engage him vigorously and capture or drive him over the Atchafalaya. Please direct the officer in command of the cavalry left in the camp to report at these headquarters immediately, as it is the design to send a force out on the Fordoche road.

Very respectfully,

B. WILSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., September 16, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY:

GENERAL: Reports of scouts, deserters, and citizens are still that Price and Shelby are going to Missouri. They scatter over the country and make a clean sweep of horses and supplies as they go. The expedition has been delayed for want of forage. There is none on the route for fifty or sixty miles. I sent an assistant quartermaster into Memphis especially to send forage. He wrote me that it would be sent immediately, but it does not arrive. No further news from Walker and Polignac. The wires to Pine Bluff have been down; they are just up. It is said that Price went by way of Batesville and Shelby by Jacksonport. Price had his pontoon with him; thirty-old wagons. I do not think he would carry that over a country almost destitute of forage. I think now it will be best for my troops to go to Jacksonport, whence they can move either up Black or White River. There is plenty of forage on the east of black River and very little anywhere else in the country. The cavalry horses from Memphis came here without shoes; they are just now shod. If the additional re-enforcements you spoke of could be sent up the Washita with supplies I believe we could easily take Shreveport. Would not a movement in that direction bring Price and Shelby back and cause the desertion of most of the Missouri men? A great many of their Arkansas men are said to be home on furlough.

F. STEELE,

Major-General.
