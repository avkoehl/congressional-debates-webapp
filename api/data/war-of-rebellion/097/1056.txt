U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

RICHMOND, May 1, 1865-4.10 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I think it would be well to send some staff officers and all your engineers ahead to determine your route and to rebuild bridges, so far as can be done advantageously. Railroad bridges should be repaired and planked over for crossing, and these should be kept in good order for Sherman's army, which will immediately follow yours to Alexandria. Ambulances and wagons for which you have animals should be taken with your army.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
