HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Loudon, Tenn., August 27, 1864-10.30 a. m.

Brigadier-General AMMEN,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge your dispatch by courier. My scouts report General Steedman at Athens, on his return to Chattanooga. He advanced some distance this side of Athens. I have sent him a dispatch by courier, telling him where the enemy is.

A dispatch from Major Reeves, which left Kingston at 4 o'clock last evening, reports that his outposts were attacked and driven in. He also reports the capture by the enemy of a lieutenant and 9 men out of a scout of twelve men who had been sent out to feel the enemy. A large fire in that vicinity last night indicates that the enemy occupy Kingston, although I hope for the best. I am expecting a courier every minute from the major.

I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

M. L. PATTERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

LOUDON, August 27, 1864.

Brigadier-General AMMEN:

Dispatch just received from Kinston says reliable information states Wheeler was crossing Emory River at Park's Ferry last night and this morning, said to be 2,500 strong. Major Reeves thinks they will attack him to-night or in the morning. I don't think Wheeler will attack at Kingston. Major Reeves asks re-enforcements. Shall I send them down; [how] many?

M. L. PATTERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, August 27, 1864.

Colonel PATTERSON,

Send courier to General Steedman and inform him of movements of the enemy. If necessary send to Charleston, so as to telegraph to him at Chattanooga. He will want to protect railroad toward Nashville.
