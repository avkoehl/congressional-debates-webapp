with three companies well acquainted with the country, from the Seventh, Eleventh, and Twelfth Virginia Cavalry. With these, and dismounted cavalry as sharpshooters, he rendered good service, inflicting, by a skillful ambuscade, heavy loss on a force of the enemy much his superior in numbers. He was directed to form close communication with Brigadier General Fitz Lee, at Sperryville, for information and succor in case of need. In this position Major Myers fully sustained his reputation, and has proven himself a good officer and faithful public servant. His report, and that of Colonel Funsten,* will give the details of their operations. Unfavorable weather and the condition of the roads made the first three days to Moorefield exceedingly arduous. A failure on the part of my brigade quartermaster to have supplies at Cootz's Store, as directed, entailed delay highly detrimental. It prevented our reaching the South Branch until a rise in the waters made a detour of 25 miles by Petersburg necessary, and this delay deprived us of the power of preventing the junction of General Mulligan with the other forces of the enemy. The ford at Petersburg was wide, deep, rough, and, from the strength of the current, exceedingly dangerous. When but a part of the Sixth Virginia Cavalry, the leading regiment, had crossed, 1 man and horse were downed and two others narrowly escaped. But for the timely assistance of Messrs. Hutton, Cunningham, and other citizens of Petersburg, and Private Aaron Welton, Company F, Seventh Virginia Cavalry, our loss must have been serious. The bravery and hardihood evinced by them on this occasion is worthy of the highest praise.

The conduct of the Rev. Mr. [Richard T.] Davis, chaplain of the Sixth Virginia Cavalry, was here conspicuously good. His example in courage and his abiding faith in Providence won the admiration of all.

The enemy having failed to make his appearance in the vicinity of Moorefield, and our subsequent movements to be successful requiring a celerity not attainable by infantry and artillery, it was deemed best to send these, under Lieutenant-Colonel [James R.] Herbert, as convoy to the wagon train on its way back to the Valley. He marched from Moorefield by way of Franklin, gathering up all the surplus bacon in his route. For particulars you are referred to his report.

It was my intention to have packed from the old fields on the South Branch forage for the horses while we were engaged in the destruction of the bridge and trestle-work near Rowlesburg, but the great scarcity of corn made it necessary to start with our sacks empty, and trust to chance.

The pass at Greenland, contrary to information received, was occupied by the enemy. The loss of time in turning this post might have endangered the success of the general plan, so I deemed it proper to attempt carrying the place by assault. The cavalry charge under Lieutenant-Colonel [Thomas] Marshall, Seventh Virginia Cavalry, failed to so completely surprise the enemy as to secure the log church and other building, into which a retreat was made. Colonel Dulany, in supporting this charge, had his horse killed, and was himself so severely wounded through the arm as to have to remain on the ground. This regiment had 3 men killed and 10 wounded, and suffered severely in horses. Enough passed to secure the rear of the position. The sharpshooters of this regiment secured the woods and hillside on the left. The Mounted Rifles of [Lieutenant Colonel V. A.] Witcher's battalion, under Captain [J.] Chapman, were dismounted and thrown to the right. They penetrated close to the buildings and secured the stone works erected by the
