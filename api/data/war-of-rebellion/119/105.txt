Major General A. E. BURNSIDE,

Commanding Department of the Ohio, Cincinnati, Ohio:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose herewith a roll of 124 paroled men now at Camp Chase, who were paroled during the month of May, singly or in small parties, without the necessary formality and delivering required by the seventh section of the cartel. Under recent orders and instructions, all paroles so given are null and void and the men so paroled should be ordered to their regiments without exchange. A number of them were paroled at Vicksburg, but if they were not delivered to a person authorized to receive them after due notice the paroles are not binding. For a time after the publication of General Orders, Numbers 49, irregular paroles were recognized, though forbidden by that order, and I have included in this list only those paroled after the 1st of May.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
