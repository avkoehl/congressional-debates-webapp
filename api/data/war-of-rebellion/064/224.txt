HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., June 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK, Saint Joseph, Mo.:

You have made a mistake in ordering Colonel Williams to organize the Enrolled Militia of the Eighth District. It should have been to assist General Douglass in organizing. I have telegraphed that modification to Colonel Williams. You must conform to existing orders and military organization, and, if entire companies cannot be found who are trustworthy, rolls must be made from the organizations, and the men will be ordered out as Provisional Enrolled Missouri Militia. You must be very discreet in regard to the secret matters confided to you. No such thing as was told Governor Hall exists. There is something wrong somewhere.

W. S. ROSECRANS,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI, Saint Louis, Mo., June 4, 1864.

General C. B. FISK, Saint Joseph, Mo.:

The two companies of Seventh Kansas must come on soon as possible. The regiment is ordered to the front and has left already.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI, Saint Joseph, Mo., June 4, 1864.

Captain E. J. CRANDALL, Brookfield, Mo.:

Can you start a good scout toward Keytesville, in Chariton County? I learn there was trouble there last night. Have you heard of any? Remember the rule, arrest 10 leading rebels for every Union man disturbed, and give the sympathizers to understand that the expense of this summer campaign comes off from them. If they don't want trouble, let them drive out their armed friends.

CLINTON B. FISK,Brigadier-General.

BROOKFIELD, MO., June 4, 1864.

General CLINTON B. FISK:

I can send a scout early in the morning toward Keytesville, and will give them proper instructions. I saw men from near Clark's, who was taken prisoner near Bucklin, and they say he did not know any of the party who took him. They did him no injury. A band, supposed to be bushwhackers, were to-day seen at Stocton. I was on train and got off and went back. I found they were our own men in disguise. They told me they had a little muss near Keytesville last night. Every one who saw them supposed them to be bushwhackers and thieves, and had I not known some of them I, too, should have thought the same. I have just received your orders by Lieutenant Billings. Business will commence.

E. J.[CRANDALL],

Captain.
