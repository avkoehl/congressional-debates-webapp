DUNCAN'S FALLS, VIA ZANESVILLE, July 23, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

Lieutenant-Colonel McFarland is pursuing the enemy, skirmishing with their rear. My mounted force are 11 miles from here; therefore I cannot aid Shackelford.

JULY 23, 1863.

Colonel LEMERT, Zanesville, Ohio:

Communicate with General Shackelford, at Eagleport, and furnish him with all the fresh horses possible, even at the expense of dismounting some of your own men, and say to him I want him to push the enemy closely. I have sent armed boats up the river to delay Morgan's crossing between Marietta and Wheeling, until Shackleford comes upon him, and finishes the good work he has begun. Render Shackelford every possible aid, and leave no possible aid, and leave no possible thing undone to obstruct the road in front of Morgan.

Major-General.

Major General W. T. H. BROOKS,

Pittsburgh, Pa.:

Morgan crossed the Muskingum, at Eagleport, this morning,with the remnant of his force, some 400 or 500 men. We will try to keep him from crossing the Ohio, between Marietta and Wheeling, by means of armed boats, and, if possible, will capture him as General Shackleford is in close pursuit. He may be driven above Wheeling, and attempt to cross between there and Steubenville, or even higher up. If you have any very light draught boats at Pittsburgh, upon which you can put some artillery and sharpshooters, and protect the river above Wheeling, it may be of great service in impeding his crossing, until Shackleford comes up on him.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, July 23, 1863.

Governor TOD, Columbus, Ohio:

I suppose you have heard that Morgan crossed at Eagleport before the force from Zanesville reached there. I hope they will be able to detain him till Shackleford gets up. Have ordered two or three light-draught boats, with artillery and sharpshooters, to patrol the river above Marietta, and have notified the people between Zanesville and Wheeling.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
