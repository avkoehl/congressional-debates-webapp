CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
§41
Me on the persons of the great and the nch as or-
naments, were to be free from duty; as also gold
and silver epauletts, articles worn only by the am-
bitions and the aspirants after honor and glory
These were to be free from duty, while the very
subwstence of the common soldier was subjected
to a tax. There were other items which he could
not avoid adverting to, and they w-re philosophi-
cal apparatus, instruments, books, charts, statuary,
marble busts, painting, drawings, engravings,
medals, and gems. All these were to be permitted
to be imported free of dmy—and this, too, at the
expense of the very stomachs of the people.
He (Mr. Allus) cou d not bring himsflf to
consent to exempt these things, while it was to oe
done at the expense of the tea and coffee, and the
salt, upon the poor man's table. No It was tar
more important, in his judgment, that the rude arts
of hie should be guarded and maintained—those
arts which mimstpr to the wants of men— *'ian thrt
the finer art>, which minister only to his ¡Measures,
should be protected He ^as in favor of extend-
ing aid and assistance to colleges and institutions
of learning, although he himself h\d never derived
any great benefit fiom such institutions, he would,
nevertheless, ebernh, animate, and encourage them
by every legitímale rrode within ihe power ot the
Government, whenever it could be done without
infringing upon the rights and interest* of the great
body of ihe peop'e. But let it be considered that
the number of those who availed themselves of the
advantages to be derived from these institutions
was comparatively small, it was not thee the
•poor man's children were to be found. These
¡h«gs, then, which he had rarned, were to be ad-
mitid free of duty, becau<e they were intended to
benefit Ihe sons ot the wialthy classes, who were
educated  n colleges.
If it were proposed to confer additional facili-
ties and encouragements upon the common school
system, there would be some sense in n; but in
this speciss of lesisl. tion the'e was neither sense
nor propriety.   The influent al portions of society
__the  great   and   over'bddowing corpoiaiiDns—
these, it appeared, weie the special objects 01 legis-
lative protection, at the expense of the great body
of the people. Was it not far race important that
the farmer—the patient, the industrious, and en-
during farmer and «¡echan c, should be able to
procure his tea, his coffee, and his salt—ay, and
even his darning needles, (aheded to by the Sena-
tor from Missouri yesterday,)— at a cheap rate,
thin that those articles vhich he hid nsmed,
which ministered to the pampeied palates ot ihe
rich—gems and ornaments, which addressed them-
selves to the eye and the far"\y—or even statuary
and philosophical spp-iatus. wh><-h were for thf
especial use of the rich—si oe>ld be ¿'lowid to
come in free of duU? Was it not more im-
portant that the foimer °hoaid be the object of
legislative protection thra the latter1 Was it not
more important that toe necessaries of hfe «hou'd
be relieved from tasatiofi, aod Hat the burden
should fall upon thoie things whica ministered to
the lighter passions of mankind1
The Senatoi from Kentucky, the other day, ad-
verted to the circumstance f-at our ancestors re-
fused to drink tea ard coffee Why did ihoy do
so? Because a high tax was placed upon them. And
now it was proposed to place upon, these articles ^
tax far heavier than that odious tax which led to
the Revolution, The Sena or fr -n Kentucky had
demanded whether the farmers ard the mrc->anrs
of this country would not oe as wi'Lng to abandon
the use of the^e articles, ií thev were too expensive
for their means, r> j our pa" >* < fo efathers The
question of the Seraior exc ed in his [ Ar Al-
ien's] mind very ser oes reuecdon- file ques-
tion itself imported t! at the pr«- 'oramant party in
this country, had broushtme ncticn toas disastrous
a condition as 't was at (He tune wb n ihe Revo-
lution took pi  c —when he pec pie wtie otHrd on
to dispense with trip uece <?nes of hie, to reli-vc
themselves from the burdens which the Whig par-
ty have brought upon them.
The object of his motion was to adm t salt du'y
free The average price upon that «rticle had
been, for the last ten years, about eight cents upon
}be bushel; at times rising to eighteen ceats, and
again falling to two and three quarters. It was
proposed by this bill tc impose a tax upon this
necassary of life, of one hundred percest.—trailing
the people pay a dollar to the Government
for every dollaiS worth of s«lt they buy, while
articles of luxmy were to b-- permitted to come in
tree oí du v. He would not detain the Sena'e
longer. There were other amendments to be
moved to tnisbill; but, as 11 was no part of his pur-
pose to occupy •h'" i'-ie of the cenate unneces-
sarily, he would ontent hi nself wita asking the
yeas and 1 a.\ s "ipon his motion
Mr EVANS did not me?n 'o reply to th  Sena-
tor; but he would a .k him where in this bill did he
find that g<-m«, which sparkle on the rich, ate
made free? He finds amor"" the free ameles,
caUnets of sppcime^s imported by h'erary or n-
corporíted societies; and mese arc the gems he
speaks of.
The cor trast wis drawn between the rich ail
the poor—aHudmg to those free ge-^s aj it they
were to be worn by the rich. He ?!so alluded to
sweetmeats imported for the nch. Where does he
find them in the bib? Green or npefru't, in bulk,
is the only thing of the kind, and not pre^rved
fruits, which are f pay duly The Sona or «ays,
Is it not right that angles of gieaf g'-nenl con-
sumption ought to be cheap? Certamij and iron
ought to be cheap, as well p, tea and coffee, for
every one uses it So it 1^ with salt. It would be
well if these th'ngs coul I be hai tor nothing But
where is revenue to be go ? Is it not certain tint
it must h  had? Wheir else, but from these ar i-
clr-s of general consumption, was revenue to be
got?
Mr. ALLEN erp'a>ned that he had roa'e no a'-
lusion0, except to the genio of cabinets, but for
whose benefit were they to be exempted from dm;?
Whose but that of the neh' And w wuh t'as ir^it

sa.d the price of sun-made salt had been declining
for twenty years p^st, and would come down to
the mere cost of gathering It up after made by tha

out to the Egean s"a, produce this salt, and
would be elad to exchange it tor our surplus pro-

of salt at the different periods m 1822 and 1838, in,
different countries, for the purpose oí exemplifying
the injustice of a tax whi h was the same on all

Mr. WOODBURY remarked that ha should not
have troub "A the tí-rate with any remarks on this
motion to maka salt free, but for the reference
and appeal which had j'tst been made to him.
Whatever had been his humble exertions on this
subject many years gone by, the business was now
in better hands. The Sena'ors from Ohio and
Missouu [Mess.s Allen and Benton] needed no
aid from him Bui, m the lapse of near a qaarter
Oi a century, the question m coutroveisy had some-
what changed Then, the struggle was to reduce
the duly, and he thanked God it had been reduced.
No /, the struggle was to resist an increase of the
on j¡ nnd, if possible, to carry out the whole de-
sict p-st en'eruic d—of making salt, before this
ti .ie, enure J fiee
Thp first ''a, ho ever opened bis lips m the Sen-

burden on the f<-FiiC s of toe counts, through the
