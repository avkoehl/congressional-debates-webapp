Mr PROFFIT hoped the gentleman would have an oppor-
tunity of being fully heard on this subject
Mr ADAMS said if it w^sthe intention of this Hou*e now at
once—[cries of "flow, now"]—to proceed to the decision of this
resolution he must submit Was it ever known that, to a man
on whom charges of this kind weie staited of a sudden, and to
tally unexpected, no time was to be allowt-d for hn defence? If
the ordinary course oí business in this House—the punting of
the resolution, and fixing the time foi its i-on si deration—was to
be done away wnh, and ihe House to be taken between wind and
water to decide this re&olutioo, he must submit He was m the
power of the Hoi se
The SPEAKER said that if the senllemia fiom Massachu-
setts [Mr Adams) dcsned further time, he himself, or a fnei d
for him, could of right submit a mot on to postpone the further
consideration of the subject
Mr EVERETT would merely sta e that the íesolutjon of the
gentleman fiom Kentucky ptesemed pr ibably, one of the most
important questions that had ever been offeied to the considera
tion oí the House He would say that if the doctr-neof theie
solution was caint-d out, it would pioduce aievoluuonby ft rce
mthiscountiy— peaceably if they can,foinbl> if the) mu&t1'
—not that the mte.iu m of dissolving this Union pievailed in the
Eastern states m any gieatei degiee tl an in other pcrtionsof
the Union Hut if no peaceable mode could a veil for the redie&s
of grievances that snouid become mtolei ible, then it nu&t be
done by foice
Did the gentkman contend that, undei the pnvnions ol the
Constitution, if eveiy bee ion of the count t y should be satisfied
that Government had failed to accomplish its objects the,e was
no mode uf producing this peacetbly, but that it must be done
by a revolution and blood1 That was the doctn e 01 thureso
lution 1 he Constitution contemplated any change, any alí*
ration, fiom the smallest to the greatest ptiftctpkbof this Go
vemmeot, and not only this, but provided for the future go
veinment, whenever the evils of its present form in the diffeient
sections of the Union should be past heaung He hoped we
should hive no f< i able revolution, if theie evei sh uld bo a
ciuse for a d ssoluuon of the Union, the remedy would be
found in the provision of the Cou3fituHf>n, and would be peace
able
It would be peifectl} co «petent ti the State? to ado it 11
amendment to the ontstttution, winch would change i in
evejy feature The people were om npotent as tothe efect ol
the change He looked on ihc íesolu ion with alaim It was
ai initiatory siep ti consequences which he harlly daied to
contempla'e
But he rose, in consequence of t te impoitance of tl e question
to the counti y and of the position in which th* frmtlemin
fiom Massachusetts w ib > tacecl totnuve that the re olutlon he
punted, and the postponement of this subject to ^one day tint

ture of a deadly vegetab'e poison, to be imposed by force on a
