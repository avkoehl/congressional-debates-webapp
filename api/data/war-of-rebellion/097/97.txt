Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington:

I have no present purpose of making a campaign with the forces in the Middle Department, but want them in the best possible condition for either offensive or defensive operations. If Lee should retreat south the surplus force under Hancock could be transferred to another field. If he should go to Lynchburg they will be required where they are. The Nineteenth Corps ought to be discontinued, or else all the new troops coming into the field added to it. We want here all the cavalry horses that can be delivered between now and next Wednesday. Direct all the cavalry horses to be sent to Canby that can be . His cavalry ought, however, to remount itself in the country where it is operating. Canby should be supplied from the West and by the Mississippi River.
