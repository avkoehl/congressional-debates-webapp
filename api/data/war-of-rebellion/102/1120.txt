OFFICE CHIEF COMMISSARY OF SUBSISTENCE,

TRANS-MISSISSIPPI DEPARTMENT,

Shreveport, La., June 7, 1865.

Captain S. S. ROCKWOOD,

Commissary of Subsistence, U. S. Army, Shreveport, La.:

CAPTAIN: In obedience to Your request, I inclose herewith a list* of officers and agents of the subsistence department, Trans-Mississippi Department, as shown by reports on file in this office; also list of stores on hand in the department as shown by reports received from March 31 to April 30, 1865. These reports represented, it is thought, four fifths of all the subsistence stores in the department. I will state for Your information that, while negotiations for the surrender of the department were pending, the depots, so far as head from, except Marshall and Shreveport, were rifled by the citizens and soldiers. I know of no instance where the officers in charge of stores did not use all means to protect the same.

Respectfully, Your obedient servant,

WM. H. THOMAS,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence, Provisional Army, C. S.
