operative only when the Secretary considered the
deposites as unsafe in the bank Then, sir, if the
Secretary has the right to remoce the deposites
for other íeasons than the belief that they are un-
safe, does not the main aigument which is urged J
against the act of the Secretary, fail entirely of
effect                                                                             I
Has there been no cause for the act of the Sec ]
retary' There had been abundant cause, and he
contended that the existence of adequate causes
have been conceded by the aigument used on the
other side The President had fulfilled the expect-
ations of the country, and we have strong evidence
on our tables that the voice of the people, fiom
Maine to Louisiana, concurs in the act Then
the President had been guilty of no usuipation of
authority, and of no wanton abuse of power But
is it true that he is desirous to retain the discretion
imposed upon him in the honest dischaige of his
duty? Is any individual desnous of enabling the
Secretary of theTreasuiy to íetain any control of
the subject' Not one From his humble station
in the Government, he had but little intercourse
with those to whose hands the administiation of
our affairs was confided, but he had never heard
any intimation from any one that the aiscietion
assumed by the Secretary should remain to him
He would ask gentlemen on the other side to go
with us in putting this question at rest But, sn,
it is said, that though it is desirable to change
the destination of the public deposites, and though
the country may desire to get rid of the Bank
of the United States, yet such is the present
condition of things, that it is impracticable We
are told that, owing to the peculiar organiza-
tion of the banking system, and the influence
which the Bank of the United States is capable
of exercising, and does exeicise, it is impossi
ble that the country can do without the agency
of the Bank of the United States We are told
that this bank is necessary to enable the people of
the country to receive the reward of then labor
We are told, in a word, that the enterprise and
industry of tne country are in the hands of this
institution How is this made manifest' They
say that the bank understands the interests of the
countiy so well, knows so well the places Where,
at particular seasons, capital is íequired, and has
such facilities through her blanches, that it is able
to shift its capital fiom one place to tinothei, to
meet the emeigencies of the business rommunity
Now, sir, carry out this argument If the bank
controls the enteipnse and industiy of the coun
try, it can also control the election of the country
*f it can force a rechaitei now, he would ask,
whether, if at some future day, when its (1 lends
and enemies came into conflict, it would not put
down its foes and uphold Us fnends' It could
control an election by the same means by which
it could contiol the wishes of the people and the
sentiments of this House at the present time
Is not the assumption on the part of thefiiends
of the bank at war with the hbei ties of the people'
If the existence of the bank is necessary to the
industry and enterprise of the country, then all is
lost Its power is without compass, and is already
extended beyond the control of the people But,
though doubtless the bank was anxious to acquire
the power attributed to it, it had not yet succeeded
in the attempt He thought its friends were mis-
taken in the belief that the enterpnseand industry
of the country were dependantupon it He would
ask the sugar-planter of Louisiana in what manner
he was paid for lin produce Nine-tenths of the
sugar of Louisiana was paid foi in money of the
local banks The cotton groweis of Mississippi
will tell you that for nine tenths of their cotton
they were paid in notes of the loca' banks lie
would appeal to any one who was conversant with
the course of business in Alabama, to say whether
the sale of the cotton crops m that State depended
upon the bianch of the United States Bank at
¡Mobile Nine^enths of the money paid for cot-
ton ¡n Alabama was paid in local bank papei
One thing, he thought, was plain, that at what
ever point theie was a demand for capita!1, there
it would be brought, and he thought it would be
much better to leave the 'ransfer of capital to
individual sagacity and enterprise than to create
such a tremendous engine as the United States
Bank to do it
But, desnabie as it is to get rid of this institu-
tion, we are told that we cannot get nd of it We
are told that the country can establish no institu
tion which will supply the place of the bank Do
we contemplate, say they,a leagueof local banks'
No We carnot, then, it is said, make the local
banks perform all the operations squired from a
National bank It was said, too, that the power
which, to be efficient, must be confided to the con-
federated banks, would be as dangerous to the lib
erties of the people as a National bank No such
thing as a confederation of banks wis contended
for It was required from each bank o perform the
duties now peifoimed by the United States Bank,
and if each bank does us duty the duties will be as
efficiently pei formed by them as they can be by the
United States Bank. What was to prevent them
fiom transferring their funds from one part of the
countiy to anothei' Had they not the same facu-
lties' What had given the United States Bank the
universal credit and currency of its notes' Was
it not these two encumstances, that it was backed
by the Government deposites, and that Us notes
were receivable in payments to the Government
Suppose the same advantages to be extended to the
local deposite banks, in what would then facilities
fall short of those enjoyed by the United States
Bank' If the notes of the bianch bank at Mobile
were good in New Yoik, is it because the bai k is
more solvent or better managed than the State
bank of Alabama' If all the news he had heiid
were true, the preponderance was in favoi of the
State institution Each payb specie, why then is
the paper of the Bank of Alabama less cuirent
than that of the branch bank of Mobile' Simply
because the paper of the branch bank is receivable
in payment of the public revenue So the bianch
bank at Charleston and Savannah had a circula-
tion thioughout thecountiy But if tbebume facil
mes were extended by law to local banks in those
cities, m what i expect would the credit of their
note1* diffei from these of the bianch banks'
[Heie Mr M was compelled to suspend his
remaiks, without concluding, in consequence of
the expiration of the hour—the House having
refused to suspend the rule ]
The SPEAKER presented to the House a com
mumcation from the Secretaiy of the Treasury,
with  an account of contracts made in  1833 foi
light-houses, &c , which was laid on the table,
and ordered to be printed
The House went into Committee of the Whole
(Mr Cowoit in the chair) on sundry private
bills
A bill to compensateSusan Decatui and others,
whose claims have been so long before the House,
was taken up and consideied
Mr PITTON detaned the encumstances under
which Commodore Decatui performed the gallant
exploit—first projected by himself, and carried
into effect with a party of volunteers fiom the
squadion of Commodore Preble in the Mediter
ranean—to enter the harboi of Tripoli, in 1804,
where he succeeded in destroying the United States
fugate Philadelphia, which had been previously
cap'ured by that Power, and was lying at anchor,
protected by the batte-ies of the haiboi Having
eulogized the exploit as one that more than any
other had laised the character of theAmencap flag,
he advocated the claims of the persons engaged
in it and their representatives to the bounty of the
nation
[The bill grants §100,000, to be paid m the foi
lowing proportions
To the widow of Commodore Preble   $5 000 00
To Mrs Decatur, and the widows of
the officers in the first ch*s .            31,412 42
To the officers in the second class, their
equal proportions of.............1^2,56^ 96
To the officers of the third clas".....14 958 28
To the persons in the fouith class ... 12,215 93
To the persons in the fifth class......11,074 89
To the sixth class, corsisting of forty-
two seamen and marines........12,773 52]
Mi GRAYSON concurred in the views sub-
mitted by Mr P , and described in strong colors
the advantages that jesulted to the United States,
the Barbary Powers having been inspired with
such dread by tne gallantry of the exploit, that
they immediately sued for peace, and thus the
commerce of the country was protected fiom dep-
redations to which it had long been subjected
Mr CRANE thought the claims just, under
the circumstances upon which the vaiious pnze
acts had been usuahy passed, to reward the gal-
lantly of oui bearer, but he oljected to tha
mode of distribut on, and contei ded that it «hould
be mad" in conformity to that adopted in former
acts
Mr PARKER thought 'nat this claim was not
one of law, so much ¡>s it was of equity, and
whiJi, being founoed sole'y on an appeal to tl eir
honor and geneiosity, the House had theiefore
the n_ht to appomon the amount to be given, in
such a mannei as they should conceive the respec-
tive paiues had deserved it
Mr CHILI O IN said, 1 e had foi years opposed
these clbiins, ano he lelt still compelled to do so,
by a sense of what he felt due to his constituents,
and he knew that the late Commander Decatur,
if now alive, would not have presented any claim,
but would have been satisfied with what he valued
above all other things— he fame and distinction he
had acquned
On motion of Mr HAWES, the committee
rose, reported piogiess, and obtained leave to sit
again
The House suspended the rules to permit Mi
WHITTLESEY to submita motion, grafting the
use of the  Hall to  the Temperance Society, on
Tuesday evening next   Ayes 98, noes 19
Which motion having pi evaded—
Mr THOMAS, of I ouisiana, íemarked, that
as the natal diy of Wasiiingtov ought to be kept
by every patriot, he would ask a similar favor, for
the House to suspend its rules, to enable him to
submit a motion, that when the House should
adjourn, it shoukl adjourn over until Monday
The House suspended the rules foi that pur-
pose Ayes 114, noes 7, and the motion being
agieed to,
The House adjourned
The excitement in Upper Cnmdi against
the Provincial Assembly, for then arbitiary
course towards Mr.McKenzie, continues
to mciease, and the Assembly remains
obstínate. Since his last expulsion, on the
same ground of objection as the four pre-
ceding, every motion favoiable to his light
to a stat has been \oted down Some of
the people ol his district—the county of
Yoik—indignant at tin's pei sevenngexclu-
sion of their representative, have copied
some of the tempei of the English, on the
Relorm Question, and determined to pay
no taxes. This the} effect peacably, by
refining to ippoint a collector oi assessor
of taxes. In the township of King, at the
regular meeting of the 6ih ult , the detei-
rnimtion to refuse to appoint the taxing
officers wasuniverail One rmn dissented,
but he subsequently joined in an address
to Mi. McKenzie The matter, if followed
up in this «pint, must produce serious
consequences —Bait. American.
Specie —The packet ship Erie, daily
expected fiom Havre, h<t& on board a large
amount of specie,—how large, we cannot
ascertain, but the shipments were only
suspended by the íefusal of the under-
wiiter  in Havre, to insure any further
amount The balance was then sent on
board the Alban}, which ship was also
expected to have on board all that could
be insured.—JV*. Y. Jour. Com.
Famine prevails to such an extent in
the Ciimea, that two villages in the neigh-
borhood of Odessa, have been entirely
deserted by their inhabitants.
