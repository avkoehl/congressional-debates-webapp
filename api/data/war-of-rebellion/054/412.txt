TAZEWELL, December 10, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded.

Colonel Foster ordered his train to Blain's Cross-Roads; it probably contains ammunition. A train of rations is expected here at 9 o'clock this morning, and will be sent to Bean's Station without delay.

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Bean's Station, December 10, 1863-8.15 a.m.

GENERAL: I would have reported to you again last night, after receiving your orders, but for the fact that I had nothing of importance to communicate. I immediately forwarded, on the reception of your order, a messenger with communication for General Foster across the mountain. After my report of 12.30 o'clock yesterday, Colonel Ward had some skirmishing with the enemy on the Morristown road and drove him across the river. I have ordered this morning a brigade out upon the Rogersville road, and also one upon the Morristown road, and I will report immediately upon hearing from either. I regret that I did not send you a report last night, but I supposed that you did not expect one before this morning.

I am, general, yours, truly,

SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: I have just received report from Colonel Adams, commanding reconnaissance on Rogersville road. He had gone as far as Mooresburg, 3 miles this side of Red Bridge, when he came up with the enemy in considerable force guarding wagon train. He was then skirmishing with them. He represents that the enemy was dismounted and in a gorge, and that he would withdraw soon, as he could not dislodge him. Colonel Adams says that the last of the infantry left Mooresburg yesterday morning; that his cavalry encamped within 1 1/2 miles of the point at which they were skirmishing. His dispatch was sent at 2 p.m. No further news from reconnaissance on Morristown road since Major Cutting left.

I am, general, yours, &amp;c.,
