across the direct road from Rossville to Gordon's Mills to a road leading from Rossville to Reed's Bridge. Just at dark they made a terrific attack on Johnson's division and threw them into considerable confusion, and for that reason I should very much like to have [re-enforcements sent] up to support my left. The positions of the divisions are as follows: Brannan's right occupying the slopes of Mission Ridge, Reynolds next, Palmer next, Johnson next, and Baird on the left.

COMMANDING OFFICER FORCES ON THE LEFT,

Fourteenth Army Corps, Dept. of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my command is now occupying a line extending across the old Federal or Upper Ringgold road, extending to the Cleveland road on the left, and in the supposed direction of the left of the Fourteenth Army Corps, on the right, some half mile. I am some 3 miles from Rossville, on a small stream designated on our map as the West Chickamauga. I send an orderly to find your left. The enemy are in considerable force in my front this side of the Chickamauga River. I intend to attack them in the morning. Please give me such information as will be of interest in regard to the position of your left. A portion of my command was engaged this evening with a superior force of the enemy, much to the credit of my troops engaged.

I have the honor, &amp;c., respectfully, your obedient servant,
