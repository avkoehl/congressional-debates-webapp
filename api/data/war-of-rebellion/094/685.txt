HEADQUARTERS, Six Miles from Nashville, on Franklin Pike, December 13, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,Montgomery, Ala.:

Major Ayer, chief quartermaster, informs me that Major Bridewell, at Augusta, has fifty bales of blankets belonging to this army. Please have them sent forward at once in charge of some officer who will push them through. The weather is severe, the ground covered with snow, and the men stand much in need of them. If possible, order Major Bridewell also to send forward 10,000 suits of clothing and all the blankets that can be spared to this army.
