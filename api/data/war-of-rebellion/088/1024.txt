At 2 a. m. there was an attack made on the pickets on the Lee's Mill road by a dismounted party numbering twelve men, who came from the rear. I had two men wounded and lost one horse. Since then all has been quiet.

At daylight I sent a party of the First Maine Cavalry along the line of the Thirteenth Pennsylvania, with directions to make a thorough search for the party above mentioned. Have not yet heard from it.

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that you re-establish your picket-line, as it was two weeks, ago between the plank road and a point which will be designated by Major Taylor, as that at which connection will be made with the left of the line of the First Brigade. If the line from General Kautz's right to the point at which you will connect with the First Brigade can be established with 800 men do not employ more. Report to these headquarters the establishment of your new line.
