HEADQUARTERS,South Mills, N. C., August 12, 1863.

SIR: Your communications of the 10th and 11th were both received to-day. I shall send a patrol to communicate daily with Major Wheelan's pickets at the feeder.

I have destroyed all communication across the river at this point, and I am guarding it at the bridge and patrolling along the canal. Nothing can cross the river at this point. To prevent any communication across the river at this point, or near Camden Court-House, all the boats on the river should be destroyed.

When station here in May last, under command of Major Stratton, I destroyed all the boats on the river at or near Elizabeth City. Some, however, have since accumulated. They are hid up the small creeks and swamps, and it would require a boat party, strongly supported on each side of the river, to destroy all the boats, and thus prevent all communication. I have information from Elizabeth City; no United States troops are there.

I would respectfully suggest that the Dismal Swamp Canal Company be required to repair the canal. The boat loaded with supplies for my command that left Norfolk two days since, has not yet arrived, owing to the condition of the canal.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. DEWEES ROBERTS,

Captain, 11th Pa. Vol. Cav., Commanding South Mills, N. C.

Captain GEORGE H. JOHNSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
