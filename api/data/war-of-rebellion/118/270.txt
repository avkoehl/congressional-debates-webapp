OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., February 13, 1863.

Captain E. L. WEBBER,

Commanding Camp Chase Prison, Columbus, Ohio:

Send under a guard of an officer and ten men to report to the provost-marshal of this city all citizen prisoners who wish to be exchanged, including those recommended by Judge Galloway, excluding spies. Send to me rolls with charges and sentences in full. Notify me when they leave. Among those to be exchanged include all who are unwilling to take the oath of allegiance if permitted to do so, though they may not desire to be exchanged. Judge Galloway recommends that Lewis W. Luther, of Cabell County, Va., be released on taking the oath of allegiance. Governor Peirpoint recommends that he be sent South and you will therefore include him among those to be exchanged. Order 193 applies only to prisoners in confinement at its date. I will write you further in relation to it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

W. L. McDONALD,

Sutler of Twenty-sixth New Jersey Vols., Washington, D. C.

SIR: In reply to your application to me to effect an exchange between yourself and Mr. S. J. Anderson, now on parole in New York, I have to inform you that by an arrangement recently entered into between Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Ludlow, agent for the exchange of prisoners, and Robert Ould, esq., the agent from Richmond, all sutlers and their employees have been exchanged and it is therefore not necessary that a special exchange should be made in your case. But that there may be no doubt on the subject I will refer the matter to Colonel Ludlow, that your release from your parole may be fully acknowledged. Unless you hear further from me you may consider yourself exchanged.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

FORT MONROE, VA., February 13, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

I want 500 citizen prisoners for exchange.

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.
