THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 22.
'This is in pursuance of an estimate of the Com-
mittee on the Library.
Mr. PEA.RCE. I will explain to the Senate
that that appropriation was rendered necessary,
in great part, by the late lire. We were obliged
' to purchase a great many new books, the trans-
portation of which has cost a large sum of money.
On this account, and because of the incidental ex-
penses attending the transportation, this amend-
ment is necessary.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HUNTER. I now offer the last amend-
ment which I have in charge. It is to strike out
*20,650, in the appropriation for surveys in the
-mineral region of Michigan, and insert in place of
it $24,780. This is rendered necessary by a pie-
vious amendment, which the Senate has adopted,
raising the price of those surveys from five to six
dollars per mile, That amendment was reported
by the committee, and adopted by the Senate, on
the recommendation of the Department, and be- j
cause of that amendment, this alteration becomes j
necessary. ]
The amendment was agreed to. I
Mr. HAMLIN. 1 offer the following amend- j
ment: I
For the payment of James W. Hale, of the city of New
York, in fuli for discharging the duties of (h-p.itoh a'j^nt,
ffin September, 1849, to Juuu, 1830, lueluiive, the sum <>t
$600.
I desire to say, that I am directed by the Com-
mittee on the Post Office and Post Roach to oiler
this amendment, on the recommendation of the
Secretary of State, who has furnished m^ with an
estimate, winch 1 hold in my hand, and it can he
read, if required. The duties nf the office were
discharged by Mr. Hale, foi the rime mentioned
in the amendment, du mg the indisposition of
Matthew L. Davis.
The amendment w;<s agreed to.
Mr. STOCKTON. 1 desjie to ijive e to the
Senate that on Tuesday next, din nig tbu niniinii"
hour, I shall ask of it (he fuvor to j>t>i,nxl .i hill
that is on the table, for the construction of a war
steamer, to be taken up.
Mr. BORLAND. i have an amendment to
offer to the bill As this seems to be a sort of
omnibus, I suppose there will be no objection to
the amendment on the score of iirelevancy. The
amendment is to add—

I do not chmk this amendment will require much
explanation. Tiie onje^t of it obviously is to se-
cure a thorough i-uuh; ation, or a thorough distri-
bution of the pubhci'tion of the iavys passed by
Congress, among the different States and Territo-
ries. X think the number of newspapers to be
selected, according to the amendment, will be suf-
ficient for that purpose. The amendment wjii
secure the publication of the laws in a paper in
each Congressional district, in a paper having the
largest weekly circulation within that district, that
is, the circulation which throws the paper gener-
ally among the people of the country. It is not
necessary to publish the laws in the other editions
of the paper, because the publication once m the
weekly edition will be sufficient to carry them
before the readers of the paper. One paper in
each Congressional distiiet, one in each Territory,
and four in the Distiict of Columbia, 1 take to be
a suiKctent number.
With regard to the public advertisements, I did
not suppose that so many papers would be neces-
sary, and thetefore 1 have provided in the amend-
ment for their publication in the two papers in each
State of the largest circulation. The amendment
provides that here, at the seat of Government,
both tiie laws and tlie public advertisements shall
be published in the four papers having the largest
circulation.
The object of this amendment is, as I suppose
every one will perceive, to take out of the hands
j of any and every Administration the use of a kind
! of patronage, the tendency of which is to subsi-
j dize the newspaper press of the country, particu-
< iarly the small local pi ess scattered all over the
i country, which we know has a very considerable
; influence upon public, sentiment. I cannot be
| supposed to be actuated by any party consider*
i atiou.s in this matter, because whatever others may
, think, I do coi'seientiou.sly believe that the {"any
to whieh I belong will very .speedily be m power.
Air. HALK. "What pai'ty is that?
j IVI r. JJO ilL A. xS D. The great Demon at ic party
. of Ih{* nation, without division. f<'or that reason
■ i had no hesitation m offering this amendment. 1
! would bo unwilling to put myself in the attitude
j of offering a proposition, the sole effect oi wlueh
would be to throw obstacles m the way of, or
! take power fiom an Administration to which 1
was politically opposed. Tins provision is to he
prospective. J presume that veiy little effect wili
be produced by it during the few months that the
I present Administration will remam in power,
j At the suggestion of a Ser.ator, who wishes to
| look into the matter a little more closely, I will not
! press the adoption of this amendment now; but
1 as I suppose it can be printed by to-morrow morn-
■ mg, 1 move that it be printed for the use of the
! Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
! Mr. DADGKR. 1 wish to say, that 1 think the
geuei.11 purpose of this amend ment ts verv coj reet,
, but the derails of it, perhaps, require a little exam-
! ination; and I was about to suggest to the honor-
' able Senator from Arkansas, that he should por-
1 nut this amendment to lie over. I wish to say,
i al-;o, that as 1 do not concur in the opinion which
: he 1ms so confidently expressed, that the great
i Oemot ratio purty to which lie belongs is soon to
' be m power, and' as I am afraid thai this amend-
i ment ih looking forward to some very irregular
■ rt strletioos upon the succeeding Whig Adminis-
I fr;irii ii. l wish to have a very full opportunity for
; no examination, and therefore I move that the
do now adjourn.
, The mot.on was agreed to, nnd the Senate
■ ad:ourned.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Thuksdav, >/2pril 22, 1852. J
The fiouse met at twelve o'clock, m. Prayer '
by the Rev. C. M. ;
The Journal ofypsterday was read and approved, i
MILITARY RESERVATION IW ARKANSAS.
; The SPEAKER. The first business in order
is the consideration of House hi1] lSTo. 238, being
! aa act to release from reservation certain lands for 1
military purposes, m the State of Arkansas. Tiie
oue.<ioo peudms: is to recommit the bill.
Air. JOHNSON, of Arkansas. I will ask the
genth-man from Alissouri, [Air. Hall,] if he .
pleases, to state to the House the objects of this
bill. As 1 have looked at t!:e matter, however, 1 ,
v/iil also make a statement, and then give up the
floor, and let the House do with it what it pleases. '
; There are three propositions in this bill, wnich are >
distinct. One is to restore these lands, now re-
served from sale, to the mass of the public lands,
so that they may be subjected to sale, and entered
as any other lands. I ask for that, on thepart of
my State, because it operates oppressively not to
permit the public lands in Arkansas to be sold, as
any where else.
Another provision is, that where the land offices
have suffered these lands to be sold, or, in other
words,have sold portions of them,to thepeople of
Arkansas, m despite of the act of reservation, that
the titles and patents which have been issued
therefor by the Government of the United States
shall be confirmed and made valid—the Govern-
ment having received the money, and there being
nothing objeetionable in the matter, and the only
peculiarity being that they were among the mass
of reserved lamls, and were allowed to be entered
by the land officers through mistake.
Another proposition is, that those who have set-
tled upon these reserved lands in that State, and
made bona fide improvements, shall, upon paying
the Government price, be allowed the same privi-
lege of preemption which is granted in respect to
all other public lands of the United States.
These are the propos'tions. It is for the inter-
est of the Government that this bill should be
passed, it grants nothing to the State of Arkan-
sas. Under these circumstances, I ask that, as it
has now come to a final vote, it shall be permitted
to pa.^s. I will ask the gentleman from iVlissouri
[Mr. Hall] to explain the matter, if he pleases,
should there be anything different from what I
have stated.
Mr. ROBBINS. For what purpose were these
lands reserved ?
Mr. JOHNSOZnT. 1 wiil state the purpose for
which they were reserved. Gentlemen will recoi-
le --t, i hat justaftei the war of 1812, military bounty
lands were het apm t for the satisfaction of the mil-
itary land uarrao's provided to be allowed at that
tune. Amongst these tracts of country set apart,
wa;-; a lar^e tract of country in the then Territory of
Arkansas. Those warranis and claims, or very
nearly all, ha\e lone: s<nce been satisfied. That
was the reason of this reservation being made,
which ts no longer of any use.
Mr. HALL. I believe that the gentleman from
Arkansas [Mr. Johnson] describes the bill cor-
rectly; but, as the gentleman from jNorth Caro-
lina, [Mr. Stanly,] on yesterday suggested that
some of the warrants for the satisfaction of which
the lands in Arkansas were reserved might re-
main unsatisfied, and the holders of these war-
rants might, therefore, be deprived of some rights
which they already possessed under existing
laws, i will propose, for'the purpose of removing
that objection, to amend the bill by adding the
following; 
The SPEAKER. This can only be done by
unanimous consent.
There being no objection, the amendment was
then rend, as follows:
And that the s?anl warrant* which have not been eatss-
1i< ti, amy be Jot .iU-d upon o^y oi itic. puLnc lands f ul.jcct to
private fut/y at tho tn>iu 0! the Ideation of thy saam.
The question was then taken, and the amend-
ment was agreed to.
Tiie SPEAKER. The question now is upon
the recommitment of the bill.
Mr. IIALL. I withdraw the motion to re-
commit.
j Mr. STANLY. I have no disposition further
! to postpone the bill, i only desired an apportu-
: tsity to examine it, and to call the attention of the
1 House to it.
| Mr. FULLER, of Maine, made^an inquiry,
: which was entirely inaudible ?o the reporter.
Mr. JOHNSON1 demanded the previous ques-
tion; which was seconded, and the main question
ordei ed.
; The questio" hem?, " Shall the bill po^s?" :t
was taken, and derided m the aifirmative.
i So the bill wa.'. parsed.
i Mr. JOHNSON. 1 move to reconsider the vote
: by which the bill was passed,and to lay the motion
1 to reconsider upon the t .ble.
, The question was uikea on the latter motion,
, and it was agreed to.
Mr. OLDS. ! ask the unanimous consent of
• the House that the Committee of the Whole on
the state of the Union be discharged from the
i further consideration of House hill No. 144; which
i is a bill to amend an act entitled " An act to reduce
