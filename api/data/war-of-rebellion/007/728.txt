FORT PILLOW, December 1, 1861.

Major-General POLK:

SIR: In obedience to order of Colonel De Russy, received by telegram yesterday, I now report to you conditions of things at this post:

We have in all fifty-eight 32-pounder guns; fifty-seven of them are mounted and ready for use; the remaining one is not mounted, for want of suitable carriage. Four of these guns are rifled and mounted in battery marked A on your camp, in place of the red guns sent to Columbus. Two guns have been recently sent to Memphis to be rifled, and will be mounted in same battery.

We have platforms ready for sixteen guns and room for eighteen more platforms not yet built.

The parapet of entire back line, as laid off on your map, is finished, except a small amount of work on a heavy embankment which crosses the Fulton Road Valley. I had commenced work extending the north end of entrenched line from the top of the hill down to Cold Creek, but the hands were taken to New Madrid and did but little work on it. The remaining work to be dome is about one mile of banquette, a half mile of clearing of timber, and the dressing up of the entire north or left flank.

The magazine in Battery B is finished; the work on the others was suspended for the want of timber. We now have timber sufficient
