HDQRS. DETACHMENT SECOND ARKANSAS CAVALRY.

Near Ozark, August 7, 1864.

Brigadier General J. B. SANBORN,Commanding District of Southwest Missouri, Springfield, Mo.:

GENERAL; I have the honor to report that the scout ordered by you through Douglas County returned yesterday and reported all quiet in that country. They were absent four days; marched 110 miles without finding one rebel. The lieutenant in command reports an organization of Federals, home guards, who appear to be doing good service. I hear nothing reliable from Northern Arkansas. It is reported that about 700 rebels are camped on Rolling Prairie, but cannot vouch for its being correct or whose command it is. If you have no objections, would like to send a scout of about fifty well-mounted men down that direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. BAILEY,

Captain, Commanding Detachment Second Arkansas Cavalry.
