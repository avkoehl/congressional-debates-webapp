six miles from Wathern's; also, on the road from Long Bridges, exact locality not accurately know, some report only three miles; also, on the Milledgeville road, three miles from Sandersville. I learn from a courier that General Allen is five miles in rear.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALFRED IVERSON,

Brigadier - General.

AUGUSTA, November 26, 1864.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary, Richmond:

So far we have failed to open communication with Macon, the enemy having interposed his whole force between us - seems to have neglected that point. This leaves us dependent on the force east of him. They are feeble in number, wanting in organization and discipline, and very deficient in equipments. No offensive movements can be undertaken, and but a temporary defense of our scattered posts. If no more means can be had our only policy is to make sacrifices and concentrate. The country is being utterly devastated wherever the enemy move.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

AUGUSTA, November 26, 1864.

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary, Richmond:

General Wheeler encountered the enemy's cavalry yesterday three miles west of Sandersville and drove them back to Buffalo Creek, when be found the infantry crossing. Prisoners captured represent for corps. The movements does not indicate whether this or Savannah the objective point.

RICHMOND, VA., November 26, 1864.

General BRAGG,

Augusta, GA.:

Yours of the 26th received. I hope you will soon hear from Macon and know of other forces. I do not understand suggestion as to making sacrifices for concentration.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

MACON, GA., November 26, 1864.

General J. B. HOOD:

Can you and Lee recommend to me a major - General of Army of Tennessee with sufficient rank to command Wheeler and his cavalry. He must be active, energetic, bold, and a good disciplinarian. His consent for transfer must be had.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
