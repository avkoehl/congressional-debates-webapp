Brigadier General E. H. HOBSON,

General Burbridge whipped Morgan handsomely at Mount Sterling yesterday morning. Morgan, with 2,000 men, was here from 2 to 7 this morning. Our small force skirmished with him last night and shelled him from the fort this morning. General Burbridge and command are now arriving and will pursue to-day. Believe rebels have gone to Frankfort; am satisfied they cannot leave the State.
