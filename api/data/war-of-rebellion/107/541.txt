WASHINGTON, D. C., February 26, 1862.

General F. W. LANDER,

Paw Paw, Va.:

Banks' advance occupies Harper's Ferry, and he is now throwing across the river at that place a pontoon bridge, after which a bridge of canal boats will be constructed, if this does not prove substantial. I do not think the movement on Winchester will be made until a proper bridge can be made. This will soon be deterined, when you will be duly informed. The present intention of the general commanding is for you to march by Bloomery, and I would think it advisable for you to make all your preliminary arrangemetns accordingly. The general will tiem your departure from your present position so as to reach Winchester about the same time with Banks' column. The information from Banks regarding the position of enemy at Winchester I sent you yesterday seems to make if quite positive. I regret that I cannot procure Snyder or Butler for you. The foremr is adie to General Sykes, and the latter the only officer present with his company.

General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN,

Sandy Hook:

Not a word from Buell since you left. Have ordered Rosecrans to guard the railroad bridge and send two companies of cavalry to New Creek bridge at once. General Meigs advises loading the subistence in the vessels at New York and Philadelphia, as it will save time and facilitate movements. Van Vliet and Shiras understood you to want the stores put on board here. I think this was a mistake, and authorized the former place. The uncertianty of matters down the river, in my judgment, makes this imperative. Artillery and cavalry will leave here in about two hours; private horses, servants, &amp;., to-morrow morning.
