army, reached Alexandria two days after we left, and has since been ordered to Washington, La. Major Pollock states that Taylor is sending a good deal of artillery to Washington, and concentrating supplies at that point. This is all I can learn of the enemy and his forces. I send a copy of this letter to department headquarters. Shall I still retain the detachment of the Thirteenth Army Corps here? As soon as the cavalry have had a couple of days' rest I shall start them again in pursuit of any force that may still remain on this side.

Since writing the above the pickets have brought in a prisoner belonging to Colonel Miller's regiment of Major's division, who informs me his regiment commenced to cross yesterday evening, and that he understood that the whole force was to cross as fast as they could. I shall again attack them, and repeat my request to the gun-boats to go around and prevent their recrossing.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,
