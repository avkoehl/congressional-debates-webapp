Gentlemen of the House of Represent-
atives: I thank you for the honor you have con-
ferred in selecting me to preside over your delib-
erations.
The delicateand responsible duties of the Chair
will be comparatively light if I shall be so fortu-
nate as to secure, as doubtless I shall, your co-
operation in maintaining the dignity and preserv-
ing the decorum of this body. The rules you
may adopt to regulate your proceedings I shall
seek most earnestly to administer firmly, faith-
fully, and impartially.
The great interests confided to our charge by
the people of this Confederacy admonish us to
cultivate a patriotism as expansive as the Re-
public itself
I cherish the ardent hope that our public duties
here may be discharged in such manner as to
uphold the Constitution, preserve the union of
these States, quicken their prosperity, and build
up the greatness and glory of our common coun-
try.
