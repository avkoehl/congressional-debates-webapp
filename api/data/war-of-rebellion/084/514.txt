HEADQUARTERS,Fort Wadsworth, August 1, 1864.

Captain R. C. OLIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, District of Minnesota:

SIR: After a successful march I reached the head of the Coteau de Prairie and camped on the Kettle Lakes at 10 a. m. on the 25th of July, and on the 26th Captain L. S. Burton, in command, with sixty cavalry of Company M, [Second Minnesota,] under Lieutenant Gardner, one mountain howitzer, in charge of Lieutenant Western with ten men, eighty infantry, under Lieutenants Jones and Cassimer, and Pierre Bottineau, chief of scouts, with ten scouts, 165 in all, marched for James River with instructions to examine the river from the mouth of Elm River to the Bone Hill River, in accordance with instructions from district headquarters. Captain L. S. burton returned with his command after a very severe march, and is so unwell that he has been unable to make a full report, but reports no timber on the James River I have been busy examining the country around the Kettle Lakes, which prevents me from making a full report at present, but which report will be dispatched by way of Fort Abercrombie on the 4th. I would respectfully state that the point I have selected for the fort has no disadvantages that cannot be overcome in another year, and many advantages that cannot be obtained in any other place. The old grass not having been burned off, will make it troublesome to obtain the amount of hay needed; but another year, by attending to having the hay ground burned, there will be little trouble. There is timber sufficient for building purposes,a nd fuel in abundance, with good water, with clay for brisk, and limestone. The site is the strongest without improvement I have seen, and the country around the head of the Coteau is far ahead of my expectations. I have to-day located Fort Wadsworth and will report in full by the 4th, and hope the commanding general will not think that I have neglected my duty. At this time I need rest, which I will be unable to take for some time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN CLOWNEY,

Major Thirtieth Regiment Wisconsin Volunteers, Commanding.
