200 muskets. Carolina reserves (1,700) all needed to guard prisoners at Columbia. We have to put in trenches here about 2,000 locals and convalescents. Rumors of enemy's advance on this place unreliable. I will do my utmost to aid General fry in every contingency. I use " victory" key.

Captain ELLIOTT,

Assistant Adjutant - General:

I arrived here safety this morning. Have no news at present to report. Could you not send up an operator and battery with the next train, as his presence here would save great inconvenience in dispatching. There is no operator here, and I have to send to Tennille for the purpose of dispatching. Answer.

General Fry telegraphs from Augusta that he wants 500 small arms; none here; and Major Huger has telegraphed to Savannah to have all sent on which you can spare. would be well to inform Fry of what he can get.
