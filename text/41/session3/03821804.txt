that an act for the relief of the officers and

of Representatives, was- certified by the Sec-
retary of the Senate as having passed the
Senate, was signed by the President of the
Senate and Speaker of the House of Repre-
sentatives, and by the President of the United
States, and appears on the statutes as a law
properly passed and approved June 1, 1870,
when in reality it never did pass the Senate.,
and its passage does not appear on the Journal.
To remedy this error it is proposed to enact
that the act so published as passed and approved
is hereby made valid, to all intents and pur-
poses, as if it had passed the Senate ; but no
other or greater payment shall be made by
virtue of t his act than that authorized by the
published act.
There being no objection, the bill was read
three times, and passed.
