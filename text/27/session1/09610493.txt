factor, or ant calam ty bejond his comtol, he, too
is equally entitled to relief under the bankrupt sys

ployments—I embrace all, and if they are bank
rupt from calamines, I will most cheerfully dis-
charge them from their debts, and set them free
Trust and securny debts and those of like charac-
ter, constitute exceptions, in regard to which I be-
lieve the best interests of society and of nenhty
require that there shall be no discharge without
paying the uttermost farthing I ha\e experi-
enced the feelings of a man made bankrupt by nvs
fortunes. My (nends, to relieve me from large
debts, bound themselves assny sureties, knowing
at the time that my future earnings alone would
enable me to meet the debts I was ruined by con
tracting deb s as surety for other people. I h?ve
relievtd mjself irom the burlen by jears of tnl
and anxiety Í rejoice 'hat this bill can mw have
no personal opei anon in my behalf 1 have re
covered from th- d.sasttrs of early life, and, as it
regards my c'aim for mi neys paid as snrety, death
has removed the principal obligors beyond my
reach, and placed them where this bill can do them
«either good nor evil I know, therefore, what-
ever influence my past expeuence and sufferings
may have in forming my opinions, that I am not
governed by any principle of personal interest I
am willing to observe" the golden rule of doing as I
would be done by This bill goes greater l ngths
than I could have asked when such a measure
m'ghthave been a relief to me, and hence I shall
voie against it im'ess i< is amended.
The friends of fie measure have suage t->d the
propriety of pas mg ihe bill in its picent form aad
postponing i*s oneration until February, with a
view to cure its defects next winter Tnit cowse
is not sa ¡sfaetory to me If the bill is not to go
into operation unti1 February, why not lay it on
the table until we meet again, and then perfect it?
It can benefi' no bankrupt by being parsed now,
unless you permit it to take effect immediately
The very fact that you postpone its operation, with
a view to legislate again upon ihe subject, is cal-
culated to alarm the bankrupt mita fears that you
may repeal it altogetb r, or modify it in some way
injurious to him, while its manifest defects are
well calculated to excite a refl ct ng people, and
cause them to demand its repeal My experience
here has taught me that verj Utile is done during
the first two months of a Ions session, and I appre
hend February will arrive, and this bill re-nun
just as it is. The desire and haste to pa<s it just
as it came from the Senate, proceed, I stipnose,
from political considerations It i, miserab'e patty
po'icy, m my opinion, to attempt to gam popula-
rity by pasnng bills flagrantly defective, both in
working mach nery and principle By such a .na
nrauvie you may secure a flourish of (rumpe's and
the puffi of newspapers, but thsy will certain!  be
succeeded by pcpular indignation, when the re-
suls of your defective legislation are not only seen,
b n fel Then yoar gratilatio-ia and t mranh w li
be changed ti dismay and defea', at<d the), r< si
blv, yor may find leisure, m retirement, to mourn
ever yoor biomder".
I wish to say but one ihmg mo-e To guam
agaras' fraud, you shiuld amend this bill by pro-
v ding that any bankrupt who should colWt or
U e any money or propfr y which, before oMaini«g
his discbarge, he hid lent or placed in any manner
whoever m the hands of others, and which he had
omitted to surien er >•> his «cheduk, or it he should
receive iiom a per-on, after obtaining his dis
cha ge, an, mo ey or proper!.,, in consideration of
mo ey or >np«ny placd in the ha ids of su^hper
son before obtaining ihe discharge, ihen the decree
ard certificate ol bankrup cy should be voil and
11 no effect. Tri^ provision would tend to prevent
those secret arrang ments by which fn=nds may
fraudulently endeavor to hide from creditors the
means of the bankrupt, and to give him the btnefit
thereof after the proceedings in court have been
clo ed by a defr e a>*d certificate of discharge
Such an intendment would be important m those
cases where cr ltors arealowid to con pel in-
dividuals to submit, as bankrupts, to the provi-
sions of the bii1
At the prop  time I shall offer air-endments to
meet th- views I have expressed, and, if adopted,
I w ill cheerfu'ly aive my vole in favor of the bi 1
Note—Mr Underwood did offer various
amendnenN, a!1 which were rejecled, and there-
upon he moved to 'ay the bill upon the table,
which was carri"d. But i n tne next day the m -

fortune? the dtctor, the lawyer, the farmer, as
well as the merchant? A th*ou a d casualties await
every class, every m'erest The drought destroys
ihe farmer's crop, the murrain his cattle and
fl')ck<, the fire consumes his houses and bis grana-
ries His means of payment are crippled by the
act of God, no interest is beyond the reach of cala-
mity The Southern planter or the Northern farmer
selle his crops to the merchant on the seaboard;
he takes the merchant's note in payment, and rely-
log upon the punctual psrformance of the promise,
c mtracts debt , of his own. The merchant ships
his purchase to some distant port, and in its passage
¡t is swallowtd up in the waves The gentleman'*
principles come to the relief cf the nerchaut. A
commission of oankruptcy releases him from the
debt You discharge him from ihe obligation he
has contracted to his customer, but you still hokt
the industrious and hard working firmer to the fall
payment of the debts he has contracted He may
labor on fiom yea' to yeai—there is ne benevo
lence, no compassion for him' You make him the
victim of a common calamity and of partial bene-
ficence God has not exempted him from the visi-
tations of his providence, but human enactments,
impiously revering the impartia>t«i%s of the Cre-
ator, would place him beyond the reach of mercy,
the most lovely attribute of the Divinity. The
gentleman is content with a community of suffer-
ing, but not of compassion Sir, I was surprised
to hear these strange sentiments fall from the gen-
tleman—sentiments winch I do not neníate to de-
Hounce as im vortny o' this occasion, of this coun-
try, and of this age
The honoiable memcer raises still ano her and
a more singular objection to the bill He insists
that "the debtor would be able to centrol the cre-
ditor, that ihe b 11 reverses the wisdom of Solomon,
who has declared that 'the borrower is slave to the
lender.' "
And is this the principle on which the gentleman
acts? upon which the bul is to be opposed? "The
borrower a slave to the lender I" Eternal bondage
of body and mind, without release, without alle-
viation, without hope, awaits the insolvent. He
may toil to support his offspring, but he toils m
vain a npacious creditor «eizes, by divine right,
the fruits of his labor, he leaves an mhentaaee
of poverty, perhaps ignominy, 'o his children, and
death alone can finally break his shackle . But
the idea th u the borr >wer is the lave of the lender
pu^ht not, peihaps, so much to urprise u«, coming
from th^ r-ource it doe^ I recollect, cir, reading,
amorg other incid-nts m the early colonial history

codec ntamed in the Scrip ures were tolerably well
adopted to human affairs,and that sometime must
elapse before their own legislative labors could
'egulate their inierf«'s, they wisely reso ved that

A third objection is abo urged by the gentle-

REMARKS  OF MR. HOWARD,

Inthe House of Representatives, Jluguit 16, 1841—On
the bill to establish a uniform system of bank-
run cy throughout the United Stite', in Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr Cbaikman It is not w th tne va n hope of
adding to ihe torce of the arguments alreadv mged

tne patience o th  committee and were it not that
my constituents feel a deeper interest in Ihe suc-
cess of this measure than perhaps ir> that of any
other that is likely to be accomplished at the pre-
sent session of Congress, I should still remain
silent, reposing with confidence upon the intrinsic
merits of the bill, and the able advocacy of those
of its friends who have already addressed the com-
mittee Cut, sir, my duty to my constituents for-
bids me to remain silent I should be but a fa se
exponent of their feelings, an unwonhy ho der of
the trust they have so generously confided to me,
were I suffer the rccision to pa's without some
effort on my part to give expression to their views
on this important subject. Their anxiety is
evincsd by t-ieir numcr ms petitions, now berrrf
