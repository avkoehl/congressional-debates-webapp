United States Bank—Mr. Ñílrn.
Séiíaté.
to sell the bonds of the bank held by the United
States, and nothing seemed, therefore, both more
natural and proper than that he should render to
Congress an explicit account of the manner in
which he had executed that trust, yet all that he
says of the slightest importance on that subject is
conprehended in this single oracular line   " The
sale of one of the bonds becoming expedient, it
was effected within the limitations prescribed "
Of the ■specific terms of the sale, to whom  sold,
the mode of payment, and other particulars of
the transaction, he is altogether silent     It had
been stated, and generally believed, that the bond
had been sold to the bank itself    But there is
nothing in the report which gives the slightest
intimation of who the purchaser was    Then, as
to the proceeds of the bond, what was done with
them, where deposited, how applied, there is the
like mysterious reserve and ambiguity    There
is nothing in the report of the Secretary even to
assist conjecture on this point, but a small docu-
ment subjoined to his report, which he calls " a
list of banks in which special deposits have been
made to the credit of the Treasurer of the United
States, derived only from debts due fiom banks,
and the amount m each subject to draft on the 1st
of December, 1838 "   This list comprehends but
two banks—" the Bank of the United States, of
Pennsylvania,™ which the amount is $1,738,488,"
(one million seven bundled and thirty-eight thou-
sand four hundred and eighty eight dollars,) and
the " Bank of Vngtma, Richmond, with the pit
tance of $32,146 "(thirty two thousand one hun
t red and forty six dolíais )    Now, whethei these
«leposits in the Bank of the United States are the
proceeds of the sale of Us bond, oi  of whatever
other funds they may consist, we are left wholly
¡n the dark    We are told, with a vague general-
ly, that they "are deuved from debts due fiom
' anks," but from what banks, fiom the Bank of
lie United States itself, or from some othei banks,

etter to Mr Adams, that his differences with his
old antagonist are settled   that " he his no longer
con troveisies with the Government of the Union,"
that " anangements had been made"—he cour-
teously adds " as honoraole to the executive offi-
cets as beneficial to the public service"—" which
had biought the Government into efficient coop-
eiation with the bank foi the íeestabltshment of
the currency," yes, sn, had brought (maik the
phrase) the Government into efficient coopeiation
with the bank, that •" in the month of July the
Government had agreed to íeceive an anticipated
payment of the bonds of the bank, to the amount
of between four and five million dollars, in a
credit to the Treasurer on the books of the bank
and, also, that " arrangements were made for the
more distant public- disbmsements in the notes of
the bank " Under these circumstances, the bank
is willing to disarm, it proclaims a cessation of
hostilities, " it abdicatesits involuntary power,
and "desires only repose " It may well, indeed,
retire from the field of controveisy, under such
circumstances, to " repose" on the laméis of its
victory
Now, Mr President, this letter is the first offi-
cial information we have had of who the purchaser
of the bark's bonds was It shows, as had been
geneially believed before, that they were sold to
the bank itself—a fact which, from some cause or
other, the Secretary seemed sedulously to with-
hold It shows also in what manner the bank
was to pity the purchase money of the bonds,
which the law required should be sold for "money
in hand " "The Government, "says Mi Biddle,
"agieed to receive payment 'in a credit to the
Treasurer on the books of the bank " " But the
Secretary of the Treasury, speaking of the Gov-
ernment funds in the bank, describes them (as we
have already seen) as special deposits. Presum-
ing that the public funds in the bank are, for the
most part, at least, of the proceeds of the sale of
its bonds, it will be for the Secretary to show
what sort of a special deposit can be made of a
naked credit on the books of a bank This, it
seems to me, would be a sort of lusus natura in.
banking accounts The president of the bank
also says that the Government had agreed to re-
ceive an anticipated payment of its bonds to the
amount of between four and five million dollars
The only anticipated payments shown by the
Secretary, in his statement of the Tieasury re-
ceipts for the year, are one of $2,254,871, being
the proceeds of the third bond, and another of
$1,600,000, part of the second bond, beirg an ag-
gregate of $3,854,871—$3,854,871 only The
president of the bank finally informs us that "ai-
rangements weie made for the moie distant pub-
lic disbursements in the notes of the bank " The
Secretary is wholly silent as to any such arrange
ments He will, doubtless, be glad of the oppoi
(unity I piopose to afford him of explaining these
diseiepancies and omissions, and of showing on
which side the euot oi fault lies
Atnll events, these transactions should be thor-
oughly and distinctly undeistood by thccountiy
The chaiacter of the Government and the public
inteiests demand it Was the sale of the bank's
bonds, as their conversion into ciedits on the
books of the bank has been called, a simple and
naked transaction of sale, or was it not connected
with stipulations and conditions that the bank
should have the deposit of the public moneys ac
ciuin^fiom them, till they weie wanted for actual
expenditure that it should enjoy also the benefit
arising from the unequal lates of exchange, in
tiansfei ring them to the points where they would
be required foi disbursement, and that the circu-
lation of the bank should be aided and extended
by the Government by its making use of the notes
of the bank in its moie distant disbuisements'
Has the bank been made depository and fiscal
agent of the Government for the sums aitsmg fiom
the sale of its bonds only, or foi othei sums also
tiansfened to it from other sources' All these aie
questions to which the public attention is keenly
awakened, and it will be satisfied with nothing
shoit of a thorough elucidation of them If the
hostilities so long existing between the Govern-
ment and the bank have all of a sudden ceased,
and then contioveisies been happily adjusted, as
the president of the bank infoims us,th¡ countiy
is interested in knowing on what terms, and by
what means, the adjustment has Uken place Is i
the cessation of hostilities an aimistnc only, or a
final pacification' Is it a tieatv of peace, oi of |
both amity and peace' Is it an alliance, oi a con j
vention of subsidies' If an alliance, is it offensive i
and defensive, or defensive only ' It a convention
of subsidies, which paity pays the subsidies,
and which furnishes the contingent of auxihaiy
troops' If, finally, the bank " abdicates itsinvol
untai) power," is it a total and complete renun-
ciation of its claims to empue, oi does it abdicate
the throne only that it may be " the power behind
the throne greater than the throne itself"
These questions acquire astill giavei character
and deeper interest fiom the significant Specula
tions indulged on the appearance of Mr Biddle s
letter by certain leading journals known to be
f.iendly to the bank, and supposed to be, more
or less, conversant with its views     One of them,
commenting on the letter of the president of the
bank,  bays, "the bank will, no doubt, in the
course of a short time, by an insensible piocess,
become the fiscal agent of the Government     An
othei, with íefeienee to the same lettei.says,    it
will be a curious and not improbable spectacle if
we see, through the instrumentality of co.icuinng
circumstances, a national banlneestablished with
out the action of Congress," &c    A national
bank reestablished without the action of Con-
gress ' What easier or simpler than to do it, by
the " insensible process" already commenced*
Let the Executive, at his own will and pleasure,
adopt the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States
as the fiscal agent and depository of the Govern-
ment—let it join the weight of the public reve-
nues to the already enormous capital of that insti-
tution—let it superadd the credit arising from a
connection with the Government to the extensive
and pervading operations in which the bank is
engaged throughout the Union, And have "you not
a national bank reestablished to all intents and
purposes—reestablished without the concurrence
of Congiess, and in despite of its authority > and
would it not be a national bank of the most dan-
gerous and worst possible kind' Created by the
fiat of the Executive alone—allied with the Exec-
utive and dependent on the Executive—without
any of those guaids and securities against abuse
which the legislative authority would provide-
no committee of Congress to examine and report
on its condition and proceedings—" the secrets of
its prison-house" open to no eye bat its own, and
its lelations with its political pahon and ally
scieened fiom all knowledge but that of the high
contracting parties themselves The imagination
of man cannot conceive a more perfect and fear-
ful personification of that "concentrated moneyed
power" which the President speaks of in his mes-
sage, not " tempted" merely, but compelled by
the law of its being, " to become an active agent
in political affairs " Obsta pitncipus is the ad-
monition of wisdom in all human concerns, and
now that the " insensible process" is just begun,
which, if not arrested, may terminate ma connec-
tion so dangerous and fatal between this powerful
institution and the Executive, I come forward, and
as was done on the occasion of another memora-
ble coalition in another country, in the name of
my countiy, I forbid the bans
But I have still another and more extensive
object, Mr President, in moving the resolutions
on youi table     I desire to show, by the acts of
the Administration, that, whatever dissertations
and homilies the executive officers may favor us
with, on the sub-Tieasuiy system, and m favor
of a divorce from banks, they have, by their
practice, borne the highest of all testimony to
the supenor safety, convenience, and other ad-
vantages of banks as depositories and fiscal agents
of the Goveinment     Since the suspension   of
specie payments by the banks, aceoiding to the
construction put upon the deposit act of June,
1836, by the Sccretai y of the Treasury, and con-
curied in by the Committee on Finance of this
body, then are hardly any banks which aie com-
petent to be employed as deposito!íes undei the
piovisions of that act     By that law, it is said,
no bank can be legally employed as a dcpositoiy
of the public moneys, in the m inner and on the
terms contcirq lated by it, which may have at any
time since July 1,1836, issued notes of a less de-
nomination than five dollars   T his being the ease
with neaily all the banks, the consequence has
been that the Tieasuiy Department has been left
almost entnely to its own discietion as to the
manner of keeping the public money, and, in the
exeicise of this discretion, it has continued, for
the most part, still to employ banks as depisit
ones, styling them, howevci, sptcial instead  of
geneia! depositories, as they would be undei the
act of Juno, 1836     It appeals fiom the annual
repoi t of the Secietary, now befoi o me, that there
aie at present sixteen banks (including the Bank
of the United States) so employed, at the discre-
tion of the Department, ovei and above the four
which still remain geneial depositories, under the
piovisions of the law of June, 1836    The public
moneys deposi ed in these sixteen banks are dc
