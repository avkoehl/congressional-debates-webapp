HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 27, 1864-8 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following movements have been seen to-day since my report of 9.50 a. m.: At 11.30 a. m. about 100 cavalry passed a point on Squirrel road, 300 yards left of lead-works, moving toward the right; probably the same force that moved tot he left at 9.40 a. m. At 3 p. m. a section of artillery passed same point, going to the left. At 5 p. m. about 200 men, with intrenching tools, came outside the works in front of lead-works and passed to the left out of view. At 6 p. m. about 300 men advanced to the front and passed into the woods out of view. I think they were going on picket.

Respectfully,

General AYRES:

GENERAL: I wish you would have your pioneers clear out all the obstructions in the draining ditches in the field where we are now, and good wagon road bridges put over them wherever needed, instead of the filling of rails and earth they now have in places. We must make every effort to secure good drainage in order to prevent sickness.
