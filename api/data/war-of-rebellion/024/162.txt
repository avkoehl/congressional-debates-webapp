ROSECRANS' HEADQUARTERS,

Corinth, October 5, 1862.

McArthur pursued the enemy 5 1\2 miles with small force. Was re-enforced in the night with five regiments. He was encamped within short distance of two regiments of enemy's rear guard. McKean followed at daylight with balance of division, supported by Hamilton's division. McPherson, Stanley, and Davies were to start at daylight, but through error were delayed. They take route north of railroad toward Pocahontas; balance south. Now is the time for Steele to pitch in, while they are all looking this way. Rebel prisoners talk of re-enforcements and fighting again.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
