Captain.

LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN, October 5, 1863.

Captain MANNING:

There are but few guns visible in fixed position, their pieces being well masked in order to prevent observation from this point. For several days they have kept field pieces harnessed up in readiness to move. On the toe of the Moccasin there are visible one casemated gun and two exposed. On their extreme right we can see three pieces between the river and railroad, and four midway from the railroad to star fort. By the firing this a. m. four pieces have been revealed in the star fort. Immediately beyond star fort six pieces can be seen. Farther we can discover none until reaching the large earth-work on their extreme left. On their interior lines earth-works mounting guns begin at the base of Cameron Hill, crossing the railroad about 300 yards south of depot, continuing through woods to rear of star fort. The number of guns in those works cannot be ascertained by aid of best glasses.

DUVALL,

Lieutenant.
