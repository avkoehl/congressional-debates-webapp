WAR DEPARTMENT,

April 3, 1865-10.30 a.m.

The PRESIDENT:

I congratulate you and the nation on the glorious news in your telegram just received. Allow me respectfully to ask you to consider whether you ought to expose the nation to the consequence of any disaster to yourself in the pursuit of a treacherous and dangerous enemy like the rebel army. If it was a question concerning yourself only I should not presume to say a word. Commanding generals are in the line of their duty in running such risks; but is the political head of a nation in the same condition?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

CITY POINT, VA., April 3, 1865-5 p.m.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Yours received. Thanks for your caution, but I have already been to Petersburg. Staid with General Grant an hour and a half and returned here. It is certain now that Richmond is in our hands, and I think I will go there to-morrow. I will take care of myself.

A. LINCOLN.

CITY POINT, VA., April 3, 1865-11 a.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Weitzel telegraphs as follows:

We took Richmond at 8.15 this morning. I captured many guns. The enemy left in great haste. The city is on fire in two places. Am making every effort to put it out. The people received us with enthusiastic expressions of joy.

General Grant started early this morning with army toward the Danville road to cut off Lee's retreating army if possible. President Lincoln has gone to the front.

T. S. BOWERS,

PETERSBURG, April 3, 1865.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

City Point, Va.:

Say to the President that an officer and escort will attend him, but as to myself I start toward the Danville road with the army. I want to cut off as much of Lee's army as possible.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
