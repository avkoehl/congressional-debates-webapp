The VICE PRESIDENT also presented a com-

transmitting the amount of duties upon foreign
imports during the first quarter of the year 1834,
and furnishing estimates of the probable receipts
of the remaining quarters of the year
The report was as follows
Treasury Department,
June 16th, 1834
Sir. In compliance with the resolution of the
Senate of the 7th of May last, directing the Sec-
retary of the Treasury " to report as soon as
'practicable, to the Senate, the amount of duties
' received and accrued on foreign impoits, during
' the fii st quarter of the year 1834, with a table
' showing the comparative amount of that quar-
' ter, and the corresponding quarter of the year
'1833, and distinguishing between the amounts
' ace-ued or received at each port " Also,
" whether anything has happened since his annual
'repoit was made at the commencement of the
' present session of Congress, to vary, in his
' opinion, the estimate contained in the said report,
' of the proceeds of the dut es on foreign imports
' for the year 1834," I herewith tiansmit the state-
ment required by the fust resolution above men-
tioned, by which it appears that the duties which
accrued from customs in the first quarter of 1833,
amounted to the sum of %5,798,114 87, and in
the corresponding quarter of 1834, to the sum of
$5,344 540 40, and that the actual receipts into
the Treasury from the same source in the former
quarter, amounted to $6,966,437 09, and m the
lattei, to $4,435,386 13 A few of the minor
ports have not been heaid from; but they cannot
materially vary the result.
In answer to the second resolution, I have the
honor to state, that estimating the duties on foreign
imports in the annual report made at the com-
mencement of the present session, it was assumed
as the basis of the estimate, that the imports of
the present year would be nearly equal to those of
1832    This estimate was higher than the average
imports of the five or six preceding years, bnt,
as stated in that report, it was considered as a
safe one, because, although the imports of 1831
and 1832 had been unusually large, those of 1833
had gone still higher, and the general state of com-
merce, and the situation of the country,justified
the belief that there would be no serious diminu-
tion in the present year.
Prom the comparative statement of the amount
of duties which accrued in the first quarter of the
present year, and the corresponding quarter of
1833, it appears that the amount of foreign imports
in the first quarter of 1834, must have exceeded
that of the corresponding quarter in the preceding
year Seveial articles, which form important
items in our ordinary imports, and paid duty in
the first quarter of 1833, were free from duty in
thefi.st quarter of 1834, and the rate of duty was
reduced on others, and the differenee between the
amount of duty wh'ch accrued in these two quar-
ters would have been greater, if the importations
m the latter had not exceeded those of the former
In some instances, withoutdoubt, importations,
which, in the ordinary course of our foreign trade,
would have been made in the last quarter of 1833,
were delayed until the first quarter of the present
year, in order to obtain the benefit of the reduced i
tariff, which took effect on the first of January
last, and this circumstance has enlarged, in some
degree, the imports of the fiist quarter of 1834
But after making a due allowance foi the increase
which may have ausen from this cause, and
which would be peculiar to the first quartei of the
year, the amount of duties which accrued in the
quarter are sufficient to show that the imports of
the present yeai will most probably exceed the
amount at which they were estimated in the
annual report, and be fully equal to those of 1833,
which were unusually large If this expectation
should be realized, the proceeds of the customs
will exceed the amount at which they were esti
mated by more than $1,000,000 The difFeience
in the comparative receipts of the two first quar-
ters, as shown by the statement herewith trans-
mitted, does not arise from any fluctuation m
commerce or diminished importations, but is
chiefly occasioned by the alterations in the times
of payments, intioduced by the act of 14th July,
1832
The receipts of the first quarter, and the bonds
already taken, confiim the opinion that the income
from customs will be greater than the estimate
presented at the commencement of the session
The actual receipts into the Treasury from cus
toms for the first quarter of the present year
amounted to the sum of ยง4,435,386 13, and the
du'ies secured by bonds, payable in the second
quarter, amount to the sum of $4,005,368 77
After making a fair deduction from these amounts
for return duties, which may yet be called for,
and for debentures and expenses of collection, the
net income of these two quarters may be safely
estimated at $7,500,000 And if the third and
fourth quarters should be only equally productive
with the two first, the receipts will equal the
amount at which they were estimated in the an-
nual report But, under our present system of
duties, the receipts from customs in the ordinary
course of commeice will always be greater in the
two last quarters of the year than in the two first
The woolen goods, which form so large a portion
of our imports, are for the most part brought into
the country in the third and fourth quarters of the
year. The high duties with which they are
charged render them a very productive source of
revenue, and being now'payable in cash, they
enter into the receipts of the third and fourth
quarters in which the goods are imported. The
receipt of these two quarters of the year will,
therefore, generally exceed those of the two pre-
ceding ones by at least one million of dollars.
Although not embraced in the resolution, it will
no doubt be gratifying to the Senate to learn that
the receipts from the lands are equally encouraging,
and will more than equal the amount at which they
were estimated The receipts into the Treasury,
from this source, during the first quarter of the
present year, amount to the sum of $1,398,206 18,
while in the corresponding quarter of 1823, they
amounted only to $668,526 66, and from the re-
turns already received for the present quarter, the
receipts of the two first quaiters of this year from
lands, may be safely estimated at more than
$2,000,000 In the annual report, the receipts
for the whole year weie estimated at $3,000,000.
The information above stated, shows that the
anticipated income from this source, as well aa
fiom the customs, will be more than realized.
Upon the whole, the information received since
the annual report on the finances was made to
Congress, affords satisfactory evidence that the
extent of our foreign commerce has been fully
sustained, and gives strong reasons for believing
that the receipts into the Treasury during the
present year will be greater than the amount
which they were estimated at the commencement
of the present session
I beg leave to repeat what I have already said
in the annual report from this department, that as
the receipts of each year, under the present system
of short credits and cash duties, must mainly
depend on its own importations, the estimates for
the year can never be made with as much certainty
as under the former system, when the receipts
chiefly depended on the duties which had accrued
in preceding years, and which were ascertained
and secured by bonds before the time the estimates
were presented
And as all calculations on the amount of revenue
hereafter to acerve, must be more or less uncertain,
and are liable to be affected by unforeseen contin-
gencies, it would hardly be proper to appropriate
on a scale of expenditure fully equal to the ex-
pected income There is, however, no reason for
apprehending that the resources of the present
year can fall short of the estimate contained in
the annual report And it is believed, that ap-
propriations may be made with entire safety
according to that estimate
I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully,
your obedient servant,
