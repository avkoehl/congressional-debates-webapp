Mr JONES said that he was not opposed to the defence of

the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr Tolano ] he should
readily vote for n, but all Congiess might give under such an
amendment must only increasethedifficulty of settlement The
man now asked a hundred thousand dollars, pass this apr.ro
pnation and he would ask a hundied and filty thousand Be
sides the Ur lied States could get no jurisdiction until the island
was ceded according to the Constitution Unless this were
done, the State would have the right to tax the property, as
Pennsylvania had taxed the Pa*.syunk arsenal
Mr MORGAN was surprised that any man should be in fa-
vor ot the amen 'ment Nobody would eoactin his own pri
vate affairs Who would expend money on a farm when he
knew Ite had no title?
Mr RANDALL of Maryland replied to the argument oí
Mr McK v.Y who had urged that the title to the fort, if not
ceded, must he obtained by purchase True this was the word
employedm the Constitution but what lawyer did not know
that the technical meaning of the word purchase comprehended
every mode ofacquisinon of pioperty, except by descent? And
in that sense no doubt, it had been employed by the framers of
the Constitution
Mr R statedthaf, m 1813 (he State of Delaware had ceded
the Pea Patch island to Go\ eminent as a part of its terruoiy,
Government had taken possession of it for the purport of
erecting a fort, and ten years after came up a claim under me
S'ate of New Jersey, for all the islands in the Delaware
were sub;ects oldispue between New Jersey andDelawaie
>ow, if the claimant had stood b> foi en years, and had re-
frained from making his claim, while ihe Government were
expending money on the land, his claim was not Worth a
farthing
Mr RANDOIPH said the gentleman -was under misap-
prehension The claimant had been m possession from the
fii st, and had been forcibly removed He had pleaded his claim
ever since
Mr RANDALL resumed, and opposed the appropriation
of any money until the disputed title should be settled
He thought it would be better to abandon the island alto
gether and choose another site What was the use of spend
mg money on a thing that was immediately to be thrown
into court?
Mi HAT SI ED modified h s amendment, but the Chair pro
nounced the mo lification not tobe in oidei
Ihe question was then taken on the amendment proposed by

Mr HAI -TED no v moved to add after the words, Delaware

Mi n\ERETT was in ftvor of the amendment because-,
if the title was now in the United States, the money would at
