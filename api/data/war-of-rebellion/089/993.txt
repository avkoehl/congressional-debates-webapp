FRED. SANDROCK,

First Lieutenant and Acting Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION, December 13, 1864.

Brigadier-General TURNER,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Colonel Evans, of the First Maryland Cavalry, reports to me that a party under the direction of some engineer officer has commenced cutting trees in the camp of the First Maryland Cavalry for the purpose of corduroying the New Market road, saying that they are directed to do so by General Ord. I presume it is not the general's intention to disturb the camp of the First Maryland, and trust that the party will be directed to cut their timber elsewhere.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS, December 13, 1864-10 p.m.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Williamsburg:

The commanding general directs that your order the two companies cavalry now at Williamsburg, with their officers, to be prepared to embark at moment's notice, any time after 3 o'clock to-morrow, to accompany me on special service. They will be armed with saber and carbine and take with them 100 rounds ammunition, four days' forage for their horses. The rations, forage, and ammunition will be put on board a transport that will be sent to receive them, that the men may be unencumbered. Every man that can be mounted will be required to go. Acknowledge receipt.

DAVENPORT,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

CITY POINT, VA., December 14, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

What has been done with Steele? He is too good a soldier immediately in command of troops to leave idle. As Canby asked his removal, I think it will be better to order Steele here in command of the Ninth Corps and send Parke to Canby.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
