of canal navigation. There are also one hundred
ana twenty-five miles of river navigation from Rich-
mond to Norfolk.—Reports of Committee of National
Hoard of J. rade on the Virginia water-line.
Ihe plan proposed by the late engineer of
the canal, Mr. Edward Lorraine, contemplated
a canal forty-two feet wide at the bottom,
seventy feet at the water surface, and with a
depth of water of seven feet; the locks to be
one hundred and twenty feet long between
the gates. The practicability of this work is
purely a scientific question, to be determined
by the engineers alone. I believe that every
engineer of any eminence who has exam-
ined the question has reported that the work
was practicable. We have the report of Fisk,
Ellet and Lorraine, and lastly of the engineer
department of the Army of the United States,
all agreeing that the work can be done, at a
cost which all must agree is reasonable, in
comparison with the advantages to be derived.
The cost and financial promise of the work
caji beat be given in the figures of Mr. Lor-
raine :
With reference to the financial promiseof this line
of navigation, Mr. Lorraine presents the following
estimates:
Capital invested in new works, say $40,000,000
Capital invested in old works, say  4.92(5,664
Preferred six per cent, stock of the State 7,400,000
Total capital invested $52,326,664
Probable Revenues.

per ton per mile  50,000
200,000 tons to and from Lynehburg, 146
miles, at 2 cent per ton per mile  219,000

200,000 tons to and from Covington, 243 miles,
at 4 mills per ton per mile  194,400

Net revenue $8,665,150
which is more than 16 per cent, on a capital of
653,000,000.
It is legitimate to conclude that this work, which
will be open for business throughout almost the
whole year, will compare favorably in its financial
results with the Erie canal.
The enthre cost of constructing the Erie canal to
1863 was $38,977,831, (nearly thirty-nine millions.)
This sum, with interest to 1863, amounted to $52,-
491,915. l)uring the same period the gross receipts
from tolls were $71,783,676, (nearly seventy-two mil-
lions.) After deducting expenses ($12,518,860) there
remained a net profit of $59,264,812, not only suffi-
cient to pay the entire cost of construction with
interest, but leaving a surplus of nearly seven mil-
lion dollars. Of the gross earnings, it appears that
but little more than one sixth was required to
meet expenses and repairs. Five sixths were net
gain. This included not only the period after the
enlargement, but before, when the canal was in an
unfinished condition, with costs of repairs greater
and receipts less. Since 1862 the net earnings have
been about twenty million dollars more. From
1862 to the end of the fiscal year 18bS the amount of
tolls paid to the State was $25,260,381. No other im-
provement, railroad or other, can make such an
exhibit. The Erie canal has not only paid for its
own construction, but makes itself a present to the
State, with about $27,000,000 net profit.
It might be considered by some that the
estimate of tonnage given by Mr. Lorraine is
too great ; but this is not the case. Take the
article of coal, the estimate of Mr. Lorraine is
for one million tons per annum. Now the fol-
lowing considerations, I submit, will satisfy
any candid person that Mr. Lorraine greatly
underestimates the quantity of coal winch will

be carried over the canal. The coal beds on
thisline are situated in the country adjacent to
the New and Kanawha rivers and their tribu-
taries. At those points where these streams
pass through the coal measures the beds of
the streams are some distance below the level
of the coal, which lies horizontally.
In most coal mines I believe the shafts have
to be sunk perpendicularly, and much trouble
and expense are caused by the necessity of
pumping out the water and supplying fresh
air, and the labor is greatly increased because
it is necessary to elevate the coal, sometimes to
a great height. Now these Kanawha coal
measures being situated above the level of the
proposed canal, the shafts can be run in hori-
zontally, and no expense will be incurred for
draining or ventilation ; and as the shafts are
extended railways can be built and the coal
can be transported in cars to the canal boats.
In this way the coal can be mined and deliv-
ered on the boats at very small cost.
To give some idea of the quantity of coal
which will probably be transported, I will cite
the following fact: the Chesapeake and Ohio
railroad, extending along this line, from the
city of Richmond to the Ohio at Huntington,
has been completed within the last few days,
and I see from the papers that one company
alone has offered to furnish to this road for
transportation one thousand tons of coal per
day, or say three hundred thousand tons per
annum. Now, if this is proposed by one com-
pany alone in the mere infancy of the enter-
prise. and with the comparatively high freights
of a railroad, what may we not expect if the
cheaper transportation by canal is supplied.
' Again, the Baltimore and Ohio railroad
is engaged in transporting coal from Cumber-
land. From their last annual report I learn that
during the year 1872 this road transported
1,661,259 tons of coal, exclusive of the com-
pany's supply on the main stem; that is nearly
twice as much per annum as Mr. Lorraine esti-
mates for our Virginia canal. Now, when we
take into consideration the kinds of coal to be
found on the Virginia line, namely, the cannel
coal for fuel for domestic purposes ; the bitum-
inous coal for steam vessels, railroads, and fac-
tories ; and the splint coal for iron furnaces,
all of which can be mined very cheaply; and
when we add to this the fact that this liue
passes through inexhaustible beds of as fine
iron ore as is to be found in the world, may
it not be safely estimated that five or six mil-
lion tons of coal and as much iron will pass
over the canal each year?
I propose now to give some statistics and
calculations showing the advantages of this
canal to the West.
That vast area of country extending from
the Alleghany mountains on the east to the
Rocky mountains on the west, and from the
thirty-sixth degree of north latitude to our
northern border and even far beyond that,
along the headwaters of the Eed River of the
North, is destined at 110 distant day to become
the granary from which in great part are to be
fed the people of the Atlantic slope of the
United States, of portions of South America,
and of western Europe. The resources of this
mighty section are just beginning to be devel-
oped, and yet production is fast and far out-
running the means of transportation. The
demand for cheaper transportation to the sea-
board is every day growing stronger and
stronger in the West; and the party or poli-
tician who shall oppose a judicious application
of a portion of that vast sum which is annually
taken from the people by taxation to the pur-
poses of this cheaper means of transportation,
must lose all influence and power in the West
and South.
I have prepared with some degree of care,
from the ninth census, a statement of the pop-
ulation and principal productions of the eleven
western States most immediately interested in
this question. These tables show, the popula-
tion, the production of wheat, corn, and pota-
toes, and of cattle, sheep, and hogs, in these
eleven States:

The total population of the United States
was in 1870, 38,558,371. So that the popula-
tion of these eleven States was somewhat over
one third of the entire population of the Uni-
ted States.
Now let us see the crop and stock statistics
of those States:

The entire number of cattle other than milch cows
and work oxen in the United States was 18,566,005 ;
of sheep, 28,477,957; of swine, 25,134,569.
It will be seen from these tables that these
eleven States, with a population slightly ex-
ceeding one third of the entire population of the
United States, produced more than two thirds
of all the wheat grown in the United States,
nearly two thirds of all the corn, nearly half
of all the Irish potatoes, nearly half of all the
beef and stock cattle, and more than one half
of all the sheep and swine. Now, the large
surplus of meat and bread raised in this sec-
tion must in some way find an outlet to mar-
ket. Let us examine a little this surplus.
The wheat produced in these eleven States
amounted, as has been shown, to 200,492,382
bushels. There was in 1870 in these States
a population of 14,302,122; allowing to each
man, woman, and child five bushels of wheat
per year, which is deemed an ample allowance
in a country where corn bread, potatoes, and
other vegetables are used, we have 71,510,010
bushels of wheat for home consumption. This
amount deducted from the whole product of
these States leaves 128,981,772 bushels of wheat
which must seek a market outside of thoso
