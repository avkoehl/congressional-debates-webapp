Supplies captured by General Jackson at Winchester and Martinsburg in May, 1862.

103 head of cattle (gross weight 92,700 pounds), at 7 cents.............................. $6.489 00

14,637 pounds of bacon, at 35 cents..................... 5.122 95

6,000 pounds of hard bread, at 8 cents.................. 480 00

2,400 pounds of sugar, at 35 cents...................... 840 00

350 bushels of salt, at $5.............................. 1.750 00

85 barrels of flour, at $8.............................. 680 00

A large amount of supplies was taken by the troops of General Ewell's and Colonel Ashby's commands from Martinsburg, hauled to their camps, and issued without being receipted for or reported to me. Captain Lock's certificate accompanies this report, showing probable amount received. The contents of four sutlers' stores, filled with a variety of goods, valued at $25,000, for want of transportation, were abandoned to our troops.

W. J. HAWKS,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.

Report of Captain P. J. Lock.

Major Snodgrass, quartermaster for General Ewell's command, informed me that they retained for that command fully 20,000 pounds of bacon and 40,000 pounds of hard bread; also salt, sugar, coffee, and cheese. Captain Richardson, commissary for Colonel Ashby, retained for the cavalry supplies for five or six days - about 7,200 rations.

GENERAL: In response to your inquiry as to the amount of property captured and destroyed from the United States forces under General Banks at Front Royal, in the latter part of May, 1862, I respectfully submit the following:

It is impossible for me to make an accurate estimate of the property captured, owing to the fact that I was only there a part of one day and night, when I was ordered to Winchester, and left Captain S. M. Somers,
