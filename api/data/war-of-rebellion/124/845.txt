It is true that we may be dispensed from bearing arms in procuring substitutes, but we respectfully represent to Your Excellency that individuals in religious orders do not posses anything, and our house cannot possibly procure substitutes for all the priests, clerics, and brothers that will soon be drafted without exposing our establishments in the United States to inevitable ruin.

In consideration of these facts, we are fully confident that your Excellency will grant our petition, and in so doing acquire our lively and eternal gratitude.

With great respect,we are most respectfully, sir, your humble and obedient servants.
