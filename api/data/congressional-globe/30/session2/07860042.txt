APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[Nov. 30j
30th Cong 2d Sess.
Report .of the Commissioner of the General Land Office.
Senate &l Ho. of Reps.
in the aggregate for 1,775,520 acres, have been
located upon lands, and returned to this office, by
the local land officers, for patents.
It will be seen, by the statement of the Adjutant
_ General, dated Aprils, 1848, which was commu-
nicated in a report made to the Senate of the Uni-
ted States by the Secretary of War, on the 8th of
the same month, that the strength of the regular
army, at the commencement of hostilities with
. Mexico in April, 1846, was 7,244 men; that since
the 18th May, 1846,29,000 men have been recruit-
ed, of which 23,556 were sent to Mexico; making
the old army and recruits together amount to
36,244, besides a battalion of marines, composed
of 350 men. There were other recruits after that
time, not mentioned in this statement, which Gen-
eral Jones (the Adjutant General) estimates at
about 5,000 or 6,000; making, altogether, of the
regular army, as nearly as can be ascertained,
40,000 men. Of this number, 35,000 were prob-
ably entitled to "land warrants."
According to the same statement, the volunteer
force enrolled under the act of May 13, 1846, and
the 5th section of the act of March 3,1847, amount-
ed to 56,926 officers and men. General Jones
thinks that a sufficient numbqr of recruits may be
added, which became necessary, from time to
time, to keep up the whole number authorized by
the act of Congress to 50,000 men, to make the
entire number of volunteers equal to about 60,000
• men. Of this number, 55,000 were probably enti-
tled to land warrants : making the whole number
of regulars and volunteers entitled to bounty lands,
about 90,000 men.
The number of warrants issued by the Com-
missioner.of Pensions,"and registered in this office,
up to the 30th of November, 1848, amounts, as
before stated, to 43,174. Now, if this estimate
should prove to be correct, that 90,000 were origi- j
nally entitled to bounty lands, 46,826 warrants |
still remain to be issued.
It is understood that the average number of war-
rants issued by the Commissioner of Pensions per
day is from 150 to 200. At this rate, it will take
about 268 working days to complete the number
still to be issued, if all who are entitled should
apply, (a supposition by no means probable,)
which would make the time still required for this
service about ten months.
I think it not improbable, however, judging
from our past experience, in respect to the " late
war warrants," that from ten to fifteen thousand
(embracing the cases of foreigners who were killed
or died in the service, without relatives in tRis
country, and of heirs, who are frequently ignorant
of their rights) will not be applied for within the
ensuing year, and very many, doubtlesss, will
never be called for at all.
The estimated receipts of cash, on account of
* the sales of the public lands, for the fiscal year
ending 30th June, 1849, are stated at §2,834,700;
and for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1850,
$2,407,500, provided the usual quantity of fiesh
|ands are surveyed and brought into market, ac-
cording to the existing practice of the Govern-
ment.
This supposed falling off in the receipts, as com-
pared with the last year or two, is accounted for
by the fact, that very large amounts of the public
lands are now being located with Mexican war
warrants, instead of money; and so it must be, m
a more or less degree, from year to year, until
these warrants are ail absorbed by locations, and
thus withdrawn from competition in the market.
Prom the best data that can be obtained, it is
estimated that 15,000 warrants, covering 2,400,000
acres, will be located during the balance of the
• current fiscal year; SPnd 25,000 warrants embracing
4.000,000 acres, for the year ending 30th June,
' 1850. These, added to the estimated amount of
cash sales, it will be perceived, will make the esti-
mated aggregates of lands disposed of in each year-
nearly double the usual average, with proper
allowance for increase of population, and the in-
crease of locations consequent upon the reduced
price of these warrants.
The compensation allowed to the district land
officers for their services in the location "of these
warrants, by the act of 17th May, 1848, has been (
found to be wholly inadequate, and many just :
complaintr have been made on this subject. The |i
labor and trouble devolved on those officers, in ||
receiving, noting, registering, and returning those
warrants, is much greater than in receiving, noting,
&,c., an application for an ordinary private .entry.
I would therefore respectfully recommend, thai
the act of 17th May, 1848, above mentioned, be
so amended as to authorize those officers to charge
the same per centage for the location of those war-
rants that they are now allowed by law on cash
entries, retaining the provision, however, that they
shall not be permitted to make any charge in cases
where the warrant is located by, and for the use
! of, the volunteer or soldier to whom such warrant
i may have issued.
| The experience had, since my incumbency of
■ the office I now hold, has convinced me that a
I new arrangement of the duties of this office was
! absolutely necessary, to secure a prompt, efficient,
; and regular discharge of the public business. On
j several occasions, when gentlemen having charge
! of special branches of business, were absent from
! sickness, or for relaxation, necessary alike to the
, health of the officer and the true interests of the
j Government, their duties had to remain unexecu-
j ted till their return. Moreover, it sometimes
I happened, that different branches of the samebusi-
| ness were discharged by different individuals,
! and hence arose a risk of discordant views, and
j conflicting decisions. To obviate these evils, on
j full consideration, I concluded to place the whole
I of the accounting business, including the book-
• keeping, and miscellaneous correspondence con-
| nect^d therewith, under the charge of four of the
i most experienced and competent clerks, giving to
j each a first assistant, *vho could discharge his
! dutes "in case of sickness or absence; and such
j further assistance as the magnitude of his duties
! requited. The transmission of patents, with all
the correspondence connected therewith, was placed
! under the charge of the Recorder. By this means,
the Miscellaneous Bureau has been abolished, the
! force of the office concentrated, and although the
, new system has not been long enough in oper-
! ation to decide finally on its merits, I have no doubt
j that its results will be highly satisfactory, and will
i materially advance the public business, and pro-
! mote the best interests of the office.
Under the act of 9th May, 1848, relative to the
selections for the Wabash and Erie canal in Indiana,
and entitled " An act in addition to an act therein
mentioned," the necessary instructions have been
issued, to enable the trustees of that work to com-
plete the selections authorized by that act.
To carry out the provisions of the second and
third sections of the act of 29th May, 1848, " for
the admission of Wisconsin into the Union," lists
have been prepared of all the sales made within
j the limits of the grant for the Milwaukie and Rock
River canal, showing those at the increased mini-
' mum fixedbytheactof 18th June, 1838. Theselists
have been sent to the land officers at Milwaukie,
i with instructions to compare them with their rec-
j ords, and|to check any errors or omissions that
; may be found in them. When these lists are
returned thus corrected, the lands ill the even-num-
bered sections belonging to the Government, will
i be brought into market at the ordinary minimum,
' as required by the act of 29th May, 1848, above
j mentioned; under the same act, the land officers
! were required to ascertain and report the present
; owners of the lands within the limits of this grant,
j which were purchased at the increased minimum
fixed by the act of 18th June, -1838, that the cer-
tificates for the difference between the minimum of
one dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, and the
price paid for those lands, may be issued to the
present holder of them, as required by the third
section of the act of 1848. ' I
' Diagrams have also been prepared of the grant I
made by the act of 8th August, 1846, to Wiscon- |
sin, on her admission into the Union, for th im- i
provements of the Fox and Wisconsin rivers, and
for connecting the same by a canal. This act is i
manifestly deficient in this, that it grants to the i
State a quantity of land equal to one-half of three
sections in width on each side of Pox river, the !
lakes through which it passes, and the canal.above j
mentioned, but makes no provision as to character I
or locality of the lands that shall- be sefected to 1
supply deficiencies caused by sales and donations '
in the odd-numbered sections within that grant, '
which were made before that act went into opera- j
tion, In the correspondence with the Governor |
on this subject, he has .been authorized to make
selections to supply those deficiencies; and the
land officers have been instructed to reserve all
lands so selected till the final action of Congress
has been had on the subject.
The act of 16th June, 1848, " to attach a portion
of the northwestein land district, in Louisiana to
the district north of Red river in Louisiana" has
been executed, and the plats and records of the
landa thus separated have been transmitted from
the former to the latter office.
Under the act of 1st July, 1848, " for the relief
of the bona fide settlers, under the acts for the
armed occupation and settlement of a part of the
Territory of Florida," an agent was appointed to
repair to Florida, and to obtain the evidence re-
quired by that act. Instructions, full and minute
in every particular, were prepared for this agent,
with records, in which all the cases that had arisen
under the armed occupation acts were entered in
numerical order, with a full history of each, so far
as was shown by the records of this office; and a
blank column left for the decisions of the agent.
The returns of his operations, as far as received,
have been highly satisfactory; and there is every
reason to believe that this long-pending and har-
assing matter will soon be finally disposed of1.

Showing that the aggregate amount to which
said States were originally entitled, under the act
referred to, was 4,166,908 68 acres; the quantity
already selected, located, and approved by the
Secretary of the Treasury, 2,421,722.17 acres; the
quantity selected, but the locations of which have
been suspended for further examination, 3Bl,3f9.99
acres; and the quantity to which said States are
yet entitled, on the 30th of November, 1848,
1,745,186.51 acres, including the cases of location
held up for further examination, and which have
not been approved by the Secretary of the Treas-
ury.
It may not be improper to remark, in connection
with this subject, that by an act of Congress passed
on the 11th of August, 1845, the State of Alabama
is authorized to locate the quantity of land to
which that State is yet entitled, in legal subdivis-
ions of not less than forty acres each, with the
privilege of selling the same, when thus located,
for the use of schools within the townships of said
State, at such prices as the Legislature may direct.
The other States are required, by the act of Sep-
tember 4,1841, to locate "in parcels, conformably
' to sectional divisions and subdivisions, of not
| 1 less than 320 acres in any one location."
VIII.—Suspended Entries.
Prior to th4 expiration of the act of 3d of Au-
! gust, 1846, in relation to suspended entries of land
i in this office, it was discovered that other and
i pressing duties would have to be neglected, or
; they would prevent a due examination, within the
I time limited by the act)(of many cases of preemp-
