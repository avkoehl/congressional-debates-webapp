Mr. EDMUNDS. I ask that the amendment
to which the House does not agree be read.
The Secretary read the amendment, which
was on page 8, line eleven, after the word
"Sandusky" to insert " harbor, bay, and."
Mr. EDMUNDS. Let the context be read
to show the application of the amendment.
The Secretary. The clause in the bill
reads, "for improvement of Sandusky river,
from Fremont to lake Erie, $20,000." The
amendment of the Senate is to insert after the
word "Sandusky" the words "harbor, bay,
and;" so that it will read : "for improvement
of Sandusky harbor, bay, and river from Fr6-
mont to lake Erie, $20,000."

suspension op joint rules.
Mr. FESSENDEN submitted the following
resolution; which was considered by unanimous
consent, and agreed to :
Resolved, (the House of Representatives concurr-
ing. > That the sixteenth and seventeenth joint rules
of the two Houses be suspended for tho residue of the
session.
The sixteenth and seventeenth joint rules
are:
"16. No bill that shall have passed one House shall
be sent to the other on either of the last three days
of the session.
"17. No bill or resolution that shall have passed the
House of Representatives and the Senate shall be
presented to tho President of tho United States for
his approbation on the last day of tho session."
duties on wool and woolens.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move to discharge the
Committee on Finance from the further con-
, sideration of House bill No. 793, which is
entitled "A bill to provide increased revenue
from imported wool, and for other purposes."
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. The bill being now before
the Senate, I propose to offer an amendment to
it, striking out all after the enacting clause,
and inserting what I send to the desk. I will
i state that the bill itself is a bill which was
passed by the House of Representatives at the
last session, proposing to increase the duties
1 on wool and woolen goods to correspond with
, the House tariff bill on that subject. I propose
now, by direction of the Committee on Finance,
to amend it by striking out all after the enact-
ing clause and inserting the precise phraseology
adopted in the Senate bill on that subject. As
this question has already been gone over in
detail, and is fully understood, I think we can
act upon it aftd take the vote at once.
The PRESIDENTpro tempore. It is moved
that the Senate now proceed to the considera-
tion of the bill from the consideration of which
the Committee on Finance has just been dis-
charged, and in connection with that subject
the Senator from Ohio offers an amendment to
the bill.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Is that in order?
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The first
question is, Will the Senate now proceed to
consider the bill?
Mr. GRIMES. I inquire whether the Sen-
ator from Ohio proposes that we shall proceed
with the consideration of this bill without hav-
ing it printed or knowing anything about it?
Mr. SHERMAN. It is printed. The Sen-
ator has a printed bill on his files word for
word just what this is. We have not varied it.
Mr. GRIMES. Printed in what form ?
Mr. SHERMAN. Printed in the form in
which it came to us from the House, and
printed in the precise form which I now offer.
Mr. GRIMES. What I want to know is, in
what shape the Senator offers a substitute for
the House bill.
Mr. SHERMAN. That is printed precisely
as I offer it.
Mr. GRIMES. When was it printed ?
Mr. SHERMAN. It was printed the other
day. I offer precisely the wool part of the
tariff bill as we passed it some weeks ago. It
was printed by the House precisely as we sent
it to them. The Senator can send a page to
the document-room and get a copy of it.
Mr. GRIMES. I think it would be well
enough for us to be able to understand what
this thing is before we are called upon to act
ort it. I have not seen the bill which the Sen-
ator proposes as a substitute, and I do not know
anything about it. I had no idea that any such
proposition as this was going to be made.
Mr. SHERMAN. When the bill is taken
up I will explain it so that every Senator will
have no trouble in knowing all about it.
_Mr. GRIMES. I have no doubt the Senator
will explain it very satisfactorily to himself and
those who maybe in favor of the proposition,
and perhaps I may be in favor of it eventu-
ally; but I should like to see the proposition
before me so that I can judge for myself.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will tell the Senator
precisely the history of it, if it is in order for
me to do so now. The House of Represent-
atives at the last session sent us a general tariff
