HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 12, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER, Stevenson:

Can you have ready a column of one division to move up to Shellmound and push an advance brigade to Whiteside's, to start to daylight in the morning? They can take ten days' rations in haversack and knapsack. Answer. Any news from the cavalry?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, ALA., October 12, 1863.

(Received 2 a.m., 14th.).

To the PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:*

Permit me to make a suggestion with reference to my command. After your conversation with Meade I make it with great delicacy. It is that General Slocum may be tendered a command in Missouri or somewhere else. General Rosecrans has not acted on your letter, and from the position of his troops I do not see how he can do it at present. I suggest this as the choice of evils. If telegraphed to from Washington I have no doubt but that he will jump at an opportunity to accept. Unless he gives more satisfaction in the discharge of his duties, he will soon find himself in deeper water than he has been wading in.

I shall act very deliberately with him. I will incur reproach if I allow the public interest to suffer by his contumacy. He now appears to be swayed entirely by passion in the exercise of his office. I hear that his grievances are hostility to myself association with the Eleventh Coprs, an disrespect shown his rank in detailing him for this service. It seems that he aspired to the command of the Army of the Potomac, and that mortal offense was given in not naming him first. Of these you probably know more than myself. I should rejoice to have the Twelfth Corps put in Buttefield's hands.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

STEVENSON, October 12, 1863-7.45 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I can do it, but only with infantry. I should prefer to have a battery to accompany the column, but as the horses have but just arrived, I doubt if they will be in readiness that early. Not a syllable from the cavalry to-day.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 12, 1863.

Major-General HOOKER, Stevenson:

I will delay the order till your batteries are ready. Hasten their preparation and report when ready. The object is to get possession of the line of the river up to this place.
