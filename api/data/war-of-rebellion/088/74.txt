Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following dispatches were received an hour since, but delayed until I could ascertain the probable number and direction of the moving column:

WALTHALL HOUSE STATION.

The enemy's signal officer reports movements of a four-gun battery near Battery Numbers 5 going toward our front; the battery is probably Captain Ashby's (Battery E, Third New York). A column of infantry is moving on the Richmond road. Will report more definitely in a short time.

C. L. DAVIS,

Captain and Signal Officer.

The column of infantry reported moving toward the right was an hour and a half passing a point on the Richmond road, north 40 degrees west from here, and was followed by upward of thirty wagons. The rear of the train passed at 10.30.

C. L. DAVIS,

Captain and Signal Officer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.

Probably a division of infantry going to the enemy's pontoon bridge over the James.

Thirty more wagons have just passed the same point on Richmond rod by which the column of infantry marched, moving to the right. About thirty-five cavalrymen just passed the open space back of Whitehead's Factory, going toward the city.
