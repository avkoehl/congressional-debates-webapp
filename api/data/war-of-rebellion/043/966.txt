The charge of the First New Jersey in rear of the house I led in person, aided by Lieutenant-Colonel Brodrick. At the first onset the enemy were driven from their guns, the support coming up was met, and in a few minutes also driven back. Re-enforced, it returned and was again repulsed. My command being now much scattered by the charges it had made, Colonel Duffie not coming up to my support as I expected, and seeing the enemy, strongly re-enforced, advancing from several points, I was compelled to withdraw. This was done by the greater part of the command forming on the Brandy Station road, while I collected the balance at the station, and, forming them into a rear guard, remained until the lines twice, but were repulsed each time by my carbineers with heavy loss. While engaged here, I received a bullet in the leg. After joining the balance of my command, I reported to the general commanding, and received orders to move to the right. Forming my command near-Church, I remained until about 4 o'clock in the afternoon, when, becoming very much exhausted from the loss of blood, I turned over the command to Colonel J. P. Taylor, of the First Pennsylvania Reserve Cavalry, and left the field. He reports that shortly afterward he received orders to report to General Buford, and assisted in covering the withdrawal of his command across the river. In closing my report, if affords me no small degree of pleasure be able to say that all my command that followed me on the field behaved nobly, standing unmoved under the enemy's artillery fire, and when ordered to charge, dashing forward with a spirit and determination that swept all before them. I cannot speak too highly of the manner in which the field officers of my command, without exception, acted, gallantly and efficiently performing every duty assigned them; and of the line officers I can say the same. Major Janeway, who was doing duty as field-officer of the day, and Captain H. S. Thomas, assistant inspector-general; Lieutenant William P. Lloyd, acting assistant adjutant -general; Lieutenant S. Greenlee(wounded), and Lieutenant[Edwin H.]Parry, acting aides-de-camp, of my staff, all rendered invaluable service by the prompt and efficient manner in which they had my orders executed, and the assistance they afforded in rallying and reforming the different portions of the command. As a brief summary, I may add that six distinct regimental charges were made, besides a number of smaller ones. We took one battle flank, captured 128 of the enemy, among whom were General Stuart's adjutant-general, and several other officers whose rank was not learned. The section of artillery attacked to my command was well handled and did good execution. One piece burst while firing, and was left; the other was brought off. My loss is 1 officer killed and 14 wounded of missing; 14 men killed and 120 wounded or missing. *A list of the casualties accounted for by name will accompany this report.
