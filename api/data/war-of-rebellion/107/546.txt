Governor CHASE,

Secretary of the Treasury;

General Lander died at 5 o'clock this afternoon without suffering. I should regret that so firm and valiant a friend heard the sad news from any one but.

S. F. BARSTOW.

This command, on the death of General Lander, was turned over to me, and I have assumed command and await the arrival of General Shields and your further orders.

WASHINGTON, March 3, 1862.

Colonel N. KIMBALL,

Fourteenth Indiana, Paw Paw:

I yesterday sent orders to Captain Barstow for your command to move at once, via Hedgesville, on Martinsburg, which is already occupied by our troops. Carry out this order at once, leaving in your rear sufficient guards to cover reconstruction of railroad. It is of the first importance that your command should reach Martinsburg with least possible delay. General Shields will join there. Be sure to cover the railway, but advance the mass of your troops to Martinsburg without waiting for its completion.

GEO. B. MCCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

[5.]

WHEELING, VA., March 3, 1862-10 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel A. V. COLBURN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch received. General Schenck ordered to assume command at Cumberland and report condition of troops without delay. Will report to General-in-Chief as directed. Say to him failure of telegraph lines from Fayette with information prevented report on Big Sandy as promised.

W. S. ROSECRANS.
