order, except my dragoons, who were completely stampeded several times. I continued my retreat to this place, which is 26 miles from Fredericton. I will leave here at 12 o'clock to go to Greenville, and then shape my course by the circumstances which arise.

Major Shallhas been hovering on the south side of Ironton, with 250 dragoons and 100 Missourians, to assist me, but to-day I have received a dispatch from him that his duty impels him to return to Pitman's Ferry, to prepare to defend that post, which will be 50 miles in my rear, if I can maintain myself at Greenville. I hope you will send a few regiments over into Stoddard County, to encourage the people, as they may be discouraged by my defeat. I will give you a detailed report of the whole expedition as soon as I reach a permanent camp.*

Yours, most respectfully,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

CAMP GREENVILLE,

October 23, 1861 - 7 o'clock p. m.

SIR: I have just been informed that the enemy in strength, say 5,000 men, are in 20 miles of me, with the intention of following me to Pitman's Ferry. I will start immediately, and go to Bloomfield, as I mentioned in my letter of yesterday, and if the forces I have asked are sent me, I think I can prevent their return to Ironton.

Activity will now accomplish much, and I hope to have your assistance. I will send you information constantly, and if the enemy return, you shall know it. They will try, i expect, to take Bloomfield, and I wish your troops there to disappoint them.

Yours, most respectfully,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General POLK.

BLOOMFIELD,

Friday, October 25, 1861 - 7 o'clock p. m.

SIR: I reached here an hour ago, having left my command at Saint Francisville. From what I can hear to-day the enemy have not followed up their intentions of pursing us, and have returned to the line from Cape Girardeau to Ironto. I have a splendid position for defense or unexpected sortie, and by Monday I hope to begin another march after them if my horses are enough rested. My deserters have mostly come in, and I have more men, and in better spirits, now than ever before, although I did not get as many as I expected in the upped counties, on account of the scarcity of guns. The troops stationed at Pitman's Ferry have not acted with the gallantry they should have. My adjutant will made a detailed statement as soon as possible. Let me know by courier if any re-enforcements have been sent me, so that I may make by arrangements accordingly.

Yours, most respectfully,

M. JEFF. THOMPSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major General LEONIDAS POLK, C. S. A., Columbus, Ky.
