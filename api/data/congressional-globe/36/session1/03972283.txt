I now move that the committee rise and report
the bill to the House.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed the chair, Mr. John- Cochrane re-
ported that the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union had, according to order, had
the Union generally under consideration, and par-
ticularly the bill of the House, No. 330, making
appropriations for the legislative, executive, and
judicial expenses of Government for the year
ending 30th"of June, 1861; and had instructed him
to report the same to the House, with sundry
amendments, in which he was instructed to ask
the concurrence of the House.
Mr. SHERMAN. I demand the previous ques-
tion upon the bill and amendments.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put.
Mr. SHERMAN. I believe I am entitled to
an hour to close debate upon this bill. I propose,
however, to detain the House only for two or
three minutes, for the purpose of calling the at-
tention of the House to two or three amendments
which have been adopted by the Committee of
the Whole, and particularly to the amendment
offered by the gentleman from Georgia, [Mr.
CitAwroRD,] striking out the miscellaneous fund
for the House, and that offered by the gentleman
from Kentucky, [Mr. Burnett,) in reference to
the binding of the Congressional Globe. That
offered by the gentleman from Georgia is to strike
out the entire miscellaneous fund of the House.
Mr. CRAWFORD. Only one half of it. I
propose to make the miscellaneous fund $20,000,
instead of $40,000.
Mr. SHERMAN. I desire to say that in the
last session a similar motion was made by the
gentleman from North Carolina, [Mr. Vance.]
The amount then reported was $40,000. My
friend from Georgia then opposed the amendment,
and the motion to strikeout was not carried. The
amount expended, however, cxcecdcd the amount
appropriated, and we were compelled to supply
a deficiency of some $10,000 in the deficiency bill.
When the motion was made by the gentleman
from North Carolina to strike out that clause in
the bill, my friend from Georgia made a speech,
which is reported in the Congressional Globe,
against striking out. I will not detain the House
by reading it.
I will state, however, that this $40,000 covers
a multitude of little items, such as the funeral ex-
penses of members and a thousand things which
are contained in this large volume containing u
statement of the expenditure of the contingent
fund. Forty thousand dollars is the amount ap-
propriated for this purpose for the last four or five
years, and it has been found too small. I there-
fore hope the House, when they come to vote
upon that amendment, will not adopt it.
In regard to the other amendment, proposed hy
the gentleman from Kentucky, who proposed to
require that the bindingof the Congressional Globe
should he done by the publisher of the Globe at
a price, 1 believe, not exceeding sixty-three cents,
I will state that it has been the custom for many
ycais for the Clerk of the House to do this bind-
ing, or to have it done under the direction of the
Committeeof Accounts. If we adopt this amend-
ment we give the binding to Mr. Rives without
any control of the Committee of Accounts or
anybody else. Now, sir, I will say that the Clerk
of the House has already contracted for doing
this binding at sixty cents per volume, which is
less than it is proposed to pay Mr. Rives. Every
gentleman who has noticed the binding of our
documents which have been done this session
will concur with me that it has been well done,
much better than it has been done by Mr. Rives.
But, sir, I do not propose to detain the House.
I only call the attention of the House to these
amendments, so that they may not be taken by
surprise.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I desire to
ask the gentleman from Ohio if he proposes to
close debate upon the next bill to be taken up in
committee?
Mr. SHERMAN. I do, in five minutes after
we resume the consideration of it in committee.
Mr, WASHBURNE,'of Illinois, I merely de-
sire to say that I wish to improve an early oppor-
tunity of saying something in vindication of a
distinguished citizen of my State, who is a candi-
date for the Presidency, and who is to be the next
President. [Laughter.]
Mr. SHERMAN. I would suggest that my
friend will have ample time to do that upon the
stump.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I desire to
do it for the purpose of stating some of his con-
gressional history, which I see has already been
grossly misrepresented. I see it has been sta-
ted he voted against the war with Mexico, against
supplies, and everything of that kind.
Mr. BRANCH. I rise to a quesrtion oforder
This course of debate is, of course, not in order.
Mr. FLORENCE. If the gentleman from Illi-
nois keeps on he will very soon have all his spcech
made.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. If the gen-
tleman will hear me, I will get through in one
moment.
Mr. BRANCH. I must object. I make the
point of order that the remarks indulged in by
the gentleman are not in order; and I insist that
he cannot proceed, whether the gentleman from
Ohio yields to him or not.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I give no-
tice, thatwhen the House again resolves itself into
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, I will seek an opportunity to make the re-
marks which I have referred to.
Mr. CRAWFORD. Whilewe werein the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the stateof theUnion yes-
terday evening, I moved to strike out the $40,000
appropriation referred to, and to insert in lieu of
it an appropriation of §20,000. The appropria-
tion for $40,000 was recommended by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means.
Now, the chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Means has turned to some remarks which I
submitted on this subject during the last session.
My remarks are reported correctly. 1 sanctioned
then the necessity for the increase of the appro-
priation to $40,000. The question with the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means on that appropriation
was in regard to the proposed increase from
$30,000 to $40,000. The gentleman from North
Carolina [Mr. Vance] rose and inquired the rea-
son for that increase. It was in reply to that in-
quiry, in explanation of that increase of $10,000,
that my remarks were made. At this session,
when the item for $40,000 was presented to the
Committee of Ways and Means, I asked to know
for what it was to ue expended. I submit that it
cannot be shown that there will be a disburse-
ment^ §40,000, or of even half that sum.
Since I made my remarks at the last session,
this House, out of the appropriation then made,
has had every necessary article of furniture fur-
nished; the desks have been removed, and these
benches placed in their stead; the committee-
rooms and the cloak-rooms have all been provided
for; and every department about the Capitol has
been furnished with all the articles required. Not-
withstanding that, we are now asked to appropri-
ate $40,000 for the next short session. The usual
appropriation has been §40,000 for a long session,
and $30,000 for a short session. 1 cannot see any
propriety in appropriating this large sum for a
short session.
It "vvas objected, last year, by the gentleman
from North Carolina, as entirely too large a sum
even for a long session. The ^'20,000 I have pro-
posed is more than enough for the purpose indi-
cated. Take your committee-rooms; take this
end of the Capitol; take every article of furniture
about it, and all is paid for. If they are not all
paid for, what is not paid for is provided for ill
another bill than tins. There is not a single article
of furnituic supplied to the House of Representa-
tives which is included by this appropriation of
£40,000. I called upon the Clerk to know the
reason for this appropriation of$40,000. Certain
incidental expenses were referred to about bring-
ing witnesses here; that the Sergeant-at-Arms
had to be paid, and bo on. We have provided for
