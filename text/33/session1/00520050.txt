Dec. 15,
COMMUNICATIONS FROM STATE DEPART-
MENT.
Mr.HOUSTON. Althoughitis late,I move 
The SPEAKER. If the gentleman from Ala-
bama will allow the Chair, he will present to the
House a communication from the State Depart-
ment.
Mr. HOUSTON. I yield for that purpose.
The SPEAKER then presented the communi-
cation from the Department ofState, in obedience
to the twentieth section ofthe act entitled "An act
legalizing and making appropriations for such
necessary objects as have usually been included in
the general appropriation bills withoutauthority of
law, and to fix and provide for certain incidental
expenses of the Departments and offices of the
Government, and for other purposes," approved
the 26th of August, 1842; and the act making ap-
propriations/or the civil and diplomatic expenses
of Government, for the year 3836, (section 2.)
Mr. BAYLY, of Virginia, moved that the com-
munication be referred to the Committee on For-
eign Affairs, and be printed; which motion was
1 to.
CODIFICATION OF REVENUE LAWS.
Mr. CURTIS. Is it in order to make a motion
to proceed to the business upon the Speaker's
table ?
The SPEAKER. It is in order.
Mr. CURTIS. Then I make the motion.
The question was put, and the motion was
agreed to.
Joint resolution (No. 1.) from the Senate,
authorizing the Secretary of the Treasury to pay
the expenses of codifying and revising the reve-
nue laws, was then taken up from the Speaker's
table, and read the first and second time by its
title.
Mr. CURTIS. I will state the object of the
resolution.
The SPEAKER. Under the rules this resolu-
tion must go to the Committee of the Whole
House on the state of the Union, unless the rules
be dispensed with by unanimous consent.
Mr. CURTIS. The individual selected for
the work of codifying and revising the revenue
laws has performed a considerable portion of the
duties assigned Inm. At the last session of Con-
gress, when this office was created, a bill passed
both Houses making an appropriation for the ser-
vices to be performed. That bill, unfortunately,
in some way, was lost, and does not appear in
the printed laws. My object is to carry out the
provision passed at the last session making the
appropriation, in compliance with the act which
created the office, and under which the work has
been commenced and nearly completed.
Mr. LETCHER. How much will it cost ?
Mr. CURTIS. The amount named in the res-
olution is ten thousand dollars.
Mr. LETCHER. How much more will it
take ?
Mr. CURTIS. I think the amount required
will be about that sumâ€”not any more. It is sup-
posed that the work will be finished by the first of
April next.
The SPEAKER. Is it the pleasure of the
House that this resolution shall be considered at
this time ?
Mr. WHEELER. I object.
Mr. CURTIS. The resolution merely provides
for an omission made at the last session of Con-
fress. I hope that the gentleman will withdraw
is objection.
The SPEAKER. The Chair holds, if objec-
tion be made, that the resolution, under the rules
of the House, cannot be considered at this time,
but must first go to the Committee of the Whole.
Is it the pleasure of the House that the bill should
be referred to the Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union?
There being no objection, it was so ordered.
Mr. HOUSTON. I desire that the House
would indulge me in the suspension of the rules,
that we may go into the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union, for the purpose of enter-
ing upon and referring the President's message.
I do not suppose that we shall remain long in
session this evening; but it is well known to those
who have served long here, that it is important we
should go into the Committee of the Whole early
in the session, and get organized there for business
hereafter. I therefore make the motion that the
rules be suspended, and that the House resolve
itself into the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union.
Mr. MEACHAM. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
The question was taken, and the motion was
agreed to; and
The House adjourned till to-morrow at twelve
o'clock, m.
