FORT SCOTT, April 11, 1865 - 10 p. m.

Major-General DODGE:

I am apprised of the movements of the rebel forces about which Colonel Ford telegraphed you on the 9th. There were 600 at the junction of Whitewater and Walnut, part of Stand Watie's command. This may be only the advance of a larger force, or it may be all there is of it. If the latter, they can accomplish nothing. I have had 200 men in that country for several days; started sixty more yesterday. am issuing 150 horses to-day, which were received yesterday, and shall start myself with these to-morrow. It will take all day to get the men in from the outposts and the horses issued. Some of my outposts are twenty-two miles off.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel.

Colonel BLAIR:

Have you heard anything further from Stand Watie's forces? Answer.

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT SCOTT, KANS., April 11, 1865.

Major-General BLUNT, Paola, Kans.:

Nothing further, except that Colonel Ford has been telegraphing to Major-General Dodge on the same subject. I started out sixty men of the Fifteenth [Kansas] yesterday. I start myself to-morrow with the Third Wisconsin Cavalry and one 6-pounder field piece. As I leave almost nothing here, I hope you will send forward that infantry as soon as you get control of it.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel.

Yes; just received it a few moments after I wrote my last telegram.
