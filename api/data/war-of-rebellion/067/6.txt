May 19, 1864 - 1 p. m. (Received 5.35 p. m.)

I shall make a flank movement early in the morning and try to reach Bowling Green and Milford Station. If successful, Port Royal will be more convenient as a depot than Fredericksburg. I wish you would stir up the navy and see if they cannot reach there.

(Received 1 a. m., 20th.)

The enemy came out on our right late this afternoon and attacked, but were driven back until some time since dark. Not knowing their exact position, and the danger our trains at Fredericksburg will be in if we move, I shall not make the move designated for to-night their designs are fully developed. We captured men from three different divisions of the enemy; all from Ewell's corps.

In the Field, May 20, 1864 - 8.30 a. m.

(Received 4 p. m.)

The attempt to turn our right last evening was by Ewell's corps wholly. They were promptly repulsed by Birney's and Tyler's divisions and some of Warren's troops that were on the extreme right. About 300 prisoners fell into our hands, besides many killed and wounded. Our loss foots up a little over 600 wounded and about 150 killed and missing. This is as near an accurate report as can be given at this time. Probably the killed and missing is overstated.
