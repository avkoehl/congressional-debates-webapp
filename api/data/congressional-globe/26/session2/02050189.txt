with the convenience of the members the information of the
community the economy of time and money and the chaiactei
of the country, they have given it alt the consideration which
their othei engagements pe-nntted
' Under ali c lcumstances the committee have deemed it then
duty to recomí lend that a tariff of prices for ev ery kind of print
mg required to be done for Congress; be fixed by a joint íes lu
non of the two Houses to contitue in force foi two yeais and
that before the close of the piesei   session, each House make
fc choiceby ballot of a printer to execute its own work dur ng the
next Congress The prices should be adeq late to ¡he emj ioy
ment of sufficient capital and workmen to pel foi m th work ex
peditiouslj and to ensure such care and attention as shall give it
sue i a degree of accuracy and elegance as shall not dtshoroi the
literature and typography of the corntry With former con
tracts before us and with the professional knowledge which
may be called m aid no difficulty would occur m foiming tie
tariff alluded to on principles at once liberal to the prmtei and
advantageous to Congress and in the selection of its pnntei
each House would doubtlegb take especial caie to choose a man
of capacity piobity,andiet=ponsib lity In addition to the bond
and security tobe lequned of them foi the faithful performance
* of then obligations a provision might be added, that m case of
any umeasonable delay another person might be eti ployed to
do the work at such a price as the Secretary or the Clerk might
be able to get it done for and that the Public Printer shou d
respectively, be responsib'e foi any difference betwe n the sum
allowed them, and that which it might be necessary to give
him '
Here, then, we have the report of this commit-
tee, and there is no escape Ircm it—there is no
chance for cavil <r for ¡nisrep e*entation Trey
distinctly recommend in tueir report that eaeh
House, before the close of the present session,
(1819,) make choice by ballot of a Printer to ex
ecute its own work during the next Congress
They regard, in their report, most clearly, as they
well might, the Public Punteras the mere mecha
meal instrument to execute the public printing for
Congress agreeably to the mode which should be
directed by law    In perfect accordarce with  the
spirit and letter of the report, the joint resolution of
March, 1819, was introduced, and, after debate,
adopted—a resolution not merely of the Sena e,but
a resolution which was passed wuh all the forms
and  sanctions of law     It passed *he Senate, it
parsed the Hous-  and was approve! by the Pred
dent, and anless it wab in violation of ¡he C msti
tation.it was as binding, as obligatory upon sub-
sequent Congresses as any act upon  the statute
book.    So long as it existed as the law of the land,
so long was it to be respected and observed.    And
what was this i esolution, whtch is now discovered
to have been passed in disregard of the Constitu
lion, and in violation of the rights of the succeed-
ing Congress?   As I have before said, the resolu-
tion which was adopted March 3, 1819, contained
provisions directing the mode and manner of exe-
cuting the public printing, and fixed ¡he compensa-
tion to be paid therefor, and that part of the joint
resolution is now considered as obligatory    I have  ,
omitted to extract all that part of the resolution,  !
and have only subjoined what I regard as material  '
to the question before the Senate    It declares
"That as soon as this resolution shall have been approved
by the President of the United States, each House shall proceed
to ballot for a Printer to execute its work dur ng the next Con
gress, and the person having the greatest number of votes shall
be considered duly elected, and shall give bond with sureties, to
the satisfaction of" the Secretary of the Senate and Clerk of the
House  f Representatives, respectively, for the prompt, accu
rate, and neat execution of the work "
Nothing could be more distinctly stated—nothing
could more clearly define the duty of a Congress
about to terminate It imposed upon it the obliga-
tion to elect by ballot a Printer to execute printing
for the next Congress.
It has been questioned whether this resolution
required that the Congress about to terminate
should elect a Printer for the next Congress, but is
there any room for a doubt? As soon "as the
resolution shall have been approved by the Presi-
dent of the United States, each House shall pro-
ceed to ballot for a Printer for the next Congress "
What resolution was to be approved? Clearly, the
resolution wmch the Congress then in session was
competent to pass Tnat Congress was about to
terminate -^It had passed a resolution, with all the
forms and sanctions of law, directing the mode and
manner lor executing the public printing, and for
fixing the rate of compensation, and it required
that as soon as the resolution shall be approved,
each House shall proceed to the election of Printer
to execute the public printing. It is idle to sup-
pose that the then President of the Untied States
could then approve of any resolution except it
were passed by that Congress Tne resolution
was passed by both Houses of Congress, and w?s
approved by th¿ PresiJent on t?e third of March,
1819, and m the evemrg of that sam  day the two
Houses proceeded to the election of a Printer to
execute the prmt ng for the next Congress, accord
mg to the existing provisions of law
The report of the joint committee, and the joint
resolution of Congress, alike express that the pur
pose was to correct an existing evil in the mode of
executing the public printing, and if th°re c iuld
possibly be any room for doubt as to tne terms of
ihe joint íesolution itself, would it not be f^ir trd
even concljsive to refer to the action of Congress
upon the adoption cf lhat resolution Many of
those wno were the active member  of Congress m
1819, at the time of the adoption of the joint reso
lution, were also membeis ot the sub equent Con-
gre s, and must have perfectly well understood the
whole object a"d character of the resolution, and
if there cc uld have been any conceivable objec
Hon in a corstitutiocal point of view, it would
have been then urged But so far from it, history
gives evidence lhat from that time to the present
there has not been the slightest departure from th 
letter of the joint resolution It appears lhat on
the 31 of March, 1819, both Houses of Congress,
in pursuance of the joint resolution of the same
date, proceeded to the election of Public Printer to
execute the public printing agreeably to the
provisions of ihe said joint resolution. Gales
and Seaton were elected, and on the third of
March, 1821, m exact conformity to the
joint resolution, each House proceeded to elect
a Public Primer for the next Congress
Agitm Gales and Seaton were elec ed, and on
February 7, l-)23, in obedience to the joint resolu
tion of 1819 each House -gam elected a Pubic
Prtnler for the next Congress Gales and Seaton
were elee'ed, and m 1825, each House, in obe
dtonce to the jomf resolution of 1819, elected Gales
and Seaton Public Printers for tbe succeeding Con-
gress Prom 1819 to the close ot tbe 18th Con-
gress (in 1825) there was not the least diversity oí
opinion as 10 the obligatory character of the joint
re olution of 1819 Certain the fact is, that both
Houses of Congress, up to that t me, faithfully car-
ried out, as far as they could, that resolution,
and during the whole of that period from 1819 to
1825, I have not been able to find the expression
of an opinion against the constitutional posver
of Congress to pass the j mt resolution of 1819
But this is not all From that period to this there
has not been any departure in practice from the
resolution of 1819 In 1827 the Senate elected
Duff Green the Public Printer for the next
Congress And it so turns out, upon examina-
tion, that in no instance since the adoption of the
joint resolution of 1819, has the Senate of the
United States doubted its obligatory character—tn
no instance have they disregarded i s provisions, and
shall it now be said that this resolution ¡s not obli-
gatory? Shall it now be said that the Senate may
or may notobserve the directions of that resolution,
according to its own will and p'easure? Has it
not received a construction, by the invariable use
of the Senate, which we are not at liberty to disre-
gard? Is it not out bottnden duty to go back to the
period of its adoption, and trace tbe action of the
Senate from that time to the present, and judge
whether, in its origin, as well as m its execution,
any question has been raised as to its Unding and
obligatory force?
In 1829, Congress, by the same foims and sanc-
tions of law, pa«sed a resolution amendatory of tbe
resolution of 1819 But it should be borne in mind
that it does not repeal any of the provisions cf that
resolution, save those which are inconsistent with
the resolution of 1829, and what are ihey?
Merely changing the result of the election from
a plurality to a majority of votes, and also pro-
viding that the election should be held within thirty
days previous to the termination of every Congress.
The mode and the manner of executing the public
printing, and the prices paid therefor, are not at all
affected by the amendatory resolution of 1829.
They remain unchanged to this day, and by all
parties have been, from that time to this, re-
garded as obligatory That is, if a Printer shall
be elected to-day, in pursuance of the joint resolu-
tion of 1829j he js to execute the public printing
according to the mode, and for tbe sam  compensa-
tion, prescribed by the resolution of 1819 In or-
der lhat there may be a perfect understanding of
this whole matter, I have subjoined an exact copy
ot the re olu'ion o 1839 1 have done this that
the people may understand this subject, and be able
to judge whether the nexi Senate has the power to
set at nought ihe act of ihe present Congress, and
to nunify the ¡aw of the land The resolution is as
follows
' Revolted by the Senate and House of Representatives
of the United states of Amencazv Congress assembled, That,
within thirty da>¡> 1 efore the adjournment of every Congress,
each House shall pioceed to vote for a Printer to execute its
work for and dunn^ the succeeding Congress and the person
having the majority of all the votes given shall be considered
duly elected and bat so much of the reso ution, approved file
third day ol March ore thousand eight hundred and nme
teen entitled A resolution directing the manner m which, the
printing of Confess shall be executed ñx f g the puces thereof,
and piovidmg for the appointment of a Printer or Printers,'
as is altered by this resol t tion, be and the same is hereby, re
scinded '
Such has been the legislation of Congress, and I
have slated that the unitorm usage, the invaria-
ble practice of the Senate has been to carry out
that legis'a ion Not only have those reselu-
tions received the sanction of thf Senate by their
conforming lo their requirements, but m 1835 the
ques icn was distinctly presented to the Senate.
The subject was fully considered and fully debated
And, sir, what was ihe result' Every pohucul
friend of ibe Senator from Connecticut so voted as
to ¡jive an oblita ory and binding force to the reso-
lutions cf 1819 and of 1829 I am aware thatmy
own political fnenas at that time tot k a different
view ut the matitr, bu' the result of that contro-
versy was, as I have sta ed, that the vole of the
m jorit/ f f toe Serate went to sanction the res>olu-
tit ns of 1819 and cf 1829 And that majority was
made up by gentleTen now members ot ihts Se-
na'e, who ate among the poln cal associates and
friends oí the Senator from Connecticut, and the
result of that controversy was to elect Gales and
Seaton as Public Printers for ihe then next Con-
gress
It i" ttue, that af er tbe 18 h ballot, Mr. Wwoht
moved to postpone the further balloting to the
next session of Congres , and he and his friends
voted lor ihe motion, but the friends of ihe Sena-
tor from Connect cut, being in the majority, voted
agai'st the motion And I infer from this fact,
that a construction has been solemnly given to ihe
joint resolutions of 1819 and of 1829 which we
are not at liberty now to disregard. And, sir, we
have not only the resolutions themselves, which
every man who will read must admit are m terms
imperative, but we have the invariable practice of
the Senate, from 1819 to the present day, in strict
conformity to the letter of those resolutions, and
we have also ihe solemn, deliberate decision of the
Senate in 1835, when the direct question was pre-
sented, that the resolutions were obligatory, that
the Senate could not disregard them, and the elec-
tion took place accordingly, and ihe subsequent
Congress acquiesced in that election, although at the
commencement of thesecond session of that Congress
the majority of the Senate was politically opposed to
the Public Printers. Yet their election was ne«er
questioned—the party then in power acquiesced—
they considered the question settled by the previous
decsion of the Senate, and they acquiesced, with-
out a complaint, to the execution of the public
priEting, through ihe who'e of that Congress, com-
mencing in March, 1835, and ending m March,
1837, by Gales and S «ton. And will the Senator
from Connecticut, after all this history, undertake
to say that the joint resolutions of 1819 and of
1829 are not to be regarded as obligator)? I should
like, after what has taken place, to see some of the
friends of tbe Senator undertake to set aside any
election which mav now take place in obedience to
the resolutions of 1819 and 1829 No, sir. It may
. be well to deal out this language of menace.
It is one thing to tay, and another thing to do.
There exis's too much record touching this matter
to induce me to believe for a moment that the Se-
nator hims lf will be found amoi g those who seek
to nullify any proceeding of the Senate whichjnay
now take place. In my judgment, it will BOt be
done. And why do I so saj? Because- the active
and political friends of the Senator from 181/9 to
the presem day hare justly and properly eo teurje4
