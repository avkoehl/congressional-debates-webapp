CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
«f the alteration of this fond, and the gentleman from Kentucky
Contended that it of right belonged to the States and if the mat-
ter could be brought before a Court of Chancery, it would
award it to them Now, he apprehended that it was a well es
tabijshed proposition, known in private life, that the credit of
an individual was in proportion to the security he possessed^
and that if he parted with that source of his credit, rus credit
must consequently suffer. As with individuals, so it was with
Governments, and the credit of a Government, as well as that
of an individual, was in proportion to its means to sustain it
Kow he would say to the gentleman from Kentucky that he
would find it utterly beyond his capacity, to demonstrate any
such proposition as he had assumed A Court of Chancery
would say to the Government, this is a trust fund placed in your
hands for objects specified in the uusts—retain this lund and
apply it as the grantor directed you to do Mr S here re
stated the amendment he intended to offer, and obsei ved that
he was not willing to see this country, lor a period of fifteen
years, encumbered with debt He believed the country pos
sesse 1 ample means to provide for its exigencies, and that with
a proper and judicious economy, our finances would in a short
time, be restored to a flourishing condition We should, said
he, act like men—pursue a systematic and energetic course
and put the means of the Country in a condition to provide foi
the public debt lie never would consent, in time of peace,
to contract a permanent debt He could not consent to vote
for this bill m it<* present fo m To say that a countiy, with
seventeen millions of pcop e, intelligent and enterprising, with
an extensive and fertile teintory, andabundantiesources were
no W[¡lint to raise the sum necessary to provide for theexi&t
ío^EÍobt ofthecountry and to maintain itsciedit, and to pay
the interest which would not amount to moie than thirty cents
a bead, hecouldnever allow
The CHAIR said that the question would first be on Mr
Wise's amendment to extend the term to fifteen years
Mr. WlaE here observed that his amendment seemed to
meet the approbation of nobody Yet, all the arguments asai net
it weiesuscepubleof a satisfactory reply He then took up
m succession four arguments which had been advanced in op
position, replying to them t,erzatinu
The fiistwas that urged by the gentleman fiom Tennessee
(Mr Carothers] and the gentleman from Oaio fMr Pjendle
•row,] írom the fact that the Executive had asked only for twelve
years Gentlemen would pardon him, but this seemed tobe
quite a change of tone. His answer to this was, that though
the Government asked for twelve years as a minimum, this
was no argument against a maximum gre iter in length
The second was that urged by the gentleman írom New
York, lf.Mr Roosevelt,] viz the proviso in the second
section, that Government might sell the stock, if necessary, un
der pal This was the strongest of all aigumentsfor extending
the time Mr W mveigheu against such a piovision as this
going to discredit the Government securities on the very face
of the law which created them. If the time wut. extended thi3
disgrace m ght be obviated
Ine third objection was that bioug t forward ry ano her
gentleman fiom New Yoik, [Mr McKeon j that the Go
veinment had impaired its means by alienating the public
lands This was no reason why it should impan them still
fuilher, by Insisting on a shoit term, and rendering it harder to
get the money
The fourth was the strangest of all, viz that insisted on by
his colleague, [ Mr foiaiTH 1 His idea was to reduce the term to
three years and give high interest for the money It was
doubtful if money could be had at all at three years certain¡y
not much undei 10 pei cent This would raise the puce of mo
ney on the Government and the people destroy ¡state stocks, and
subject everybody to the meicy of the broker1- The very ea
atcs>t form of loa i for both Government and people was a loan
on long time and at low interest
It had been sud Lhat this w e> i pioposmon to t x end the
term five times the length oí t le last loan blil It was not quite
double the turn origin dly pup std in thai bill md mot-t un
wisely and unfoi innately ( uiti led Mr W concluded by ex
pre sing his dtU*nnin ition to c«. alt m his powei to relieve the
Government and on as easy and respectable teims as n could
be accomplished
Mi \1)A.M6 said the gentleman fiom Virginia [Mi Wise]
hnd complained that hi1* pi if ositioti had met with favoi in no
part ot this House Í hat geittlemai" and himse'f were so much
m the habit of ds;reeino with one another, he was not disponed
to differ with him now He assured the gtnileman that he
should not stand ' sohtaiy and alone" on that pioposmon He
should vote for the gentmau's amen lrrnnt He should not enter
into the subject of the gereral state ot the Tieasury at this
tim It was wJl understood by the members ot thu ommn
tec, and he believed that they felt veryrnucb, so far as i elates
to the interest of the country alike on it He did not think, m
eayug that he shsuld vote f \ this proposition t> extend the
arm of tais loan from twelve to fifeeu years, that it was of
much ímpoitance It was possible that the loin might be
n gotmted at a teun of twelve years as advantageously as
it mistht he lor a turn of fifteen years, but as the win ten ex
preboion in the last lettt i ot the Secretary of the Treasury
to the chan man of the Ci m nitteeof Ways and Means was that
they wnhed to have at leist twelve yeats, he was disposed to
ict libeially towaids the Government, and give them three
additional yeaio And he was disposed to do it lamenting
a3 he ilwajs did when he dirfeied fiom his friend [Mr
JLvehett] at his side who sii 1 if this wat, given, no piovi
si m would he made for the payment of the loan He hoped
he ter thing-- an 1 could not agree with his fiiend bicau-e if
tlipy refuse 1 the Government im Joan it was not theExecu
uve Depai ment in it would be the sufferei What was it to
the President of the United States ot his Cabinet—what was
it o this Hou e if they refused the meai = of piymgthe
hone«t debts of the to mtiyi Who would be the sufferers'?
It mu t be the pei==ona to whom the ft th of the Goveinment
was pledged for the r ¿mnent (fits h me^t deb s The pool,
the sol her of our aunv who fights oui battle the sailor of
our navy which is now, as it - emed a favorite | art of the de
fences of the countiy—and he was gla 1 it wa on itiey would
be the laboréis on our public work* If thev rt fused this loan
eveiy man who had a ciernan ¡on the Treasury of the United
States—rich or pooi—when b° wanted the money to pay his
own debts would have to pay ten or fiftee i, oi twenty per tent
on the depreciation of the deht of th? enmity Fie wa^notfor
naking the esperimentum in cor pote ottt He would not re
fuse the means of paying the debts of the Government rnre«tly
made, and for which the creditors are entitled to then demands,
in .oider to press this House and the other House of Co^giess
to theabsolute necessity of making the provision which, he con-
curred with his friend here, was absolutely necessary For this
matter of a loan, the matter of a fiscality, and he would add,
every oilier matter, was of infinitely small importance in com-
paribon with that provision which they were to make for the pay •
ment of the debts oí the country, an! that must be (he must use
the word) by taxation When that bill came, hehoperj he
should have the benefit ofth  vote of the gentleman from Vwgi
urn, as he freely gave the gentleman his vote now
He would vote for the gentleman to extend the loan, and make
theburdenofitaslghtaspossible andthetermsof itasadvanta
eeousas they might be made, but it was a burden afer all He
did not inquire who was responsivo, but so it was—the Go-
vernment wa* unable to pay the debts of the countiy It was
their duty to provide for the payment of the public debt and rai=e
the means of sustaining the credit of the Government These
means weie nowreqmred He would give them, and as he
had said, he would give liberally" He would give them more
lime, because they might get tue loan on more favorable term*,
and the b trden on the people of the countiy wouldbe leseas
thev extended the time of the loan
Mr COOPER of Georgia, said if he tho ght they Could
voto down the proportion of the gentleman from Vugmia, he
should have nothing to say They were now debatma ihetim
toexteid the public debt He though that the vote the,, were
now about to give on the oroposmon ofihegenilemari from Vir
gmia—on which iu seemed the gentleman and his late friend
fiom Massaohu etts had foimeda perfect understanding after
being for some time apart—would give an expie&^on oi the
opinion of this Jlou^eon mo points fiist on the policy of mak
mga per nanentdebt and, «econd, of e&tabli&hing a debt with
out reference to the mexns of its payment
In regard the letter, bethought the gentleman fiom Vet nont
[Mr Everett] was right, and was but reiten ingapnnciple
once laid down by the venerable gentleman from Missachusetts,
that Government ought m no caseto create id"bt without pi o
viding the means to pay it Itw-mheonly principle of afely
and prudently administering the affairs of Government They
were striving, by a direct proposition now which came from
the gentleman fromVngmia, to pledge the faith of this Govern
ment on nothing The Secretary of the Treasury bad looked as
the gentleman from Veimontdid to the repeal of the land bill
the revisions of the tariff, and last, to that scheme, which he
pret.um.ed the gentleman from Virginia would advocate, the
Exchequer, in which, whether he would have the aid of
thegemleman from Massachusetts, would helo be determined
Mr EVERLTTsaid hehul undeistood the gentleman to in
tímate that he (Mr F ) was looking tothe repealofthe land
bill.
Mr COOPER said it was the Secretary of the Treasury to
whom he hU íeferred
As to the pdicy of expending the day of payment for the
purpose of getting a moie certain contract, oi a more advan

credit, and when the means to be provi led wo ild come to hand
Until they should act on some measure by which they could
ralbe the ways and means they furni h to capitalists no indica
tion what they intended to be their policy The gentleman
from Virginia says this bill proposes the mode He knew the
Secretary of the Tieasuiy pointed to taxation, but whether
this House would isree on it would be a question They would
find their stocks lying ovei fir negotiation until they passed the
tariff b) I < i iep  dert the Jan i bill
Mr HOWARD inquired in what part of the report of the
Secretiry of the I reasury he recommended the rei eal of the
landbiin
Mi COOPFR said h  hi 1 not sail the Secretary recom
mended its repeal He had reference to dicu ientl27, the letter
of the^erreta-yof Maich 7 1813 from which he r ad to '•how
the SttroUry1 vow? n this subject He (Mi C)sad there
wis there a \ery daik allusion to (he | ropnety of tlie^e eal of
the distnbi on act [A laugh j The Secretary did not advice
a particulai ( haiictei of tatiff but looked to both sources of

fiom Virginia, [Mi Smith j the shmtest time the best for the
íea^-on that, when thev came toact on the proposition foi raising
the ways end means they ^oul i provide for the payment of
the loan foiihwuh within twelve men hs, or three yeais at
most
Mi SMITH of \ irgima was going turther to argue tne ques
ti n, insisting lhat n the piesent embanas<*ment& of the coun
try a short ciedc an 1 a high ate of inteiest were better than a
long credit and a low late of interest, when he was called to
oider by
Mi MORGMS wno made the point of order that the gentle
man could not speak again under the rule of the House, wl icli
he read providing that no member shall speak more than once
to the samp question wi hout leave of the House, unlebS he be
the mover &c of a proposit on
Ml  SMITH then yielded the floor
And the question being on the amendment of Mr Wise, was
tikenhy telleis, and the amendment was lejectedby ayes34
noes not counted
Mr SMI III of Virginia moved to -takeout m the second
s etion the wird ' twelve "and insert "tl iee " [so as to fix the
time at thieeyeav^in which the loan is tobe reimbursable ]
Mr TÍLÍ MORE said the original bil fixed the time at thiee
years, and of cour e it was entirely unnecessary agam to pio
pi^e this time in this bill
Mr SMITH then withdrew the amendment, f>nd moved to
all it the end of the section the following And at Mich idte
of interest, not exceeding eiglt per cent as may be agreed on
by the Secietaiy of tne Ir asury an 1 the person or persons
taking such !oan,t r ai y part thereof"
Winch amendment was rejected wiihont i division
Mr COOPER, of Georgia, renewed the motion to «ttikeout
1 twelve, ' and m-eit ' three
And the que uoi being taken, tl eamsndmen' was rejected
withouta division
Mr BUINARD «¡unested m order to remove ambiguity in
the bill thepionneiy of inserting the amendment, [adopted on
motion oi Mr File-more un ler the duec ion of the Committee
of Ways aid Meins,] wrich was a*ded at the end of the spc
tion, m the following w )rd« "As shall be agiee I upon and d*>

"reimbursable "
And it was, by general consent, accordingly transposed
Mr RANDALL of Maryland mquned whether n was in
tended that this 1 jan should be .n its terms without limit in the
event of the fiist alternative in-this clause being presented to
the Secretary of the Treasury?
Mr. FILLMORE said the stock was issued redeemable on
its face after six months The moment it was issued, if he
Tieasuiy was prepared to redeem it, it was redeemable after
six months
Mi RANDALL moved to amend the seuion t* str king out
thewords eitherat the will of thefcecietarj cf the lie* ury
after si¿ months' notice, oi "
He stated as his fii st reaso i foi this amendment, that unless
it was adopted this loan would be withou 'imitas o time It
seemed to him to bt, an objection, which ous;l t to have con
sideiable weight here to any ioan, that it should be contracted
without the time being fixed for its íedemption His next ob-
lection was that, if thty allowed the Secretary of the Treasury
to redeem this loan within six month* it wouldmatenally irn
pan the valueof the loan, for the value of a Joan depended ort
lis peimaneicy In order to secure the certain redemption of
the loan within twelve year", and prevent any redemption

without a division

And be it further enacted, That the pi o vi«o to the second
