Cavalry and infantry have been passing, bearing south of west. Wagons and ambulances accompanied the movement. Movement commenced at 3 o'clock,but the dust prevented seeing everything that passed. Cavalry and infantry were passing three-quarters of an hour, but owing to the dust cannot tell in what proportion. Enemy quite active, and stragglers still passing.
