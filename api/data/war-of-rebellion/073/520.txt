The officers of my staff have invariably discharged their arduous and dangerous duties efficiently and gallantry. I have to mourn the loss of two of their number killed on the field - Captain A. H. Engle, aide-de-camp, at the battle of Resaca, on the 14th of May, and Lieutenant Julius E. Karnasch, topographical engineer, while reconnoitering the enemy's lines west of Atlanta on the 4th of August, both gallant and zealous young officers of great promise.

The conduct of my troops during the arduous campaign just closed has merited and qualities commendation, and illustrates the peculiar character and qualities of the American soldier. Habitually occupying an exposed position on the flank of the main army, and operating in a rough, densely wooded, and unknown country, they have fought more than 100 days, and fortified their camps as many nights, frequently surprising and driving in the enemy's flank, but never surprised themselves nor compelled to yield their ground to the enemy. Eternal vigilance and unremitting, toil, united with firmness and gallantry, have been the price of uniform success.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.
