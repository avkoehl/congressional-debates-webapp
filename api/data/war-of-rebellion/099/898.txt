The bridge was good and so were the roads for a few miles this side, but the last three or four miles were very bad indeed, and difficult to pass them after night set in. The rear of the last division train came into camp 4 o'clock this morning. If the roads are not too bad to-day we will move up fifteen or twenty miles.

They were very serviceable to us yesterday and last night. The First Division train is now (6. 15) all out on the road, and Fourth, Second, Third, and supply trains will follow in the order mentioned.
