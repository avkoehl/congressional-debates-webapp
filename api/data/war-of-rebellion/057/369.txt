Numbers 66. Report of Brigadier General William H. Jackson, C. S. Army, commanding Cavalry Division, of operations against expedition to Meridian.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Benton, Miss., March 21, 1864.

MAJOR: In compliance with orders from the major-general commanding, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my command, consisting of three brigades, commanded, respectively, by Brigadier Gens. Wirt Adams, L. S. Ross, and Colonel P. B. Starke, during the late advance of Sherman's army from Big Black to Meridian and its return to Vicksburg:

The enemy commenced crossing Big Black the afternoon of February 3. Were met by Colonel Wood's regiment, Adams' brigade, near Champion's Hill, the morning of the 4th. At the same time Starke's brigade was resisting one corps of the enemy on the Messinger's Ferry road. The entire force of the enemy was about 30,000 infantry and 1,200 cavalry. Heavy skirmishing was kept up until the enemy reached Jackson on the 5th. Ross' Texas brigade had been left on the Yazoo River to defend that country.

The behavior of officers and men of Adams' and Starke's brigades in resisting the advance was excellent.

On arriving at Jackson, my command moved out 10 miles on the Canton road and remained there until the enemy commenced crossing Pearl River, moving in the direction of Brandon.

On February 7, I moved with Starke's brigade, to the rear of enemy near Brandon. Adams' brigade accompanied Major-General Lee on the flank of enemy. There was but little opportunity to accomplish much in rear, except to skirmish heavily with rear guard, pick up stragglers, &amp;c. The enemy moved in good order, well closed up, with wagon train on each brigade in rear of their respective brigades.
