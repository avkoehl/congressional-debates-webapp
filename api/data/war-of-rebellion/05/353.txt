The Secretary may receive an additional report from the commanding officer, and as such may of course submit it for transmission to Congress, but this should be in cases where further information was to be communicated.

JEFFERSON DAVIS,

MARCH 15, 1862

General Evans' report of the battle of Leesburg, together with the reports of the officers who were under him (Colonel Jenifer included) were forwarded by him through General Beauregard, and were received at this office December 3, 1861.

Copies of the whole of these papers were furnished Congress December 10, 1861.

JNO. WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD MILITARY DISTRICT, S. C.,Adams' Run, S. C., March 25, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 18th instant in reply to my letter of the 7th of March, and beg leave to state that it was not my intention to alter the records of the War Department, but to make a supplementary report (which is not unusual) to my report of the battle of Leesburg. As to the separation of the parties, whom I suppose to be General Beauregard and myself, as we are the only persons concerned in the indorsements and forwarding of the reports, my letter can be readily forwarded for the indorsement of General Beauregard. I would therefore respectfully request that my letter be considered as a supplementary report and forwarded for the indorsement of General Beauregard.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,.

N. G. EVANS,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR, Richmond, Va.,

Numbers 22. Return of casualties in the Seventh Brigade, First Corps, Army of the Potomac, at the battle of Leesburg, Va., October 21, 22, 1861.
