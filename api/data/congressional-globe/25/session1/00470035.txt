Mr PATTON pupo^ed a substitute for the
ninth m^e cf the House \ 17 lli^t in all cases the

Mr ROBFPTSON moved an amendment that
the Speakei he leauired to ^ ote last
Mr P VTTON pr-feired thar his name should be
called in the or lei of names, but he was mdiflerent
abo it it    In some of the Stife Legislatures he
was called fi'-st, m otheis—as 11 Virg.ma—last, out
he prefeired the plan he fust intimated best    Mr
P considered fre rule, as it at present stood, as
unconstitutiOi a' and violative or the rights of the
Speaker as a Repiesentative, and of his constitu-
ents also, both of whom were, m his opinion, im-
properly d"pi.ved of his vote by the old ruk"
Mr. THOMAS replied that,  by the standing
I rules already m fotce, the Speaker could vote in
I two cases First, v.hen his \o<e bemggiv^n would
make the divisun of ut He use equal, when the
question would be lost. Second, when it «as equal,
he had the castirg vote Tiie Speaker therelore,
would not íeceive any r ew right under the propos-
ed alteration of the rule than he now had. Mr T.
was not disposed to make any cLaní/1, fer, in time 
of high party excitement, the annu nation of 1 is
vote, especially if fiist given, miglu ha\t a too
powerful irflnence
Mr ADAMS remarked, that if the/ gaie the
Speaker the right to vote, they could not de,une
him of the right to speak, of gr ing reasons l®r
his vote, as m Coinmi tee of thp Whole, where the
Speaker could both vote and «peak Hence Mr
A was opposed to the adoption of this new rule
Mr PATTON was not aw?re that there vas any
rule of the House prohibiting the Speaker from
participating m the discussions of the House, cer-
tainly not in terms He would, however, offer an
amendment expressly g v mg him that right, m the
follow mg w ordo. " And that the Speaker, when-
evei he desires to debate am question under con-
sideration, shall be at lvbeivs to call any member to
the Chair "
commencing at Mame and Wisconsin alternately:

The S nale tVn took up the bdl authorizing the
{3-ereion of the T-easury to issue Tiea<=uiy notes,
Mi    C iLTIOUN said, that wnh  'egard to one
point in the biU—the payment oí interest on the
Tteastiry notes—which the Senator from Massa-
c r/setts so much approved, was to h s (Mr C's)
mind just as  objecuonable    Noi was he satisfied
with the bill, fci ne ler-lly could not make up his

fact, in neither alten a*  'c cou'd he well agicw with
thep'ovis onsof the bill   Be na in 'his dilemma, he
should feel himself compelled to move an amend-
ment to it, for tie sooner adeeisonwas had on

it was the des gr of the Senate to make a sepa-
ration   or  not,   w ould   depend   upon   the course
adopted here     If a separation vv as to be made, now
was the acceptable time     And, if the opportunity
was not now embraced, pcihaps it never would be.
TJrcler th'$ mip^sion, it was his wish, {for this
was a subject which íecumed some little i efiection,)

In regard to the proposition under consideration,
