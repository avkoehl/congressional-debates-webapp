CONTINUANCE OF SELECT COMMITTEES.
Mr. HOUSTON. I offer the following resolu-
tion:
Resolved, That the Select Committee appointed to in-
quire into abuses, bribery, or fraud in the prosecution of
claims before Congress, Commissions, or the Departments,
or in passing through Congress bills embracing private, in-
dividual, or corporate interests, or in obtaining or granting
contracts, be continued after the close of the present session
of Congress, during the continuance of the Executive ses-
sion, commencing on the 4th of March instant.
Mr. WELLER. I desire to amend that. The
committee appointed to investigate the charges
made against the United States Boundary Com-
mission has been engaged in taking testimony for
many weeks past. At least four or five deposi-
tions have been taken to-day. I move, therefore,
to insert in the resolution the words " and the Se-
lect Committee on the Mexican Boundary Com-
mission." The committee will not be able to com-
plete its duties until the extra session of the Senate
is through.
The amendment was agreed to, and the resolu-
tion as amended was adopted.
PERCENTAGE ON COMPENSATION.
Mr. BRADBURY. I desire to offer a resolu-
tion to do a simple act of justice. By an act of
Congress of the last session, our clerks, messen-
gers, laborers, and employees received twenty per
cent, in addition to their pay. The construction
of that law by the Comptroller excluded our Ser-
geant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper, and theSergeant-
at-Arms and Doorkeeper of the House, who are
neither clerks nor messengers. Upon discovering
that, the House made provision for their Sergeant-
at-Arms and Doorkeeper; and the resolution which
I propose is simply to correct the mistake in re-
gard to our Sergeant-at-Arms and Doorkeeper, in
order that they who did not happen to be either
clerks or messengers shall stand as the others did.
The resolution is as follows:
Resolved, That there be paid to the Sergeant-at-Arms of
the Senate and Assistant Doorkeeper Holland,who received
no part of the percentage of increase allowed to other
officers and employees of the Senate at the last session, the
same addition to their regular pay which the House of Rep
resentatives has authorized to be added to the former pay ot
the Sergeant at-Arms and Doorkeeper of the House.
The resolution was read a first and second time,
and considered by the Senate as in Committee of
the Whole; and no amendment being proposed, it
was reported to the Senate, ordered to a third read-
ing, read a third time, and passed.
Mr. WELLER subsequently said: A resolu-
tion was introduced by the Senator from Maine a
few moments ago in regard to percentage of two
of our officers. The question upon that resolu-
tion was taken without a division. I therefore
move to reconsider the vote.
Mr. BRADBURY. I should like to know the
reasons for that motion. There seems to be some
misapprehension on the part of the Senator.
Mr. WELLER. I desire to know the reason
why a discrimination should be made in favor of
tnma
Mr. BRADBURY. I will explain it. At the
last session of Congress there was put into the
appropriation bill a provision that the clerics and
messengers should receive twenty per cent, in ad-
dition to their pay. The Comptroller decided that
the Sergeants-at-Arms and Assistant Doorkeepers
of both Houses were neither clerks nor messen-
gers, consequently they did not get the twenty per
cent. Since that was known to the House, it was
corrected by making an addition to the pay of their
