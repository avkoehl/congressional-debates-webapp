To General McCLELLAN:

Clouds of dust running parallel with mountains a little north of west are seen. It goes north.

To JEROME:

The general says can you give more definite information. How far off was the dust-this side of Martinsburg or the other?

P.

(Received.)

To General McCLELLAN:

The dust appears to be on a line between Williamsport and Martinsburg, about 11 miles from Sharpsburg, between the mountains and the river, going southwest, now extending a long distance.

To Captain FISHER:

Franklin and Couch are leaving. Any orders?

CLARKE.

To MBN:

You will daily send to these headquarters three reports and one during the night-at 7 a. m., 1 p. m., and 12 p. m. If the state of the weather precludes the possibility of these reports being made precisely at these hours, they will be made as soon as possible thereafter. Give signatures to reports.

B. F. FISHER,

Captain, Commanding Signal Detachment.

25th.

To General McCLELLAN:

A very considerable movement and much dust S. 15 W. from this mountain, apparently 5 miles distant southwest from Shepherdstown. Smoke of encampment and dust are seen in the vicinity of Martinsburg. The dust seen near Shepherdstown is close to a sharp cut in the woods, like one made for a railroad. I can see no enemy east of Shepherdstown or south of Martinsburg.

Major MYER.

(Received-12 and 6 report.)

All quiet. Fog precluded the possibility of any report sooner emanating from here.

JEROME.

(Sent.)

To MBN STATION:

Another exhibition of such gross negligence will compel me to prefer charges of incompetency. The guard must not be permitted to leave the glass until relieved.

FISHER.

(Sent.)

To MBN:

Send a full and concise report immediately.

FISHER.

(Received.)

To Captain FISHER:

No report. The smoke hides everything, and has all day.

(Received 7 a. m.)

27th.

All quiet. Clarke not visible.

JEROME.
