received in New York foi the pubac cUes, they
were driven "back depreciated on th b anches, to
the ffflmftent risk of stopping specie payments n
one of them, (in Georgia ) and leading s >on to a

But, above all, and ove all ot'-er considerations,
this large capit il in the Dill seems o be urgtd un-
der the delusive idea hat this Bank, Hitb such a
capital, is to brmg re let to evtry body m every

will wash sands, ei g a ¡ over the whole country, it
is to b —nt t a Danae'o shower, to corrupt and be-
tray, but a tort ol fertilizing dew, to moisten and
start inte Ufe e/ery drooping interest in society,
and to op'rate as a political indefinable elixir for
all ihe disorders in society. It seems lo be ima-
gined ¡hat the Bank will cieate new capí al to the
extent of thirty millions, when most of it, not mere
credit, is prooably to be only ihe transfer oi other
c ,p tal now employed in c hei banks or other pur-
uia, and its wt odrawat ihenee is probably to in-
commode and embarrass ther , much more than it
wnl beneft here. If <*ny n¿w capital ,s introduced
from abroad, in the shape of coin, it will at once
reiurn ii the country con'mue3 mdeb ed abroad;
and if it stimulates to larger imports and overtrad-
ing, will not only return, but carry more with it,
and cause lasting evils The imptrts of specie
by the last Bank in its early years cobt over half a
million, and probably benefited it or the country
scarce a dollar, because, by expansion, it kept ihe
balance of trade largely against u<\ The addition
of tms Bpnk capita!, it co.iposed chiefly oi credit
by tock notes, as most of the private portion of it
will doubtless be, under the present provision al-

The power and durabl  wealth ot society are chief-

A Bank is, to be ure, m one sense, a labor-
