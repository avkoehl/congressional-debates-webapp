CHATTANOOGA, July 21, 1863.

[General BAUREGARD:]

MY DEAR GENERAL; Accept my thanks for the copy of your letter to our friend Johnston, * and your indorsement of the 7th instant.+ Our view in regard to what ought to have been done in this country are identical. Failing to impress the idea on others who control, I was put strictly on the defensive, and have struggled with insufficient force until at length depleted so far that safety compelled me to fall back.

Rosecrans refused to give me battle, except on his own views of pushing the campaign in Tennessee, and feeling the weakness of our dispersion. I fell back to this line, and reported for orders on 1st July. Twice since have I reported no enemy following, and asked for orders for this army. No response, and yet Johnston, within five days of me, is falling back day by day, yielding ground we cannot recover, and without which we cannot service. By this time whole army could have been in Mississippi and victory won. As it is, we may except to be destroyed in detail. What a sad result to affairs at Vicksburg and Port Hudson! An army closed in, besigned, and starved in the midst of abundance. Several time I tried to impress, and starved in the midst of ambulance. Several times I tried to impress the ides of your arrangements of last year, but to no effect. Fortified places I felt were to be halt by small garrisons, and armies held for the field, but the rule is reversed. An army is backed up against a river by a force in cannot fight and in a place which it cannot scape.

These things are too sad to dwell on. May God protect and defend you in your trials.

Very truly, yours,

BRAXTON BRAGG.
