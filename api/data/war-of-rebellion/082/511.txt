(Received 5.40 a. m.)

General MEADE:

GENERAL: My second division in the order of march has not yet crossed the bridge. It is crossing. There was a delay of an hour or less in the march, which is against the commander, not yet accounted for to me. As soon as it is daylight I will see the condition of things, and push the troops ahead as soon as the cavalry is over, or a part of it.

General GEORGE G. MEADE:

I have taken four pieces of artillery and some prisoners, who say they belong to Longstreet's corps, and that there are three brigades here in my front on this side of first creek left. I am making preparations to continue my attack on them; my troops are now advancing.

My last brigade of infantry is crossing the river and the cavalry will follow immediately. Since all chances of surprise have failed it is a question now whether the cavalry shall endeavor to break through at once or wait until I advance farther up the creek. The guns captured, which I have drawn in, are four 20-pounder Parrotts.

General MEADE,
