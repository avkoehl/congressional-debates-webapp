THE CONGRESSIONAL G&OBE.
January 31,
complicated, and troublesome negotiation be-
tween hostile interests, who- finally came to a
compromise on the subject.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The Senator will recol-
lect that we varied from that, and the House
varied from it. While we adopted one part of
the compromise we did not adopt the other.
Mr. SHERMAN. The representation upon
which my friend from Massachusetts acts comes
to us from a gentleman who professes to be in-
terested in it. I agree that he is an intelligent
man: but he was heard patiently; he had the
benefit of a full hearing. He refused to enter
this conference, refused to take part in it, be-
cause he made a character of broadcloth that
he said must have wool from South America,
and it was useless for him to take part in it.
But at the same time all the leading interests
of Massachusetts and all the manufacturing
States were ably represented. It was a meet-
ing called by the manufacturers themselves.
Any departure from the settlement then made
creates complication and trouble.
In regard to the changes made by the com-
mittee I will simply say that we took the bill
in this respect as it finally passed the House,
taking their descriptions and classifications. It
is true the Committee on Finance reduced t.fie
duty five cents on woolen goods, but that is
fully compensated by other reductions made
in this bill. The duty on nearly all the drugs,
chemicals, and dye-stuffs used in the manufac-
ture of woolen goods is thrown off. The manu-
facturers themselves compute the duty on the
drugs under the old tariff at two .and a half
cents a pound on woolen goods. Then if fifty
cents, as agreed upon by the House, was the
proper rate, this would reduce it to forty-seven
and a half cents. In addition to that, the Sen-
ate have reduced the duty on (locks, which Mr.
Slater, the gentleman referred to, tells mo is a
very important and necessary constituent ele-
ment in the manufacture of broadcloth, from
twelve cents to three cents. Mr. Slater him-
self tells me that a considerable quantity of
this article, called flocks, clippings of wool, is
introduced into the manufacture of broad-
cloth. I have no doubt that the reduction
made in the Senate on drugs and chemicals
and on Hocks will very nearly compensate the
five cents a pound taken off the specific duty ;
at least very near it. The result is that wo al-
lowed forty-five cents a pound to compensate
the duty on wool, instead of fifty cents, and
relieved them from the duty on drugs and gave
them some advantage in the flocks.
The only reason I have for voting against this
amendment is that I think this subject has been
so fully considered by the persons interested,
and they have finally agreed upon it in such a
shape that any disturbance of the arrangement
would only involve ns in complications which
we cannot settle, not being experts. I would
not vote for the proposition of the Senator from
Illinois; I would not vote to increase the duty
on wool, because all the people I represent,
both manufacturers and wool-growers, seem
to be entirely satisfied with this arrangement.
We manufacture some woolen goods in Ohio,
and I heard no complaint of the duties in this
bill. I hope they will not bo disturbed. To
raise this duty to fifty cents a pound, as pro-
posed by the Senator from Massachusetts, on
the coarser goods, would be to ignore the fact
that we have thrown off' for the benefit of the
woolen manufacturers a very large amount of
revenue now levied upon drugs, chemicals, and
dye-stuffs. That reduction is equal to two and
a half cents a pound according to their own esti-
mate and if the estimate of the commissioner
is reliable, that we consumed one hundred and
seventeen million pounds in this country at two
and a half cents a pound, it would amount to a
very large sum thrown off for their benefit. I
think they ought to be satisfied with that.
Mr. WILSON. I propose to modify my
amendment slightly, at the suggestion of some
Senators to put in this form:
Valued at one dollar and less per pound, forty-five
ecntij per pound, and, in addition thereto, thirty-fiva
per cent, ad valorem.
That leaves that just as it is in the bill now;;
and then to add:
Valued at over one dollar and less than $1 50 per
pound, fifty eentsper pound, and, in addition thereto,
forty per cent, ad valorem ; valued at over §1 50 per
pound, fifty cents per pound, and, in addition thereto,
forty-five per cent, ad valorem.
I think the Senate ought ta consent to this;
and now I wish simply to say a word to the
Senator from Ohio. The gentleman to whom
reference has been made is not the only gen-
tleman of large experience who- does not be-
lieve tMs bill to be just. Some of\he very
ablest men in Massachusetts and in New Eng-
land earnestly believe that this bill, so far as it
concerns two thirds of the woolen manufac-
tures of the country, is not so good as the pres-
ent tariff. The carpet manufacturers and the
worsted manufacturers are abundantly satisfied,
and I do not propose to touch them.
Mr. GRIMES. This is rather a refreshing
proposition, and I have no doubt it will be
adopted, as this is a western measure we are
told by the Senator from Massachusetts, pro-
motive entirely of western interests secured
by western influence ; but I presume this prop-
osition, at least, will be adopted by eastern
votes. I do not rise to oppose it particularly,
but simply to reply to that part of the Senator's
remarks in which he said that the duties upon
these woolen goods would only amount to some
ten or fifteen per cent. I happen to hold in
my hand a table made out by a gentleman who
I understand is perfectly familiar and has been
for many years with the receipts of foreign
goods at the New York custom-house, and he
vouches for its accuracy. The special com-
missioner of revenue has proved the accuracy
of some of the results by computations made.
This table shows the amount under the bill as
it now stands. It will be observed by the Sen-
ate that the proposition of the Senator from
Massachusetts does not decrease any of these
classifications, but it leaves the poor cloth to pay
precisely the duty fixed by the bill, and declares
that the moie valuable cloths shall paya higher
rate. It appears by this table that the lowest
duty imposed by the bill at present is fifty per
cent., and it ranges from that up to one hundred
and twenty per cent. In order that it may be
known precisely what we are doing, as every
Senator has had one of these tables submitted
to him, I will send one to the reporter to be
printed, so that those who choose to see what
we do and to pass on our actions here, may have
the opportunity of reading the table.

Mr. FESSENDEN. I do not know what
these duties are; I have not computed them,
and should not be able to compute them ; but
these tables are entirely deceptive. While
there may be a certain percentage of duty, it is
not that percentage of protection. What the
Senator from Massachusetts said was that this
duty wa3 only so much protection. I stated
that the fifty-three cents which the manufac-
turers demanded as duty upon woolens was
merely repayment of what they had to pay out
in duties and other expenses upon the ma-
terials. That, therefore, is thrown out of the
computation of the protection. Then of the
thirty-five per cent, ad valorem ten per cent,
is to be taken off for what they pay in internal
revenue and on account of the difference in
the valuation abroad. That leaves the protec-
tion twenty-five per cent. In addition to this
the Senate committee reduced the specific
duty to forty-five cents a pound. I think that
the explanations made by the Senator from
Ohio show that that is not so great a reduc-
tion as the Senator from Massachusetts seemed
to suppose. Still I fancy the manufacturers at
this rate would get less than twenty-five per
cent, protection : how much less I am unable
to say, for I have made no calculation.
Mr. GRIMES. I ought to have stated that
the Senate has changed the duty on bunting,
which is included in the table I sent to the
reporter. It has been reduced to some extent;
I do not know to what extent, though not a
great deal I understand. It was reduced some
on the motion of the Senator from Ohio, [Mr.
Sherman. ]
Mr. SPIIAGUE, I do not propose to take
up the time of the Senate, but I have exam-
ined the proposition suggested by the Senator
from Massachusetts, and I must say that the
views he has expressed to the Senate are cor-
rect in every particular. Of course the duty
on the high-priced article does not interfere
with or bear heavily on the poorer classes of
our people; but it is absolutely necessary that
the higher-priced article should be put in a
different classification from the coarser article.
The gentleman who has represented this
case to me is the son of the original pioneer
of cotton manufacturing in the United States,
who established it here before anybody else,
and he brings to bear upon this subject more
practical knowledge, more experience, more
devotion to his business perhaps than any man
in that business in the United States. There
is no doubt but that the business of the pro-
duction of the finer broadcloths in the United
States would go out of existence under the
operation of the present bill as it stands. The
throwing off the duties upon dye-stuffs which
has been referred to is a matter of no consid-
eration whatever; they enter into the cost but
very slightly; some logwood and some sumac,
and some other things of that kind. Then it
must be rememberedthere are additional taxes
on starch and other articles which enter very
largely into the production of these goods,
which more than compensate for the duties
thrown off on the chemicals. I trust the-
amendment suggested by the Senator from
Massachusetts will prevail.
Mr. MORRILL.' I have listened with a
great deal of patience, I trust, during the nine
days this bill has been under consideration,
with very slight disposition to participate in
any way in the discussion; but I think I un-
derstand the proposition to which an amend-
ment is now moved, and it seems to me so
manifestly unjust to an interest which is, in
some sense, peculiar to my own State that I
can hardly forbear the expression of the con-
viction that it would be very unjust if the Sen-
ate were not to adopt the amendment pro-
posed by the Senator from Massachusetts. I
understand it to be agreed by the members of
the Committee on Finance that the bill as it
stands does not give that fair and equal pro-
tection to this particular interest, the higher,
grades of manufactured cloths, that it does to.
other kindred manufactures. That is a con-
ceded fact. Why not? Nobody suggests, I
