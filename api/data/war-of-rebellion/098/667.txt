through the gap between the One hundred and forty-third New York and Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers. He managed to obtain a cross-fire upon my four right regiments, which were at this time almost destitute of breast-works, and without a connection on their right or left; but not an inch of ground was yielded. My four right regiments held their ground most gallantly, while the Eighty-second Illinois Volunteers, aided by the artillery which commanded the gap and behaved very gallantly, poured so galling a fire into the enemy's flanking column as to compel it to hastily withdrew. My men now collected rails and quickly built themselves a breast-work. This work had to be suspended several times, owing to the repeated attacks of the enemy. It was finally completed so far as to render it a respectable covering from the enemy's fire. But this was not accomplished a moment too soon. The enemy made at least five furious assaults upon the line, but was in each instance handsomely repulsed. He was not permitted to maintain a line of battle five minutes at one time within a hundred yards of my line. At each successive repulse numbers of his men came in and surrendered themselves as prisoners of war.

Thus the tide of battle ebbed and flowed along my front until night-fall, when the firing ceased and my four right regiments were relieved by Colonel Selfridge's brigade, and withdrawn to a line of works about 300 yards to the rear. The One hundred and first Illinois Volunteers, having rejoined the brigade late in the afternoon, had been already formed in this second line of works, but had not been seriously engaged.

Thus terminated an action which cost my brigade 107 officers and men killed, wounded, and captured. Among the number were many of the bravest and best of my entire command, but where all did so well I cannot find it in my heart to make invidious distinctions.

I sincerely regret to record the loss in this affair of Captain William Ballentine, of the Eighty-second Ohio Veteran Volunteers, who was mortally wounded, and has since died. He was a young officer of great promise, and his loss cannot be easily repaired.

The same statements are true of Lieutenant George Lyman, of the thirty-First Wisconsin Volunteers, who was wounded and captured by the enemy while gallantly leading the skirmish line at the beginning of the engagement, and who also afterward died. * I cannot bestow too much praise upon these two young officers, who have fallen at the post of duty and given their lives for their country.

The following additional officers were wounded in the engagement: Captain Robert Patterson, Sixty-First Ohio Veteran Volunteers, slightly, and Lieutenant William H. Thomson, Eighty-second Ohio Veteran Volunteers, severely.

On the 20th and 21st my brigade remained in the same position it occupied on the night of the 19th, except that it advanced about noon of the 21st and held for a short time nearly the same ground occupied by it at the commencement of the battle of the 19th. The enemy had withdrawn to his original position. Several wounded men of my command, who had been left upon the field, were brought in during this temporary advance. My troops did not engage the enemy, and I was soon directed to move them back to their old position, which I did. During the night of the 21st the enemy retreated. My brigade marched at 9. 30 a.m. toward Troublefield's Store en route for Cox's Bridge. The trains preceded the troops early in the morning. At 8 p.m. my
