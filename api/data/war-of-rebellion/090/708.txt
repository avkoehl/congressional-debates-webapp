Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The following received since my dispatch:

Governor CURTIN:

Rebels entered Hagerstown at 9.40.

A. G. CURTIN.

CONFIDENTIAL.] WAR DEPARTMENT,

August 5, 1864.

Governor CURTIN,

Harrisburg:

Your telegrams have been received. A force believed by General Grant to be adequate for the occasion is being directed by him against the enemy.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

MONOCACY, MD., August 6, 1864-10 a. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

From the dispatches received by General Hunter it appears to me evident there is no great force of the enemy, likely not more than 2,000 men, north of the Potomac, and they engaged in gathering and moving off stock and produce. I believe they will be gone before our troops can get near them.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 6, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Monocacy:

One brigade of Torbert's division of cavalry left last night and another will start this morning for Harper's Ferry, via Monocacy. As your telegram of last night says, "Send all cavalry yet to arrive," &amp;c., I presume you allude to the division expected from City Point. Do you want an order issued making a military division of the four departments, or shall it await your return here?

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

MUDDY BRANCH, August 6, 1864.

(Received 8.10 p. m.)

Major C. H. RAYMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: My line undisturbed. Guerrillas getting shy; a few yet on this side. Have furnished guard for telegraph post at Darnestown, and would place post at Rockville to better protect communication on the pike if I had men enough.

JNO. M. WAITE,

Major, &c.
