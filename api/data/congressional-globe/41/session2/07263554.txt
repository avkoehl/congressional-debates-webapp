THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 18,
which he alleges to be due to him for services
as yeoman in the United States Navy; which
was referred to the Committee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. COLE presented a resolution of the
Legislature of California, asking the construc-
tion of a suitable building for the use of the
United States Government on the block of
land situated in the city and county of San
Francisco, known as the custom-house block;
â– which was referred to the Committee on Public
Buildings and Grounds.
He also presented a resolution of the Legis-
lature of California, asking to have the city of
Yallejo lawfully declared a port of entry under
the laws of the United States ; which was
referred to the Committee on Commerce.
Mr. COLE. I also present the petition of
Enoch Lott, who represents that 011 the 3d day
of July, 18G8, while in the employ of the quar-
termaster's department at Kodiac, Alaska ter-
ritory, he met with a serious accident while
some soldiers of the United States Army were
engaged in firing an old Russian cannon some
thirty feet distant from where he was standing,
when the piece exploded, and a portion of
which struck his left leg below the knee, caus-
ing a fracture of the larger bone and dislocat-
ing the other, and not having them properly
set at the time of the accident he was left with
a short, deformed leg ; while in this condition
his name was dropped from the pay-rolls of the
quartermaster's department, to date from July
3, 1868, the date upon which the accident
occurred. He therefore prays that Congress
may grant him compensation from the time he
left San Francisco until he returned to it, in
accordance with the terms of his agreement. I
move the reference of this petition to the Com-
mittee on Claims.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is it a claim for
military services? Such claims have frequently
been referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs.
Mr. COLE. I hardly know to what com-
mittee it should be referred; but I think it had
better go to the Committee on Claims.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be so
referred.
Mr. COLE. I also present a concurrent reso-
lution of the Legislature of the State of Cali-
fornia, representing that the Presidio reserva-
tion in that State, only a small proportion of
which is needed for military uses, should be
devoted, as has been suggested by a bill intro-
duced in Congress, to the use of the city of San
Francisco for a public park. They set forth
some very strong reasons why that use of the
reservation should be made; that it is well
watered and the soil productive, and is capable
of being beautified and made a place of attrac-
tion for the people of that city. They set forth
also that a good deal of the outside lands of
the city are drifting sand and not, therefore,
capable of being converted into an attractive
and beautifnl park.
Aside from this resolution, I can state that
the people of that city are exceedingly anxious
to have such use made of the Presidio reser-
vation, which occupies the point or angle formed
by the Golden Gate and the Pacific ocean,- and
contains some sixteen or seventeen hundred
acres of ground. There certainly can be no
reason why so large a military reservation
should be retained by the Government actually
in the city of San Francisco, and not far from
the center of the city. There has been, to be
sure, an adverse report upon the bill on this
subject; but the case is on the Calendar, and I
move that this resolution lie on the table for
consideration at the time that bill is called up
for action.
The motion was agreed to.
