from that place, and say that Early with three divisions was moving toward strasburg last night. Although this report is not fully reliable, I have ordered all the stores which can be transported to be removed from here to Harper's Ferry. Nearly all our cavalry and our scouts are out to gain more information, which will be telegraphed to Washington as soon as received. With this dispatch I will send an additional in cipher in regard to a dispatch received from General Hunter. Please acknowledge.

MARTINSBURG, W. VA., July 2, 1864.

(Received 10 a. m. 3rd.)

General Hunter informed me to-day that General Sullivan's division is ordered here, but that it could not arrive before fire or six days. I have here two regiments of Ohio guards and one battery. At Leetown there are two old regiments of infantry and five pieces of artillery, and about 1,000 dismounted cavalry (armed). Here our mount cavalry consists of detachments to the number of 1, 8000 men. The cavalry is in front, with the exception of a reserve near Martinsburg. I have taken command of all these troops, and will concentrate them at a proper point in case of emergency, in view of the expected movement of Sullivan. I will defend Martinsburg with all our power in case of an attack, and hold communication with Cumberland if you do not wish me to hold communication with Harper's Ferry. In this case I must evacuate Martinsburg and concentrate our forces at Charlestown. Please answer immediately.
