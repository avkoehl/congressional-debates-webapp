Errors in Mr. Roosevelt's
statement.
Mr. Roosevelt omits from
his statement the esti-
mate of$ll,29410 for con-
tract No. 12, on page 2 of
report, which was a cor-
rect estimate of the ori-
ginal contract and ex-
tension, as explained
below.*
Mr. Roosevelt omits from
his statement the esti-
mate of $70,500 for con
tract No. 20, on page 3 of
report, and consequently
the excess of the actual
cost over the estimated
cost is only $53,205 75, and
and not $123,705 75 as Mr.
Roosevelt states it. The
width of street being in-
creased fifteen feet,which
work was in progress,
upon the petition of
property owners, caused
additional cost.
* Mr. Hudnell's work on Pennsylvania avenue, from Fifteenth street to Rook creek, will be found estimated at $12,047 78, (page 2, contract No. 12.) instead of
*753 68 as stated by Mr. Roosevelt. The extension of Mr. Hudnell'scontract from Eighteenth street to Rock creek, as correctly stated m the list of contracts, was
forresetting oldcrab and relaying old brick pavement. While the work was in the course of execution a large amount of old curb and old brick pavement was
found to be unfit for use, and was replaced by new curb and new brick pavement. On table 32 Mr. Roosevelt will find the amounts of new curb and new brick
pavement, the excess of cost of which over the class_of work contemplated by the extension of this contract is $14,645 98, which will appear from the following
St12,^square yards of new briek pavement, at fifty-five cents per square yard, which is the difference between the price (eighty cents) of laying new p^e™.0^
and the price (twenty-five cents) for relaying old brick pavement    1*549 80
370 Unellfeet of new five-inch curb, at ninety-five cents per foot, which is the difference in price of laying new ($1 20) and the price of relaying ^ ^
