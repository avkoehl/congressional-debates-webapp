assume all the qualities of his Satanic Majesty, was saddenly
found to be a marvellous proper man, "as a constitutional m
terpreter ihat would compare with Mr JefTersi n himself," as
a "patriot statesman,' 4Ía national deliverer and benefactor "
"one who had proved himself equal to such a cnsis, and was
worthy to be trusted now and hei eaiter by a generous and mag
nammoua people " He is told that "the Whig slang about his
being pledged to carry out the principles of that paity is abao
luteiy ridiculous " Again he is told by the crafty editor "Mr
Tyler's principles, duties, policy, interests, are all wuh us, if
he can only see them But will i e see the mí We 1 ope- and
trust he will not throw himself into the arms of the Inderal
Whigs '* Thisis toa Whig President' And then comes ¡he
grand climacteric, the open, bold invitation, the barefaced pro
position, he is bid form the public market with a* much con-
tumely as an old brosen down cart hnrse, in an article publish
ed in the same paper, addre3=ed to ' His Excellency the Prest
dent of the United States," which concludes with this emphatic
Bujjestión
' At this moment you eatmot be ignorant that the Demociats,
as a party, ace exceedingly strong The ptoportion of the
Whig party who adhere to you, and who will not go for Mr
Clay, is also large Common sense on this matter speaks a hn
guage that the lowest mind will not misunderstand Recol-
lect, s r, that you are the son of a sire who, to a Chr stian's vir
tu«s, united a Roman's firmness, that made him a victor over
both public and puvata foes, and gave to him a proud lank
amufg those great men, which secures to the Ancient Dominion
an imperishable fame u
This article professes to have been vmtten from this place,
and la signed "Washmgtoman "
Now I beg that it may not be foigotten that Mr Tj ler is the
individual who has always claimed the credit of being the on
gmatorof the one teim principíelo strongly advocate X in that
election, which brought him into power—not on the farcual
f round now asaunW by some of his friend* , an 1 no doiiht by
imself, too, to wit, tint the ¡onor was too high tobe con fe it ed
on one man twice, bin that the influence and pationage of the
office should not be everted to secure i re elec ion, and yet he
had not been in olhce mm wt>< k , having then ne irly the whole
Presidential term of lout jeaia to uin before an open attempt
was made to create i trntd parly, foi the purpose of securing
to him a second term and he not only lends his c luntesance to
it, but to accomplish it frustrates and deftatt  the mea*=uies oí
the party thit cievtted him, 'urns a tie if ear to the admonitions
and entreaties of his 'ormei friends collects aroun I him as < on

Sir, let mercad to you a sentiment given by Mi Tyler during
the year precehng ihe nommUion of Genual Hanison ar a
Wh'g festival n die county of ¡south imp <m, Vn^inia
"By  John   1 > ler" —Pilgum Piesidents and   tt ivelimg  ( i

One tein, and  no u election   the  best initios ol thecoun
try demand it    Will nut the popular suffrages decree it m
840V
Thisis the sentiment of the man who nowalieady sets him
«If up is a candi late for a second term   What nfluence the
course of the 0| position party and presses may h ive exerted
over him it is difficult to tel!, except from his public acts, but
about the time I have advertid to, when these pioposittons
were made, a rttnirkible c i inge came ovei the ipnit of his
dream, and he sud lenly arrested all removals from office, and
reinstated some thit had been removal as obnoxious to the
rules laid down by himself, or fiom incompetency to discharge
the duties aligned them An extiaordmary case occurred m
this city
The Oommis íoner of th< Land Office, with tin a||i( nation
of the ^euuaiy of the Tieasury, notified eleven < luí s in his
Departmentthattheirsciviceswere no longtr requited It h
said they waited on Mi Tyler and ief íesented to him that
although they vvt re hoodie to G net il Ham on and to Whig
principles yet they weie veiy goodTylei men, and they were
all ordt red in-.f infer, du i mg the absence of the If i ad of the De
paitment fi >m the city, to be i em-Hated live of the places,
nowever, had already been supplied, and it was too late
for them The other six resumed the duties nfi hen office,
and remain tlure to this moment, wuh the exception oí une,
who has 3ince, Í understand, resigned Theie wag an inch
vidual among them who has often been brought to the notic*
of this House, and is now in my eye at Ihe Globo rerouet1*-
duic
Sir, who does not recollect (that was a member of th« last
Congress) how olten the name of Lund Washington was intro
duced on this floor by the honorable member lioin the Louisville
disttictm Kentucky, fMr Güavcs,] when, pointing h s finger
to him as 1 do now, he said
"Filer" '■'its a man, í un 1 Wisbmgton, nowoccupied as a Re
porter foi the Globe who at this moment is as ilinrd offi^ci of
the Government, at $1,200 a yeat, neglecting and quitting his
duty to come here toembirk in the poh ics < i the coun'iy
This, an, is the same individual ofwnom it has i eeu •md that
still holding his clerkship he was sent to Kentn ky during th
late canvass to establish a paitisan prcs<-, and dunng hig ah
awnce hired a substitute at ©200 ayeai toperfoim his duties as a
clerk'"
And this is one of the individual*  removed an 1 afterwards re-
instated by Mi Tyier because he was a iyler nan Sir, such
a bartering of principles and of public i ighia s hiss in the no*?
tnls of alt honorable men
Let me now ask you and the countiy, Mi Speakei, who
ther I have not made good my charge of perhdv agamst Mr
Tyler? An i if any mm still doubts, lPf me thiow all th
proo s I have adduced to the win Is <m i s'iil one substantial
grounl i  left me upon which alone I would oe wilhng to le t
my ehargs
Is Mr Tyler spoken of by any body for the n°xt Pie=ilemnl
term? Yes, hess' liy whom? By the Whigs'* No, not \
man of them1 but by the Loco F< co pauy ' And sir, is it
within the compass ofhuman belief tliat tint puty would take
John Tyler, who was so leeently elected as one of the i bitteiest
opponents, as their candidate, if he Í ad un l&rn >ne no change,
and tl ey had received no assurances oi enc-omagement ft-om
^k —the «.#ry men who s« recently opposed, ridiculed, and
abused him? No, sir the thm¿ is not a edible Theie must
havebeen achdnsesomevshere,enher m Mr ly'ei ortheOp
position party Ihey do not admit that th^y have changed,
and yet ihey ha\e by s mie miricul >us means c< me together
What, then, is the nresistible conrlusion? Why, that Mr
Tyler has changed, and deseited his party and his pnn
ciples
But there is no perfi ly no treachery in this—not at all , be
cause, my gentlemen, he has diff red with us on one point only
—whicn, by the bye, I have shown not to be °ot because re
moval of unfaithful and incompetent men from office was a
most important item m the contemniaied reform oftheWbisi
party But suppose it to be tiue that we differ ml} on this one
point, suppose th s great, paiamount, all absorbing question of
cuirency should be the only question about which we have
been deceived in the action of th* President, could nottreacheiy
be established from that? If Mr 1 yler should attempt to fasren
theteub Treasury upen us eithei openly «r in disgu^e, would
theie be no perfidy in this1* Why pir Arnold and Hull only
differed on one point with their fellow soldie s and brother
oflircts, and that was, whethpr they should fight for or against
their country an 1 here the swale queatmn with Mr Tylei is,
whe'htr hebhall c > opeiate wim the Wh!°s who put him in
powei or so over to the Loco Tocoa, by whom ho hope* to be
retained in power
Pshaw ' tbn'ttalk to me about his filelity T know too much
of this business to be duped by such slant? A diffuence of
opinion conscientiously entertained, I could tolerate with as
much libeiahtv as other men butconsuenti us convictions do
not undergo as ftequent and lapid changes as Mr Tyler has un
dergone m the last ihioe months
No, eir, an ur h >ly, an ung< dlj, ir 1 corrupt coalition, I be
iieve in my heart was about to be fow ed and will yet be
formed, if not defeated by thr p umpt action oi the Whig
party, and " head hnn or die,' is me motto that I havp adopttd,
and th re is no opt-n fur and lonorabie means that I will n t
atloputo frustrate ins designs

the wishes of Virgin a, while it may comport with his ambition
to do so, but we have no guarantee thrt he v?ill not set aside

tempt him "
These weie the opinions generally enteitained of Mr Tyler's
course at that day I now come down to a later period 1 the
wmter of 1838, Mi Tyler was again aca ididate foi (he ^e
nate, m opposition to Mi Ri\fs I suppoited him warmly,
but he could not get tbeenme voteol his own paity, and he
was defeated During that contest, which lasted nevei al w eeks,
he wa= liequentiy wuhdiawn ind renornuinted On one occa-
sion he was nominated by a memhei ol the then Administration
patty, and, on hi¡> reining f- im the hou^e, he was aekfd if he
would accept a non mation in in ihat quarter, to which it w is
said he replied, th it he was before the 1 e_islature, and would
take the appointment fi >m aiy quarter he could get it Now,
s r, let me he understood Ido not say that this charge was
well founded, on the contrary, Idelenied bim atíbenme—1
have delended him ever since though 1 have been almost the
only man in the State that did defend him, lfotheisdid, I have
not heard of it 1 do not now etmgehim with it 1 belie vedtat the
time he was a'to^ether incapable of givir g ut erer ce to puch a
sentiment, though I confers his recent course has greaily shaken
confidence m my formet opinions I mention the circumstarce
only as a matter of his ory, foi the purpose oí showing that the
charge of peifidy has nothing of loveity m it, when cornected
Withhisname
TI e consequences, however, wheincr tiue oi filse, were most
disa tious to bin, it not only ie\ \ed the roc ilection of the
the scene'1 of 18 7, but it utterlj a id t ntircly ] i estrated him m
►■s ate Theie was, at the time of the Han abuig Convention,
no office in ihe gilt t f \jigimt, fit to the bigl est io thp mnn

thought it would be indeilea e to voLe agam&t him, and they did
not vote at all
But I dismiss this partof the subject It is a painful part to
me but necet-sarj to my vmd cation I have been challenged to
t e aigument a? d I mean to sustain my position ai d my charge,
becatse I behpve it to 1 e true I ho e who tin k I have per on
al u i\\£ nfy and ex emtty mi\ d up with my political ndigna
turn do menju&tiee I was ins friend personalh and wdb dig
poce] to be so politically as my who e course towaids him
w >uld show, up to ihe iron ent that! e \eucd the fiist Bank
bill, and then it wat> not the mere iatt that he did not sign it,
but the motives by which I believed he wasptompted m veto-
ing u I then measured and weighed all that had pas«?td I
give due importance to a long line of conduct and remarks that
I had before treated as havm been adopted or said without
meaning, ma spmtof levity or though tie***] e=-s and the con
viction was irresistible to my mind that tieaeheiy was coniem
plated, and I gave him up to°eive my country
In connection wuh thi*. submit I mu t advert to a letter I
wiotetothe President on the 10 h of August, six dnys befor«
the veto came, not simplvfo show my feelings towards him at
that time, but to cotrect an enoiieous impression th tt lias betn
formed upon tt
lhave heard it was whi*=peied about that I had written a let
ter to the President on the =«me da\ I had wnuen to Richmond
—to wit the 16th August—expressing sentiments of ihe most
friendly character, and the attempt has been ihu« made io con
vict me of duplicity, and the Madisoman itself intimates as
much No matter irom what source it cones I stamp it with
itlsehood—absolute aid unqualified falsehood Tms is dip
iett'i I wrote, as I befóte said siv days before the veto came
It was ad Iressetl to him as private and confidential, and Ido
not know by what ught tint l-ntei was spoken of by the Pie^i
