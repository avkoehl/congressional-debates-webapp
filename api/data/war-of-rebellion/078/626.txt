Major General S. D. LEE,

Commanding Dept. of Ala., Miss. and E. La., Meridian, Miss.:

GENERAL: I avail myself of the occasion of the going of Colonel J. H. Wingfield to your headquarters to report that from reliable information I learned that the enemy (Banks' army) had shipped six or seven boat loads of cavalry from Morganza to some point lower down on the Mississippi-whether to Port Hudson or Baton Rouge has not yet appeared. What their plans are I, of course, have not yet learned, but determined to move my command at once to Ascension Parish to procure as many mules and horses from the Government plantations as possible. I shall leave a sufficient force here to hold the enemy in check in the event of their moving out during my absence. If I am successful it will add greatly to the efficiency of my command, and if unsuccessful I shall see that they obtain no advantage over me. There are two stockade forts in Ascension guarded by about 500 cavalry each, without artillery, and while attacking them I shall threaten Baton Rouge, to prevent their getting in my rear. My force will be about 800 cavalry and four pieces of artillery. You will be duly informed of the result.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. S. SCOTT,

Colonel.
