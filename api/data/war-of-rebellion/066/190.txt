HEADQUARTERS HILTON HEAD DISTRICT, Hilton Head, S. C., July 29,1 864.

Respectfully returned to the major-general commanding, and his attention is invited to the accompanying report* of Captain Pickering, acting assistant inspector-general.

With the small force at our disposal, it is impossible to furnish a complete chain of pickets for the whole distance.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: On the 25th instant I sent out to the fleet, requesting to be furnished with some clock-work torpedoes. In reply, Captain Green, commanding naval forces before Charleston, informed me that he had none and knew nothing about them, but would forward my letter to Admiral Dahlgren at Hilton Head. I require these torpedoes to destroy the boom around Sumter, which is found, on examination, to exist on the right face, as well as on the right flank and gorge; until the destruction of which no mines can be brought properly in contact with the fort.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,
