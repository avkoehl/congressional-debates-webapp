Major CUTTING,Aide-de-Camp, Rappahannock Station:

The loaded trains are to remain at Rappahannock Station, ready to be move to the rear in case a demonstration is made to cut them off. If there is any cavalry with Colonel G., let him send them out to give timely warning of any danger, and should the enemy make a raid with a view of capturing the train, Colonel G., will fall back with his force, protecting the train. Unless there is some greater necessity for your presence there than is apparent to me, you will return by first train. Give the above as orders to Colonel Grimshaw.

Major-General.

If Major Cutting has left, give to Colonel Grimshaw.
