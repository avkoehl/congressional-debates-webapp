Colonel J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Your dispatch received. I have ordered four regiments to report to General Augur at Washington at once. On yesterday I sent two regiments and five companies to General Hunter as escort to a train. After sending the four regiments under your orders it will leave only one battalion Fifth New York Artillery at Harper's Ferry, one regiment Ohio National Guard at this post, one Ohio National Guard at Cumberland, and one Ohio National Guard at New Creek. Shall another regiment of those be sent before those now on the way to General Hunter have returned?
