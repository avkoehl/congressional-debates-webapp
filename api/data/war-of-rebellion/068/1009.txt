HEADQUARTERS,Petersburg, May 15, 1864.

General HILL, or

General MARTIN,

Swift Creek:

Be ready to march at daylight to-morrow morning with your brigade and the regiments of Colquitt. Have five days' rations and 60 rounds of ammunition. Report when all ready. Captain Blount's battery will accompany your brigade and should also be ready. As soon as the Sixty-fourth Georgia reports to you, cause it to relieve your outposts pickets and post their reserve as judiciously as you can. The order of march will be sent you to-night.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Petersburg, May 15, 1864.

General HILL:

Please send me the number of your bayonets. Do you want artillery? Any indications on part of enemy? South Side road cut 27 miles from here yesterday afternoon. Expect same on Weldon to-day. Then we must look out. How about your left flank?

Yours, truly,

W. H. C. WHITING.

MAY [15], 1864.

General HILL:

Don't move in the morning until I reach you. Orders changed. Have the whole force on Swift Creek ready to advance toward Walthall Junction in the best dispositions you think proper. I will come up with Wise and my whole available force - cavalry and all. We will advance. Beauregard has determined to attack, and directs me to advance, take position, and as soon as I hear his guns pitch in wherever I find anybody. This suits better. Send me your opinion as to where I had better order the cavalry.

Yours, truly,

WHITING.

Will send you copy of whole order as soon as deciphered.
HEADQUARTERS,Petersburg, May 15, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel TATE,

On Railroad between Petersburg and Weldon:

COLONEL: Move your regiment by railroad to Petersburg at once. Communicate the same order to the regiment of Kemper's brigade now on the road either at Hicksford or at Weldon.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
