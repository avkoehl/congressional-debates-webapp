some time at least, with the Federal authorities in New Orleans. He is the first citizen I have interfered with, and have postponed action a long time, from unwillingness to adopt any harsh steps.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.

HOUSTON, January 31, 1864.

Major General RICHARD TAYLOR,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have recently received information that there are six iron-clad double-turret gun-boats building in Saint Louis, for the purpose of operating on the coast of Texas. You may have possibly received some information in regard to them, and if such should be the case, I desire that you will communicate it to me at once.

I have the honor to request also to be informed of the number of iron-clad boats the enemy had or have now on the Mississippi River, and where they are or were at last accounts, and whether any of them would be able to come out of the Mississippi to the coast of Texas. General Smith is now here, and I desire that you will give me what information you possess on this subject as soon as possible.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. B. MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding.
