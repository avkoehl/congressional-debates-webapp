THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 26,
Mr. ANTHONY. I suppose I cannot make
a motion taking the floor from the Senator
from New Jersey, but if the bill takes time I
shall move on the first opportunity to postpone
it or any other measure for the purpose of
taking up the bill in regard to the publication
of the debates. I hope at any rate that as
soon as this bill is disposed of that will be
taken up.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from New Jersey declines to yield for that
purpose.
