nnnte 1 mo laid btfoie the members ofthe Senate, which was
a icque t lv hacíneles seen der led The bill proposed, in the
Pifcsent embarrasbed state of the Treasury, an appropriation
m mon-y of upwirdb of a million of dotlats for one <r two
States on'y.anUheiewasan amendment whirh measiuert out
somethmah! e equaljustice to others ofthe States ami he was
even denied a hearing on it Now Jin did not appear to him to
le either courteous or corred, but it was for fh- Senate to do
cide the question, and to them he would icav it w unout lui thei
we nark
Mi SEVIER opposed the amendmnnt was  againetactins on
if without the necessary surveys and estimates weie furnished
He had some little acquaintance with thib bill himself though
not so long as the Senator liom Missouri, because he had not
been so long n public lite But he hadalways seen that when
any specific object was in view, that suivey? were made, and
the estimates furnished The question was, shall we embaik
m it or not) If it was considered beneficial in a national point
of view, 1 ke the motion befoie us and anaporopnation was
made, it was generally considered that we were bound to go on
with it, and the appiopiiations weie made from time to time,
but m thfca^eof the amendment, we were asked to attach if to
a bill belonging to an exclusive object, without smveys, e^ti
mates, or any thin? to guide us m om reseaich He appealed
to the Senator not to embanass the bill, by insisting upon his
amendment Mr S¡ said he had no objection that the ¡senator
should obtain what he could foi puipoocs of internal improve
ments, and we all had, he presumed, the same object in view,
and hefMr S)ceitainly would not be veiy nice about getting
all he could for his own State He had objected to the amena
ment (f the Senator, not because he was opposed to the print i-
ples of the amendment, hut because it sought to attach to thf
bill befoie them, which had one specific object m view, crudo
and undigested bubjectf, that might prove Jaial  to it¡s pa°si£;e
Mr KI\0 could not but admit the exceeding libeiahij of
the honorable S natoi fiom Aikan as The gentleman went
for appiopnatiou aftci appiopnauon for roads m Arkansas I e
cause he said they weip "toads commenced and nnl csm
pleted" We appropriated the other day, said Mr K foi io?db
in Arkansas, and they were called military roads, because they
lead to atempoiary gairison, which the Secretary of War may
abandon at his pleasure But, continued Mi K whenwetned
to get a small appropriation foi a militar) load in Alabama, on
which twenty thousand dolíais had been expended, we could
not get lteithei on the plea of its h-vmg been commenced and
not completed, or of its being a mihtaiy road We were told,
said he that it was altogether unconstitutional, that when the
appropriation was fir¡?t made it was rightly done, because the
road was in the Indian country, but that now the Indian title
was extinguished, the State of Alabama mu^t make the load
herself He then tried to get th« road nut of the two per cent
fund belonging to his State, but this appropuation of a few
thousand was refused, onthegiound that the two per cent fund
was tobe rcseived for making loads leading to the State, and
this was within it
Now where was the evidence that this Cumberland road in
the State of Illinois, for which the bill appropriated $300,000,
was now commenced? Have you not heard the difficulty which
spiung up tin*! morning between the Sf nators fiom Missouri
and Illinois, ab to the location of the ioad! Was ita road com
menced when they did not know wheie it wab to be7 Because
that was* ciied the Cumberland road, and was commenced
fiom the t\\ o p^r cent fund, gentlemen seemed to be forgetting
all constitutional scruples with leganltoit But how much
beyond the two pei cent fund had bem expended on it* <U
least ten times a*? much Theie ntvt r wis so exti uagant an
expenditure of the public money, as had been male on some
partb of this road, ¿rid 9ttch % toadas s ime oonsideiable put
tion of it was not to be seen m anv count i y ■*■ veial veais
ago, when the Senatoi liom Kentucky took pirt in the debate
on this load bill, he showed that it w is not possible to conjunct
animpoitant part of it, wuhuut such tn ex:pen"e that ought
not to he thought ñf He showed conclusivtly, fiom the na
ture of the soil, and the scarcity and dearness of matenalb, that
it would involve an expense that ought not to be emountfied
The Senate, therefoie, limited the arpreptiationto the opening
of the road ¡Now they were called on foi thet-e heavy appro
pnations, without knowing wheie this load was to go, oi what
further expenets it would involve
Whether it was m the end to go to Texas or acio«s the
Rocky Mountains, and tei mínate at the mouth ofthe Columbia
nvei, they did not yet know He had looked at this Cumbei
land road ioi many yeaib It was an old oilendei igimstthe
Conmtution and law of the lái d &o much so, that gentlemen
who supported it had no mearib to^atisjy then constitutional
sciuplcs but by putting a dnect fraud m the bill A clau e in
the bill declared that the appiopnatnn wis to ho paid < ut of
the two pei cent íeserved toi making roads  to these States,
when ltwasnotouous that evciy doliai of this fund had been long
ai,o exhausted, and that there would notbeanothei cloliai of it
lot a hundred yeait> to conic He wa& sorry that he was obliged
to neat the subject m this manner but the pro) OMtio t of his
tuend from MiLhi-,an, (Mi JsoKVL,Li)soieasonable and bo jUbt
m itself, h ivm« been met it the nutlet with such ftienuoub
objections, he thought it light to inqime into the propriety of
continuing the bounty of the Government to two or three
Mates, and íeiuemg it to otheif, who had received nothing
With his ideas of the constitutional pnucipie involved, he was
compelled t announce at once that lie should vole against this
bill but yet he wished to t>ee an amendment w ide to it, which
would be doing something hke equal justice The onginal ob
¡ect m view wac to get across the mountains, tnd when that
was done, it ou^ht not to have gone farthei
Mi WALKIR was glad to hnd tl at the Senatoi fiom Ala
bama had taken up the subject It was not in that State alone
that the two pei ccot fund had been drained not f01 mal mg
roads in the ^iate, but leadin to the State When the two
States oí Mahima and JVii^i^ipp1 wanted am ppiüpnation foi
ínterin! improvement, it was voted down m the senate and
now we °e (said Mi W) two or thiee btates, that hive ie
ceived doiationc of millions of acre1! for purpo e^ f uuei nal
improvement, calluií upon an exhaustellrpaoury foi a mil
lion of dolíais, which we should i ive to bouow He wished
the tetmate to look at thet noimitj of such a mearme, and the
piejudinal heir ngit would nave upon the whole Confedeiaty
The people of Alton and St Louib wtie quanelmg aoout the
point at which the load should pas=!, and by am by we «should
ha\e the sime disputes about passing Texas  >i the llucky
Mountains If the Senate did not check it now, it would never
stop Mi W contended that the bill contained an open ftaud
on its face, by attempting to show th it the money wa  to be i e
pud tiiim the two pei cert fund, which, according to a re
poi t fiom the Secietary of the Treasuiy, was lc«s than half a
million of dolíais and woull never exceed one million and a
half, and jet we had already appropriated seven millions on
this tuo per cent and now one mon was asked f>r making
eight millions, to be refunded out of a fund that ne er could do
it The bill wii a palpable fraud noon the -very face of th°
document" and yt we were called upon to v^e foi u The
«j stem, «said Mr W if carried out, wo Id be partial an í my^t
m ad «shearing* it was not a national object, but. was foi the
benefit at most of three or four States, for which his f onstitu
ents were taxed fiom year to year, and the money takes out of
their poekets    Mr W said it was partial, miqmtousT and wi
just, and he, for one, would never see injustice oi inequality
pievail without lifting ,his voice against them
Mr SMITH of Indiana, said this was the old opposition re
newert with a laudable zeal The gentlemen from Alabama
and Mississippi had opposed the bill oh constitutional grounds,
and its friends had no right, therefore, to expect their support
Hi** views were directly the ie verse of theirs, and he should
led himself bound to vote font Mr S spidheconcurreden
tircly with the Senator from Mist-oun, (Mi Benton,) that the
bill sho^Jd stand on its  own bottom, and not have any thing ex
ti moons attached to it He had not examined the amendment
oilered by the Senator from Michigan, and would not, there
ioie, be considered as opposing it on i*s merits, hut simply be
cause it embraced objects new in themselves, and in no wise
connected with the p'ain and simple matter before them If,
whenevei the Senatoi from Michigan shouldsee fitto intioduce
a bill utatmg to any impoitant improvement in his Slate,
that Senatoi would always find him willing to give the measure
his cordial buppor, and he hoped the amendment would be
withdrawn and that the bill would not be further postponed
Mi SEVIER obscived that when he was up before, he had
no idea off discussion on the merits of the Cumberland load
He hid gnenhisicasons why the Senatoi from Michigan should
ji«j ptesb his amendment at this time, and the Senator from Al
ibanra, in íeplj mg to the íemarks he made, referred he hoped
not uomcally to his exceeding liberality He could say with
smcenty that theie was no Senator who<*e good opinion ne was
more desirous of íetaining than that ofthe Senator from Ala
bama, and he had always idled on him as the best authority for
the construction ofthe íules and the order of proceeding in the
Senate The Senatoi in the couise of his remarks, had brought
up the old subject of the Alabama road, and ha wo«ld, therefore,
inquue why that measiue had not befoie this been broughtbe
fore the Senate m the proper form Neither the Senatoi him
self, noi his colleague, nor the Alabama delegation in the othei
House, had ever thought of bringing it up except m the mannei
just done to embanass the bill before them
INow, he asked the Senatoi if this was consistent with line
rahty? The Senators from Mississippi and Alabama talked
much about the two per cent fund, and, with a commendable
?eal in favoi of the interests of their own Sfates, complained
that they could not haveioadb out of it withm their States
Butwheiewa-í the haidship oí the case? It was a bargain,
á.ná no one had a right to complain of it Again, the Senator
said that the insertion of a clause in the Cumberland Road bill,
that the appropnations were to be reimbursed out of the two
pei cent fund, was a palpable fraud, because the fund has been
long ago expended, and it, therefore, never can be reimbursed
He would ask his hi othei Jackson men how this clause came
to be m the bill i lie had voted against it, and it was struck out
bit, on the bill bemg sent to the other House, it was ascer
tamed that it would be \etoed without the clause, and it was,
(heiefoie, put in there by w ty of amendment, and, coming back
to the Senate passed tlnough, notwithstanding the constitutional
óctuples of gentlemen who had before voted against it Gcneial
lackson, the gieat Apollo of the South, requiied it to hold the
States to their bargain, and it was put in to remove his const i
tutional sci tiples and to sooth the consciences of his fnenda
To say theiefore, that this clause was a palpable fraud, came
with a bad giaci from gentlemen on that side, when it w a put
in to «satisfy their constitutional «crupiés He would ask the
benatoi if the clause was not struck out, and again inserted m
the way he had btated?
[Mr King The gentleman will find my vote against it
however ]
Mr SEVIER continued The gentleman from Alabama an-
nounced his constitutional objections to the bill, and that he
should vote agamst it m any event, why, therefore, did hem
siston tacking this, amendment to if He was surprised that
the Senttoi, who was so particular in his adhering to rules
an I established cu to nib, should be willing to bung manap
pi opt ration of the importance oí that in the amendment, with
out estimates, without smveys,mid without any information
\vhatc\ei on the subje* t Suppose (*=aid Mr g ) we pass the
bill with this amendment It wi'l go the other House andbe
bpopped there, because that body never will pass an appiopna
tion, without having the estimates, and all othei necessary m
formation befoie them And more the President who piofesses
to foil vv m the footsteps of his piedecessor will veto the bill,
because it contans new objects, and then we shall have no
Cumberland road atall Astobouowmg money, which \\as
so much dieaded by the Senator from Mississippi, he saw
nothing so very alarming m it We had borrowed money be
tore, and if it was foi a pioper object, theie would be no harm
in hoi rowing it again
Mi JsORVELL said it was a little extraoidmary to him that
the Senatoi from Arkansas should talk about suiveys and est!
mates, and old and newroads, when the piuposinon \v*b n< t for
the conístiuptinn of a mad, but for a cr intofland to c nam of
the new States foi the pm poses of internal improvement* who
liad hitherto received nothing ot the kind—a grant which had
been mile seveial times befoie When he made the propobi
tion to mend the bill, it was done in good faith, and, if the
amendment pi evaded, he should vote for the bill, piovided the
clause about itimbui'-ement was stricken out But he could
not, consisten!ly with his ideas of justice, vote for it without
the amendment
Mi "\0UISG was again&t the adoption of the amendment
The course pursued bygenilemen was of a very extiaordimiy
nature—a kind of dog and manger policy Because they could
not get what they wanted, they would vote against the bilí
such t piocteding was suicidal g|The whole countiv had been
ni( e oi Jess benefited by tht Cumberland road and ho hoped
gentlemen would not now seek to embarrasb oi defeat it
1 he little dispute about the point of crossing, between the
people of A'ton and St Louis, had been adverted toas a source
of object on but in his opinion that had no connection w ith thp
matter befoie the Senate and could at any time be adjusted by
the people of their respective Siate^ without trouble Mi \
coniended that the measure was one of peculiar benefit, m
which a great portien of the States werp interested and spoke
of tht wide evtended prairies of the West, thiongh which the
mads weie at times almost impassable Mr Y conrludtd his
remaiká by expressing an earnest wish that gentlemen ttouH
not puroae a policy so unwi e and <?o illiberal
Mr WALKER repüfcd that there < ouJd be no iv.ore ju*t
