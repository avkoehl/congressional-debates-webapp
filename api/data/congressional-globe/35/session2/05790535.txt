Your honorable body will at once perceive that no mo-
tion, concunent or jomt-resolution, for electing Senators,
or othei piopo^tion for that purpose, had been pieviou-ly
made or attempted. The Senate had never been invited by
the House, or the House by tiie Senate, to join, participate
in, or consent to, any ?uch election or elections. The ob-
ject, if there wan an object, was studiously concealed ; at
lea-t, so far as the journals ot eitner House show. The
election thus held, by which the present incumbents claim
theirseats, wa& without the knowledge, consent, or partici-
pation, of a quorum of cither House of the General Assem-
bly; and, notwithstanding a majority of the membeis, per
capita, of tbe two Houses may have assented to and taken
pait m the piocecdin^s of said meeting, any election thus
had could ceitainly ha\e no binding torce when the meet-
in" itself was void. That there was not a quotum of the
Scnatois piesetu 111 the above meefnu. if additional evi-
dence 1^ wanting, your memorialist would v< ter your hen-

(he question whether she will be permitted herself to select,
! among her own citizen?, the persons whom she chooses to-
represent her in your branch ofthe Federal Legislature, or
whether unauthorized parties, acting .in a revolutionary
manner, and in conflict with her organic law, but assuming
to act for her, jn her name, and on her behalf, shall beper-
mittcd to choose her representatives?
Your memorialist would here express an entire and undi-
minished confidence in the disposition of your honorable
body to carry outand exemplify in all your decisions affect-
in? the lights of States; as well as individuals, the spirit
contained in the words of the preamble to tiie Constitution
of the United States*. In the full assurance that tiiat wjU
predominate in tins as in all other important issues, your
memorialist apprehends no conflict between the national
and State sovereignty, but will cherish, to the end, the as-
surance that justice and equity will prevail throughout, and
eminently characterize the result of the application herein
made. With this view of the matter your memonalist can-
not regard, as any serious obstacle to an equitable adjust-
ment of her light,the decision already made in behalf of
; the incumbents. That decision-was made upon 11'prima
I fane" evidence of an inferior order, while now your uie-
'moiuilistcome-5 in her own proper peison with the Unques-
1 turned and unquestionable authority of an act of herLe^is-
j lature. Your memoual^t fully appreciates the fact th-at
1 youi lionoiable body is the only tubunal befoie which &uch
, questions can be med, and that fiom its decisions there is
j no appeal, there being above and beyond it no higher or even
J equal povvet. Out your nicmoiiahst woul.d s-eek no other
; tubunal. or question the right to the exorcise of the power
in the decision that has been made, but icivm<?on that sense
I of jiHtiee winch undeilies all of our institutions, but do-
; mauds ]n the ttibmiai of your lionoiable body a leview or
ieijoarin,i, tueh as the meanest suiter would net be denied
: m the hi4he-=t pidicial court known to the laws of the land.
I It may not be mappropi late foi your memorialist to suggest
I th'it any othei couise on the part of your lionoiable body
nn."ht be productive of the most alaimui? consequences j
for il anv number of the States of the Union should be so
unfortunate, your memorialist, as to haveeonfeired upon
, individual-, whom they hafa not chosen, ciedentiaH of elec-
tion a?. Dinted States Senatms. and your honorable body,
npon such credential<, would admit them asv meipbers, it
I, would not be a sutiicient answer to sueh State?, when ap-
I ply em for icdte-sand demanding their rights,that the Sen-
i ate ot thoUmted States had once passed upon the question,
! and that hei power wa« already exhausted on the subject.
; Vmii luemoiiuhst holds to tiie doctrine that the power
I. looked in youi lionoiable body to do justice to, and deal
: equitably with, those who delegated to you that power, can
1; 'ie\er be ovluusted, howcvci often u may have been ex-
f eu-i-ed, until =iieh nn-iu-e has been done m the mosi com-
plefe and ample manner. Any othei view of tiiat power
j; \/ouid make nan nre-ipotwible, mdependentauthonty, fully
,' aimed joi \enhance uu<i wionsr. but powerless for {he ae-
!■ compiMiment of those wise and beneficent purposes for
II which it was established. Lleeogmzins 111 tiie economy of
I1 both State and Fuhna! Government the piineiplc that ev-
j erv tin ni; sr.hit.uy depends upon the, consent ot the governed,
1 youi iiiemnnnh-it cannot regaul the argument of a want of
■ po\ -ei>m youi honoiablo body to review and ievise its de-
I i )sjtin<5 ih at iili in hfiimony w ith the spirit of our institu-
1 ti<>n<, or consonant with (he almost unlimited power dole-
! gated to the national Legislature. Such a concession, on
j the pa it ofthe seveial Stales, would be equivalent to asur-
[ render of thou lurhts, without whtelr they would cease to
| h" sovere'211 power--, and de=eend to die condition ofeolo-
j ui-r>; whei em thev would be compelled to the support of a '

) Sta'es winch has hitherto marked her^-ady and willing ac-
