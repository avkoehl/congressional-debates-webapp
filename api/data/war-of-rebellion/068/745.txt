HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,City Point, Va., May 13, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commanding Department of Virginia and North Carolina;

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your note to General Hinks of this date. General Hinks is now at the point opposite General Smith's headquarters. Colonel Duncan, with the Fourth and Sixth Regiments U. S. Colored Troops and two sections of artillery, left for that point yesterday morning, and the fortifications by this time must be well advanced.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SOLON A. CARTER,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

IN THE FIELD,

Near Drewry's Bluff, May 13, 1864-9 a.m.

Rear-Admiral LEE,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

Would it not be possible for you to bring up the gun-boats, monitors, opposite Dr. Howlett's, so as to cover our flank on the river and relieve a considerable body of my troops? Both sides of the river there are low and flat, and it is an excellent point for the gun-boats to lie.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

MAY 13, 1864.

Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE:

I think it would be of great public service if you can put your boats so as to cover my landing for supplies at Howlett's house.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

FLAG-SHIP MALVERN,

Brigade Reach, James River, May 13, 1864-6 p.m.

(Via Fort Monroe, 14th. Received 6.30 p.m.)

Honorable GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

General Butler asks for monitors above Trent's Reach. Torpedoes, commanded by rebels on the left bank, which commands our deck, and shoal water, by chart, by several feet less than the monitors draw, make difficult the advance, which I shall push to-morrow morning. We have discovered another kind of torpedo, of which the enemy is making much use. No news from Richmond. General Butler had yesterday advanced near Drewry's Bluff.

S. O. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
