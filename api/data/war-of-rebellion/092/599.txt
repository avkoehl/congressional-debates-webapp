The march will be continued to-morrow in the same order as to-day, toward Millen. Each division will start at 6 a. m.

During the march to-morrow each brigade commander will send out a foraging party of fifty men, to fill, as far as possible, all the forage and subsistence wagons, gathering all the sweet potatoes and other vegetables that can be found. These parties can be sent out on the flanks of the column for a distance of two miles, within which limit an abundance of all required stores can be found. Under no circumstances will any party be allowed to forage in advance of the column, and any party so found will be arrested. All foragers must be provided with a pass and authority, as required by existing orders. Colonel Hughes, commanding cavalry, will arrest and send to the rear all unauthorized persons found straggling in front of the column. Attention is again called to the existing orders prohibiting unauthorized firing by foragers.
