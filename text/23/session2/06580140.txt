Union, to ¡strike out the 12tn, 13 h, and 14th hues,
malting an appropriation of $3U,0üO foi the forti-
fication on Throg's Neck, neai the city of New
Yoik
Mr PARKER repeated the objections which
he entertained against the appropriation He
wished Congiess to examine and understand it,
or m the language of the homely adage, " look
before you leap " He read several documents
íelative to the work, which computed its cost at
^577,000 He thought the gieat question with
the House should be, whethei the money could
not be expended to better advantage in other for-
tifications He considered all ap[ lopiiations for
this object, a waste of the publiv. funds He
believed Ilellgate lo he a better and surer protec-
tion to the city of New York, from that point of
the compass, than the fortifications on fhiog's
Neck could evei be Ml P said he remembered
that during the last war, no one anticipated an
attack of the enemy from that quailer Mr P
concluded by saying that he opposed this afipio-
priation as a fnend to the bill, and the general
system of fortification He deemed it not only
useless, but calculated to excite ridicule
Mi MORGAN, of New York, said that the ap
propna'ion for the defence of New York haiboi,
now moved to be strieken out, was certainly not a
large one     He had not exnected, theiefore, that
any gentlerr-an would move to have it stricken
out, least of all had he expected that the gentle-
man fiom New Jeisey would have made such a
motion     lhe gentleman from New Jersey vas
our neighboi, our next door neighbor, but it is
true that he is our neighboi on the safe side    The
gentleman   lesides   on   those  pleasant shores   of
New Jersey which lo m the western bounuary of
New Yoik harboi, and tho eshoies, includ ngthe
gentleman's residence, are well piotected by the
forts on Staten Island,and theotherislands mthat
part of the haibor     But how is it m respect to
the approach to the city of New York from the
sea, on the other side, that is, by the arm of the
sea, called the Sound, or East mei >   Very differ-
ent indeed     There is not a gun mounted, nor a
propel  place to mount it on, between  the sea,
and the city, and your navy-yard      O i this side,
the city of New York is now exactly in the con-
dition that a house would be, the owner of which,
feanngan enemy, had seemed one door with bolts
and bars, ano eh ¡ms and locks   and enMrely for-
getting that theie was anoth°i door to his house,
had left it open to the assailant     Indeed, the gen
tleman who made the mo ion to strike out, seemed
to think that the formidable pas , which he called
Hellgate, would be a«nffio eit defence to us     But,
sir,even the terror of a name did not exis^for our
defence, for learned antiquaries and etymologis s
had shown that the name of this pasáis Huil-
gate<—not   Hellgate      In   the   olden   time,  the
rocks producing the rapid nnd  roiring cuirents
of this pass, were indeed  objects of terror to the
nn"kilful navigators of those deys     They were
as temblé to our mcestois as were the Scylla rnJ
Charybdis of the Italian seas     But Hurlgate and
Scylla and Chaiybdis, have been  alike suipred
of then terrors bj the ski 1 ■> id eiterpuseof mod-
ern ti i s   Sir, tes els of all s zes may go through
this pass with  perfect safety     There is not an
noui ot the day when it is not whitened by mnu-
meiable ¡sails   the whole coasting trade, the larg-
est steam boats are cons artly passirg thiough it
The fust case, Í believe, of the passage of a large
shrp through Huitgate, occuned during the revo-
lutionary war      A  British fifty  gun  snip, com-
manded by a namesake of the honorable gentle-
man from New. Jersey, thegal'antParktr, pursued
by a Piench squadron, was carried by him safely
| through this pass     Durirs the last war between
England and Fiance, two French ships of the line,
the Dido and the Cyane, passed  it, to avoid a
Btitish squadron at Sand y Hook     In the late war,
our own frigates ot the laigest class went through
it, the President I believe diu so—that ship which
was lost to us by carrying away part of her false
Keel m passing the bar of Sandy Hook, that er-
trance to New York harhor, which is acknowledged
to be well fortified     There is not a doubt, Mr
Speaker,   that the  passage   of the Sound, the
