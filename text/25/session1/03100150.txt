added that there was a change since then ] The

capital emana atea from the dominion of the
Bank of Englai d in 1826'' was not br nkmg, for
the first time, se fiee in the gieat commercial and
manufacturing districts Sir, I hive travelled a
little, too I have con'emplaled with delight the
rich treasures of the Louvre and of the Vatican, the
sublime done ai 1 the proud corinthian, but it was
m the beautiful vallev s of Trance and Gei many—on
the Rhine and on the Elbe—it was amidst the moun-
tains of Switzerland ?nd Wa'es that I saw, with-
out regard to questions of currency, oí < ven forms
of government, sound moralnj and peisonal com-
fort, it was these scenes that reminded me of our
western paradise And, sir, I cou'd but regret
that the tenants of those mountains and valleys
were governed by that concentrate! powci of asso-
ciated wealth wheh rules Governments controls
monarchs, and regulates the destiny of every nation
in Europe
Mr Chairman, we have a gieat constitutional
duty to discharge We have to regulate the coin-
age, and by requiring the collection of our rev enue
in a common medium, to secure equal taxation to
the Slates of this Confederacy, and lo preserve for
the whole people a measure of value of ancient
origin, for labor, pioperty and contracts In dis-
charging this dutj, we have not only to encounter
the vices of our complicated bankm i systems, but
aLo a revolution vv inch has been going on more
than a century, and one which threatens in the end
to substitute a mere exchange of credits for the
ancient standard of nations It commenced with
the charter of the "Bank of England, in 1694
This substitute first appeared in the form of notes
of twenty pounds in 175'), it w is reduced to (en
pound", in l'lj ti fi e piumK anlin 1797 ibe
bank suspended spec c piymc I nd i un ence I
issuing one and two pound notes Aftei a iatal
experiment of five and twenty yeais—fatal to the
morals and welfare of the people, how ever neces-
sary it may have been to Government—the bank
resumed specie payments in 1823 The currency wis
reformed, and all notes under five pounds (about
equal to twenty-five dollars) were piolnbited in
England and Wales This was not, however, the
most material leform
The restriction on banking, which had been
imposed m 1708 to protect tin monopoly of th>
Bank of England, was repelled in l^2(> f oí o ie
hunched and eight'en yeais no assu'iatun could
be formed foi banking purposes with mor< th?n siv
ppriners lindel this system, tl e t ade and cut-
renev of England w eie peiu d c ill) coin ulsed The
gieat regulatoi of banking m that eounirv, by its
own alaims and powerful efforts to \i,e itself,
biought down country banks by the hundred in
every revulsion, prostrated trade, and fhtcw mil-
lions of the laboring population out of employment
The violent revulsion of 1S25 brought about the
reform of 1826, and "with the co ¡sent" of the
Bank of England, her monopoly was partially le-
hnquisbed, and the gieat commercial and manufac-
turing district  were permitted, like Scotland, to
form as many b inks as the} please 1 England has
escaped some of tne violence of the lecent revul-
sion Her banks have not suspended specie pay-
ments The Bank of England was not saved, as
li 1895, bv an acciden'al distoveiy" of one pound
notes' It was net because there had not been
over-trading m England, far otheiwi e ThQie
nev r was a penod when theie was more exten-
sive speculation in ever} branch of trade, and
when hei cppital and cr dit weie moie widelv
extended in ev°ij qu r ei ol th1 globe How has
it happened, then, that she d d no' suffer asm 182')"'
Because the revuls'on in that yen broke down the
monopoly of the Bank f England, because
capital, freed from its dominen, flowed with
astonishing rapidity mto that branch of trade,
and was rcaK to meet the sudden and large
a Id tion which speculat on had made to the ma^s of
commercial crej ts Some of these associations, it
is true, weit embarrassed by'the revulsion, the
wonder is that mor" weie not brought down  by it
They were pll of i cent orig.n, ''nd this trade had
been efftctuat!., prohibited for moie than acentuó
These were not the only reform  That remnant
of barbarism, the usury law, was also in eflect le-
pealed, by exempting all bills having not more
than ninety days to run from their opeiation, and
this has been subsequent!) extended The rate of
interest, sir, is the safety-v alv e of credit It should
be permitted to rise and fall with the pressure upon
the money market In thif counfiy -we have
locked it down, and doubly ffi hibited the fr e use
of capital The inevitable con equence ib periodi-
cal explosions But with all these reforms, a is
still the policy of England to substitute credit for a
metallic measure of value That cieftit, u is true,
is not so vitiated as it was, but by making B"nk of
England notes a lawful lendei, and by authorising
the joint stcck associations to ssue their not^s re-
deemab'e m these notes, they hue laid the fonnda-
tion ior levuKions m trade, which are not vet de-
veloped These associations had not been long
enough m existence to show to what an ount they
could increase then circulations, thonah tong enough
to prove how rapidly they cou d increase them
While the use of credit founded ipon propel ty
should enjoy absolute freedom the abuse of credit,
by issuing that which is fe unded upon cred t, ^h iuld
never be encouraged by Government
The most powerful pntagonist, however, of a
uniform measure of value is our own banking sjs-
tem,unquestionably the worst m the world If we
we had no other motive, we should be compelled
to collect our revenue in a metallic cm rent), in or-
der to pieserve something in the country asa stand-
ard of value We have six and twenty Legisla
tures and two Territorial Councils steadil) at woik
t nacting laws to banish specie from cncuht on
The pitsent crisis, no doubt, must produce reform,
but it can not be expec ted to be immediate oi ge-
iieial, so lon„ as our Isus are mpde bv tnose who
enteitun hostile pi iciplcs ol D ivei imtnt, esp ci tl
h on this question ot cunenc v it is tine, thire is
a common convict on that oui ban! ing sv stem is
bid, and that our local c ■'euiations íequire reloim,
but when will that over be effected, if we sunender
up our constitutional standaid? If we do not lay
the foundation here, our banking system will nei ei
be reformed It is impossible to imagine a }stem
more discordant, and more embarrassing to trade,
than the sj stem of the United St ites as a vv hole
Capital is not at liberty to flow mto this branch of
trido as m England and Scotland Government

for a metallic stan lard, with libeity to increase wd
d nvnish it at pie isure, fo1- that is the result whith
sterns approaching    The gieat question to be de-
termined is, art tr ding associations to be autho-
nzed to issup a spec es of State ere-it, and to col-
lect a rev enu", now amounting to sit or seven
millions annually, and constantly increasing, and
to indemnif} an abused commi nity by producing
periodical bankruptcy, poverty, and wantf The
gentleman f^om South Carolina knows that almost
all the distinguished authorities aie against his
"credit sj stei 1 "
| It is a conceded point, that the regulation of the
quantity of currency w hich is the measure of value,
ought not to be entrusted to those whose profits are
( increased by abus ng the tract Yon might as well
at once surrender to these corporations the power
to regulate the value of our com, and let them
adul erate it oi prbitianly raise its nominal value
at their pleasure, as monarchs formerly did, to the
mm of their people Upon what ground is it that
Governments have been induced to give their aid
in substituting the paper of trading companies for
the eurient com of the -worldl An increasing de-
mand for a medium of circulation and a deficiency
of the precious metals The fermei is admitted,
the latter I denv, and on neither ground can these
issues -be defended Sir, there has been no age of the
world when it was so abundantly supplied with
circulat on, independent of all the small notes (I
mean under fifty or one hundred dollars) in Europe
and America How is it with the precious metals'
In the work referíed to by the gentleman from
South Caiolina, the quantity oí money m the
Augustan ?ge is esumat d at less than two thou-
sand millions Why, sir, since 1492, we have
diawn from the American mines alone, moie than
six thousand millions of dollar , and the aggregate
of com, bullion, and plate m the world, is estimated
at fiom seven to ten thousand millions The quan-
tity of specie mi^ht have been an object of solicitude
m eailier ages, but of what consequence is it now,
when, foi Hits great offices, we have discovered
oth r substitutes We have discovered a mine
ruber than ad the mines of Mexico and Peru—the
human mind We have drawn fiom that inex-
haustible mine, countless millions of substitutes for
specie, in the foim of public debts, bank stocks,
and stocks of ev try kind, of bills of exchange,
notes of hand, batik draUs, and bank checks.
These are oui circulations which give -velocity lo
trade It is these, amounting to thousands of mil-
lions, which have accelerated the growth of
wealth among nations, and not the contemptible
amount of your small note circulations m Great
P>i tain, heland snd Arc erica In the piessnt age,
tn !e pi ovules its own suhsh utes for ecie, in ad-
justing bil?ncns not onlvbetween States and Na-
tions, but between individuals, ?nd without the
agency of ba k notes Specie is only wanted to
adjust balances between mtitns when credit is
suddenly destroyed It s how ever wanted in every
country as a stmdard for local circulation, and to
sustain   the   meicas ug   pmonnt  ot   commercial
■ credit The vakie oi pioperty is sufficiently affec-
ted b} credit fojnicd upon credit, in the foim of
bills of ex hangi , without extending this abuse of
ere lit in th1 form of currency The former we
can noi reach bv legislation, ?nd vv e hav e no right
to do so if we could, however injurious its opera-
tion is upon trade The latter mtei feres with the
cu rencv established by the Constitution, and we
should adopt every measure that we canto prevent
it fiom destroying oir standard altogetiei.
This revolution n oybe accomplished The pre
cious me alo mav eventually be banished from the
circulations of the worid, and we may have no
other standard than bank n^tes I admit, sir, that
as a mere question of trade it would acce'erate the
pccumulation of wealth, and tbe giowth of our
cities But wnat are the sacrifices attending such
a system? Do }ou not 1"} the foundation of your
cities on the ruin of yoar population1 Sir, while
ve sacrifice the poor, we transfer political power
fiom tht agnculluial and laboring classes of society
to those thousand corporations w hich seem to have
been, iiom the begi inn  of our free Governments,
i the only interests worthy, in the estimation of our
American legislators, to be exclusively cherished,

I tabhsh } ourpaper standard, and let the value of pro-
