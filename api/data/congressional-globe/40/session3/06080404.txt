THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 15,
Their shores are the boundaries of eight great
States, whose population in 1870 will exceed
18.000,000 — quite one half the population
of the entire Union. New York has a coast-
line upon these great waters nearly equal to
that of Spain upon the Mediterranean ; Ohio
more than that of Prance; Michigan more than
Italy; and Pennsylvania and Indiana, each
with their single port, have as broad afoot-
hold upon these waters as Phoenicia or Ven-
ice, when each from its single port ruled the
commerce of the world.
The commerce of these lakes in 1818 was less
than $1,000,000-, in 1841 it was $65,000,000;
in 1856 it was $608,000,000, and now exceeds
$1,000,000,000 in annual value. The growth
o( this commerce cannot be better illustrated
than by the growth of the shipping by which
it is moved. In 1818 there was but a single
steamer and forty sailing vessels, only two of
which exceeded 100 tons burden, on all the
lakes above the Niagara river. In 1833 the
number of vessels upon all the lakes was esti-
mated at 665, averaging about 110 tons each,
in 1860 they had increased to 1,600. But in
1868, as shown by the last report of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury, their number was 2,681,
averaging about 200 tons each. The anthra-
cite coal of Pennsylvania forms an important
item in the trade of the lakes, the production
of which has increased from less than 365 tons
in 1820 to more than 12,000,000 tons in 1868.
Hut much the greater part in bulk and value
of this vast and growing commerce is the food
production of the western States on its way
to market in the eastern States, or passing
through the eastern States on its way to for-
eign markets. The relations which the east-
ern and western States bear to each other in
the matter of food, demand and supply, can be
best illustrated by a few facts from the census
reports.
The population of the eight northeastern
States, to wit, the six New England States,
with New York and New Jersey, in 1850, was
6.315,055. The population of the same States
in 1860 was 7,678,050, showing an increase of
1,362,098. The production of wheat in the
same States in 1850 was 15,813,582 bushels,
and in 1800 was 11,521,513 bushels. The pro-
duction of corn in the same States in 1850 was
36,793,970 bushels, and in 1860 was 38,883,913
bushels, showing a falling off in the production
of wheat ot 4,292,069 bushels, an increase in the
production of corn of only 2,089,943 bushels,
and a falling off in the aggregate production of
2,102,129 bushels. The supply of food pro-
duced in those States prior to 1850 was insuffi-
cient for their population, and yet with an
increase in population of more than one mil-
lion and a quarter in 1860, there had been a
falling off in the home supply of these great
siaples of human food of more than two mil-
lion bushels; and the census of 1870 will un-
doubtedly show thatthisincreaseof population
and deficiency of food production in those
States has been maintained.
1 he wheat crop in the seven northwestern
States, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Michigan, Wis-
consin, Iowa, and Minnesota, in 1850, was
40,800,886 bushels, and the corn crop 185 -
993,965 bushels. In 1860 the wheat crop of
t ie same States was 88,606,017 bushels, and
the corn crop 319,397,474 bushels; showing
an increase m wheat of 47,806,631 bushels, in
corn of 133,403,509 bushels, and in the aggre-
gate of 181,210,140 bushels, or 4,774,248 tons,
or more than the entire weight of all articles
carried upon all the canals of the State of
New lork in the year 1865. And this aggre-
gate, if not ratio of increase of production® has
undoubtedly heen maintained to the present
lime, since the corn crop of the three States
oi', 80Q Rsai\ L"?8' a"d Iowa in 1866 was
woo.808,881 bushels, or more than that of the
whole seven States in 1860.
The average price of corn in the three last-
mentioned States in the year 1866, as shown
by^ the report of the Commissioner of Agri-
culture for that year, was 44 cents per bushel
while m New York it was $1 16, in Con-
necticut $1 26, and in Massachusetts $1 34
per bushel. An addition of five cents a bushel
to the value of the corn crop of those States for
that year, by an improvement of the facilities
for transportation, would have added to the
wealth of these three States $16,794,444, or
one and one third the entire cost of the pro-
posed canal. These figures not only show the
sources from which the deficiency of food in
the eastern States is to be supplied, but also
show that the demand for a market at the West
is as imperative as the demand for food at the
East, and that the interests of each require
that the communication between them shall be
made as cheap and as accessible as possible.
That communication is, and always will be,
mainly by the great lakes; and when we
add the 4,000,000 of New England to the
18,000,000 who inhabit the States bordering
on those waters and Iowa, we find more than
half of the population of the Union immedi-
ately interested in the improvement of their
channels of intercommunicationandthoreduc-
tion of the cost of transportation upon them.
How shall this be accomplished? We affirm
that the only way in which it can be done is
by establishing upon our own soil a communi-
cation between Lakes Erie and Ontario which
shall enable any craft ordinarily navigating
either of those lakes to reach the other with-
out difficulty, and this for two reasons :
First. The ports upon Lake Ontario are
more numerous, nearer, and more accessible
to the great centers of demand and consump-
tion of western products than those at the
eastern extremity of Lake Erie, and with equal
access to the western lakes can more cheaply
transport those products to their consumers,
and convey also to the West the eastern mer-
chandise and manufactures which they need.
Second. The competition thus established
between the ports upon Lakes Erie and Ontario
will keep the charges upon each at a point of
reasonable profit; and should these channels
become clogged, or the charges upon them for
any reason become excessive, the way will be
opened to the St. Lawrence, which ever points
the way of unbroken water communication to
the distant ocean, and thus will always operate
as a valuable check upon the charges by the
other route. *
The fear that with the construction of this
canal our own channels of communication will
not be able to compete on even terms with the
route of the St. Lawrence is founded upon a
want of acquaintance with the facts of the case.
I he Canadian ports on the north shore of Lake
Ontario, which have access now to this route,
notwithstanding their natural prejudice in favor
ot their own route, send quite as much grain to
Great Britain hy the way of Oswego and New
^ ork as by the St. Lawrence. The entire
exportation^of grain from Canada to Great
Britain and Ireland by the way of the St. Law-
rence in 1866 was 3,334,812 bushels, while the
amount of grain received from Canada at the
port of Oswego alone during the same year was
5.854.187 bushels, a great part of which was on
its way to Great Britain by the way of New
York. But we are assured by my colleague,
the honorable gentleman from Buffalo, thatthe
construction of this canal will notimprove the
communication between the East and the West,
because the Welland canal now connects Lakes
Erie and Ontario, and its business is steadily
decreasing. I admit the fact of the decrease,
and desire to call the attention of the House to
the reason ; for that reason is the controlling
one why this bill should pass, aside from the fact
that our commerce should have its own chan-
nels, and not be dependent upon those of a
rival, and possibly hostile foreign country.
Twenty years ago no vessels were built upon
the lakes for the purpose of carrying freight
that were not adapted to the locks upon the
Welland canal, so that they might at pleasure
take freight to ports either upon Lakes Erie or
Ontario. At that time freight could be carried
cheaper by Oswego than by Buffalo. With the
increase of the volume of commerce upon the
lakes, and with the deepeningand improvement
of the St. Clair flats and of the entrances to
lake harbors, there has been since that time an
increase in the size of vessels built upon the
lakes and a larger proportion of the upper lake
fleet from year to year which could not pass
the locks of the Welland canal and were thereby
excluded from the ports upon Lake Ontario.
As this proportion increased the ability of
Oswego to compete with Buffalo on equal terms
continually grew less. I append hereto a state-
ment prepared by a Buffalo authority, showing
that in 1857 the cost of transportation was less
by Oswego; that the difference grew steadily
less until 1863, when it changed in favor of
Buffalo and has siftce steadily increased in the
same direction:

The fact th at a vessel carrying 30,000 bushels
of wheat to Buffalo is navigated with the same
number of men and at about the same ex-
pense as a vessel carrying 16,000 bushels which
can pass the-Welland canal to Oswego, added
to the fact that a large part of the upper lake
fleet from the size of the vessels is absolutely
excluded from Lake Ontario, will show that
no fair competition does or can exist between
the two routes. We yet receive six or seven
million^ bushels of western grain, about half of
which is consumed in our own manufactures
of flour and starch, but Oswego and other
Lake Ontario ports are no longer dangerous
competitors of their great rival, Buffalo, for
the commerce of the West, and their power to
regulate excessive charges upon that com-
merce is gone and will not return until by
the construction of this canal or some similar
work they are again made equal rivals for the
trade of the West.
Whether the West or the East can afford to
have competition lessened while the volume of
trade is so wonderfully increasing is for them
to determine. Oswego has a capacity in her
elevators and warehouses and canal and rail-
road facilities to handle the entire eastern move-
ment of western grain, could that movement
be distributed equally over the whole period of
lake and canal navigation ; but her vast facil-
ities are comparatively useless for the effect
they ought to have, and, with the construction
of the Niagara ship-canal, would have upon
the charges of transportation between the East
and the West.
To show the capacity of the Oswego canal
and the growth of its business I append hereto
a statement, of the entire movement of freight
upon it for the last twenty-one years :

from and arrived at Oswego, by canal, for a series
