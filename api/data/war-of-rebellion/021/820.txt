HEADQUARTERS SUB-MILITIA DISTRICT OF HOUSTON,Houston, Tex., October 1, 1862.

Captain SAMUEL BOYER DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, &amp;c.:

SIR: I received a report from Beaumont, stating that on Saturday, 26th instant, in the evening, the Federals came with two launches, about 50 in number, inside of Taylor's Bayou and attempted to destroy the railroad bridge. Their attempt was unsuccessful; the bridge was repaired in two hours. They arrested three men who live near the bridge, probably to exact information from them. The bridge is not guarded. I shall send Major Kellersberg to Beaumont and Orange to erect a field work for the protection of the bridge at Beaumont and to command at Orange the navigation of the river. I must protect from an attack Niblett's Bluff, which is our great thoroughfare to Louisiana. Troops ought to be stationed there, but I have no infantry to send and besides it is situated in Louisiana. If I can do no better I shall use at Beaumont and Organe three mortars which here, although these pieces can be of little advantage against a moving object like a launch.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

X. B. DEBRAY,

Colonel, Commanding Sub-Military District of Houston.

P. S.-The yellow fever is reported at Matagorda.
