GENERAL: Colonel Irwin being unwell, I am directed by him to acknowledge receipt of your note of 30th March. Colonel Holabird left here yesterday on the Laurel Hill. Captains Hawes and Mahler have been informed of the importance of immediately forwarding all available light-draught steam-boats, and both have assured me that they are doing all that they can in this matter. Captain Mahler reports that the steam-boats Shreveport and James Battle will leave for Alexandria this p. m., at 4 o'clock and 6 o'clock, respectively; that the Sallie Robinson and Mittie Stevens are coaling preparatory to immediate departure for the Red River, and the Red Chief, Starlight, and Louisiana Belle are undergoing necessary repairs, on the completion of which they will be loaded and sent at once. I am also directed to inclose copy of telegram sent you this a. m., informing you that the steamer Laurel Hill left yesterday afternoon without the headquarters mail, and stating the reason therefor; also copy of the pass held by the orderly charged with the mail. Colonel Irwin further directs me to say that he will have this matter thoroughly investigated at once.
