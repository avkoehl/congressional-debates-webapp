Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Scouts report that John H. Morgan, with 6 of his officers, was at the 8-mile post on the Livingston, and Sparta road going toward Sequatchie Valley last Friday night. He refused to allow some of his former command to accompany him for fear of being discovered before passing our line.

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, December 17, 1863.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Knoxville:

I will try to send you stores to Loudon. You must get them from there by rail. Collect all the stores you can in East Tennessee this winter. A great battle may be fought in East Tennessee next spring, and stores must be collected for the subsistence of a large army. We are building boats here which will enable me, I hope, to send many stores from here.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, December 17, 1863.

Major General J. G. FOSTER,

Knoxville, Tennessee:

Keep General Granger's force as long as it may be necessary to do so, but order them back when you feel your position perfectly secure. If you find it necessary for the efficiency of his command, relieve him from duty and order him to Cincinnati to report to me by letter, and place Sheridan in command of his corps.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Your report received. Move up and attack Wheeler's cavalry vigorously as agreed on. If you cannot cross the river then join Sturgis and operate with him. HE being senior will, of course, command while operating together.

Communicate with him frequently across the river if you succeed in moving up on the east side.
