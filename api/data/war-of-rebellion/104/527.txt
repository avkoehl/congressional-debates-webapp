Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

I have just met Colonel Merrill returning from Calhoun, where he met General Wofford, who gave Colonel Woodall-intrusted with your dispatch to General Wilson-an escort and railroad transportation from Atlanta to Macon, where General Wilson now is. The Confederate forces under Cobb and Smith are surrendered to General Wilson, who holds Macon with Cobb and Smith as prisoners. General Wofford is willing to surrender himself and staff and all the force he can but is apprehensive if he surrender most of his force will scatter to the hills.

Do not move on Wofford until General Thomas hears from Washington, which will probably be to-morrow. Concentrate your force at Resaca, and be prepared to move, however,
