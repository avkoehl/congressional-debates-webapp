HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, March 16, 1865.

Commodore PALMER,

Commanding West Gulf Squadron:

There is said to be a naval bandit operating about the Amite and Tickfaw Rivers capturing vessels sent there. Although the country is very much overflowed, I propose to send some cavalry to the Amite River, and if it is possible I think it would be a good thing if a gunboat could be sent up there at the same time, in order to scour the lower part of the river, where our men cannot penetrate without boats. The passage of a gun- boat up that river and back would, besides, have a god effect. But of the propriety of it, of course, You must be the judge.

Very respectfully and truly,

T. W. SHERMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, La., March 16, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel PARKHURST,

Commanding Detachment Third Rhode Island Cavalry,

Hermitage Plantation, opposite Donaldsonville, La.:

Brigadier-General Sherman directs that You scour Amite River with all possible dispatch and capture, if possible, the guerrillas and jayhawkers infesting the country on that river. You will report at what time Your force will be on the Amite, as it is hoped the navy may be induced to push a boat up there. Acknowledge receipt.

Brigadier G en. C. BUSSEY:

GENERAL: Your letters of 8th and 9th instant are received. The methods adopted for the protection and temporary subsistence of the inhabitants are approved. The additional force asked for could doubtless be well used, but it is not possible now to furnish it, nor can I encourage You to hope for such re- enforcements in future. Curtail, if necessary, the extent of Your defensive line as directed in circular from headquarters Military Division West Mississippi, dated February 22, 1865.

Respectfully, yours.
