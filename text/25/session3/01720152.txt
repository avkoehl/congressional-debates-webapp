The House accordingly went into Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
Banks in the chan,) and, on motion of Mi CAM-
BRELENG, resumed the consideration of the
annual Army bill
The question pending was the amendment of
Mr Mason, of Virginia, to increase the proposed
appropriation for the national armories from
$300,000 to $360,000, (the amount m former
years )
Mr JOHNSON, of Maryland, supported the
amendment, and said he should consider the pro-
posed reduction as a virtual abandonment of the
system He went on to show the large amounts
of arms which had been manufactured in England
and France within a short period of time, referred
to the embauassed condition of the United States
during the war for the want of a pioper supply
of arms, and contended that it was net much
better offat the piesenttime, that there was much
difficulty m the State which hem partiepiesented
to supply its volunteer companies, and had no
doubt such was the case in other States He
thought if a reduction in the expendituies wasi
necessary, it should begin with those who were
the begt able to beai it—the superintendents, pay-
masters, and other officers of the Government, and
not by cutting off the means which keeji in em-
ployment tne poor mechanics He appealed to
the chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means to consent to the amendment of the gen-
tleman from Virginia, [Mr  Masom ]
Mr MURRAY warned the friends of the Ad-
ministration against the renewal of the cry of ex-
travagance which the Opposition, have charged
against it Let them beware that they do not
furnish the Opposition with weapons to carry on
their war to overthrow it He was not opposed
to judicious appropriations, and tiusted that his
party would not be, but thought that the amount
proposed by the Committee of Ways and Means
was amply sufficient to carry on this branch of
the public service, if due regard be had to econo-
my Mr M then went into a review of the more
pi eminent measures of General Jackson's admin-
istration, and dwelt at some length on the Indian
policy, replying to the lemaiks of Mr Everett,
some days ago, on the mode of executing the
Cherokee treaty, and giving a history of the Sem-
inole question, exoneiatmg the Admmistiation
from all censuie in that matter, but demonstrating
that the whole had giown out of the perfidy and
sanguinaiy spirit of those Indians Nor were our
reverses in Florida to be laid to the charge of
the Administration, foi the most skillful geneials,
and troops equal to any living, were sent there,
but they had an unhealthy and deadly climate
to contend with, boundless and trackless forests
and swamps to wade thiough, were often with-
out food and clothing, and yet, aftei endunngall
these hardships and pinations, they had met with
hule in retuin but abuse, while the Indian and
his sti uggles had been lauded to the skies, and all
were brought foi ward as so many aiguments
against the Admmistiation Mr M then went
into an examination of the pension system, the
expenditures of the Government, &c , and dwelt
on these and various other topics at considerable
length a full report of which will be given here-
aftei
On motion of Mi CALHOON, of Kentucky,
the committee lose and reported piogress.
