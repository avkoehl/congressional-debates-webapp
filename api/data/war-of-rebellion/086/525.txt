SAINT LOUIS, November 11, 1864-11.15 p. m.

Colonel PHILIPS,

Warrensburg, Mo.:

In reference to the telegram sent you this evening, the following, just received, is given you for your information and guidance: Thirty or forty guerrillas crossing the river in skiffs to-day at or near Sibley, going south. At Camden another party crossed south. Large bodies of guerrillas reported in vicinity of Wellington. Make strong efforts to destroy them or drive them out. Major Bond's instructions to send scouts south seem unnecessary.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
