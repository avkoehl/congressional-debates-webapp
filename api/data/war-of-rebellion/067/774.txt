HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,May 6, 1864-12 m.

Captain McCLELLAN:

I was attacked by Fitz. Lee's division near the intersection of the Furnace and Brock roads. After an obstinate fight i drove him in disorder from the field, compelling him to leave a considerable number of dead and wounded on the field. My loss will be about 20 in all. General Rosser's assistant adjutant-general was killed. I have prisoners from Young's and Rosser's brigades. Colonel Devin, with his command, arrived in the nick of time and rendered good service. Gregg also let me have two guns. The enemy retired to my left, and are now in front of Gregg.

G. A. CUSTER,

Commanding Brigade.

HEADQUARTERS,Junction of Furnace and Brock Roads May 7, 1864-12 m.

GENERAL: General custer has had a sharp fight on the left, toward Todd's Tavern, and rove the enemy handsomely. The general's position is close to this, a little in advance of that of yesterday at same hour. Heaton's battery in same place. General custer is anxious to know where General Gregg is. The firing has almost ceased for the present. All has gone well. The cavalry he engaged was Fitzhugh Lee's. There was a portion of a Southern (rebel) battery (probably two guns) in position at this side of Todd's Tavern. Communication is reported open with the infantry left.
