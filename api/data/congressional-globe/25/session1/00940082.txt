There would have been no necessity whatever for
an extraordinary election to ha\e taken place, had
not the President deemed it proper to issue his
proclamation convening Congress on the first
Monday in September The Governor, seeing
that the State of J9i;>sissippi w ould not be repre-
sented ir the extra session of Congress, m virtue of
the power he conceived conferred upon him, au-
thor zed an election to be held at an early day
The election was held m tae month of Jul j, but the
Goverror, in issuing his proclamation and wi its of
election, limited the per od for which these gentle-
men were to be elected to the first Monday in No-
vember, and this question would come up as to
how far he was authorized to do so The Gover-
nor had claimed this authority under that clause of
the Constitution of the United States which had
been referred to by *be gentleman fiom Tennes-
see, winch was, that " when vacancies happen in
the representation of any State, the Executive shall
issue writ-, of election to fill such vacancies " Mr
P contended that this was the plain and simple
Construction of the Constitution, and that it must
he so construed We must take the plain and sim-
ple meaning of w ords, and not place forced con-
strue tions upon them In the -very nature of
things, ill language must be defective, fheie-
fore wemu't endeavor to asceitam what was meant
by those who made use of thia language It seem-
ed to him, frc m the state of the lacts given, and
the literal meaning of words, that it uas self evi-
dent that such a vacancy had happened m this case
a.s was contemplated by the Constitution The
office of represe ntative was created by the Consti-
tution of the Unite 1 States, and w as as much an
office and as much one created by the Constitution,
as the ofice of Judge of the Supreme Court, Pre-
sident or Vice-Piesident oí the United States, or
any other oilite created under the Constitution The
tenu e oí that office was two years, and it expired
on the thud day oí March, and consequently the
oiiiee bc-dine vacant on the iouith day ol March,
and remained so until it was filled
Mi P then *ent into an examination of the
Word "happen," and conteneled that the gentle-
man had placed altogether too nartow a constru -
tion 01 the word He came io the conclusion thatthe
language was sufficiently broad to comprehend tins
case, and authorize the Executive of Mississippi to
issue his writs of electi n, duecting an election to
he h llin Tuly last It was necessaiv, fiom the
very nituit ot the ease, tint this power should be
everciscd by the Executive to have the inteiests of
the State represented at the present session We
must place a practical construction upon the Con-
stitution, an J m don^ so it would be fount thit
the sime reason e\ sted fai iss nng his win direct-
um at el r tion to b  held, as in the case ol e'eath

The House then proceeded to consider the " bill
to postpone the fc-uith instalment oí deposite with
the States," reported last night, without amendment
from the Committee of the Whole                         '

demned the pioviso introduced m the bill by ""«
Senate
Mr MENIFEE follo-ved on the same side, on
the ground that the deposite act, m its character,
partook ot the solemn and inviolable obligation of
a treaty, oí far moie binding force than even a
positive contract, and the passage of this bill was
not justified on financial grounds
Mr FRY said it was well known to the House
that it was veiy seldom he troubled the House
with any remarks He gencrallj contented himself
with giving a silcat vote upaJh every question pre-
sented to him But, sir, so many gentlemen seem
disposed to induce the belief that this bill of June,
1836, was conceived un a spirit of distribution, that
1 feel called upon to say that I know better Sn, I
w as a member of the Congress that conceived and
brought to peifection this deposite bill, and, sir, I
appeal to every gentleman who acted with me at
tne time to say whether it was not, in eterj se- se
of the word, clearly a deposite bill, a bill, the ob-
ject of which was to secuie the public moneys, to
give safetv to the funds, of the Gvemment, and an
enlargement of the system oí deposite commensu-
rate with the immense augmentat on of its funds
To show that it was considered a distribution act,
the gentleman from Kentucky, who just addressed
the Hi -ise, has cited the speeches of two gentlemen
from New York, and one fiom Pennsylvania It
is well Known that each of the--egentlemen was
opposed to the passage of that bill, and they took
the ground with a view of defeating the measure
Su, let me turn the attention of the gentleman
from Kentucky to a speech which was dehveied
while the bill w as under consideiation by the elistin-
guished gentleman of Virginia, (Mr Mercer,) who
addressed the House y esterdav "Mr Mercer was
astonished that gentleman should consider the tw o
proposition  distinct He would not vote for the on<
unless united with the other—it was a proposition
to reduce the amount of deposites in the banks,
fiom thirty-eight million-, to five millions—it was
an important part oí the subjeet legulating the de-
posites, and mdissoiubly connected with it—it
made the States responsible for the repayment of
the mone\, and ought not to be tailed a distribu-
tion " Here are the remaiks of a gentleman who
pai ticipatcel m the debate at tne time, who kn w
well the spirit and meaning of the act Sir, whai
is a distribution"! A distribution must have an ob-
ject m view If this money wa? distributed among
the St?tes, for what purposes was it distributed"*
Was it a domt on to ihe States'! If it wps, whv the
nccessitj lor an) piousion lor ts repayment Was
it a loan to the States'! If we turn to the pro-
ceedings of the Senate upon that bill, you
will find that upon a motion to strike out the
words "deposite with the States," and insert
" loan to the States," there weit but fhe out of
foity-five votesm its favoi It then clearly was not
a loan, nor a donation, and not a distribution in
the sense which it is endeavored to be sustained
heie Sir, I know the act was a deposite act, and
I know it was not until the bill, when it came
i into this House, was stripped of every feature
| that would chaiaclense it as any thing else than a
depos te bi 1, that those who eventually supported
it could be united m its suppoit
&n, suppose Congiess had at that time passed a
bill to deposite thnty-scveii millions of the money
m the Tieasurj w ith the Bank of the United
Sta'es, and suppose a fourth instalment was claim-
ed by that bank, miller the same c rcumstanccs, as
gentlemen now claim for the Slates Does any
gentleman think tne bank could claim1 Or suppose
the Secietaiy of the Tieasury m counting up the
balance in the Treasury, on the 1st of Januaiy last,
had made a mistake oi ten millioi s, and that, con-
sequent!} , three instalments w ould haveabsorbed the
whole Ireasuq, should Congress boirow money
meiely to make that deposite juth the States' It
cannot senouslv be thought of Sir, it was a de-
posite bill, the States have nothing to claim, they
entered into no contract about tn= mo ley, they had
merely to s?v whether they weie willing to become
the depositories of a part of the Government innds
oi not If the appropnations made by law sine 
the passage of that bill had. much ovei-reached the
income of the Government, and to  meet those
appropriations, ths Secietary had withheld one or
two instalments, without any legislation on our
pait, he would have been justified before the
country No man can or will deny it Then how idle
to contend that the Secretary of the Treasury shall
make this fourth instalment with the States, and
let the General Government boirow die monev and
tax the people, so mat the instalment can be made
Sir, the people would not justify this House, if
we should bonow money with a view to gi/e
it to the States S r, a distinguished col-
league of mine, (Mr Bdlle) I understood a
j f°w days ago to sav, that he could not return to
I his constituents, and say tiiathe had rcl nqu shed
| Pennsylvania's share of this moncj Sn, I am as
willing, and I ha\e always contributed what I
could to my natue State, and under proper cir-
cumstances that is, if this money was here and
not wanted, I should be the last man to w ithhold
any thmg from that State But, sir, the people of
Pennsylvania are too high-minded to beg from the
Genera1 Government Sn, tne people of Pennsyl-
vania, besides I1 eir industry "nd ecoiomj,hate
abundant resources without depending upon help
from the General Government, especially when the
Gene-al Government wants all it has for its o\\ n
use
I beg to differ fiom rr) colleague in one pirticu-
lai I understood him to say, that it was to'he
firmness and sagacdj of the present Executiv e of
Pennsy Ivama, that that State was in a condition
not to require th s fouith instalment Sir, I have
no fault to find with the veto message upon the
Improvement bill parsed at the last sc sion of the
Legislature of Pennsylvania But, sir, whether
the policy of that message is to be attributable to
the foresight and sagacity of the present incumbent,
is what I doubt That veto menage, written m
Philadelphia, as was gencially supposed, was trans-
mitted to Harrisburg, vetoing the whole bill, as it
w ■•  expected it would pass Uafo'tu lately, how-
ever, before the message reached its des ¡nation
two oi three material items of appropuation were
struck out of the bill just before its final passpge
Oui worthy Gov ernor, however signed the mes-
sage, and sent it to the Legislatuie, vetom" the
whole bill, including the items that hadbeen struck
out I do not recur to thu epoch in the history oí
Pennsylvania política with a view to deiogate fiom
the character of the Executive of Pennsylvania
nay, I respect him as the Governor of that gieat
and giow mg Commonwealth, and he has fuends
here fer whom I chensh the kindest feelings, and
who I am proud to own as Pennsyhamans, but I
íecur to the fact to show that it was not so much
to be altributsd to the sagacity ot the Execut v e of
Pennsylvania, as my colleague was wont to sho v,
that that State w as m a condition to do w i*hout
this fourth instalment
Su, it was stated heie on yesterday by a gentle-
man from Massachu etts, [Mr Cushmg ] that the
amendment which was mtioduced into the depo-
site bill by a then colleague of mine [Gen Antho-
ny,] was written in, or came fiom, one of the
departments, and that my colleague acted a, the
insUument of one of the Executne officers m
submitting it, and said he could prove it Sir, I
know not where that amendment came fiom, I
know Gen Anthony presented it, and ltwrslhe
only couise that we could at that time unite upon
If the gentleman was m his seat, I would suggest
to him that it probably would be better to j is' ty
that charge, with the proof which he has at hand
S r, I am opposed to making this deposite of
this fourth instalment, because I am opposed to the
measure of issuing Treasury drafts I -«l^h the
Go; ernment to get along without a resort to a-
increase of paper circulation of any kind at this
time. Sir, the hanks, since the suspension of spe-
cie payments, have been gradually reducing their
'hseounts, so that their condit on, at this time, is
infinitely improved to what it was when the sus-
pension took place If now the Government issue
twelve m 11 ons of Tieasury notes, they necessarily
will find their way into the banks—the bank 
will discount upon them to at least double
their amount, and when the time amves for
then redemption, jcu will find that by this act
we   have   added twenty-five   or thirlv   millions
