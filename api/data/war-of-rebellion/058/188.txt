about 2 miles in front of your line up the valley. Our cavalry force is so small, and the animals in so bad condition, that it is impossible to make this cavalry picket strong enough to make any determined resistance. The most that is expected from it is to give timely notice of any force of the enemy approaching from that direction.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. PERKINS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant-Colonel PHILLIPS,

Athens:

Dr. McVey says a force from Bainbridge passed up the Waterville road on Wednesday night. They went 15 miles and were still going on. How many men do you want to go down and clean out this band of rebels, and how many can you take from your command?

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

BRIDGEPORT, January 23, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE:

Refugees from near Gadsden, Ala., report to Colonel Grose, at Whiteside's, that there are two regiments of rebel cavalry and a battery of six pieces at that place. One of the women came on steamboat from Roma to Gadsden week ago Wednesday; was but one steamer running there. They saw other cavalry going out of Georgia, it was said, to recruit their horses. Captain Davenport, with one company, is at Portersville, in Will's Valley. Refugees left Gadsden last Saturday.
