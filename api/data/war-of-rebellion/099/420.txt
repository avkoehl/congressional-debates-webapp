Major MAX. WOODHULL, Asst. Adjt. General, Fifteenth Army Corps:

MAJOR: I respectfully report that, in obedience to your orders, I broke camp at 7 this a. m., and marched in the direction of Sandy Run Post-Office. Striking the main State road at that point I proceeded some three miles and a half farther, going into camp near Wolf's plantation. On reaching the creek at this place I discovered a small party of the enemy on the opposite side. They, however, retreated at once befroe my skirmishers. My position is good, being on a high ridge just beyond the creek, two brigades on the right and one on the left of the road, with the battery directly in the road. The troops are intrenched, with good works. To-night the rebel cavalry made a dash on my picket-line capturing three of the vedettes. My headquarters are on the south side of the creek near the bridge.

I am, major, very respectfully,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General
