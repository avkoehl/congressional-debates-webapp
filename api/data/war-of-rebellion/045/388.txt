CAPTAIN: The major-general commanding directs that you have sufficient combustible materials taken over to the west end of the public bridge, and there placed, under the direction of General Smith, in such places that the bridge, if necessary, can be fired at a moment's notice. Combustible materials of any kind can be used. Turpentine, tar, shavings, &amp;c., would be the best. Without delay.

ALTOONA, June 28, 1863.

Major-General COUCH:

I have been out examining the country. I find three or four gaps, from 15 to 20 miles out, that should be guarded, in order to protect this place. I can guard them with 1, 200 or 1, 500 men and four or six pieces of artillery. I leave here with five companies at 12 o'clock to-day for McKee's Gap, and if I had a mustering officer at this place I could raise the remaining number sufficient to guard the gaps. Can you send me four or six pieces, or can I get them from Pittsburgh? We have the men for them. It is necessary that I should have them.

N. L. YARNALL,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
