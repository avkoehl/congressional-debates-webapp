THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Dec. 2,
the head of improvements and repairs in navy-
yards, buildings, and machinery.
I deem it of much importance to a just economy,
and a correct understanding'of naval expenditures,
that there should be an entire separation of the ap-
propriations for the support of the naval service
proper from those for permanent improvements
at navy-yard sand stations, and from ocean steam-
mail service, and other special objects assigned to
the supervision of this Department.
The report of the Postmaster General, herewith
communicated, presents an interesting view of the
progress, operations, and condition of his Depart-
ment.
At the close of the last fiscal year, the length of
mail routes within the United States was 196,290
miles; the annual transportation thereon 53,272,252
miles; and the annual cost of such transportation
J3,421,754.
The length of the foreign- mail routes is estima-
ted at 18,349 miles, and the annual transportation
therein at 615,206 miles. The annual cost of this
service is $1,472,187, of which $448,937 is paid
by the Post Office Department, and ยง1,023,250 is
paid through the Navy Department.
The annual transportation within the United
States (excluding the service in California and
Oregon, which is now, for the first time, reported
and embraced in the tabular statements of the De-
partment) exceeds that of the preceding year
6,162,855 miles, at an increased cost of $547,110.
The'whole number of post offices in the United
States on the 30th day of June last was 19,796.
There were 1,698 post offices established, and 256
discontinued during the year.
The gross revenues of the Department for the
fiscal year, including the appropriations for the
franked matter of Congress, of the Departments,
and officers of Government, and excluding the for-
eign postages, collected for, and payable to, the
British post office, amounted to $6,727,866 78.
The expenditures for the same period (excluding
$20,599 49, paid under an award of the Auditor,
m pursuance of a resolution of the last Congress,
for mail service on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers
in 1832 and 1833, and the amount paid to the Brit-
ish post office for foreign postages collected for and
payable to that office) amounted to $6,024,566 79;
leaving a balance of revenue over the proper ex-
โข penditures of the year of $703,299 99.
The receipts for postages during I he year (ex-
cluding the foreign postages collected for and pay-
able to the British post office) amounted to
$6,345,747 21, being an increase of ยง997,610 79,
or 18.65-100 per cent, over the like receipts for the
preceding year.
The reduction of postage, under theact of March
last, did not take effect until the commencement of
the present fiscal year. The accounts for the first
quarter, under the operation of the reduced rates,
will not be settled before January next; and no
reliable estimate of the receipts for the present year
can yet be made. It is believed, however, that
they will fall far short of those of the last year.
The surplus of the revenues now on hand is, how-
ever, so large that no further appropriation from
the Treasury in aid of the revenues of the Depart-
ment is required for the current fiscal year; but an
additional appropriation for the year ending June
30, 1853, will probably be found necessary when
the receipts of the first two quarters of the fiscal
year are fully asceitained.
In his last annual report the Postmaster General
recommended a reduction of postage to rates which
he deemed as low as could be prudently adopted,
unless Congress was prepared to appropriate from
the Treasury, for the support of the Department,
a sum more than equivalent to the mail services
performed by it for the Government. The recom-
mendations of the Postmaster General, in respect
to letter postage, except on letters from and to
California and Oregon, were substantially adopted
by the last Congress. He now recommends ad-
herence to the present letter rates, and advises
against a further reduction until justified by the
revenue of the Department.
He also recommends that the rates of postage
on printed matter be so revised as to render them
more simple, and more uniform in their operation
upon all classes of printed matter. I submit the
recommendations of the report to your favorable
consideration.
The public statutes of the United States have
now been accumulatingfor mare than sixty years,
and, interspersed with private acts, are scattered
through numerous volumes; and, from the cost of
the whole, have become almost inaccessible to the
great mass of the community . They also exhibit
much of the incongruity and imperfection of hasty
legislation. As it seems to be generally conceded
that there is no "common law" of the United
States to supply the defects of their legislation, it
is most important that that legislation should be
as perfect as possible, defining every power in-
tended to be conferred, every crime intended to be
made punishable, and prescribing the punishment
to be inflicted. In addition to some particular
cases spoken of more at length , the whole criminal
code is now lamentably defective. Some offences
are imperfectly described, and others are entirely
omitted; so that flagrant crimes may be committed
with impunity. The scale of punishment is not
in all cases graduated according to the degree and
nature of the offence, and is often rendered more
unequal by the different modes of imprison-
ment, or penitentiary confinement, in the different
States.
Many laws of a permanent character have been
introduced into appropriation bills, and it is often
difficult to determine whether the particular clause
expires with the temporary act of which it is a
part, or continues in force. It has also frequently
happened that enactments and provisions of law
have been introduced into bills, with the title or
general subject of which they have little or no
connection or relation. In this mode of legisla-
tion so many enactments have been heaped upon
each other, and often with but little consideration,
that, in many instances, it is difficult to search out
and determine what is the law.
The Government of the United States is em-
phatically a government of written laws. The
statutes should, therefore, as far as practicable,
not only be made accessible to all, but be expressed
in language so plain and simple as to be under-
stood by all, and arranged in such method as to
give perspicuity to every subject. Many of the
States have revised their public acts with great and
manifest benefit; and I recommend that provision
be made by law for the appointment of a commis-
sion to revise the public statutes of the United
States, arranging them in order, supplying deficien-
cies, correcting incongruities, simplifying their
' language, and reporting them to Congress for its
j action.
j An act of Congress, approved 30th September,
1850, contained a provision for the extension of
the Capitol, according to such plan as might be
| approved by the President, and appropriated one
; hundred thousand dollars to be expended under
| his direction, by such architect as he should ap-
! point to execute the same. On examining the
! various plans which had been submitted by dif-
j ferent architects, in pursuance of an advertisement
I by a committee of the Senate, no one was found
I to be "entirely satisfactory, and it was therefore
I deemed advisable to combine and adopt the advan-
; tages of several.
| The great object to be a-complished was to make
such an addition as would afford ample and con-
venient halls for the deliberations of the two
Houses of Congress, with sufficient accommoda-
tions for spectators, and suitable apartments for
the committees and officers of the two branches of
the Legislature. It was also desirable not to mar
the harmony and beauty of the present structure,
which, as a specimen of architecture, is so univer-
sally admired. Keeping these objects in view, I
concluded to make the addition by wings,detached
j from the present building, yet connected with it by
corridors. This mode of enlargement will leave
the present Capitol uninjured, and afford great ad-
vantages for ventilation and the admission of light,
and will enable the work to progress without inter-
rupting the deliberations of Congress. To carry
this plan into effect, I have appointed an experi-
enced and competent architect. The corner-stone
was laid oil the 4th day of July last, with suitable
ceremonies, since which tune ihe work has ad-
vanced with commendable rapidity, and the foun-
dations of both wings are now nearly complete.
I again commend to your favorable regard the
interests of the District of Columbia, and deem it
only necessary to remind you that although its
inhabitants have no voice in the choice of Repre-
sentatives in Congress, they are not the less enti-
tled to a just and liberal consideration in your
legislation. My opinions on this subject were
more fully expressed in my last annual communi-
cation.
Other subjects were brought to the attention of
Congress in my last annual message', to which X
would respectfully refer. But there was one of
more than ordinary interest, to which I again invite
your special attention. I allude to the recommen-
dation for the appointment of a commission to set-
tle private claims against the United States. Jus-
tice to individuals, as well as to the Government,
imperatively demands that some more convenient
and expeditious mode than an appeal to Congress
should be adopted.
It is deeply to be regretted that in several in-
stances officers of the Government, in attempting
to execute the law for the return of fugitives from
labor, have been openly resisted, and their efforts
frustrated and defeated by lawless and violent
mobs; that in one case such resistance resulted in
the death of an estimable citizen, and in others se-
rious injury ensued to those officers and so indi-
viduals who were using their endeavors to sustain
the laws. Prosecutions have been instituted against
the alleged offenders, so far as they could be iden-
tified, and are still pending. 1 have regarded it as
my duty, in these cases, to give all aid legally in
my power to the enforcement of the laws, and I
shall continue to do so wherever and whenever
their execution may be resisted.
The act of Congress for the return of fugitives
from labor is one required and demanded by the
express words of the Constitution.
The Constitution declares, "That no person
'held to service or labor in one State, under the
' laws thereof, escaping into another, shall, in con-
' sequence of any law or regulation therein, be dis-
' charged from such service or labor, but shall be
' delivered up on claim of the party to whom such
' service or labor may be due." This constitutional
provision is equally obligatory upon the Legisla-
tive, the Executive, and Judicial Departments of
the Government, and upon every citizen of the
United States.
Congress, however, must, from necessity, first
act upon the subject, by prescribing the proceed-
ings necessary to ascertain that the person is a
fugitive, and the means to be used for his restora-
tion to the claimant. This was done by an act
passed during the first term of President Wash-
ington, which was amended by that enacted by
the last Congress, and it now remains for the
Executive and Judicial Departments to take care
I that these laws be faithfully executed. This in-
. junction of the Constitution is as peremptory and
| as binding as any other; it stands exactly on the
t same foundation as that clause which provides for
| the return of fugitives from justice, or that which
; declares that no bill of attainder or ex post facto law
I shall be passed, or that which provides for all
j equality of taxation according to the census, or
the clause declaring tbatall duties shall be uniform
throughout the United States, or the important
j provision that the trial of all crimes shall be by
] jury. These several articles and clauses of the
\ Constitution, all resting on the same authority,
; must stand or fall together. Some objections have
been urged against the details of the act for the
return of fugitives from labor; but it is worthy of
remark that the main opposition is aimed against
the Constitution itself, and proceeds from persons
and classes of persons, many of whom declare
their wish to see that Constitution overturned.
They avow their hostility to any law which shall
give full and practical effect to this requirement of
; the Constitution. Fortunately, the number of
j these persons is comparatively small, and is be-
! lieved to be daily diminishing, but the issue which
J they present is one which involves the supremacy
1 and even the existence of the Constitution.
Cases have heretofore arisen in which individ-
uals have denied the binding authority of acts of
Congress, and even States have proposed to nullify
such acts, upon the ground that the Constitution
was the supreme law of the land, and that those,
acts of Congress were repugnant to that instrument;
but nullification is now aimed, not so much against
particular laws as being inconsistent with the Con-
stitution, as against the Constitution itself; and it
is not' to be disguised that a spirit exists and has
been actively at work to rend asunder this Union,
which is our cherished inheritance from our rev-
olutionary fathers.
In my last annual message I stated that I con-
sidered the series of measures, which had been
