Brigadier General J. J. PETTIGREW,

Commanding, &amp;c., Hanover Junction:

GENERAL: General Pickett informs me, on what he deems reliable authority, that a regiment of infantry, one battery of artillery, and 200 cavalry of the enemy are at West Point, the confluence of the Pamunkey and Mattapony Rivers. He thinks it possible that they may ascend the north bank of the Pamunkey and attempt to reach Hanover Junction. I give you this notice that you may be on your guard.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE CAPE FEAR,Wilmington, May 11, 1863.

H. P. WALKER,

H. M. Actg. Consul for the States of N. C. and S. C. at Charleston:

SIR: I have received your letter of this date relating to the schooner Harkaway, alleged to belong to a British subject engaged in running the blockade, and seized in this port by the military authorities of the Confederate States of America.

I am not aware that my Government has recognized you as the representative of Her Britannic Majesty. Her Britannic Majesty's Government has certainly not recognized the Government of the Confederate States. I decline, therefore, to discuss the subject with you or to release the vessel, but will forward your communication to the Secretary of State and await orders.

In the mean time, as Her Britannic Majesty's Government does not recognize the jurisdiction of the Confederate States here, and the United States Government claims it, perhaps it would be as well to apply to the latter.

Very respectfully,

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.
