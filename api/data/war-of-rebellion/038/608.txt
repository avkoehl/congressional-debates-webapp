Vicksburg, January 28, 1863.

Major THEO. Johnston,

Commissary of Subsistence, Jackson:

The lieutenant-general commanding directs me to buy cattle and hogs. I wish to start an agent up Deer Creek to buy corn immediately; also want him to buy meat. Send me all the money you have, and get as much as possible from Dameron.

T. B. REED,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.

Colonel J. R. WADDY:

The command is waiting. Without sufficient transportation; moving very slowly for want of it.

W. W. LORING.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF Mississippi AND EASTERN LOUISIANA, Vicksburg, January 28, 1863.

His Excellency Gov. Thomas O. MOORE, Opelousas, La.:

SIR: I have written to Captain [Beverly] Kennon, of the steamer Webb, requesting his co-operation in preventing the canal across the neck opposite Vicksburg. It is essential that this be done, because it not only endangers the two main points on the river, but the interior of Louisiana. With the Webb and Captain Kennon, together with the co-operation of our land batteries, the mouth of the canal on this side can be held. Feeling assured that Your Excellency will think with me, and that you will be willing to do anything in your power to assist me, I have requested Captain Kennon to proceed to this point with all possible dispatch.

I am, sir, very respectfully, &amp;c.,J. C. PEMBERTON.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF Mississippi AND EASTERN LOUISIANA, Jackson, January 28, 1863.

Major L. MIMS:

Chief Quartermaster, or Officer acting as Chief Quartermaster:

I am directed by Lieutenant-General Pemberton to say to you that he wishes no more troops to go to Vicksburg until further orders.

I am, major, very respectfully,

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
