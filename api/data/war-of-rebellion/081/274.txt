HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 21, 1864-7.15 a. m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

You can move your corps, taking position on the left of the Fifth Corps, and extending as far to the left as practicable, enveloping and keeping as close as possible to the enemy's line. I hope you will be able to get possession of the Weldon railroad, though it is probable the enemy may attempt to cover and defend it. I will send the Sixth Corps to-night to take post on your left, and desire to stretch across to the Appomattox. Please report progress.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the headquarters of the Second Corps will be near the Avery house, in rear of General Warren's. Until telegraph is up dispatches to Fifth corps headquarters will reach me.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

General Warren has been directed to turn over to you the detachment of cavalry under command of Captain Crowninshield. The commending general directs that you push out this cavalry to the left and ascertain where and how the enemy is posted.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,June 21, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

In coming I passed part of train of Gibbon's division and Artillery Brigade, Second Corps, marching parallel in rear of these headquarters to the left. General Birney's operators are here, ready to push out wire as soon as Birney's headquarters are known. It would waste too much wire, and perhaps, time now to extend it.

T. LYMAN.
