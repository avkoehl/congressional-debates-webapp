The CHAIRMAN. By order of the House
all general debate upon this bill has now term-
inated.
Mr. WOOD. Inasmuch as the gentleman
from Illinois [Mr. Washburne] has made some
remarks which we on this side of the House
think should receive some notice and reply, I
ask unanimous consent to have the time for
general debate extended for ten minutes.
The CHAIRMAN. That cannot be done in
Committee of the Whole, as it was the order of
the House that all general debate upon this
bill shall terminate in half an hour.
Mr. WOOD. The gentleman from Illinois
[Mr. Washbhrne] has spoken more than half
an hour.
The CHAIRMAN. But a minute or two,
only enough to enable him to conclude a para-
graph. The gentleman from New York [Mr.
Wool)] can obtain the opportunity he desires
by moving an amendment, as the bill is now
open to amendment.
Mr. WOOD. Then I move to amend this
bill by striking out the first paragraph, for the
purpose of making a few remarks.
This House always listens with a great deal
of interest, if not with pleasure, to the remarks
of the distinguished gentleman from Illinois.
But whatever interest has heretofore attached
to anything emanating from that quarter has
an additional importance at this time, in view
of the supposed connection between that gen-
tleman and the incoming Administration. We
suppose that the labored and prepared speech
which he has just delivered upon the condition
of the country, and the necessity for the intro-
duction of great reforms, especially in legisla-
tion as well as in administration, more partie-
ularly with reference to some details which the
gentleman has reported to this committee, we
suppose that we are justified in regarding his
speech as a sort of introductory message, lay-
ing the foundation for the policy of the next
Administration. In that view, which I think
we are warranted in taking, anything emanat-
ing from that gentleman is entitled to a great
deal of consideration by this House and by the
country.
The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Wash-
burxe] has siated that the administration of
General Grant has been created by the peo-
ple—if I quote him correctly, and I speak only
from memory—not only in consequence of
the eminent services that General Grant has
rendered the country, but also for the purpose
of carrying out great reforms in the public
affairs of the country. Now, sir, I am sure
that I speak the sentiment of the minority upon
this side of the House when I say that so far
as the administration of General Grant shall
in good faith either initiate or carry out any
reform we will heartily respond to it, and we
will give that administration, to that extent,
our support in the Forty-First Congress.
The country wants reform; not reform in
speeches merely, not reform in promises alone,
but substantial reform, not only by a curtail-
ment of the expenses of the Government, but
by the adoption of measures which will restore
harmony and promote the general pacification
of "the country. Sir, we want something more
than mere professions. The gentleman from
Illinois [Mr. Washburne] himself made a
speech here yesterday against a measure re-
ported by a distinguished gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, [Mr.kelley,] and subsequently voted
for the measure. I trust that is not the spirit
which is to actuate the gentleman with refer-
ence to the next Administration. This House
and the country require something more than
mere profession.
The gentleman has also stated that Congress
has the power to bring about reforms, and that
it is the duty of the Executive to see that the
laws are faithfully executed. Now, that gen-
tleman and his friends have had full possession
of the legislative department of the Govern-
ment for the last eight years, yet what reform
has Congress attempted to initiate? The
minority herehave been feeble, powerless. We
could neither initiate nor carry through either
House of Congress any measures looking to
reform in the administration of the Govern-
ment. While the gentleman and his political
friends and the friends of the incoming ad-
ministration have controlled the legislation of
Congress, the abuses to which the gentleman
has referred have been not only initiated but
carried out in the form of acts of Congress.
Hence I have risen for the purpose of saying
that if the design is to have reform we on this
side of the House will sustain General Grant
in bringing back peace and harmony to the
nation, in restoring gold and silver as the con-
stitutional currency of the country, and in
inaugurating a general reform in every depart-
ment of the Government.
I withdraw my amendment.
The Clerk read as follows:
For invalid pensions under various acts, $10,000,000.
For pensions of widows, children, mothers, fathers,
brothers, and sisters of soldiers, as provided for by
acts of March 18,1818; May 15,1828; June 7,1832;
July 4, 1836; July 7, 1838; March 3,1843; June 17,
1814; February 2, July 21, and July 29,1848; Febru-
ary 3,1853; June 3,1858; and July 14,1862, with its
supplementary acts, and for compensation to pension
agents and expenses of agencies, $13,000,000.
Mr. MAYNARD. I move to amend the
paragraph last read by insertingafter the words
" supplementary acts " the words " and under
various special acts." As the bill now stands
there is no provision for the payment of pen-
sioners who have been placed on the pension-
roll in pursuance of private or special legis-
lation. I desire to call the attention of the
chairman of the Committee on Appropriations
to this matter.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The
amendment proposed by the gentleman from
Tennessee [Mr. Mayuard] is, I think, en-
tirely unnecessary, because there is a perma-
nent appropriation for paying the pensions
provided for by private acts. The bill is now
m the shape in which all these pension appro-
priation bills have been passed. It Covers
everything.
Mr. MAYNARD. I think the gentleman is
mistaken in that regard.
The CHAIRMAN. Does the gentleman
from Tennessee [Mr. Maynard] withdraw the
amendment?
Mr. MAYNARD. No, sir; I think it should
be adopted. Without it the pensioners under
special acts cannot, as I understand, be paid
under this bill, which I know is not the in-
tention of the committee or of the House.
The amendment was agreed to.
The Clerk resumed and concluded the read-
ing of the bill.
Mr. BROOKS. I desire to inquire why the
committee, in framing this bill, have not com-
plied with the rule which requires that the
amount of money appropriated shall be ap-
pended to the bill?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. The omis-
bion was ma.de inadvertently by the clerk of
the committee, and I called his attention to it
this morning. The bill, as tho gentleman will
observe, embraces only three items; one of
$10,000,000, one of $13,000,000, -and one of
$250,000, making an aggregate of $23,250,000.
Mr. BROOKS. I move that be appended
to the bill.
Mr. WASHBURNE,^ of Illinois. That is
not to be added to the bill as a part of the bill,
but is appended as a note.
Mr. BROOKS. Add it, then, as a note.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. It was
merely a clerical omission. There are notes to
all of the other appropriation bills.
Mr. BROOKS. In the consular and diplo-
matic bill the note not only states the total
amount of the appropriations, but also the
amount saved, while we have no note to this
bill at all.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I not only
complied with the rule to state the amount of
the appropriations, but, for the benefit of my
economical friend from New York, 1 also stated
the amount saved. I now move that the pen-
sion bill be laid aside, to be reported to the
House with the recommendation that it do
pass, and that the committee take up the con-
sular and diplomatic appropriation bill.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BROOKS. Of course all points of
order are reserved.
consular and diplomatic bill.
The CHAIRMAN. The Clerk will read
House bill No. 1570, making appropriations
for the consular and diplomatic expenses of
the Government for the year ending June BO,
1870, and for other purposes, the first time for
information.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. _ I move
that the first reading of the bill be dispensed
with.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Clerk
then proceeded to read the bill by paragraphs
for amendment, as follows :
For salaries of envoys extraordinary, ministers,
and commissioners of the United States at Great
Britain, France, Russia, Prussia, Spain, Austria,
Brazil, republic of Mexico, China. Italy, Chili, Peru,
Portugal, Switzerland, Greece, Belgium, Holland,
Denmark, Sweden,/Turkey, Ecuador, New Granada,
Bolivia, Venezuela, Guatemala, Kicaraguo, Sand-
wich Islands. Costa Rica, Honduras, Argentine Con-
federation, Par/guay, Uruguay, Japan, and Salva-
dor, $316,000. r
.r. BROOKS. This reduces tho estimate
froi!l^32af025 to $310,000, and I will ask the
gentleffl($ from Illinois to state where the
reduction takes place ?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I do not
understand the gentleman's question.
Mr. BROOKS. The estimates of the De-
partment call for $323,025, and the bill appro-
priates only $310,000, $7,000 less, and I ask
on what ground that reduction is made ?
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Rome,
which was estimated for, is left out.
Mr. BROOKS. Mr. Chairman, I move once
more, with a view ot arresting the attention of
the House, now free, 1 hope, from all religious
prejudice, that the mission to Rome be inserted
after "Salvador," and the usual appropriation
of $7,500 be made therefor. 1 trust now,
when the presidential election is over and pas-
sions, religious as well as political, are calmed
down, the House will, as heretofore, vote the
usual appropriation for the mission to Rome.
I jpressit upon the ground that the principality
of Rome is the headquarters of a large por-
