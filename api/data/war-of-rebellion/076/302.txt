HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Near Atlanta, ga., July 30, 1864.

Captain A. C. McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourteenth Corps:

CAPTAIN: Please say to General Palmer that Colonel Taylor, in charge of the picket-line has just come in, and reports the line strongly intrenched. He says there is an elegant place for a section of artillery at the point on the railroad at which my left rests. The embrasures of the rebel work are in full view. Guns placed there would have to be sunk or otherwise strongly protected. The men at work on the skirmish line were subjected to a pretty heavy fire from the rebel front, through not one single man killed or wounded.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General.
