The Iron and Steel Swindle—Mr. Marshall.
41st Oong 2d Sess.
cost of making pig iron in this country is found
in the letter of Colonel George T. Lewis, of
ClarksvHle, Tennessee, dated April 19, 1870,
addressed to Hon. J. A. Garfield, of this
House, and published April 21 in the Repub-
lican Banner of Nashville, Tennessee, which
I now hold in.my hand. Colonel Lewis is a
gentleman well and favorably known, long en-
gaged in the manufacture of iron, and whose
reliability has been indorsed by the Pottsville
Miners' "journal, the Washington Chronicle,
and other protection journals. After charac-
terizing Tennessee, Georgia, and Alabama as
the " Wales of America," he says:
" Herewith I submit an estimate of tho actual cost
of'one ton of pi#? metal, supposing the capacity of
the furoaco to be six thousand tons per annum,
located near tho. beds of ore, coal, and limestone,
arid to cost $100,000:
Mining, loading, and transportation of two tons
ore 00
Mining, loading, and transportation of eighty
bushels coal  G 40
Quarrying, loading, and transportation of one
thousand pounds limestone  50
Superintendence, labor, <fce., per ton1  <1 00
Wear and tear, per ton  «>0
Interest on invi-.slment, per ton  1 00

Thus making the cost of production, includ-
ihg proper allowances for wear and tear of
machinery, interest on investment, and inci-
dentals, but Slti 95 per ton. After making
a statement of the cost of producing iron at
Brazil. Indiana; iSteubenville,Ohio ; and Pitts-
burg, Pennsylvania, Colonel Lewis adds:
" Now, sir, I will give you tho cost of one ton of
pi? metal in Nashville:

ore  $0 00

" Bui Nashville is not the cheapest point to mako
pig metal. It eon ho mado on tho Nnshvilio and
GhtiUanoofM railroad, and delivered in Nashville at
a cost of #19 pei ton, which is $10 50 per ton less than
tho cost in Pittsburg."
And referring to a former letter, whose
ligiuvfi had hcon questioned by some of those
who are clamoring lor protection, he continues:
" J reaffirm, sir, everylhing stated in my Jotter to

iron, as insinuated by some. My views upon that
question, however, are those taught by Henry Clay,
'atariff for revenue, with incidental protection to
American manufactures;' but from the present as-
pect of affairs in that regard I fear the policy of
'protection5 will be broken down by its friends/'

"And these mines of woallhjin the Southwest are
not 'in some inaccessible regions in Alabama and
Georgia, whero the Almighty has placed coal, ore,
and limestone in close proximity/ where 'it is con-
ceded that pig iron can be produced cheaper than
in thebituminous coal region of thisState(Ohio)and
the anthracite district in Pennsylvania,' as stated in
a letter addressed to you, sir, by J.Gr, Butler, jr., e®q.,
of Youngatown, Ohio. They a bound in the valleys of
the Tennessee, Cumberland. Sequatchie, Coosa, Ala-
bama, Black Warrior, and Cahawba; from the Vir-
ginia line, through theStatoaof Tennessee, Georgia,
and Alabama, to Mississippi: 'inaccessible regions/
indeed I Why, sir. the East Tennessee and Virginia,
ICnoxvillo and Kentucky, Nashville and Chatta-
nooga, Winch ester and Alabama, Alabama and Chat-
tanooga, North and South, and other railroads, aro
almost walled in by iron ore, coal, and limestone,
which tho God ot nature has bestowed with a lavish
hand upon this favored country.
"And pig iron can now be made in Tennessee,
Georgia, and Alabama, and delivered at Louisville
at a cost of $2% Cincinnati $23. and Pittsburg, $2o
per ton. One ton of pig iron can bo freighted from a
furnace in either one of these States to Pittsburg, by
rail and river, at loss cost than one and a halt tons of
iron ore is freighted from Lake Superior, and a half
ton oi limestone from the interior. Lako navigation
is open only about fivomonths; tho Cumberland and
Ohio rivers aro navigablo seven months in a year."
This whole letter of Colonel Lewis is very
interesting, and well worth the attention of all
who desire to be properly informed on this
question. It is from an accomplished business
man, who is in theory a protectionist, and does
not write in the interest of free trade, i will
only detain the House with this interesting arti-
cle from the Chattanooga Times, which Colo-
nel Lewis embodies in his letter with evident
approval and indorsement, it has reference
chiefly to the production of charcoal iron, the
most valuable and expensive of all:
"In support of tho proposition that the Tennessee
river valley and tho country adjacent thereto must
become tho great seat of iron manufacture in this
country, wo havo published at various times state-
ments ol tho cost per ton of pig iron made from bitum-
inous coal, showing tho great advantages which
wo possoss ovor tho Pennsylvania iron region-*.
"Tho letter of Gcorgo T. Lewis, which we have
heretoforo published, makes tho cost at the furnace
of ono ton of pig metal mado with bituminous coal
at $IG 95, under the most favorable circumstances,
such, for instance, ns those possessed by tho Rock-
wood furnaco, in Itoano county, Tennessee. Mr.
Lowis gives no estimate of tho cost of making char-
coal iron, which, for certain purposes, cannot be
replaced by iron mado with bituminous e*al.
" Wo aro glad to bo able to sup (dement tho inform-
ation contained in Mr. Lewis's letter by an exact
statement of tho cost of making eh-weoal iron, taken
from tho books of Major L. L. Thoma-son. of Uus
eity, who has been in tiioiron buVnie.^s tweutyycar-.
The statement is taken from his books while super-
intendent of tho Cornwall Furnace, Cherokee county,
Georgia. Tho furnace, it should be stated, is a sin a!!
charcoal furnace, only thirty-four feet high, with
eight feet boshes cold blast.

"It will be seen from these figures, which are
based upon actual experiment, that during the three
weeks the furnacc made one hundred and sixty-lour
and a ctuarter tons of pig iron at a total cost, laid
down at the rolling-milHn Koine, of $-3,675 75, or an
average cost per ton of $22 S7. Deducting from the
total cost $449 75, paid for hauling and freight to
llomo, or $2 74 per ton, and we have the cost per ton
at tho hirnaeo only $19 63 lor No. 1 pig iron, which
brings per ton. The tariff on pig iron is now £9
in gold or $10 80 in currency, with gold at 120. If
Congress should abolish tho tariff, suppose that to
bo deducted from the price, leaves $34 80, which
would still give a profit at Rome of 6-12 43 per ton,
or a little o\*cr lifty-Hvo percent. With the tariff
tiie protit per ton is sometlnngover one hundred per
cent. Therefore, if tho t.u iff is abolished or reduced
so low that (ho Pennsylvania non-men find them-
selves unable to make both ends meet, wo hopo they
will be emboldened by these figures to pull up stakes
and come down here, whore naturo has been so
bountiful of her treasures that tho iron-makers
stand in no need of any other protection than their
own labor and the quality of their iron give them."
Mr. "Wells, in his reply to the attack made
upon him by the Committee on Manufactures,
furnishes overwhelming proof to xustaiu the
statements made by him in his report of De-
cember last. 1 will detain the House with but
a small portion of it. AbramS. Hewitt, esq.,
a commissioner on the part of the United States
to the department of metals of the late Paris
exhibition, and a most unquestioned authority
on the subject, in his official report, published
by the State Department, says:
" In the United States tho cheapest region for tho
manufhetw e of pig iron, extensively developed, is
in tho Lehigh valley in the State of Pennsylvania,
whero pig iron is produced at an avcrago cost of
twenty-four dollars per ton."
Senator YVakxeu, of Alabama, writes to the
Commissioner as follows:
Uxiti:d States Sen'vtr Cuambkh,
Washington*, May 2,1870.
Silt: Mr. West, superintendent of Shelby
11ou Works at Shelby. Columbiana county. Ala-
bama. told mo last summer that, he was sending iron
to Philadelphia for ton dollars per ton, freight. lie
also said he .vassondingirontoCincinnatiandLouis-
villn.
General Wilder, of Tennessee, told me to-day that
ho was shipping" iron from his furnaces nearChatta-
nooga to Indianapolis ; and that his iron cost from
eighteen to twenty-two dollars per ton; and that,
with ample capital, &c., it could bo mado at fifteen
dollars: but that time would bo required ro do this.
Yours, truly, WILLARL WARN UR.
The following extract of a letter addressed
to the Special Commissioner of the Revenue
by D. W. Tuthill, who, during the years 18G7
and 18G8. was in part manager and proprietor
of a well-known pig-metal furnace, located
at Durham, Buck's eonniy, Pennsyvania, also
throws much light on this subject:
Ti;oy, New York, January 21,1870.

book* with a view of writ in? you, becauso I am sat-
isfied that the estimate you mako of the cost ol iron
