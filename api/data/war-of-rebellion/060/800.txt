HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA,Cumberland, Md., April 4, 1864.

Colonel E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: I take leave to direct the attention of the Secretary of War to the letter inclosed,* and respectfully request that twelve 30-pounder Parrotts with the necessary ammunition and other material may be sent to this department immediately, eight of them to remain at Cumberland to arm the intrenchments under construction and nearly finished, and four to be sent to New Creek for the same purpose. Cumberland and New Creek are at present almost open and unprotected places. If the forts are armed and receive a small garrison, these cities will not be exposed to raids and surprises and will be able to resist a formal attack made by largely superior numbers. I therefore hope that my request be approved, and the Ordnance Department instructed to send the guns.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.
