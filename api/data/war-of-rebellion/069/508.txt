[HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, June 2, 1864.]

Brigadier General W. T. H. BROOKS,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: You will form your column on the left bank of the ravine, and make a direct assault upon the work, provided there be space enough to operate between General Martindale's column and the troops of Sixth Corps. Should this not be the case, you will be ordered to co-operate with General Martindale on the right bank of the ravine. The necessity of keeping out a heavy line of skirmishers and flankers is particularly impressed upon you. Should any artillery position be found useful, Captain Elder will furnish the artillery when you call upon him. You will give instructions to your ordnance officer to procure such ammunition as you may require, which will be promptly brought up during the fight. The instructions concerning artillery position, &c., skirmishers and ascertains in there be room between General Martindale and right of Sixth Corps to operate. General Martindale will remain in his present position, with lines extended, till further orders.

By command of Major General W. F. Smith:

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, June 2, 1864.

Brigadier General J. H. MARTINDALE,Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs that you form your command to-night, and move at 4.30 a. m. to-morrow down the ravine on the left of the present position of Colonel Henry. You will endeavor to get in rear of and capture the battery which now enfilades the rifle-pits taken yesterday. You will move in column of flankers on right flank. Should the ravine be found impracticable on account of natural obstacles, or be so strongly fortified as to preclude the chances of gaining it by assault, you will form your command on the right bank of the ravine with a development of front dictated by circumstances and the character of the ground, and assault the enemy's works at the nearest point. Should the assault be successful, the attack will be pushed till some strong commanding position is gained.

By command of Major General William F. Smith:

N. BOWEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
