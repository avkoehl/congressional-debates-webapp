Captain Whittington, of Vincent's regiment, has recently by force marches surprised a band of 10 jayhawkers on the Mermentou River. Twelve have been shot, and the remaining 7 are on trial before a commission. They will doubtless be executed. My orders are to shoot all jayhawkers taken in arms. A commission sits merely to verify the fact that the parties were so taken. So soon as Colonel bush can organize the regiment lately authorized, the region west of Opelousas will be cleared out of these marauders.

I presume Major Doublas will soon be here in person to decide what changes in his plans the recent movement of the enemy up the Ouachita will necessitate.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST LOUISIANA,Alexandria, March 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General BOGGS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report as follows: The boats recently in the Ouachita have returned to the Mississippi, and there are now twelve lying at the mouth. Eleventh feet reported on the bar at the entrance, and river falling at the rate of 8 inches per day; same rate of fall in the Atachfalaya. Twenty transports laden with horses have passed down within a week.

On the 4th instant a brigade of cavalry was marching down the La Fourche toward Berwick Bay. Troops are still returning from Texas to the same point. Spies from La Fourche represent all the enemy's infantry moving to the bay, but there is no report from Colonel Vincent for the last two days. If the enemy is concentrating anything more than cavalry at the bay he had changed his plans since Sherman's visit to New Orleans, and an advance of Banks' whole force by the Teche will indicate co-operation by Sherman from Vicksburg or Natches. I am anxiously awaiting news from Vincent to verify the La Fourche report. It can hardly be supposed that Grant will permit any forces under his command to leave the principal theater of operations, yet common sense forbids the idea that Banks would move from the Teche as a base with his entire force without Sherman's co-operation. The possession of monroe, Harrisonburg, Alexandria, and Washington is much desired by the Federals, as this would entirely cut off communication with the East, secure the navigation of the Mississippi from annoyance, and enable the pet scheme of colonization to be carried on. The next report from the Teche will decide the point as to the intentions of Banks. General Walker reports that ten days will complete De Russy. Captain Devoe, engineer in charge, desires the planters on the river to send down the drift as rapidly as possible. From present appearance at the raft he states that if drift is sent down at once in sufficient quantities a most formidable obstruction to the passage of boats will be insured. The planters in the vicinity of Shreveport can be most speedily notified from department headquarters.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Major-General.
