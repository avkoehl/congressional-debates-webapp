Keceuer of Pulhc Money, Columbus, Mississippi
This refers to the previous defaults, and shows
that Mr   Woodbury was cognizant of ttieru
The next month he writes again
Treasury Dcp ixtmesít, March 17,183a
Sin    Hiving ¡received no month!} duplicate iciurn of the
transactions ot your otftce since til it tor tile monttl of Oc
tober last, it becomes my unpleasant duty to call your ira
mediate attention to the omission    Allow me to express a
liopi that there may be no further occasion to rum id you
of the importance of punctuality in the transmission of
these returns
I am, &c ,                            LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury
W  P  Harris, Columbus, Mississippi
Here, it seems, Harris was in arrear for four
returns, in othei words, had violated fourpaia-
moimt duties.
But Mi Woodbury is a man of long suffering,
so he writes again, and with some seventy He
is determined to be trifled with no longer Hear
him

I think, if Mr Hams don't make his returns
now, he's a gone case, the Sectetary is tn earnest
Here is another letter    Let us set
Trfasury Department, Jlu°ust 28 I83o
Sir Agreeajly to the mt m uion e,iven you ui mv letter
of the 2Jth June it has become my disagree able dutv to
report your continued neglect to the President, «ho lias
instructed me to say to you that if the monthly returns re
quired from you by the reflations of the 1 rea ury winch

There, sn, I told you so If Mr Harris don't
make his returns by the 10th of October, lie will
be dismissed, the President htmstlf has said it,
and General Jackson is a man of Ins woid
In the mean time, however, the Secretaiy give3
him another hint

And now, sir, I am sorry to say this contuma-
cious iceeivei paid no attention to these kind warn
ings and li lendly solicitations He did not maite
his i etui ns, the 10th of October is passed, and Mr
Harris is doubtless íemoved, for General Jack
son and Levi Woodbury have both said it But,
softly heie is a lettet dated the 12th of Octobei,
no doubt it is the letter of dismissal Let's read it
Trfasury Department, October 12 183a
Sir Trusting to the assunnccs ¡riven m yom letter of
t ie 14th ultimo, and to tiio e 01 your friends m ide in j our
behalf, the Piesident has consented up >n the facts now
before him, to continue you m office until the 12th of No
vember proximo, then, unless your monthly returns are all
rendered, and satisfactory evidence that the wholt of the
public moneys Willi which vou aie chargeable Rredepis
ited, [is received ] you mu t he removed Irani ofiice, how

W P Harris, E rf ,
Receiver of Pul tic Money, Columbus  Mississijjn
Well, this is strange' arepneve1 and based
upon Mr Harus's letter of the 14th ultimo'
Why, the Stcretary says in his last, that the lea-
sons given in this lettei of the 14th ultimo, for
withholding the letums, aie unsatisfactory that
he can perceive no sufficient cause for then being
delayed
1 wish Levi would explun why he and  Gen-
eial Jackson violated then pledge in this case    I
confess I do not undei stand it    1 thought if liar
us did not make his íetuins he would ceitainly ,
be removed     But if he does not make all   his
returns and deposits by the 1,2th of Novembei,
he will positively have to go, " howevei  pain
ful" to both the Piesident and  the D-partment
Lest he should forget all about the  matter, the
Secretaiy in a ftw d lys wutes again

Sir, the 12th of November arrived and passed,
and yet Harris had failed to deposit the public
moneys with which he was chargeable, atcoid-
mg to the ipquisition of the St letaiy's letter
Of couise he was dismissed without fuithei hes
nation, you exclaim Not so fast, do not be
rash in your conclusions I have become suspi
cious about the mdttet since the reprieve I do
not believe now he was icmoved at all
And, suie enough he was not Here is the
very next letter fiom the Department, talking to
htm as mildly as if he had never offtndtd
Treasofy DtPARTMcl*T, November 28  183")
Sir Your letter of the 11 th instint and return tor the
month of October, is received As your deposits of public
moneys are made it Columbus no rets>n whatever c 11 be
seen why the wnole mom y in jour hands at the end of the

W  P Harris  Esq

Vei y true, no íeason can be seen why he should
not have deposited the money,and no íeason can
be seen why he was not removed for failing so
long and so íepeatedly to do it But to the cor
respondence

W P Harris E q ,
Receiver of Public Moneys, Columbus, Mississippi
Why, Mr Secretary, you are crawling out at
the same place you crept m This is the tune
you plaved at the commencement* It is lather
too late in the day to think of frightening Harris
now, by threatening to turn him out, v hen he
and everybody else know you never intend to do
it
Mi Chairman, let me crave your patience.
We are neatly through this case, and then we
will rest for a moment The following letter be-
gins to exhibit the catastrophe.
Treasury Department, June 6,1836
Sir Your letter of the 23d ultimo, accompanied by your
returns for the month of April, is received Seeing the
bdance of public moneys in your hands omounttd to
§i2t¡ 884 70 at the end of tint month, I havt to request tb it
vou will explain why it was that the whole of the public
moneys in jour hands on the last of the previous month
was notdepo ited instead or a pan,in conformity to ex
plicit ai d liequent instructions on tint point It is painful
to be oblif d to ask you so otten for explanations
I am  &c ,                            LEVI WOODBUKY,
Secretary of the Treasury
Recliveu of Public Moneys, Columbus, Mississippi
Yes, I should suppose it was painful
The Sec retary is truly a man of much patience
He must be a lineal descendant of Job     He gives
to his subordinates "line upon line," "precept
upon precept," " here a little " and thete a gieat
deal     Hestnves haid to teach them honesty
Whether his ill success is attributable to master
or pupils, I will not pretend to say
At length Mr Hams does what neithei the
Piesident nor the Secretary dare to do—he dis-
misses himself fmm office, m other words, lit re-
signs
Trfasury Department, September 21, 1836

lie íesigns, a defaulter foi $100,000 He had
quite a modctate appetite, compaied withSwait-
wout and some others
TliPie is but one moie morsel of this coire-
spondence on record, and it is of a piece with the
balance It consists of íegret on the part of the
Secietary that legal steps had been taken " to at-
tempt to secure" what was due the Government
Treasir\ Dcparimfnt, fioiemlcr 19, 1836
Sir I Have rtci ivtd yom letter of Hit 1st m tant, by
the mail of this nv mm, and regret to inform vou th it, as
Ion  a"o as Align t last, steps were taken by the Solicitor
of the"! reasury to attempt to secure the balance due from
Tain, &c ,                            LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury
W   P Harris E q , Columbus, Mississippi
Now, will any one dare deny that General
Jackson and Sectetaiy Woodbuiy were literally
guilty of this defalcation' Did it not result fiom
then willful neglect of duty—fiom absolute and
unqualified connivance' For two years anda
half this leceivei was never for a single instant
out of default, he was dunng that whole period
in continued violation of the acknowledged "para-
mount duties of his office " The Secretai y was
awaie of the whole of it The case at length be-
comes so ripe that it falls of itself—a good round
golden apple of the value of $11)0,001) and up-
waids Ard yet the Secretary swears that no
such fruit grows in his garden
But let us again take a bud's eye view of this
correspondence Let us group it without giving
the exact language, we will take the meaning—
the idea
Lettei 1st   Mr  Hams, I am sorry to tell you
a°-am, you hav'nt made youi return'
