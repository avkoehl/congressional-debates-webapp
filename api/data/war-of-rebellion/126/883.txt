DOCUMENT Numbers 30.

Necessity for a change in the method of raising troops.

From the results of the draft above discussed and of the call preceding it for 300,000 volunteers, it became apparent that, without further legislation, the armies could not be sufficiently strengthened to prosecute the war successfully and that in the re-enforcements which had been and were being furnished a ruinous inequality was arising among the different States and districts.

The necessity for a change of system in raising troops was recognized by President Lincoln, as shown by a letter from him dated August 4, 1862, to Count A. de Gasparin, from which the following is an extract:

Hence our great Army * * * has dwindled rapidly, bringing the necessity for a new call earlier than was anticipated. We shall easily obtain the new levy, however. Be not alarmed if you shall learn that we shall have resorted to a draft for part of this. It seems strange even to me, but it is true, that the Government is now pressed to this course by a popular demand. Thousands who wish not to personally enter the service are nevertheless anxious to pay and send substitutes,

*As published with the final report of the Provost-Marshal- General, these Regulations differ in some respects from those printed in Vol. IV, this series, p. 651 et seq. A comparison with House Executive Document Numbers 1, Thirty-ninth Congress, first session, Vol. IV, Part II, p. 276 et seq, will disclose the differences.
