General HOOKER,

Dumfries:

My scouts from Chester and Ashby's Gaps report the rebel General Stuart, with 15, 000 cavalry, at Upperville. The people, in that vicinity, both white and black, state that Longstreet is supporting Stuart with 30, 000 men. Heave firing in the direction of Winchester all day long. Stuart was moving in a direction to strike the Potomac between Leesburg and Harper's Ferry. He was moving slowly. Two other corps, 30, 000 men each, under A. P. Hill and Ewell, are still south of the Rappahannock; Hill to cross in our rear at Banks' and United States Fords, Ewell at Sulphur Springs. This last comes from a prisoner.
