ought he not to fall back on Camp Nelson or this place by land? Lebanon can be reached by telegraph, via Danville.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

LEXINGTON, ky., July 4, 1864.

General BOYLE:

General Judah telegraphs that the whole of Morgan's force (4,000 to 5,000 strong) have advanced toward Columbia; thinks he is going to strike railroad about Bacon Creek; that force at Manfordville should be strengthened. You can ordered the Twentieth Kentucky there, and make any other disposition you please od forces under your control. Notify Colonel Pennebaker, and make arrangements, if it becomes absolutely necessary, to destroyed the stores there. Strong cavalry force will intercept him, if possible, at Greensburg, and Judah is following him up sharply as possible.

Major-General.

JULY 4, 1863.-9.45.

Major-General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

The force at Lebanon has been re-enforced by troops from Stanford and Camp Nelson. Hanson has been ordered to fall back on Camp Nelson if troops do not reach him in time. I learn that the troops left Indianapolis about 7 p. m.

A. E. BURNSIDE.

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, July 4, 1863-10.20. (Received 10.45.)

General BURNSIDE:

If there are any troops as Indianapolis in Ohio, had they not better be sent here? Morgan has got on around our forces, and threatens the railroad. Morgan has 4,50 men. I had no force under my command to protect the road. I reported the troops have moved from Columbia, and believe part of Carter's division will have to be moved to Lebanon or other point. Morgan's men are mounted, and it will be difficult to engage them except at his option.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.

CINCINNATI, July 4, 1863.

General BOYLE:

I have ordered from Indianapolis all the available troops-one regiment of infantry and possibly some artillery. Please have subsistence ready for them, as they will leave Indianapolis in haste. All of Judah's and a portion of Carter's command are after Morgan. Notify the railroad guards that they must hold their position if they are attacked until our troops come up. Keep a lookout for Louisville, as he may make a dash on you should his forces get far in advance of ours. I hope our troops will be able to catch him.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
