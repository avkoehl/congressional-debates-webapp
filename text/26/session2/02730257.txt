disturbing the usual harmony and pood fveliog
which prevaded in the Senate, to which he had
alluded; and he bore, with pleasure, testimony to the
honorable and high minded feelings which had
prompted that Senator to make the appeal which
he had just presented.
Before he (Mr. C.) proceeded to respond particu-
larly to that appeal, he wished to submit n few
general observations to the Senate m regard to
the privileges of Congressional or Parliamentary
debate.
Every Senator had  the most  perfect  right to
speak  with   the  utmost  freedom of   ihose   who
were in power; he mtgnt renounce  them as arbi-
trary, wicked, and  incompetent,  and  fhe.r mea-
sures as  tyrannical, corrupt, and ruinous  to the
best interests of the country.   So it was equally
the right of every memher to deliver his sentiments
without reserve on the character of all persons not
members c.f the body, but  Those names or cha-
racters wereconnected with the subj ct underdeb:Xe.
and all brought before the Senate as candidates f> r
appointment to office.   All  this a member has a
right to do under no other rcsoonsibihty than that
which his own conscience and public opinion im-
pose. But while this right wa* clear and undeniable,
was essential to the due discharge of official doty,
and was in no case to be be restrained, the same liber-
ty did not extendió the language oí Senators towards
each other, or in reference to their motives.   In
speaking to or of each other, the utmost respect
and decorum ought ever to be preserved, all per-
sonality ayoided, and especially a", imputation of
improper motives.    Undo alíese inipjessio*is as io
the privileges of debate, and guided by these riles,
Mr. C. had spoken, a fea days since, o>  the elder
Editsr of the Globe newspaper, whom it v, as   ;hen
proposed to dismiss from the office rf Priste- í> the
Senate.    Had not that individual been thus legiti-
mately and directly before the body, he should have
forborne, as he had always hitherto, in hi-, oub'ic
station, forborne, to say a word in r<-s rd '■<•■ him or
the  paper  which  he edits.    Notwithstanding fen
years of the most unparalleled abuse and wae'on
and unscrupulous aitacks of himself, Mr.  0. h:-d
remained silent; and so he sho-iM  sail  have re-
mained; but when the name of that person was di-
rectly before the Sépate,  and  his character and
conduct of a public journal became a If-sitnnate
subject for its coasideraiion, he had felt it to h  his
right to speak of him in the terms he had d nr.
When, on ¡he next day, the Senator from Al-:b?.:na
(Mr. Kino) addressed the Senate, he most say thai,
while that gentleman was speaking, he had thought
that there.was, on his part, a studied, a premeditat-
ed, and, as he then believed, a preconcerted design
to make an assault upon him and his character.
And when the Senator concluded by instituting a
comparison of Mr. C. to a man whom he had, but
the day before, declared to be infamous, and of
whom he had spoken as a common libeller, and
of his paper as libellous, he did not doubt that his
object was a personal offence to  Mr. C.    It was
under this impression that Mr. C. had addressed io
the Chair some remarks which he intended as a
deliberate offence to that Senator.
But it was due to the Senator from Alabama, S3
well as to himself, to state that he had since re-
ceived satisfactory information, oa which he placed
implicit reliance, that there had been no purpose or
intention on the part of lhat Senator to offer any
personal affront to Mr. C. or to cast the stightes1
imputation on his character or honor. Mr Chad.
therefore, beers mistaken as to the design which he
had supposed that Senator to entertain; and he
must have entirely misapprehended the language
employed. Ready, therefore, at all times prompt-
ly to repair an injury, as he hoped he ever should be
to repel an indignity, and always taking more plea-
sure to repair than to repel, and without any regard
to the nicety of mere fechaical forms, io which
ihose acquainted with him well knew he never at-
tached great impof'anee—under the circumstances
as thus explained, and wi-h the understanding
which he now bad of the real intentions of tint Se-
nator, it was with infinite pleasure he now de-
clared every epithet in ihe least derogatory to him,
to his honor, or to his character, to be withdrawn.
Mr. KING- said: I concur with the Senator from
Kentucky as to the duty which every Set ator < we
to himself and to ihe body ot which he is a mem-
ber. He should studiously avo d all personalties,
and keep hirase'f strictly within the rule? oí order,
and K! ver depart from decorum in deb-V?, I have
long been a number of tie. Senate, .-.nil Í can fear-
les-ly appeal to my brother Sena-ors to say,
whe'h"r, on any occasion, I hare vi hi ted pre-
scribed mies, or been guilty of oidecium in de-
bato.
