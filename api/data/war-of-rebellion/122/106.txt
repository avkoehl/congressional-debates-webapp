sadly deficient, and we want and need and should have rifled cannon. Let me urge earnestly and frankly that the works at Chicopee be but in operation to their utmost capacity to furnish them. I speak the opinions of our best men here, and I feel there should be no delay. It is of the utmost importance.

Yours, truly,

H. HAMLIN.

Let the suggestion of the Vice-President as to putting the Chicopee works into operation be duly considered by the War Department.

NEW YORK CITY, April 23, 1861.

[General SCOTT:
GENERAL: I will avail myself of this opportunity to communicate to you the part I have acted in the present state of the country. The first moment I was well enough I visited Albany, at the request of the Governor, to render such services as seemed indispensable under existing circumstances, as all direct communication was cut off with Washington. I did not hesitate to advise the most energetic measures, and to send troops as fast as they could get them ready to Washington. I gave orders to Colonel Tompkins to furnish transportation and to Major Eaton thirty days' provisions. I have ordered, upon the application of the Governor of Pennsylvania, 10,000 muskets from the New York Arsenal and 40,000 cartridges from Watertown Arsenal to be sent direct to harrisburg. I shall probably send 10,000 muskets and 400,000 cartridges, upon application from the Governor of Ohio, to Columbus. He says he has no ammunition or arms. We have received returns from the Allegheny, Frankfort, and Kennebec arsenals and from Springfield Armory. At the Allegheny Arsenal we have 3,000 muskets, old pattern, 500,000 ball and buckshot cartridges, 20,000 elongated bullet cartridges, 800,000 rifled cartridges, .58-inch. Frankfort Arsenal has been nearly emptied by orders from Washington. There are, however, 3,000 muskets and 117,000 cartridges for rifle muskets on hand at the last advices. At Watertown Arsenal there are, after deducting the arms and ammunition sent to Governors Curtin and Dennison, about 8,000 percussion muskets, 60-inch; 6,000 percussion rifles, 54-inch; 70,000 musket cartridges, percussion; 1,400,000 musket cartridges, flint-lock; 196,000 rifle cartridges, percussion; 717,00 rifle cartridges, flint-lock. At Kennebec Arsenal are 43,000 musket cartridges reported "old," and I fear they are unfit for service. At Springfield Armory there are 86,000 muskets of the old pattern and they are making 60 of the new pattern daily. No musket accouterments on hand at any of the above names places.

Upon the application of the Committee of Safety of this city I have directed Colonel Tompkins to charter two light-draft steamers with the least possible deadly to ply between Havre de Grace and Annapolis and to put on board as much provisions for the use of the troops South as will not impede their passage.

I have requested the Governor of New Jersey to send two companies of militia or volunteers to Fort Delaware for its protection. I have also put myself in communication with the Governors of Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, and Indiana, and shall use every exertion in my power to facilitate the Army and provide for the troops destinate to
