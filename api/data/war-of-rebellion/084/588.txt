GEORGE W. BOARDMAN,

JOHN S. McFARLAND,

Boonville, Mo.:

Your dispatch of yesterday was referred to Major-General Pleasonton who replies that he is doing all he can with the force at his command for the protection of the river towns. His statement is correct and no more troops can at present be sent to him. General Pleasonton suggests and the general commanding coincides in the opinion that a town of the size of Boonville ought to be able to raise a militia force of sufficient size to protect itself against any small band of roving bushwhackers.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BOONVILLE, MO., August 6, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

We do not fear small bands of rebels. We have reliable information that the rebel force in Saline County numbers over 400 men, and that they are preparing to attack this city with a larger force, and it is the opinion of sober men that a successful defense cannot be made. The capture of the city would obtain supplies enough to equip 2,000 rebels and cause a loss to Government of $2,000,000 if this office is captured.

GEO. W. BOARDMAN,

Register.

JOHN S. McFARLAND,

Receiver.

JOHN S. McFARLAND,

Boonville, Mo.:

Your second dispatch received. All of General Pleasonton's available force is now in Saline County, and actively engaged in pursuit of the party of rebels that you fear. There are no forces at the disposal of General Rosecrans which can at present be spared from other vital points.

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, August 6, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS, Lawrence, Kans:

All well and everything quiet. Let us know when you will be here.
