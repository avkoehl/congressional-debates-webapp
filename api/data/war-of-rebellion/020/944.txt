ready overburdened to supply the wants of the armies in the field. When the Russians burnt Moscow it was for the purpose of annihilating Napoleon's army of 300,000 or 400,000 men, which has invaded their country. When they again consented to the slow but certain destruction of Sebastopol it was to prevent the allies from taking possession of its immense docks, arsenals, military stores, and the fleet which had sought refuge under the guns of its forts. The possession of the harbor of Sebastopol would also have afforded them a magnificent base for their future operations in the Crimea. As I have already remarked, the river being extremely high, the streets of New Orleans could have been swept from one extremity to the other by the heavy guns of the enemy's fleet; or had Commodore Farragut preferred reducing the place to submission without using his guns it would have been only necessary submission without using his guns it would have been only necessary to have cut the levee above and below the city and the whole population would have been utterly defenseless and in a starving condition in a few days. Without the command of the Mississippi River New Orleans in not worth holding as a military or strategies point.
