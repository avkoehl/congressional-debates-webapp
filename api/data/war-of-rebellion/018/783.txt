ON MADISON ROAD, [August - 1862]-11.58.

[General McDOWELL:]

Last report from cavalry pickets say small force of cavalry and infantry, not certainly more than a regiment, probably less, are retiring toward Madison.

Do you wish me to go any farther from the army? I am about 2 miles distant; the cavalry battalion 1 mile farther.

With respect,

Z. B. TOWER,

Brigadier-General.
