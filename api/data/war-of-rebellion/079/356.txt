LEXINGTON, KY., October 18, 1864.

Brigadier-General MEREDITH:

I am trying to get re-enforcement for you. Keep your cavalry all out and get accurate information. If attacked you can hold Paducah and Columbus until assistance reaches you.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General.

JOHNSONVILLE, October 18, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

My cavalry has been left at Clifton. General Forrest, from the best information I can obtain, is at Corinth and Eastport, with complete railroad communication from Mobile to Cherokee. Shall I send my cavalry back to Memphis? I think there may be some hazard in crossing the country. The Tennessee is rapidly falling, and Forrest can return to Middle Tennessee whenever he likes, unless there is an adequate force to oppose him. My infantry here, under Colonel Hoge, I will send back to Memphis to insure the safety of that point, but my cavalry can be used to pursue Forrest if desired. It seems to me that he should not be allowed to remain where he is, and that the Mobile and Ohio Railroad should be destroyed. Forrest had two regiments watching us opposite Savannah. He may have swung off toward Georgia before now, but he makes great use of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, and as long as that remains he will greatly annoy both Middle and WEST Tennessee.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, October 18, 1864.

Major General C. C. WASHBURN:

Your dispatch of this day received, and I send you the following from Major-General Sherman for your information and guidance:

SHIP'S GAP, October 17, 1864 - 2 p. m.

Order in my name the renewal of the attempt to get Eastport, and ask Admiral Porter, if necessary, to send up an iron-clad. We should command the Tennessee River up to Muscle Shoals perfectly.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

I have applied by telegraph to Admiral Porter for the iron-clad, and I desire to know whether you can collect a sufficient force of infantry, to act in conjunction with your cavalry and the iron-clad and gun-boats, to lead you to hope for a successful attack upon and capture of Eastport. Answer by telegraph, letting me know what force you can collect, and how soon you can start upon the expedition. It should be done so soon as possible.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

JOHNSONVILLE, October 18, 1864.

Major General G. H. THOMAS:

I have 2,700 cavalry and 1,200 infantry and two pieces of artillery. We should have double that force. I will see you this evening.

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major-General.
