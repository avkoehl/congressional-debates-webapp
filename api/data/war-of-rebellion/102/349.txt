Major-General POPE:

Colonel Blair and General Sanborn report body of bushwhackers, 300 strong, working north; crossed Arkansas River west of Fort Gibson; came through Indian Nation. Colonel Harding reports two bands on line of Union Pacific Railroad about 100 strong. They killed four teamsters on railroad; says our troops are on them. The ground on Osage River has been overflowed, so it is impossible to cross troops. Major Cooper's battalion surrendered to General Sanborn and took the oath.
