with it poorly mounted. As Johnson's division was organized with a view to its being left for the defense of the country north of the Tennessee, it might be dismounted entirely and its horses turned over to the other troops, provided, however, any troops are necessary north of the Tennessee; but Upton's, Knipe's, and Hatch's divisions should be supplied with as little delay as possible, even if active operations do not begin before spring. The sooner the horses are in the hands of the men the sooner they can be inured to the service. I have written fully to Major Chambliss in regard to this matter, but I would suggest to you that as soon as the corps can be concentrated at Eastport all the horses required should be sent to that point by steam-boat, for in that case I shall be able to concentrate the men of the corps and establish the divisions and brigades. Please inform me, at Eastport, what chance there is of securing the Spencer carbines for the entire command, and how fast, under an extraordinary pressure, the horses can be furnished. The recent campaign has been very severe upon our horses, many of them having been selected from broken-down horses of previous campaigns, and all having been subjected in this to hard work and poor feed. The grease-heel and hoof-rot are again making their appearance. The disease seems to be the same in different forms; attacks officers' horses, as well as those of the men, and no amount of care will prevent it. I have lost three valuable animals myself, notwithstanding the careful treatment they have habitually received. I attribute the disease to overwork, mud roads, and corn, without proper corn or other long forage. You will be glad to know, however, that the services of the cavalry under its organization have been commended in the highest degree by General Thomas, and justly warrant us in hoping that its future career will prove the wisdom of the measures already instituted for its benefit. During the campaign twenty-two guns, eight battle-flags, and nearly 3,000 prisoners were taken by it from breast-works and in open field fights with the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Major WILLIAM P. CHAMBLISS,Special Insp. Cav., Mil. Div. of the Mississippi, Louisville, Ky.:

MAJOR: I inclose for your information a copy of a letter addressed to General Whipple upon the supposition that we should be permitted to go into winter quarters and get ready for spring operations.* Since then the indications are that this will not be permitted, and that we may be called upon for active operations at any day. In view of this contingency, I would like to have Upton's division got ready as soon as possible, and after it Knipe's; Johnson's division, having been organized for the defense of the country north of the Tennessee River, may be supplied last. Fearing that operations may be precipitated upon us before the Bureau, in the regular course of business, could supply all the horses necessary, I have suggested to General Thomas the propriety of sending the dismounted men north of the Ohio River, with authority from the Secretary of War to impress horses. During the recent cam-
