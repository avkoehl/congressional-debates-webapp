GENERAL: In view of the possible movement of the enemy upon Fairfax Court-House I respectfully inquire if it would not be prudent that trains and artillery be stopped proceeding along the Little River turnpike until a cavalry reconnaissance shall show what operations, if any, the enemy may have made in that quarter? There are some batteries of Sumner's corps ready to start.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

The destinies of our country, the honor of our arms, are at stake, and all depends now upon the cheerful co-operation of all in the field. This week is the crisis of our fate. Say the same thing to my friends in the Army of the Potomac, and that the last request I have to make of them
