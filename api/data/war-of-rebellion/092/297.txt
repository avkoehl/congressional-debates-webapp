The enemy having evacuated the city of Savannah on the night previous, on the morning of the 21st, about 4 o'clock, I was ordered to withdraw the regiments upon the island and march the brigade forward to the line of works formerly occupied by the enemy, and upon arriving there the general commanding division sent me orders to march to the city. Arriving in the city I was assigned the city parade-grounds, or Forsyth Place, as a ground for encampment, and the brigade assigned to the duty of guarding and patrolling a district of the city.

The casualties of the brigade during the operations embraced in this report were slight. A tabular statement accompanies this report. The officers and men of the command behaved with much consideration and propriety of conduct during the march, and but few instances of wanton destruction of property or pillage occurred.

To the officers of the staff I am under obligations for the faithful and diligent discharge of the duties devolving upon them.

All of which is respectfully submitted.
