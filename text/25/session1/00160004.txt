The act of the 23d of June, 1836, regulating the
•deposites 0f the puf'ic money, and directing the
«Éftoyraent of State, District, and 1 erntoi íal banl s
for that puipose, inad( it the duly of the Secictary
o*" the Treasury to discontinue the use ot such of
them as should at any time refuse to redeem then
notes in specie, and to substitute othei banks, pro-
vided a sufficient number could be obtained to re
ceive the public deposites upon the terms and con-
ditions there.n prescribed    The general and almost
simultaneous suspension of specie payments bj the
banks m May last, rendered the perlorma-.ee of
his duly imperative, in respect to those which had
Icen^lpfted  under the act, and made it, at the
s me tu    , impractical le to employ the uqmsite
rumibu of others, upoa the prescribed conditions
The specific regulations established by Congress lot
the deposite and safe keeping of the public money s
having thus unexpectedly   become inopciative, I
felt u to be mv duty to a Tori you an early oppór-
tinily forihe exercise of your supervisoiy powers
t vcr the • ebject
1 w as also ltd to apprehend that the suspension

I) foi o c\ ung in the pecuniary affairs of the coun-
tiy, ' ouid so I ii dimmish the public revenue, that
the accruing riceipls into the Treasury, would not,
with the rtseivtd five millions, be sufficient to de-
ft i) tin unavoidable expenses ot the Government,
un il ib., usu ii pcuod lor ihe meeting of Congress',
mIi Ki tht minority lo c ill upon the States, for a
poitnn i f the sums deposited with them, was too
resti i le \ to enable tht Depaitment to leal ze a suf-
ficient amount fiom that source These appiehen-
Moas bene been justified by subsequent lesulis
which lender i' certain that this deficiency will ot-
cui, if adili íonal means be not provided by Con-
giess
Ile dilhcultits experienced by the mercantile
miere I m meeting their engagement*, mluced
ih n to apply lo me, prevn usly to the actual sus-
peisoifi spect payments for indulgence upon
their bonds í< i dut es, and all the relief authorized
by law vv as pr inaptly and cheeifullj granted The
dependente ot ti s Treasury upon the avails of
these bonds, to enable it to make the deposites with
the States required by law, led me in the outset to
limit this indulgence to the first of September, but
uhas since been extended to the first of October
that the matter might be submitted to your further
ct le lion
Questions were also expected to arise in the re-
I cess m rpspect to the October instalment of those
deposites, requuw¿ ti l interposition of Congress
A provision oí another act, passed about the
same time, and intended to secure a faithful
compliance w ith the obligation of the United Sfates,
to satisfy all demands upon them m specie or its
equivalent, prohibited the offer of any bank note,
not convertible on the spot into gold oi silvei at the
will of the boldei, and the ability of the Govern-
ment, with millions on deposite, to meet its engage-
ments in the manner thus required by law, was
rendered very doubtful by the event to which I have
refci red
Sensible tint adequate provisions for these
unexpecttd exigencies could only be made by
Congress, convinced that some of them would
be indispensably necessary to the public service,
before the regular period of your meeting,
and desirous also to enable y ou to exerc «e,
at the earliest moment, your full constitutional
powers foi the relief of the count) y, I could not,
with piopnety, avoid subjecting you to the inconve-
nience of assembling at as early a day as the stale
of the popular representation would permit I am
sure that I have done but justice to your feelings,
in believing that this in' onvemence will be cheer-
fully encountered, in ihe hope of rendering your
meeting conducive to the good of ihe country
During the eaihci st?ges of the revulsion through
which we hare just passed, much acrimonious dis-
cussion arose andgreat diversity oi opinion existed,
as to its real causes This was not surprising
The operations of credit are so diveisified, and
the influences which affect them so numerous, and
often so subtle, that even impartial and wel'-in-
formed peisons are seldom found to agiee in re
spect to them To inherent difficult es were also
added other tendencies, which were by no mears
favorable lo the discovery of truth It w as h irdly
lo be expeled, that those who d sappioved the poli-
cy of the Government in rclatu n to the cunency,
would, in the excited state of public ieehng pro-
duced by the occasion, fail to attribute to that polity
any extensive embairassment m the monetary ai-
fairsoi the countiy The matter thusbecame con-
nect! d w uh the pasnons and conflicts of paity, opi-
nions were moie or less affected by political consi
derations, and differences were prolonged which
might othei wise have been detc-n ined bv an ap-
peal to fat ts by the exeieise of leason, or by mu-
tual conctssion Ttis n iwever,acheeun0 reflection,
that < ireumstances of this nature cannot prevent
a community so in elhgent as ours from ultimately
aTiv mg rt correct conclusions Encouraged by
the fnm belief of this (ruth, I proceed lo state
my views, so fat as may be necessary to a clear
untie i standing ol the remedies I feel it my duty to
propose, and ot the reasons by which I have been
led to recommend them
The history of trade in the United State' for the
last thiee oi four yean, affords the most con\mcmg
evidence that our prestn' condition is chiefly to be
attributed to over-ac tion in all tne departments of
business an over-action deiivmg, peihaps, its fust
impulses Irom antecedent causes, but stimulated
to    us   destructive   consequences    by    excessive
issues tí bank paper, and by  other facilities foi
the  acquisition and  enlargement of  ciedit     At
the co nmencement of the year  1834, the bank-
ing capital of the United States, including that
oí   the   national bank then existing,   amounted
to about two hundred millions of dollars , the bank
notes then m circi lation to about ninety-five mil
lions, ai d the loans and discounts of the banks to
three hundied and tvventy-foui millions     Between
that time and the first ot January, 1836, being the
latest pcuod to whicn accuiate accounts have k en
ieceived,om banking capital was increased to more
than two hundrel and fifty one millions, our paper
circulation to more than one hundied and forty
millions, and the loans and discounts to moie than
four hundred and fitly-seren millions   To this vast
increase  are  to  be added  the many millions of
credit acoimcd   >y   means of foieign loans, con-
tacted by the States  and  Slate institutions, anl
above all by Ihe lavish accommodations extended
by foieign dealeis to our merchants
The cons quences of this redundancy of credit
and of the spirit of reckless speculation engen-
dered by it, weie a foreign debt contracted by our
citizens, estimated in March last at more than thirty
millions of dolíais, the extension to traders in.
the interim of our country of ciedils for sup-
plies, greatly beyond the wants of the people,
the mv estment of thirty-nine and a half millions of
dollars in unproductive public lands, in the years
1S35 and 1836, whilst m Ihe preceding year the
sales amounted,to only foul and a half millions,
the creation of debts, to an almost countless amount,
for real estate m existing or anticipated cities and
villages, equally unproductive, and at prices now
seen to have been greatly disproportionate to their
eal value, the expenditure of immense sums in
impiovements which, in many cases, have been
found to be ruinousiv improvident, the diversion to
ollic pursuits of much of the labor that shoull
have been applied to agucultuie, thereby contri-
buting to the expenditure of large sums in 'he im-
portation of gran from Eurone—an expcndituie
which amounting in 1834 to about two hincLred.
and fifty thousand dollars, was, in the fust two
quarters of the present year, ntreased to more
than two millions tf dolHr-, and, finally, without
enumerating caer mjuiious re nils, the rapid
grow th among all classes, and especially in our
gieat commeicial towns, of luxunous habits,
founded too often on i eicly fancied wealth, ana
lelnmental alike to the mdustiy, the resources, and
he morals of our people
It was so impossible that such a state of things
could long continue that ti e prospect oí revulsion
was present to the minds of coi s derate men
befoie it actually came None, however, had cor-
rectly anticipated its seventy A concurrence of
encums'ances inadequate of themselves to produce
such wide-spread and calamitous embarrassments,
tended so greatly to ?ggrav ">te tl em, th?t tney can-
not be ovei looked m consid ring then history
Among these inav be mentioned ps most pron i-
nent, the gieat loss of c .pital sustaired by our
ccmmercial emponum in the fne of Deeember,
1835—a los , the effects of which weie underrated
at the time, because postponed for a season by the
great facilities of credit then existing, the disturbing
effects in our commercial cities, of the transfers of
the public moneys required by the dej ositc law of
une, 1836, and the measuies adopted by the fo-
ie>gn creditors of our merchants to reduce their
debts, and to withdraw from the Uni'ed Sta'es a
large portion of our specie
However unwilling any of our citizens may here-
toltre have b°eii to assign to thes* causes the th ef
mstiumentility in pioducmg the present state of
thm&s,  the  developments subseq lently made, and
the ?c ual cond tion of otuer commercial countries
must, as it seems to me, dispel all rema ning doubts'
upon the subject    It has since appeared that evi's,
similar to those suffeied by ourselves, have beeri
experienced in Great Britain, on the coi tment, and,
indeed, throighout the commeicial world , and that
m other countries, as vv ell as in our ow n, they hav c
been unifoimly preceded by an undue enlargement
of the boundaries of trade, piompteü, as with us,
by unpiecedenled expansions of the s_, stems of cre-
dit    A reference to the amount of banking capi-
tal, and the issues of rnpei credits put in c ícula-
tion in Great Btitam, by banks, and in other w ays
during  the   years   1834,  1835,   and   1836,   will
snow  an   augmentation   of  the  paper currency
there,   as   much   disproporlioncd   to   the   real
wants of nade as m  the United States    With
this redundancy of the paper currency, there aiose
in that country also a spirit of adventurous specu-
lation, embracing the whole range of human enter-
prise Aid was profusely given to projected improve-
ments, large investments were made m foreign
stocks and loans, credits for goods were  -"ranted
with unbounded liberality to merchants mloreign
countries, and all the means of acqumng and em-
ploying ciedit weie put m active operation, and ex-
tended in their effects to every department of busi-
ness, an I to every quarter of the globe    The re-
action was propoi tioned in its violence to the ex-
traordinary character of the events which preceded
it     The commercial community of Great Britain
were subjected to the greatest difficulties, and their
debtors in this country were not only suddenly de-
prived of accustomed and expected credits, but call-
