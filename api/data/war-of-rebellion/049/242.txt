Major-General MEADE,

Army of the Potomac:

Colonel McCallum recommends that the troops now at Warrenton Junction be encamped in the woods south of the station, so as to protect the water-tank and wood-choppers at the same time.

Please send me, as nearly as you can, the number of enemy's dead left in our hands at the battle of Gettysburg.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The general officers of the day have been reporting for several days that the enemy has been extending his works at Raccoon Ford, Morton's Ford, and above these places. I cannot account for this except that he intends to cover and sustain a movement in some other direction. Some of the officers on picket imagine that they have recognized a diminution of the force opposite us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
