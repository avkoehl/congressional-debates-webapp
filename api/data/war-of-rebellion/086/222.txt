General EWING:

Telegraph in order to Cape Girardeau, Bloomfield, and New Madrid I want to go to Kansas, but will straighten up matters here and start soon as the cars run here. Patterson is the key to this country and should be garrisoned. I will put up the wire this week. Can't some of the troops that went to Rolla from here be sent there? I send scout to Ponder's Mill, Cook's Settlement, and Farmington to-morrow. Detachment of the Tenth has been reported, but many of them are yet in Saint Louis on detached service.
