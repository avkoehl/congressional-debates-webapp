GENERAL: I am informed that the flag-of-truce boat will not leave Aiken's Landing before 1 p. m. to-morrow (Tuesday), and as I did not come to Richmond voluntarily to be detained in prison, but for the purposes I have heretofore stated to you, I respectfully request that you will permit me to return to the North by this present boat, and allow me to visit Governor Brown, Senator, and Mr. Boyce, Member of Congress, before I leave.

It will be necessary for me to leave Richmond by 11 a. m. to-morrow in order to reach the boat. I desire to see Judge Baxter also.

Your obedient servant,

WM. CHASE BARNEY.
