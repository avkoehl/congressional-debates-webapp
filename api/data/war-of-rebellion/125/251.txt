General JAMES B. FRY, U. S. Army,

Provost-Marshal-General, Washington:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your telegram of this date inquiring whether In think it advisable to procure to draft in the deficient sub-districts of the State, that all may be thus made to fill the quotas heretofore assigned, to which I would reply that as Connecticut had furnished up to the 1st of April 2,172 more men for three years" service than had been required the President, I don not think it desirable to order the draft in the deficient sub-districts unless the President shall made a requisition for more men. In the case I would recommend that the draft be made in sub-districts for deficient ment shall be made. I have no doubt but the plan suggested within is decidedly the best.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

WM. A. BUCKINGHAM,

Governor of Connecticut.
