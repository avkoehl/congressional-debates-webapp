not support them in idleness. They are expected to work, as heretofore, and will be paid accordingly. When questions arise in which you are in doubt, you will refer them to these headquarters for decision. You will receive the application in writing of all persons who wish to take the oath of amnesty, and after indorsing thereon all information you can gather in regard to the person so applying, will forward them to these headquarters for approval before administering the oath. Parties who are exempt from receiving the amnesty oath may make application to the President of the United States for special pardon, which must be forwarded through these headquarters. In forwarding such applications you will not indorse them, but will send a letter of advice with each application, giving all information you can gather in regard to the person. Until further orders the amnesty oath will not be administered to paroled officers or soldiers.

MACON, GA., July 11, 1865.

Brigadier General WILLIAM D. WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

Your telegram of yesterday is received. I have given orders necessary about the reception and distribution of the corn for the poor, and have conferred with General Steedman in regard thereto. It will be impossible to carry out your instructions to take receipts payable in the growing crops, as there are but very little crops growing in the devastated districts about Atlanta. A better plan will be to take the receipts of the inferior courts of the counties, or of the Governor of the State, and hold the counties or State liable for the amount.

Brevet Major-General.
