HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,Spanish Fort, April 9, 1865. (Received 1 p. m. 17th.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, Washington:

Yesterday afternoon, during a bombardment of Spanish Fort, A. J. Smith's skirmishers were pushed forward and about 6 p. m. gained a lodgment on the left of the enemy's main line. They were re-enforced during the night, and at midnight the whole work was in our possession. The number of prisoners is about 600. The balance of the garrison it is supposed have escaped by boats; about thirty pieces of artillery captured.

Admiral THATCHER:

(Care of General Bailey.)

The American flag has been waving for more than two hours over the water battery on Spanish Fort, but I shall cause it to be hoisted at once at the highest point, viz, Fort Alexis. As soon as I know the result for certain I will advise you. I think it is somewhere in the neighborhood of 15 to 20 guns and 1,600 to 2,000 prisoners.

E. R. S. CANBY,

Major-General.

FLAG-SHIP STOCKDALE,

April 9, 1865 - 3 a. m.

General CANBY:

I was already in possession of the fact that the Spanish Fort and Alexis had surrendered, but nit the less obligate to you for the information, and had already given orders not to fire. We have found twelve huge torpedoes to-night, between present monitor anchorage and the spot selected for anchorage to-morrow, one mile and a half higher up. Hope to communicate with you in the morning. So soon as you hoist our American flag on the fort we shall salute it.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully,

H. K. THATCHER,

Acting Rear-Admiral.
