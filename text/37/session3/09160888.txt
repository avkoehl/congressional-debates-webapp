LOUISIANA CONGRESSIONAL ELECTION.
Mr. DAWES. I hope that the House will now
proceed to the consideration of the Louisiana con-
gressional election cases.
Mr. STEVENS. 1 have no objection, if the
gentleman will move to postpone their further con-
sideration.
Mr. DAWES. I could not move to postpone,
as I have not the floor to do so. The House really
expected fo take up the Louisiana congressional
election cases when it had finished the District of
Columbia business.
Mr. STEVENS. I move that the rules be sus-
pended, and the House resolve itselfinto the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union, to
consider the Navy appropriation bill.
Mr. BIDDLE. I ask my colleague to yield to
me to offer a resolution of inquiry.
Objection was made.
Mr. WASHBURNE. If the gentleman from
Pennsylvania will yield to me, I will move to
postpone these election cases until Monday next.
Mr. STEVENS. I will agree to that.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ken-
tucky has the floor. Does the gentleman yield to
that motion ?
Mr. MENZIES. I am willing to yield to that
motion.
Mr. DAWES. Let us have an understanding
about this matter. I want to know whether the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Stevens] de-
sires to press the appropriation bills before the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union?
Mr. STEVENS. We are so far back that I am
afraid we will not get through with the bill unless
we go into Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union to-day. We can dispose of them in
a short time.
Mr. DAWES. How soon?
Mr. STEVENS. We can finish them this
week.
Mr. DAWES. I do not want the postpone-
ment to be beyond Monday next. If the condi-
tion of the business of the House is very pressing,
the cases can go over to be taken up at any time.
Mr. WASHBURNE moved to postpone the
election cases till Monday next.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I rise to a question of
privilege. I have some remarks before me
The SPEAKER. State the nature of your
privileged question.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I propose to quote the
remarks of the gentleman from Pennsylvania as
he spoke them. He said that he did not believe
that there could be raised by the United States
fifty thousand volunteers, and that drafted men
were out of the question.
The SPEAKER. Nothing in regard to the
debates of the House have been considered as a
question of privilege.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I only wanted to show
what he did say.
The SPEAKER. It can be done by unanimous
consent.
Mr. WICKLIFFE. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House.
Objection was made.
NAVY APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. STEVENS moved that the rules be sus-
pended,and the House resolve itselfinto the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly resolved itselfinto the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
Mr. McKnight in the chair.
The CHAIRMAN. The first business in order
is the Navy appropriation bill. The pending
amendment, submitted by the gentleman from
Maryland, [Mr. Calvert,] is as follows:
Provided, That no portion of the money appropriated by
this act shall be used for the pay and support of the seventy-
â six midshipmen illegally appointed by the Secretary of the
Navy, and that the said midshipmen be discharged from the
Acadcmy.
The gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Mc-
Pherson] moved the following substitute for the
amendmentof thegentleman from Maryland, [Mr.
Calvert:]
Provided, That the acting midshipmen appointed by the
Secretary of the Navy during the late jecess of Congress,
and named In the executive document No. 6, House of Re-
presontativeÂ«, third session, Thirty-Seventh Congress, shall
be at oncc discharged from the Naval Academy; and no
part of the money hereby appropriated shall be applied to
the payment of any of the expenses of said cadets after the
passage of this act.
The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Lovejoy] is
entitled to the floor.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I have not much to say on
these amendments, Mr. Chairman, and wish
mainly to state what I understand to be the facts
in the case. The debate the other day seemed to
go on the presumption that we had not been al-
lowed to make the recommendation that the law
entitled us to makeforthe Naval Academy. Now,
I understand that each member has his appoint-
ments, if he chooses to make them, as prescribed
by law. Then the question came up, whether,
under the present circumstances of the country,
when we needed all of the educated men of our
land in the naval and land service, there should
be additional pupils appointed for this school by
the Executive, or whether there should be none
at all? The question was not who should appoint
them, but whether they should be appointed? The
rebel States had not made their appointments
The school could be carried on with the whole
number as well as it could with only a pru t; that
is, the expenses would not be increased whether
tho school was only half full or entirely full.
That being the fact, the Executive proceeded to
fit! the school.
