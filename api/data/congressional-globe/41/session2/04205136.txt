INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL.
The SPEAKER. The hour of half past one
having arrived, the gentleman from Wisconsin
[Mr. Raise] is entitled to the floor on behalf
of the Committee of Elections. But the Chair
will state that the Indian appropriation bill has
been returned from the Senate with a request
for a further conference, the conferees hereto-
fore appointed on the part of the two Houses
having entirely failed to come to an agreement.
The gentleman from California [Mr. Sargent]
desires to present the report of the committee
of conference.
The Clerk read as follows:
The committee of conference on the disagreeing
votes of tho two Houses on the amendments to tho
bill (H. R. No. 1169) making appropriations for the
current and contingent expenses of the Indian de-
partment, and for fulfilling treaty stipulations with
various Indian tribes, for the year ending June .30,
1S7J, having met, after full and free conference have
been unable to agreo. â„¢-

Managers on the part of the Senate.
Mr. SARGENT. I desire to briefly state
the grounds of disagreement between the Sen-
ate and House conferees. The Senate con-
ierees insisted upon specific appropriations
under the treaties made since July, 18G7, and
that these be recognized as the supreme law
of the land. They contended that the Senate
had the exclusive right to determine the pro-
priety of making a treaty, the terms of such
treaty, and with whom it might properly be
made, and its action was not open to the criti-
cism or control of the legislative power. They
offered, however, to put a clause in the bill
authorizing the President to use the money for
any other purposes than those named in the
treaties, in his discretion, but with the consent
of the Indians.
The House conferees refused to insert into
the bill anything which could be taken as a
ratification or consent to any Indian treaty
made since July 20, 1867; contending that the
roving, irresponsible bands of Indians on our
own toil, subject to our own jurisdiction, are
not independent nations with whom treaties
can properly be made; that the practice of so
regarding and treating them had been fruitful
of frauds on the Government and injurious to
the Indians; that the new treaties for which
the House had steadily refused appropriations
involve an expenditure of $70,000,000 at least,
and to concede the demand of the Senate con-
ferees would be to admit that that sum, and
any amount whatever, could be taken from tha
Treasury without the consent of the people's
Representatives, cither as to the amount or the
use to which it should be applied; that the
objects for which the money was to be used
under the treaties, were, in a great measure,
fantastic and useless; that the recent Indian
delegations had denounced these treaties as a
fraud and surprise on the Indians; and the
Government had paid no respect to them, so
far as they conferred or confirmed hunting
privileges on or to the Indians.
Finding themselves so far from accord with
the Senate conferees, the House conferees, as
a last hope of agreement, and desirous that the
Indian service might go on, the comfort and
civilization of the Indians be secured, and the
borders be saved from the horrors of an Indian
war, proposed to appropriate the full amount
which the Senate had inserted in the bill by
way of amendments, appropriating to each
tribe, or confederation of tribes, the amount
named by the Senate, in a gross sum, without
naming the objects for which it should be ex-
pended, except in general terms, and leave to
the Executive the duty and responsibility of
expending the money to the best advantage of
the Indians and the service. If he saw fit to
use it to furnish the Indians the specific arti-
cles stipulated in the treaties, to take those
treaties as a guide in the expenditure, he could
do so. If he thought the welfare and content-
ment of the Indians would be otherwise better
promoted he could act accordingly. With this
view we proposed, as a compromise, to take
the text of the House bill in relation to each
tribe, which text is as follows:
For this amount, to be expended in such goods,
provisions, and other articles as the President may
from time to time determine, including insurance
and transportation thereof, in instructing in agri-
