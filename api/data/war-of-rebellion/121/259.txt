Since the 25th of November, 1864:

7 colonels, equivalent to............................. 105

7 lieutenant-colonels, equivalent to.................. 70

8 majors, equivalent to............................... 64

79 captains, equivalent to............................ 474

158 lieutenants, equivalent to........................ 632

1,052 non-commissioned officers, equivalent to........ 2,104

4,694 privates, equivalent to......................... 4,694

------

Total................................................. 9,652

I would respectfully suggest that an understanding be had with Mr. Ould by which deliveries to the 7th of February, 1865, covering the number of officers and men given above, reduced to privates, may be declared exchanged. Colonel Mulford will be able to say at what date he had delivered an equal number of rebel prisoners, and upon this basis Mr. Ould can make an equivalent declaration, or, if it is thought advisable, the declaration may be charged against the 32,000 prisoners due us on declarations already declared by Mr. Ould.

Unless the paroled prisoners now being received are declared exchanged from time to time it will not be possible to provide for them at the three parole camps.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Bvt. Brigadier General, U. S. Army, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 18, 1865.

Brigadier General J. BARNES,

Commanding District of Saint Mary's, Point Lookout, Md.:

GENERAL: The prisoners of war who are to be forwarded for exchange from the West will be ordered to Point Lookout, but if transportation can be furnished at Baltimore some of them will probably be sent direct to City Point. Those who are landed at Point Lookout will not be taken upon your rolls, but will be held in readiness to be forwarded whenever called for by Colonel Mulford. A memorandum of all such arrivals and departures should be kept so that a full account of them can be given in figures. The guards which accompany them will return immediately to their posts from Point Lookout.

Prisoners who have been in close confinement or in irons have also been ordered to Point Lookout, to be forwarded for special exchange for the same class of prisoners. There will probably not be many. Keep them together and forward them by the first opportunity.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Bvt. Brigadier General, U. S. Army, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

WASHINGTON, D. C., February 18, 1865.

Colonel T. INGRAHAM,

Pro. March General, Defenses North of the Potomac, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: By direction of Lieutenant-General Grant, commanding U. S. Army, approved by the Secretary of War, you will forward all rebel prisoners who are now or who have been in close confinement or in irons at the Old Capitol Prison to Point Lookout for special exchange.
