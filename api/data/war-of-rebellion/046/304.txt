ber, 12 men are required to carry the stuff an average distance of 200 yards to the rendezvous, 4 men to saw and sharpen it, and 4 men to make the panels and pile them up. This squad will make, if tasked, sixty per day, which equals two and a half per man employed. They require for this work five felling axes, two hammer hatchets, and a large cross-cut saw. One hundred and seventy-five to 200 pounds of 5 or 6 inch spikes will be used for every 100 panels made.

Four men can handle a frame readily, even when the stuff is green and water-soaked. Six panels made a load for a four-house team. Two hundred men carried 100 panels 300 yards, dug the trench, and set them in three hours. Seventy-five men carried 40 panels 100 yards, dug the trench, and set them in fifty minutes. Sixty men carried 60 panels 50 yards, dug the trench, and set them in one and a half hours.

When made of split stuff, the palisading was much stronger with the bark side placed up, or from the enemy.

Toward the latter part of the siege, this obstacle showed considerable injury from the enemy's shot. Repairs were made by placing abatis in the openings thus formed.

NOTE Numbers 2.

WIRE ENTANGLEMENT. (See Map, Plate III.*)

This obstacle was made by setting stout stakes, 3 1/2 feet long, 2 feet in the ground and 7 feet apart, in quincunx order, and in three lines. Around the top of these stakes, at from 12 to 18 inches from the ground, in notches prepared to receive it, Numbers 12 wire was securely and tightly wound, and extended from one to the other.
