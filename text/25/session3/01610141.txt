with a resolution of the Senate of the 20th of De-
cembei last, piesenting a comparative view of the
quantity of gold coins now in the United States,
with the circulation of the late Bank of the United
States
Mr BENTON observed that, on looking at
this document, he found that the quantity of gold
How in the counta y was greater than the circula
tion of the United States Bank, even in the times
of its greatest expansion It was important that
the facts showed in this report should be exten-
sively known through the country, and for this
purpose he would move for the punting of five
thousand extra copies
This motion was agreed to

zen of the United States, on the subject of the
cultuie of the beet loot The memoual (Mr

tific pioduction, and the author had been favor-
ably spoken of by Mi Ellsworth, the Commis-
sionei of the Patent Office, u ider whom he held
an official station, as a gentleman of talents and
learning From a cuisory glance Mr L had
given to the memorial, he had no doubt but that
every woid of it was tiue
Mi L then presented the memoual, which
was refeircd to the Committee on Agriculture,
and ordered to be printed
Mr DAVIS observed that he had had an op-
portunity of leading the document that had just

As these islands progress in civilization, their demand ior
the produce ot more northern climates will increase Ivor
can any country supply them with beef, flour, &c , on terms
so advantageous as this A very successful effort has been
recently made at the Sandwich Islands in the cultivation
of cotfee and the sug ir cane A colony here will, m time
thence easily derive these articles and other tropical prod
ucts in exchange for the produce of their own labor We
have thus briefly alluded to the natural resources of the
country, and to its external relations They are, m our
opinion, stiong inducements for the Government of the Um
ted States to t ike lormal and speedy possession We urge
this step as promising to the general uueiests of the nation
But the advantages it may confer upon us, and the evils it
may avert from our posterity, are incalculable
Our social intercourse has thus far been prosecuted with
reference to feelings of honor, to the feeling of dependence
on the Hudson's Bay Compan}, and to their moral mflu
ence Under this state ot things, we have thus far pros
pered, but we cannot hope that it will continue The agn
cultural and other resources of the country cannot fail to
induce emigration and commerce As our settlement begins
to draw its supplies through other channels, the feeling of
dependence upon the Hudson's Bay Company, to which we
have alluded as one of the safeguards ot our social inter
couise will begin to diminish We are anxious when we
imagine what will be, what must be, the condition of so
mixed a community, free from alt leg il restraint, and supe
nor to that moral influence which has hitherto been the
plidge of our safety
Our interests are identified with those of the country of
oui adoption     We flatter ourselves that we are the germ
of a great State and are anxious to give an early tone to
the moral and intellectual character of its citizens    We
are iullv aware, too, that the destinies of our posterit} will
be intimately affected by the character of those who eim
grate to the country    The territory must populate    The
Congiess of the United fctatea must say by whom     Ihe
natural resources oí the country, with a well judged civil
code will invite a good commumf}     But a good eomrnu
nity will hardlv emigrate to a country which promises no
protection for life or property   Inquiries have already been
submitted to some of us for information of the country
In return, we can only speak oí a country highly favored
of nature    We can boast of no civil code    We can prom
ise no protection but the ulterior resort of self defense    By
whom, then, shall our countr} be populated > üy the icck

Our lutercouise with the n mves among us guidi d much

ourselves, has been general!} pacific But the saint causes
which will inunupt haimonv ainon¿ ourselves will also
interrupt our friendly relations with the natives It is,
therefore, of primary importance, both to them and us that
the Government should take energetic measures to secure
the execution of all 1 iws affecting Indian trade and the in
u rcourse of white men and Indians We have thus briefly
shown that the security of our persons and our property,
the hopes and destinies of our children are involved m the

from Wisconsin to propose the reference of the

evei, occurred to him, that, as the sublet was of

upon the river Embarrass, which wag not sec-
tionized when the other public lands in that part
of the State were surveyed, in consequence of
being inundated and diowned, and in which sit-
uation it still remains Mr R. said, in present-
ing the resolution, he considered it proper to state,
in hopes of a favorable consideration of the sub-
ject, that this township, not having been surveyed
was in consequence of its inundation and sup-
posed wonhlessness, that thesurveys in thatpart
of the State were made many years ago, and bad
been in maiket upwards of twenty years, much
of them were yet unsold, that tins township, as
it now is, and most probably will continue to be,
is uttei ly valueless to the Government The State,
however, by diaming, may be able to convert it
to some useful purpose, and, at the same time,
greatly improve the health of the neighborhood
in which it is situate With its avails it is pro-
posed to improve the navigation of the river upon
which it lies—a uver aireadv navigable foi a short
distance, and capable oí being made so some hun-
dred or more of miles—the uppei part of which
runs thiough an interior and veiy ieitile portion

and aiding to diam the swamps and inundated
lands upon many of the river bottoms in Illinois,
as that subject, m a specific form, had been al-
ready brought to the notice of the Senate, and
upon which he hoped soon to see the liberal action
of Congress, which he felt assured could be had
greatly to the benefit and interest of all concerned,
and without the expense of a dollar to Govern-
ment, by a donation of tht lands to be reclaimed
