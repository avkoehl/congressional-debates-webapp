]831, was violated by the refusal of the French
Cna libers to comply with it' and  was not that
violation just cause of war'   Is it upon this argu-
ment further forbearance is demanded—forbear
a ice beyond the prefer t session'
Does it occur to gentlemen here timt it will cost
France just as much to go to war for these five
millior s as it wi 1 cost us' If war shou'd be the
re«ul* of the couise which we may be compelled
to ta^e, is the fault ours' Had Trance complied
with the stipulationsof the treaty, that friendship,
which is so highly and so jus ly appieciated,
might, and would, have been preserved—had she
been as tender of our feelings, a id regardful of
our rights, as we have been of hers, no difficulty
could ever have occurred between us But forge
tin" that sacred friendship—thatanoientall anee—
■which weigns so heavily with us—she h s delayed
to acknowledae a ¡ust debt for more than twenty
yeais, and, after icknowledging and promising,
in the most solemn manne-, to nay it, she has
finally refused, and "till continues to enjoy the
commeicial benefi s of the treaty, winch were
given as pait consideration iot the five millions
she promised to pay
It wou'd, to be sure, be better, in a pecuniary
point of view, that we should pay our cit zens the
five mil ions of dollars thin to hazaid a war with
France, if thct weie the only interest involved
But can  we thus comptomise the honor of the
nu ion '    Is the na iom I honor to be estimated by
dolíais and cents'   To submit to this indignity, |
would be an anand mment of all national chai de-
ter, and invite aggiession and insult fiom every !
other quarter     The idea is not to be tolerated for
a moment     1 am willing to wait as 'ongas we can I
with piopnetj , for further adv ces from Fiance,
but not so long as to prevent decisive aenon on
the ques ion at the present session     We 1 ave
ample to irds to justify the proceeding recom   |

j isti?e, o/ei ai d over again pioposed by himself
ui <l admitted t > be due to this country, and atiei
fiur months of the session, for it is mw the fourth
month since the special call of the Fiench Cham
lerof Deputies was made, with reference to the
adjustment of this veiy claim   heie we are, with
whu intelligence fiom Fiance'    Why, that your
minister was first seduced into the b lief or assuied
into the beli-f, by the (1 wishes of Louis I hilippe
a i J his Cabinet, that they i eally intended to e-itei
heart and soul, into this measure, and instantly
carry the  treaty into effect—that they meant to
pledge the whole weight of the Government, and
to throw themselves into the scale, and make it a
national proposition      This was the purport of
Mr Livingston's fiist despatch   But what wasthe
amountof hissubsequertcorrespondence ' Why,
he grows less and less sangun e up to the da e of
his last communication, and final'y tells us he is
now not at all sanguine'    That the French King
and his Cabinet, instead of making it a ministerial
measure, and throwingthe whole weight and pop-
ularity of the Government into the scale, have
shuffled out of the controversy, and left it as an
open matter, in the decision of which they have
no special interest     Now, let me ai-k the members
of this House what pledge they will wait for after
this shuffling course, before the close nf this sessioi'
Can they, after this, expect to receive intelligence
of a more grateful character'    Or may they not
leasonably calculate upon hearing, by the first ves   |
sel tnat may arnve fiom Europe, that this nation,
which has thus long procrastinated the payment of j
a just claim, has determined  not to pay it at all' |
And having come to that conclusion, and knowing
that wai is inevitable, may we not expect her to |
take the fiist step, and, as a mattei of safety to I
herself, detain ourships now in theMediteiiaiiean, j
ar d bloeksde the ports there '    We'l, whataie we [
s«l;ed  to do by the piooo itinn of the honorable
memberfom Massachusetts   Nothing moiethan i
that, in the event of their  refusing   befoie  the <
adjournment of this House, to ratify tins treaty, I
the House will pledge itself to answer the call of j
the President of the Uní ed States, by giving bin
powpr, or resorting to some othei   means, m the
event of this contingency, to save the nation and

I     Mr SUIHLRLINDex, ress«d his app.oba
tion of the exalted and patriotic sentiment ex-
pressed by the gentleman from Massachusetts,
[Mi Adams,] but he confessed, in the present
instance, he could not go with him to the extent
which his remarks seemed to indicate Give me
(said Mr S ) the vantage ground, and all the
advantage which long suffering and forbearanca
can give in such a contest as this But (he asked)
shall we gain this giound bv precipitation' Shall
we not rather injuie a just and honest cause' Let
us hear once moie fiom France, for she is, after
all,our ancient friend and ally He still cherished
the hope, that on the receipt of the President's
message, she would be inclined to render us jus-
tice Ten or fifteen days at the uttermost would
bring us intelligence from that country, and he
fervently hoped with it a message worthy of
Fiance If these sanguine anticipations should
not be realized, lie would then be prepared to go
with the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr
Advms,] and from Ohio, [Mr Lytle,] to main-
tain the honor and glory of our country, as far as
they could go We " asked nothing but what is
right, and would submit to nothing wrong " He
would give Fiance the opportunity, at least, of
sending us better tidings It would be painful
to wage a war with Fiance, but she, like oth#r
nations, must rendei us justice—strict, equal, and
exact jus ice He would give her a last chance
of settling her affairs with us on amicable terms
fits feelings were such, that he was willing logo
back to ancie it times, and remember with gloiv-
lng giatitude the foimei relations between that
G vernment and our own If we now say we
w II not go to war with her in consequence of our
recollections of these ancient services, will it not
excite a corresponding spirit on her part He
was disposed t> look on that countiy as one
which had rendeied us essential service in the
hour of oui gieatest want of such seivice He
believed tlxat i week befoie the closing of the res-
sion wou'd be time enough for the House to take
any decisive measuies for it was evident we were
pre >aied,at a moment's warning, if Fiance should
refine to grant us jus'ice, to go with the gentleman
from Masbachu.se ts, to go with the President ui
asserting and vindicating our rights
Afer same further remaiks, Mr S al'tided to
lour anlity to maintain a conflict with foreign
Piweis We had passed through one war with
hei who had so long been proudly denominated
1 the mistiess of the o ean, in which our heioes
had won for themselves and their country immor al
renown The stai sand stripes of A menea waved
ovei every sea, a protection to our rights, a teiror
to oui fo°s
Mi S sai I he wruld not send these documents
to the Corimi tee on h ireign Rehtions, with the
j neiemp'oiy instructims suggested by the gentle-
I man fiom Mis achusett , [Mi Ada'1s,1 but, in
the languag  of the gentleman from Alabama,
[Vlr McKiNLrv,] he would wilt a few da>s
lie would secu e to oui countiy in her just and
holy cause ill the nd vintage of long suffenng and
patience No vessel had v it arnvtd from France
wh ch sailed foi this country rllei-the transmis-
sion of the Pie ident's message to Cot giess
Wliat new lig ts had we at the present moment
ti guile us'° Surely none He was for waiting
the effect of that message on the Tiench peojjle
It it is disposed then to íetiace their steps vnd do
