Which said motion Mr Underwood hart moved to amend by
adding thereto the following words
lBut, m punting the message and accompanying documents,
this House does not intend to approve or sanction the institution
ofthis commission, it being the opinion of this House that the
President has no ngritful authority to appoint and commission
c fficers to investigate abuses, or to piocure information for the
President to act upon, and to compensate such officers at the
public expense, wuhoutauthorityexpiessly givenbylaw '
Mr CltoHING, who held the floor from Wednesday, resumed
ana concluded his remarks
Mr C said that the proposition before the/ House was only
tenable as a constitutional proposRion, founded on the amend
mentr roposedby the gentleman from Ke/tucky, [Mi Uxvdeb
wood,] who had altered that amenflment^And presented it m a
new lorm to the House, since his filst introduction of it   It was
upon the proposition, in its amended fiprm, that he, therefore
intended to address the Speaker!   The gentleman from Ken
tuckv indicated the impression thst, in /he course of his rerr arks
presented to the House on Wednesday last, he (Mr C > was
taking a technical advantage o| thj proposition  before the
House, and intended to evade thejquástion before them    Now
he (Mi C) would assure thegentletfian fiom Kentucky that he
had no such intention, as it was till determination to meet the
question in all its bearings, and*/ely upon the grounds of us
constitutionality or unoonslitution ity    It was upon this view
of the question he was determined to meet the gentleman from
Kentucky, and not upon the particular  phiaecology of the
proposition   He therefore wished the Clerk to read the pi oposi
tun under discussion
[1 he amendment was here read by the Cleik ]
Mr C continued     The words intiod iced in the commission
'ynu aie authorized to pioceed jointly and seveially in this
omniission,' as well as the words   to compensate by aut 101
Ity given by law," were the mam points at issue between him
(Mi C ) and the gentleman from Kentucky    He (Mi C ) hel!,
how evei, that the quciti nof   compensation ' wab not material
to the issue   but with regaid to the appointment of officers in
this muter, hoeravely put i to the House was it from the | n
vaie pocketot the Presiden of the United States that compel sa

ther oi not the Pi esident had the power to appoint ofbeers to
act under this commission, tomve tigate charges involving the
charaeters of ceitam functionaries connected wi h the G vein
mentí This ques ion mvoived a variety of histoncal precedents
which would be "bund most instructive, and covered the acts ot
the early Pi esidents, fiom the days of George Washington down
tluough all the idmimstiations to the pieicntdiy He (Mi
C) was prenaied lo show whether or not the President ha 1
violated the Constitution and had Ubuiped power In the present
instance In going into this matei, he would appellto the
good sense and honoi of this House whether oi not they ha 1 not
ordeied the lepoit of Mr Pomdexter to be printed and were
thus proceeding in advanie of the caw of the other comma
sioneib an 1 also in advance of the evidence? He appeJed to
the House whether or not ltwouldbe more in aceoidalice wi h
the si nit of fair play and fain tsb m the m liter, to allow all
the case, 11 all ltshearn gs to be first printed and then brought
beloie them for discussion?
Mr C , at this stage of his remarks, submi.tctl apioposition
that the rer ortsand documents, m the order in which they came
from the President, should all be printed in the usual manner,
and that the debate should be continued on the motion to
print an extra number of copies, to which motion the am nl

fjcrutmize, ind, unless this were done, how weietliey to check
the progress of the evill So as regarded the custom-hotis*.
Supposing the collector embezzled the public moneys, ana
that the cashier connived, and supposing that the naval of-
ficer also connived in what way was this series of frauds to
be put downl It availed nothing to write a letter to either til 
collector, cashier, or naval officer How then, was the Secre-
tary of the I reasury to discover the fraudl In the act of 1799,
there was a specific piovision, which empowered them to m.
sti ute investigation As the gentleman from Kentucky mada
this his proposition, it might be well, by way of practical il-
lustration, to call to his muia" the events that had occurred m
this House last Congress
He would appeal to the Whigs ofthis House whether or not
the then Pnsidemof the United States, and the Secretary of
the Treasury, were not charged with a de ehction of duty, for
not having obtained the knowledge of the embezzlements com-
muted by Swaitwout, and arrested their progress? He would
appeal te the gentleman fiom Kentucky, and ask him, when
charges of so senous a character as this wero adduced against
a public functionary underthe Executive, weie the President
and ¡secretary of the Treasury to fold then arms, and allow
this smiles of embezzlements to go on? He would appeal to
every member m this House—he would ask the Whigs, who
now rraintam aposition adverse to the authouty of the Presi-
dent to appoint commissioners m thia case, whether or not, in.
the debates at the period he referred lo, they maintained that
the Pi esident had not the power te appoint and adopt means to
procure information with a view to investigation? But when
they (the Whigs) came into power, they proceeded to execute,
thepuiposes which they professed under the order now indis-
cussion," and which the gentleman from Kentucky now repu-
diated He would ask the gentleman from Kentucky to bear
m mind that, when charges of usuipation by the President
were then brought thtie was signed to the paper "Thomas
Pwing who paiticipated m the act, and was equally respon-
sible f"n it with the then President It was not "Tohn Tylss"
akmrt tl at ought tobe held responsible in this case this alleged
usi ri alum equally fell upen the head of Thomas Ewing aa
the Pn sident
l\n rENDIETON I wish to ask whetlrei the gentleman
fiom M issachusetts intends to convey the idea that Mr Ewmg
issued this commission without the express authority of the
Pi esident?
Mr CUSII^G Certainly not, but there was a joint and
concuirent responsibility Theiewasan equal responsibility
on die one as well as the other But why put the name of the
President exclusively to this order? They acted in this respect
con rary to the facts The document he held in his hand would
show that before the death of Mi Haruson, he himself bad set
the precedent lor the issuing of which commission they were
now impeaching John Tyler They had impeached the actof
Gen Han soniitltjll with regard lo ihe commission on the
I ublicbui (ling  There was no distinction between this and
the case of the Now \ ork custom house The part of Tyler, m
the latter case, was exactly the same as that of Harrison in the
frruercase wihregaid to the rublic buildings Both had
acted under constitutional authority He would not be under-
stood to i npiiteany thing deiogatoiy to Gen Harrison, but ha
contended that both these cat.es were the same m principle.
[Mr C heie lead at length the instructions given to the corn-
il issionersm the case of the New Yo'k custom house, and pro-
ceeded I These were matters all to be ascertained upon inves-
«oation but the gentleman from Kentucky maintained, when
he la t addressed th  House, that these matters ought to be
I uoivn to the President by general knowledge, when he came
u to ffice How could ihese matters be known otherwise than
by investigation1 It was evident that there was something in
ihe Con titution which gave the power, m this case, to the Fres-
rlent toarrest the evil, for, if not, they were reduced to this
pi actical absuidity—that there existed no means under the Con-
stitution, to aircst fraud
If theie existed no such power, both Harrison and Tyler, and
c\ cry Ptosident since the first foimation of the Constitution,
commit ed this usurpation of power such a proposition as
the picsent v, as never before affirmed—that the President had no
iu honty lo appoint an investigation, but was to be depiived of
the mean-, of pleadrng t ihis fnnrtrons on this spot and was to
be dennv, d of all mei is of obtaining information on charges of
a serious public cha-auer This was not the Constitution , it
coulu otb that this could have gone on for fifty years unde
lt Mi cy a Uiesse 1 himself to the Whig members of thiaHouse,
wl by their i lolessed d^ire to expose the abuses in the ad
rain b ia ion ofthis Government, he considered committed to
the auth rrty of he investigation He now appealed to the
o lie si lo of the House—to tho a who had supported Jackson
and Vm Bu en-and asked them whether they meant to charge
Andrew Jackson and Martin Van Buren with reiterated viola-
tions ol the Constitution in this respect, because lie was pre-
na cd to show that both of them habitually exeicised this power
