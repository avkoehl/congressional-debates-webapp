Captain Weller, in command of the Twenty-fourth Ohio, fell at his post on the last battle-field, and left Captain Cockerill in command who, bravely and skillfully performed his whole duty; and as much as much may be said of Captain Woodward, who succeeded to the command of the Thirty-sixth Indiana upon the fall of Major Kinley at a critical and perilous moment in the first day's engagement.

I am under lasting obligations to my staff and orderlies for their efficient assistance during these several days' fighting. Captain Peden, Thirty-sixth Indiana, is entitled, to great credit for his aid rendered me up to the time he fell, wounded, on the 31st.

Lieutenant J. P. Duke, of the Twenty-third Kentucky, also on my staff, deserves a high meed of praise for these engagements. Dr. Silas H. Kersey, acting brigade surgeon, with unsurpassed, industry and skill, has rendered invaluable assistance to the wounded.

My mounted orderlies, Frank Brough, Frank Webb, Albert Woods, William D. Smith, Martin Mann, and Louis Miller of the Second Indiana Cavalry, George Shirk and Isaac Biglow, of the Thirty-sixth Indiana Infantry, rendered me valuable service. But I am left to remember and lament with friends the fall, in this mighty struggle for human prowess, of such brave spirits as Colonel Jones, Major Terry, Captains Weller, Shultz, King, Adjutant Williams, Lieutenants Foster, Ball, Abercrombie, and others, whose earthly conflicts have closed with these battles I may truthfully add that I mourn with those who mourn over these irreparable losses.

To the brave wounded, whose fate may or may not be uncertain, you have my earnest prayers for a speedy restoration to health and usefulness.
