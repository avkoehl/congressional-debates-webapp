Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military DIVISION of the Mississippi:

We marched to this place by two good roads from Cave Spring. All nicely encamped. Hood took much, but there is plenty of corn and some pigs. My trains from Rome arrived in Vann's Valley Post-Office all right. Some of the enemy's cavalry, scouting and observing parties, hover about us.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
