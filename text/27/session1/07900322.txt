IJulús and Drawbacks—Mr. Campbell.
H. of Reps
they have become indebted they have become so
fot objects within their own limits, with which you
have nothing to do, and are competent 'o provide
for them from their own resources It is an insult
to the intelligence of the people lo suppose that they
*an be deceived by a measure which distributes
money with one hand, when you immediately pl&ce
th" other in their pockets to abstract a laiger
«mount. Do you suppose that a measure which
proposes to distribute a portion of the public reve
nue, upon the basis of federal numbers, during an
acknowledged deficiency in theTreasury.can be well
received in that section ol the country where, wi h
less than a third of its federal population, more
than two-thirds of the exports of the domestic pro-
ducts of the whole Union are produced, par ícular-
ly in those Slates where the people believe that,
under a system of impost duties, they pay more
than an equal proportion mto the Fedeial Trea-
sury}
Taxes are necessary to the support of Govern-
ment, and when laid for that object, and appro-
priated to that purpose, will be cheerfully paid by
the people. But to distribute a portion ot the pub-
lic revenue among the States, .and thus increase a
deficiency m the Treasury, to be supplied by taxa-
tion, is unequal, unjusi, and oppressive We ap-
peal from your decís on upon ibis subject, to the
ballot-box, there we vill tarry (hi question at ihe
next elections, and relying upon the julice of our
cause and the intelligence of ihe peop'e, we feel
confident of victory
Something had been said on the intricate quesiion
of where the burden of taxation chiefly falls by
duties on lmpoilations Mr. C believed that he
was the first pet t n wl o ever, on i^e fl >rr of Con
gress, advanced the proposition that a duty upon
imports operated as a tax upon exports He bad
made this point in a <p°ech delivered by him in
the 21st Congress, 0n the 13 h of March, 1830,
some weeks before Mr McDuffie's eel brateeí
speech, in wh ch the same doc nine v¡ as advanced
and which had since become s0 celebrated under
the name of the forty bale iiieory Mr C -Undid
to this subject at this time for the purpose of more
fully explaining his views upon it, but before do
mg so, would read lh° following extract from his
own speech "Gentleme.1 may say that a tax upon
imports is a tax exclusively upon the consumer,
tba( consumption, for the most part, is, proportion-
ed to population, and therefore that the burdens of
the tariff are equalized Sir, I admit that ihe bur
dw« of the sys em are felt by all, but 1 deny that
they are in an equal degree There is ,,ot in Ihe
science of political economy a proportion more
susceptible of demonstration, than tint a tax upon
importations operates indirectly as a tax upon cx-
porlations Some ot the S'ates export to a greater
extent than others, and thus it is that ihe tariff ope
rates unequally A single example w 11 illustiate
the proposition. We will suppose that 10 lbs of
cotton would purchase one yaid of woollen cl th,
add 50 per cent on the yard of woollen cloth for
duty, and n will reqn.re 15 lbs. of cotton to pui-
chase it "                                                       f
Now, sir, vaul Mr C. although it is a monos-
tion of universal applicalie n, that the more we re
ceive of the productions ot otta-r countries, the
more of ouis they are enabled io lake m excharge,
yu, in a large mijonty of ca fs   duties upon im'
portations do not fall exclusively upon exporta
tions, but are divided Letuetn the prod cer oí the
exports, the consumer, and  ihe foieign manufac-
turer or producrofihe artic'es imperito"   The bur
den falls upon iheexpi rt< r to theextent Unt the duiy
checks consumption, and diminishes ihe foreign de-
mand for his art c e beyond the m-irket that it ere
ates at home   ft falls upon the consumer to the ex
tent that it raises the price of the amclp consume!,
and tt falls, upon ihe producer or manufacturer of ihe
artic e imported, to in  ex ent that it check  its con
sumption and throws difficulties m the way of ex
f hanoe.   Exc  sive duties also frequently prcduce
injudicious and excessive co-npctition among do
mesne producers or manufacturer , and thus ttn 1
to the  injury   of those they   were designed to
benefit
Butif duties upon importations operate even to a
Jtmited extent as a tax upon exportation, (as all
must admit that they do,) is it not obvious that duties
which are unnecessarily high, are, in effect, a Vio-
lation of that provision of tbc Constitution which
prescribes that "no duty shall be laid on the ex-
ports of any Sta'e "
I cannot say that I entertain great objections to
the principles of the present bill, for, although it
exempts from duly certain articles that are used m
domestic manufactures, and thus may be con-
sidered to make a discrimination in their favor,
the principle of protection is not further recog-
nised than may b* fairly considered as provided
for by the act of 1833, commonly called the com-
promise act—an act to wmch ihe State that I have
the honor, in part, to repres*nt, assen ed, and
which brought peace to her ihen distracted coun-
sels How far it may be found practicable to
carry out the prmciple of home valuation, pro-
vided for in that act, consistently with that provi
sion cf ihe Constitution which presences a uni-
formity of duUes in all our pons, it is not ncces
s<iry now to discuss "Sulhcient unto the day is the
ev 1 thereof "
I find upon this occasion a bill presen'ed to my
consideration, based upon revenue principles,
which, if it becomes a law, will operate with as
much equality throughout the Union as almest
any tariff that can be devised and which, upon its
face, is not violative of the principles of the com-
promise act But while in eandoi I mike these
admissions, I will ask gentlemen whether they re-
gard it to bi in accordance to the spirit of ibe
compromise act, which provides that no more mo-
ney ihall be raised from customs than shall be
found necessary for em economical administration
of the Goternmtnl, lo distribute a portion of
the public revenue among the State*, that the
anticipated deficiency thereby, in part, created
may be supplied by a tax upon our foreign com'
meice"! The passage of tins bill would probably
a considerable it fluence in promoting the passage
of UieLindDi tribntun bill thiouji the SCrate)

of a nat onal debt, which wül heieaficr afford the
irresistible argument of necessity for heavy duties
upon our importat ons?

I acknowledge thit the tariff mnst soon be re
vise!, ror I do not believe lhat even with the pro-
ceeds of the public lands, the existing tar ff will
be found sufficient, with ut a great increase
of importations, to meet ihe warns of the
Government, and th~ longer the revision is
postponed, the larger will be the accumulation of
debl, and the gr-atcr necessity willtaeie be for
the mpositioi of high dunes But ihe regular sPS

I heard a gentleman I rom Maryland, [Mr Kev
nedy,] a day or tv7o sinoe, speak of free trade as
an ignis fatuus The beneficial influence of free
irada has been well illustrated in the increase of
our commerce with Prance vlnce ihe reduction in
the dunes ot her wines and silks, for whtch she
pays for oar cotton, tobacco, and other exports I
am aware that the tobacco planters, some of whom
are no doubt repiesented by that gentleman, com
plain loudly o' the heavy duly to which their
aiticle is subject in France, and m some cf the
conventions recently held in relation io that trade,
have htn ed at the propriety of retaliatory or coun-
tervailing duties being imposed On French silks
and wines. Such mjudtc ous legislation would be
prejudicial to our whole commerce wi h Prancf,
but less so perhaps to ihe producers of cotton than
of Any other artic e of export For, if by laying
a heavy countervailing duty on French silks, we
increase their price t> such an extent as to lender
th^m too expensive as a common dress for our
ladies, a beam ful and graceful substitute will be
found in French lawn , cambric, and muslins,
fanufac'ured, in part, of our cotton And thus,
although obstacles, to some exlent, would be
thrown in ihe way of our trade, the consumption
of that article might be increased But on the to-
bacco planter, if unsuccessful in the d n;ercus le-
gislative experiment which he rece inrrem's, of
compelling other nations by countervai me du íe.
to r-linqutsh their restric ive policy, the blow
would fall with unmitigated force, anil he wou'd
find himself m the ur comfortable condition, not
only of being compelled to pay a heavy toll upon
his article when it reached the fi re gn marke', but
also ot paying an incre«. el till upon the con-
modiiy lhat he received in exchange, upon its am
val in this coui try.
The cotton manufacture of Frunce ts one of her
most flourishing branches of industry A large
portion of the raw material is supplied from this
country, and I hope that we will not,by injudicious
legislation, make it her interest to look at an eaily
day to her lecent Afr can aiquisituns, or to any
other quarter, for a supply
S nee ihe commencement of this se«si n, I have
also heard the corn laws of England alluded to by a
Representative of í grain-growing Sta e of  the
Wis!, as cause for the adoption of  ccuuttrvailirg
duties  in rclaiim to the productions ot   ih-itcoun-
tiy      What are the corn laws of Greit Britain   to
the giain growers of ihe VVesi?    Corn  wheal, «ni
oils, ti e only grains pr eluecd   in   the We t,  sire
heavy of transportation and sulj°ct lo  gieat lrju-
rv from a long water pas age     It ihe corn laws of
Enslmd were rep aled, her markets wtuld  be im-
mediately seized upon by the producers of rite m
the Southern S ates, and the p oducers of grain on
the continent ot  Europe, pud the  farmers of  the
Northwestern Sta'e* wou d pro1 ably be in a great
meisure deprived of the oppcrlunity of li rmsbing
England even with the hunted supply which they
now do through her possessions in Cinara.   There
is, however, more ihan ore interestm this country
upon whose prosperity the repeal or modihc?ttcn
of th  English corn laws would have an important
influence    The efftct of such a measure would
bo to cheapen the price of provisions in England,
increase  the coniu npuon of American cotton by
giving  a new inpulse  to her uianufac ores, and
make them more fo mi lable competitors than they
are, even now, ofour e wn
I regielted to hear a gen leman from Ohio, [Mr
Stohly] attheHt meeting of this House, de
c'ai himself in favorof a pro cctivi tariff, in other
words, the advocóte ot unequal lavs f he inte-
rests of the West and the £>< uth arc, m my estima-

Southern section of the United Sut s feunishe., an
important and constant market for ihe surplus
grain of the West, which is nrst used m th  raising
and fit enug of stock, thit is afterwards converted
in o bacon and sent to New Orlean?, whence it is
shipped to other Southern por sfor consumpti >n, or
