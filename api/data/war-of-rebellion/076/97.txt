HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY,July 9, 1864.

Colonel W. W. LOWE,

Cartersville, Ga.:

General Thomas says keep the party at work under guard of dismounted men.* Why did Major Wolfley capture guerrillas? There is another way of treating them. His energy in pursuit and capture of rebel soldiers is commendable.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee, July 9, 1864.

Colonel LOWE,

Cartersville:

That is very well, but why is the telegraph interrupted beyond Dalton? I now have a division across the Chattahoochee, and except to have four by night, with two separate bridges and fords. Don't spare the rascals at work to destroy our road. I approve the severest measures.+

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

CARTERSVILLE, July 9, 1864.

Colonel E. H. MURRAY:

General Sherman says that's very well. Take no prisoners if it can be avoided. When it is evident they are railroad destroyers, he will approve the severest measures. Part of our army is across the Chattahoochee.

W. W. LOWE,

Colonel, Commanding.

CARTERSVILLE, July 9, 1864.

Major-General STEEDMAN:

I am informed by General Sherman that Colonel Garrard is on the way to the front with a brigade of cavalry. The general directs me to take command of any and all cavalry on the way to the front to enable [me] to clear the country of rebels. I have something in view for Colonel Garrard. Will you be kind enough to tell me how I can communicate with him most readily. We captured over 40 of the railroad destroyers yesterday; think I will get some more to-day.

W. W. LOWE,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry Division, Dept. of the Cumberland.

JULY 9, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

General Garrard is across at Roswell, and Dodge is moving to that point with orders to fortify a tete-de-pont and to build a good trestle
