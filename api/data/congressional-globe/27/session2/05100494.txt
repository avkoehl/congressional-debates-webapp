Mr. FILLMOKE's replv was not heard at the iepoitei'3

amendment for an entire otiifit

The next amendment of theSenate, striking1 out tie «umof
"821,244 33 fore mtingent e-spensesoi foreign intercoms-3, 'and
inserting, in lieu thereof, • thirty thousand dolíais," being un

Mr FJLLMOI1E said that the CommtUee of Ways and
Means had heretofore ertered mto a atnet examination of the
amountof these expenditures and approoimtio s, and ha!, as
the result of that examination, reduced the appropi'at on to the
amount as il stood in the bill, but having subbequen ly found
that the information on which the committee had acted waser
roneous, he moved, under the direction of the committee, that
the House toneurm the amendment of the Senate
And the amendment was concurred in
The proviso intcucdby the Senate to the same item, No 105,
being under considt i ation, in the words following
" And provided further, That no part of this appropriation
be applied, after the lu of July next, for compensa ion ti stp

this subject, which, he said, came under consideration aa long
ago as 1818, and also in 1834 and 1833; and it appeared that the
assumption of this power was immediately rebuked by Con-
gress Pnoi to 1818 the Executive had been in the habit of
appointing Indian agents with a saUiy of some $1,500 per
year, without any Itw authorizing it In 1818 two acta were
passed—the first declaring it unlawful to pay money to any In-
dian agent not appointed by the President and confirmed by the
Senate^and a contemporaneous act, fixing the salaiyofall the
Indian agents m existence It was soon found that the act estab*
hshmg the salary did not establish the office In 1834 the sub.
ject came under the consideration of Congress, and it was found
that there were a large number oflndien agencies not estab
lished by law, but the salaries of which had been paid from
year to yepr In 1834 Congie«s abolished every Indian agent,
and commenced anew, making, on paper, a great reform, so as
to save half the expenses of the department Immed.ately after
tttey pabsed the act instead of appointing Indian agents where
they had turned them out, who weie íeceivmg a salary of
£1,500, the> turned ovei and appointed oificeis under other
names—of removing agent , &c , and save them $2,000'
Mr E also adverted to tne post office law, which had been
parsed to pieven* the Postmaster Gtneial from appointing
and continuing «Jerks at an annual salary, under which, ha
said, no Psstma^ter General had su].p3sed he had authority to
appoint a clerk
The feecietary of State could not claim the authority of ap-
pointing these officers, foi there was no act wh ch gave him
the power of appointing any officer whatever, except certain
designated clerks with designated salaries Could this be
claimed under the diplomatic power, in the 1 ght of an office Í
If it was a dip'omatic appointment, then it was to be made by
the Piesident and Senate
The only ground on which this power could be claimed was
under the authority to expenda contingent fund He admitted
that, whenever a contingent fund was granted, the authority
was granted to expend tha' fun'—but on contingencies, and not
on annual salaries of officers The department could not fore-
see what contingencies would happen, and what force was ne
cessary, at thecommencemen  of a year, for that year, and it
was in then power to supply the force foi the time, but when
the expenses became necessaiy for every y^ar, they then
ceased to be contingencies, and should be provided for by
Congress-
What was the present easel He granted, whi'e this matter
remained a contingency, the Secretary of State was authorized
to pay for it out of the contingent fund, but when these con
tingencies came so together "that they required ihe constant
co operation of an agent whose whole time wasiequired, and
to whom an annual salary must be paid, it ceased to partake
of the character of a contingency and became a permanent
expenditure, and then, Tf necessary, (and he granted this was
necessary,) Congress should pass an act providing for it, and tjie
Secie'aiy of State was no longer authorized to pay this annual
salaiy undei the power to pay for contingencies
T us was the giound on which he obje* ted to this practice
He was dispo ed to concur in the amendment of tne Senate,
winch did not take effect immediately, but was delayed m
gniig into operation till the 1st of July He place I the subject
on its legal and propel foundation, and as a question of the au-
thority foi the appointment. He should vote for the admend-
ment oi the Senate
Mr JONES, of Virginia, was understood 'o mquire of the
chairman of the Committee of Way* ai d Means whether there
was any authority oí law for the appointment of despatch
a^ent^
Mr FILLMORE said he had not had occasion to examine
the'aw particu'arly onthissuhiect Heappiehended it might
be regaidtd as an incident of the powei of 'he diplomáticas
langeirenN and th^t ro special law authorised it
?Ir JONEtoexpressed hi-, entue concurrence in the views of
the gentlemnnliom "Vermont [Mr E\erett] and did not pro-
pose to go over the subject In a case li ke this, wiie^e the Con*
stitutionof thecouotrv (onempla'ed legislation, and such la.
gislation had not taken place, and these appointments had been
made in the absence of law, the path of duty was plain for them
all They could not give then sanction to an appointment
made without legal auihon y
He was perfectly satisfied of the sreat necessity that existed
for certainty and despatch m the tian«misst n of thesecommu*
nci ¡ons He referred to the clause m the Constitution au-
tnonzingthe Pre*identtonommate and,by aid wuhthe advice
and enpsent of the Serate, to appoint ambassadors &c , and
providing that Congress may ve-t the ap, ointment of such in-
ferior t fiicers as they may th nk proper in the Piesident alone,
in the courts of law, or in the heads of depaitments No such
power had been veited by Coneressm the Piesident or heads of
depar ments, and that power did not consequently exist in them
I be ng cleaily a case in which the Constitution contemplated
legislation, and the po^ei by legislation not having been confer-
red on i he heads of departments, he could not sanction it
Mr í ÍLLMORE said he had stated, in hi? previous remarks,
that he supposed the nbjec of the amendment io be to compel
leusi^ mu on this subject If he had understood the gentleman
fiom Vtrmoi t [Mr Lvcfett] coirectly, that was his view of
it The Senate intended to say that these despatch agentsshould
not be employed after the 1st July, unless authorised by law
Mr EVERETT had understood the gentleman as confining
his aigu nen ertirely to the question of the propriety of this
mole of { ome the husmees
Mr TÍLI MORE did not himself object to legislation on this
snVjfCf on thejcontraiy, he thought u would be very well Ha
did not think, however, that this was an anomalous case at all,
oi among the case s in whi h they had been in the habit of stri-
king outippropriatioiis In the Wa< Department, for instance,
they hid been in he habit of makingappiopmti ns from year
