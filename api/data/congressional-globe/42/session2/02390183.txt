Protection to American Industry—Mr. Hill.
Ho. 0F BEPS;
closed; when all were out of employment;
when starvation stared many in the face;
when work was not to be liad at any price;
when women and children begged from door
to door; when, alas! some sought for refuge
and alms at the county poor-house. I have
witnessed all these things there, and wish to see
no more such times of sorrow, want, and trial
among the honest poor. Under the present
protective policy of the Government the place
has prospered; all receive fair prices for their
labor; many have secured pleasant homes,
built from their own savings; many have now
deposits in savings banks; labor is respected,
and many of the working classes hold places
of honor and trust in the community; and
there is but one voice among them, and that
is, " Protect the manufacturing interests of
the country, and thereby you protect all who
are identified with them." I have received
numerous petitions from them and other citi-
zens of my district, asking that 110 reduction
be made in the present tariff.
I find among my files of papers an article
entitled " wages and the cost of living,'' writ-
ten by one who is well posted on this question,
published in the New York Tribune, February
27, 1S6K, which bears on the tariff and the
question of wages and the cost of living, and
wages paid in 1860 at the large iron establish-
ment where I reside, under the free-trade tariff
of 1857, when duty on pig iron was five dol-
lars a ton, and also wages paid in 1867. I
quote the whole article, and also present a
statement of wages paid at the same estab-
lishment at the present time:
Wages and the Cost of Living.
Boonion. New Jersey,
February 15, 1869.
To the Editor of the Tribune:
Sin: The assertions made by the Special Commis-
sioner of the Revenue, in his report for 1868, of the
present condition as regards the earnings and cost
of living of the working classes of the nation, are
so at variance with facts within my own knowledge,
and with the results of my own observations in an
extensive and intimate intercourse with our skilled
and unskilled workingmen, that I examined with
interest his tables showing their earnings and ex-
penses for 1860 and 1867, on which he bases his state-
ment of their present bad condition. The result
was to prove his figures as erroneous as his conclu-
sions, both tending to weaken the few valuable sug-
gestions in his report, and to throw discredit on his
other statistics.
In his table (page 15) giving the average increase
per cent, of 1867 over 1860 in the prices of " some of
the leading articles of domestic consumption," and
in house rent, the Commissioner has taken, with one
exception, articles so varying in price from differ-
ences in quality in the character of the seller and in
the character of the buyer, that his tablecould have
been made up with equal correctness and shown a
difference of twenty-live or fifty per cent, either
greater or less. Nor does he allow for the better
quality of the supplies required by the workingmen
as one of the natural consequences of their improved
condition. Conclusions drawn from such a table are
of no value in estimating the cost, of living.
The one exception, and one to which it is possible
to apply a test as to the correctness of the Commis-
sioner's figures, is *'iueI,coal, wood, &c. In this
article there is so little vanatiop in quality, m fjush-
ion, orin chances of manipulation on the part of the
latter that the true difference in the average Prices
of fuel between 1860 and 1867 is easily obtained. As
anthracite coal is the largest single item in the na-
tional consumption of fuel, and as all general causes
operating to raise or lower its price act with equal
force upon bituminous coal and wood, it is a sate
basis for this investigation. L . .
From the books of a large industrial establish-
ment m the middle States, consuming hundreds ot
thousands of dollars' worth of raw materials annu-
ally, and employing hundreds of skilled workmen
in an unusual variety of br&nches. mkI a corre-
spending proportion of unskilled labor I have
taken theaotual prices paid m I860 and in 1867 for
fifty thousand tons of lump Lehigh coal, with the
following results: 1860, Lehigh lump coal, m gold,
it 25 per ton : 1867. Lehigh lump coal, in currency,.
^ 1ft Norton: showing an increase m 186*
4 clrrenw over isw'in gold of 21.41 per cent., not
57 per cent., as the Commissioner's report makes
it—I mistake on his part of over 3o per cent. There
' another item in his table to which a local test can
be applied, (the locality is not greatly different from
many other manufacturing towns,) andtlbit is house
mi? Krom the actual rents paid m 1860 ami in 186,.
for twelvo buildings occupied
investment,) I find in 1860 twelve dwellings, kept in
good order and thorough repair, and rented to
twenty-eight families, paying from 87? cents to
$2 50 per week, weekly rent, $84 621; in 1867, the
same paying from one to three dollars per week,
weekly rent, &40 62hi showing an increase of only 17*
per cent, in place of the 65 per cent, claimed by the
Commissioner's table. But it is in tbe Commissioner's
statement of earnings that the greatest discrepan-
cies appear between his results and the facts. In
this table and statement, on pages 15, 16, &c., are
given, not theaotual prices paid for specific classes
of work, but tbe average weekly earnings of indi-
viduals and families.
Now it is evident that in ^ich a calculation the
condition of tho place and time of any particular
industry examined, tbe skill and experience of the
individual workman, and his personal habits of
industry and self-indulgence, must all be elements
iu the resulting average of weekly earnings; and
although the facts be all correctly stated and the
conclusions drawn be truly applicable to the indi-
vidual cases used, they are utterly worthless and in-
applicable in a general statement of the earnings
of the workingmen of the nation. In making up
the following table of wages paid at thesame estab-
lishment referred to in 1860 and in 1867, to different
clashes of workmen, I have not gone through the
entire list, butbave taken the controlling item in
each department, representing the greatest amount
of work and wages, and a fair exponent of the whole
work. These rates of wages were paid during the
entire years 1860 and 1867, and conformed to the
general rates of wages for the same work under like
conditions throughout the country, somewhat higher
than to the East and Jowertbanto the West. Ihave
added a column giving the increase in 1867 and 1860,
in the time at work and in the product. The excess
in product in 1867 and 1860 over and above the excess
in time at work indicates conclusively a steady
growth from 1860 to 1867, giving with thelarge in-
creased percentage of wages a square denial to the
Commissioner's report of the unsatisfactory con-
dition of industry. The results exhibited in the tol-
lowing table (and they cannot be controveted) show
an increase in the wages of skilled labor in 1867, over
1860, of 87£ per cent, against the 60 percent, alleged
by the Commissioner's report, and of 73 per cent, on
the wages of unskilled labor, instead of the 50 per
cent, exhibited by the report.

The animus of the Commissioner s report, and the
end it aims at, may be indicated by a few extracts.
Speaking of the " future financial policy 'hesays:
" The ends to be attained are
" a reduction of the cost of national productions.
Among the agencies adverse to national develop
ment he classes "the increased cost of nearly all
forms of labor;" that is, in short, ' high wages.
If that be so, then tbe empire of China, with its
millions toiling for a daily pittance of rice and an
annual cotton garment, should exemplify the high-
est condition of national development. w
Mr. Commissioner, there is a very efficient way to
cut down the cost of national pioduction. Iteduce
wages largely, so that the workingmen cannot main-
tain their present liberal scale of expenditures, and
the West Indian may again buy his cane-seat chairs
iu Philadelphia, and the Buenos Ayrean his lumber,
flour, clothing, wagons, &e.: but under the present
system both must wait until the home market isinrst
supplied, and production, under the pie&ent&Uiau-
lus, has exceeded consumption. The continued-high
prfce of all articles of general conssmpUtfn, no less
than the increased deposits in our savings' Banks*
coupled with our constantly increasing import, ana
the rapid enlargement of our means of intercoihmun -
ication, prove conclusively the general prosperity
of industry. The cry of hard times, national distress,
panic, and rum, that we hear from politicians ana
currency -doctors, can be found only among stock-
jobbers, speculators, traders carrymg gsfil out' of
proportion to their ballast, and the butterfly classes.
There is one class of our work-tngmen to whom the
Commissioner never alludes, of whose existence he
seems to be unaware: the men who till their own
farms—who raise tbe great bulk of the articles of
domestic consumption, the high prices of which
seem such ah evil to the Special Comniissiofter.
They, Lknow, ^wHl not see it in thes&ufe light. But
these mep, too, have votes. L.. B.

when cut-nails -were sent to foreign Countries
for a market, but it was only because -home
customers -could aot be found at feost prices;
while now the home market sweeps up every-
thing at CQ£t and satisfactory profits. • The
foreign workmen with their lew wages fcannot
begin to compete with our hard workingmen
in length of purse, so tbe foreign must wait
until the home market is surfeited.

Pig iron sold in this country at tweaty-o^ue
dollars in 1850, but when England bad brokea
down our competition by low tariff and selling
us at cost, until our mills and furnaces had
closed, pig iron wept up to thirty-seven dol-
lars in 1854, and they reaped the. benent—
and our manufacturers and laborers suffered;
and the same depression existed in the busi-
ness of the country as existed^ between 1834:
and 1842, as described hy a writer :
"Between 1834 and 1842 the tariff was again re-
pealed The mills were again stopped.. furnaces
closed, lands fallen to fcaif price, the sheriff at work,
States repudiating their debts, the Treasury enable
tn borrow at home or abroad, and bankrupt laws
passed by Congress. In 1812, the true American sys-
tem was again tried ; and in less than fire j-ears-tha
production of iron alone rose from two hundred
thousand tons to eight hundred, thousand tons.
