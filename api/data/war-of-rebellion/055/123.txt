RINGGOLD, GA., November 28, 1863.

Major-General REYNOLDS, Chattanooga:

GENERAL: Under the orders I now have [but just received from General Grant], I shall need 50,000 rations, to be sent out as soon as possible.

From information I have that the enemy are re-enforcing their troops at Tunnel Hill, said to be from Johnston's command, I have taken the liberty of retaining General Palmer's command until I can satisfy myself with regard to the accuracy of the report.

I inclose copy of General Grant's order.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S.-Of the order to General Palmer I only learned by chance. I have to request that all orders affecting my command may be sent through me.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, November 29, 1863-4 p.m.

Major-General PALMER:

The general commanding department directs that your troops resume their camps at Chattanooga. You will throw out a proper picket on our old front line. Starkweather's brigade has just started on an expedition on the top of Lookout Mountain.

Very respectfully,J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

From railroad crossing on Citico Creek to the Chimneys on Chattanooga Creek.
HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH AND TWELFTH CORPS, Ringgold, Ga., November 30, 1863.

Major-General REYNOLDS,Chief of Staff, Chattanooga:

Two contrabands, just arrived from Dalton, report the main force of the enemy gone beyond Dalton, about 300 men at Tunnel Hill, and the enemy's cavalry this side. The rations requested to be sent out yesterday morning have not arrived. I am without provisions for one brigade, and shall be compelled to return for them. The non-arrival of the train will, I now fear, compel me to leave some machinery, which I hoped to take back with me in the emptied wagons.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, November 30, 1863-9 a.m.
