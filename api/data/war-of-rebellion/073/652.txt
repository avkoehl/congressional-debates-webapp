Accompanying this will be found an official copy of regimental reports of regiments comprising the brigade; and, in conclusion, it becomes my duty to say that Colonel John Mehringer, commanding Ninety-first Indiana Volunteer Infantry; Colonel John C. McQuiston, commanding One hundred and twenty-third Indiana Volunteer Infantry; Lieutenant Colonel T. B. Waller, commanding Twentieth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry; Lieutenant Colonel H. S. Gillespie, commanding Fiftieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry; Major A. J. Bailey, commanding Twenty-seventh Kentucky Volunteer Infantry, all deserve to be mentioned in this report as having been most prompt and efficient in the execution of all orders and in the performance of their duties as commanders of their respective regiments. Their conduct has reflected credit upon the service as well as themselves.

Adjt. J. F. Crowley, Fiftieth Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry, acting assistant adjutant-general of the brigade, for close attention to official duties and true gallantry on the field, is worthy of most special mention in the history of the brigade during the campaign.
