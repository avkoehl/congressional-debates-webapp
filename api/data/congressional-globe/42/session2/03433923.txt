1872.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
up the question which was passed over on
page 6.
Mr, MORRILL, of Vermont. I will say to the
Senator from Indiana that I will propose here-
after,- if this shall be stricken out. at the proper
time to offer an amendment putting a specific
duty upon books, but differently classified
from this, and, as I think, better.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The ques-
tion is on the amendment of the Committee
on Finance striking out the clause which has
been read.
The amendment was agreed to.
The next amendment was in section four
to strike out lines eighty-five and eighty-six,
in the words, "on newspapers, magazines, and
periodicals, unbound, six cents per pound."
Mr. SCOTT. Before we pass from the
amendment in reference to'books, I wish to
make a suggestion. I understood that the
previous amendment with reference to paper
was reserved until that question of books
should be reached.
Mr. MORTON. That was my understanding.
Mr. SCOTT. Now we are passing from
hooks without disposing of the question in
regard to paper.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. That was
the understanding, the Chair is informed.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am willing to go back
to page 6, and take a vote on that question.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The vote
then by which the Senate agreed to the amend-
ment striking out this paragraph will be con-
sidered as reconsidered.
Mr. SHERMAN. Not at all. Let us go
back to the amendment on page 6 and dis-
pose of that.
Mr. MORTON." I thought they were both
to be disposed of together.
Mr. SHERMAN. They cannot be.
Mr. SCOTT. 1 cannotconsent to pass over
that duty on books uulessit is to be conaideied
in connection with the duty on paper.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. Perhaps it
"would be more germane to offer an amendment
in relation to hooks while we are on that para-
graph. 1 therefore offer the following. After
line seventy-three of this section, page 11
and in lieu of all there is down to line eighty
six, I wish to insert:
On books full-bound in calf, morocco, or ivory,
or bound with beveled edges, or bound with metal
coiners or ulasps, twenty cents per pound.
On all otliur books not otherwise provided for, ten
cents per pound.
On newspapers, magazines, periodicals, and pam-
phlets, six cents per pound.
I will merely say that this is an extremely
low duty, but it is specific. I am fully con-
scious that it is not what will be quite satisfac-
tory to the book publishers of the country, but
at the same time it is fixed and certain, and I
believe they prefer almost anything to the pres-
ent ad valorem system. We were all witnesses
til is winter to what was done by an English firm
that came here and sold books day alter day at
auction, sometimes for a quarter part of what
they would be invoiced at to any wholesale
dealer in the country, and the Treasury officers
did all they could to ascertain how they circum-
vented our tariff laws and the custom-housp,
but it was impossible to track and find them out.
Mr. MORION. Will the Senator state how
much better his amendment would be for the
publishers than the present lawin his opinion?
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. I do not
think it is any more. It does not raise the
duty. I think it myself a little better than the
present twenty-live per cent., as it is fixed to
tbtt parties cannot bring in their invoices of
books at one fifth or one sixth of what they
really cost abroad.
Mr. BAYARD. Does the honorable Sena-
tor state, in reply to the Senator from Indiana,
that his proposition lessens the presentduty on
books?
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. The ten cents,
I say does upon the average.
Mr. BAYARD, Why, sir, the rate of ten
cents per pound is an increase of some eighty
per cent, over the present duties.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. The Senator
from Delaware is entirely mistaken.
Mr. BAYARD. There are specimens of
books lying now on the table of the Finance
Committee, cheap publications.suchasaveused
by the poorer class of people. The price of
thebook is given, thedutyunderthe twenty-five
per cent, ad valorem rate, and the ad valorem
at twelve cents per pound, and the increase of
duty is one hundred per cent.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. It is very
true that you may select a given book and
prove anything by it. You may select one
of the Oxford Bibles that are printed, heavily
bound in sheep, and which.are stereotyped, and
show that any rate by the pound is an extrav-
agant duty ; but I am taking the average run
of books, and 1 undertake to say that ten cents
a pound is not increasing the duty, but is rather
lowering it. It is only fixing it at a proper
rate. The common practice abroad in rela-
tion to books is this: take what is called a
fashionable novel; as soon as the season is
over it pells for little or nothing abroad ; they
use their types then, and all it costs is the
paper and the labor of striking off copies, of
which they can ship any quantity here for the
mere cost of the paper and printing.
Under the circumstances I believe that the
only solution of the present difficulty between
paper and books at this time is to put a spe-
cific duty upon books ; and I am quite sure
that twenty cents a pound upon costly illus-
trated books with plates, elegantly bound in
full calf and morocco and ivory and with bev-
eled edges and with metal clasps, will not be
too much. The parties who use them are
those who can afford such articles of luxury,
and should b  made to pay for them.
Mr. SHERMAN. This amendment involves .
a very important question, which was very
carefully considered by the Committee on
Finance, and they were very strongly of the
opinion that it was impossible to levy a spe-
cific duty upon books. I think I can demon-
strate to any one who is a lover of books that
it is impossible to levy any specific duty upon
books. For years it has been the desire of
the publishers of this country to have a spe-
cific duty levied on books, and finally they
have succeeded in getting the proposition
through the House to levy a duty of twelve
and a half cents a pound on books. The ab-
surdity of that proposition must strike any one
who will reflect for a moment. You take the
finest volume bound in calf, gilt-edged, on the
finest paper, a book that is worth five or ten
dollars, and you tax that book at the same
rate per pound that you would a poor man's
spelling-book, or the cheapest Bible, or the
cheapest form of publication.
Now, what is the result? I have here a
statement summing up in a few figures the
whole result of this proposition:

The duty on this shipment at twelve and a half cents per pound would be equal to thirty-three and
one fourth per cent, ad valorem.
These books wore bought and invoiced at the current trade price in London, and were not shipped by
publishers on consignment at cost price.
On this shipment nine cents per pound would have been equal to twenty-flvo per cent, ad valorem.
These figures show that from the nature of
things it is impossible to levy a specific duty
on books. These are things that cannot be
estimated by weight; they must be estimated
by their contents and by the cost of produc-
tion. You may levy a duty on coffee and tea
and other articles of tropical countries, which
do not enter into competition with our own
industry, by the pound, and you may create
inequality by that mode of levying duties; but
you cannot in the nature of things levy a duly
per pound oil books, because it is oppressive
to the poor and absolutely indifferent to the
rich. The result is that law books, expensive
books, may be imported into this country at a
duty of from ten to fifteen per cent., and an-
nuals, expensive Bibles, all the elegant works
of ait. that may be brought into this country,
at a rate of duty from seven to fifteen percent.
ad valorem, while upon the cheap Bible, a
specimen ot which my friend from Delaware
has gone to get, and various forms of books
that were shown us, the iucrease of duty by
the proposed rate of twelve and a half cents a
pound is three hundred per cent.
The Commiitee on Finance, who approached
the subject with every desire to have a specific
duty in order to avoid the clearly proven frauds,
rejected the proposition for a specific duty and
felt it was not proper to levy a specific duty on
We had specimens; for instance, ele-
gant little Bibles, and prayer-books; one I
remember that would not weigh more than
three or four ounces where the actual cost was
probably three or four dollars, and yet we had
other books where the cost was twenty-five
cents, and especially Bibles and books of a
religious character which are published in
England, many of them by religious societies
at a low price, merely for the purpose of dis-
tributing that kind of information all over the
world, where the rate of duty of twelve and
a half cents a pound would be equivalent to
one hundred per cent., or four times the pres-
ent rate.
Under these circumstances it Is obvious to
any one who will examine it closely that it is
impossible to levy a specific duty. The prop-
osition of the Senator from Vermont is much
better than the proposition sent to us by the
House. That levies twenty cents a pound on
the expensive books, which would be an ad
valorem of ten or fifteen per cent., while the
duty of ten cents a pound on the cheaper
books would bean average of fifty to sixty per
cent, on the cheaper forms of books. On a
Bible that was furnished us the increase of
duty was one hundred per cent. Here, for
instance, [exhibiting a book,] is a book that
every one would say was a good book, ele-
gantly printed ; it is rather better than an aver-
age book. . The cost price iu London of this
