General BRAXTON BRAGG, Commanding Army of the West:

GENERAL: By order of the honorable Secretary of War I have the honor to transmit herewith instructions for Captain Edward B. Sayers, directing him to make reconnaissance of the Cumberland and Tennessee Rivers with a view to an early occupation of the best points by fortifications commanding obstructions in their channels. For the construction of all these works liberal appropriations have been asked of Congress. The limits within which the proposed defenses can be placed will depend upon the extent of the country controlled by your army. On this point Captain E. B. Sayers is instructed to confer with you and will be guided by your directions. For the performance of the service intrusted to Captain E. B. Sayers I have respectfully to ask you to afford him every necessary assistance, and, if required, protection against the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. GILMER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Engineer Bureau.
