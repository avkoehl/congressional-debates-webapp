battery now, as eight guns are rather more than the brigade can take care of. Colonel Smyth is now here, and if you accede to the suggestion he will order the battery to report to General Hunt.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 19, 1864. (Sent 10.45 a.m.)

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,September 19, 1864.

Lieutenant BENYAURD,

Engineer:

To-morrow I wish you would look at the embrasures on the southwest side of the fort, on the plank road, hitherto known as Fort Crawford. You will find the embrasures do not admit of a sufficient field of fire. None on the south side can see so far to the left as the angle of Fort Alexander Hays. All the embrasures on that side require widening on the left-hand faced, and on the other side also, and some of them both ways. I do not know who is in charge, but I venture to predict that a nice engineer would condemn the direction of the left face of the redoubt building in front of the Westbrook house-that is, if I understand the object of that redoubt. See Michler about it; he will know.

Your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 19, 1864-4.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

One of our outposts just sent in reports having heard a heavy rumbling of wheels, as if artillery was moving. The Fourth South Carolina and Sixth North Carolina Cavalry are just put on picket. The call (boots and saddles) has been blown. Frequent tinkling of cow bells as if their pickets were being posted.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
