General Ammen and General Gillem to co-operate with him. Burbridge will take three old regiments and the remainder twelve-months' Kentucky troops. After the expedition is ended the old regiments will be sent, via Knoxville, to Atlanta. Meanwhile I will have my other regiments here remounted and read to go to the front. If General Gillem is to operate in my department, I think he should be ordered to report to me.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

I have no objection to General Gillem's reporting temporarily to General Schofield, but he must leave his DIVISION of cavalry on the Nashville and Northwestern Railroad.
