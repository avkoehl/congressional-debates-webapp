CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report everything quiet on my line. The officer in front of Bottom's Bridge reports that the enemy's bugles sounded in the night, and the movement of wheels from their right to left could be heard for several hours afterward. I have moved my command some 3 miles farther down the river into a clean locality, and have established pickets as far as Jones' Bridge, about 9 miles fromm here. A party crossed the river at Jones' Bridge yesterday and to the high land beyond, and saw no indications of the presence of the enemy in that vicinity. I should state that there is no apparent change in the enemy's pickets, at Bottom's Bridge.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
