EXTRAVAGANCE Ot THE ADMINISTRATION.
Mr. HEREFORD. Mr. Speaker, when we
""take our seats each morning the Daily Globe
\js placed upon our desks, which has for its
motto the following significant noble senti-
"iiaent: "The world is governed too much."
If the members of this House, especially the
- dominant party, had in times past been gov-
erned by that sentiment, we would have been a
Wealthier, more powerful, and happier people.
I propose in the few remarks I shall submit
;on this occasion to show wherein we have vio-
lated that maxim ; wherein we have been and
are governed too much, taxed too much.
In the first place, what is the one fact that
the party in power most plumes itself upon as
recommending it to a favorable consideration
. of the American people, and in consideration
> pf which fact, more than ail others, it asks for
- another four years' lease of its power? It is
" 'that it has reduced the public debt a certain
amount. _ Every mouth it is heralded forth that
" the public debt has been decreased a certain
f amount. Now, let ns examine this subject for
^".a moment. Suppose you had an agent, and
■there had been paid iuto his hands of your
assets $1,000, and when you called upon him
for a settlement he should say, and that, too,
-with an air of triumph and seif-satisfaction,
"It is true you have paid into my hands as
agent $1,000, but I have paid ten dollars
of your debts;" would you not ask him what
' ad become of the other $990?
That is just what the American people are
doing to-day. According to the finance report
for 1871, submitted to the Forty Second Con-
gress by the present Secretary of the Treas-
ury, on page 369, we find that the debt of the
Government reached its maximum, its highest
-figure, July 1, 1866, when it was, according
to that report, $2,773,236,173 69.
B.y the same report we are told, on page
364, that since the war closed there has been
■ received into the Treasury in—
  $619,646,647 91
  490,634,010 27
l§67-68   405,638,083 32
      370,945,817 94
1869-' ?  411,255,477 63
1870-7 1  383,323,944 89
Making a total of $2,681,443,981 !
According to a report of the same officer,
sent into this Congress in answer to a resolu-
tion offered by my friend from New York,
[Mr. Wood,] he shows us that there has been
received into the Treasury from June 30,1871,
. the date last referred to, up to March 1, 1872,
the additional sum of §250,509,988 50; mak-
ing, according to the reports of the Treasury
Department, the enormous sum of $2,930,-
053,970 46 since the close of the war. But
large as those receipts seem to be, we must
not stop there. The Secretary of War also, in
. answer to a resolution introduced by nay friend
from Kentucky [Mr. Beck] March 11, 1872,
shows that there has been received by the War
Department in excess of appropriations since
June 30, 1865, and which amount has never
heretofore appeared in any report as received
into the Treasury, the sum of $107,959,416 62;
which amount, added to the previous receipts,
as shown by the various Departments them-
selves, makes the amount received into the
Treasury since the war closed, all of which
time the Republican party has had the control
of the Government, the enormous sum of
$3,039,993,387 08, which is $266,757,213 39
more than the whole debt of the United States
amounted to July 1, 1866. Now, in the name
of common honesty and common sense, what
Comes of all this morality, boasting, and
parade of the decrease of the public debt?
Nor do I stop here. By their own showing
they have sold $8,280,093 13 worth of arms
to the French Government, which has never
been accounted for in these reports.
Nor can I stop here. At the close of the
war, as shown by the Navy Register of that'
year, we had belonging to the Navy six hun-
dred and eighty three vessels; now, according
to the same authority, we have only one hun-
dred and seventy seven; making five hundred
and six that have been disposed of by that
Department. Nearly three times as many ves-
sels have been sold, or in some way disposed
of, as are now in the Navy. What has become
of this vast armament, this mighty fleet of
vessels? Sold! What has become of the
money? Who knows how much they were
worth? No wonder we have not sufficient
Navy to protect our citizens in foreign lands 1
No wonder the eloquent voices of the distin-
guished gentlemen from Indiana [Mr. Voor-
hees] and from Massachusetts [Mr. Banks]
and others fell unheeded the other day in
these Halls in favor of the release of Dr.
Houard, who is now confined in chains by
Spanish authority 1
What answer is it to the people, whose agents
you are, to say that you have decreased the
debt since the war $494,716,575 15, when they
have paid you nearly seven times as much,
namely, $3,039,993,387 08? What answer is
it to the people when you nor, only have re-
ceived that amount besides the $8,280,093 13
received for the arms sold to the French, and
also the five hundred and six vessels sold from
the Navy? You can no longer deceive the
people; they will hurl you from power as
unworthy agents.
What has gone with all this almost incon-
ceivable amount of money? In the brief
space of time allotted me 1 will attempt to
show where a small part has gone.
During the six years preceding the present,
which has been in a time of profound peace,
according to the same report there has been
expended for military service the sum of
$673,583,398 14, and during the same period
for our naval establishment the sum of
$161,307,190 81; to which last sum should be
added the amount for which the five hundred
and six vessels were sold. American citizens,
read these figures, and then tell me whether
you have a civil or military Government!
Is it not high time that you should arouse
from your lethargy? Is it not high time that
you should rise in the might and majesty of
your power and reassume the powers that of
right belong to you?
Why, during the whole of President Polk's
administration, when we had on our hands the
Mexican war, the whole expenditures of the
War Department was only $79,687,028 40;
during the four years preceding that, under
John Tyler's administration, when we were at
peace, as we now are, the whole expenses for
military service wasonly $23,538,903 87, which
is only about one half that spent last year
for military purposes, as shown by the Secre-
tary's report. He says in that report that the
expenses for that year were $44,080,084 95,
which is a larger amount spent last year for
military purposes alone, when we are at peace
with all the world, than had ever been spent
by any Administration in the same length of
time for all purposes since the foundation of
the Government down to and including 1852-53.
What a change in less than twenty years! Is
it not time that we stop and-reflect?
In the same finance report we find that
for the "net ordinary expenses of the Gov-
ernment" for the years 1852-53 we paid
$44,078,156 35; for the same purpose in 1870-
71, $157,583,827 58; nearly four times as
much; and that enormous increase in the short
spaee of eighteen years! But you will please
bear in mind that the above amount of $157,-
583,827 58 is only the " net ordinary expenses
of the Government;" for in fact the whole
expenditures, as shown by the same report on
page 5, amount to $300,457,281 38. Let us
draw another comparison: during; the years
1852-53, 1851-52,1850-51,1849-50, the whole
expenses of the Government, during those four
years was only $165,684,050 48; while we
now have for like expenses in one year $157,-
583.827 58. During the four years preceding,
during which we carried on the Mexican war to
a successful termination, by which we acquired
and paid for our Pacific possessions, the whole
expenses of the Government amounted to
only $16o,381,026 34. Behold what a con-
trast ! During these four years we carried on
a war upon a foreign land for two years, and
the public expenditures during those four
years is but little more than it is now under
this Administration in one year.
Before, I have shown you that during six
years preceding the present year the expenses
for the Army were $673,583,398 14, and the
Navy $161,307,190 81, making a total for
Army and Navy during that period of $834,-
890,588 95. When we behold these enormous
expenditures in time of profound peace under
the administration of a military President, sur-
rounded^ by military private secretaries, and
other military officers, with an army of thirty
thousand soldiers, we are not surprised that
he^should send in to us a message in February,
18<1, likening our simple democratic Govern-
ment to the empire of Germany, and trying to
show the similarity of the two Governments.
I have no doubt that his distempered and
fevered imagination is filled with stars, gar-
ters, diamonds, and glittering crowns, and
that he looks forward to the time when the
similitude will be extended, and that he can
declare himself emperor of the United States
as William declared himself emperor of Ger-
many. No doubt he would like to have the
same provision in our Constitution that is iu
theirs, namely, " The laws of the empire shall
take precedence of those of each individual
State."
1 have no doubt when he sent in that mes-
sage be had just gotten up from reading the
constitution ot the German empire, in which
we find, among others, the following provis-
ions :
"The emperor shall represent the empire among
nations, declare war and conclude peace in the
name of the same.
" The emperor shall have the right to convene the
federal council and diet, and to open, adjourn, and
close the same.
" The emperor has the supreme supervision of
the administration of mailsand telegraphs.
"It shall be the duty of all officers of the post
office and telegraph department to obey imporial
orders. This obligation shall be included in their
oath ot office.
"Every Gorman capable of bearing arms shall
serve seven years in the standing army."
By sending in such messages he and his
adherents seek to accustom the American
mind to yield its assent to the similarity, and
finally to force them to make the formal change
in our form of government which has already
been made in fact. Already has this military
Chief Magistrate usurped the powers of the
States by sending his armies iu time of peace
and on days of election into the great States
of Pennsylvania and New York and my own
State, WesS Virginia, to awe, intimidate, and
control the voters. Again, we see one of his
grand marshals (Sheridan) taking possession
and control of the great city of Chicago. Thus
step by step are the military made superior to
the civil authorities. Since the war we have
seen newspapers suppressed in the South, but
the Imperialist, a newspaper published in New
York in favor of an imperial form of govern-
ment, was allowed to issue its deadly poi-
son without molestation. And it is a signifi-
cant fact that it expired with the death of
President Grant's Secretary of War, General
Rawlings. " He (Rawlings) had come to
believe that Rome was never so well governed
or so happy as under her kings, and that the
good government and happiness of this vast
country require that it should be centralized
into a nation and governed by an emperor."
We have seen that in the constitution of the
German empire there is the following pro-
vision :
" The emperor has the supreme supervision of the
administration of mails and telegraphs."
Now, as an additional proof that President
