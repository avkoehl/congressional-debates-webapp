Colonel O. D. GREENE, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to request that the letters and telegrams to myself from the major-general commanding, relative to the calling into service of the Enrolled Missouri Militia of this district, be carefully examined, and that the censure for irregularity and reproof for exceeding my authority, this day administered from department headquarters, be withdrawn.

Said authority was revoked by Colonel Greene, assistant adjutant-general, thee 23rd instant, and I have since that date ceased to order any militia into service.

The general feeling among the Union men of this place is insecurity. They are liable any night to destruction. Hence, my dear friend General Fisk, a terrific spirit is beginning to kindle among the Union masses fearful to contemplate.
