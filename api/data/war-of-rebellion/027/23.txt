HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 24, 1862-10 p. m.

(Received October 24, 1862.)

General M. C. MEIGS, Quartermaster-General:

Your dispatch is received. On the 21st instant 12,000 pairs of bootees arrived at the Harper's Ferry depot. Over 7,000 pairs are now on hand, but are sizes higher than Numbers 9. I asked that extraordinary sizes should not be sent; they are utterly useless. No bootees have arrived since. More than 30,000 pairs have been received altogether, and over 10,000 pairs are on the way here.

The clothing has uniformly arrived slowly. That ordered to Hagerstown on the 7th did not arrived long after Stuart's last raid. It is not detained in cars at the depots. Such complaints are groundless. The fact is, the clothing arrives and is issued, but more is still wanted. I have ordered more than would seem necessary any data furnished me, and I beg to remind you that you have always very promptly met all my requisitions. So far as clothing is concerned, our department is not at fault; it provides as soon as due notice is given.

I foresee no time when an army of over 100,000 men will not call for clothing and other articles.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 25, 1862-1.30 p. m.

(Received October 25, 1862-1.45 p. m.)

General MEIGS:

In my dispatch of last night I should have written 20,000 instead of 12,000 bootees received on 21st instant at Harper's Ferry. At the three depots, Harper's Ferry, Frederick, and Hagerstown, there have been received about 40,000 pairs of boots altogether. Some 10,000 more are in transitu, and 15,000 additional ordered. Clothing will come forward as rapidly as it can be transported and issued.

By mail I will send detailed statement. The amounts ordered would seem ample. Of course clothing will be wanted all the time, and can be provided even on the march.

The suffering for want of clothing is exaggerated, I think, and certainly might have been avoided by timely requisitions of regimental and brigade commanders.

RUFUS INGALLS,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp, Chief Quartermaster.
