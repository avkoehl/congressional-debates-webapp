General JEFF. C. DAVIS:

Communicate with General Howard, and be prepared to send into Atlanta all your troops and to move, with ten days' rations, toward Marietta or to Fairburn, as the case may call for. I think Hood has crossed the Chattahoochee with two corps to attack our road, and has left one corps on this side, near Campbellton. We should interpose.

Major-General SHERMAN:

(Through General Elliott, chief of cavalry.)

One of my scouts just in reports nothing at Burnt Hickory, and one regiment of Texan cavalry, 400 or 500 strong, at Dallas. Rebel parties are gathering forage, &amp;c., and taking it toward Cedartwon. I have sent to Villa Rica and Buchanan to-day. I can't picket Burnt Hickory; it is seventeen miles from here. I have only 170 mounted men, but send scouts there daily.

Brigadier-General.
