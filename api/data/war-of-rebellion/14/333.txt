
safety of this country do one of two things without delay, remove this army or send to it re-enforcement of 100,000 men.

Please let me hear from you.

Your friend,

E. D. KEYES,

P. S.- I have kept the foregoing two days to determine whether or not I should change my opinion and retain it. I have concluded, however, to send it; the sickliness of this country in August and September being one of the strongest reasons for withdrawing.
