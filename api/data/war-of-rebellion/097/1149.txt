NEW YORK, May 13, 1865.

(Received 10 a.m.)

EDWARDS PIERREPONT.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, May 13, 1865. (Sent 5.20 p.m.)

Honorable EDWARDS PIERREPONT,

New York:

I have proof of express personal malice against me by Greeley, and believe that I can establish a combination between him and others which may end in accomplishing my death, as it did against Mr. Lincoln and Mr. Seward. This is my reason for distinguishing his case from others of general vituperation.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

(Same to Honorable F. B. Cutting.)

PHILADELPHIA, May 14, 1865.

(Received 6.10 p.m.)

General J. A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

It was my intention to have returned to Washington this evening, but I find myself too unwell to do so. It is not probable that I shall be able to go before Tuesday.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

RICHMOND, May 14, 1865.

(Received 3 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Washington:

Major-General Wright is now here, and reports everything in the southern counties as quiet as could well be expected. General Ord has been ordered to relieve the Sixth Corps, which will probably reach Richmond on its way to Alexandria about the last of this week.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General, Commanding.
