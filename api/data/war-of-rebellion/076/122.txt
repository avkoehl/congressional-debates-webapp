Major T. T. ECKERT:

Am here crossing to rebuild the line and add another wire between this and Atlanta. Line not working south in consequence of storm, though it has worked well all day. Rebels last night withdrew entirely from west bank Chattahoochee, and burned bridge. Said that Johnston is moving toward Stone Mountain, and will not oppose advance on Atlanta. Garrard and General Schofield across Chattahoochee, and intrenched to protect crossing of rest of army, which will cross on the 12th or 13th.
