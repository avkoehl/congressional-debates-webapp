Numbers 141. Report of Captain Robert B. Brown, Second Massachusetts Infantry, of operations January 17-March 24.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND MASSACHUSETTS INFANTRY,Near Goldsborough, N. C., March 25, 1865.

SIR: In obedience to circular from headquarters Second Brigade of this date I have the honor to submit the following report of operations during the late campaign:

On the 17th of January last we broke camp near Savannah and crossed the Savannah River, marching toward Purysburg, S. C., which we reached on the 19th. Leaving Purysburg on the 26th we marched toward Robertsville, and camped on the Sister's Ferry road on the 29th.

On the 2nd of February we moved from Robertsville, cutting loose from our base, moving in the direction of the Charleston and Augusta Railroad, which we reached at 4. 30 p.m. on the 7th, this regiment forming the advance guard of the corps. On the 8th and 11th we were at work on the railroad, destroying it, together with about 200,000 feet of lumber that lay near the track; about two-thirds of a mile of track was entirely destroyed by the command.

Nothing of any importance occurred until the afternoon of March 2, when the command reached Chesterfield. On entering town, Lieutenant Colonel C. F. Morse being absent as general officer of the day, I received an order from Colonel William Hawley, commanding brigade, to move with this regiment on the Winnsborough road, and receiving my instructions from Captain Gildersleeve, provost-marshal First Division, Twentieth Corps, we moved about twenty rods on this road, when we struck the skirmishers of the enemy, I was immediately ordered to halt with my command until further orders. I placed my command in position to hold the road, and remained till ordered forward by Colonel Hawley. Advancing, we drove the enemy from a bridge on Thompson's Creek which he was destroying, wounding one man, with no loss to ourselves. On the 14th, having crossed the Cape Fear River, we moved with the Thirteenth New Jersey Volunteers About eight miles out on the Raleigh plank road, loading eight wagons with corn and fodder, and returning to the camp of the brigade at night. Having moved with the brigade the night previous to the support of General Kilpatrick, on the 16th, at 7 a.m., we moved in line of battle, this regiment forming the e extreme left of the brigade. Captain J. I. Grafton, having moved in front of the battalion in command of Companies K and I, struck the enemy's skirmishers and drove them to their works. The skirmishing was very hot for about two hours, all the ammunition of the regiment being expended, except that of two companies, when we were relieved by troops of the Third Division of this corps.

Too much cannot be said of the skill and bravery of Captain J. I. Grafton, who commanded the advance, and fell mortally wounded after establishing his line under the guns of the enemy, who, with a severe fire of canister, were unable to dislodge it. About 3. 30 p.m. this command having moved to the right of the line became engaged. Lieutenant-Colonel Morse being wounded I assumed command of the regiment. Being relieved about 5 p.m. by the Fourteenth Corps we moved into reserve. The losses in this action were as follows. *
