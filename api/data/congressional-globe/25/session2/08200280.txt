his political encunes at home, lo the gieat delight
and gli ly of his friends ibere The election of the
place was truly unfortun tie, m many parliculais,

h n e vv is ncer intended as an arena for hutting
dv,pl íiji, to gull, excite, and delude the people, by a
bid >n ' -stk'ess disci arge of evtry sppeips of po-
lín.. I hli! nW, I11 the great anrO}ance and ob-
s ructicn f all impoit^nt public busii ess It was
a most tironeou id( 1 tnat seemed to be enter-
t mi d by certain g itlemen, that tl ty were sent
1 ie to cutei and kuckstir lor low, party purposes,
in 1 10 sCtve their Pre idenoal candidates Sir,
ihis is no part of the duties of a member of Con-
go ss It be'oo^s more appropriately lo another
place faest are matters that should br settled by
tne fsOp e at home, placed far from the influence
ml txedements of Congressional «ungues. Had
tie in" lit ti cu ¡suited some of his senior, in
nikmg this mg 'ai and extraordinary attempt,
lliey i «. ilhift tod him, from sad experience,
the mutihtv oí making electioneering harangues on
the floor of Congress, with a view of effecting an
influence abroad. Sir, the attempt has been before
made here, and has failed, and proved worse than
abortive. The halls of Congress are the last places
that should be converted into political and elec-
tioneering arenas, and can never be done but at
the expense of the gieat purposes for which we are
constitutionally assembled here
It has never been attempted without inflicting a
wound, either on the feelings of one party or the
other, or at the grsat obstruction of public busi-
ness, and the important interests of the country.
Jf such remai Its are intended lor home consump-
tion, and to effect ulterior interests there, I put the
¿question, as. the member professes himself a politi-
cal economist, if the time he has consumed, and
which he will cause to be consumed, will not
amount, m fact, to more than twice the amount of
expenditure to which he has made his objection. I
venture to affirm that the speech of that member
has and will cost the Government more than twice
the amount of the appropriation upon which it has
been made
This, then, is a specimen of the members eco-
nomy in public expenditures,. If, however, the
true object of the member is to address the people
of New Jersey from the floor of Congress, would
it not be more economical to the Government to
write them a ctrculur, as is usual amongst mem-
bers, and have it published at his own expense?
Sir, it would be by far more in accordance with
that ngid economy that the member has so zeal-
ously advocated, and of which I myself approve.
Had that member to pay out of his own pocket
the expense for the loss of time to the Government
and to the people, by his long electioneering
speeches, it is much to be doubted whether we
should have them as long and a  frequent as the
member is disposed now 10 afflict the House with.
It is to be hoped if in future any member is dis-
posed to address his. constituents m an electioneer-
ing speech, ii he is a strenuous advocate for eco-
nomy, th it he may do it at his own expense. He
[Mi B J could never sivc his consent that the time
of this House, which was intended for higher pur-
poses, should be consumed in mere electioneer-
ing bitmgigale, for the edification and instruction
ol the most teckless and dissolute paitisans. A
w isc man had said that there was a time and a
place fur all things, and it never was moieapplica-
ble than to the present occasion. The member
seemed entirely to have forg- itten that any expense
that he and his party might run the Government
to, would be at all felt by the people, or objected lo
He seemed unconscious that he and 1 is party had
eoncmred in and supported nearly every extrava-
gant expenditure that had been made by the Go-
vernment for the last ten years or more. He had
been exceedingly unfortunate m falling upon the
subject of extravagance, as it was the very subject,
above every other, of which his party could have
b< en shown to have been most guilty.
LUravagant appropriations and prodigal expen-
ditures, it couííl be easily shown by the records and
journals of the Hou^e, were, most of all others, the
crime of the party to which the member belonged,
and of which they could at all times be most easily
convicted, or whenever it might be thought neces-
sary by their opponents to convict them Should
the member in future be disposed to commence his
political hustings, it were greatly to be hoped that
he would select some other arena than the Hall of
the House of Representatives Such a course was
too expensive to the public, and too well calculated
to embarrass th« public business, to the wcoave-
mence of the great body of the community. He,
thertfjre, hoped that the practice would not be
repeated on that floor ei'her by the member or by
ihose who acted in concert with him there, as all
could, on its first blush, see its most glaring impro-
priety
But, sir, the member had, in his usual mode
of pursuing a back trail after the scent had be-
come stale a"d cold, m his onslaught against the
measures of this Adunmslration and the Republican
party, fallen back and pounced upon the back of
our old, venerable ex-President. He had showered
vo'ley after volley of abuses on the head of Gen.
Jac'ison, and had represented him g& f&ittfless,
imbecile, treacherous, and deceptive,, ehatae^tiiijed^ *
