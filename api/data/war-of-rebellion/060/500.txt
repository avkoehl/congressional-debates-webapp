a battery having left this point up to this time. I fear General Kelley's apprehensions of a very formidable attack are being realized, expectations being now entertained that the movement may extend into Pennsylvania, for the procurement of cattle and supplies.

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CUMBERLAND, February 2, 18964.

Captain MYERS,

North Branch Bridge:

Can infantry be got across the river? Colonel Mulligan occupies Burlington and the Moorefield Junction to-night and I expect four regiments of cavalry in Romney to-night from General Sullivan's command. I think you might push on to-morrow morning and proceed cautiously on the track of Rosser. He may go east through Springfield. If he does, you must send a messenger to our cavalry at Romney, so he can be cut off. Do you think the enemy were at Green Spring or South Branch bridge?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, February 2, 1864-5 p. m.

Colonel MOODY,

North Branch:

Remain at the bridge to-night. Where is the Ringgold cavalry? Are they at the bridge? What is the damage to the wire?

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
