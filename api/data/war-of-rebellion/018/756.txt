Major-General McDowell, being charged with the advance forces ordered to pursue the enemy, directs me to inform you that your corps will be followed immediately by King's division, supported by Reynolds'.

Heintzelman with his corps, preceded by Ricketts' division, will move on your right, on the road from Sudley Springs to Hay Market. He is instructed to throw out skirmishers to the left, which it is desirable you should join on with your right.

Organize a strong advance to precede your command, and push on rapidly in pursuit of the enemy until you come in contact with him. Report frequently.

Bayard's brigade of cavalry will be ordered to report to you. Push it well off to the left as you advance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,
