Assistant Adjutant-General.

MACON, MO., September 10, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have made a personal inspection of the important bridges on the North Missouri Railroad and established at each a permanent guard. The block-houses are in good condition. I send 300 of Dyer's regiment (dismounted) into the brush in Boone to-night. The officers and men taken from the captured railroad train by the bushwhackers will be brought into Sturgeon this evening. We make no exchanges, simply get four white sheep for one lame black one got out of our pasture. I have no direct report from the different detachments after the guerrillas in Howard, but learn indirectly that our troops are going a good work. The new regiments will soon be in condition to be effective.
