It is most important to have the gunboats watch the rebels on the river.

Porter writes me that they are playing the same game with him in trying to cut off supplies. They are 2,000 or 3,000 strong up there.

Very respectfully,

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Rear-Admiral.

SIR: There is a large force of the enemy around in the vicinity of this post. It has been reported as high as 18,000. I think, from the information I have received, there may be 10,000 or 12,000.
