COLONEL: I start in the morning, God willing. Inclosed please find copy of order relieving General Knipe.* All things considered, I believe this to be for the good of the service. I also inclose you copy of letter which i have written to General West.+ I send the package for General West, which please deliver to him as soon as he arrives. I respectfully suggest that the detachment of general Lucas' brigade which is to come from Pensacola be ordered to follow us, unless its arrival should be deployed for two days from this date, when it might be ordered to report to General West until the command can be concentrated. The mail for our headquarters will be sent from New Orleans to you, and I will be under obligations if you will forward it by first opportunity. If it meets the general's approval, I think it will be well to have Captain Harrison, special inspector of cavalry, remain at New Orleans to attend to the reception and proper distribution of horses which may arrive to the dismounted troops at different points on the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
