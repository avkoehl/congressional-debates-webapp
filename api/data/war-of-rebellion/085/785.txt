the citizen guards, there are about 800 at Sedalia, 300 at Warrensburg, and 300 at Lexington. They have been ordered to gather up all the horses in the country and protect them as well as use them. I have no means of communicating with either Lexington or Boonville at this time.

Major-General PLEASONTON,

Jefferson City:

The progress of the boats is very slow, and when Mower's command can reach it is impossible to say. They left day before yesterday and yesterday. All efforts will be made, but my present impression is that our aim cannot be north of the Pacific Railroad. We ought to get Warsaw.

I shall direct General Fisk to remain where he is and send his boats back for other troops, when he can be crossed to the south side as soon as the force is strong enough to do so. The rebels are in Boonville with eighteen pieces of artillery; have captured a steam ferry, and are pushing a force to the north side of the river. General Fisk states there is
