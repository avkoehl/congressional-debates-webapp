Major-General BROOKS:

SIR: Some of the scouts that were out have brought in 2 rebel prisoners-one first lieutenant, William H. Tindall, and Private Alexander Hughes. Our cavalry that have been feeling them attacked them out here, in the rear, about an hour ago; the rebels had scattered in retreat, when my scouts picked up two of the. They say General Morgan is along. Their force, about 600 or 700, very much disheartened, have scattered in all directions, but will meet somewhere back, they say about Summitville. What direction they will go cannot say, but will inform you when I learn which way they are going.
