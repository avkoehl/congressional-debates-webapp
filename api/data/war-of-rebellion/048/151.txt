Please send the infantry by brigades as fast as possible. Let the artillery follow at leisure. The great point is to have troops at Stevenson and Bridgeport, to secure those points and the railroad. We can hold this point if we can keep up communication and supplies. Hurlbut must secure us from an advance from Rome by Governor Brown.
