You have not yet telegraphed your positive decision as to whether you will attack or not. General Meade waits here for it. He cannot decide upon his movements until he hears from you. If you can, meet General Meade at the point opposite your headquarters.

P. S.-If you are positive that you will not attack halt the troops coming up at once.

Dispatch received. As far as I can learn the enemy's artillery is still in position, and I hardly think it practicable to attack their line with my available force.
