Major-General SHERIDAN:

I reached Clark's Ferry, on the Staunton River, last evening and shall cross the river at 6 6 a. m. on my way to Danville. If you have any further instructions please telegraph me to-night. From the information gained from deserters and others there would seem to be no doubt but that Johnston has surrendered to General Sherman. I expect to reach Danville on Thursday.
