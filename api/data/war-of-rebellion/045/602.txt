HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS,In front of Middletown, Md., July 8, 1863-9 a. m.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:

GENERAL: Two divisions of my corps and the artillery are now in camp at this place. The other will be here shortly. General Sedgwick requested me to state that two divisions of the Sixth Corps will follow the First Corps. He thought the artillery of the Sixth Corps and the Third Corps entire would consume at least all day in getting here. This delay has been in consequence of the extremely bad roads over the mountain.
