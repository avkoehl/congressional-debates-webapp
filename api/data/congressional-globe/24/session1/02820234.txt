THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 8,
do an act so vitally injurious to the citizons of these
States, of which, at the time of obtaining the ces-
sion, it gave no intimation' Ho would appeal to
that sense of justice which inhabits eveiy honest
man's bosom, whethei such a proceeding would
not be glaungly unjust5 When the citizens of
this Distiict acquired this property, they did rt
under the sanction of existing laws. To deprive
them of this propel ty now would be a violation
of their constitutional rights, unless compensation
weie made,and that compensation Congress pos-
sesses no power to make When the Constitu-
tion provides that private pi operty shall not be
taken for public use without compensation, he
(Mi G ) understood it to mean that, wheie an
individual owned property which the Gov ei nment
needed for its own use, it might be taken, and the
owneiship might be changed, and that which
belonged to an individual might theieby cease to
be bis, and be owned by the Government But
it certainly cannot be a sound or safe consti uction
oe the Constitution to say that the public tr*asm e
may be exnemlcd for the visionaiv purpose of
buying slaves to make them fiee Besides, these
petitioners whol'y mistake their object, as has
been shown already by the Senatoi fiom New
Hampshire, [Mr Hlbeard ] Were Congress
to giant their petition, there would not exist a
single slave less, although much loss might be
produced to the ovvnus, and miseiyto the slaves
Weie Congress to attempt to pass such a law,
with a probability of success, evciy slate would
be immediately removed out of the District to
Virginia and Maiylard and thefuither conse
quences would be, that the slavts would be sold
to strangers and sent to distant parts of the coun-
try, v here they would be less happy, and be
depnved ofmany of thecomfoits and associations
they now enjoy
Mi G asked what would be the condition of
this District when all this should be i fTccti d ' It
would then be a habitation and harboi fin fiec
negioes and fugitive slaves fiom the States of Vn
gima and Maryland It would bo vvhollv unfitfor
the seat of the Geneial Goveinm nt, and those
who aie now uigmg those pe titions w oald find that
weie they to suereed in their wishes i ot one of
tho ohj"cts desired by them woulel be accomplish* d
Mr G proceeded to say that ignorance 01 aw tnt
of knowledge of the subjects on which men act,
had at all tnnesdone moie mischief than anything
else These Abolitionists sty thev an Uiefiicnds
of the slants, arid that a punciplc of pliilan'hiopy
pnmpts tin m to a t the part they ait pcrtcuming
Let the effects aheady pioducd upon the "lues
by then efforts be examined, and ¡t will be icvdily
discerned that they have produced mm h injuiv to
theslavis themselves Befnie the y commenced
thin doings, pious mm and women in dim lent
parts of the slavclioldmg States felt it then duty
to attend Sunday schools established for the in-
struction of slaves, to learn them to lead the Scnp-
tuics a id become acquainted with the histoiy of
man's íedcmption Theie weie separate places
of worship established, wheie lea lied and pious
ministers ofthe Gospel dispensed the woid of truth
to them All of these arc now abandoned and
broken up, and m addition the piivileges of the
slaves arc curtailed,and restiamts imposed upon
them, which never would have been thought of had
these Abolitionists never commenced their labors
Wheie peifect and entne confidence existed,jeal-
ousies and distiust now prevail, and liberal and
kind indulgences have been changed into neees-
saiy and rigorous restraints This his been len
dcied indispensable by the mteifeience of these
men, who aie wholly ignorant of the true relations
that exist between mastci and slave in the slavc-
4 holding; States If these mini would only leflcot
that our slates are bettei fed, better e'othed, and
more h tppv and contented than thousands of their
ow n poor m ighboi s, and would e onfin  their acts
of I eneficenci to those neaierto them, they would
do less mischief and add much more to the sum
of human hapmncss Thesi Abolitionists seem
to think that ittsaiehgiotis duty tointcrtcre with
this subject The Scriptuies aflord no warrant
for such an oomion The Prince of Peace, who,
w hen on earth, reproved men of all sm, and v ho
countenanced nothing wicked, at no time enjoined
t on m as't rs to liberate then s' tv es Slavery then
exist"d,and v itii. i hijknow ledge, Mi-mnihiiiou
rigorous form than it now does, and he taught
slaves to be obedient to their masters The teach-
mgsof these Abolitionists arc, in effect, (although
without the design,) to cause slaves to cut their
masters' thioats Mi G said he must believe
that it was a want of knowledge as to the true
state of things m the slavclioldmg States, which
had produced this misguided zeal, and that so
soon as the tiuthcame tobe fully understood, the
whole scheme of abolition w ould be abandoned
as unprofitable and mischievous Mr G said
he was stiuck forcibly with the chaiactei of these
petitions They were mostly signed by women
and childien Artful and designing men probably
had obtained then signatuies to these memorials,
to which they would not affix then own names
Sunday schools, the best institutions m the coun-
tiy, had been resorted to, and signatuies obtained
doubtless by false representations
Mr G said he mte nded not to be tedious, and
would theiefore, proceed directly to an examina-
tion of the question moie immediately before the
Sen tte He differed fi om the Senator from South
Caiolina [Mr Cu.nocx]as to themannei of treat-
ing this petition He should adopt and pursue
the opinion acted upon by the Congress of the
United States m 1790, ancl which had been sub-
stantially pursued fiom that penod down to the
present Petitionssimilai tothepicsent,and fiom
the same society, had be en picscnted to Congress
at each session, and Congiess had, at no time,
refused to íeeeive them, and a deputuic fiom the
oidinaiy usage on this subject, he apprehended,
might pioducc, íathei than allay, excitement It
would be leeollected, that by tue Constitution of
the United Stati s Congiess is exoressly prohibit-
ed fiom mtcrf ling with the slave tiade which
might be earned on by the citizens of the different
States for the space of twentv one yeais, yet in
1710, the Society of Qaiakers or Friends foi warded
their p< Ufion to Congiess, piaymg their mteifci-
cn^o upon th "it subject This petition, although in
dn ect opposition to the Constitution, w as i eceiv ed,
and a motion w as made to send it to a committee
I This vv is opposed, mil ipioposition made to lay
it upo i the table Those most opposed to the
object of ti e petition sustained the lattei piop-
I osition Mr Madison, of Vngmia, a slate-

I mfei that all, oi at least some, of those who vote
toi the reception ot   the petition are ftvorablc to
its piaver, when m fact there is not one Senator
here favorable to it
Many Senators have declared thdr deti muni-
tion m opposition to tins petition, and at the same
1 time have declared their conviction that the Con-
stitution requues them to receive it     Gentlemen
■ who think tins may seem to favoi the memori-
alists, when theyare,aecoidmgto their own judg-
I ments, only complying with a constitutional obh
I gation    If the Senator fiom South Carolina w ould
j v  thdraw his objection to the reception of the

of tnis bo ly mi0ht hr  obiau cd for rej cting- its.
ptayer. A vote of that kind wou'd discounte-
nance and discouiage the Abolitionists, and give
confidence to the citizens of tne slave holdn  
States, and as so mu"h has been seid on this sub-
ject, he (Mr G ) was desnous that the opinion
uf the Senate should be fully expressed bv a vote
upon the mam question The Senators fiom the
North have told us they will abide our fate—that
they will hazard evei y thing to secure to us the
guarantees of the Constitution in lclation to this
species of property, but they tell i s, at the same
time, that neither they noi thei, constituents en-
tertain opinions upon the -> lbjc-t ot tl e g eat light
of petition which wotnd justily them m r iusing
to receive this oi any othci petition cjuclieel in
decoious at d lcsjiictfi 1 li igifge, that weie they
to vote not to i ceive the petition, they could not
sustain themselves at homo, and the Aboht omsts
would thereby obtai i an advantage over them.
Mi G svid he would ask whethei it w is tight or
reasonable for Senators of the slavclioldmg States,
when they weie asking those of the non s'avehold-
mg States to wage a war with the Abo' Uomsts,
who were their neighbors, for the secui ty of the
propei ty of the South and Southwest, to aim their
adversaries with dangerous weapons and theieby
enable them to conquer then friends' So fai as
he was concerned, he would aid the A'ool tionists
with no vveapo l or aigumcnt which they could
use successfully against the fuends of the Union
and the Constitution Therefore, if there were
no constitutional doubts existing, he would, as
a matter of expediency, vote to receive the peti-
tions, to be followed ap by a vote iijectmg their
prayer But he confessed that the constitutional
light to refuse to receive a petition was very far
fiom being cleai The light of petition existed
befoie the formation of the Constitution It was
wellunderstood by thef ameis of that instrument,
and although it only declaies that Congress shell
pass no law to pietuit citizens from peaceably
assembling and petitioning foi a rediess of griev-
ances, it never could have ente led into then mi ids
that those to whom the petitions wc e addre cd
would icfus" to lecene them Of what vahe is
the light of petit on u tho i to whom petitions
are addi ssed will not leeeive them and act upon
them? The fiameis o' the Constitution lemem-
beied that the Paihamcnt of Great Bntai i had
passed laws prohibit ng citizens fiom assembling,
consulting, and petitioning for a lediessof gnev-
ances They recollected the acts commonly called
the not acts, and theiefoie they mseited the pio-
vision contained in the Constitution, but it never
enteied into their mi ids that petitions, wh"n
signed, would not 1 e received by those to whom
they weie addi e ssed
It is t matte i of veiy little eonsequei c" to cit-
izens that they aie p rmitted to assemble and
petition for a rediess ofgnevances, if, aftn they
have done so, then petitions arc not to be leceived
or consideied bv those who have the power to
art upon the subject matter of the petition I o
his mind these aigaments were too saong to be
disiegaided, and he was unwilling to give the
Abolitionists the 1 cnefit of the n At present they
have no foundation on which to stand They
aie givi ig way to thopicssuie of the public miel
ligence in tue non slaveholdmg Sta es But if we
skill enible them to blend the light of petition
with their abolition schemes, they may raise a
stoim which will shake the very foundations of
this Government
Fiom the year 1790, down to the present day,
all petitions have been leceived by this body
which were rcsp ctful and decorous, whatevci
the subject-m ittei of the petition might be, and
ateveiy sc^sio i the petition of the Society of
Trie rids, clothed n similar 1 tnguagc with tho
piesen* one, has been received Mi G w ould
notdepaitnow fiom the established us-ge He
eonside ed the icccption of the petition, and the
rejection of its Driycr, as the strongest rours"
against abolition that coald be adopted It would
unite more v oices and com ey a clearer expres-
sion of the sentiments of the Senate than any other
mode hat could be proposed, and would there
fore ope ate asa greate diseouiagement to those
who weie engaged in this wild and unconstitu-
tioial scheme of at wishing slaveiym the United
S ves.
