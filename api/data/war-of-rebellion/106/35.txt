A very large proportion of the above are peaceable and well disposed. They are under the immediate control and direction of agents and employes of the reservation and require very little, if any military protection. One company is amply sufficient for that purpose.

Second. Settlements, &amp;c.: The principal settlement near this post is at the Noyo Mills, one mile distant. It employs from sixty to seventy hands at all times, and consequently is amply sufficient for its own protection. Mendocino City, ten miles south, is the next nearest settlement and needs no protection other than its own citizens can afford. One company is all-sufficient for any exigency which can possibly arise between the whites and Indians of this section.

Third. Distances, roads, &c.: I have no method of ascertaining the exact distances called for. The following approximation is probably as nearly correct as can be obtained without actual measurement, viz:

Miles.

From Fort Bragg to Shelter Cove. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 60

From Shelter Cove to Keoska Creek. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10

From Keoska Creek to Upper Mattole. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30

-----

From Fort Bragg to Upper Mattole. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 100

From Fort Bragg to Whipple's, trail good, especially at low tide, when, by following the ocean beach, some six miles of sand hills can be avoided. Two rivers, both easily forded at low tide, intersect this part of the route.

DISTANCES, ETC.

Miles.

From Whipple's to Beall's Ranch (good upland trail). . . . . . 8

From Beal's Ranch to Usal (narrow mountainous trail,

very rough, but passable for pack trains). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18

From Usal to Bear Harbor (very rough and mountainous,

but passable at all seasons). . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 22

From Bear Harbor to Shelter Cove. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 8

Good trail (at low tide by the beach two miles); by the

upland trail (rough and mountainous) additional distance. 4

From Shelter Cove to Upper Mattole (good unpland trail). . 30

The whole distance can be made in from five to six days by pack trains (quicker in summer than winter), and by an express rider in from three and a half to four days. Good grass and fresh water are abundant at convenient distances along the entire route.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. MOORE,

Captain, Third California Volunteer Infantry, Commanding Post.
