Colonel HIGGINS,

Green Spring:

Dispatch just received from Colonel Wilkinson says that a messenger just in from Greenland Gap reports that McNeil had gone to occupy Mechanicsburg Gap. If this is so, it is to prevent the approach of a force from that direction, while the main body would assail New Creek. Has your scout returned that went out with Harris after his brother's body? Have you heard no rumors from Romney or above?

Brigadier-General.

New Creek:

Hold the regiment ordered to Martinsburg till further orders. Put your command in the best possible condition for defense. Keep fully advised. I will send a cavalry scout up Patterson's Creek from here.

New Creek:

Send the company at Fort Pendleton twenty axes, with orders to blockade all the roads and paths thoroughly east of that point, so as to prevent the passage of troops or citizens from the New Creek Valley to Fort Pendleton, or any other point toward Oakland or Altamont; also, advise them of this rumor and direct them to be on the alert.

Colonel WILKINSON,

New Creek:

If you have not already done so, you will assign Captain Holmes' company of artillery to man the guns of the fort. See that your troops are amply supplied with ammunition. I have sent a cavalry
