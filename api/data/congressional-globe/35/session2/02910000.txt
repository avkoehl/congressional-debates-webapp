Now, sir, let me ask the detention of the Sen-

ministers touching this question; and first, I will

31st March, ltff/3.

Hero i.3 the Biitish cons'us general wntir,^ a
diplomatic note to the Captain Oeiieral of (Julia,
under instructions from Lo/<j Clarendon, an-
nougciug to h;m the failure of the promise made
bv Groneral Yaldcz, that ereru negto vnporird into
Cuoa b'tdcc 1320 bcf,eL. If ovi authority
foi the position which we take rosrcJ only here,
it would certainly he pulHcient to arouse the at-
tention of this country. Who can contemplate
this contiitinit of things in tbe Island of Cuba
colmlv? ^ 1S there a patriot who does not
shrink from the Africanization of Cuba—a term
which vividly recalls the unutterable, horrors of
St. Domingo, and which embraces within its ample
signification murder, rapine, and desolation; and
lives there a man, honored by the American peo-
ple by their confidence h^re. ""vho would for a
moment hesitate to interpose all the power of this
Government to avert from Cuba, from our age,
and our race, so dark, so sad a fate?
In 1841, England endeavored to establish a
British tribunal in Cuba, with power to decide
the status of the negroes making application to it.
Lord Aberdeen, in a dispatch of 31st December,
1343, to Mr. Bulwer> then British minister in
Spain, holds the following language in iclation to
this attempt, and its temporary abandonment:
ii In 184L the diaitof a convention wa~ tiant-inilted to
Mad) id, In which it\\a0 piopo-td to ni-tuute, by the "aai
ot Ihiu-h iunetionaue.-, an examination into th'% fitU^hy
which (he ilarc population Of Cuba ts hvui ui \ei t Uudc. Kn-
couiajed by the novel appeatance of good Until on the pait
of the Government of Cuba, as it was then admimnoted.
her M:\ie-~t\V Government admitted the wvighi ot ceitam
ohjei tion- i.n-t d <i£;.i!n>t that proposal b\ the Coveimiient
at ^Tndnd. and loiebosc lor the time to pre&> it.;'
The "draft of a convention" here reffu'red to
had for its object an agreement between Spain
1 and Great Britain that British functionaries should
: proceed to Cuba, <\o upon the plantations, call the
negroes before them and determine for themselves
the titles by which they were held, with the view
! of liberating all introduced since 3620; and to this
! humihating'proposa! Spain lent a willing ear, atid
■ s<yit it to Cuba, to ascertain public sentiment theie
upon it.
It produced an indignant remonstiance from ;
the Cubans, and it was temporarily laid aside, but :
not nbandoned.
The Count Villanuera (who was then Inlen-
dente) said:
H is not to he pi.'sumed thai anv wh.te man will be dis-
posed to inbuilt to haul a tan- 'j'bv'\ \\ ill pieier to enn

In and Ifsjl, these demands were again
pressed by England with great eneigy and wnrmih,
, but were now insisted bybpam. (hi the 23d of

Here I will close my review of British dis-
patches on this point, observing only that, in 1833,
England and Spain seem to have atrived at a con-
clusion mutually satisfactory, suddenly and un-
expectedly; for conflicting dispatches were writ-
ten on the same day by the ministers of both.
On the 15th of March the Eat! of Clarendon
writes to Loid Ilowden (at Madiid) that the po-
sition of {Spain "endangers the friendly relations
between the hvo countriei;" and on the same day *
■ Loid llowden writes to the Eati of Clarendon
that the "Spanish Government has agreed to a set-
tlement of a /juestlon -which has so long been a matter
: of painful divputt."
As yet we know not the details of this ((set-
tlanait," but Lord John Hussell, on the 4th of
May following showed that they were satisfac-
tory to England, and from the couise adopted
towatds un, we arc just! fu.<! in behoving that they
embr.icfd Franco. When we rejected the over-
tuioh of England and France to become a party
to tic tripaiitie trenty, Lotd John Russell di-
n cted the liriiihh Minister liorc to say, that—
<• Wh-'e ndei'i'ii!" lully the n-jlit <•( the Cnncd Prates to

And subsequently, Lord Clarendon, as Sccre-
tM y ibi i-'oieign Affaiis, announced in Parliament
that:
! <•> TP •; e j- no pot turn of the two hemispheres with repaid
to whe'h ilit poiiev oi the iwo eountiie"-, however heieto-
loie aniiiii'-ii!- le- i- m>t now in entnc luumony
' And ii"\v, mi, can we, in justice to ourselves,
' hesitiiie to <vt pumipily ui ou this long cherished
Cuban ns f Tion : Arc \ve to await the final act
of the 11.iev proL.rosruti2^ m Cuba, tne eiYWinei-
■ tiuuou of tne oes, and the revival there of the
. l" f te s of St. Domingo ?
Aie we to fold our arms and permit England
and France to on ct Cuba into a fiee negro colony ?
i Sir, \ am aware that men still live—nay, some
i may be ioanfi even within these Halls, who pro-
■ less to ictMid the negro's ability to govern hmi-
I; self asa quesiion jet to be solved, and who affect
!' not to see tljis question in the light which historic
■ truth has shed upon it. Let me invite their atten-
. turn to the pnsent and prospective condition of
' tho PriMsh colonies.
Gieat LhiLtin lias shown no little solicitude to
iiseu tcvsn the ro.d state of things m her West In-
dia colonies, l-'or this purpose she appointed,
m i a select committee, consisting of some ut
the uiO'd nrohiinent members of Pailmmeut, with
Lord Stanley at their head. In another
committee was appointed by her, with Lord
G< or^e Dentinek a-, its cijairman, to inquire into
the condition of her Majesty's East and \Vest
India ',o^o3«iuLS and the Mauritius, and to con-
-idi-r whether any measures could be adopted for
thdr relief. Tiie report of both committees show,
hcvond all'doubt, that unexampled distsess ex-
isted in the coiomes. The report of 1846 declares:
••Tl ac manv eMnte« m the ihtti^h U'e-t India colonic*
