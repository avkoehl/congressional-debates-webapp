he observation, under the rubbish and antiquated
abuses of the British paper machinery, that had.
been introduced in this country, at a very early pe
nod, after the Government had gone nito opera-
tion. The more that the obscurity which surrounds
them is removed, by discnssion and investigation,
the more bright and valuable these great prm-
cip'es becorre Like a rich and inexhaustible mm?,
the more it is explored, the more its valuable trea-
sure"? reward the researches of the laborer
Another consideration, not less entitled to « eight,
in a eons'ltutional point of View, against deposit-
ing the public money with the banks, is, that, «hen
done, it is with the perfect understanding, on the
part of th  Government, that the money deposited
is to foim a fund, to make discounts to individuals
on Such, unquestionably, has heretofore been one
among the leading inducements of those who hav e
favored this policy, in addition to the other objects,
of keeping and disbursing the public revenue, con-
templated by it Equally certain was it, that the
banks themselves, who received it, did it with the
perfect understanding, on their part, that they were
at liberty so to make use of it, and which was,
doubtless, the strongest, if not the only motive, in-
ducing them to take it Now he could not see any
authority in the Constitution, granting to Congress
pow er to lend the public money, or to authorize
others to lend it If Congress could authorize the
banks to make loans of the public money, they
could, in virtue of the same power, authorize the
Secretaiy of the Treasury to open a loan office
iv itn the public funds, and tnus enable an oflicei,
who cho^e to use them for corrupt purpose;,, to
lend them out among favorite, or those who mignt
proffer die greatest political subsen íence The
Constitutioi gives to Congress the power to
xa se ironey, to effect certain specified purpo-
ses, wuch aie enumerated in that instrument
The power to raise money, fot the purpose of
lending it, is nowhere given, and, consequently, is
not one of the legitimate pmpos.es to which it may
be applied The conclusion, then, is very fairly
to be drawn, that the deposite of the puolic money
in banl ing coiporations, to be used m that way, is
an applieat on of the public money not warranted
bv the Constitution, and, met generally, proving
alike disastious to the individuals borrowing it, the
baiks which lend it, and the Gov eminent which
tnus per nits its lev cnue to be used
Mi B «aid that the gentleman fro 11 Massachu-
setts [Mi Weuste",]had, with his usual ability ,
endcavi red, but most unsuccessful!} , as he believed,
to maintain the proposition, th tthe administration,
in bringing foi ward the present measure, had aban-
doned all control over the question of the currepcj,
and, mdomgso, were refusing to fulfil a mostimpoi-
tant constitutional du'j lie diffeied mos* ma-
tTiiillj, Tilth fha* g< n fieman, both as to the significa-
tion of the term " currencj," when used in rela-
tion to Fedeial legislation, and, also, as to the ef-
fects of the measure en that question, if carried
into practice He contended that the term cm-
rency, whennsedm íeferenceto paper mone>, was,
in that sense utteily unknown to the Constitution,
and the attempt so persev enngly made to interpo-
late t into that instioment, was but an effort to
transpHnt into tins cc anirj, the doctrines and no-
tions aemed fiom the political economists oí Eng-
land Lo used the word currency as applicable
as w ell to paper money there, as to oihei kinds of
monej, because their Government, possessin-* un-
united powei, had, by its laws, so Heated and re-
«yiisedit A tcim, therefore, which, under the
broal povveis of British legislation, was made to
comprehend every kmdofpapet monei, could not,
with pio,n etv or accuracy, be used here, to ex-
plain aw a /the well defined powers of our on n
limit d C institution The word currency was
nonh"rt t< be found m any provision of that
nistiumtnt, but the word "money" often ottuned
in it Whu it meant, and that the Government
of the United Stpt'-s wis intended to be a hiid
monej Government, fhewoidsof the Consti'ution,
plain and PTplicit in themsel.is, and the cotem-
poraneous vi imngs and cucumstances of that da> ,
prov ed, beyond all mannei oí doubt
The Constitution giv es to the Federal Government
the powei "to com money, regulate the value theieof,
and of foreign com " By the words used, we are
left in no doubt as to the signification of the word
"money," as here uspd, and that it was intended to
establish a hard money currency by the framers of
the Constitution The term "money" being used
m ú is ense, m that pan rf the Constitution just
quoted, and which is th  fr-t place in that instru-
ment m wh ch it occurs, it necessarily has the same
Signification aflixed to it, in all the clauses of the
Constitution that it subsequently occurs in The
Constitution having conferred, in express terms, the
entite control over the hard money currency of the
country, as a consequence, which clearly result?
fiom that grant cf power, had denied to the Go-
vernment authority to establish any other kind of
money, as a currency, fo  no mie has been more
universally conceded, by men o' all parties, than
that, in construing the provisions of a Constitution
of limited and de!«2a td power , when a power in
relation to any one subject is expicssi} gianied, '
that a 1 other power in respect to it, net giarttd, is
in effect, denied By this rule, then, which is an
admitted one for testing the meaning of the Consti-
tution, the Government of the Lnited States is ae-
nied the pow er to establish or to authorize, the esta-
blishing of, any thing else, as money, except that
which it is expresslv empowered to do, and is, con-
sequently, without the power to create a paper cur-
rency
If, however, any doubt still remained, as to the
power of the Government to establish a paper
currency, that part of the Constitution giving it
power to "provide for the punishment of counter-
feiting the securities and current co il of the United
States," must effectuall}   remove it and settle tre
question  acainst  such  poviei      according to the
rule which he had Id d dow a a'reid} , in construing
the Constitution, that the giammsr, by e\.Dres  pro-
vision, a po «er in leiat c tr an one =ubject «a
in effect, a denial or any other 11 luitne" pj   er, in
respect to it, than that granted, it followed that  ro
authority existed in  ihc Federal Goverumei t to
punish for any other descrintion ot counterfeiting
than that mentioned m the provision he had cited,
and, by consequeace, that the Government has no '
right to pass a law to punish the counterfeiting of
notes, either of a bank of its own creation,  or of
State banks     Now, if the Constitution gave  no
authority to  Congress to pass laws to punish the
counterleitmg of b-inli notes, (and that it did no', '
was, he helieved, the opinion ot some of the most |
eminent statesmen in our coantiy,) could it be be-
lieve1  foi a single moment, that it ever wps the I
intention of its frameis to give tne Goverrmeu the '
power to establish a paper currcnev, or any oth r   j
than the "ctmení coi i,'   as a c training medm n,   |
which it empowers Consress to lunish the countei-   |

powei to protect its it venue tiom frauds   i   o.n oi '
the raost essential «Sfetafe  of all welfr*egtjiated
Governments. To preteW tie money which it
receives, as revenue, from i ag counterfeited, is
one of the most important means of preventing
such frauds, yet the GovernmBSt.'if it receives the
paper of the State banks, is entirely powerless to
its protection, m that respect. Whetiwr rt was
intended, when the Constiltition was formed that the
Government should receive paper money «f any
kind, m payment of public does, he repeated, ad-
mitted «f great doubt.
Looking beyond the arguments drawn from a
fair interpretation of the Constitution itself, the his-
tory of the times, preceding its adoption, might,
with safety, be appealed to,m confirmation of such
opinion. One of the great, and almost overpower-
ing, difficulties which the old Congress, under the
Articles of Confederation, had to contend with,
was the depreciated paper money of that day. If
he did not err in his recollection, the letters of
Gen Washington, addressed to the Continental
Congress, teemed with complaints of the embar-
rassments which he experienced in defending the
country, in the war of the Revolution, occasioned
by depreciated paper money To check this evd
w as afterwards among the most powerful conside-
rations urged in behalf of adopting the present Fe-
deral Constitution.
In  the forty-fourth number of the essays, to
which he had before referred, written in favor of
its adoption, the writer of that number, (who was
Mr Madison,) after treating on the propriety of
conferring on the Government the power of regu-
lating the coins, and the necessity of prohibiting the
emission of bills of credit by the States, dwells on
the " pestilent effects of paper money on the neces-
sary confidence between «van and man, on the ne-
cessary confidence in  the public councils, on the
industry and morals of the people, and on the eha-
i aclei of Republican Government," thus confirming,
bj   these strong expressions, as to the pernicious
tendency ( f the paper system, the belief that the
framers of the Constitution never intended to re-
cognise it, in any shape,  as a constitutional cur-
rency     Ir was, also, a part of the history of the
times, to which he had referied, that, in no parti-
cular, was the system of policy, at that tune pre-
vailing m England, more oditras to the people of
this country, than, on facconnl of the abuses practi-
sed, under the system of exefftsrve pnvikge  and
monopolies, which were fostered by that •govern-
ment.    Can it, then, be believed, that the patriotic
men, who had just successfully earned theconalry
thtough  the  war  of independence, intended   to
adopt, in he Constitution formed by them, one of
the most oduus features m the policy of the coun-
tn, psamst iv h chihej had successfully contended,
bj p'acmg the Government unler the control of
responsible banking corporations, as to the receipt
of its dues, and the management of its fiscal arTairs?
H" repeated, that the circumstances m which the
Constitution  originated, the concurrent history of
the times, and the obvious meaning of the instru-
ment itself, all went to repudiate the construction,
now sought to be given, to the powers of the Go-
vernment,  on this Question    It was the Senator
from Massachusetts, and his political friends, who
vi tie foi abandomrg all control over the true con-
sti iuional currencj   of the country     It was the
S nator, and his  po'itical friends,  who were for
destiovmg the only true standard of value, driving
the Government irom its " moorings," and em-
baiung the \e-sel of S'ate, freighted with the best
h( pes - nd 'enrest interests of the nation   on the
deiei ful and *empestuous waves oí th  papersystem
AIi B sMd that it was his most sincere and
sol ran conv iction, that the great question now at
issue, involved in it the libertv and independence
of t ie counirv It is a question of no less impor
iice, than uheth-n the people shall con'mue to
°-oiern themscnes, oi w bethel the> shall quietly
íesign thems°hes to be governed by bank mono-
nohes What, sn, s-nd he, do we hear iiom all

Why, that the revenue of the Government must
be given up to them, or that the Administration
must be expelled irom power 1} is demande 1, ir 
language bold and insolent, and the pnce ot re-
