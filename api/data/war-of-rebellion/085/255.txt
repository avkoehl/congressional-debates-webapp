SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 19, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK,

Saint Joseph:

What are the operations to date, and what prospects of clearing out the bushmen? One hundred and thirty men crossed the Missouri to the north,near Dover, supposed to be Todd's men, on Friday last. I do not want those men of Harding's mounted. I will send more cavalry to you soon as mounted.

The force that I reported was moving east Friday under Todd crossed the Missouri River Friday below Dover, attacked and cut to pieces a camp of thirty militia, seven miles from Lexington, in Ray County, Sunday evening, and moved east toward Hardin afterward.

Brigadier-General.

CHILLICOTHE, [September] 19, 1864.

General FISK:

A band of guerrillas, about seventy strong, came out of Ray County yesterday morning and passed through Carroll yesterday and last night. They passed within one mile and a half of Carrollton, and camped about four miles from Carrollton. Pursuit made from Carrollton at daylight this morning. Think there is no doubt but the militia overtook them before they crossed Grand River.

Colonel.
