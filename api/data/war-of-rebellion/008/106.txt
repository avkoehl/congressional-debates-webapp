creditable to themselves and our command, this being the first time ever under fire.

I regret to state that we lost 1 man killed from Company A, of the Fifth Iowa Infantry; one arm broken in Company I, of the same regiment; these being the only casualties worthy of notice.

HDQRS. FIRST BRIGADE, SECOND DIVISION, Army of the Mississippi, March 22, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by my brigade in the attack upon New Madrid on the 7th instant:

Being ordered by Major-General Pope to repair with my brigade to a point in the rear of the upper part of the town of New Madrid as near as could be reached without being expose to the view of the enemy and there await an attack to be made by General Stanely, with his division, upon the lower part of the town, and until he should have drawn off the troops form the upper fort and all the gunboats, with the exception of the one anchored at the mouth of the bayou, just above the upper portio of the town, with a view of then attempting to drive off with my riflemen the gunboat from the position then occupied and effect a lodgment of my brigade within the trenches of the upper fort, having arrived at the point designated by Lieutenant Kelly,of the United States Cavalry, who was sent by General Pope as aide and guide, my brigade was formed in line of battle, and skirmishers advanced. I then awaited the attack by General Stanley. As soon as he commenced firing upon the enemy they commenced throwing shells into the woods occupied by my troops, evidently expecting the main drawing the enemy's fire to the lower part of the town, as expected, it brought tow boats from the lower fort in addition to the four gunboats lying at the upper fort when the attack was commenced. I then ordered a forward movement of my brigade with a view to co-operate with and support the left of General Stanley's division. My skirmishers soon fell in with the Sixty-third Ohio Infantry, of General Stanley's division, and my brigade was halted. General Stanley himself soon appeared, to whom I reported. He, deeming it utterly impracticable to make a successful assault with the gunboats in the position then occupied, ordered a forward movement of my brigade, with a view to co-operate with and support the left of General Stanley's division. My skirmishers soon fell in with the Sixty-third Ohio Infantry, of General Stanley's division, and my brigade was halted. General Stanley himself soon appeared, to whom I reported. He, deeming it utterly impracticable to make a successful assault with the gunboats in the position then the woods, and sent to headquarters for further instructions. Whilst waiting for these the enemy continued to throw shell over us. Upon the return of the messenger I was ordered by General Stanely to return to camp. This was done in perfect order by the troops comprising the brigade, the enemy in the mean time continuing to fire upon us.

I am, sir, very respectfully, yours,W. H. WORTHINGTON,

Colonel, Commanding First Brigade, Second Division.

Lieutenant WILLIAM C. RUSSELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
