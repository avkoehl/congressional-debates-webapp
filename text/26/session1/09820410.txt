The seventy ot the commercial crisis ot 1 37
a'l remember, and it is ■« ithin tl e uc 1 ect on oi
nos  who «ere in the lasi Cobres-., tiat at ih'
eitra ses nn th^ causps cf th s crisis aeie very
lreqnently descanted «u Comrrurcal dfficilties
pervaded near'y the whole world, at d when Oppo-
sition orMors ascribed all the evils afflctngour
community to the removal of the deposites, the spe
cie circular, and sundry oiheractsot the President,
it wat repl ed that ihese disorders were not confined
to this country, but pervaded otner commercial
states. Attempts were then made to ascnbe rot
only the commercial d sas'ers o! th s country, but
tbo^e of Ei g and and the whole world, to the enor-
mities of President Jackson. The s.milanty oí the
v.ews advanced by ceitain gentlemen tf the Oppo-
sition on this floor, with tho^e contained in an arti-
cle in Blackwood's Magazine, must arrest our atten-
tion and >tnke us with some «urpnse. In that Ma-
gazine, for August, 1837, there is an article head-
ed—'-The late commercial ciisi*.—the work of the
tyrant majority "
After giving a description of rum and dis're s
pervadingG> eat Britain, equalling the most glowing
panic speech ever maáe, the writer proceeds:
" But if these have been the effects of the storm in the British
islands, how incomparab y more disastrous have been us
effects on ihe other -ide ol the Athntu' In America a con
vulsion has been experienced, unprecedented perhaps, in the
civilized worl I It may truly be -aid tint an uruver-al bank
ruptcy has there taken place
Further-
"We shall find the cause in the msanilv of the American
Democracy in the violent stru££le between the con ervati\e
and levelling principle, of which, for four jears that country
has been ihe theatre, in the monstrous absurdin of the Irishes,
who by Ion  con inued lamor and vi ilence in opposition to
the united opinion ol all the wealth, respectabilitv nd mtelli
gence ofthecoun ry. ensaned the Executive in a strusrsle for
life and death with the commercial and Intel eaual an« i iac>,
and at leng h carried their Democrat c jea )u=v «n far as,

tmna—self government and universal educaton—have termi

through, amid the unarirmus shouts of the  wbc e Republican
Barty m America ihe following dec s.ve measure1- aga n«t the
mted States Bank, intended as a prelude to the war against all
banks whatever "
The writer then enumerates Ihe removal of the
deposites—the veto en the Bank charier, and the
specie circular, a> the measures, producng the de-
plorable results described.
"It was the great ait of Democratic despotism by the Ameu
can mas-es which has thrown the whole nor dinto convulsion,
and induced an extent of rum and sufjlmg forapaiallel to
which we shall search the annals of regal or aristocratic op
pression in vain '
The writer also gives U as his opinion—
"That the banker with his rntes has doñeas mjch for the
cause of freedom, as enher the printer with his printing press,
or the schoolmasier with his grammar
He also says-
"This extraordinary and otherw se inexplicable lea'ousy of
the Bank which bv combning solidly with prulerci in its
measuies has do~e so much to rem ive the inherent tit srer of a
paper currency when issuing fr >ni a mulmu le of ndepen len1
sources, is in mith nothing but he form which D mociatic am

which may som°ttme? counteract and interfere with their
despotic propensities "
And again:
"Previous to the elec ion of Gen   lacksoti, the redera' sts had
always   exercised   a   certain   influence   over  all the  Presi
dents who were a ways scholars, ni d who had all,  whatever
their party might be, connections of fanily, friendship orear
ly habita With the conservative ranks     Up to his accession to
power, that party had always a sort of control over both cham
hers    Now, howev< r, this is entirely atan end   the Executive
18 wholly at the dis, nsal of the Democratic party    1 he Fede
ralists have no influence whatever except in one of'the cham
bers and that is the Senate, where their preponderance is still
maintained from the superiority in its ranks of intelligence, edu-
cation and fortune    The Democrats, in consequence have not
failed to desienatethe Senate with the title q( aristocratic body,
and to ca'l it tin House ol Louis The i la 5 which in Euripe

The wr ter also q lotes in support of his posi-
tions the fol'owing extract from the work of a
French trave lor
' l 11 ler the moderate tnd bentficent rule of fo m^i Prcsi
dents, ihe public functionaries were not clnn°ed on the change

the pub'ic elections Since the election of Genera! Jackson,
however a vstematic system of exclusion has been a iopted,

that the bread of themselves and their ptmilies depen Is on up
holding the ruling dominant powers The President has now
under his command an army of sixti thousand civil servants,
thev are his ames dañinees "
Let it not be understood that Iamso illiberal as to
impute to all my political opponents all the senti-
ments entertained by the ¿nglish Conservatives.
I am «peaking of the tendency of the principles,
and the course of the two great parties of this
coun'ry That there are in the courtry a cons de-
rable number of persons who are opposed not only
to Democratic, but even Republican institutions,can
hardly be doubted. Wuhin the fold of which
party they arr- tobe found, the tendency of the dec-
ir nes entertained bv the respective parties, may
serve to indica'e Were not the^e indications suf-
fi-icnt, refeience might be had to the productions,
which have at several times appeared in the pub-
1 c p-ints, and among thp rest those of a writer
who s gned himself S dney, published in 1837. He
says-
' Ttmthe imm'diat" cause of the pres-nt derangement of
the curiencv and of the embarrassments of commerce and
manufactures is the ignorance, perversity, or wrong headed
ne«sof a few men in the Administration is true, but that the
primary causes are to besought in the Constitulion, is a fict
too obvious to admit dispute
'There aie two prominent reasons to be assigned for these
defects in the Constitution One is the want of experience m
tne patim ic men who fiamed the C onsti'ution The o her is
the credulous relia ce of these men on the virtue an 1 mtelli
gence of the people and of the men who should be electedto
enact laws and admin ster the Governtrent
' These opinions are not th" visions of theory they are sns
tamed truths absolute facts and such facts have indu ed i a
Uonsto abandon the practice of electing' tneir Chief "Magistrates,
preferring to receive that office bv heie luary succession Men
have found that the chances of having a gnnl nrnzistrate by
birth are about eqtnl to the cha ices cf obtainin" one by
popular election And boast as we will that the supemrin
tel igenct of our citizens mayienler this Government an ex
ception, tune will show that this isa mi°take ¡So mtion can
bean exception till the Almighty ran change (he whole cha
racter of man "
May I ncl say that theie is a s'nking similarity
between some of thes°numents put forth in tne
conserva'tve Enslish journa', from which I have
quoted, and those we have heard, and still hear,
on this floor? That the banker, with h's notes,
has done so much for freedom, is not entirely at
war with some assertions- made here. What the
writer's ideas of freedom are, may be sufficiently
inferred from the ten9r of his article. The army
of sixty thousand office holders—the veto on the
Bank—the removal of the deposites—the specie
circular—the putting fo^th of these as the effi-
cient oau«es of a'l the embarrassments which per
vaded the world—the complaint that the Presi-
dent is responsible to ihe people, "is ihe man of
their choice, their rran^atorv, their servant," and
other sugge tiors which I will not enumera'e—are
they not all familiar 'o our ears?
In enumerating other and further proofs of a
tendency to irr«ponsible power, there is the Bank
coinention, which met a year or two since, to re-
gulate the busimss of the nation, and which held
its sessions with closed doors. With their enor-
mous power, what was this but a secret and ir-
responsible Legislature ? When any thing has
been suggested against the Bank of the Un ted
States, it has been replied that the directors were
respectable men, and they would exercise properly
their power. The opposition to the Independent
Treasury is nothing less than an attempt to give
the keeping and control of the revenues of the
country to irresponsible corporations instead of en-
trusting them to the safekeeping of responsible
agents of the people. Notwithstanding it is ímposa-
b'e to deny the abusesof the banking system, and no
one does deny them, jrt when an effort i-, made to
pre.ent tho*e abuses, it is lmtnediptelv denounsed
as an attack on the exiting institutions of ihe coun-
try, and the doctrine is proclaimed that the "banks
are the people." Who defended the gro«s attempt
in Pennsylvania to c'othe with power persons
not elected by the peopV? And sir, the
maioiity of ihis House his been denounced
again and again as disfranchising a State' And
wh}? Because, exercising the power given to
us by the Constitution, we refused to admit in-
to this hall, as memb°rs, those not chosen by the
people Those coming here and claiming the ex-
ercise of undelegated aiid irresponsible power, did
not pretend lhat they had a majo ity at the ballot
b ixps. They came In re confessing that they hod
not. And yet, because we have admitted to their
seats those who had a majority at the polls, and
because we d d not admit those whTn the people did
not elect, to exercise power here which the people
never gave, we have Leen denounced ' If the popu-
lar will could have been thus defeated, ih're might
have been home reason for a di>trust in the perma-
nence of our institutions. I have already alluded
to the remark of the gentleman from Tennessee,
that ihe people have been for years "mere ma-
chines," and his assertion that confidence has di-
minished and is dai'y diminishing in our institu-
tions. It is true that in the preceding portion of
his speech, the gentleman fiom Tennessee pro-
fessed himself not to be in favor of any further
limitation ol the right of suffrage. Butcouli there
be a stronger argument in favor of such limita-
tion' If ihe mass ot the community have been
ftr years "meie machines," can (hey ex rcise the
right of suffrage as freemen oughi? Such a doc-
trine strikes a deadly blow at the right of suffrage
I utterly deny ihe fact, that, for years, ihe people
have been degraded to the rankuf "meie ma-
chines," and that they are so devoid of intelligence
by which to know, or spirit by which to maintain
their rights, thit they can be hoodwinked and led
huher and thither. And any party that undertakes
to act on such an assumption, will find themselves
covered with defeat and disgrace.
But, let me ask, does it become ns to be too
ready to proclaim tha* confidence is daily diminish-
ing in our insutuiiors? Who does not know that
the hopes of the true í'iends of lieedom ihroughout
the wo/ld are fixed on us? H ther do those who
cower under ihe oppressions oí the old world turn
their aching eye?, gazing Irom afar, to the Und of
promise Who does not kno-v ihit the foes of
ireedom watch with ea^er earnestness for the
slightest symptoms ot doubt and distiusf Every
such symptom is magnified and repeated again
and again by every journal of Irgt'imacy across the
water . Ir it is to be published that the great ex-
periment hab failed, and that the problem of s lf>
government is never to be solved, how glad will be
the tidings to the foes of popular power' If it be
true that already there is ion for distrust in our
insiitutions, those who, in all clime:, have been
struggling to maintain the rights of their fellows,
may well cease their effort , and fold their hands in
despair.
In alluding to the partiality of the Opposition to
the irresponsible vote by ballot oí representativts
of the people, the rtmark is due to the gentleman
fiom Massachusetts, [Mr. Cüshino ] tnat in oppo-
sit o i to his couise in this rtspect in the last Con-
gress, he at this sfSsiun boih spoke and veted
against it. Nor do I go loo far in asserting that
from the admissions made by him on this floor, an
interence can be drawn as to which party is mo<t
in favor of popular rights. It is a rregnant fact
that he has heretofoie lelt himself obliged to rebuke
his friends for thcr avowals here that there was
any reason for increased disgust in our popular in-
stitutions. On one occasion, I understood him to
admit that perhaps there was a leaning to ultra
Conservatism among his political associates, and
at the same time to contend there was on the other
side a tendency to ultra Democracy. In his speech
on the Treasury note bill, he also observed it was
"his fortune or misfortune to differ with many of
his political associates m regard to the social orga-
nization of the people of the United States, and the
