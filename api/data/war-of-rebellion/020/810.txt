General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

A large force is reported to be landing at New Berne. As no forces are moving from the North the force must be from you front. If this information agrees with yours army I ask that you make arrangements to return the troops sent from Washington to you recently?

Memoranda of disposition of guns in Third Military District.

POCOTALIGO, March 4, 1863.

The guns intend for Ashepoo River, one 12-pounder rifled and one 24-pounder howitzer, are not in position, for the reason that after the battery was built an additional battery was ordered to be built by Captain Echols to receive the rifled gun, and a requisition made on the engineer department at Charleston for labor to do the same, which has not been received, and because there was not infantry or artillery company
