Major General FRANZ SIGEL, U. S. Volunteers, a witness, was recalled.

Question by the COURT. Look at the papers now shown to you, marked, respectively, Numbers 1, Numbers 8, Numbers 15, Numbers 16, Numbers 17, Numbers 18, Numbers 19, Numbers 20, Numbers 21. Are these papers the original orders or communications, or true copies of them, referred to in you testimony?

2. From Major R. O. Selfridge, being general orders, dated Headquarters Army of Virginia, Warrenton, August 25, 1862.

9. From Captain Heintz, aide-de-camp, to Major-General Sigel, dated August 28, 1862.

The witness stated that the two communications from Captain Heintz were originally in German and that the copies read are true translations.

The foregoing papers are appended to the proceedings of this day in the order in which they were read.

Question by the COURT. Look at the four maps now shown to you. State whether those maps indicate the localities and position of the troops referred to in you testimony of operations from the 27th to the 30th of August.

Answer. the maps marked 3 and 4 can only be approximately correct. In the map marked 2 General Schenck's division should be somewhat to the left, and the distance between the divisions of Schurz and Schenck is a little too near; but in general the map marked 1 is correct. The map marked 1 represents the position of the different corps as intended by the order of General Pope on the 25th of August.

The map referred to in the foregoing are appended to the proceedings of this day, and marked 1, 2, 3, and 4.
