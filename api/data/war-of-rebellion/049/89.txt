I send you a copy of telegraph sent to you at 10. 30 p. m. last night, with request to answer. I fear you have not received it:

The major-general commanding Army of the Potomac wishes to know upon what road the troops opposite Falmouth were moving, and upon what road the trains were moving south of Fredericksburg.

Please answer.

GENERAL: Nothing from General Kilpatrick this morning as yet. General Gregg reports all quiet and no changes. General Merritt reports that there has been perceivable change in front of Rappahannock Station -

No movement indicating withdrawal. Their line continues the same and about the same strength as when the entire division was there.

Very respectfully,

The troops appeared to be moving on the Bowling Green road, the wagons on the Bowling Green road and the telegraph road. A column of cavalry was moving on some road farther south but parallel to the Bowling Green road. The signals flag was seen at 5 p. m. 3 miles south of Fredericksburg. Three deserters will reach you by noon with valuable information.
