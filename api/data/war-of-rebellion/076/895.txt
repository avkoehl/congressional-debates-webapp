send 1,000 cavalry to your assistance. Should you finally be forced back, form and strengthen yourself upon the right of our infantry, which is now being extended to the railroad.

Very respectfully,

A. P. MASON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,July 20, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: General Hood desires you to form a portion of your cavalry on the right of the infantry, holding the remainder in readiness to strike the enemy in flank in case they should attack General Cheatham. He sent you a note to this effect, and sends this to say that he does not wish your entire command formed on the right. He also desires you to keep them from General Cheatham's front as long as possible, and use every precaution to keep-them from our flank. He wishes me to say also that your own judgment will prompt you when it may be best and at what point to strike the enemy in case they should attack General Cheatham.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

E. B. WADE,

Aide-de-Camp.

General WHEELER:

Are you driven back or have you only fallen back to find a good position? What is your estimate of the enemy? Hold at all hazards. General Smith, with all the reserve artillery, occupies the works behind you.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I have 700 men here in the trenches upon the right and left of the railroad, supporting the reserve artillery. There is nothing to my right.

Very truly, yours,

G. W. SMITH,
