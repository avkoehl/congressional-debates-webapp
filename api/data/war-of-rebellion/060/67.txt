mitted that Batchelder's Creek fight was about as hot as they ever had it from the dammed Yankees.

Private Robert B. Vanderhoef, U. S. military telegraph operator at my headquarters, deserters mention for his promptness and correctness, and who, after sending my last dispatch, coolly took up his instrument and jumped with it into the last train while it was in motion.

I do not deem it necessary to mention more minutely than I have the brave, calm, and implicit obedient conduct of all my officers, and the men seemed actually to enjoy the contest, and any enemy that undertakes to surprise any pickets of the One hundred and thirty-second New York will find his work very difficult.

After arriving at New Berne the One hundred and thirty-second New York reported, agreeably to General Palmer's orders, on the right of Fort Rowan, where they did their regular duty with the other troops, until the happy order to resume our old position reached me. Report of casualties is appended.

I have the honor to be, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. J. CLAASSEN,

Colonel, Commanding Outposts.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
