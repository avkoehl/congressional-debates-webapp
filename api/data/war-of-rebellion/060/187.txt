Colonel Dahlgren had not failed in crossing the river, which he did either through the ignorance or treachery of his guide, or had the enemy at Bottom's Bridge been forced to remain at that point by a threatened attack from the direction of Yorktown, I should have entered the rebel capital and released our prisoners.

The expedition failed in its great object, but through no fault of the officers and men accompanying it. All did their duty bravely, promptly, and well, and for which they deserve the highest praise.

I will forward at the earliest possible moment a correct statement of my entire loss of men, animals, and equipments, as well as a nominal list of the killed, wounded, and missing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Captain F. C. NEWHALL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps.

CAPTAIN; I have the honor to forward herewith a tabular statement showing the losses of the command which accompanied General Kilpatrick on his recent expedition.

I have the honor to state, in addition, that the inspections made of these troops discovered a large number of horses rendered unserviceable form sore backs and overexertion. There are of these, in the First Division, 180; in the Second Division, 200; in the Third Division, 100. All the animals, of course, are much pulled down by the unavoidable fatigues and hardships of such an expedition, and all require recuperation before the renewal of very active duty. The health of the men of the command was not unfavorably affected by this expedition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,F. C. NEWHALL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

Captain E. B. PARSONS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
