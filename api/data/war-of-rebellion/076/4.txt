FRANKFORT, KY., July 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have just been relieved from the command of a gallant division in the Army of the Potomac at my own request, because most of the corps commanders were my juniors. Gladly as I would serve under you, yet I do not desire the command of a division in an army where I have commanded a corps and where most of the corps commanders are my juniors.

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw,. July 1, 1864.

General CRITTENDEN

Frankfort, Ky.:

I think you make a great mistake in declining a division, which is a major-general's command. You could not expect a corps commander to be removed to give place to you. Still, you had the offer of a good division, which is now withdrawn, and General Thomas says he has no other command to offer you.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw, July 1, 1864.

A. ANDERSON,

General Supt. of Military Railroads, Nashville:

I hear Mr. Taylor, the new superintendent, spoken of very highly. Bear in mind that these are war times and all must incur some risk. We here will do our share, but if the road or wires to the rea rare interrupted the repair must come mostly from your end. Keep Colonel McCallum advised that he must be prepared to lose half a dozen or more trains every month by guerrillas and dashes at the road which cannot be prevented.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, July 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

We have made and continue to make large preparations for contingencies, loss of trains, and the like. We receive five to eight new engines per week and average over thirty cars per week. In July the number of cars received will be much greater. No pains, effort, or expense will be spared on our part.

A. ANDERSON,

General Superintendent.
