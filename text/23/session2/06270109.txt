Mr K insisted that the spoliations which
were the subject of the bill had caused a war be-
tween the two countries—a war, to be sure, of
limited duratio i, but still a publ c war, by which
the claims were extinguished The acts of- a hos-
tile nature passed by Congress in 1798, had all
just been read oi leferied to by his friend from
New York, the most matenal of which were those
authorizing the caotuie of the aimed vessels of
Prance On the 98th day of May, in that year,
Congiess passed an act authouztng the aimed
% ts^els of tne United States to capture any armed
vessel oi Fiance which had committed depreda-
tions on oui commcice, oi which might be found
eiuising about oui coasts foi tl at purpose This
act has been called defensive, barely in its charac-
ter Admit it to beso, (said Mr K ,) and what
is to be said of the act of 9th July, 1798! Tnis
act authonzes .the captuie of Fiench armed ■* es
seis anyd-here on th"high seas In other words, it
authorized a general maritime war with Fiance
And did these acts (inquired Mr K ) end m
idle ceremony'   Not at all, sir    The Presidert,
as authonzed, issued his proclamation to carry
them into effect, and fiom that time the armed
forces of the two nations understood perfectly
well the hostile relations in which their íespective
nations stood to each other, a id acted accordingly
When then ships met, they instantly clcaied for
action, some of the most dcspeiate conflicts en-
! sued—then masts weie cut off by tl e dexterity
of ourgunneis—their hulls were shatteied into
useles<! floatmgwiecks—then decks were drenched
' in the blood of th" r seamen—conquered, cap-
tured, cained into port, confiscated, sold, and
I distributed as prize     And yet, gentlemen say,
I there was no war in this' The Sena'oi from New
Yoik, who had just taken his seat, nrefeningto
this state of things, asked if it could be called
peace'    " Certainly," he wasans\, ciedfrom the
seat of the Senator from Massachusetts     " Cer
tanly," we may call things by what names we
please, but, in natuie, they aie not changed by
tl e names we arbitrarily give them     We may
call a dec'aiation of war a proclamation of neu-
trality    We may call a challenge to mortal con
flict a love lettei, or a billetdoux     Or a bloody
war may be called, as in this case, "a mere mis-
understanding "  Yet these things would remain
unchanged in their natures and consequences by
the names assigned to them
But (inquired Mi K) why is it that those
hostilities, cam d on by the authority of the
Government, did not constitute war' lie knew
not w hat reason the Senatoi fiom Massachusetts,
f\lr Web_ster,] who was to conclude this dis-
cussion, might assign, but other Senators had
assio-ned no°othei leason than tint " the negoti-
ators sa d theie had been no war " Tncy might
as well have "said" that time never was a
flood They might as well have "said" that
the battle of Wateiloo was a faerdly salutation
between the contending ai mies Their sayings
could not change war into peece But the tiuth
was, (said Mr K ,) the Fiench negotiators,
when the claims were fiist presented, "said
there hid been war, "and that any mdiffeient
nation would say so," and that consequently,
" no indemnities could be claimed
It makes but little difference, however, (said
Mi K ,) what these gentlemen said in the polite-
ness of their diplomacy, stnung to foiget the
past,  and   mutually  seeking  the  advantage  in
i  ¡evmng an extngushed  t tat y     M     Vattel
said, \v iei he wiote his book on the Law of
Aations,  that " w «  is th it s a e m which we

teniber, 1800, had no elaiiK  ihJi ut could iiith
technical nght insist on   and Fian-    ne^ei sui-
rendeied this nsht to disclaim them, oj offered to
suuender it, unhss upon te  ns she thojgl t aa-
^alltageous to her
Gut it was said that if these claims wne evtm
guisned bj wer.tleyweie icw\  d by negotia-
tion     Mi  K inquned how the> eould-L   iciv a
by mpre negoHatioat   The envoys could not re-
vive an extinguished claim by merely insisting
on it, or taking it into notice in negotiating a
treaty.   They might as well have undei taken to
revive the edict of Nantz     it.was a matter they
could not control uithont the approbation of the
ratifying authouty     It was of  no consequence
upon what pnnciplc they negotiated, but we should
inquire upon what principle the Senate i atified
But it is said they were lecogmzed as a subject of
negotiation in the second aiticle of the tieaty.
Veiy well, sir, and did the Senate ratify the sec-
ond aiticic'   Not at all    Then fust act, when
the treaty was piesented, was to pat the sponge
upon it    They said, m effect, let the second aiticle
be blotted fiom the instrument    Could the Sen-
ate have disclaimed moie emphatically the notice
which had been taken of the subject'   The ne-
gotiatois had taken the sub eet into consideration,
and it was neccssaiy to dispose of it     They,
theiofore, said in  the second article, that "not
being able to agiee" upon the subject, tb y post-
poned it to a moiecon client time     Theiecond
article expunged by the Senate, the tieaty was
sent back to Napoleon, and what did he do'
Why he agreed to the retrenchment of the sec-
ond aiticle, "provided"—-provided what, sir'—
that the respective nations w ould pay the ciirams
of their citizens íespcctivcly'    Not at all, sn
He nevei thought of such a th'ng     For Trance
had nei ei  paid its ci'izens foi  the claims they
weie at the same time setting up against us    But
he agreed to the retrenchment of the second ai ti-
I cle,proviaed each paity íenounced the iespectrve
" pre tensions which were the object of the second
amele "   " Pietcnsions" was a -veiy slighting
I term to use in íefcience to a valid debt    The
| pretensions in his mind most likely were the
| claims of mutual guaranty, and the pnvilege of
I neutrals, but whatevei they were, this was only
another mode for disposing of them as not sus-
tainable     So we see, sir, that the ■>atifyingpoiotr
acted oi the pimciple that the claims were extin-
guished by hostilities, whatevei  the negotiators
maw have said or done in the matter
Mr K said that, after the second article was
expunged, the matter stood precisely in the pre-
, dicament in which it would have stood if the
claims had not been noticed in the tieaty And
he supposed it wo ild hardly be contended that if
national hostilities had existed, and peace restored
by treaty, without noticing claims which uen the
cause of hostilities, that these claims would not be
extinguished
But it is said our own envoys alleged that this
class of claims was due, and insisted on its pay-
ment Certainly they did, sir, and on many
things else they di 1 not obtain He understood
his friend fiom Maine, [Mr Sheflet,] who dwelt
on this circumstance, had much of the confidence
of his constituents as a lawyer as well as a poli-
tician If so, ho would ask his fnend if he had
not often insisted stiongly that thousands were
due to his client when he knew theie was notdue
to him one cent' Doubtless he had, and did only
his duty in doing so The Go\ernmcnt and
envoys acted on'a similar principle 1 hey were
representing American citizens, and they did the
best thej could foi them but not being able to
i íecovci indemnities from Trance, it was a little
hard,their \eiy diligence should be used as a
reason for chaiging the United States with the
claim                                                 _       ,    ,            ,
But it is further said that the Trench also ac-
knouledgcd these claims Yes, su, (saidÍ Mr
I K ,)and Inw d d they icknow ledge tl em> Ihey
I aeknow«cd, d them, il« iy¡  coupled w Li a con
dition that would at tne same time extinguish
them Ti ey would ncgot at- for the payirent of
these claims, piond'd we would íeiiie an extin-
guished treaty, nil allow them to put then own
price on its supposed obligations Wnat kind
of icknow'cdgniLnt\ as this' and they certainly
ne-iei made any othoi You sn, (said Mr fi. ,;
make claim on me foi ten millions o. dollars
Vut well, I m« safcl5 answer, " youi account
is a false oie, but I will acknowledge it, if you
will peimit mc to p iduce a false leceipt foi it

cicely examined, of this nature, for they weie
