HEADQUARTERS FOURTH ARMY CORPS,Buck Head, Ga., July 19, 1864-8 p. m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: In accordance with instructions, General Wood made a demonstration this a. m. along the Atlanta road to Peach Tree Creek. Generals Newton and Stanley at the same time making a reconnaissance with a small force on the roads to the left. The enemy was found in considerable force and well posted. His works covering the bridge were carefully constructed intrenchments. As soon as I received the order from your headquarters dated 9.15 a. m. of to-day, I ordered General Wood to force a crossing. This he did very handsomely, driving out a brigade of the enemy's infantry and taking possession of his rifle-pits. He took about 30 prisoners. General Stanley effected a crossing of the North Fork of Peach Tree Creek, extinguished the burning and repaired the bridge. Casualties of the corps about 20 killed and wounded.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
