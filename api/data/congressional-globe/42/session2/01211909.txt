I understood the agreement to be that that
should not be done.
The SPEAKER. The Chair understood
the gentleman from Connecticut [Mr. Stark-
weather] to say that he would waive that
right if it could now be agreed that the pre-
vious question should be seconded and the
main question ordered on this bill.
"Mr. STARKWEATHER. I desire that if
on Monday next two thifds of the House want
to pass this bill they shall have the oppor-
tunity to do so.
HOMESTEADS FOB SOLDIERS, ETC.
Mr. HAWLEY. I ask unanimous consent
to have taken from the Speaker's table and
referred to the Committee on Public Lands
the bill of the Senate No. 447, to enable
honorably discharged soldiers and sailors,
their widows and orphan children, to acquire
homesteads on the public lands of the United
States. I make this request because the Com-
mittee on Public Lands is next on the call of
committees, and by referring this bill to them
now they will be able to consider it and be
ready to report it when called for reports.
The SPEAKER. That requires unanimous
consent.
Mr. STOUGHTON. I object. A bill of
that same character has been referred to the
Committee on Military Affairs, and is now
being considered by that committee.
Mr. SPEER, of Georgia. I call for the
regular order of business.
The SPEAKER. The regular order is the
motion that the House now adjourn.

RELATION OF TARIFFS TO WAGES.
Mr. EINKELNBURG. Mr. Speaker, when
the House was last in Committee of the Whole
upon the President's message, the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Ivelley] made an
argument in defense of the present tariff upon
the general plea of high wages and justice to
the laboring classes. He depicted in glaring
colors the low vvages, the misery and want to
be found in European countries, contrasted
them with our own, and argued that the present
rate of customs duties was the only barrier
which protected the American workingman
against a similar state of things in this coun-
try. I regret that the daily routine business
of the House has prevented me from giving
this subject, the relation of tariff to wages, the
attention which it deserves, but having the
opportunity to-day,-1 desire to submit a few
remarks in reply.
If is the old argument that a tariff increases
the wages of a country, and that the tariff is
for the benefit of the laborer. My purpose
to-day is not to enter into any lengthy theo-
retical arguments on this point., but before
proceeding I will just express my firm belief
in the fundamental rule which is recognized
by the highest authorities in the science of
political economy, namely, that the rate of
wages in any country is regulated by the pro-
portion of laborers to the labor-employing
capital or wages fund of the country, the
former being the divisor, the latter the divi-
dend. and the quotient representing the aver-
age rate of wages; or, in other words, it is
the common piinciple of supply and demand.
This rule is liable to exceptional variations
here and there, but it is the great basis upon
which the whole subject rests.
That wages are not the willing creatures of
tariffs, as the gentleman from Pennsylvania
would have us believe, but are regulated by
circumstances wholly foreign to the tariff, is
evident from the following facts, to which I
invite the attention of the gentleman from
Pennsylvania. Wages have been uniformly
higher iu this country than in Europe from its
earliest period to the present time, whether
tariffs were high or low, in times of high pro-
tection and comparative free trade : and even
in colonial no-tariff' periods American wages
were much higher than those of Europe.
Wages have always been and are to-day much
higher in Canada than in England, although
free trade exists between the two countries.
Wages are considerably higher in Sngland
than_ on the continent of Europe, although a
free interchange of the products of labor has
gone on for more than a quarter of a century.
Wages in England are rising froih year to year,
and are rising with astounding rapidity at the'
present time, all under a system of free tr^de.
wages have always ruled higher in the Mis-
sissippi valley than on the Atlantic, slope;
they are higher on the Pacific than they art;
in the Mississippi valley, and higher in. the
mountainous Territories of the West than thijy
are at all the other points I have mentioned ;
all this with the most unrestricted,intercourse
between those several regions. If these are
facts, and I assume that the gentleman from
Pennsylvania will not dispute the correctness
of any of them, I ask him whether it is not
evident that a higher law, which laughs at
tariff acts, regulates the course of wages, that
there is such a thing as supply and demand in
wages as well as in everything else, and that
as long as ours is a new country, with its pop-
ulation fat below the number adequate to the
development of its immense resources, as long
as we do not arrive at the proportion of num-
bers to square miles which prevails in the
countries of Europe, our wages will and.must
be higher, and this whether your tariffs are
high or low?
But while it'is true that wages in this coun-
try are and naturally must be higher than in
Europe, and the condition of the laboring man
is better here than there, I protest against
the gentleman's repeated heartrending de-
scriptions of the condition of European and
especially of English labor, which he generally
winds up by charging to the effects of free
trade. The condition of England is infinitely
better to-day under its system of free trade
than it was under the protective regime, and
is improving at the present time with a rapid-
ity unexpected by the most sanguine fiiends
of the free-trade system. Tho gentleman
refers to the number of paupers in England.
Has he forgotten that dreadful declaration
made by Mr. Fox, when a member of Parlia-
ment, when he said it was a melancholy and
alarming fact that the great majority of the
people of England, an enormous and dread-
ful majority, were not in a condition in which
they could live by the produce of their labor?
That was protectioa. To-day, after a quar-
ter of a century of free trade, the paupers
constitute less than, five per cent, of tlae pop-
ulation.
In 1819, the per capita consumption of tea
in Englaud was one pound thirteen ounces,
in 18G7 it was three pounds ten ounces ; sugar
was consumed at the rate of twenty-four pounds
per capita in 1849, and .forty-three pounds in
18G7 ; wine, 0.22 gallons in 1849, and 0.45 gal-
lons in 1807 ; tobacco, one pound in 1849, one
pound five ounces in 18G7. Dots that look as
though the present financial system of England
were a failure? One thing more ip this con-
nection. Mr. John Noble, in his book entitled
' โข The Fiscal Legislation of Great Britain," thus
describes the condition of that country just
before it changed its policy from that of pro-
tection to that of free trade, that is, when Sir
Robert Peel came into office :
" Every interest In the country was aliko de-
pressed; in the manufacturing districts, mills ana
woikshops were closed, and property daily depre-
ciated in value; in the sea-ports, shipping laid
up useless in harbor; agricultural laborers were
eking out a miserable existence upon starva'ion
wages and parochial reliet; the revenue w as iiiMil-
ficient to meet the national expenditure ; the coun-
try was brought to the verge or national and uni-
versal bankruptcy.''
Is such the condition of things in England
to-day ? It is easy to select exceptional cases
of hardship which have lately attracted the
attention of English philanthropists, as the
subject of cbiJd labor in the brick-yards of
England, which forms the theme for a recens
