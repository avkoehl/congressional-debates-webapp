would be brought into unpleasant collisions; to
avert which, Congress passed a law in the year
1820, to reduce the pnce of the public lands to one
dollar and twenty-five cents per acre, and requiring
cash payment therefor, and providing that those
persons who had purchased lands under the credit
system, or became the legal holders of certificates
of parchase as aforesaid, should bs permitted to
relinquish to the Government «he cerüfloates of
purchase of those on which full pa>ment had not
heeli made, and to apply the part so lelmquished
Hi completing payments for other lands by them re-
tained.
From the 30th June, 1820, it has been the
policy of the Government to sell her lands to pur-
chasers at private entry, at one dollar and twenty-
five cents per acre, after their having been ofieiéd
to the public for sale to the highest bidder at public
■vendue. Since the adoption ot the present land
system, various schemes have been proposed m
regard to their future disposal, but no one ef the
schemes that have been proposed to change or alter
the present system, has received the approbation
ot Congress. The extinguishment of the natioi al
•debt having been finally accomplished, and the
pubhc lands being no longer needed as a source of
revenue to the General Government, it would be
an act of the greate-t possible injustice toward the
new States to tax the people of tho^e States m the
purchase of the pjbl e land*,, merely for the pur-
pose ot raising a surplus revenue, to be distributed
ararai? the sevi-ral Stales, a project certainly never
«cntempiated b> tup sete-nl compacts between the
States and the Geneial Go vert men t, by vhicn
these lands b( came the common piopei ty of all the
States oí the Ui icn
Previous io the final extingu sririent of the na-
tional deb', the íevenue which accrued to the gene-
ral Government irom t> e sales ot the pubnc lands,
•and that umch was received fiom dunes imposed
upon foreign merchandise, was held and used bv
the Government as a iund to " pay the debts and
to provide for the common defence aid general
welfare of the United States " It de es not seem,
therefore, that an\ good reason can now be given
in favor of separating these two great sc-uices of
pubhc revenue to the Government A graduation
and reduction ih the price of the public lands has
3ong beeri a ¡ ubicct of the greatest possible solici-
tude with the pe< pie of the new States, as may be -
seen by reference to the various and numerous pe-
titions, memorials, and Legislative reso'utions,
■which have, from time to time, been presented, and
pressed upon the consideration of Congress.
The committee are ol opinion that Congress does
not possess the constitutional power to lay and col-
lect taxes merely for the purpose oí ratlin? a fund
to be distributed among the several States of the
Union, nor for any other purpose whatever, etcept
to pay the debts and to provide for the common
defence and general welfare of the United States
When the money of the people shall have been
dra"wa from their pockets by any system of taxa-
tion whatever, it would be impossible for the wis-
dom of man to devise any plan by which the same
■would be returned to each individual from whom
it shall or may have been collected, in the same
ratio in which n shall have been drawn from their
pockets. It would b? unjust, therelore, to tax the
jnany for the purpose oí benefiting the few. Upon
the most liberal view of the subject, ihe committee
are of opinion that the period has fully aruved
■when the pubhc lands should cease to be a source
of revenue to the Government, except f< r the paj-
ment of those general charges w hich grow out of
the acquisition of the lands, their survey, and their
sale.
In some of the land districts, there remains only
the refuse lands, some of which have been subject
to private entry tor a period of from thirty to foi ty
years, and it is not to be supposed that those lands
will be purchased at the present price of one dollar
and twenty five celits per acre ft r many years yet
to corne, it ever. If the lands which remain un-
sold, after having become subject to sale at private
entry, for a period of five years and upwards, were
graduated and reduced m pnce, the consequence
would be that, while the Government ivould be no
loser by such a policy, many an honest pooi man
would thereby be enabled to procure a home that
he could call his own; and the Stales in which the
public lands are situated, would be earlier possessed
of additional sources of revenue to the States re-
spectively, and the still more important advantage
to those States, would be cultivated fields and
green meadows, m the place of an unproductive
forest.
It is a fact well established, that the wealth and
strength of the country are its population, and the l
better portion are the cultivators of the soil, and
whi'e the burdens of the South and East are dimi-
nishing by tne reduction of the duties on the
luTuues oi life, it seems but equal justice that the
chief burdens of the West should be lightened at
least m an equal degree
The immense value that has been given to a
vast portion of the public domain, wnich was
acquired first bj conquest, and afterwards by pui-
chase, has been mamly produced by the daunri^ss
courage and unspeakable sufferings of the hardy
adventurous sons of the West But for the many
pnvations in hie which were encoun'eied by the
eariy pioneers ef the western wilds, the whole
fertile region o country west of the Alleghany
mou itairs, would, until the present day, have re-
mained in unpi iluctive foiest, inhabited only by
savagesard beasts of pley It ¡s a fact woithy oí
the most senous consideration, that althougn the
people of the wvi States of thp West, are sepa-
ri'id from the old thirteen States, by mere geo-
graph cal divis oris an 1 boundary lines, they are ne-
veit'viess brcthrei and felltw Kinsmen, having

annual tie-sage to the two Houses of Congress in

policy that the puohc lands shall cease, as soon as
pidctcible to be a source of levenue, and that

venient time, this macluneiy be withdrawn from

of our Government, foi the lands they iceupv,

lions oi dollars, and of the revenue received there-
fiom, but a small pait has been expended amongst
them When to the disadvantage* oí then situa-
tion in mis respe t, we add the consideration thit
it is then litboi which gives ieal value to the lands,
and that the piooecds arising from their sale are dis-
tributed chiefly aim ng States which had not origi-
nally any claim to them, and which have enjoyed
the undivided emolument arising from the sale
of their oil n lands, it cannot bs expecte I that
the new States w 'I lemam longei contented
with tre niccnt policy, after the pajrnent of
the pubhe <jebt. To avert the consequences
wnich m<iy be appiehended irom this cause and to
put an end for ever to all partial ard uteresied le-
gisl«uon on this subject, and to afford to every
American citizen oí enterprise, the opportunity of
seeming an independent freehold, it seems to me
therefore, best to abandon the idea of raising a
future re\enue out of the public land?" Again,
the present Chief Magistrate m his late annual
"VIessage to Co'igress, takes the following view of
the sprue subject. He says—"A large portion of
our citizens have seated themselves on the pubhc
'*mds without authority, since the passage of the
last pie-emption law, and now ask the enactment
of another to enable them to retain the lands occu-
pied, upon payment of the minimum Government
price    Thrv ask that which has been repeatedly
gianted before. If the future may be judged of by
the past, little harm can b; done to the interests of
the Treasury by yielding to their request. Upon a
critical examination, it is found that the lands sold
at the public- sales since the introduction of cash
payments in 1820, have produced, on an average,
the nett revenue only of six per cent, an acre more
than the minimum Government price, and there is
no reason to suppose thatfutu-e sales will be more
productive
The Government, therefore, has no adequate pe-
cuniary inteiest to induce it to drive these people
irom the lands «hey occupy, tor the purpose of sel-
ling them to others Entertaining these views, I
recommend the passage of a pie-emption law for
their benefit, m connection with the preparatory
steps towards the graduation of the price of the
public lands, and further and moie effectual provi-
sions to prevent intrusions hereafter Indulgence
to those who h¿^" settled on these lands with ex-
pectations that past legislation would be made a
rule fir the intnie, and !>t the same time removing
the most plausible ground on which intrusions are
excusGd, and adopting more efficient means to pre-
vent them hereafter, appear to me the most
judicnus disposition which can be made
of this difficult subject The limitations
and restrictions against the abuses in the
execution of a pre-empt on law, will necessanly
attract the careful attention of Congress, but un-
dei no circumstances is it expedient to authorize
fioatirg claims m any shape They have been
heretofore, and doubtles would be hereafter, most
prolific souices of fraud " In these views of the
subject, the commutee fully concur, believing it
t i ^e trio It tie p >hc of the Government as well as
just to its citizens, so to repul ite the price of the pubhe
donain, asto enab'e ever} pooi man to procure
i h i ne /hieti he can cill his own Sjch a pol cy
would not b alone cmimed to th< peopie oi the
new States Its benefits would be equa ly open to
e\ ery citizen ol all 'he States It is due to the
new ¡states that a liberal policy shoul I be adopted
in Ihe sa'e oi the publr lands withm then íe^pec-
tue limits, with a view to promote their early set-
tVn nt and impiovement
Ii ome of the new State-, wheie the public
lands have been in market upwards of thirty-five
years, there is yet remaining large tracts of unsold
refuse lands, which will not sell for the present
minimum Go vet nment price, by reason of which,
the settlement and improvement of those States
hive been saeatlv letai led, and the States and
the Geneial Government, respectivelj, have been
thereby considerably curtailed in their revenues,
which would have accrued to both from an early
sale and settlement, and consequent cultivation of
those lands.
Under any and every view of the subject m
which h pieserts i'self ioi consideration, whether
as relates to the ínteres' of the General Govern-
ment, or to that of the Slates in which the public
lands are situated, the committee are oí opinion
that he mutual|!inteiest ot both requires that the
public lands should be reduced in price, at a rate
p oportioned to the length of time they shall have
been brought into market and subject to sale at
private entry, and that the present settlers on the
public lands ought to be secured in their settlement
b\ pre-emption rights
The committee reports bills accordingly
A BILL to grant pre-emption rights to settlers on
the public lands
Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Represen*
tatiocs of the United States of America m Congress
assembled. That eveiy actual settler of the public
lands, who was in possession on or before the first
da> of December, eignteen bundled and thirty-
seven, and cultivated any part thereof in said year,
shall be entitled to all the benefits and privileges of
an act entitled " An act to grant pre-emption rights
to settles on the public: lands," approved May
twenty-ninth, eighteen hundred and thirty , and the
said act is hereby revived and continued m force
two jeaiii Provided, That where more than
one person may have settled upon and cultivated
any part of one quarter section of land, each one
of them shall have an equal share or interest m
said quarter section, but shall have no claim, by
