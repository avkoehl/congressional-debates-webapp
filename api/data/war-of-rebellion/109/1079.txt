HEADQUARTERS LONGSTREET'S CORPS,June 16, 1864-12.30 p. m.

[General R. E. LEE:]

GENERAL: I have found the enemy on the turnpike a little below the point at which the road to Clay's and Ware Bottom Church diverges, and am now driving his skirmishers back. It is to be presumed that he has possession of our breast-works opposite Bermuda Hundred. I have not been able to communicate with our troops near Petersburg. if I find difficulty in clearing the road it will be impracticable for General Pickett to reach Petersburg.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

R. H. ANDERSON,

The enemy carried this morning another of the weak points in the old lines. He appears to be concentrating toward our right center for another attack. I am collecting all available troops to resist until night, when I hope to be able to occupy new lines. We greatly need re-enforcements to resist such large odds against us. The enemy must be dislodged or the city will fall.
