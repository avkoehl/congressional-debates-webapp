and inexhaustible coal-fields of Virginia and
West Virginia. These are the most extensive
and valuable, perhaps, of any in the world,
consisting of the ordinary bituminous, the
cannel, and the splint varieties. These coal-
fields embrace an area of some twenty-five
thousand square miles, or about one tenth of
all the known coal area of the world. In many
sections there are successive strata, one above
the other, cropping out in the same mountain
side, aggregating, in some instances, forty or
fifty feet of coal capable of being mined with-
out shafting. So far as I have been informed
they embrace all of cannel-coal and splent-coal
of any considerable value and extent in the
United States. This latter variety is entirely
free from sulphur, and for smelting ores is in
its raw and native condition, as taken from the
mine, superior to coke, and almost, if not en-
tirely, equal to charcoal. I have been informed
that cannel-coal now commands in the New
York market from twenty to twenty-three dol-
lars per ton. I am assured by the officers of
the Chesapeake and Ohio road that when their
road is completed they will be able to deliver
cannel-coal in New York for ten dollars per
ton ; of course, for considerably less in Wash-
ington city, if the connection which I propose
were made.
Nor are the deposits of iron, especially in
that part of West Virginia, through which the
route of this road passes, less abundant and
rich than her coal-fields. It also passes by
•virgin forests of most valuable timber of almost
every variety and almost illimitable extent. It
traverses the entire region of the justly cele-
brated Kanawha salines. And so it will be seen
that the connection I propose with this road
will open to this city, and the completion of
the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad, certain to
be accomplished in a few years, will open to
the whole country these rich resources of coal,
Again, these striking advantages are greatly
enhanced bjs the easy grades and curvatures on
this road. Coming eastward there is, in all the
five hundred and five miles from- the Ohio to
the sea, no grade.exceeding twenty-nine and a
half feetto>the mile, and only ten miles reach-
ing that grade. From the Ohio river to the
base of the Alleghany mountains, a distance
of t^vo hundred miles, there is no grade exceed-
ing^ twenty feet to the mile. The minimum
radius of curvature on this road is one thou-
sand feet, and of this, only two and a half
miles. Sixty per cent, of the road is straight.
Compare these statements with the facts in
relation to other roads.. ' The maximum grade
of the New. York and 'Erie road is sixty feet,
of the Pennsylvania Central fifty-three feet,
of the Baltimore and Ohio road one hundred
and sixteen feet to the mile; and the curva-
ture of neither of these roads is so favorable,
I believe, as that of the Chesapeake and Ohio
road. These are important considerations,
looking to speed, to safety, to economy, and
to the wear and tear of machinery. It would
seem as if Nature had been in a beneficent
mood when she sunk down the grand range
of the Alleghany mountains at the point-where
this road is located over them, and kindly
bent the streams on either side to the same
point, so as to afford a practicable and easy
transit of the coming tide of commerce and
communication "between the mighty Valley of
the;Mississippi and the sea.
In considering the advantages which would
result to this city and District from a connec-
tion with the Chesapeake and Ohio railroad
at the point I have designated it will be inter-
esting and useful to advert also to the char-
acter and productions of the immediate coun-
try through which it passes. In the first place,
it would furnish the shortest, and indeed the
only, practicable means of reaching the rich
iron, salt, and timber—commoditiesso essential
to the comfort and prosperity of all. I beg
leave in this connection to read an extract from
a pamphlet which I have here. The statements
which I read are, I am sure, entitled to full
credit:
" The iron of Virginia and West Virginia is of the
best kind. Its superiority is attributed to the copper
which is found mixed in very large quantity in the
ore, which renders it more ductile and increases its
capacity for resistance and tension. The ores of
' Virginia and West Virginia are fully equal to the
bestSwedish and English. . This fact has been proved
by repeated experiments made by order of the Gov-
ernment tof the United States. These beds of iron
ore and veins of the richest coal are situated imme-
diately onand along the line of this railroad route.
Often the "same mountain or hill contains the salts
for fusion of the metal, as well as lime, argil, and
wood for making charcoal. Thus all the material
for the refinement of iron and its conversion into
steel is found collected together in close proximity."
Now, let me invite the attention of Senators
more particularly to the connections which this
great route mast in a few years necessarily
make with the railroads of the West, South-
west, and Northwest. If you will cast your eye
over the map of railroads west of the Ohio
river you cannot fail to perceive that the ter-
mini of this Chesapeake and Ohio road, at
the mouth of Big Sandy and the Great Ka-
nawha, pointing directly toward Lexington
and Louisville, in Kentucky, toward Cincin-
nati, and so toward St. Louis, indicate beyond
controversy a speedy connection with all the
great national thoroughfares concentrating at
these points.
Now mark how little remains to be done to
uomplele those connections! I have already
stated that from one of the termini of this road,
namely, thatatthe mouth of the greatKanawha,
a route for a railroad has already been sur-
veyed to the Marietta and Cincinnati railroad,
a distance of only twenty-eight miles. The
construction of this short link of twenty-eight
miles will therefore perfect a continuous and
almost direct road from the mouth of the Ches-
apeake bay to Cincinnati, to St. Louis, and,
by the way of the Central Pacific, to San Fran-
cisco, forming connections thereby with all
the intermediate systems of railways ; or, as
you must also perceive, by the other terminus at
the mouth of the Big Sandy an easy and direct
communication by rail may be made with
Louisville. Already there is in process of
construction, as I understand, a railroad from
Lexington, Kentucky, to the terminus of the
Chesapeake and Ohio road at the mouth
of the Big Sandy ; or there might be, and
doubtless in a few years there will be, an in-
termediate connection made with the Ohio
railways by the way of Ironton. Thus it will
be seen that this great'route to the sea, by
supplying a fewshort and trivial links in the
chain, will bind itself to the great system of
western railways and afford the cheapest and
shortest route to the ocean to nearly one half
of the people and commerce of the Mississippi
Valley. I need hardly lemind the Senate how
this road connects itself with thatgreat national
highway, the Ohio river.
A word or two now in reference to the
amendment which I propose to offer. It asks
that a company shall be chartered from the
District of Columbia to the nearest practicable
point of intersection with the Chesapeake and
Ohio road which may be found east of Staun-
ton, in Virginia. It is pretty satisfactorily
ascertained that this connection can be made
by the construction of not exceeding sixty or
eighty miles of new road ; thus shortening the
present railway connections with Staunton by
some thirty or forty miles. This being done,
the capital of the nation will be plated in
direct communication, by an almost straight
line, with Cincinnati and Louisville, and so with
St. Louis and the Pacific railways, and with all
the principal cities of the West, Northwest,
and Southwest. You see how easy it will be,
in view of the facts I have mentioned, to con
summate this great public convenience and
benefit. Doubtless, in the course of two or
three years, the travel and commerce of a large
