CHARLESTON, December 27, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

General Hood desires me to visit Army of Tennessee. Colonel Brent, my chief of staff, at Montgomery, says my presence is required west, owing to some confusion in various matters and want of supplies and ammunition. Unless otherwise instructed I will leave here as soon as I can make definite arrangements for future operations in this State.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., December 27, 1864-11. 30 a. m.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va:

In event of having to abandon the coast, and enemy's movements will permit a choice of base of operations, shall it be toward North Carolina or Georgia? Latter is true base for forces of this department, but views of War Department may require otherwise.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
