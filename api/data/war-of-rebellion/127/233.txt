MONTGOMERY, ALA., April 22, 1861.

Governor THOMAS O. MOORE,

New Orleans:

The three companies with St. Paul's can be sent to Pensacola. The companies offering under my conditional requisitions will not be mustered into service until the call is made absolute.

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, April 22, 1861.

Governor JOHN J. PETTUS,

Jackson, Miss.:

I make requisition upon you for two regiments of infantry, to rendezvous without delay at Lynchburg, Va. Conform the organization as far as possible to the law providing for the public defense. They will be mustered into service at such place as you may designate, and transportation and subsistence provided accordingly. Answer.

L. P. WALKER.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 22, 1861.

L. P. WALKER:

The defense of Virginia is the defense of Tennessee, as well as the whole South, and while I have no authority under the constitution or laws of Tennessee to order troops beyond the limits of the State, and our military organization is very defective, yet I have no doubt I can raise the three regiments for Lynchburg within a very few days, and think it safe to say you can rely upon them.

ISHAM G. HARRIS.

MONTGOMERY, April 23, 1861.

Governor H. M. RECTOR,

Little Rock, Ark.:

If you received my dispatch of yesterday requesting you to furnish a regiment I shall be obliged to know your answer. *

L. P. WALKER.
