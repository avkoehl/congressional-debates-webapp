HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION, New Hope, October 9, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Brigadier-General ELLIOTT,Commanding Cavalry, Department of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: The force I sent to Van Wert has returned. They did not reach that place, but got within a few miles of it. The cavalry of the rebels hold it. They brought to me a citizen having a brother in Cheatham's DIVISION, who lives near here. He passed last night with his brother. He was at Cedartown last night, and says all the infantry and wagons took that road from Van Wert. The infantry commenced moving this morning but he did not learn their destination. Some thought Rome and some Blue Mountain. Hood has a pontoon train with him. I am confident this is the correct report, viz, that Hood's army took the Cedartown road from Van Wert, and all his infantry were at and near Cedartown last night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

K. GARRARD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding DIVISION.

This man was captured near Van Wert, on his way home from Cedartown, which place he left this morning.

General Garrard has been informed that General Sherman has gone to Allatoona, and to send any important information as to the enemy's movements form Cedartown direct to Allatoona.

HDQRS. THIRD CAV. DIV., DEPT OF THE CUMBERLAND, One mile of Van Wert, October 9, 1864 - 2 p. m.

(Received 2. 30 p. m. 11th.)

General ELLIOTT:

I have encountered the rebel cavalry under Ferguson. Ross and Armstrong are on the Rome road and, I think, Stilesborough road. Troops from Van Wert moved in direction of Rome and Oxford. I am having a pretty severe fight. Have gained the mountain this side of Van Wert. A considerable force of rebel cavalry is now moving to attack me. They have crossed the stream the other side of the town. Scouts report none of our cavalry at Dallas, as I was led to suppose. I would not have advanced so far had I known this sooner. It is now 2 o'clock in the day. I cannot withdraw in the face of so much cavalry without a fight. General Morgan's brigade of cavalry, 700 or 800 strong, is at Villa Rica. I am afraid they may attack me in the rear.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. KILPATRICK.
