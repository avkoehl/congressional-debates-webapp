CONFIDENTIAL.] WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, March 8, 1865.

General ROBERT E. LEE,

Commanding Armies of the Confederate States:

GENERAL: My reflections upon our recent conversations induce me to request that you will live me fully your opinions upon the military situation.

Since I assumed the control of the War Department a more extended knowledge has convinced me that our condition is full of peril, and that it demands united counsels and prompt action.

It seem to me that the legislative department of the Government, if not already fully advised, should be thoroughly informed of the present posture of affairs, in order that its wisdom may co-operate in advising whatever further measures shall seem necessary to rescue the Confederacy from its present danger; and this appears to be the more urgent since it is understood that Congress proposes to adjourn on Saturday next.

It is my purpose to submit your views (with my own remarks upon them) to the President, to be communicated to the Congress, if he shall think such a course proper, but in any event I am sure that your statements and opinions will be received with the respect due to your exalted character and great services.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War.
