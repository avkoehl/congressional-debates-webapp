WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, December 26, 1862.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Baltimore, Md.:

You must defend Harper's Ferry with your command. If necessary, concentrate your forces there. Almost everything available about Washington has been sent to General Burnside. Keep me advised of the enemy's movements.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
HEADQUARTERS,Baltimore, Md., December 26, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I received the following last night from General Kelley:

General Cluseret occupies Winchester with his brigade. The rebels are all driven south of that place.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTH ARMY CORPS,Baltimore, December 26, 1862.

Brigadier-General KENLY,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

I will send to Harper's Ferry to-day all the force that I have available and to spare here. It will be six companies of the Sixth New York Artillery, two large siege guns, and Seventeenth Indiana Battery, with six rifled guns and about 100 men. There is so little infantry here that none can be sent away. General Kelley telegraphed me last night that General Cluseret reports himself safe at Winchester. General Cluseret thinks the force in his front is General Jones' cavalry and the Maryland Line. General Kelly will keep the road open to Martinsburg and keep Cluseret supplied.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, MD., December 26, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Following dispatch just received from General Kenly, at Harper's Ferry:

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., December 26,[1862]-1.30 p.m.

Major-General SCHENCK,

Baltimore:

Dispatch received. I am very weak here, and have repeatedly asked General Kelley for more troops. Nothing has been left undone by me; but if the enemy comes in force, I cannot fight him in front of Harper's Ferry, as I have notified General Kelley, but must make defense on Maryland Heights. There are upward of 1,000 sick in the hospital here. I ordered the surgeon in charge, some days, ago, to remove them. The Surgeon-General ordered him to keep them here. They are of serious concern to me.

JOHN R. KENLY,

Brigadier-General.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
