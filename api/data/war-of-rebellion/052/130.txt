Major General S. A. HURLBUT:

The following just received from Lieutenant Colonel J. Morrill, commanding Glendale:

A scout has just come in, and says Roddey, with a portion of his command, was at Town Creek, and on the 21st considerable fighting was heard in that direction, supposed to be an attack from some of Rosecrans'forces.

CORINTH, August 23, 1863.

Major General S. A. HURLBUT:

I send you the following telegram* just received. One of my scouts brings me information that a raid on the railroad is in contemplation, to take effect in or near Pocahontas. This it appears has been talked of for some time, and a large force of cavalry is sent up in this neighborhood from here to Pontiac and Hernando. They say 20,000 have come up, but this is certainly a great exaggeration. There are but few troops at Okolona, a few at Saltillo and Tupelo, and the rest stretched across the country west of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. I believe what the scouts say may be relied on.

August MERSY.

CORINTH, August 23, 1863.

Colonel JOHN I. RINAKER:

I am informed that a raid is contemplated on the railroad either at Pocahontas or some point below. Instruct your outposts to be on their guard, and to keep their detachments together. Give no leave

of absence to any officer or man, and give the order that the water barrels in forts are filled.

August MERSY,

Colonel, Commanding.

Captain JOHN HOUGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN Having assumed command (by seniority), upon the departure of Colonel George E. Waring, Fourth Missouri Cavalry, I deem it my duty to report my situation. I am, as you are aware, encamped at this point. Of the force under my control you doubtless are informed. Upon assuming my command, I found the force very much scattered, to wit, the battery entirely detached from some portion of the infantry, and in a position that in would have been almost impossible to have made it available had any emergency required; also the cavalry in the same condition. I immediately selected a location where I could concentrate all my force, and if required could, in my judgment, if necessary, hold my position against a superior force, of which at the present I apprehend no danger, although I am daily in receipt of information of a large force
