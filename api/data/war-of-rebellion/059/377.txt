BULL'S GAP, April 16, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD, Knoxville:

The rebel families and surgeons last sent beyond our lines are still at Blue Springs, and do not get any transportation from the enemy. They apply for rations, and also to be sent to Greeneville. The roads are bad, and the former trips were hard on our teams, but I think they should either go back to Knoxville or farther to the front. Have you any instructions?

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., April 16, 1864.

Brigadier-General COX, Bull's Gap:

The enemy should furnish transportation for persons sent through the lines from the point where the railroad cannot be used; at all events do not send them to Greeneville until the roads are in better condition. You will have to feed them while they remain with you.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

BULL'S GAP, April 16, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

I have intelligence more reliable this evening from Kingsport that Vaughn and his cavalry went toward Blountsville, going to North Carolina, as they said, instead of crossing the Holston. Jones is at Estillville, 7 miles from Kingsport, with 700 men. Day, with 200 men, did not cross the river last evening.

R. A. CRAWFORD,

Chief of Scouts.

LOUDON, April 16, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourth Army Corps:

General Ammen has arrived, relieving me of command of this post. I will leave here with my command on Monday morning and arrive at Charleston on Wednesday.

G. D. WAGNER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

BULL'S GAP, April 16, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I strongly suspect that the cavalry under Vaughn, which crossed near Kingsport, is making for North Carolina to break up the regiment Kirk was organizing. Kirk was in Knoxville in arrest a few days ago, but on a partial investigation of the compliant I advised its withdrawal. I think it important that he should rally his command as soon as possible.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
