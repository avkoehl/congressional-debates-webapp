General W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Cannot rely upon more than 800 men and a battery of eight guns for city defense. Hope to get more from citizen organizations. Please advise me from what point (Rome, Knigston, &amp;c.) I can rely upon getting accurate information. Please give me the names of officers commanding at these points, that I may know what to rely upon. How furthered Atlanta will scouts from the army operate?

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding Troops, &c.
