Colonel ADAMS:

SIR: Your note is received. The demand relative to the negroes must be complied with. The matter of disagreement relating to your orders from General Blunt and General Curtis is a matter which can be more readily settled elsewhere than here.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

RICH'D C. VAUGHAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[P. S.]-At it is already late, I must require that you permit no portion of the property and negroes, above alluded to, to leave your lines.

HDQRS. TWELFTH REGIMENT KANSAS VOLUNTEERS,November 27, 1862.

Brigadier General R. C. VAUGHAN:

SIR: My guards are out and I shall follow your order relative to keeping whatever is within my lines here. I am subject to arrest from you, and choose a trial by court-martial rather than turn the negroes out of my camp. I do not do this, believe me, General Vaughan, out of disrespect to you, but because I believe it to be contrary to a general order from the War Department so to do.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

CHAS. W. ADAMS,

Colonel, Commanding Twelfth Regiment Kansas Volunteers.

DEAR GENERAL: If you will receive an informal visit from me, I will be glad to see you.

Yours, truly,

CHAS. W. ADAMS,

Colonel, Commanding.
