to come in. The third I shall place in reserve on my right. My headquarters will be at the Overton house, on the Richmond road, not far from the headquarters of General Birney.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

Major-General HANCOCK:

This dispatch is referred to General Hancock for explanation. At 2 p. m. I understood him that Birney's right was fixed, and that although then refused, yet the skirmishers were in position, and that General Wright could immediately go into position. I do not understand, therefore, why he should have to wait some time.*

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 30, 1864 - 5.30 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

If you are in position I desire you will push forward your skirmishers, supporting them and pressing back the enemy's skirmishers till his position is developed, and, if practicable, attack the enemy in case he appears weak. Warren, on the left, is threatened, and the enemy appear there in force.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTER SIXTH ARMY CORPS,

May 30, 1864 - 7 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Chief of Staff:

Notwithstanding constant exertion for several hours, I have but one division in position connecting with Hancock's right, and a second going in. The remaining division is massed on the road protecting the right flank. The country through which the troops moved from road is a swamp and tangle of the very worst character, and no possible effort could have got the troops sooner in position. The skirmish line report entrenchments in front of and a little to the right of the division in position. I have ordered the skirmish line well pressed forward, but it is too late to follow it up by an attack to-night. I have just returned from the line.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

MAY 30, 1864 - 7 p. m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

GENERAL: You will attack the enemy in your front if you have pushed up men enough to develop his position.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
