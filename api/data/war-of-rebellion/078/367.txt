LEXINGTON, KY., September 12, 1864.

Brigadier General A. C. GILLEM,

Bull's Gap, Tenn.:

It is impossible for me to reach Pound Gap before the 23d, owing to the difficulty of accumulating supplies. I think the rebels have more force than you state. The salt-works are well fortified with twelve or fifteen guns. I will let you know from Mount Sterling when I shall leave that point. If you can take two batteries, one of rifled guns, it will be better.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, September 12, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General BURBRIDGE,

Lexington, Ky.:

Your proposed movement should be made as early as possible, while Breckinridge's corps is occupied by General Sheridan near Winchester.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

BULL'S GAP, TENN., September 12, 1864.

General BURBRIDGE:

I shall expect you at Pound Gap on 23d. My battery is six 10- pounder rifle Parrotts, well handled. Enemy remain in vicinity of Jonesborough.

A. C. GILLEM,

Brigadier-General.

BURKESVILLE, September 12, 1864.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Lexington:

There is no doubt there is a large rebel force still hovering between Livingston and Sparta. Reliable information just received reports 1,200 in Sparta on Saturday, and a brigade scattered over the country around Livingston. General Hobson is on road from Columbia to Lebanon. Four hundred of my regiment left here this morning en route above.

J. W. WEATHERFORD,

Colonel Thirteenth Kentucky Cavalry.

WASHINGTON, September 12, 1864-12 noon.

Brigadier General S. MEREDITH,

Paducah, Ky.:

General A. J. Smith's troops cannot be added to your command. In regard to any assistance you may require you will communicate with General Burbridge.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
