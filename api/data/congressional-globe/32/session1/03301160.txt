THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 22,
General Scott is nominated on Mr. Mangum's programme,
i! is widely calculated, m tnese dinner or supper caucuses ii
of which 1 have been speaking, that he can carry the i
Northern States, with some (one only) Southern btate. j
Even such a State as Maryland is given up on the <;anv,-i<« l t
have seen! Ohio, Pemi.-ylvama, and New Vork. with |
th«itr solid columns, are set down lor isnn sure North Ca~ j
roliua, Tennef-ec, and Louisiana, are utterly sncnSce.l m j
thw calculation. Jt is felt and known that, with *ueh able i
men from 'iVmicPsee speakmjr, a? Mr Gentry if reported to 1
have spoken the other ni^ht, in the Whig caucus, or *«uch i
as Mr. Outlaw, of North Carolina, speaking with the energy J
he is reported to have done, there can be no possible hope ]
of the^e States ;
Mr. Mangum's programme, therefore, is a wise one : ut~ j
ter alandoiiraenf of the compromise bills y and the permission j
to run General Scott in the free States, with the repeal, or (
virtual annvhner>tf of the fugitive slave law* wpon every ;
Whig banner* His strength in the free States will be deter- I
mined by the candidate the Democracy run a«eunstluin; I
but it is obviou-,already, that in Ohio, central and we-tcm '
New York, Abolition Democracy will beat Win:? Atir-mum |
in this scheme, two to one. The 4>eet \Vm« ~<l"mict-= in
Ohio have been cut out by doin;t^oj,niji Democratic At>u-
V.tion; and m this race of demagoying, there ;s nothing '
that can equal, much less eclipse, «ueh men as Kantoul, in 1
New England, or the Olitwe and Gidding>  lreo Democracy |
of Ohio.
i have no right to advise you, Messrs. Editor^, hut the 1
programme I have marked out for mvsc.lt ] may ;i>k \ou to !
publi-h for others to see. As a Northern ari:i I - hall ijo—
n.w, I must go—with the IVorthern Winy p()rtv, <-ven with !
this threatened new inscription of it. " The practical nulli '
jicatun. of the fugitive slave section of the Constitution;" ■
Miiipiy becaire 1 have nowhere oho to go, s-ave into the f
arms of a Democracy, three fourths of whose presses in the !
State in which I reside go lor the very same thing, and !
almost evtMUhins; else besides. No smsrle man, or hmpje !
set of men, can breast the flood of Abolitionism when such ;
men as Mr. Mdtigum take away their dvkes. lie who !
attempts it would only be drowm'd iu some Zuyder Zee. 1
Th« Whig party id dear to me, and I cannot abandon it i
now, even with these its great faults, to cling to something j
worse. General Scott, if nominated ami elected by u*. is j
a man whom, of himself, we cjjn trn*i, and we iim>thw
as well as wt! can in the mahuia oramid the influence* th;U !
will have nominated and elected htm. They doom u.s ;i!l '
to pio*euption, to uuer proscription; we see, know, and
feel, «v. like influences did under General Taj l>r; but what i
men rufler are things unimportant. a< Ionic as a pnneiple ■'
can he maintained. Parties are never perfect, and a man !i
must make a choice of the beM of them. Cixi<'i Genual j
Scott, a* umh r General Taj lor, if Gcnei tl Seotf i> imiht til ''
to tlse influence* that make him President, Mr. \Yi i>«aui i
must han^' aijam around ante chambers, as he lumj? tx-iore, j
repuh'ed or fro/,cm, and Mr. Fillmore mu.-t he smvreil aiu^ !
not having the power to pet evfen a clerkship for a fi lend, ot '
Mr. Cl.iy be denounced, as denounced he was wh.ni he
introduced his omnibus bill. ,
The future is Uu* with events. No human beinjrcuri fore- jj
see or control them. It soem-. to me an utter dir-rupiion of ';
all old parties is portending. 1

I do jt -r these ^o.iiftnvniCiUion? %vhen
they propefd frain the twual of coitihiuni-
catioii; but when Taere 'j? ioternnl evirlf-nr,* that
they proceed from a higher official quarter, I may
feel myself called on, as 1 now do, to stigmatize
their falsehood, and brand their mendacity as
they deserve, and to fix the burning brand upon
the mendacious and sycophantic calumniator. In
this letter to the New York Express, i am charged
with a coalition with the Senator from New Yoik,
tunned ai a supper parties and dinner parties;"
the rewards of which coalition is to bring high
offices to the " high contracting parties," and their
friends respectively. Sir, every charge of coali-
tion, preconcert, or agreement with that Senator,
on any public question, i pronounce to be un-
qualifiedly and absolutely false. We are under-
stood to agree on the presidential question. On
that I have not been deflected, for i stand now
where I stood four ycats a^o, as my colleague
[Mr. Badger] well knows, and will be ready to
verify on ail proper occasions.
The author of t: e letter undertakes to assign
motives to me—the desire of high office, &c., &c.—
and yet is somewhat at fault to designate it. The
only one named i^ indivisible, notwithstanding
two gentlemen are na-ned for it. The terms of
the coalition are t.h:^ulaily inexplicit and indefi-
nite. The calumniator is at fault—not in lus dirty
trade, but as to the stipulations contained in the
coalition.
Another is still more serious—it repiesents me
in the light of venality, as having been selected in
a private caucus—the New York Senator being
present, and a prominent poison 111 it—to preside
m u Concessional caucus, to rule certain points
of order to siut the vsewb of these conspirator!*.
This is equally false, is well known to the Sen-
ator fjoin Kentucky, [Mr. U^dcrwood,j who
nominated me in a caucus of the Whigs of* the
Senateeliuinnaii, as lie likewise did of the Oon-
grebsion^l caucus; which passed on both occasions
without dissent, and was done upon his own mo-
tion, and without consultation (as I presume)
with any one.
With a pioper respect for the Senator from
New York, .uid e^tun ne of his talents; but he has
as httle induenco o>i my opinions am' my a'tions
as anyone in this body; and L th.nkhe wnuM
verify that, as mattei of opinion, upon 0,1th, if re-
quired. ' jLian'.^htf r | Sir, with tegard to the chaise
of venality, I may *ay that I have hud the honor
of occupying, for several yoirn, the high seat
whi.-h vim now so worihdy and ably fiil; and ihe
last act of this hotly, on lay retirement, ! look
upon as the proudest honor eve«'conferred upon
me: which was the it nam'nous vote of the Senate—
with ti majority in pontics ad wise to me, and
when cue oide-anr eouH haw attested th: nro-
ceeuing—to give me the arimunl of bctkir) fixe 1

nnght have h id other impies-^ions. The skulking
hypocrire! The iaise, e,tit,-fhio.it e.ulmnniator!
Sir, 1 ha\e m my own mind no sort of doubt
about the nuth' t'Miip. I hn>e leceotly lieard ?i
speech m mis Ch./joei, not fio.n a iit-netor, be-
tween whi^i end portions of tlie Wier to the Ex-
press there is e rem'tikaole identity r f sentiment,
identity oi language, a-nl s.n^olar identity or co-
incidence in mmuie turns of phraseology. It is
incredible that h"(!i did not proceed from^tiie name
forge which has hitherto turned out niueh base,
uneorrent coin, aed ) have thousrht proaer to no-
tice and brand it vjifi the stigma of hv.se, unpro-
voked, dehberate and deliberated falseiu.od, so far
as 1 am able to do so; and if tlie author can think
of anything (as doubtkss he can in his vocation)
that, will more stioru'jy and pointedly exme^s eosi-
tempt and o >rttamely on mv part, ho ha", by the.se
a carte blanche from me to write it, and
print it, too, in the Express, always with the res-
ervation that he is neither to make me say or insin-
uate that, in my opinion, the author has any essen-
tial element of a true gentleman. A haif-way
mendicant of an editor, who fishes up his dirty and
dependent bread from the filthy pools of slander
and calumny, may, in some sort, in some circum-
stances, be an object of pity, for "his poverty
and not his will consents."
But when some freak of fortune shall throw an
editor into a high official position, and he shall
affect the loftiest airs of a brilliant court, and ma-
jestically roll in his splendid coach through the
broad avenues of the capital of the Union—his
official position serving asa passport to refined and
virtuous, and the highest and most polished cir-
cles of society, it is always to be deplored to find
him devoid of the principles, the sentiments, and
the feelings of a gentleman—and when this pass-
port enables him to find his way to " private sup-
per or dinner parties," and we find him prowling
about for the means of picking up calumny and
slanders or facts, as the case may be, in th3 way
of his vocation, to minister to the rabid appetites
of the readers of his press or Express, and thus
abusing the hospitalities in which he unworthily
participates, he is a fit subject to be kicked out of
every decent circle, and banished the society of
honorable men. That is my opinion.
I am alleged to have met the Senator at{C dinner
and supper parties," where fill the mischief has
been concocted, and the coalition perfected.
Sir, I have met the honorable Senator but once
on a social occasion this session, where all parties
met, Southern-Rights, Whigs, and Democrats,
and where an elegant and refined hospitality ex-
cluded every debatable and party matter.
Sir, 1 turn from this subject as 1 do from its
author, with loathing, contempt, and scorn.
The identity of lan^ua^e, of sentiment, and
other circumstances, plainly enough indicate the
author. 1 havelittle doubt he is one of the editors,
of the Express. And I here pronounce, under ail
the responsibilities that can appertain to me, that
he in a malicious slanderer, a mendacious eilum-
iu aor, and devoid of all the essential principles,
iris'incts, and feelings of a gentleman—a man of
honor. That editor of the Express, I take to be
now a member of the House of Representatives.
The PRESIDENT. The Chair cannot permit
such lan^ua^e. h is altogether out of order.
Mr. AJANGUM. I am aware, sir, that it i?
out of order; and I um done.
