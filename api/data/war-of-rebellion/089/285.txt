vigilant. The connections between the divisions were perfect. I would recommend that the pickets be allowed to connect the pits with a small trench in the open field at the center of the line of the Third Division and on the left of the Second Division. It can be done by supplying the pickets with intrenching tools or by sending a small fatigue party at night.

Respectfully submitted.
