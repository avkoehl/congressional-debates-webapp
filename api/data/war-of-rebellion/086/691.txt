HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EASTERN ARKANSAS, Helena, Ark., November 26, 1864.

Major General J. J. REYNOLDS:

SIR: After leaving you yesterday I landed at Laconia and learned from Mr. Churchill Blackburn, who resides there, that the steamer Rose Hambleton the day before landed and took on board about thirty bales of cotton, with Mr. and Miss Thompson. No gun-boat present. No gun-boat present. The gun-boats Tyler and Lexington were there when I arrived, which I Captain Hill has doubtless made the report of this fact to you, which I communicated to him. I did not arrive at Australia Landing until nearly night. I went to the first plantation, Glover's, but got no information in reference to Sherman. The road to Oakland on the railroad passes a succession of plantations, crossing the Sunflower and Tallahatchie. The distance is estimated at seventy-five miles, to Granada about 100 miles. Had I a mounted force of even 300 men I would have the pleasure of seeing you at this place, where, as you know, there are several matters requiring a higher authority to adjust them than I am vested with.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,N. B. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
