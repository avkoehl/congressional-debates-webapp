Major General E. KIRBY SMITH.

DEAR SIR: As sheriff of this county (Washington) I wish to know of you if the provost-marshal at this place has any right to interfere in cirminal or State matters when men are confined in jail as to having them released though they may volunteer. He has already had one man and woman released who were confined for an offense against the States laws. As there are now some others confined who are trying to get him to release them if they will volunteer, and as I do not wish to act in any way against the martial order, nor do I wish to act contrary to the State laws, only to do my duty to both, you will greatly oblige by giving me any instructions that you my think necessary in this matter. By compliance you will oblige,

Very respectfully, yours, &amp;c.,

S. T. SHIPLEY,

Sheriff.
