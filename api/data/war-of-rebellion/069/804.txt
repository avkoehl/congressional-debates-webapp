HDQRS. 41ST VIRGINIA INFANTRY, MAHONE'S Brigadier,May 21, 1864.

Major-General MAHONE:

SIR: I have the honor to state that I know that I saw a stand of colors with a lot of prisoners sent by me to the rear, which were captured by Private Thomas W. Savage, of Company I, of this regiment, on the 12th of this month, in a charge made by this brigade on the enemy, and that the said Savage recaptured from the enemy at the same time two North Carolinians of General Lane's brigade. I believe the colors was from the Seventeenth Michigan Regiments. The statement of Lieutenant J. B. Riddick, of Company I, of this regiment, who was an eye-witness of the transaction, will more fully explain the matter. There were several non-commissioned officers and privates who know the same facts and whose statement can be procured if deemed necessary.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. H. ETHEREDGE,

Major, Commanding Forty-first Virginia Infantry.

IN LINE OF BATTLE, May 21, 1864.

I know Private Thomas W. Savage to be a truthful and reliable man, and I take pleasure in stating that I believe he is wholly entitled to the credit of capturing the colors of the enemy on the 12th of May. I did not see the transaction because I was int he center of the regiment all the time, and Company I is on the extreme left.

R. B. BRINKLEY,

Captain Co. I, and Actg. Major 41st Virginia Infantry.
