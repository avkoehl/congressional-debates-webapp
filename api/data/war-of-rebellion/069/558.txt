The regiment covers the crossing at Sumner's Bridge and watches the Chickahominy down to and connects with our pickets at this place. I have another regiment watching Long Bridge and Jones' Bridge. This arrangement covers the left of the army and also the front of the camps at White House.

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I respectfully request that a pontoon train of twelve boats (canvas) be assigned to the Cavalry Corps, the pontoniers belonging to the train to be mounted. I am of the opinion it would greatly benefit the public service, and would be of great convenience to the Cavalry Corps. This train could accompany the cavalry and would greatly facilitate its movements in the passage of the small but deep rivers of this country.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 3, 1864.

This application is approved, and the train will be forwarded as soon as one can be procured. At present the train now with the army will be required generally with the infantry troops. A bridge train will, however, be provided for the cavalry should a special occasion require it.

By command of Major-General Meade:
