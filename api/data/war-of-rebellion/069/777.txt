Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: At is may be difficult for me to Yorktown immediately I have concluded to telegraph my dispatches from this point. I will report to army headquarters at once. General Sheridan was within 5 miles of Walkerton last night. He will probably move toward White House as soon as he can hear from his chief quartermaster, who came through with me.

Send two of the army gun-boats, if they can be spared, and one, if two cannot go, up the Pamunkey to White House, to remain and guard the river from West Point up until the garrison is removed.
