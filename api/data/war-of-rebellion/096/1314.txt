He is unable to ascertain the whereabouts of the enemy to attack him without cavalry. He believes that if the cavalry were sent to him he could attack the enemy and defeat any chance of his reaching Richmond. Colonel Haskell is at the Yellow Tavern, with scouts out, and orders to keep you advised.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

TELEGRAPH ROAD,

March 15, 1865-11.5 a. m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL,

Commanding Department of Richmond:

GENERAL: General Longstreet request me to say that he thinks you have been misinformed in regard to the enemy's movements and his threatening Richmond. He can see no indication of any such intention. Yesterday the enemy approached Mitchell's Shop, near Fredericksburg railroad, which was the nearest point they reached in the direction of Richmond. They now appear to be concentrating at Ashland, and General Lonstreet's thinks that if you could send him Fitz Lee's cavalry he could catch them. He can only guard two of the three principal roads leading from Ashland with his infantry. From Mitchell's Shop the enemy turned to Ashland, which may have led to General Early's information.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Forwarded to Secretary of War.)

TELEGRAPH ROAD,

[March] 15, 1865-1.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL,

Commanding Department of Richmond:

GENERAL: General Longsreet directs me to say that it is very important that General Fitz Lee should join him this evening or to-night. With his assistance a good many of the enemy might be captured, but without cavalry much cannot be done.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
