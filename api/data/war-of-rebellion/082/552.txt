The following dispatch * just received. Major-General Hancock has been advised# he must act on his own judgment, under the instructions received from you, all of which have been transmitted to him.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Deserters from Finegan's brigade, Mahone's division, came in last night. They report that last evening Wright's brigade of their division relieved Heth's division on the extreme right of their line, and that this division moved north of the Appomattox. This confirms what I telegraphed you at midnight. Have you sent any additional instructions to Hancock?

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., July 28, 1864.

Major-General MEADE, Commanding, &amp;c.,

I have given General Hancock no instructions that have not gone to you. My dispatches to you in the night I directed to be taken off at Foster's headquarters, for Hancock, so as to save time. If Hancock does not crush the enemy this morning I think it will be well to withdraw him during the night and get him in rear of Burnside before the enemy can return, keeping the cavalry and Butler's troops to occupy the attention of the enemy. This would be with the view of making the assault in front of Burnside.

U. S. GRANT,
