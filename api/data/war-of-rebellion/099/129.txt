HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Pocotaligo Landing, S. C., January 25, 1865.

Bvt. Brigadier General W. B. WOODS,

Commanding Brigade, Garden's Corners:

GENERAL: Reconnaissance are being made toward Salkehatchie, and it is important that you should keep up the movement from Garden's Corners. Continue it until further orders. If you can procure boats you will make an effort to cross at or near Combahee Ferry, but the general does not wish it done at the loss of life. It is merely to attract the enemy's attention.

By order of Major General O. O. Howard:

JOS. A. SLADEN,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Pocotaligo, S. C., January 25, 1865.

Brigadier General M. F. FORCE,

Commanding Third Division, Seventeenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The Major-general commanding directs that you cause tow regiments from your command to report at the railroad depot at daylight to-morrow. Captain Henley, aide-de-camp, will take them to the point they are expected to occupy. General Mower will endeavor to cross the Salkehatchie above the bridge, and these regiments are intended to cover certain roads in his rear. Send with them one wagon of ammunition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. CADLE, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Pocotaligo, S. C., January 25, 1865.

Bvt. Major General G. A. SMITH,

Commanding Fourth Division:

GENERAL: The Major-general commanding directs that you send one brigade from your command to Salkehatchie bridge, starting at 7 a.m. to-morrow, with instructions to make a demonstration against the enemy at that point and feign an attempt to force a crossing, so as to draw their attention from General Mower's attempt at crossing above. The general wishes the skirmish line pushed up as close to the river as possible, but care must be taken to prevent loss. He wishes the position taken intrenched and held until your brigade is relieved by forces from General Hatch's command. Should General Mower's movements cause the enemy to evacuate, your brigade will push across and occupy the works.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. CADLE, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
