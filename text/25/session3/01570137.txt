and is hereby, instructed forthvt ith to m titute pr iper legal
proceedings for the recovery of the s uiil

to show that this money had beem impioperly
paid
Mr McKAY stated the facts in support of the
claim, and cited letter of Messis Ca&s, Boyd,
and Edweids Mi McK admitted, howeiei,
that had he been in Mi Poinsett's place, he
should not have oidered the payment of this
money, though he was decidedly of opinion that
Lewis had an equitabh  claim
Mr MeKENNAN was opposed to the resolu-
tion, because it would involve a heavy expense,
but he insisted that the Secietary of Wai had no
right to have paid this money out of the contin-
gent fund of the Army, and his doing so meuted
the seveiest condemnation of the House

would not go back to inquire whethei a pievious

the foimation of the Government,  when extia
foice was iequued,foi  the Departments to em
ploy tempoiaiy cleiks, and pay them out of the
contingent fund
Mi   EVLRETT said it was time this ob]cc
tionable piactice was put a stop to, and, theiefoie,
he moved to iecomm.it, the lepoit, with the fol-
lowing mstiuctions
To isceitam and report the cases m which monev has
been paid under the direction of the W ir D( partmi lit, out
