HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 30, 1864.

General MEADE:

I am doing all in my power to push the troops forward, and, if possible, we will carry the crest. It is hard work, but we hope to accomplish it. I am fully alive to the importance of it.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-7.30 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

What do you mean by hard work to take the crest? I understand not a man has advanced beyond the enemy's line which you occupied immediately after exploding the mine. Do you mean to say your officers and men will not obey your orders to advance? If not, what is the obstacle? I wish to know the truth, and desire an immediate answer.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, Battery Morton, July 30, 1864.

General MEADE:

Your dispatch by Captain Jay received. The main body of General Potter's division is beyond the crater. I do not mean to say that my officers and men will not obey my orders to advance. I mean to say that it is very hard to advance to the crest. I have never in any report said anything different from what I conceived to be the truth. Were it not insubordinate I would say that the latter remark of your note was unofficerlike and ungentlemanly.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

JULY 30, 1864-7.40 a. m.

General BURNSIDE:

Will you do me the favor to send me a copy of my note to your per Captain Jay? I did not keep any copy of it, intending it to be confidential. Your reply requires I should have a copy.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS, July 30, 1864-7.40 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Your orders have been delivered. I think it of great importance that the artillery on the right, which enfilades the space between our old lines and the crater, be silenced. There is a battery in the woods by the ravine on right.

C. G. LORING.

Possibly also the rebel battery by railroad cut, opposite Ledlie's old right, can fire over here. Cannot the mortar battery be stirred up?
