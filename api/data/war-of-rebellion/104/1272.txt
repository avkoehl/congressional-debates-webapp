distinguished gallantry under General Johnston during the campaigns in Mississippi and Northern Georgia, and again under General hood in Tennessee, he won the confidence and esteem of all who knew him, and received as a lasting mark of General Johnston's appreciation of his services the proud appellation of the "young officer of great courage and sagacity." Prominent for all that distinguishes rising greatness, sagacity, courage, and intrepidity, combined with energy, perseverance, and that happy resort to expedients to meet sudden and great emergencies, his little band was rendered almost irresistible. During this military career he accomplished more brilliant results and rendered more valuable assistance and information than most officers with commands many times larger than his. To his company, so fondly attached to him by all the associations of close and intimate life; to the service, so much indebted for his concise, definite, and always accurate reports, and to society at large, of which he was one of the purest and brightest ornaments, his loss is irreparable. Peace to the ashes of this distinguished officer, whose death I join you in lamenting.
