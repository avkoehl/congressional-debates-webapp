HEADQUARTERS BRECKINRIDGE'S DIVISION,Twenty-eight miles form Knoxville, October 18, 1862.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Commanding Department of East Tennessee, Knoxville:

DEAR SIR: I inclose you a copy of General Bragg's order, just received.* Be kind enough to have transportation by rail to Chattanooga for my command of 2,500 ready by Tuesday next, and for Maxey's 5,000 by Thursday next. All my trains will be sent by common road. We will need forage and rations at Knoxville, and will be glad if you will order as much as possible of both, to be accumulated at Chattanooga. It is a neck and neck race for Murfreesborough and Nashville. I do not think the Federals will follow Bragg across the desert. They will push all their force into Tennessee by the other route. We must be ready to meet them.

Yours,

JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., October 20, 1862.

Brigadier-General FORREST,

Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

Under orders from General Bragg, I start 2,500 troops to-morrow for Shellmound, near Bridgeport, and will follow myself next day. Other troops will move on very soon. I hope you will collect all the transportation and subsistence and forage you can. Much of it should be sent to Bridgeport. Buell or Grant may be pushing for Nashville or Murfrresborough. Keep a sharp lookout.

JOHN. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.
