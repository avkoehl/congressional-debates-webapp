APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GtQBE.
[Januaiy 25,
25th Cong....3d Sess.
Bonds of United States Bank—Mr. Wright
Senate*
of the existing laws in íeference to the disburse-
ment of bank notes.
A encalar fiom the office of the Paymaster
General was issued, undei date of the 8th Octo-
ber, 1838, which is as follows:
"biR Arrangements having been made withthe United
btates Bank to pay the Treasurer's diafta to a certain
amount, at different places, and it being probable the notes
of that bank will be as acceptable to claimants, and in «ome
cases more conyement than specie, you will, should you
receive drifts on that bank or its agents, make as many of
3our payments bv check as you can, which will give the
receiver the option of taking paper or specie , and the De
partraent has no objection to your using the paper of that
bank in all your payments, so iar as it can be done legally "
The only other of these " orders and direc-
tions," to tvhirh I propose to refer, was issued
from the office of the Quartermaster General, and
bears date October 31, 1838    The language is
"Whenever remittances on the public account aie made
to you by tie Treasurer of the United States in notes of
the United States Bank of Pennsylvania, or by drafts of that
institution on local banks 01 agents, it if. desirable that, in
stead of demanding spt cie from the local banks or agents,
you receive from them, and di^btme, the bills oí said
*Bank of the United States,' in all cases when such bills
may be entirely satisfactory to the individuals to whom pay
ment may be made "
The Quartermaster General states that this cir-
cular was sent to but eight officers of that De-
partment, and that, understanding a construction
had been given to it to authoiize the payment out
of notes of less denominations than those al
lowed by the law oe the 14th of April, 1836, those
officers were immediately lnstiucted that the di-
rection was to be constiued in confoinaty with
that law, and not othei wise
The number of oiders and duections trans-
mitted with the message of the President is very
great, but upon a careful peiusal of them all, I
consider those refer) ed to above the only ones
which have material reference to the disburse-
ments to be made undei the arrangements with
the bank, and all which go a step to show that
the bills of the bank weie agreed to be disbursed,
as a pait of these anangements    And now, Mi
President, pei mit me to ask how fai any of these
orders authorize the assertion of the pitsident of
that institution that "airangcments were made
for the tao-e distant public disbursements in the
notes of the bank'"   "We have seen that the ar-
rangements between the Secretary of the ricas
my and the bank, in fact, weie that the payments
should be made " in specie ot its equnrdent," and
so fai as the collateial stipul ifion with the Sccie
tary of Wai may bo consideicd a pait of those
ai rangements, th it the same medium of payment
was íequired and agieed to be made by that also
In these nt¿oti Uioi)">, then, thtie weie no " ai
rangements made foi the more distant public dis-
buisements in the notisof the bank,"oi loi any
disbuisements, neat 01  distant, in those notes,
any fuithcr than they might be considered em-
braced jn the tt rms, eqnu alcnt to specie, and how
far that mi„ht be, would, of cruise, in all tase,
depend upon the will and ihoice and ostimiUon
of the public cieditor to whom p 15 ment w is to
be mad*     It will u rtamly not be pietended that
orders fiom the head oí a dep 11 tnipnt or a bun an,
containing dimply diu  tions foi the government
of the subordinates of that blanch of the service,
can change the terms of these contiacts, or give
to either patty lights which were not confened
by the contract  themselves     If *' ainngemcnts
were made " I  twci n the executive ofliceis and
the bank "foi the more distant public disburse-
ments in the notes of the bank," the right was
conferred upon the latter to make those disburse
ments in such notes, independent of any relations,
or rights, between the Government and its cied-
ltors, and a tender of the notes would be good
payment as between the Government and the
bank     Is such a right pietended or claimed by
the bank.giowmg out of the arrangements for
the sale and payment of its bonds ?    It has not
been, and is not     On the contrary, if no such
' arrangements " weie made, or right confened,
by the contracts, then nothing in the "oideisand
directions " from the heads of Departments and
bureaus to the disbuismg ofliceis could make the
one or confer the other    In this aspect of the
case, therefore, the president of the bank was
not au hori7ed by the facts to say that " arrange-
ments weie made for the more distant public
disbuisements in the notes of the bank "
While upon this part of the case, another in-
quiry should be made     Did these " orders and
duections" assume to confei upon the bank the
right to make disbursements in its notes' I here
most freely express my dissent from the policy
and practice indicated by some of these circulars
The Secretary tells us that some of them " in some
respects exceed what was intended" bv him,
and I think some of them go beyond a sound and
safe rule I cordially concur in the views and
policy upon which the Secretary acted, as ex-
piessed by himself, but I think some of the cir-
culars go much further and, instead of adopting
a policy which was calculated to hasten the re-
sumption of specie payments in the South and
West, and to restore the currency to a sound
state in those sections of the Union, must, if con-
tinued in force and acted upon, have had a strong
tendency in the opposite direction Did they,
however, assume to confer the right to make pub-
he disbuisements in bank notes ? Not one—not
even the broadest of them They uiged the pol
icy of making disbursements in that medium " so
far as it can be iegaZ/i/done," "inall cases where
such bills may be entirely satisfactory to the indi-
viduals to whom payment may be made," " un-
less the notes of said bank will not be received by
the public creditor," &c Thus in all cases de-
ferring to the option of the public creditor, and
to his legal rights, the question of making dis-
bursements in bank paper The orders, there-
fore, did not assume to confer the light to make
" public disbursements in the notes oí the bank,"
and even they, broad and indefensible as some of
them seem to me to be, do not bear out the presi-
dent of the bank in the declaration referred to.
yet this individual goes on to say, " these ar-
rangements, as honorable to the executive officeis
as they were beneficial to the public service,
brought the Government into efficient cooperation
for the reestablishmen tof the currency, and opened
the way for the lesumption of specie payments "
What" ai rangements" are here refeued to' Evi-
dently those spoken of in the previous sentence
of the letter, " for the more distant public dis-
buisements in the notes of the bank " Having
shown that no such " airangements" had been
made between " the executive officers" and the
bank, I may be peimitted to hope that those
woithy olliceis will not be made to suffer in the
public estimation under the bligh ting influence of
the compliment so giatuitously bestowed upon
them
Heie, Mi President, suffer me to ask, why do
you think this lettei of Ml Biddle was given to
the public? Was it, do you believe, to bestow
ciedit upon the executive officeis of this Govern-
ment, or to manifest his connection with and at-
tachment to this Admimstiation ' If this was the
motive, some of his able and sagacious friends
upon my light must ft el suiprise at his want of
sagacity They tell us, almost dally, that the
cause of this Admimstiation is a sinking cause,
that ours is a falling house, and they must deeply
re¿iet that this sagacious banker should now con-
clude to join his fortunes, and those of his insti
tution, to such an inten st Sn, these gentlemen
will ti 11 you that no such desires and objects have
given this letter to the light Was it, then, to
speak of the negotiations between those ext cutivo
ofhceis and the bank, and to do them justice in
that paiticular' No, in my opinion, no such ne-
gotiations piompted this letter, but ceitam nego-
tiations which the sagacious writer foresaw v, ere
about to take place at Hamsbuig, in his own
State, were the moving causes to this public ad-
dress, in the shape of a letter to an individual cor
íespondcnt The bank had been too deeply con-
cerned in the singular political transactions which
weie agitating agieat State Success began to be
doubtful, and a change of position, in advance,
was found to be advisable Hence these quiet
and peaceful declaiations, and these amicable ap-
pearances towards ancient enemies Hence this
abandonment of mercantile speculations, and this
neutidhty of posture in refeience to futuie events
Prom considerations like these, sir, I believe this
letter was wiitten, and not from any change of
feeling 01 spirit on the pait of the wntei, or the
institution ovei which he presides
I must ask a little more of your time, Mr
President, upon this lettei The writer says the
transactions between the Goveinment and the
bank, of which I have spoken so elaborately,
" brought the Government into efficient coopera-
tion for the «establishment of the currency, and
opened the way to a resumption of specie paj-
ments " The attogance of this expiession is so
excessive as to excite no othei emotion than that
of ridicule That the Government had been, ft >m
May, 1837, not cooperating with the bank, but
efficiently operating against the irredeemable pol-
icy and declarations of the bank and itspiesident,
"foi the reestabhshment of the cuirency," is
now matter of history, that the "airingements"
to which the lettei íefers, and which the wants
of the public Treasury, occasioned by the sus-
pension of the banks, and the legislation of Con-
gress, consequent thereupon, compelled, were cal-
culated to enable the bank the moie easily to pay
its debts to the Government, and thus to abandon
its irredeemable doctunes and policy, when, by
the action of other State institutions, they had
become no longei sustainable with a preservation
of credit, and to place itself upon the list of le
summg banks, is most likely. Maik dates and
facts The negotiation for the sale of the bond
of 1839 was completed and closed on the 1st of
August, 1838 The definitive offer of the Secre-
tary of the Treasury for the anticipations, and
mode and manner of payment upon the bond of
1838, was dated on the 25ih of July, 1838, and
the broad acceptance of that offer by the agent of
the bank, was of the day following By this offer
and acceptance, the fiist installment of $800,000
was to be paid on the 15th day of August, and
all the payments upon both " arrangements"
were, by the terms, of the same, to be made " in
specie or its equivalent "
How, then, were the notes of the bank to be
made applicable to these payments ' Could it be
done short of a resumption of specie payments
by the bank, so as to make its notes, in foim at
least, " equivalent to specie? " What do the acts
of the bank show to have been its sense of its
own couise and policy undei these circumstances'
It resumed specie payments on the 13th of Au-
gust, thirteen days after the payment was made
at the bank for the bond of 1839, but before the
diafts upon that deposit would be returned upon
it in any considerable amounts, and two days be-
foie the payment of the fiist installment upon
the bond of 1838 Did these tiansactions au
thonzc the president of the bank to say, that by
them the Government was biou°ht into efficient
" cooperation" for the reestablibhrnent of the cui-
rency ' Into efficient coopeiation with whom, or
with what' With an institution that had resisted,
with all its immense powei,the lesumption of
specie payments—the only measure by which
the cunency could be reestablished, which was
a debtor to the Goveinment to neaily eight mil-
lion dolíais, and which was compelled to ask
time foi payment, of one, two, thiee, and four
years, which found its extended obligations fall-
ing due so near the period when specie payments
, must be íesumed, 01 its «edit destroyed, that it
was dtiven to the " executive officeis" to seek
teims of payment which would enable it to per-
I form that high duty? Efficient cooperation with
such an institution, and by such means? Need
I say, sir, that the arrogance of tne assumption
is only equaled by the closing sentence of the
j paiagraph ?
I     Let me read it to you, Mr President    Here
I it is   " The resumption accordingly took place"
I —where do you suppose, sir'  The banks of the
whole Union had suspended specie payments in
May, 1837     This immeasurable  calamity was
visited upon the whole country, and now the
I president of the largest and most powerful bank
in the Union is telling us of the lesumption, of
1 the íetuin of the banks to their legal and moial
' obligations     He has befoie given us his exposi-
tion of the causes which brought about this great
and good result, and now he says " the resump-
i tion accordingly took place "   Agun I ask you,
I sn, wheie do you think it took p'ace, and when?
I He  shall  tell  you    " Throughout  the  middle
1 States on the 13th of August, in  many oí the
' southern and western States soon after " What,
I let me ask you, as one of the ícpresentatives of
that section of the Union, what became of the
humble northern and eastern States in this happy
annunciation to the Ameucan people? Weiethey
not %vorth the notice of the president of the bank?
Oi did lie not know that this same glorious work
of resumption, lor which he says the way tea'
I opened in August, had taken place in those States,
and was   tnumphaiitly sustained   against  his
