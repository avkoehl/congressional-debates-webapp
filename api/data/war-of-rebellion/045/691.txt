SANDY HOOK, July 14, 1863-3. 15 p. m.

General H. W. BENHAM,

Commanding Engineer Brigade, Washington:

I have just completed a bridge across the Potomac, at Harper's Ferry. General Warren telegraphs me to be prepared to throw another bridge at Shepherdstown or Berlin, and that he has sent to you for more bridge material to be sent up. If the bridge is built at Berlin, I shall want 600 feet more pontoon bridging. The material should be sent to Berlin by railway. There is a break in the canal below Berlin, so that the bridging could not be sent up by canal for several days. Please have better material sent up than was put in the last train. Most of the chesses are unfit for use. Please ask Colonel Pettes to have our letters sent by mail to Sandy Hook.

I. SPAULDING,

Lieutenant-Colonel of Volunteer Engineers.
