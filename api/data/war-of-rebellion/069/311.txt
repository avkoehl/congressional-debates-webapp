HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,Near the Mill, May 29, 1864 - 12.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel FORSYTH,

Cavalry Corps:

Your dispatch inclosing copy of communication from General Humphreys is received. I have driven in all stragglers found, and made dispositions to find all that may be between here and Chesterfield Station. I don't think there is any enemy on the north side of the North Anna, as I have discovered none "in holding the fords successively as they were abandoned by the infantry and in covering the rear of the army." I moved by the Chesterfield and Mangohick road and occupied Mangohick till Colonel Schriver had passed, who informed me that there was nothing in his rear. In addition to this, I patrolled the Bowling Green road 5 miles northward.
