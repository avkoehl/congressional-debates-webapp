broken up. The expeditions were made through a wooded and mountainous country in winter, amid snow and ice, chiefly by night, and many of the men were badly frost-bitten. Hundreds of deserters and recusants were arrested; some were killed in skirmishes; one man of the regiment killed. The Sixteenth also forwarded deserters, recruits, conscripts, &amp; c., to posts and camps of distribution. The number of persons thus arrested and guarded during the year is as follows: Deserters from regiments in the field captured and forwarded, 2,810, of whom 27 escaped; convalescents forwarded, 3,447, with 46 escapes; deserters from the draft captured and forwarded, 3,743, with 26 escapes; volunteers forwarded, 5,700. Total guarded, 15,637; total escapes, 99; number escorted up to July 1, 1865, averaged daily 150; number escorted during the remainder of the year averaged daily 63.

The following facts are interesting as exhibiting the amount of duty occasionally performed by officers of the corps. Colonel Charles M. Prevost, of this regiment, has commanded draft rendezvous, Springfield, Ill., since November 19, 1864; has superintended the forwarding of about 25,000 men to the front, and the discharge and final payments of sixty-three regiments and seven batteries, and has still thirty-four regiments to muster out. Lieutenant Colonel Stephen Moore has been on several important details of special duty while commanding provisional brigade and draft rendezvous at Elmira, N. Y. Second Lieutenant George R. Buffum tried in six months as judge-advocate, 151 cases, covering 5,503 cap pages, and returned 41 cases to department headquarters, principally in consequence of the muster out of all the witnesses, which fact was not verified without a large correspondence.

Seventeenth Regiment. - On duty during the year at Indianapolis, Ind., patrolling the city, guarding U. S. arsenal, State arsenal, and Government store-houses, and conducting men to the front. Forwarded 1,300 conscripts, 1,335 deserters, 3,400 recruits, 3,062 stragglers, 1,040 convalescents; total, 10,137; escapes, 56. Nineteen of the escaped men were lost by one officer, who was court-martialed by the commandant of the regiment, but permitted to send in his resignation. General duty very severe; men sometimes on guard for sixty hours. During one period of eight days the average detail for guard was one-half the regiment. Officers generally on double duty.

Eighteenth Regiment. - On duty as part of the garrison of Washington. In conjunction with other troops of the garrison, it has guarded 664 military and state prisoners in Carroll Prison, and 1,005 in Old Capitol Prison. Unaided, it has escorted 2,163 stragglers, 1,506 deserters, 4,668 recruits, 23,319 convalescents; total guarded and forwarded, 33,775; total escapes reported, 4.

Men on duty every other day; frequently detailed the very morning they were relieved; many detachments to escort exchanged prisoners. The sick list ran as high as fifty-two in consequence of the constant duty and the exposure to winter weather. Average number of prisoners
