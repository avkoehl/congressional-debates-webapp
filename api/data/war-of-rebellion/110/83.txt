The Honorable John Bell, who will not at this time commit himself publicly to that course, has said to me, in private conversation, that the result was inevitable. He sought an interview with me a day or two since, and said to me that Tennessee wouldd certainly become a member of the Confederate States, but that he could not so abruptly change his position as to favor that course immediately; that it would be more dignified to consider the Constitution before adopting it. I endeavored to satisfy him that the exigency would admit of no delay, and that a decided and bold course was in every way the better one. The ordinance of secession will certainly pass the Legislature, and I yet hope that the ordinance providing for the admission of the State into our Confederacy will also be adopted, both, of course, to be submitted to a vote of the people for ratification.

Andrew Johnson is on the stump in East Tennessee doing all the mishcef possible, and the internal feuds of the politicians in this State have been so fierce that our friends earnestly desire to take sure steps when they do move. I repeat, however, Tennessee will secede from the Union, and will apply for admission into the number of Confederate States.

It may be well to instruct me with as little delay as possible as to the terms of the convention to be concluded with this State, in the event of the failure on the part of the Legislature to provide for any otther steps of admission into our Confederacy than the call of a convention for that purpose. I do not know that it ought materially to modify our terms, but in a matter of so much importance it is, of course, proper that I should know the views of our Government as explicitly as possible.

I met last night, in the room of Governor Harris, Colonel Loughborough, of Missouri, a commissioner from that State accredited to the Governor, and he was about to leave this morning, but I prevailed on him to stay, that I might have a free conference with him. My meeting him was very fortunate, for his object in coming here was to make common coause between Missouri, Kentucky, and Tennessee for some present course that would protect them while they awaited results. I urged a more decided policy, and requested him to submit to me in writing a statement of the condition of Missouri and of what might be satisfactory to his people. I inclose it, marked Numbers 1.* His plan was to visit Governor Magoffin, of Kentucky, after leaving here, but after his interview with me he decided to return home immediately. Just before leaving he informed me that he had narowly escaped arrest as a spy, information to that effect having actually been lodged with the Governor, much to his amusement. It will give you some idea of the vigilance of the people here. Colonel Loughborough had been making some inquiry as to a safe and confidential plan of communicating with Saint Louis, and supposing it meant mischief, he was promptly reported as a suspicious person. I am confident that Missouri, with proper encouragement, will soon follow the example of Tennessee. Nothing hinders now but the course of Kentucky. The inaction of that State makes Missouri hesitate. Colonel Loughborough speaks in warm terms of the services rendered to Misnt Davis while a Cabinet minister at Washington. Colonel Newman, president of the Senate, has just resigned his seat to go home and organize his regiment, which he tenders to the President for service in the Confederate States. I inclose his letter, marked Numbers 2.* I also forward a statement from the military board of this place, marked Numbers 3.+ The board is composed of
