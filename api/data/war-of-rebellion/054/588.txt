Have just received the following dispatch:

My scouts came in from 9 miles of Ripley. Captured 4 prisoners. They state that 600 left Ripley in direction of Salem. My other scouts came in from Saulsbury, and report they had a skirmish with the enemy, and negroes report the enemy in Saulsbury. The negroes also state that Saulsbury is burned.

Reports of General Joseph E. Johnston, C. S. Army.

MERIDIAN, November 26, 1863.

Mr. PRESIDENT: As soon as Major-General Lee returned from his expedition in aid of General Bragg he was instructed to take his whole available force within reach, including that of Brigadier-General Forrest, and break up as much as possible of the Memphis and Charleston Railroad. He has not moved yet, but will do so, I hope, before the end of the week. After this expedition Brigadier-General Forrest will go into West Tennessee. The extent of frontier upon which our cavalry operates is too great, I respectfully submit, for the control of one officer. Major-General Lee has found occupation for the last two months on the northern frontier. With another such officer in the west our cavalry would be far more efficient. Major-General Hampton is intimately acquainted with much of that
