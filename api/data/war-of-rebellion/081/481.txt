Major-General HUMPHREYS,

The scouting party referred to is probably the one sent out yesterday from the Second Division, a report of which was made by telegraph and subsequently in person by me last evening to the commanding general. No party has been sent out from the Third Division.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

The party referred to appears to have been an unauthorized one, and I attach little if any importance to the report, which was not made to any officer so far as I can learn. The matter is being investigated. Scouts sent out this morning found a few pickets; four only were seen, near the railroad on the road from Gurley's.
