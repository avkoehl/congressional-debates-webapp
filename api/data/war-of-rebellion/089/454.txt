General CRAWFORD:

I wish you would have the ditch made as keep as it can be around Fort Howard. Have all the old breast-works leveled between it and Battery 26, and have the rear of Battery 26 built up to march the rest of it, and the ditch deepened all around, and also the parapet cut away from it on the west side. The road way should be made good for artillery all the way down the rear of the line. Please have the work begun at this early to-morrow.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
