the purpose of removing the regiments at Aransas Pass. General Roberts, who had lately returned from Pass Cavallo, had informed me that it was your intention to withdraw the forces from Aransas Pass, and from that fact there was no letter written to you before on this subject.

The major-general commanding desires to know the state of the works along the line of the Rio Grande, with a view, if possible, of withdrawing a part of the garrison to this point. He desires also to know whether any other part of your force can be spared from your district.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

CLINTON, ARK., June 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General CARR,

Commanding:

Arrived here 12 m. to-day. Shelby's command was estimated at 1,700 men and three pieces of artillery when he crossed White River. He is collecting all the detachments of guerrilla bands and forming them into companies. He has likewise ordered all of McRae's command to join him. Will send one scout to Kinderhook, on Batesville road; another to Meadows, on Owl Fork, to-morrow morning.

Respectfully,

JAMES STUART,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Scout.

DEVALL'S BLUFF, June 7, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER:

A messenger has just arrived from my regiment. He left there day before yesterday evening. The detachment of the Ninth Iowa Cavalry had not reached there up to that time. I sent guides with them that I brought through with me. Major Teed, whom I left in command, was out of rations, and expected yesterday, unless relieved by Ninth Iowa, to fall back as far as Austin, for the purpose of obtaining rations from Brownsville. They have nothing new from Shelby.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. F. GEIGER,

Colonel, Commanding Third Brigade.

WASHINGTON, D. C., June 7, 1864-2.20 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

When your communication shall be ready send it by express. There will be no danger of its miscarriage.

A. LINCOLN.
