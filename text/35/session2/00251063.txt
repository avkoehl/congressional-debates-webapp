im
rule's us and guides us now, as heretofore, and
as I hope for ages to come, will so shape out
ends that all will result in good.
Mr. CHANDLER obtained the floor.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Senators will be
good enough to come to order. The Chair re-
minds Senators that public business is waiting for
them to come to order.
Mr. GREEN. Mr. President 
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Senator
from Michigan yield to the Senator from Mis-
souri?
Mr. GREEN. I desire to ask the Senator if he
will give way for an executive session?
Mr. CHANDLER. I am willing to submit to
the Senate. If they desire to have an executive
session, I do not wish to interpose. I am pre-
pared to go on now if it is the will of the Senate.
Mr. GREEN. I make that motion.
Mr. SL1DELL. I believe it is not in order to
argue this pomt. There are reasons which might
be given in executive session, but not here. I
trust the debate will go on to-day. At a later hour
the Senator from Missouri can make his motion.
The VICE PRESi DENT. Tile Senator from
Michigan yields to the Senator from Missouri to
move that the Senate proceed to the consideration
of executive business. The- question is on that
motion.
The motion was agreed to; there being, on a
division—ayes 22, noes 12; and the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of executive business.
After some time spent therein, the doors were
reopened, and the Senate adjourned.

Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Would it not be
the regular mode, in proceeding with this call, to

The SPEAKER. The rule is in the following
words:
" 63. Upon the call of the House, the names of the mem-
bers shall be called over by the Clerk, and the absentees
noted; after which the names of the absentees shall again
be called over; the doors shall then be shut, and those for
whom no excuse or insufficient excuses are made may, by
order of those present, if fifteen in number, be taken into
custody as they appear, or may be sent for and taken into
custody, wherever to be found, by special messengers to be
appointed for that purpose."
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I move to dis-
pense with all further proceedings under the call;
and on that I call for the yeas and nays. Let
gentlemen have that way of putting down their
names, and showing who it is that oppose^sus-
pending proceedings under the call when there is
a quorum present.

Milledge L. Bonham.
Mr. Mc&UEEN. I have not seen my colleague
[Mr. Bonham] this morning; but I know that his
health has been very precarious during the win-
ter, and that he has been a great part of the time
confined to his room. I move, therefore, that he
be excused on the presumption that he is unwell
this morning, although I have not seen him.

■ Mr. BURNETT. I desire to state the reason
i why 1 was absent when the roll was first called.
I was at the Post Office Department, attending to
! very important business pertaining to my district,
j Mr. BRANCH. I was also at the Departments
: with a constituent of mine.
! Mr. COVODE. I discover that the doors are
j opened to let members in. Now I want this call
to be carried out in good faith,
j Mr. PHELPS, of Missouri. The gentleman
I undoubtedly refers to me. I was here and an-
i swered to my name when the call took place. I
1 went to the committee-room on business, and had
i a right to enter the Hall. That is the explana-
j don I have to make.
; Mr. UNDERWOOD. I suppose that, if gen-
j tlemen are here upon this call, there is no neces-
■ sity for their making any excuses.

| none.

: that he be excused.
Mr. CLARK, of Missouri. I will state that
! the condition of Mr. Caruthers's health does
i ■ not permit him to be present.
Air. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. I would in-
quire if the cases of my colleague [Mr. BtJR-
' nett] and of the gentleman from North Caro-
lina [Mr. Branch,] are not undisposed of? The
House has not yet passed upon their excuses.
The SPEAKER. Excuses for gentlemen now
in their seats are not necessary, they being pres-
sent, and the presumption being that they came
in during the call of the absentees and after their
names had been respectively passed by the Clerk
in calling the roll, and before the doors were or-
dered to be closed.
The question was taken; arid Mr. Caruthers
was excused. • "

Horace F. Clark. No excuse offered.
Isaiah D. Clawson. No excuse offered.

order.

ness to do, and this is a waste of time.
