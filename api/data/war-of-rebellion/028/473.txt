to you, with instructions to give such directions in relation to the employment of troops, and affording military aid for the enforcement of draft, as you may deem proper.

Your obedient servant,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

[Inclosure.]

HARRISBURG, October 23, 1862-12.15 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Notwithstanding the usual exaggerations, I think the organization to resist the draft in Schuylkill, Luzerne, and Carbon Counties is very formidable. There are several thousands in arms, and the people who will not join have been driven from the county. They will not permit the drafted men, who are willing, to leave, and yesterday forced them to get out of the cars. I wish to crush the resistance so effectually that the like will not occur again. One thousand regulars would be most efficient, and I suggest that one [regiment?] be ordered from the army. General A. Porter, who is here, and fully informed, agrees with me, and advises the employment of such a force.

I am getting volunteer troops ready.

Let me hear immediately.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON, October 23, 1862-3 p. m.

Governor CURTIN:

By my telegram of last evening, you were authorized to employ all the military force in your department to enforce the draft, and General Wool was also directed to aid you upon your requisition. I am not aware of any further assistance that can be required or given by the Department. Your request for 1,000 regulars has been referred to the General-in-Chief, with instructions to render any aid that may be in his power.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, PA., October 23, 1862-3.20 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Can I use General A. Porter, now here, to command troops to suppress the insurgents? I have no officer.

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor of Pennsylvania.

WASHINGTON, October 23, 1862.

Governor CURTIN:

You are authorized to call upon General Porter, and he is instructed* to report to you for orders. If you desire, I will give him the appointment of provost-marshal of the State.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
