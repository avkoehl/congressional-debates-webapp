The SPEAKER. The Chair desires to state
to the chairman of the Committee on Foreign
Affairs [Mr. Banks] that if the notice lie gave
to the House refers only to the resolution from
the Senate now upon the Speaker's table no
notice is required for the consideration of that.
The Chair understands the gentleman to in-
clude in the notice the right to report back
the resolution from the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, which requires five days' notice.
Mr. BANKS, if the Senate joint resolution
shall not by general consent be referred to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs, then the com-
mittee, if it chooses, will report a similar
resolution as an original resolution from that
committee.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman ask
general consent that the Senate joint resolution
on the subject of San Domingo be now referred
to the Committee on Foreign Affairs?
Mr. BANKS. I do.
Mr. WOOD. I object to it in every form
and at every stage.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts, [Mr. Basks,] as the Chair under-
stands, gives notice, in accordance with the
previous general consent of this House that
the Committee on Foreign Affairs shall have
leave to report on the subject after five days'
previous notice, that he will, on Monday next,
make a report from that committee on the
subject of San Domingo.
Mr. WOOD. The only reference of this
question to the Committee on Foreign Affairs
during" this session was the reference of a
joint resolution introduced by the gentleman
from Massachusetts himself. That is the only
form in which that committee can bring the
question before this House.
Mr. BANKS. We do not propose to present
it in any other form than that.
Mr. WOOD. The Senate joint resolution
upon that subject is upon the Speaker's table,
and there I wish it to remain.
The SPEAKER. The Chair desired merely
to state to the House, so that all might under-
stand it, the notice desired to be given by the
gentleman from Massachusetts.
Mr. FITCH. I ask unanimous consent to
,ubmit at this time, for printing and reference,
some amendments I have prepared and pro-
pose to offer, if I have opportunity, to the
joint resolution of the Senate upon the subject
of San Domingo.
The amendments, which were read, were as
follows :
Tn section one strikeout the words " island of Sim

other information with respect to said government
as to the sn,id commissioners shall seem desirable
or important with reference to the recognition otthe
independent existence of said government by tne

Mr. FITCH. I ask that the amendments
just read be ordered to be printed, and referred
to tiie Committee on Foreign Affairs.
No objection was made; and it was ordered
accordingly.
