HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 23, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

General Barlow reports his skirmish line in the immediate presence of the enemy's line of works. This skirmish line is about a mile in front of his line of battle, which had not moved, waiting for Russell's movements. I send this to you for your information and would suggest the sending a staff officer to ascertain exactly the position of Barlow's skirmish line to govern the movements of Ricketts and Russell.

GEO. G. MEADE.
