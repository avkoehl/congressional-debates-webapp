COLONEL: Major Greeno, Fourth Arkansas Cavalry Volunteers, with 130 men from cavalry depot, will start at daylight to-morrow morning on a scout toward Batesville. It is necessary to make the scout 100 stronger, and I am obliged to call upon you for 100 men, with the proper number of officers, whom you will have report to Major Greeno as he passes your camp, say about 6 o'clock to-morrow morning. Have your men provided with ten days' light rations, including hard bread, and see that go well provided with ammunition. The scout is a very important one, for reasons which I stated to you yesterday. We must not let Price pass through Arkansas in safety.
