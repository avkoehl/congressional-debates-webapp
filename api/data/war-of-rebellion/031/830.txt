General MILROY:

I am as anxious as you can be to clean out the rebel scoundrels from the counties you speak of, but I do not think there is any danger from Imboden, as his force is perfectly demoralized. He cannot subsist any considerable force in the Cheat River country, and, if he should go in there, we can cut him off at mouth of Seneca and Circleville from New Creek. It will probably be well to hold the Ninth until you hear some-thing further. Do, however, as you think best.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, December 4, 1862.

General MILROY,

New Creek, W. Va.:

Numbers Jackson is undoubtedly yet in the valley. Great apprehension is now felt for the safety of Harper's Ferry. I am decided in my opinion that it will be best for you to send only force enough to render Beverly safe, and hold the balance of your command ready to strike a blow at Jackson, or to move up the valley to Monterey from New Creek, whenever the rebel force leaves Winchester. To operate from Beverly during the coming month will be almost impossible, on account of climate and roads.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
