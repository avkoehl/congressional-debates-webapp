(Received 1 a. m. 26th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

Hood seems to be moving, as it were, to the Alabama line, leaving open to me the road to Macon, as also to Augusta; but his cavalry is busy on our roads. A force (number estimated as high as 8,000) is reported to have captured Athens, Ala., as also a regiment of 350 sent to their relief. I have sent Newton's DIVISION up to Chattanooga in cars, and will send another DIVISION to Rome. If I were sure that Savannah would soon be in our possession I would be tempted to make for Milledgeville and Augusta; but I must secure what I have. Jeff. Davis is at Macon.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Rebels still in possession of the railroad between Pulaski and Decatur, but have not yet struck Nashville and Chattanooga road. Every exertion is making by district commander here and at Chattanooga to overtake and destroy this force. Jackson's rebel cavalry is north of Chattahoochee and captured a train near Marietta last night. His main body was at Villa Rica. Wheeler is at Corinth, Ms. My wires are all working, except to Athens, Ala.
