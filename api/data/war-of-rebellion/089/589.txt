A small party of the enemy's cavalry made a dash on our pickets near Full's Mills and the junction of the Charles City and Long Bridge roads. They were soon repulsed without loss.

Major-General TERRY,

Army of the James:

The enemy have a cavalry force at Hopewell Church, probably sent there to prevent such raids as that of last week. If your cavalry is it good condition I think it would be well to drive them out. As large a force as you can send should go for that purpose.

The cavalry are good condition and about 1,500 men could be taken out. Is the Hopewell Church referred to the one north of the York River Railroad, about two miles from Tunstall's Station and six miles from White House?

CITY POINT, November 10, 1864. (received 5.40 p. m.)

Major-General TERRY:

The Hopewell Church referred to is about two miles from Jones' Bridge. I don't want the cross the Chickahominy, but to get out near to it and above Jones' Brigade, sweeping down from there to below the brigade.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
