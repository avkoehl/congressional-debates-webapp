HEADQUARTERS SIXTH DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS, MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Edgefield, Tenn., December 6, 1864 - 9.45 p. m.

Colonel T. J. HARRISON,

Commanding Brigade:

I am just in receipt of a circular from corps headquarters requiring the whole of the cavalry force to be concentrated here by Friday night, the 9th instant. I am not included, in the absence of General Johnson, to give orders in the premises, but respectfully suggest to you the propriety of dispatching a messenger, with such escort as you may think necessary, to Lieutenant-Colonel Baird, commanding Fifth Iowa Cavalry, requiring him to return at once, by the best route, bringing with him what horses he may have collected, or may be able to collect on his return march. Every exertion consistent with the concentration of the command at the day named must in the meantime be used. Please notify Colonel Garrard in the morning that he must be here by Friday night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. T. WELLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GALLATIN, December 6, 1864.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

It does seem increasable that Breckinridge should be able to come in with so large a force, but the scouts all agreed in their accounts; another who came in later says pontoons have been building at Lebanon. Lebanon is on the Sparta route from East Tennessee. My force toward Carthage will report the moment there is anything certain, and I will use every effort to obtain information. I have not exceeding 100 serviceable horses, and they are all needed for my command, but I have three large parties out two days that should bring me 150 more to-day. Gun-boats had not arrived at 7 o'clock' expect them when I reach the lauding. I have camp on Cole's Ferry road this morning.

GALLATIN, December 6, 1864.

Major E. B. BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cavalry Corps:

My cavalry reached Carthage this morning; all quiet there. If Breckinridge has come through at all, he has not come by way of Sparta; no force there. Have ordered my couriers to scout from Carthage toward Lebanon as far as possible, and on return destroy all boats down until my party is met destroying up. Scouts to Lebanon failed to get in to-day. Small rebel forces of Dibrell's command picket the river in my front and pressing horses. No gun-boats have appeared. Will be able to make a return of horses day after to-morrow.

J. H. HAMMOND,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
