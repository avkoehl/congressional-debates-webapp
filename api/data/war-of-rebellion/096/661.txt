hospitals which are on the other side of the Appomattox, they mentioning the fact because it is unusual, and without any attempt at explanation. They state also that one of their men saw a division, understood to be one of Early's moving up the Appomattox by a road on the other side, but where they were bound no one seemed to know. All their statements, beyond the fact that none of the troops in their vicinity had moved, seem to be little more than camp rumor.

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

A deserter just in, who represents himself as having been on guard at the bridge over the Appomattox at Petersburg yesterday, says that nine pieces of artillery passed the bridge going in direction of Richmond, and that on officer told him that fifty-nine pieces were to be moved. He also says that a hospital steward told him that orders had been issued to pack up their supplies and be ready to move. He further says that orders had been issued by General Lee to the citizens of Petersburg to remove all cotton and tobacco within seven days. He thinks that order was issued yesterday.

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

To only part of my picket-line which can be advanced to advantage is at one of the points where deserters come, in and I do not believe it would be expedient to do it to-night. To morrow- I will examine the point again and report result. The gain by the advance will consist mainly in increasing the distance from our line of works, say 100 yards.
