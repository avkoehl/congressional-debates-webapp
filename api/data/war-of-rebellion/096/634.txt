CORPS COMMANDERS:

From information received it is believed that an attempt will be made to carry center. To meet such an attack you will be prepared to move upon telegraphic notice with all your command, exclusive of garrison and pickets, toward Fort Howard. Should you find the enemy allowed to come thorough our lines you will understand that this is done with a purpose. Prepare your artillery to move quickly and be ready to distribute what you have not already in your line. The artillery of the Fifth Corps will be held where it is now encamped.

By order of Major-General Parke:
