in company with Mr. Bostick. The four United States Government horses I ordered came in soon after. Learned that one Stone had been in the neighborhood of Austin selling ammunition, but was there now. Having accomplished all that was in my power to do in carrying out my instructions, I moved up above the wreck of the steamer Diligent and had some plank, the remains of an old cotton boat, put on board. Then, re-embarking my troops, returned to Helena, arriving here about 3 p. m. 12th January, 1865.

HDQRS. COMPANY C, SIXTIETH U. S. COLORED INFANTRY,Helena, Ark., January 14, 1865.

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that, in obedience to orders received from the general commanding, I embarked with one commissioned officer and forty men of Company C, Sixtieth U. S. Colored Infantry, and one commissioned officer and twenty men of the Eighty-seventh Illinois Mounted Infantry, under my command, at 9 p. m. 12th January, 1865, on board steamer Dove; proceeded up the Mississippi River, landing on the Mississippi shore about two miles below Harbert's plantation, landing the mounted infantry and dashed up to the Harbert place, surrounding it, to try and capture one Willis Harbert, colored deserter. Found him out in a corncrib, about one mile from the place, asleep, with a horse saddled outside, ready for him to escape if in danger of capture. Returning to the landing at Harbert's, the boat had arrived. Stationed my pickets, the troops remaining on board during the night. At daylight the infantry were ordered on shore, and two army wagons and teams which I took up, and they commenced hauling in the corn on the place. During the day tow white families and one colored, refugees, desiring to come within the lines of the Union army, came aboard; all of their effects were brought in and the cotton they had raised during the season. About 500 bushels of corn were got in during the day, of which 200 bushels belonged to a Mr. Bond, one of the refugees brought down. I believe him to be a loyal men. We re-embarked our troops at nightfall and returned to Helena.
