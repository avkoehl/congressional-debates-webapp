night, and on the mountain above Wimm's. I have also ordered Corse's last night's camp to be lit up.

Cockerill this afternoon will move two regiments across Lookout Creek, and drive what parties he may find up the mountain trails. There are iron-works here and at Johnson's Crook newly built, one finished, others in process. Shall I destroy them or not?

Is it not better to march in return straight down the valley to Wauhatchie than to go by Whiteside's?

I have to honor to be, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

HUGH EWING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HDQRS. IN THE FIELD, 4TH DIV., 15TH ARMY CORPS,Trenton, Ga., November 19, 1863.

Brigadier-General CORSE,

Commanding Second Brigade:

GENERAL: You will take position near Johnson's Crook Gap, sending a detachment to show its head on the top of Lookout Mountain, and a second, half way up the ascent, both to demonstrate by fires, chopping, &c., taking care not to be cut off. Your main force, with the artillery, front up stream, covering your communications with Trenton and your detachment. Feel well in all directions with mounted men, and fall back on the First Brigade, if necessary.

Respectfully,

HUGH EWING,

Brigadier-General Commanding.
HDQRS. IN THE FIELD, 4TH DIV., 15TH ARMY CORPS,Trenton, Ga., November 19, 1863.

Colonel LOOMIS,

Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: You will come down Raccoon Mountain by Wimm's Gap, and stretch up stream some 4 or 5 miles, leaving a regiment on the mountain to occupy the head of the gap, with instructions to build extensive camp fires. Occupying the center, move rapidly to either wing if you hear it strongly assailed, looking, however, chiefly up stream toward General Corse, at Johnson's Crook Gap, in the Lookout.

Very respectfully,

HUGH EWING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HDQRS. IN THE FIELD, 4TH DIV., 15TH ARMY CORPS,Trenton, Ga., November 19, 1863.

Colonel LOOMIS,

Commanding First Brigade:

COLONEL: If you hear at any time heavy firing in the direction of General Corse, move rapidly to his assistance, and go to work at close quarters, notifying me.

Respectfully,

HUGH EWING,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
