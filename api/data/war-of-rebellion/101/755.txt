HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF Thibodeaux, February 6, 1865.

Major G. R. DAVIS, Napoleonsville:

The general commanding desires to know if he is to understand from your report that there is a practicable road crossing the canal leading to the lower portion of Bayou Saint Vincent. In other words, can the enemy pass from Grand Bayou to Labadieville without passing in the vicinity of Napoleonsville? If they pass in your vicinity, how far is such place of passing from your pickets? Answer by telegraph immediately.

Captain FREDERICK SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of New Orleans:

The commanding officer at Napoleonville knowing more about the plantation roads which the rebel cavalry use in passing around Napoleonsville, I telegraphed him, and this is his answer:

NAPOLEONSVILLE, February 6, 1865.

Captain B. B. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Not practicable for wagons. Mounted men can pass, crossing the canal at Pike's Bridge, four miles and half from Bayou La Fourches, strike Bayou Saint Vincent road two miles and a half rom Bayou La Fourche, pass outside my pickets on canal road about three miles, outside my pickets in Kittredge's lane one mile; pass Pike's, Bartley's, Blanchard's, Jones', and Rodrique's plantation.

G. R. DAVIS,

Major, Commanding Post.

Yours,

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.

Captain JOSEPH HIBBERT, Jr.,Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Gulf, New Orleans:

It was Lieutenant Omar Boudreaux who led the guerrilla party that robbed the stores at Labadieville and that murdered our citizens friend Mr. Guerrin. I think the one captured at Morganza is the same man. If so, he should be shot as a common robber.

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.

DONALDSONVILLE, February 6, 1865.

Captain F. SPEED, Assistant Adjutant-General:

There has been no change here since my telegram of yesterday. Yesterday being very rainy and the roads almost impassable, nothing was done by Lieutenant Miles.

Respectfully,
