forces, and encountering all the dangers and pri-
vations of the service with the army. The dis-
crimination has been painfully felt by them, and I
may not have given to the terms of the resolution
the enlarged construction which itsframers in-
tlnded. However that may be, I deemed it the
safer course to wait and submit the subject again
to Congress. 1 am entirely satisfied that, while
both classes of the marine officers and men did
their duty, there was nothing in the service of the
battalion serving in the army, which entitled them
to any higher privileges than their brethren who,
belonging to the ships, also served ashore. The
number of these was not great; and I respectfully
recommend that they be put on a footing, as to
bounty land and other remuneration, with those
who have already received what was given by law
to the officers and men of the army.
I have the honor to be, very respectful^, your
obedient servant, J. Y. MASON.

.Report of tHe Postmaster General. *
Post Office Department,
December 2,'1843.
Sir: The post routes in operation within the
United Statps, on the 30th day of June last, were
163,208 miles in extent, and the annual transport-
ation of the mails over them was 41,012,579 miles,
costing $2,448,766, as follows, to wit:
On lailroach 4,327,400 miles, costing $.-584,192
Jn steamboats 4.385.600 " •< " 260,019
Agencies connected therewith 54,063
In coaches  14,555,J 88 miics, costing 796,992
In other modes not speci-
fied 17,744,19] « « 751,500
And m addition thereto, for foreign mail service 100,500
The table of mail service for the year ending the
30th of June, 1848, made up from the state of the
service, as it stood at the close of the year, exhib-
its, as compared with the table of 1847, an increase
in the length of the routes in the United States of
9,390 miles, and an increase on the amount of
annual transportation of 2,124,680 miles; but a
decrease in the cost of trans-pori-mou of $-12,145
There is, howevei, an increase in the cost of agen-
cies to be deducted, of  7,910
Leaving a balance of saving in the cost of our in-
land mails for 1848, as compaied -with 1847, of ,$4,235
But the cost of foreiim maiK which appears for the
time m the tables of Uih year, is $100,530
And deducting from this the saving above stated ... 4,235
Leaves an excess of cofet for 1848 over 1847, of— $96,265
For this we have 2,124,680 miles more of an-
nual transportation of our inland mails, and the
conveyance of ourforeign mails every othermonth,
a distance of 3,800 miles and back.
The new contracts made at the last annual let-
tings for the middle section, embracing New Jer-
sey, Pennsylvania, Delawaie. Maryland, arid
Ohio, went into operation on the 1st of July, 1848,
and exhibit a saving for the current year, to
end 30th of June next, upon the cost of the same
section for the past year, of $61,674. This is a
saving of nearly 12 per cent. Notwithstanding
the reduction of cost, the service has been in-
creased under the new contracts. The routes have
been extended in distance 293 miles further, and
in this way, and by greater frequency of trips this
section of service" has become greater than last
year by 658,897 miles of annual transportation.
On 1st July, 1845, the annual transportation of the mail* in
the United State?, amounted to  35,634,269 miles.
On the 3Uth June, 1846, to  37,398,414
Increase in service over the preceding
year  1,764,145 «
On 30th June, 1847, amounting to  38,887,899 "
increase over precedingyear  1,489,485 "
On 30Ui June, 1848, amounted to  41,012 579
"♦Increase over preceding year   2,124,680 u
Total increase foi the three years  5,378,310 «
But the cost of the service was lessened as follows:
On 1st Jnly, 1845, it stood at $2,986,504
On 30th June, 1846, <k   2,716,673
Reduction from the preceding year  $188,831
On 30th June 1847, u stood at $2,453,001
Reduction from the preceding year • ■ •. $263,672
On 30th June, 1848, it stood at $*^>448,766 ^
Reduction from the preceding year  {$4,235
Total reduction of cost in the-three years $456,738
This is exclusive of the foreign mail service per-
formed in the last year.
The operations of the three years show that the
mail service has been augmented fifteen per cent.,
and its cost at the same time diminished 15 7-10
per cent.
The results of the mail letting last spring, in
the middle section, will add to the service of the
current year 658,897 miles more of annual trans-
portation, while it makes a reduction from the cost
of the year ending June 30, 1848, of $61,674.
The number of mail contractors in the service
during the last year was 4,017, and the number of
local and mad agents and mail messengers was
248, connected with the service on railroads and
steamboats.
The service during the year has been performed
by the contractors with commendable zeal and ac-
tivity. Yet no energy can prevent occasional fail-
ures to deliver the mails in due time. In sections
of the country where no turnpikes or Macadam-
ized roads, or bridges over the streams, exist, at
certain seasons of the year, failures are unavoid-
able, even on the most improved and best con-
ducted routes. Unfavorable weather, ice, or snow
on the railroads, storms or fogs on the rivers, or
slight accidents to the machinery, must delay
the mails. The speed now given on them renders
it seldom possible to regain the time lost. This
has been, and always must be, the case.
There is, at this time, more service performed,
with more speed, and with as much regularity, as
at any former period: nor is it believed that more
expedition can be given on the principal mail
routes, until further improvements are made on the
roads, without endangering the connections neces-
sary to be made to insure the prompt and punctual
delivery of the mails.
The foreign service during the past year has
been increased by an additional stearri%r—the Her-
mann, being placed on the line between New York
and Bremen—and monthly trips are now performed
between those two cities with regularity.
On the 17th of October last, the Isabel was
placed on the line between Charleston and Havana,
in compliance with the contract with Messrs.
Mordecai & Gourdin, and will hereafter perform
semi-monthly trips.
The ocean steamers California, Panama, and
Oregon, constructed under a contract with- the
Secretary of the Navy, for service on the Pacific,
have sailed fiom New York for Panama, and the
California is expccted to commence service for
this department on the 1st of January next, from
Panama to Oregon.
The Secretary of the Navy has likewise em-
ployed the Falcon on the line between Havana
and Chagres, and she is expected to sail from
Havana to Chagres in time for the mails to reach
Panama, and be forwarded by the California to
the territories on the Pacific coast. This depart-
ment has made a contract for the transportation
of the mails across the Isthmus, from Charges
to Panama; so that in future there will be a regu-
lar monthly mail from Charleston, by Havana,
Chagres, and Panama, to Oregon.
It is to be regretted that the Ocean Steam Navi-
gation Company has not, as yet, been, able to
comply fully with their contract for service be-
tween New York and Bremen. But two vessels, i
the Washington and Hermann, have as yet been 1
completed. The third, the Franklin, has been |
launched, and great exertions are making to have
h^r finished, and take her place on the line. The
fourth vessel, it is believed, has not yet been com-
menced. Notwithstanding the failure of the com-
pany to have their vessels ready for the service
within the time specified in the contract, it is not
believed that the true policy or the interests of the
country would require any forfeiture of the con-
tract, or any other steps taken unfriendly to their
interests. The great exertions of the company
to comply with the contract, and to secure the
best class of vessels suited to the purposes of the
Government, and such as would do credit to the
country; thegreat expense of such an undertaking;
the want of experience in this country in the con-
struction of that class of vessels; the embarrass-
ments they have had to encounter from the unsettled
state of Europe, and from conflicting interests at
home; the importance of the service in connecting
our country more intimately and directly with the
enterprising and enlightened States of theGerman
Confederation, would entitle them to the indulgence
of Congress, and the forbearance of the Depart-
ment.
Since the contract was made with this company,
others have been given from New York to Liver-
pool, and from New York to New Orleans, upon
much more favorable terms than were allowed
them. The last contracts made by the Navy
Department under the direction of Congress, are,
for the term of ten years, and certain sums of
money advanced to aid in the completion of the
vessels. The contract made with the Ocean Steam
Navigation Company will last but five years, and
no money paid them until after the performance
of service. Similar liherality, it was hoped, would
have been extended to them, having done so much
towards the completion of their contract with-
out the aid of Government. They were the
pioneers in building that c\gss of vessels in this
country, and no doubt sustained serious injury in
constructing them, from the want of experience m
such undertakings. The importance of the ser-
vice to be performed, in a commercial and political
point of view, give them grounds to hope for the
favorable consideration of Congiess. Similar ad-
vantages extended to them would, it is believed,
enable them speedily to comply with their contract.,
and give a direct and important connection with
the central nations of Europe. The line of vessels
directed to be established under a contract with
the Secretary of the Navy, between New York
and New Orleans, will, it is beheven, be useless as
j a means of transporting the mails between those
points. The land and steamboat routes over which
the mail service is at present pei formed, are and will
be so much more expeditious and certain than by
that line, that the principal mails must be contin-
ued on them. Bat if the contract could be so
modified as to run daily between New York and
Charleston, the great Southern mail, even from
Philadelphia, might be sent by them to Charleston
or Savannah, and forwarded with more expedition
to New Orleans, than by the present routes. The
stables of the First Assistant Postmaster General
accompany this report, (A,) and are referred to
for the details of the service.
The number of post offices on 1st July last, was
16,159, being an increase during the year of 1,013.
The number of offices established was 1,309; the
number discontinued 296.
The number of postmasters appointed during
the year, was 4,121. Of this number 2,169 were
appointed in consequence of resignations, 184 in
consequence of deaths, 240 in consequence of
changing sites of offices, 197 in consequence of
removals, 3 in consequence of expiration of com-
missions which were not renewed, 14 in conse-
quence of commissions renewed, 5 inconsequence
of becoming presidential appointments, 1,309 in
consequence of new offices. The number of ap-
pointmenta-made between the 4th of March, 1845,
and the 1st of July, 1848, was 13,507; of this
number, the removals were 1,598; the balance
were made in consequence of resignations, deaths,
changes of the sites of the offices, or the establish-
ment of new ones. The act of the 17th May,
1848, directing the accounts of postmasteis from
the 1st January? 1847, to be readjusted, and that
they be allowed their commissions by the quarter
instead of the year, has been executed, and the sum
of $112,213.44 has been paid to 5,136 postmasters.
The gross revenue of the year ending on 30th
June last, including $200,000 appropriated by the
12th section of the act of 3d March, 1847, for the
postages of the Government, and the further sum
of $48,739 collected fiom and belonging to the ac-
counts of preceding years, amounted to $4,371,077.
This sum exceeds that of the preceding year
§425,184, being an increase of 10 77-100 per cent.;
and exceeds the annual average of the nine years
preceding the 1st July, 1845, $6,453.
The letter postage, including the $200,000 ap-
propriated as above stated, amounted to $3,550*304,
exceeding that of the preceding year $295,791,
being an increase at the rate of 9 9*100 per cent.
The newspaper postage for the year, amounted
to $767,334, making an increase of $124,174, which
is equal to 19 30-100 per cent.
The following table exhibits the revenues, in-
cluding the $200,000 appropriated for the postages
of the Government, as well as the expenditures
from 1st July, 1845, to 30th June, 1848:
