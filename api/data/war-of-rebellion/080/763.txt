Numbers 297. Report of Colonel George K. Griggs, Thirty-eighth Virginia Infantry, Barton's brigade, including operations June 17-November 17.

HEADQUARTERS THIRTY-EIGHTH VIRGINIA REGIMENT, November --, 1864.

COLONEL: *

On June 17 it took part in driving the enemy from our lines near Bermuda Hundred, which was accomplished with the loss of 1 killed and 1 wounded. Since that time my regiment has been holding one of the most exposed positions on this most important line, and has been engaged in several skirmishers with the enemy since occupying its present position.

August 25, the enemy's picket-line in front was captured, with some prisoners, but my loss here was not repaid by the advantages gained, having lost two very valuable officers-Captain Joyce, Company A, killed, and Captain W. G. Cabaniss, Company K, shot through the face so as to disable him from service, besides some good men.

November 17, it being desirable to advance our picket-line, and all necessary arrangements having been made, the picket-line, being slightly re-enforced, moved forward, and before the enemy well knew what was going on the larger number were prisoners.
