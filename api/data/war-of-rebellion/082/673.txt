CITY POINT, VA., July 30, 1864-6.30 a. m.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

The enemy seem to be in small force. They may hasten re-enforcements; take everything from your front. If they do, follow in and seize and hold the road to the last, informing me that I may take steps to strengthen you in time. The explosion blew up some guns and nearly an entire South Carolina regiment. Our men pushed forward to the breach without opposition, but unfortunately stopped there. They have been ordered forward again, and I am much in hopes it is still time to succeed.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

JULY 30, 1864-7 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatch received and measures taken to observe the picket-line and promptly take advantage of any movement. I will move out if there is any stir of the enemy whatever. The firing you may hear is that of my colored troops drilling.

Major-General, Commanding.
