MISSION RIDGE, November 19, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

General Wheeler reports his attack and the dispersion of the enemy's cavalry, pursuing them into their works at Knoxville, capturing 300 prisoners. The infantry force is close up, but I received no report from the commander.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF TENNESSEE, Mission Ridge, November 19, 1863.

General S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond:

GENERAL: In your dispatch of the 17th instant, announcing the appointment of general officers to the cavalry of this army, you call my attention to the fact that "the brigades from Texas, Tennessee, Georgia and Kentucky are not represented by brigadiers from those States."

By reference to the organization you will see Texas has but two regiments serving as cavalry, and they are associated with one each from Arkansas and North Carolina in a brigade which is under the average size.

To represent them we have Brigadier-Generals Wharton, of Texas, and Kelly, of Arkansas. Tennessee has two brigades, and two brigadiers, Davidson and Humes. Georgia has one brigade under its senior colonel, is then commanding one on probation. These vacancies I shall ask to be filled when proper men are found, but a rigid adherence to the State rule will not always give efficient officers.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.

MISSION RIDGE, November 19, 1863.

General J. E. JOHNSTON:

The deserters are an incumbrance to me and must be shot or they run off again. General Maury consents to take them on his forts for laborers. I ask no exchange. Sherman's army just arrived.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
