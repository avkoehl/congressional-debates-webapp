BRANDY STATION, October 12, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Another citizen fully confirms the information contained in General Griffin's note. He seems to be reliable and thinks all their cavalry and about two regiments of infantry were here yesterday. He says General Stuart with the cavalry, all but one regiment, and the infantry moved this morning toward our right, but the soldiers said A. P. Hill was at Waterloo, and that the impression seemed to be that we were falling back to Bull Run, where there would be another fight.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS,October 13, 1863.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

An officer from General Gregg's cavalry who has been picketing at Fox's Ford reports being driven in, and the enemy crossing their infantry and artillery.

I have my right strongly picketed, and the road to Bealeton also, opposite F-'s Ford.

It will be necessary for me to change my front, and I must move my trains to-night.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,October 13, 1863-10 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Arrived here after a hard day's march. Had a skirmish with the enemy at Auburn, driving him before me. He had cavalry and artillery.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 13, 1863-7.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

By lapping by General French I have nearly reached Auburn with the head of my column. General French had a slight skirmish here with the cavalry, but they soon cleared out. He has probably reached Greenwich by this time. His trains, however, are not past Auburn by 2 miles. My men are bivouacking along the road. They are tired and sleepy, but have marched splendidly and are in fine spirits.
