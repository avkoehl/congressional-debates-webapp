HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 29, 1865 - 10.45 p. m.

The PRESIDENT,

City Point:

About 10.15 the enemy threw up a number of signal-rockets on different parts of his lines, then opened with mortars, and picket-firing greatly increased. I hardly can believe it is intended as an attack on my front, but may be intended to cover movements elsewhere.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.

GRAVELLY CREEK, March 29, 1865.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

A large body of cavalry were reported to have gone southeast yesterday. It may be barely possible that Sheridan will pass out west of them, leaving them to annoy your rear. You had better send a scouting party of cavalry far out to the rear to watch.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 29, 1865 - 10.45 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

Two of Sherman's men, Seventy-ninth Pennsylvania, Thirty-eight Indiana, taken prisoners near Fayetteville and escaped from neither guard at Roanoke Station, have just come in. They crossed the Nottoway below the railroad bridge. Saw and heard nothing of any large body of cavalry. The negroes told them that the rebel cavalry had gone to Dinwiddie to meet an expected raid from us. I sent out scouts, but have elicited nothing as yet.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 29, 1865 - 10 a. m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The corps officer of the day reports that the enemy were very busy on their works on different parts of the line during the past twenty-four hours. There was considerable stir in Petersburg during the night, and sharp picket-firing was kept up at many points. Sixteen deserters came in on Potter's front, representing three brigades of Grimes' division - Fifty-third North Carolina, Forty-fourth Georgia, Twelfth Alabama. No change is observable in enemy's line this a. m.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
