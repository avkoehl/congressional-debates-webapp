At 8 o"clock the same night an order of the Government was made known to the captain to cast off from the wharf and drop down and anchor below the forts, reminding him that he had entered the port without having asked leave of the commanders of said forts; and although Captain Burguero presented himself to General Butler, commandant-general of the department, with the intention of stating to him that, never having been in that port he was ignorant of its settled usages; that notwithstanding he came to, on passing before the forts and on arriving at the Lazaretto, nobody prevented him from going on; that if any signal had been made to him to stop he would have obeyed it, and that it did not appear to him to be just that the interests of his owners and freighters should suffer by the negligence of the commanders of those forts. The said General Butler having refused to listen to his reasons, and threatening him with sinking his vessel if he did not immediately comply with the order which had been given him, Captain Burguero, desiring to secure himself from responsibility, and to guard at the same time the rights of the owners against the heavy damages which he foresaw would follow upon such a strange order to go into quarantine when there had not been a single sick man on his ship, and to guard also the rights of some freighters who had shipped fruits which surely would rot and be thrown overboard, as in fact took place, went at once without delay, accompanied by his consignees, MM. Avendano Brothers, before Her Majesty's consul resident at New Orleans to extend the protest, which in form most solemn, he incloses to you, that you may thereby inform yourself of its contents and lay it before Her Majesty's Government in order to obtain just reparation and indemnification of the losses and damages which have been caused to those interested in the vessel, and to some freighters, by the effect of the measures which were so inopportunely and so unjustly taken with the steamer Cardenas to cause her to suffer from twenty-two days of quarantine, with such rigor as to challenge attention, as exercised only with that vessel, perhaps because she was Spanish, whilst the going up to the port was allowed to other vessels coming from the same place as the Cardenas,or subjecting them only to lighter quarantine, or none, as occurred with the American mail steamer Roanoke which arrived from Havana few minutes before the Cardenas.

If to such arbitrary action is added the strictness with which the authorities of the port acted on the day of the departure of the said steamer Cardenas, an exact and general search being made on board, without passing over the letters passengers were carrying with them, which were opened and read in the presence of all, Your Excellency and Her Majesty's Government will not do less than admit that there is just ground to claim from that of the United States what may satisfy the dignity of ours, and the injured interests of our subjects, damaged by the effect of the in comprehensible orders of General Butler, because, from the many interesting details which are shown by the protest is deduced the injustice and oppressiveness of the penalty imposed on the steamer Cardenas, making her, without cause, perform twenty-two days" quarantine after the vessel had received on board, on passing one of the forts, an officer of one of the detachments which garrisoned them, who asked the favor of being carried to the city, and after having been landed, together with thirty-five passengers that she brought from Havana, and finally after having been in full and complete communication and contact all the evening of the 4th of June with the crowded population of New Orleans, which through curiosity came to visit the vessel.
