¿^rrt Cono**-Svd Sess*                                  Independent Treasury—Mr. Bayard                                                                     Senate,
uex6(t   eafiialand   xb oHite cuntíol ovci the subject, not
withstanding any improper views or bias of the Executive
TheSen«or's[Mr Uathoitns] third objection is, that we
have no rieht to make a general deposite in banks, first, because
it is <m ving the use of the money to them, and^ secondly, because
it i= I violation ot that clau-e oi the Constitution which declares
that "no money shall be dnwn from the Treasury but in con-
sequence ofappropriations made by law" He then argues
that the binks aie, when such depositéis made, the Treasuiy,
and that to suffer them to use nis to draw the money fiom the
Treasury wnhout appropriation by law Were it not that the
argument proceed horn that distinguished Senatoi, it would
scare ly be worth a íeply The answer to the first bianch of
the objection, that we have no right to give the use of the peo
plp'í, money to the banks, i<?, that it assumes i fact which is not
a rictlv true It ia not giving the u«e of the money to the banks
alone, but to the people themselves, through tho medium of the
binks faeobjict md operation of the general deposite, so far
as It augments the banking capital, is to enable the batiks to ex
and ínrih"! acoom i odation an I facilities lo trade, which is, in
tht end, to promote th «eneral welfaie It le true that the
hanks may derive somn mciden'al profit, but that profit does not
more thuuompen lie them foi the ribks they encounter and
thcservjcPs mey peifoim m thetian fer of the public funds If,
then, the svstt m of generrl tit posites, which may beiegaidedas
one mode offsetcismsj thatpowei of disposition which the Go
urnmenthv  over its funds, will mote piomotc the general
we'ftr< than my other mode of keeping them, the Government
ought to idon that modi, as being m harmony with the gieat
principle whuh tits at the foundation of the tim>t This is pie
 rsely the view which was taken of the s>uhjeet by the last Ad
ministra t in, when it urged the binks to extend their accomrno-
dmons to the public, and lauded them fni the benefit* winch
they had confei ltd on trade and the business operations of so
(lety, as well as lor the magaitude and fidelity of the services
i enacted, as fist at agent?
lint, Sir I pi octet! to rxammt the second branch of h sobiec
tion, which respects tho constitutional provision m relation to
di iwm¿ money fr mi the Treasury    And here if becomes nt
ce sniy to «nt le pieci cly the meaning ot the phrise ustd m
the Constitution     I'h    pa-«i,e i  feiied  to occur* in  the'Hh
*ei tion ot the 1 «sf artich, and is in these words   " No money

pnprimons unit, by law"    The   woid Treasuiy novvheie
el«ip o curs  m   tho  Constitution, and is found m this Qth sec
tion, which is a sen< s oí re¡ tnoUve pro\isi ms on the powers
ofOwgu s    Tho gt-nei il power is given to collect revenue,
n I ta dispone of it   but not a syllable is su 1 about the mode
ol kiipingitfhi insr the period olieceipt and disbursement   This
negative piovim n is the only one on the subject    It is then
tuie thai this in gunc provision i« tobe undeistood in a lite

iy ti sitisfy  ihe I teial meaning of the terms "drawn iiom
tht I reastuy " or n is only a figurative mode of expression by
which the idea is meant to be conveyed, that the public money
should not be disbursed by any of its officeis unless under the
author ty of law      If the phrase is  used literally, and must
be undeistood as implying the existence of some great place
of deposite, then this absurdity would follow, thatin acountry
r )\ei!n,' more than one  million of square miles, the revenue
collected at points from fifteen hundied to two thousand miles'
distance must be brought to that pí ice oí deposite in order (o

cernir  nt, and whose jealous vigi'ance would never have slept
on si important a subject     In his written opinion, addressed
ta Prtsident Wí&hin£rton   on the subiect of the. bank charter
which he is opposing he expresses himself in February, 1791,
} .s-j thar- two years after the organization of the Government,
¿ti the following terms
"The report on the subject states the only general convenience
to he, the preventing tho iianapoiration and  e lanspoitation of
money buween the States and the Treasuiy, <.foi l past, ove i
the increase of circulating medium ascribed to it as a ment,
and which, according to my ideas of paper money, is clear y a
demerit ) Every State wdl iiav* to pay a sum of tax money
into the Tieasuiy, and the Tieasury will have to pay, in eveiy
Sta c, a part of the interest on the public debt, and salaneh to
the oihceisof Governmentíesrdontm that State In most ot
the States there will be a surplus of tax money to come up to
the seat of Government for the officers residing theie The
payment of intei e H and salary in each State may be made
by Treasuiy ordeis on the Stale Collectot Tins will take up
the greater part ol the money he has collected for his ¡State, and
consequently pre oent the great mas* of it f> om being drattn
out of the State "
He subsequently lemarbs, that "Treasury orders, and bills of
exchange may pi event the displacement of the mam masa of
oí thp money collected w hout the aid of any bink" ln-n
follows a passige which is an authority, upon both branches
of this,objection, of the ¡senatoi to general deposites
'Perhaps indeed, bank bills may he a more convenient ve
hiele than Treasury oider&, but a hule difference m the degree
oí convenience cannot constitute the necessity which the ton
stitution nnku. the ground foi assuming any non enumei ittd
powei Beside? the existing hanks ícr/í, without doubt

font "
Itis clear theieiore, Mi Piea lent, that the phrase refeired
to m the Constitution, conceived as it is in negative terms, was
not meant to imply the existence ot a local place of deposite for
thclunds of the Government, but m rely to provide that those
funds itnhe hands of the collecting officers should not be dis
bur&ed without duthoiny of law If the Genitor should say that
he does notnxeen to c< men 1 that the woid Tieatuiy means' oi e
gi and place of dtposite, but implies that, there shall be local
places oi deposite, which, taken together, constitute the 1 reasu
rv, then, I siy he th indons the literal meaning, and that those
t*l ict s m iv a¡> well be banks as the strong boxes of par tieular

then, in using Ihe funds deposited and which she has received m

Hut sn the V nor (Mi f alhoiln J using, a= ho g-jys, to
highei ground ind «Uilnngat the root of the evil, denes the
light or the í.oveuíment to tioat banknotes as noney, oi to
i ceive ny thing but gold and «ilvcr com in payment of the
dues of the Government The dnit of his argument to sustain
thip position is, that there is no express power guen to do so,
and that the right to leit-ive "ny thing el^e woui 1 give tie
il,ht to regulate whatever wis so recened In k ply to ti js
nguinent,Il up to uuseive th-t there are implied poweis as 1
h ivt l eioiCbhown, as well as express ones, and which au as
mucha pait of the f onstitution, the one as the other The
Constitution expiessly gives the [lower "to lay and tollcct
tixes, duties imposts, and excises," and says not a woid ibout
the medium in which they shall be collected Now, the gene
ral power to lay and collect taxes of necessity implies the n ht
and the duty to piccnbe the time of pat/men t themanriei of
payment, and tho quantity to be paid, wnce n i« impossible to
pxLrcise the power without specifying th< ^-e thiec \ articuláis
Put the manna of payment is precit-ely the question of what
sha11 be received, and, since it is indispensable that it should
be piescubod m (idt r to execute the powei, s.nA there is no
limitation on the drcietion of Congress, it follows asa necessa-

So much oi the Senator's objection as assumes that the rjg&i
to leceiveany othei property than money Would necessaiiiy
imply the i ight of regulating and inspecting ihe thiagreceiveil,
and which is held up to the South as a scaiecrow, as importing
a right to regulate the entire piopeity, a par* of which might
thus be received, is entirely fallacious, since the right of'mspec-
tion and regulation would, so fir as it resultsfrom this particular
power, be confined to such portion of the ptoperty as the £$
vernmet actually leceived Thus, in the instances pot of cotton
md tobacco, the necessity and right of inspection would extend
no farther than to the cotton and tobacco recen ed by the Cío
vemment, and not to the entire crep
The Senator [Mr Calhoun] next tells us that the right to le
ceive bnnk notes is hostile to the power to coin money, the Ob
(pet of which is to furnish a currency of uniformar d steady va.
Jue, and that as long as the notes of banks aie received m the
transactions of the Government, as money, it is impossible to
give stability to the standard of value, and the coining power is
defeated If the possible conflict between the two powers Is
lehed upon as anaigument to prove th?t one of them does not
evist, then I say that it is anaigument addiessed to discretion
m then use rather than a pioof that one of thpm does net exist
liut, sir, iti^ not true hat tht uniformity of the currency is tm-
pniPdby the mixture of paper and coin in the circulation We
liad the best eunency in the woild befoie the destruction of the
liank of the United States asi shall presently show, of greater
uniformity than could be produced by gold andsilret alone
Nor, sir, is i tiuc that paper can depiecmte the standard of va
Pie The standard ofvaluethioughout the United States tsand
must he gold and a lvei com, since that alone is a tender in pav*
ment of debts It is tuto, that the mmdmate issue of bank
notes banishes com by supplying its use as currency^ bu not
as a standard of value, and so fai as the raeie qmstion of
standaid is concerned, eo' Id work no mischief, but it pro
duct s mischief, m pie\cnting that pioper admixture of coin
and papei in the circulation which co stuntes a sound state
oí ttee cuuency, bavins? rt ference to the ordmaiy and extia-
ordmaiy demards for com It is equally tiue, that in case
of a ternpoiary Mispenston of specie payments the paper
itself may become depreciated with icference to that stand
aid, but it cannot depreciate the s andan!, that must ever
remain the same Where the paper, which compose& part of
the circulation, is payable and paid on demafid, m com, there
can be no depreciation of the papei within us n ituial sphere of
cncuhtion, with reference to that stmdard, for when issued be
yon I the wan¡s of the community it is immediately returned to
the banks Thus itappeais, from the íepoitof the ►Secretary of
the Tieasuiy, made in Decern  r, 1836, that the amount of bank
notes issued on the fiist of January, 3836, was $140,000000,
while the actual amountin circulation did not exceed ¿¡OS 000,-

Hut Í will not gniiuther into this matter I have thus gone
tin on rh the Senator's constitutional difficulties
In 1cpendcntly of the^e, u secrr«, Mi Picfident, that ore of
his most powerful objections is, that the Bank of 'he United
States oi Mi Huid e s limk, as he is pteasrd to call it, will
pi ice itself at the head of this leasue of hanks which are pro
posed by the anendmenf Why, sn' the objection, and the
tone and tenoi of the remarks which accompany it, are in the
true spirit of Macbeth when he exclaims
"We have scotched the snake, not killed if,
"She'll close and be herself, whilst oui poor malice
' Remains in danger of her Jormei tooth J
And in die same sj irit the whole pai iv would exclaim
' But let
"The frame of things disjoin, both the worlds suffer
" Eie we will eat our meal m fear, and sleep
"In the affliction of these temblé dieam",
" That shake us mchtly   '
I mi st pay however, Mi  Pi evident, that the dangei dreaded
fiom th it mctttution is ameie  'comageofthe brain"   And
here, su, let me make an observation on the subject of banks
rei erally    If one "were to foim an ¡dea of a bank from the
rhetorical denunciatrons which aie used here and elsewhere,
he would heledlo sup nose that it was some natura] monsfei
