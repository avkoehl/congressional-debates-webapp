of them. A road eventually will doubtless be found direct from Fort Laramie to Virginia City, but as yet the route I have described is the proper one for the troops to take. It is the route the emigrants use in reaching Montana. No emigrants, or a very few, take the route proposed by Captain J. L. Fisk, of Minnesota, as set forth in the Washington Morning Chronicle of 1st of June. His route is one on which to fight the Indians, as General Sully found out last summer, but the main body of the emigration will continue to go to Montana by the old emigrant road, via Fort Laramie and the South Pass.

I am, with highest respect, Your obedient servant,

BENJ. Alford,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
