HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,In the Field, near Tuscumbia, Ala., October 31, 1864.

General R. H. CHILTON,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: I beg leave respectfully to report that is impracticable to render any inspection reports of the Army of Tennessee for the month of October, 1864. Since the 29th of September this army has been marching from fifteen to twenty miles a day. The campaign is still going on. General Hood unites with me in saying that these reports, cannot be rendered, and hopes this statement of facts will satisfy you that it is impracticable to do so. When you hear from me next, I hope it will be in the heart of Tennessee, after Sherman is whipped and the State reclaimed. The army is a unit, and buoyant with hope.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. J. HARVIE,

Colonel and Assistant Inspector -General, Army of Tennessee.

I must have twenty days' supply of rations for this army of Cherokee with the least possible delay. Please give me all assistance you can in transportation them to that point, and allow the trains from your road to run direct to Cherokee Station, which will avoid transshipment at Corinth; time is of the utmost importance.

J. B. HOOD,
