ence, clothing and pay for time they may be in actual service. Many of them are very poor. Taking other troops would help rather than hinder me. I would keep the smallest number in service that could protect the country.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, December 18, 1862.

Major-General CURTIS, Saint Louis, Mo.:

It is the President's wish that the Mississippi expedition be made as effective as possible by re-enforcements from Helena; but it is not intended to weaken your forces there, so as to endanger any necessary operation in Arkansas. If the movement into Arkansas cannot wait for the result of the other, it must be made; but it is inexpedient to undertake too much at once, if it can be avoided. Please state how many troops you propose to retain in Arkansas.

General-in-Chief.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Camp Prairie Grove, December 18, 1862.

Major-General CURTIS, Saint Louis, Mo.:

There is no doubt but that Hindman has moved all his infantry force over the Arkansas River. The citizens of Van Buren and Fort Smith are leaving and traveling south. Hindman's headquarters are at Van Buren, while Marmaduke, with a cavalry force, is also on this side. The Arkansas River, with a cavalry force, is also on this side. The Arkansas River is very high; now is the time for Steele. Colonel Orme left for Van Buren yesterday with a flag of truce.

HDQRS. 2nd AND 3rd DIVISIONS, ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Prairie Grove, December 18, 1862.

Major-General CURTIS, Saint Louis, Mo.:

The location of the rebel forces is settled beyond the question of a doubt. They are camped half way between Van Buren and Fort Smith, on the south side of the river. Two regiments of cavalry are on this side of the river, on outpost duty, and one regiment of infantry, with three pieces of artillery, is in Van Buren. Hindman and Marmaduke are detachment to keep their own persons, safe, and are with the main body of infantry on the other side of the river. They have given up all hope of getting any farther, and say they will be satisfied if they can hold the Arkansas River. They are living on corn alone. Among the rebel officers killed in the battle of Prairie Grove was Lieutenant-Colonel Chappel, from Saint Louis County. He was in Steen's regiment. Governor Claib. Jackson died about days ago at Little Rock, of cancer. This may be old news to you, but has just reached us.

Our wounded are getting on well.

F. J. HERRON,

Brigadier-General.
