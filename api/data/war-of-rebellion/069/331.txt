General S. WILLIAMS:

GENERAL: My signal officers deserve especial commendation to-day. Lieutenant William Niel [Lieutenant William H. R. Neel, Ninety-fifth Pennsylvania Infantry] and Lieutenant Holland remained at the station on top of Colonel Shelton's house during the whole day. The house was struck by 51 artillery shots, and both the officers were struck and bruised by shell. A large family of ladies were in the cellar of the house during the shelling, but I had last night advise them to leave, and did so repeatedly to-day, offering them facilities for so doing, which they refused, trusting in God, as they were members of the church. I have sent my report of operations this evening by an orderly. Presume it has reached you by this.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
