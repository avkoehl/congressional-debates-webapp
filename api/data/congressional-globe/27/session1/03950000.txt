will compel us to resort again to the public credit
for means to defray the expenses of the Govern-
ment Tnere Is certainly, then, no surplus for
distribution to the Stales.
Another i dmission, equally material, is that eve-
ry dollar taken from the public Treasury by tHs
bit!, must be supplied, dollar for dollar, by new
taxation, or further loans, to enable that Treasury
to meet the calls, upon it for the or Jinary expenses
of the Government. This admission is proved
by the fact, that the bill to impose the taxes is now
before u% and treading upon our heels, while we
are voting this gratuity to the States Tne advo-
cates of that b 11 pres  it upon us, and declare that
it is intended to supply to the Treasury the money
which this measure takes from it I am autho-
rized, therefore, to make the declaration that the
revenue, or tax bill, isarianged to meet this gra u-
lty to the Stales, and that su Ji is its design and ob-
ject.
A still further admission is made as proved by
the recorded votes ot t! e Senate, m the course of
its ac ion upon ih's bill Tms admission is that,
in case of need, th* money to make this distribu-
tion is to be borrowed upon the credit of the people
of the United States, and an addition to the exist-
ing public debt to be made to accomplish this ©b
]ect, equal to the amount of the sum to be distri-
buted I re'er to the repeated piopositions offered
to amend the bill so as to Redare that the distribu-
tion should not be mad , when a resorr to loans
and an increase of the public debt should be the
necessary consequence, and to the recorded votes
of the Senators, by which every ¡>uch amendment
has been rejected, as the highest proof of this ad-
mission.
These are but repetitions of remarks which have
been repeatedly made in the course of the debate,
but I prefer to put them in the dist net form here
given I have to add that most of the further
points which I had proposed to myself to di cus«,
have been better presented by those vho have pre-
ceded me, and lhat I am tnus relieved from a te-
dious argument
I had intended to have examined the financial
policy of levying taxes to raise money for dislri-
bution, and to have shown that the least loss to the
community mast be the expense of collecting the tax,
say from five to ten per cent upon the money thus
accumulated, but this point ha"> been fully exa
mined by the honorable Senator from South Caro-
lina [Mr. Calhoun] on yesterday, and again, to-
day, by the honoraftle Senator fromNe  Hamp-
shire, [Mr. Woodbury,] and I can add nothing to
the views they have presented
There is a further aspect of 'he case in th  same
connection, however, which I believe they did not
present, and which shows a fur'her consequsnt loss
to the people generally, to follow from this mis
taken policy, as certain and perhaps much more
extensive, though not as general, as that
of the cost of collection of the tax I refer
to the influence of the protective duties which
this distribution bill may make it necessary*
that we should impose or continue Tne
statement of the proposition will be the proof of its
soundness It we raise a revenue By a duly upon
an article of import, whici comes m competition
with an article of domestic manutacture, tte reces
sary consequence is, taat ihe price ot the domestic
article in the market is raised to the price ot the
imported ariiile, while tie price ot th  latter nu?t
be regulated by th<¡ duty imposed upon it, that du-
ty being a part of the cost in our market This
increase oí the price of the domestic article to its
consumer, in eonsequenc of the duty upon the fo-
reign competing imported article, is an entire loss
to the community, as the excess of price goes into
the pocket of the domestic manufacturer, and not
into the public Treasury, ard therefore, while it ¡s
taken from the pockets of the people, doe;, not con-
tribute to the distribution fund, or m any way aid
the policy which causes it To this extent, then,
this bill must tax the country without any benefit
to its own policy, and for the mere advantage of
the manufacturing interests Is this one of the ob
jects ot i's faends, and one of the elements of its
support?
In the same connection is another tendency of

thi¡> measure. The d stnbution is to the States in
theifcorporate capacities, and the avewed object
and great purpose is to aid and assist and strength-
en the sinking credit of the debtor States, to give
them something to meet the claims for interest
now making against them upon existing loans,
something towards the payment of their debts al-
ready contracted. This is proposed to be done by
the indirect application of the powers of this Go-
vernment to imDose taxes in the shape of duties
t4pon imporis The honorable Senator from Vir-
ginn, [Mr Archer] in his argument, has discuss
ed the relative tend mcies of the two modes of taxa-
tion, the direct and indirect, and has told us with
great confidence, that the indirect is far the cheap-
est of the two It is far the most insidious, far
the least palpable in its exactions and oppressions,
far the least likely to incur the cen.ure and con-
demnation of a vigilant and jealous people, but
that it is even the chtapest is yet to be shown 'o
my satisfaction. That v* the most dangerous, the
most unequal, and the most unjust, and most esne-
cially when applied to the existing State debts, is
easily demonstrable
Upon what are these debts a charge now?
Upon the taxable property of the Siate which has
contracted and owes th m If the S aie be let
to pay them, ihe taxes to meet the payments
must be levied up >n that property, and it wdl be
made to pay the debts in just proportions Thei
the man worth one hundred thousand dollars
will pay one hundr d tir c¡s as much as th- min
worth but oii£ thousand dollars. Ton will be a
j ist measure of payment, especially so for the
existing State debts These debts have been con-
tracted, almost without a solatary ewpt 0.1, to
construci works of internal mprovement, roads,
canals, and railroads, with n the indebted S ates
The gmjtest benefit nought and expected from
these works is the increased value they give to the
property, ?nd especia'ly to ihe soil of the Slate
Thai p-operty, therefore, and esp°cially tha* soil,
with its enhanced value, ar  the peculiarly aopro
pnate objects for taxation to pay the expenses of
these works, and the d*bts contracted for their con
struclion. In this way, andm this way only, can
the proper connection between the burdens and
benefits of tae internal improvement policy be pre-
served.
What classes of the cifzens of a Stale are pecu-
liarly and permanently benefited by these works'
Is it not the property holders, and most especially
the owners oí real estate' And should not ih'y be
made to pay at least their proportion of the tax ac
cording to the increased value of their property,
when taxes must be levied to pay for and «¡up-
port the works? Of what benefit are th- canals
and railroads of a State to its day laborers
who are without property? They may be ca'ea
lated to cheapen to such a man, to a very limited
extent the necessaries of life, but the probabilities
are that the wages of his labor will be made to
conform to any influence of that so t, so as to
leave him exactly where he would have been with-
out such improvement Should he, then, be made
to pay equally with the man of wealth, the ex
tensive planter and landholders towards th" taxes
which the construction of theie woiks has ren
dered necessa y? Ln h m pay aecordng to his
«¡ubstanc, his Uxabie property, and should he
pay more? Will equality and jus ice take more
from him'   Most certainly not
And jet he pou;y of this bill is to take more,
much more, from him, to tax him equally with
the man of wealth and the extensive ouner ol
real estate Its effect is to be to relieve the pro
perty of the State from the tax and impo e 1', per
cipita, upon the citizens Instead of levying it
upon the lands and goods of the citizens at iheir
fairly a sessed values it Is to be er Kely levied
upon the necessan s of life, which tat poor mus
consume equally with th" nch, upon tie e* an
coffee and sugar and salt which are upo*> the t?-
bles of all, and which in this country, anl under
our institution*-, should be permitted to remain
upon the tables of all Wha' equality, what jus
tice, is there m sueh a measure of taxation f¡ r
such an object' In thus levying taxes to pay
for canals and railroads, which are to   enhance
to the man of wealth the value oí his possessions,
while they wholly supersede the employment of
many clas-es of laborers? Undsr this mode of
collecting the taxes to pay for lh«e "works, the man
worth his hundred thousand dollars may, nay, in
thousands of instance  will, be made to pay a
le«s sum than the man worth one thousand dollars,
ay, than the man not worth one cent of property
in the world, and whose hands are his only for-
tun'-. The poor have wives and children and fa-
milies as well as the rich, and those wives and
children and families must be clothed and fed.
They must have tea, and coffee, and sugar, and
salt, and they sliould have them, for ihe time has
gone by, m this country, when these articles are to
be talked about as luxuries Toey are among our
necessaries of most universal consumption, and
must and 1 hould remain so, and yet they are to be
selected as the objects for taxauon to raise money
to pay the debts of the States, contracted to con-
struct work  of internal improvement, designed and
calcu ated only to benefit those who hold property.
The taxing power of this Go vernmentis to be diverted
from its legitimate exercise to raise Federal reve-
nue, and is to be wielded for the sole and exclusive
use and benefit of the States, and that, too, in a
wav to work this flagiant mequa'ity, and injustice,
and cruelty, and all this is to be done to shield the
members, of the State Legislatures from the unpo-
pularity of exercising the equitable taxing power of
the r rtspective States, and to protect the properly
holders of the States from the payment of their ju«t
proportion of the taxes required to liberate tbeir
Sta^e Governments from the embarrassments into
which toe fostering of their interests bas involved
them
I am aware, Mr President, that this bill is to
pass this body, and that it is to become, in some
form, the law of the land It is too late to reason
aga nst the combination of interests, pecuniary and
political, which are bearing forward this monstrous
policy, bat can a wr.e and just people give to it
their sanction? Will they consent to grind the poor
in o the dust by taxition, or deprive ihem of every
comfort, that the rich may escape a just burden? I
hope and trust not
My principal object in rising was to call the at-
tention of the Senate, of the House, of the Presi-
den , and of the country, to two of the provisions
of ihis bill, which have not been commented upon
in a manner to sausfy my mind, and which, if there
be any sort of relationship between this measure
and the Constitution, it appears to me must stamp
it wnh palpable and flagrant unconstitutionality
I refer, first, to the rule of distribution The bill
came here from the House of Representatives with
a correct constitutional rule, if, indeed, there can
be any constitutional rule for giving money from
the Federal Treasury to the States, which I not on-
ly do not admit, but positively deny Yet, admitting
for ibe sake of the argument, and I do even that
unwilknaly, that a distribution can be constitu-
tionally made, is there, can there be, a doubt that
the rule of distr buuon must be that of taxation to
be constitu'tonal? Do not let Senators forget that
the money distributed to the S ate Governments
under this bill is immediately to be collected from
the people of the Slates by taxation, and will it be
coniendeJ that each State should not receive what
its own people pay, subtracting the expenses of
collecting the tax'. Such was ihe provision of the
bill when it came'here. The distribution was to
be made upon the federal representative popu'a-
tion, which is the cons national basis for represen-
tation and taxation The Senate has thought it
wi«e to alter this rule, and dueci the di  nbution
to be made, not upon the basis of population and
taxation, but upon the federal representation in
the two Hou«ea of Corgr^ss ci-mb ned, thus draw-
