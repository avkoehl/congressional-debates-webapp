a Half company.

The aggregate of the firing was thus, as follows: 30-pounder Parrott, 447; 4 1/2-inch gun (Schenkl), 847; 13-inch mortar, 19; 10-inch mortar, 360; 8-inch mortar, 1,123; Coehorn mortar, 1,037-weighing over 75 tons.

In each of the 10-inch mortar shells about thirty 12-pounder canister shot were inserted with the bursting charge on top of them. Their effect was thus more than doubled.

At 11.30 p.m. of July 30 I received a telegram from yourself to withdraw all the train on the fronts of the Fifth and Ninth Corps, with a part of that on the Eighteenth Corps; all to be done with urgent haste. In obedience to this order fifty-two siege guns and mortars, with all their ammunition, implements, platforms, mantles, &amp;c., complete, were secretly withdrawn, from the batteries and transported a mean distance of about seven miles, to Broadway Landing, in twenty-seven hours; and the whole material, weighing some 225 tons, loaded on barges and schooners in thirty-six hours from the receipt of the telegram. For the transportation required, some 200 wagons I am indebted chiefly to Brigadier-General Ingalls, chief quartermaster, armies in the field, and in part to Colonel Piper, chief of artillery, Eighteenth Corps, who supplied light battery horse for seven siege guns.

During the service of the guns, the only injury which has occurred is the blowing off the muzzle of a 30-pounder Parrott for about one foot from the face. It was cut smooth with cold chisels, and the gun seems to be as accurate in its fire as heretofore. I have now in position on the Eighteenth Corps front three 30-pounder Parrotts, ten 8-inch mortars, and 16 Coehorn mortars. I shall send the 13-inch mortar back as soon as the track is repaired.

I have had reason to be gratified with the earnest exertions of the officers and men of my command, both my own regiment and the Fourth New York Artillery, to render the siege train as effective as possible, and hope that we have answered your expectations.
