228________________THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,                        February 11,
Senator intends to adopt as a permanent system
There is no other alternative, unless you devote
the road itself to destiuction. This idea no gen
tleman can one moment entertain The erection
of toil gates under the authority of Congress is
now out of the question
But it is said that the sum of $300,000 was
appropriated at the last ses&ion tor the entire
completion of the repairs of this road, and that
more ought not now to be demanded Is theie
any force in this argument5 In settling an account
with individuals, where the claimant is an oppo-
sing party, is it very proper for Congiesslo say
that the sum appropriated shall be in full of all
demands' Unless in very extraordinary cases, I
should never vote to reopen such an account and
grant a new appropriation But what is the s'ate
of facts upon the present occasion' Does not
this road belong to the United States' Are we
not bound by high principles of public duty to
keep it in repair' Here is no opposite ptuty
with whom we can drive a bargain. It is our
own road, and if we have not appropriated a
sufficient sum fonts repair, shall wesuffei it to go
to ruin, because we made a mistake in regard to
the amount necessary' If the simple declaration
of Congress, that $31)0,000 was sufficient, could
have rendered it so, then there might be some
justice in this reasoning, otherwise it is a mere
fallacy If, after having granted a certain sum,
which was found by experience to be wholly
insufficient to complete one of our fortifications,
what should we say to a gentleman who would
gravely contend that, as we had declared this sum
should accomplish the object, we would rather
permit it to go to rum than appropiiate another
dollar The cases are piecisely parallel But
this is not all Congress has contracted an obh
gation to the States through which this road
passes to put it in good and complete repair, how
can they acquit themselves from this obligation by
urging that they had appropriated a sum which
they .declared to be sufficient for this purpose,
and they could not, and would not, appropriate
any more'   The States thiough which the road
Easses would have a right to say, this was not the
argam; your mistake cannot justify the viola-
tion of your contract, you have agreed to accom-
plish a specific object, and cost what it may, this
object must be accomplished, or we shall not accept
the surrender of the road
The commissioners appointed under the act of
the Legislature of Pennsylvania have pledged
themselves in the most solemn manner to accept
the load, and erect toll gates upon it, as soon as
Congress shall appropriate the sum deemed neces-
sary by the engineer department to put it in re-
pair That sum is granted by this bill Pass it,
and I will undertake to say for Pennsylvania that
this perplexing question, which has so often and
for so many years agitated Congress, will be put
forever at rest You will nevei more hear of this
road, unless it be that it has been preserved and
protected with that fostering care which Pennsyl-
vania exercises over all interests in which eithei
the citizens of the State or of the Union are deeply
corc^rned
Mr. PRESTON said he was tired of making
these repeated appropriations, again and again,
for an object which he believed was originally
unconstitutional He was disposed to vote some
thing to get rid of this incubus u pon the Treasury,
if it was possible to effect it, but he was by no
means satisfied that this appiopnation would en-
able us to get it off our hands He did not know
or understand by what new lights gentlemen were
governed heretofore upon this matter, but he
would now ask the honorable chairman whether
lie would use in his place and say that the appro-
priation asked for would be sufficient to put the
road in repair ' For himself, he did not think it
would, but that applications would yet be made
for the same purpose, year after j ear We could
not get rid of the road in any way, neither by
selling it, giving it away, or losing it These
States would not take the road, or maintain it,
beeause it was left to their own judgments to say
whether it was in repair or not
Mr EWING contended that the resetvation of
the two per cent fund to the new States, of which
Ohio was one, was by a compact made in 1802,
and was expressly for the purpose of making
roads This road was made by these funds, and
yet the gentleman from South Carolina said that
expenditures had been made to the road again
and again Could the load (he asked) be main-
tained but by appropriations' If it passed thiough
a rich country, it might be repaired by the popu'a-
tion, but it passed, in great part, over mountains
and through wildernesses, and must necessarily
get out of ordei The gentleman said that nenher
of the States would maintain it, but the States
had agreed to take it when it was put into com-
plete repan This never had oeen done, and they
could not be expected to take it, and maintain it
when it was worn out Ohio had already ex-
pended large sums m repamng it, and if this sum
should be expended, he had infoimation that no
further appropnation would heieafter be asked for
from Congress for the purpose.
Mr BUCHANAN rose to say but one or two
words He did not know to whom the honor-
able Senator from South Carolina alluded by the
new lights which, he said, had influenced gentle-
men Ceitainly he could not have meant him, foi
no new light had burst on his vision since 1822
Whether that gentleman had seen any himself
since that period ,*he would not pretend to say,
but from the session of 1822-'23, he (Mi B ) bad
been uniform, zealous, and consistent in his oppo-
sition to all the attempts which had been made to
establish toll gates on this road by Congress He
had at length, much against his inclination, voted
in opposition to appropriations for its repair, in
order to compel its friends to apply to the States
to erect toll gates upon it He thought, ftom the
tenor of the honorable gentleman's lemaiks, he
had not read the documents in this case with
much care He would mqune of the gentleman,
candidly, would South Carolina, under similai
circumstances, take this road under her charge,
and agree to keep it in repair, when it was in such
a condition that it must go to ruin, unless $340,000
should be expended upon it' Could he expect
Pennsylvania to take the road, when the officers
of this Government declared that it was not in
repair' Six hundred and fifty-two thousand dol-
lars was the sum asked for at the last session,
§300,000 of which only had been granted It was
the mere balance of the former sum which was
now asked, and, if it was appropriated, he for
one was willing to pledge himself he would nevet
vote for a single dollar more for the purpose
With respect to the special terms in which the
appropriation of last session was made, he would
ask the gentleman, suppose he were building a
house, and he should give a specific sum of money
to his agent for its completion, and declaie this
was sufficient, and it should afterwards appear
that it was entuely insufficient foi the purpose,
would he allow it to remain useless, and go to
decay, or would he advance an additional sum to
finish it' Either we must abandon this road to
rum, or we shall be obliged to make a much
greater appropriation at the next session, if this
be now refused
Mr PRESTON contended that it was for a
Pennsylvania road we were making this appro-
priation, it was not for our house, it was not our
road, and if there was this gieat amount of travel-
ling on it which gentlemen said, it proved its
value, and that the States in which it laid might
derive an income from it He supposed the hon-
orable gentleman fiom Pennsylvania never enter-
tained but one opinion upon these matters, but
the gentlemen with whom he usually acted enter-
tained different opinions as to the power of Con-
gress to establish toll gates on th"6 road He made
no opposition, however, to the appropriation west
of the Ohio He therefore moved to amend the i
bill by striking out the second and third sections,
upon which motion he asked the yeas and nays,
which were ordered
[The second section appropriates $346,000 to
the repairs ofrthe road east of the Ohio
The third section provides that when the road
shall be completed, it shall be surrendered to the
States in which it lies ]
Mr WEBSTER said, if he had the same con    I
stitutional scruples with regard to the power of the
United States to construct roads, as the Senator
from South Carolina, [Mr. Pueston,] he should
reason in the same manner and come to the same
results But he had no doubt on that subject
And moreover, the Cumberland road was of more
general mteiest, and less, local in Us natuie, than
most subjects that had been objected to as uncon-
stitutional
There were (bald Mr W ) two objects em-
biaced in the bill One to cany forward the road
beyond the Ohio liver and extend it to the new
States m the we&t—the other, to appropriate
$350,000 for íepairs on this side of that river, in
older to put it in a condition to induce the States
I to accept it and keep it in lepair Aftei the enor-
mous expense the Government had incurred in
! constructing the road, Mr W contended it should
j be preserved He agieed foi the most pait with
I the honorable Senator fiom Pernsylvama, [Mr
Bucha\a\ ] He understood, by the provis,ons
of the bill, that the States to which it would be
surrendered, were bound to apply the revenues
of the tolls solely to the repairs of the road He
was in favor at the last session of appropiiatmg
$600,000 for these repairs, but the other House
thought otherwise Consequently the bill was
amended by changing the sum fiom $600,000 to
$300,000 He was in favor of appropriating the
full sum at that time, and then have the road
finished
Mr CLAY said he should vote for the bill He
felt an imperative duty to preserve what was
already done on the road, and prevent the whole
from being lost He did not, however, agree with
the honorable Senator from Ohio, [Mr Ewmg,]
that the Government was pledged to continue
the repairs of the road, because a share in the
incomes of public lands had been granted in lieu
thereof He contended that the power to con-
struct a load implied a power to preserve it, and
the best way to pi eserve it was to erect toll gates
and apply the income to that object He theie-
fore saw no objection to setting up toll gates un-
der the authority of the United States lie had
not stood alone in that opinion, a large majority of
the Senate concuired with him at that time His
opinions were still the same, and he still believed
the power existed in the Constitution, but the
expediency of resoiting to it wat, guarded by
popular opinion Heconsidered that road a great
national object, a great national thoroughfare for
all the States He contended against the propri-
ety of surrendering the road to the States It was
giving the privileges of the nation away to com-
munities whose interest was distinct, who had no
sympathies, no common feelings, with the rest
We migbt as well surrender the care of the Mint
or any public works, to individual States, as that
road He felt compelled to vote for the bill Times
had changed' He had seen the bank, internal
improvements, and other great national objects,
compelled, of late, to march to the right or left,
according to the will of those high in authority.
Mr WRIGHT did not rise, he said, to debate
the bill. He only wished for some modifications,
as the bill was, he saw no prospect of getting rid
of the road, there was no surety that the same
demand would not be made again next year
Mr HILL said he had the bill before him as it
came from the House last year He did not
believe another dollar should be expended The
bill was passed at the last session with the under-
standing that it was the last expenditure that
would be asked for But there it was again, and
no security against still further demands It was
contended that the sum was not sufficient—when
would it be sufficient' Millions had already been
expended upon this expensive undertaking and
he saw no end to the prodigality and waste of the
public treasures He for one could not vote for
any appropriation under such circumstances.
Mr. BUCHANAN said he did not rise to say
another word on the merits of this appropriation,
but merely to make a brief reply to the Senator
from Kentucky He found himself between two
fires from opposite sides of the Senate "W hilst
the gentleman from South Carolina [Mr Preston]
thinks I go too far in favor of internal lmpnne-
ments, the gentleman from Kentucky blames me
for not going far enough. On this subject they
are the opposite extremes For his own part,
between the two, he should adopt the maxim, "in
medio tutisstmus zbts."   Heshould certainly follow
