April; but as a body I do not believe there exists a brigade more cheerful under privations or more courageous in action. I have spoken of only one brigade, though a division commander, the Louisiana cavalry brigade assigned to me not having served under my command in a ny of the actions referred to.

Colonels Carter and Parsons, between whom there is a question of disputed precedence, have both at times commanded the brigade, Colonel Parsons commanding (Colonel Carter having temporarily waived his claim) until taken sick about May 1, and again part of the day on the 5th, Colonel Carter being brigade commander during his absence until May 13, during which time several engagements took place on Bayou Rapides, in which my whole force participated, particularly on the 5th, 6th, and 7th.

Colonel Parsons, during the time he was in command on Bayou Rapides, and afterward from Polk's plantation to the final engagement of the 18th, maintained the uniform steadiness which the commanding general had an opportunity of observing while in the immediate command of the troops in the rear of the retreating enemy.

HEADQUARTERS STEELE'S DIVISION OF CAVALRY,June 6, 1864.

COLONEL: In sending up my report of actions from Grand Ecore down, which was made up amid a press of other business, I omitted to mention, as I intended to, the artillery officers who from time to time served under my command. Of these Captain Moseley was longest with me, and deserves especial mention for the manner in which he fought his battery. His officers and men behaved well, with the exception of Lieutenant Cooper, whose case has already been brought to your notice. Captain West, though with me but one day,was hotly engaged, and is, with his officers and men, entitled to much praise. Lieutenant Hume, with a section of the Valverde Battery, only was with the troops under my command during the pursuit from Alexandria, during which time Lieutenant Hume distinguished himself for the promptness with which he brought his section into action, his coolness under fire, and generally the skillful handling of his pieces.
