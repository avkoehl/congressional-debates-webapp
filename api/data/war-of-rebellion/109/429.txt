Following, by courier from Colonel Bradley, just received.

Reports about 20,000 men around Chattanooga, and that the enemy have no bridge laid, but have pontoons tied to shore. They are throwing up heavy works on the east and north, but have no defenses on this side. He reports also that two Mississippi regiments mutinied and stacked their arms three days since. All quiet in this neighborhood-Bridgeport.
