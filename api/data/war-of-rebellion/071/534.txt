Vaughn near Hagerstown, McCausland passed through Mercersburg to my right and rear and burned the town of Chambersburg. He intended to burn Carlisle and strike the Pennsylvania Railroad. He would have burned this place also, but for my arrival. From this point they proposed to go via Bedford to Wheeling, but changed their route upon my arrival. Their force is about 2,600, with four guns. They will try to cross at Hancock. Can you do anything to prevent it? Several of their officers and men have been killed and captured.

Major-General COUCH:

Overtook McCausland at McConnellsburg this morning at 8 a. m., and am pressing him in the direction of Hancock. Several of this officers and men have been killed and captured. He has burned houses all along the road, and was about to burn McConnellsburg when I arrived. From here the enemy proposed to go via Bedford to Wheeling, but changed his route on my attack. My command was broken down before I started, but we are making as good time as possible.
