114                                         APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
25th Cong....3d Sess.
about the state of facts, and the condition of the
Tieasury, on the 1st day of January, 1837,
though I have not looked at the figures for this
occasion, and, speaking from memoiy, may not
be precisely accurate During this session of Con-
gress, a report was loccivcd from the Secretary ¡
of the Treasury, detailing the eifoits which had
been made under the law of 1836 to liquidate,
settle, and secure the bank debt, gmng tne then
state of the negotiation, and showing that no defi-
nite or satisfactory result had been reached It
appealed, however, that examinations had been
made, facts ascertained, and conclusions formed,
as to the fair value of the interest of the United
States arising fiom their stock, and that distinct
offers to sell the claim to the new Pennsylvania
Bank, at a given price, and upon specified terms,
as to time and interest, had been made by the
commissioners appointed by the Secretary, but
that no answeis had been obtained to their prop-
ositions.
After this report was laid before Congress and
the public, the board of directois of this Pennsyl-
vania bank, through their president, addressed a
memorial to Congress, giving their acceptance of
one of the offers which had been made to them,
and Congress, on the 3d of Maich, 1837, passed i
a concurrent resolution, directing the becietnry j
of the Tieasury to take the security offered, and
close the business
The whole value of the claim, as liquidated by
the offerand acceptance, was §7,946,356 16 This
was the amount conceded to have been due to the
United States on the day after the expnation of
the charter of the bank as a national institution—
the 4th day of March, 1836, and, by theteimsof
the baigain, payment was to be made in foui
equal installments of $1,986,589 04 each, the fiist
to be r)aid m the month of September, 1837, and
the remaining three installments in one, two, and
three years fro-n that time, with lnteiestuponthe
whole amountfrom and after the 3d day of March,
1836, until paid, at tlio rate of six per centum pci
annum Tne Secretary pioceeded to carry into
effect the resolution of Congress, to ascertain the
amounts as above stated, and to take the bonds
of the United States Bank of Pennsylvania tose
cure the payments, that being the security agreed
to be given by tht terms of the acceptance
In tins way the claim of the Uniti d States was
transferred fiom the Bank of the United States
chaVtered by Congiess, to that chai tend by the
State of Pennsyl van la, and thus the bonds against
the latter institution, which have given rise to the
transactions principally complained of, came into
existence These bonds were each for the came
amount, ($1,986,589 04) Each beai an interest
of six per centum per annum from the 3d day of
March, 1836, and the first was payable in all the
month of September, 1837, the second m 1838, the
third in 1839, and the fourth in 1840, All these
bonds bear date on the 10th (lay of May, 1837, and
it is impossible not to maik singular coincidence
of dates between the conclusion of this negotia
tion, which postponed the payment, and placed
beyond thepowei and contioloftheTreasury this
almost eight million dollars, and that universal
suspension of specie payments by the banks of the
country, which instantly depmed the Treasury
of means to pay the public creditors, and com
pelled an extra call of Congress I have stated that
the bonds were dated on the 10th day of May,
1837 They were, therefore, executed onthatday,
either at Washington or Philadelphia, while at
New York,on the very same day, specie payments
were suspended I speak from recollection upon
this pomt, but feel suie that the suspension took
place at New York on the 10th of May 1837, and
it was certainly followed, almost instantly, where
it had not been preceded, by nearly e\ ery banking
institution in the whole Union 'A consequence
of this was to render unavailable, for legal pay
ments, all the balances in the deposit banks, and
to thow back upon the Treasury, thus depuved
of its means, masses of outstanding drafts which
had been drawn upon these deposits, but which
had not reached their places of destination, and
been presented for payment, when the suspension
was pioelaimed At this crisis the bank debt
would have been a most timely and important aid,
if it could have been realized jn cash, but the con-
summation, on the very day of the suspension by i
Is of United States Bank—Mr. Wri¿
the banks, of the terms of compiomise, tendered
on the part of the Government when the Tieasury
was more than full, and accepted by the bank
several months after it was tendered, had post
poned payment upon this debt foi one, two, three,
and fouryeais
Under circumstances like these, the proclama-
tion of the PresUent was issued, beanng date on
the 15th of May, 1837, and calling a special
meeting of Congress for September of that year
The deposits with the States, to be made on the
1st of January and 1st of Apnl, of between nine
and ten million dollars each, had been neatly
completed, and diafts had been issued for the
principal part, if not foi the whole, of the deposit
of like amount to be made on the 1st of July,
when the suspension of specie payments by the
banks placed the very moneys out of which these
deposits were to be made beyond the contiol of
the law, or of the fiscal officeis of the Govern-
ment The consequence was, that many of the
outstanding drafts for the July deposit,and some
few of those for the previous installments, were
dishonored by the banks upon which they were
diawn, and returned upon the Treasury for pay
ment, while the whole means of the fieasuiy to
meet these and other payments weie locked up in
the banks Hence the aid of Congiess was in
voked at the earliest piacticable pcnod, and the
ability of the Tieasuiy to get on until the com
mencement of the extra session was rendeied
extiemely doubtful So rapid was oui tiansi-
tion, in a public sense, fiom superabundant
wealth to extreme poverty, from plethoric full-
ness in the public Treasury to extreme want and
almost perfect destitution'
It will now be proper to see what legislation
was adopted by Congress affecting the public
Treasury, at the extia session of September and
October, 1837 In the way of supply, a bill wis
passed, on the 12th day of Octobei, authorizing
the Secietary of the Treasury to issue papti,
upon the cieclit of the Government, in the shape
of Tieasuiy notes, us the wants of the Tieasuiy
should require, not to exceed, m all, the amount
of ten million dollars, but with such restuctions
in the law as to prohibit the reissue of any ¡single I
note which ¡should fill into the hands of an officei
of the Government, in payment to the United
States, while all the notes wtie made a legal tendel
for all such payments
On the other hand, nearly every ordinary re-
souice of the Tieasuiy was cut off, for a penod,
by a law which suspended, for the space of nine
months after maturity, all payments upon all out-
standing duty bonds, and gave a credit of thiee
and six months upon such cash duties as had
become due and were unpaid, or should become
due upon importations to be made previous to
the month of November, 1837, and by another
law, which, at the option of the deposit banks,
suspended payment upon the balances due from
them for previous deposits, for periods of eight,
fourteen, and twenty months, and íequired that
the bonds of the institutions for payment, at the
expnation of those periods, of equal thud paits
of their íespective debts, satisfactorily secuied,
should be received in lieu of payments in hand
Anothei law wis also passed at this extra ses-
sion, materially affecting the Treasury m both
directions I allude to the law " postponing the
payment of the fourth installment of deposits with
the States " This law relieved the Treasury from
this call of between nine and ten million dolíais,
until the 1st day of January, 1839, but it, at the
same time, piohibited the Treasurer from draw-
ing, under any encumstances or for any purpose,
upon the §28,000,000 which had been previously
deposited with the States in obedience to the pro-
visions of the deposit law of 1836 Its effect,
thciefore, was to deprive the Tieasury of three
dollars of means foi every dollar of demand from
which it was relieved
With the exception of the necessary appropri-
ations made at the extra session, no othei legis-
lation materially affecting the public Treasury has
been discovered
I will now pass on to the annual session of
Congress of 1837-38, and see in what manner the
legislation of that session was made to influence
the operations of the Treasury    On the 21st of i
May, 1838, a law passed giving to the Secretary |
Senate.
of the Treasui y the power to issue new Treasury
notes in the place of all those which, having been
issued undei the law of the extra session, had
been paid in and canceled, oi should be so paid in
and canceled undei the piovisions of that law
The same prohibition, howevei,against a reissue
of the new no'es was retained in the law of
1838, while these notes also were made a legal
tender in all public payments
The only other legislation of this session, in-
tended foi the supply of the Treasury, was the
law of the 7th of July, 1838, authorizing a sale,
in the maiket, of the two bonds against the Bank
of the United States of Pennsylvai la, which were
to become due and payable in Septembei, 1839
and 1840, being the thud and fouuh of the four
bonds taken, in the manner before íelated, to se-
cure the debt due to the United States fiom the
late Bank of the United States, chai tered by Con-
giess, foi the stock held by the United States in
that institution at the time of the expiration of
its charter It will be remembered that the first
bond was made payable m September, 1837, which
tune had passed, and that bond had been paid,
and canceled The second bond, made payable
in Septembei, 1S38, would fall due so soon after
the passage of thi law, that it was not thought
advisable to include in it a piovision foi its sale,
as the money might be received upon it fiom us
matuuty, befoie a negotiation for the sale could
bebiought to a successful termination Hence
the law piovided foi the sale of the two last bonds-
only, and this 1 iw it is, and the practical execu-
tion of it by the Secretary, which has given use
to this discussion, and now compels me to ob-
trude myself upon the attention of the Senate
Hie law made the Secretary of the Tieasuiy
the agent of the Government for the sale of the
bonds, limited him to the par value of each bond
in the maiket, " calculated according to the rules
foi estimating the par value of securities upon
which inteiest has run for a time, but which se-
curities have not reached maturity," opened to
him the markets of oui own and foreign coun-
tues,and duected that the sale should be made
" foi money in hand "
11ns bungs me to an examination of the fact 
m i elation to the execution of this law, and for
them I must refer to the reports undei consider-
ation, and to the documents accompanying them.
Fiom this time foiwaid I shall, as far as piacti-
cable, let the reports and the correspondence speak
for themselves, as, notwithstanding the tedious-
ness to myself and the Senate of leading docu-
ments here, I prefer that the facts themselves,
and the language of the parties, lather than my
undeistanding of either, should guide the judg-
ment of this body and the country upon the issue
piesentcd
It will be proper here to remaik that but one
of the bonds authorised to be sold has as yet
been sold under the law, the bond to become due
in Septembei of the present year, that to fall due
in September, 1840, being yet held by the Tieas-
ury as the property of the United States It
will, howevei, be seen that various negotiations,
all at the instance of the bank, have been carried
on between that institution and the Secretaiy of
the Tieasuiy, the object of which was to anange
the mode and manner of payment of the second
bond, to fall due in September, 1838, and, as an
inducement to the officers of the Treasury to yield
to the mode and manner desired by the bank,
offering, on its part, to anticipate portions of that
payment at times which should be most desnable
to the Government, in reference to the calls for
public disbursement It is indispensable to a
perfect understanding of the tran&actions, that
the negotiations for tins object, and those for the
sale of the third bond under the law before re-
ferred to, should not be confounded, while the
dates and order and manner of the correspond-
ence upon the two subjects, and the similarity of
the propositions from the bank in both cases,
require some care to preserve the separation per-
fectly, and at the same time to comprehend the
whole force of the facts as applicable to each
transaction
Hence I propose to examine all the facts in re-
lation to the time, mode, and manner of payment
of the second bond, due m September, 183a, and
which was not sold, before I refer to the facts at-
