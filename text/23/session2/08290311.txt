he would admit, would not destroy this trade, but
it would throw it into the hands of two countries
possessing a large commeicial marine, England
and Holland In ports where whole forests of
American masts were now seen there would be
scarcely a single ship owned by native Americans.
If we declared that we would have no further
negotiation, coupled with the recall of ourMmister,
it would be tantamount to a declaration of war
And for what' For what was considered almost
a desperate debt of five millions, most of which
had been long ago transferred from the original
creditor at some two or three shillings in the pound
Were two ancient allies to bnns upon themselves
all the dreadful and horrible consequences of a
war, a war that for consequences and dire calam-
ities would be unequalled in the page of history
upon so paltry a ground The case was dispro-
portionate with the effects, and had no prototype
in the whole annals of the civilized world It
would be quixotic, and even romance scarcely
presented a precedent, unless that of Sir Lucius
OTngger We were going to plunge intoa war,
not only with the greatest Power in the world, but
with one also with which we were united by long
bonds of friendship, to sustain the national glory
and honor' No, tbrthe paymentof a paltiy sum
of money, two-thirds of which the opposite party
were willing at once to pay It was ironically said
that "discretion was the better part of valor,"
but it did not thence follow that íashness was the
best proof of it If a giant Btruck him, was he
to rush upon him in return when he was certain
to be crushed to atoms' He denied that national
honor was yet involved in the question, and if it
was, could it be best maintained by bravado, vio-
lence, and intemperance'
Mr A then maintained that the treaty was in-
complete, because all the forms required under the
French charter had not been complied with The
Constitution of the United States vested the treaty-
makfng power in the Executive, but if he made a
treaty involving an approonation, it would be in-
valid till passed in the House of Representatives
of Congress All appropriations must emanate
from the popular branch of the Government, and
the same was the case in France The Represent-
atives of the people held the purse strings Sup
pose the President of the United States made a
treaty, and that treaty involved an appropriation,
and that House refused to pass the bill for the
purpose, would there be any breach of national
faith ' None But he would say, he had rather
that not only fwe millions., but five hundied mil
lions should be sacrificed, rather than plunge the
country into the calamities that must inevitably
ensue from the course he reprobated
Mr A said he had just been mfoimed that ad-
vices had arrived to day, from France, which gave
strength to the hope heretofore enteitained that
our affairs in the French Chamoers had resulted
favorably He would ask the gentleman from
New York, if, under such circumstances, he would
deem his resolution eithei expedient or politic'
The gentleman from Massachusetts said something
about fear
Mr ADAMS remarked, that the whole of the
gentleman's atgumentwas fear
Mr ARCHER admitted it He feared the
dire calamities that wouid fall upon u«, by adopt-
ing the course recommended in both series of the
resolutions presented that morning
Mr CAMBRCLFNG said, as the gentleman
had refened to some iecent advice", he shou'd be
glad to be informed of their purport
Mr  ARCHCR understood the project of a law
presented   by   tne  Mm ster  of Finance  to   the
Fiench Chambers had  been refened to the Bu
reau, or Standing Committee of the Chamber
Mr    A    then   aliudcd   to  the  iererence often
made by nations to neutral Poweis, when ques-
tions of temtoiy,il.c , were invohed, in prooUhat
this   subject might, also,  without  infringing on
nalfcmal honoi, be in a like mannei disposed of
What had we to fear from negotiation 01 to arbi
tration '   Nothu g     He  be'ieved we should lose
no portion of the money, but on the contrary, he
should expect agieat deal noie would be asked, I
and obtained     lie «anted Fiance and the wond
to see that nothing had been left undone on our I
part to prevent a lesort to arms, and that il we I
weie foiceil to it, we should go into it with clean i
hands Heapplauded the «pint of the gentleman
from Massachusetts, and if that gentleman thought
the national honor insulted, Mr A admired that
spirit, but he denied that the occasion called for
it We were not to drench the country with
oceans of blood, because theautocrat of our coun-
try had a spirit which might become him Mr
A came there not to exalt the honor of that indi-
vidual, but to protect the interests of his constit-
uents and of the country at large
Mr A concluded by offering the following
amendment to the amendment of Mr Adams.
Resolved, That in the just expectation that the
Government of France will have made provision,
or will make provision for carrying into effect the"
stipulations of the treaty of indemnity with that
Government of the 4th ot July, 1831, this House
will forbear at the present time to adopt any
measujem relation to that subject
Mr PICKENS opposed both the resolutions
with considerable animation
Mr   PATTON addressed the House, at con-
siderable length, in reply to Messrs  Archer and
Pickens, and gave the views which had governed
I him in relation to this sulject, both in the Com
, mittee on Foreign Affairs, (of which he was a
member,) and m the House.    He did not fully
concur in all points with either of the series of
resolutions     Mr   P   read a resolution which he
had prepared on the subject, with a view of offer-
I mg it to the House     It would be seen that it was
I declarative oí the validity of our claim, and pre-
I served the principles advocated by the gentleman
from  Massachusetts    It was also; he thought,
couched in as strong terms as that gentleman
should require                                                              I
[The great length of Mr Patton's remarks pre- ¡
eludes even a synopsis, but we hope to givetl em
at length as soon as they can be piepared ]             I
j Mr BOULD1N said he hada few remaiksto
make on the subject He siid it was not his m-
I tention, nor had it been his habit, to trespass long
on the time of the House He wished to heai
what were the views of every member, ard "up
I posed that every member wished to understand
| the opinion and teelings of every one on the floor
I upon a subject of such magnitude He would not
at any time tiespasson the patience of the House,
much less would he at this time, lockirg to the
magnitude of this question, and the great press of
other business that must bedone in the short time
left of this session He thought there was but one '
question before this House and this nation m rela !
Hon to this «ulject, that was to be determined at
this time The questior whether this debt secured
by this treaty to be paid would be abandoned or
insisted on, other questions had been suggested
m Fiance and in this country, but no other ques-
tions had been made here The President had
advised means under certa n contingencies But
no other question had been raised by the consti
tuttd authouuesof t'us country but this Shall the
debt be abandoned or not' He said this was a
very material question to be decided 1 lie debates
in the French Chamber of Deputies showed that
much reliance was plnced on the belief that this
courtry would not insist in the last event upon the
payment of this moii'y It was, in his opinion,
a very naturtl inquiry, and was the anxious
inquiry of this countiyand Fiance He said it
was fi that we shou'd answer to it If we aban-
doned the claim there was an end to it If we
did not, the mode and lime of asseitn g our ugh s
was with ourselves Hesaid he had lis ened wi h
much plensuie and interest to his colleag le, [Mr
Archlr ] and had been at a lb«s to determine
what was the conclubton, of which he several
times spolt , that he would come to He sud he
undei tood him at last to come to the conclusion
that the treaty was not obiigatoiy For this he
gives two reasons fust, th \t until the vote of the
Chambets was had, making appropriations for
the payment, the treaty was not final Upon this
point, he would say notl ing His colleague [Mi
Patioy] had answied to that tu ly—peirectly
Indeed, the gemleman's aigument on that poirt,
lfitpioved anything, would piovethat there wis
no obligah-ni on the ¡ait of the Government to
pay any ohVei f i services already tendered, until
this IIo ise snail vote an appropriation Secondly,
mycolleaguethouglu wo had bfen piecipi'a e— oo
hasty      What did he think was hauty      Rather,
what did he think reasonable time to negotiate >
A quarter of a century he thought not long enough.
Would he say how long would be long enough-
would one hundred and twenty-five years be long
enough'   Mr  B said he was willing, if we had
acted hastily, to withdraw—negotiate again     But
before he entered again into  a settlement, he
wished to know how we would do.    It was nota
claim ofthe Government which (hesaid) he wished
might live forever    It was the claim of individ-
uals, most of whom (he said) were dead and gone,
1 and moet of their descendants likewise.    If we
wait much longer, we shall also be dead and gone,
then he supposed there would be an end of the
I matter so far as we are concerned at least     Mr
| B 's colleague said, if we waited longer we cqjjld
have done much better—get much more    Mr  B
said he wished to be serious, and was so, but
j his colleague reminded lura of a case (he would
not give the names) he knew of    An old gentle-
man had a daughter who remained single till she
was foriy five, when she then thought proper to
I marry, and did so     Her father objecting to the
match, said if Peggy had not been in such a hurry
she might have done very well     The gentleman
asks if we really would go to war for five millions
j of dollars'    Many a suit is brought when the cost
' is more than the demand    Will a man fight if you
í spit in his face' Suppose the case of my colleague
—but the case is not supposable—yet if ¡l were
supposable—and should a man spit in the face of
my colleague, would he wash his face and say it
was not worth resenting '   In such a case it would
generally be cheapest  with most if they would
wash it off, and be cleaner than they were before
In almost every case it would be best, but for one
thing—the next neighbor standing by and seeing
we had submitted to that, would do anothei anda
muchgieater indignity to  us when it served his
turn to do so     We were leminoed in the Piench
Chambers that we had taken the like from o her ,
whynotfrom them'   Hesaid that he agieed with
the gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr AdamsJ
that his colleague's argument was  made up of
fear     Did  his colleague read the debates in the
French Chambers, and  did  he not see that the
most talented men in the Opposition then reliai
mainly   that we were  a money-loving,  mmey
getting people, and would  nevei  spend one hun-
dred millions to obtain five'    He knew it was all
a fetch—he asked his colleague's paidon—he knew
there was no feai id him
The Fienchand his colleague, he thought, were
both mistaken He said he heard with pleasuie
and pude for his country and his colleague, when
he spoke of our commerce, covering with unnum
bered millions every sea He asked if we obtained
that commerce, or the proiectten of it, by fear, by
arguments, such as his colleague had ndv need '
We had a name in the world, as a nation, of
which every American was proud We had a
lespect in the eye of all nations, which had not
failed to be acknowledged by them Did we ac-
quire th s by argumen s and piactices bottomed
on consideration of fear' When we weie ac
quiring this, did we snow to the woild that we re-
garded moie our personal secunty thant lit nsrhw

would defend and maintain thf-m both by the
