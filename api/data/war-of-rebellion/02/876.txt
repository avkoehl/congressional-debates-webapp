HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 25, 1861.

Colonel J. B. MAGRUDER,

Commanding, &amp;c., Yorktown, Va.:

COLONEL: Your letter of the 24th instant* has just been received. I understand there is no cavalry at Fort Monroe, no baggage wagons, and but one company of light artillery. I do not think an immediate movement by land may be expected, but I wish you to be prepared for any emergency. According to reports in this office, there must be three companies of cavalry under your command. I will order to you five more. We have no wagons yet for service with troops in the field. It is supposed that you will find no difficulty in procuring wagons and teams in the neighborhood, as many persons in that section of the country engaged in the wood trade, which is now suspended, must have them on hand. You will please see what arrangements you can make for hiring or purchasing the same through your quartermaster, and let him make a report to the chief quartermaster at this place.

I am, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS VIRGINIA FORCES,Richmond, Va., May 25, 1861.

Colonel J. B. MAGRUDER,

Commanding, &c., Yorktown, Va.:

COLONEL: Two 12-pounder brass pieces have been directed to be sent you at Yorktown, which may be applied to the land defenses either below Yorktown or Williamsburg, as you may deem best. Two 8-inch columbians are also sent to you at Yorktown, and, if not wanted for the water defense, they had better be applied to the land, either there or at Williamsburg. I again urge upon you the necessity of the line of defenses between the heads of Queen and College Creeks, about which Colonel Ewell has already received instructions. Colonel Ewell had better be directed to apply all the force he can procure to the erection of those lines. Captains Rives and Meade, of the Engineer Corps, are on duty in the peninsula, and subject to your orders. Should the lines below Williamsburg not have been surveyed and laid out, they had better be put at it directly.

I am, &c.,

R. E. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Commanding Gloucester Point, Va.:

COLONEL: Colonel Talcott will direct Captain Smith, of the Engineer Corps, now at West Point, to take charge of the construction of the battery at Gloucester Point. He will be subject to your orders for the general purposes of defense, but will conform to the instructions of Colonel Talcott as regards the plans and details of the work. You are desired to urge forward the completion of all the batteries, both for the water and land defense, for which purpose it will be desirable for you
