General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Some colored people came in to-night. They lived on the Jerusalem plank road, on the Nottoway. They say they heard that some infantry which was at Stony Creek went away last Sunday toward North Carolina. This was to meet some raiding party of ours. The negroes are being sent south to a considerable extent. Very few pickets are now on plank road, the most of their cavalry force having been withdrawn Monday and Tuesday last.
