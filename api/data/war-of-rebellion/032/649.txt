Here the line gave out west, probably cut again by bushwhackers. Colonel Harrison was ordered back to Fayetteville on the 12th, and ought to be at Bentonville to-night.

GREENFIELD, MO., October 18, 1863.

GENERAL: On leaving Buffalo I proceeded to Bolivar, and then to Ricker's Mills, where I learned that the enemy had passed through Humansville on the 16th instant. I then made a night march to Stockton, where I arrived in the morning, and learned that the enemy had passed 10 miles east of that place at 1 o'clock this morning. I left Stockton this a. m., and arrived here at 4 p. m. I shall leave in the morning in pursuit of the rebels, estimated at from 500 to 1,000. Major King had a running fight with them as far as Humansville, and captured one piece of artillery and 40 rounds of ammunition. The rebels crossed the Sauk at Subert's Mill, and are pursuing the course of the Linn Creek, with the intention of going out by Mount Vernon.

SARCOXIE, MO., October 18, 1863-5 p. m.

GENERAL: I have just arrived at this place, and received a dispatch from General Holland, now at Mount Vernon, informing me that major Hart, commanding scouts in direction of Marionville, came up and fired on a force of the enemy, camped at John Dunkle's, on Rock Prairie, about 12 miles from Greenfield. Major Hart estimates the force at 1,500 and more. General holland says he has reliable information that Shelby and Coffee passed Lamar yesterday at 1 o'clock, traveling in the direction of Carthage and Neosho, with a force estimated at 600. With the force that General Holland has, he can defeat the enemy, if he meets them. I think the number of the enemy greatly exaggerated: Major King has joined me. I shall leave in pursuit in the morning, in the direction of Neosho.

CASSVILLE, MO., October 19, 1863-7 p. m.

GENERAL: Just came in from Gadfly. My column is moving to Keytesville. Shelby crossed the Wire road at Cross Timbers at 2 this p. m. Hunter and Coffee crossed the Springfield road, 21 miles above here, yesterday. Brooks has moved to Huntsville, and I suppose these three bands will concentrate at that place. I shall take all the available force I can march, and try to anticipate their concentration. Edwards will be here to-morrow evening. I will order him after me with his force. I can beat them combined, or drive them toward the Arkansas River, and upon any force you may order out of Little Rock or Fort
