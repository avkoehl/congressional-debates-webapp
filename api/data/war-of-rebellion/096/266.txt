HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., January 25, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

A party of rebel soldiers and citizens did rob a store at Shepherdstown of a small amount of goods. I saw the party robbed, who promised to furnish me the names of the parties engaged. I did not understand that there were other stores robbed, as he made no report of that fact. I have not received any report from General Seward in regard to the matter. My information is that the robbery was committed by some rebel soldiers and citizens, and not by a party organized for a raid. There are but two or three stores, and with small stocks.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,January 25, 1865.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

If you find any citizens harboring or abetting these robber bands in your district drive off all their stock and burn all their grain. Turn the stock over to the agent of the Treasury Department. There are certainly some such people about Shepherdstown and its vicinity.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General CROOK,

Commanding Department of West Virginia, Cumberland, Md.:

Two of my scouts have just returned from Staunton. They think that Rosser meditates a raid westward to Weston or Clarksburg as soon as the weather moderates. Keep a sharp lookout for him at Bull's Gap and Buckhannon.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Has General Tower been ordered to report to General Ord? If he has not been I will have General Shepley relieved with some officer now here.

Lieutenant-General.
