MONTGOMERY, April 9, 1861.

General BRAGG,

Pensacola:

Captain Braggs left here this morning to join you. Forty thousand dollars are at you disposal, to be used in the way he suggested to me as coming from you. Although he has no instructions on that point, as it escaped me in the hurry of his departure, you will, however, understand.

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., April 9, 1861.

General BRAGG,

Pensacola:

A post-office emissary of the Washington Government, named Bryan, has left or will leave for Pensacola, who contumaciously insists upon opening the route between Warrington and Pensacola. Deal with him as you may think he deserves.

L. P. WALKER.

MONTGOMERY, April 9, 1861.

General BRAGG,

Pensacola:

Forty thousand sand bags have been shipped from New York. May be intended for cover-faces at Fort Pickens. I call your attention to this possibility.

L. P. WALKER.

PENSACOLA, April 9, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

Your several dispatches of to-day just received. Will handle the post-office emissary. Shall try the use of money; but great vigilance is exercised. They fear their own men. Shall take up buoys and stop lights very soon.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

MONTGOMERY, April 12, 1861.

General BRAGG,

Pensacola:

Lieutenant Worden, of U. S. Navy, has gone to Pensacola with dispatches. Intercept them.

L. P. WALKER.

BARRANCAS, April 12, 1861.

Honorable L. P. WALKER:

Mr. Worden had communicated with fleet before your dispatch received. Alarm guns have just fired at Fort Pickens. I fear the news is received and it will be re-enforced before morning. It cannot be prevented. Mr. Worden got off in cars before I knew of his landing. Major Chambers is in the cars. He will watch Mr. Worden's movements. If you deem it advisable, Mr. Worden can be stopped in Montgomery.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

Brigadier-General.
