Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAVANNAH, March 22, 1865.

His Excellency EDWIN STANTON,

Secretary of War:

HONORABLE SIR: I feel it my duty, as the head of the Catholic Church in Savannah, to inform you of the proceedings ordered by the military authorities against the Catholic cemetery of this city, to give expression to what I deem a legitimate complaint, and to enter a solemn protest in the name of the Catholic community.

Fortifications are now being erected upon the Catholic cemetery. A few days ago I received a communication, written by order of General Gillmore, informing me that he (the general) would make a personal inspection of the locality, and wished me to accompany him to the cemetery. On hearing of the arrival of the general in Savannah I did all I could to find him out, but in vain; and the day after his visit I learned, altogether accidentally, that 300 men were to be the next day on the graveyard to proceed to the work of disinterring the dead and erecting fortifications on their tombs. I thus had no chance to apply to Your Excellency at least for a suspension of the work.
