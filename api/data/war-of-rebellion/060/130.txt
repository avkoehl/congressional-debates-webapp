Colonel S. A. Moore. And now the command is safely in their old camp, in a better condition as to health than before those two days of exposure in deep streams, inclement weather, and the close engagement of a formidable enemy.

To distinguish between the conduct of the different officers and men of the command, where all were at their posts, is difficult. The Fourteenth Connecticut, One hundred and eighth New York, and Tenth Battalion deserve great credit for the heavy fighting they did, driving a superior force of the enemy and frequently using the bayonet. Lieutenant Colonel T. H. Davis, Lieutenant Colonel F. E. Pierce, Lieutenant Colonel S. A. Moore, Captain Dewey, and Captain Tait, commanding, respectively, the Twelfth New Jersey, One hundred and eighth New York, Fourteenth Connecticut Volunteers, Tenth New York Battalion, and First Delaware Battalion, did their whole duty. Captain W. H. Andrews, acting assistant adjutant-general; Captain W. H. Hawley, acting assistant inspector-general, and Lieutenants Porter and Du Bois, aides-de-camp, on my staff, I desire to mention as having made themselves distinguished by their bearing and coolness before the enemy.
