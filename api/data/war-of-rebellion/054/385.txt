On the second day Major Sherwood, commanding the One hundred and eleventh Ohio, proved himself a good soldier and a competent officer, and on the third day all did well, especially Major Wheeler, commanding the Twenty-third Michigan, who held his men firm to their work for over two hours, under a most galling fire from the enemy's infantry.

I could fill up much space by recounting exploits of both officers of the line and men, and also in speaking of the conduct of my staff. They all deserve notice, but time and room will not admit. However, I must not forget to mention the gallant conduct of Brigadier-General White, who, after giving the final orders for retirement of the troops, remained with me and personally aided in their execution, and at all times he showed a disposition to be where his presence was most needed and share the fate of the brigade, be that what it might.

Honorable notice should also be taken of the officers and men of Henshaw's (Illinois) battery and the Twenty-fourth Indiana Battery, who stood by their guns, working them well until ordered off.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to submit the following report of my regiment in the three engagements, at Huff's Ferry, opposite Loudon, and Campbell's Station, on the 14th, 15th, and 16th instant:

In pursuance of orders from Colonel Chapin, commanding Second Brigade, received on the evening of the 13th November, I was ordered to have my command in readiness to move the next morning at 4 o'clock. The regiments all being on picket duty that night, it was near daylight before they were relieved and returned to camp.
