ROCK ISLAND S0LDIB113' MONOMENT. j
Mr.WITCHER, from the Committee on Mjli- j
tary Affairs, reported back,with a recommenda- j
lion that the same do pass, House bill No. 195,
to authorize the Secretary of War to place at j
the disposal of the soldiers' monument com-
mittee of Rock Island county, Illinqis, certain
condemned ordnance.
The question was on ordering the bill to be
engrossed and read a third time.
The bill, which was read, directs the Secre.
tary of War to place at the disposal of the sol-
diers' monument committee, at Rock Island,
Illinois, twelve pieces of condemned ordnance
from the arsenal at Rock Island, for the pur-
pose of completingthesoldiers' monument and
appurtenances at Rock Island.
Mr. MAYNARD. " We have already passed ,
a bill to appropriate fifty pieces of rebel ord-
nance for a similar purpose. This proposition |
is to appropriate twelve pieces of condemned {
ordnance at Rock Island arsenal. Does it
contemplate that twelve pieces shall hereafter
be condemned for thisjmrpose, or is there now
some condemned ordnance there which it is pro â€¢
posed to take? We have disposed of a great
deal of our old material since the war, and we
should see to it that we do not go beyond the
amount we have, otherwise we will "have to
condemn some good ordnance for that pur-
pose.
Mr. HAWLEY. I will say to the gentleman
from Tennessee [Mr. Maynard] that there is
considerable condemned ordnance now at Rock
Island arsenal.
Mr. MAYNARD. How much?
Mr. HAWLEY. I suppose there are a hun-
dred pieces condemned, and probably six
hundred pieces in all thereof cannon captured
from the rebels during the war. There has
been a monument erected at Rock Island by
citizens at a cost from eight to ten thousand
dollars. All that is proposed by this bill is to
take some twelve peices of this condemned rebel
cannon for parts of a fence to be erected around
that monument.
_ Mr. MAYNARD. I think it may be a good
piece of economy to pass this bill, for we shall
probably never get anything for this ordnance
and will have to pay considerable to keep it
bright and scoured up.
Mr. WITCHER. I now call the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered; and under the opera-
tion thereof the bill was ordered to be engrossed
and read a third time; and being engrossed,
it was read the third time, and passed.
Mr. WITCHER moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
