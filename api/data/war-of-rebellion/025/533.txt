McPHERSON'S, January 4, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

My command will march to the vicinity of Holly Springs to-morrow. Shall I destroy the railroad bridge over the Tallahatchie? I understand that I cannot leave a force of infantry here, but have Colonel Leggett's brigade march back as far as Lumpkin's Mill at least, and then follow on after everything there and at Waterford has been removed.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., January 4, 1863.

Major General J. B. McPHERSON, Abbeville, Miss.:

I think it is not necessary to destroy the Tallahatchie Bridge. The road is destroyed so far south that the enemy cannot use it for some time, and we may want it; at least we will keep up the appearance of wanting it. Move your whole force back, however, leaving one brigade at Lumpkin's Mill.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

McPHERSON'S, January 4, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

The battalion of cavalry sent out day before yesterday to Rocky Ford has not returned. They were instructed to push on until they met the enemy or learned something of his movements, and as they have not returned or sent any word back I think they have gone beyond Rocky Ford.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

McPHERSON'S, January 4, 1863.

Major-General GRANT:

Scout just returned from Pontotoc. Only a few cavalry there; he could not learn anything of Van Dorn's movements that was definite, though reports said he had gone east toward the Moble and Ohio Railroad, and was collecting all the cavalry, Partisan Rangers, &amp;c., that he could.

The battalion of cavalry has just returned from Rocky Ford; found no enemy except few straggling guerrillas on this side of the Tallahatchie, and only heard of a small force being on the other side.

Lieutenant Gile has not returned yet with flag of truce.

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.

McPHERSON'S, January 4, 1863.

General GRANT:

I have sent to Colonel Grierson at Waterford to move with two battalions of cavalry immediately toward Tallaloosa.
