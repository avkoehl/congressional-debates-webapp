General HUMPHREYS:

I will complete to-night the change from first to the second line on my left, holding the first line with pickets or skirmishers. Each division has one-third in reserve, relieving the trenches with them. The reserves are in rear of each division. I have eighteen light guns in reserve to move to any point. I can see no reason, on investigation of the reports, to apprehend and attack to-night.
