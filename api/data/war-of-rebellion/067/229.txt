The number of wounded sent in this train, as reported by the corps medical directors, was as follows:

Corps.	 Wounded.	 Wagons.

Second	 125	 32

Fifth	 1,419	 196

Sixth	 150	 35

Total	 1,694	 263

To the above number reported should be added about 600 slightly wounded who moved with the train. Most of them from the day's engagement, and not going to the field hospitals nor being accounted for by the corps medical directors, which would make the total number sent to be 2,294. The wagons were bedded with straw and small evergreen boughs covered with blankets and shelter-tents, and carried from 3 to 5 men each, hard-bread boxes being used as seats for those who were able to sit up. Four thousand rations were sent with the train, and medical officers and attendants in the same proportion as in the first train from the Wilderness. No escort was sent, as the movements of the Cavalry Corps on the left were thought to afford sufficient protection. This train reached Fredericksburg at 11 p. m. of May 10 without trouble, having halted once on the road to furnish soup and coffee to the wounded. Two general assaults were made on the enemy's line during the day, the principal one about 4 p. m. The corps hospitals remained as established on the 9th, the advance depots being along the banks of the Po River. The character of the country was essentially that of the Wilderness, but lower and more marshy. Small open spaces existed at intervals in which artillery could be used, but the greater part of the engagement occurred in the woods, in which the dense undergrowth of hazel and shrub oak precluded the use of every arm but the musket. By 9 p. m., there had been collected and brought into the field hospitals the following number of wounded:

Second Corps............................................... 800

Fifth Corps................................................ 300

Sixth Corps................................................ 200

Total......................................................1,300

Number of wounded straggling (estimated)................... 600

Total number of wounded, May 10............................1,900

A number of the wounded of the Second Corps fell into the hands of the enemy when the corps withdrew in the evening to the north bank of the Po; the number so lost is estimated to have been 300. The train of the medical purveyor was at this time at Silver's, 4 miles only from the hospitals, and large issues were made during the day, especially for the purpose of refilling the ambulance boxes which had been emptied at Fredericksburg.

All the hospitals were supplied with ice, lemons, canned peaches, jellies, hospital clothing, &amp; c., in addition to the hospital stores usually furnished under such circumstances. The duties of the medical officers attached to the field hospitals during the day were extremely arduous, and their satisfactory performance merits the highest praise. Many of the medical officers were absent, having been sent off with the first train of wounded, or detailed to remain
