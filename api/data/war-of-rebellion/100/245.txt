General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I received your dispatch+ describing the man Clark detailed to assassinate me. He had better be in a furry or he will be too late. The news of Mr. Lincoln's death produced a most intense effect on our troops. At first I feard it would lead to excesses, but now it had softened down and can easily by guided. None evinced more feeling than General Johnston, who admitted that the act was calculated to stain his cause with a dark hue, and he contended that the loss was most serious to the people of the South, who had begun to realize that Mr. Lincoln was the best friend the South had. I cannot believe that even Mr. Davis was privy to the diabolical plot, but think it the emanation of a set of young men of the South who are very devils. I want to throw upon the South the care of this class of men, who will soon be as obnoxious to their industrial classes as to us. Had I pushed Johnston's army to an extremity these would have dispersed and would have done infinite mischief. Johnston informed me that Stoneman had been at Salisbury and was now about Statesville. I have sent him orders to come to me. General Johnston also informed me that Wilson was at Columbus, Ga., and he wanted me to arrest his progress. I leave that to you. Indeed, if the President sanctions my agreement with Johnston, our interest is to cease all destruction. Please give all orders necessary according to the views the Executive may take, and influence him, of possible, not to very the terms at all, for I have considered everything and believe that the Confederate armies once dispersed we can adjust all else failry and well.

I am, yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Raleigh, N. C., April 18, 1865.

Commanding GENERAL ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES IN VIRGINIA:

GENERAL: I have agreed with Generak Joseph E. Johnston for a temproary cessation of active hostilities, to enable me to lay before our Government at Washington the agreement made between us, with the full sanction of Mr. Davis and in the presence of Mr. Breckinridge, of the disandment of all the armies of the Confederacy from here to the Rio Grnde. If any of your forces are moving toward Johnston I beg you to check them where they are or at the extremity of any railroad where they may be supplied until you receive orders from general Grant, or until I notify you that the agreement is at an end and hostilities resumed.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
