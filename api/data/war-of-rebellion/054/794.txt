Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Eleventh Army Corps:

GENERAL: Yours of this [morning] has been received. With regard to your troops forming in junction with mine, I verbally mentioned to General Hooker 8 o'clock as the time. Upon consulting my records, I find in my written communications to the general that I reported one brigade as having reported at half past 5 o'clock and the other at 7 o'clock. My verbal statement was a mistake.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
