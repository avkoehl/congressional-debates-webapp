be a great injury to íeceive them, for they will be
taken out of circulation, and returned in masses on
the banks fci redemption They cannot be paid
out by the Government, and, therefore, will have
to be presented for redemption to the banks The
act of 183G cuts them off from all payments from
the Pedeial Government, or the post offices That
act contains three limitations upon the payment of
these notes first, no note under twenty dollars is
to be paid out, and that cuts off the greater num-
ber secondly, no note is to be paid out which is
issued at one place, and made payable at another,
llmdly, no note of any km-1 is to be paid out, un-
less it is equal to gold and silver at the place where
offered, and conyei tibie into specie upon the spot, at
the will of the holdei, and without loss or delay to
him This is. the strongest limitation, and cuts off
all payments in notes unless where the bank itself
is situated The three limitations taken together,
and they are all m full force, cut off bank paper
from nearly every payment to b° made, either by
the United States oi by the Post Office Department.
I do not pretend to exhaust this subject, I only
touch the leading objections to the further use of
bank notes by the Government, and the future use
of banks as depos tones of public money •. It is
a practice fraught with mischiet to both parties, and
has been so pioved by repeated experience To
receive the notes of banks for revenue, if they are
to be paid in good faith, is merely to take them out
oí circulation, and to return them m masses for
redemption, to the great peril and alarm of the
bank, if thev are not to be paid, their receipt is a
fraud upon the Got ernment So said Mr Craw-
ford when he was Secretary of the Treasury, and
when members of Congiess, marching in column
upon him, backed by legislative petitions, w ere
demanding this privilege for so many It cal b inks
Importunity and legislative interfeience most usual-
ly prevailed, and in almost every instance to tie
injury of the bank, and to the loss of the Govern-
ment So will it be again, if the practice is íe-
sumed
Again It is tempting the banl s into ruinous ex-
pansions thus to give them the credit and the domain
of the United States to bank upon They put out
floods of notes, because reeeivability at the custom
house, the land office, and the post office, gives
them ciedit and circulation After some months,
pay-day comes Eederal credit, which got the
notes into circulation, will not pay them the bank
stops, depreciation ensues the less falls upon the
Government, and upon the unm'oimed holders ot
the notes
Again It is a false ciedit given by the Govern-
ment to the whole issues of any bank Whose paper
is so received It is indorsement without lesponsi-
bihty People take it, because the Government
takes it, and when the bank tails, the Government
does not indemmfy those who have been deceived
by an indorsement, valid toi deception, and invalid
for responsibility
Again This Government reeeivability enables
notes to stray fiom their know n oibtt of circulation,
to go offinto distant parts, wl tie they are unknown,
to lne theie a while m the sun-shine of federal
favor, to circulate atvh 1c on land office and custom
house ciedit, and finalh , to sink as insolvents upon
the hands of stratus
A<*am Tneie must be selection of banks, or
unive sality of íeception If selection, then favor-
itism, patronage, caprice—refusal to-day, reception
to-moirow—..mposi'ion on some, undue advantage
to others—come into plat If reeeivability is um-
yeisal, then a thousind banks now in existence,
ami thousands more to be created all become fur-
nishers of federal cunencv , and in a few yeais
the public lands a e changed into papei—the cus-
tom house revenue becomes a bale of paper—anu
this paper woith as little as it would be if it was
decomposed, and restoied to its original state of
lampblack and rags
Again To take the promissory not"S of the
banks for lands, customs, and postages, is to ex-
tend a credit to the banks which is denied to the
community The firmer is íequired to pay ready
money for the public lands, but if the note of the
bank is received, this is a credit to the bank—a
credit to a barren moneyed eoiporauon, winch is
denied to a ptoductive, meiitouous citizen The
same of postages, and the same is, in some degiee,
the case at the custom-houses now, and will be
fully, when ready money payments are required
there as another bill before the Senate now pro-
poses
Agí n To make the banks depositories of our
morejs, involves the use, or the prohibition of the
use, of these moneys. If the former, then the re-
venues are as much jeoparded as ever, if the lat-
ter, then the bank has no benefit from tne deposite
Again To continue these banks as depositories,
is to create an mteiest—a powerful, active, con-
centrated interest, in Congress and out of Congress
—in favor of high taxes, and low appropriations
The late Bank of the Un ted States was such an
interest during the whole time of its existence It
was the ally o( high tariffs, and the enemy of ap-
propriation bills Its principle of action was—.
take from the people, and leave with us' and so it wjll
be with a league of local depository banks Their
presidents, and directors, their stockholders and at-
torneys, with all their friends and debtors will be a
unit, to keep up taxes, and to keep down appropria-
tions The Government should not create, for it-
self and for the people, so formidable an antagonist
The friends of the banks treat it as their ruin, as
a grievous outrage and indignity, for the Govern-
ment of the United States to refuse to take their
notes, and to refuse to use them as depositories, }et
this was their condition during the whole time of the
existence of the Bank of the United States, and yet
they made no objection to it then This is strange'
but what is more so is, that while thus stiuggling
against the Government, the) are, many of tham,
m lavor of re-establishing a national bank, the first
act of which will be to strip them of Government
deposites, and exclude then paper liom Govern
ment receivalilitv'
Congress has a sacred duty to perform in reform-
ing the finances, and the currency, for the rum of
both has resulted from federal legislation, and fede-
ral administration The States, at the formation
of the Constitution, delivered a solid currency—
I will not say soun I for that word implies sub-
ject to unsoundness, to rottenness, and to death
—but they delivered a solid cmiency, one not
liable to disease, to this ledcral Government
Thej staited the new Government fair upon gold
and silver^ The fust act of Congicss attested this
"reat fact, fot t made the revenues payable in gold
ant silver com on y Thus t>ac States dehverela
solid cinencj to this Government, and the) re-
served the same currency for themselves, and they
provided constitutional sanctions to guard both
The thing to be saved, and the power to save it, was
given to this Government bv the States, and m the
hands ofthis'Goveinment it became deteriorated The
first great errorwas Ge"i Hamilton's construct on of
the act of 1789, by which he nullified that act, and
overturned the statute and he Constitution together
The next gieat eiror was the establish nent ot a
national bank of cncnlation, with authonty to pay
all the public dues m its own paper This con-
firmed the overtbiovv of the Constitution, and of the
watutc of 1789, and it «at the fatal example for the
States to make banks, and to receive their piper
foi public dues, as the United States had done
This was Ihe ongin of the evil—this the origin of
the overthrow of the solid curre ncy w Inch the States
1 ad delivered to the Federal Government It was
the H imiltoman policy that did the mischief, and
the state of things m 1837, is the natural fiuit of
that pohey It is lime for us to quit it—to return
to the Constitution, and the s'atute of 1789, and to
confine the Federal Treasury to the hard money
w hich was intended foi it
I íepeat, this is a measure of reform, worthy to
be called a reformation It goes back to a tunda-
mental abuse,nearly coeval with the foundation of
the Government Two epochs have occuned for
the reformation of this abuse, ene w as lost, the other
is now in jeopardy Mr Madison's admimstia-
tion committed a great error at the expnation of
the charter of the first Bank of the United States,
in not reviving the currency of the Constitution
foi theFedeial Treasury, and especially the GOLD
curency Tnat eiror threw the Tieasuiy back
upon The local V nk  papei     This papei  quid 1}
failed, and out of that failure grew t e second
United States Bank Those who put down this
second United States Bank, warned by the calami-
ty, determined to avoid the error of Mr. Madison's
administration they determined to increase the
¡>tock of specie, and to revive the GOLD circula-
tion, which had been dead for thirty years. The
accumulation of EIGHTY millions in the brief
space of five years, FIFTEEN millions of it in
GOLD, attest the sincerity of their design, and the
facility of its execution The country was going
on at the rare of an average increase of TWELVE
millions of specie per annum, when the general stop-
pages of the banks m May last.the exportation of spe-
cie,and the imposition ofirreeleemablepaper upon the
Government and the people, seemed to announce
the total failure of the plan But it was a seeming
only The íripeUis giren to the specie policy still
prevails, and FIVE millions ar« added to the stock
daring the present fiscal year So far, then, as the
counteraction of the Government policy, an 1 the
suppressioa of the -constitutional currency, might
hare been expected to result from that stoppage,
the calculation seem* to be in a fair way to be dis-
appointed The spirit of the peep'e, and our
HUNDRED millions of exportable produce, are
giving the victory to the glorious policy of our late
lllu.trtom  President The other great consequences
expected to result from that stoppage, namely, the
rechartet of the Bank of the United States, the
coange of adnnniotration, the overthrow of the
republican party, and the restoration ot the federal
dynasty, all s em to be in the *ame fair way to
total miscarriage, but the objects are too dazzling
to be abandoned by the partv interested, and the de-
struction of the finances and the cuirency, is still the
cherished roa 111 success The m scalled Bank of
the United S'ates, ¡he soul of the federal elynasty,
an 1 the anchor of its hopes,—bel eved by many to
rate been at the bottom of the stoppages in May,
and known by all to be at the head of mm resump-
'ion,—now displays her policy on this floor it is to
compel the repetition of the error oí Mr Madron's
administiation' Knowing that from the repetition
of th s error must come the repetition of the catas-
trophes of 1814—1819—-and 1837, and out of ihe*
catasltophcs to extract a new clamor for the íe-
vification of herself This is her line of conduct,
and to this line, the conduct of all her friends con-
forms With one heart, one mind, oh< vo ce, they
labor to cutoff gol 1 and silver frem tne Fedeial
Government, and to inapos« paper upon it' they
labor to elepnve it of the keeping of its own reve-
nues, ard to pla«E them again vvheie they have
been so often lost' This is the conduct of that
bank and its fnends Let us imitate their zeal,
their unammitv, and their perseverance The
AMENDMENT, and the BILL, now before the
Senate, emboehes our ,ohcy Let us cany them,
and the Republic is eafe.
SPEECH OF MR. HUBBARD,
Of Nkw Hampshire.
In Señale, Septemher £8, 1837—On the bill impos-
ing additional duties on certain o3icers as depo-
sito íes, i  certain cases.
Mr HUBBiRD addressed the Senate as fol-
lows
Mr President Hating voted for the act "to
tegulate the deporte* of the pubnc money," hav-
ing also voted at the last sess-on for the bill intro-
duced by the Senator from Virginia, " designating
and limiting the funds receivable for the levenues
of th  United States ," and having, at the present
session, as a member of the Committee of Fi-
nance, agreed to report the bill now under conside-
ration—a bill essentially conflicting with the two
bills íeferrel to, I have felt it to be a mat'er ot
duty to myself, as well as to those whom I repre
* sent, to explain the grounds of my action, and, also,
the views which I entert&m with reference to the
meaiuie now proposed as a. substitute for the depo-
site act of June, 1836 And I will now proceed to
submit what I have to offer, if it be the pleasure
of the Senate that I should proceed I can not be
insensible, however, that in rising to address tho
Senate at this t>me, after their attention has been
