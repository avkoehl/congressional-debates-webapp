HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,Plank Road, April 8, 1865-7.45 a. m.

General WEBB:

After moving southward one mile and a half on the road to Farmville and then taking the road west for a mile, we came on the plank road leading to Buckingham Court-House, which runs northwesterly. A dirt road runs parallel with the plank road on the west of it. The westerly road, I am told, turns northwest at a distance of two or three miles from here. The enemy's trains and some infantry moved on the westerly road. The main body of infantry apparently took he dirt road parallel with the plank road; the cavalry apparently took the plank road. I am moving along the dirt road that runs parallel with the plank road. I have prisoners from Gordon's, Longstreet's, and Hill's corps. Evidently the whole of Lee's army was encamped here last night.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The road upon which I started becomes exceedingly bad, and the best way to get into the main stage road, which leads to Lynchburg, and upon which I am now, is to move out on the plank road until it intersects this road, which is from Cumberland Court-House to Lynchburg.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,April 8, 1865.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

A short time ago a flag of truce approached our skirmishers, and upon sending out to meet it we met an officer of General Fitzhugh Lee's staff who asked on behalf of General F. Lee the contents of communication of this morning and whether the communication of this morning was intended to interrupt the operations of the day. He was informed that the communication was sealed, contents not known; that it was not intended to interrupt the operations of to-day, and that the officer of their receiving the communication was so informed. I send this chiefly to let you know that Fitzhugh Lee's cavalry is in this vicinity and he may be attacking the rear. I have ordered a strong regiment to be sent as guard to the supply train, which I understand is close up to my rear.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
