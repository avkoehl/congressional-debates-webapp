GLADE SPRING, May 7, 1864.

Major STRINGFELLOW,

Dublin:

General Jackson goes by railroad to-day with 400 infantry to New River bridge. Saltville is sufficiently garrisoned. Cavalry will be ready to succor either point. Sufficient force should be at lead mines to keep of cavalry. Instruct it to hold houses, and fight to the last, as succor will soon come. Answer. Scouts report Averell on the 4th on Dry Fork with ten regiments of cavalry.

W. E. JONES,

Brigadier-General.

WOODSTOCK, May 8, 1864-7.30 a. m.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Enemy still very close in Winchester. I can force evacuation of place by moving into Hampshire, and attacking Baltimore and Ohio Railroad. Have delayed my movements one day to confer with you. If you come here with force you mentioned, we can clear this border in five days, destroy railroad, canal, and coal mines from New Creek to martinsburg. If you come had I better await your arrival or go at once to Hampshire? As soon as I reach Hampshire, Sigel will quit Winchester, and fall back on railroad.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

WOODSTOCK, May 8, 1864.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Dispatch* received. Reports from the front received since my dispatch of this morning represent enemy's cavalry to have been considerably re-enforced, and indication of a movement of the whole force to the eastward in a day or two. I have detachments now reconnoitering who will report to-night. Staunton will not be endangered by my proposed movement. Information to be received to-night will determine my course in exercise of the discretion allowed me.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.
