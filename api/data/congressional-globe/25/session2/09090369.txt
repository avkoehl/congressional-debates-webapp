sary details; in consideration of which, Georgia le-
gislated specifically to protect the Cnerokee occu-
pants in their possessions until November, 1836,
several months beyond the session of Congress
within which Ross pledged h n.3e'f to close a final
adjustment still reserving the ¡)Ov.cr of further ex-
tension, and tu 1S36 actually extending the right of
Cherokee occupancy up to n^ 25th of Mav, 1838
In the course oí that session of Congress in which
Ross held out to Georgia the premise of a final ar-
rangement, the treaty of wInch we have heard so
much was ratified, and in conformity to its provi-
sions, allowing to the Cherokees two years to com-
plete their removal from the 23d of May, 1836, in
November theieafter, the Legislature of Georgia
extended the protection of the State to the Cherokee
occupants up to the 25th of May, 1838 Sir, the
u hole cours  of the legislation of Georgia upon
this subject, from the time the communication from
Ross was laid before the Legislature, was based
npon the faith of that document.
[At this stage Mr. H.4YNES yielded to the entrea-
ties of a number of gentlemen, and gave way to
Mr. Underwood of Kentucky, on whose motion
the committee rose. On the following day the
House went again into committee on the same bill,
and Mr. Haynes concluded his remarks as fol-
lows.—Reporter.}
Mr. Chairman, when I addressed the House yes-
terday, I had, as I thought, closed, or nearly closed,
the remaiks I proposed to make as to the right of
Georgia to jurisdiction over the Indians within her
limi's, together with her legislation upon the sub-
ject. As I stated to the committee at the com-
mencement of mv remarks, it was a subject of sin-
cere regret to find myself under the necessity of
once more taking part in the discussion of this In-
dian subject. But I will now recur, for a moment,
as connected with the histor} of this subject, to a
document written, or purporting to have been writ-
ten, by a distinguished citizen cf Kentucky, now
one of her Senators in the Congress of the United
States, [Mr. Clay ]
Ashland, June 6,1831
Deas Sir I received your lettei of the 14th ultimo, descnb
mg the wrongs and sufferings of the Cherokee nation Of these
I have been previously well informed In common with a
large portion ot the citizens ot the United States, I regretted
them, and felt the sincerest sympathy with you on account of
them, I resetted them not only becaus of then injustice but
because they inflicted a deep wound on the civaiactei of the
American Republic
I have supoosed that the pnnc pies which had uni'brmly
governed our relations with the Cherokee and other Indian na
tions, had been too long and too firmly established to be dis
tuibed at this day They were pioctatmed in the negotiat on
niih Great Britain, at Ghent, by the American commissioners
who conclude I the treaty of peace, and having been one of
those commissioners,, I leel with more «ensibilny than nioGt of
my fellow citizens, any violation ef lho=e principles For, if
we stated them incorrectly, we deceive' Great Batain and if
our Government acts in opposition to them, wt deceive the
world
According to thos.  principle  the Cherokee nation has the
right to establish its own fmm ol Government, and to alter and
amend ltfiom lime to time, according to its own sense of its
own wants to live under its own laws to be exempt from the
operations of the law  ot the United States, and quietly to pos
sess and enioy its lands, subject to no other limitation than
that, when sold they can only be ¡,old to the Xjmted States I
considei the piesent \dininistration o<"the Government of the
United States as having announced a system of pehev m uirect
hostility withthose principles, and thereby encouraged Geor
gia to usuip powers of legislation over the Cherokee nation,
which she does not of right possess
Such ate my opinions which aie expressed at your reque«t
Buttheyare the opinions of a pnvate individual, which ca¡
avail you nothing
Whatought the Cherokee'to do in their present critical si
tuition'is a most important question for their consideration
Without being able to advise them, I see very clearly what they
ought nn to do They ousrht not to make war They ought to
bear everv oppression rathei than fly to aims The people of
the United ¡states tie alone competent now toiediess these
wron"*, anditls tobe hoped that they willsoonei or later applv
the competent remedj
In comn unicafng these opinions at yeur instance, I have
done it wi h no intention that they should be published A
publication might d-i mjuiy, and I therefore request fiat it be
not made                             ,   „
I feel verv thankful for the friendly sentiments towards my
self, which you have expressed and offer my sincere wishes
that your nation finally may obtain justice at the hands of the
United States, and may become a civilized, christian, and pros
perous community
I am, with high íespect,
Youi obedient sew ant,
Mr John Günter                                                   h rI A^
There is no membei of this committee who is
less inclined to engage in paitisan conflict than I
am; but as a part ol the history of the influences
brought to bear upon the controversy then pending
between Georgia and the Cheiokees, I should have
24
felt conscious of doing injustice to the people «ho
have confided to me a high irust, -f I had not placed
that communication in such connection with this
subject as to have brought it to their notice I
w ill advert once more, foe a moment, 'o the con-
troversy between the authorities of Georgia and
the missionaries Worcester and Butler, for the pur-
dose of stating, that all which Georgia required of
them, or any other individuals residing within that
portion of her territory occupied by the Chero-
kees, wa' the acknowledgment of, and subm s-
sion to, the jurisdiction of the State.
I might not have thought it necessary to spend a
word upon this subject, if it were not for the im-
pressions made in various parts of this country as
respects the true motives which actuated Georgia
in thsse transactions, and if she had not been re-
presented as designedly trampling upon the dispen-
sation of religious and christian principle. When
those missionanes entered the Cherokee country,
it was by permission of the Government of the
United States, and the law of Georgia under which
they were tried and convicted, contained ample
provision for the protection of every individual set-
tled there as an agent, &c. by the permission of
lhat Government, and they must have been ex-
ceedingly ambitious of martyrdom, or something
else, wantonly to have exposed themselves to the
criminal jansdition of the State
In the remarks made by the gentleman from
Virginia, [Mr. Wise] upon the conduct of Geor-
gia "towards the Cherokees and othei Indian tribes
within ht-r borders, he -was pleased to arraign her
motives f r dtsposm" of, or distributing her own
knds, and not only designated them as mercenary,
but spoke of her plan of distribution as a gambling
lottery System, if i rightly undei stood his expres-
sions
In odcpüng that metho', she adopted no new
principle in refeience to hei public and unlocaied
lands. From the earliest period of the history of
Georgia, so far as I have been informed, and cer-
tainly ever since the passage of her law for open-
ing a land office on the 7th of June, 1777, the pub-
lic lands of the State of Georgia have been consid-
ered the propel ty of her citizens, and distributed
among them. This, sir, is an old system of gam-
bling, and sanctioned by some of the wisest and
best men of this country, which has existed m one
form or another, certainty for sixty years, and pro-
bably in substance for more than a centuiy I re-
marked yesterday, that m the jurisdiction claimed
for the Fedeial Goverment over Indians, there wa 
but a single grant of power to it in the Federa'
Constitution on that subject, and that that cr^nt
was contained in the brief clause conferni,  me
commercial poiver upon this Government, and it as
alike applicable to the regulation of commerce
with foreign nations among the several States,
and with the Indian tribes I said it was
the absurdest of all inferences to attempt to
deduce exclusive jurisdiction over Indians from
that c'ause oí the Federal Constitution. For
that in to doing, «e should annihilate the
reserved rights and jurisdiction of the States in
eveiy thing else. The slighest attention to the
general tone of discuss.on on the part of those who
contend for the exclusive jurisdiction ot the United
States over the Indians, must satisfy every unpreju-
diced mind, that it is made to rest upon the extrava-
gant an erroneous impression tnat, from first to last,
The United Suites, as one consolidated nat.on, pos-
sessed original, inherent sovereignty over tus
whole subject But, as I said v es erd i /. the entn e
sovereignty over the soil and population cf the
severaf colonies planted on this continent, from
the hour that toe banner of Feidituuid and Isa-
bella was unfurled upon its shore* bv Columbus,
was claimed by the colonizing nations of Euiope,
and that such sovereignty, as to us, passed, per-
fect and unimpaired, to the possession ot the seve-
ral States at the establishment of American Inde-
pendence. This being the case, all the poweis of
the Fedeial Government are the free gift of the
States , and none but the commercial power having
been granted to it in regaid to the Indian tribes,
their junsdic ion over them is not m the slightest
degree impaired or limited m any other particular
Having passed  as briefly as I could over the
question of the jurisdiction of a State oyer Indians
within her limit , and especially adverted to the
legislation  of Georgia  towards the Cherokees, it
may be proper that I should say something on the
subject of the emigration  and colonization of the
Indians to the west of the States and Territories of
this Union     Upon  inquiring into the  history of
this subject, the first official notice I have been able
to find of the adoption of the principle of Indian
emigration and colomzatio>, is to be found in the
treaty concluded  wi'h the Cherokees; in  1817, m
which is recognised a pledge given to a portion of
the tribe by President Jefferson early in the year
1809     I have understood, but cannot now lay my
hand upon the document, which may be quoted as
authority,  that one important consideration which
induced Mr   Jefferson to desire the acquisition of
Louisiana, «as to procure an extensive range of
wild country, to which to remove and colonize the
then residing Indians east of the Mississippi.    Be
that as it may, he encouraged the emigration of the
Cherokees as early as January, 1809, urging them
to settle high up the Arkansas and White rivers,
that they might be entirely removed from the neigh-
borhood of the white population, and one of the
provisions of the treaty of 1817 purports to carry
into effect the pledge thus given to the Cherokees,
in 1809, by President Jefferson, and to secure to
them the peaceable possession of their new country
in the West
There is nothing farther in our legislation, or
othei documentary history, so fai as I have been
able to learn, on this subject, until we come down
to the last annual message of President Monroe to
Congress, m December, 1824, in a short paragraph
of which he invites >he attent on of Congress to it,
and urges its adoption. At a subsequent period of
the b?me session of Congress, on the 27th of Janu-
ary , 1825, Mi Monroe communicated a special 
message to Congress,emphatically recommendinga
general plan of Indian emigration and colonization
west of the Mississippi, but Congress then adopted-
no general, or even partial leg station. =o far as ,1
know or believe, in regard to it Earh in the year
1826, troubles having arisen in the Creek nation
the previous year, which resulted in the death of
Tustunnuggee Hadki, the white warrior of Musco-
gee, better known as Geneial Mcintosh, h,s fol-
lowers were anxious to remove to the West, snl
provision was made by law foj tneir emigration
and settlement there.
As has been already stated, m 1828, a treaty
«as made by the Western Cherokees, one of the
objet s of which was to induce the emigration of
that portion of the tribe still remaining, east of the
Mississippi
In the last annual message of President Adams,
communicated to Congress in 1328, he invited its
attention to the general plan of Indian em'gration
as fullv and elao^rately urged in the repon of
Gen. Poitei, the thenSecietary of War. The sub-
ject was again earne-tlj pressei upun the auentio i
of Congress, bv President Jackson, in h's fi-st a -
noal message to Congiess, in December, 1829, and
