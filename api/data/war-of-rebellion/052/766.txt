HDQRS. FIRST BRIG., FOURTH DIV., 23rd ARMY CORPS,Athens, Tenn., September 21, 1863.

COMMANDING OFFICER,

Chattanooga:

I am at Athens, Tenn., with three regiments of men (mounted) and one battery. These are the nearest forces to Chattanooga. Telegraph communication is open from here to Knoxville and east as far as the line of Virginia. All couriers you send here should cross the river at Chattanooga and come by way of Cotton Port. I would be glad to hear the full facts in regard to the heavy firing between Cleveland and Chattanooga on Saturday. All is conjecture here. No news of importance here. I sent a courier yesterday to you with dispatches from General Burnside, and hope you have received them ere this.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

R. K. BYRD,

Colonel, Commanding.
