HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Resaca, Ga., May 16, 1864

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Commanding Fourth Division, 20th Army Corps, and District of Nashville, Nashville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The duty of guarding all railroads to our rear having been assigned to the major-general commanding the department, he directs that you assume, in addition to your present duties, that of to Stevenson, and general charge of the Northwestern Railroad. You will sue for this purpose the five regiments of Indiana cavalry, posting the dismounted portion in the block-houses and placing the mounted portion and as much of the dismounted portion as you see fit at Pulaski, in accordance with your suggestion, contained in your letter of May 16 [13], which has been received. General Granger's brigade has been ordered to Decatur, as you will see by the inclosed special order.*

I also inclose a copy of the order from the headquarters of the Military Division of the Mississippi.+

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Near Resaca, Ga., May 16, 1864.

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Commanding Military District of Nashville:

GENERAL: The enemy having been driven south of Oostenaula River and being in full retreat, it is considered unnecessary to longer keep so many troops along the line of the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad. I is expected, moreover, that the inhabitants of the country will, by their efforts, soon render it unnecessary to keep any troops on the line of the road as far south as Stevenson. You will, therefore, by direction of the major-general commanding the department, have Granger's brigade fully organized and equipped, and send it to join the army at the front with as little delay as possible. The militia ordered to Gallatin, send to Bridgeport, as troops are no longer needed at the former place. You will place all your remaining force in the block-houses, and directions will be given General Gillem to patrol the road with his cavalry. His brigade of cavalry now at Gallatin will be permitted to remain there.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Resaca, Ga., May 16, 1864.

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Commanding District of Nashville:

GENERAL: Your report of the defenses and garrisons on the railroads has been received, but not the inclosures, which please send.
