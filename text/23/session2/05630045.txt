THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

at tl at period in trade but he did not intend to
orgu° the question, his design was simply to
awaken attnntmn to th   subject
Mr BENTON ^aid he vv is pleased to see that
the fff>n le-m in fiom Vngmia [Mr Tylfr] had
ope ned the debate upon the true grounds—the
pimeiplo involved, and the amount apnroonated
in the bill Duimg fourteen years that he (Mr
B ) had tie honor rf ase it on this floor, OTather
dunngtcn yc^-s of that tirrife, ho had nanowly
watched this Lull He had been constantly anx
lous that some genJcman competent to the task
would do justice to it, and place the subject be
foio the American people in the point of viewm
■which it ought to he placed He (Mr B ) had
not had tint to look into the question We had
a \olune of six hundred pages lud on oui tables
some yens ago, which was only an epitome—
no, it was not an epitome, foi that term implied
that the whole subj< ct vas biought out, but it
was only a one sided exhibition of the case, the
papéis being selected by the agent Then reports
ha I been m ide on the subject He meant nothing
unkind in allusion to them, but they had come
foi ward, not in a way to command entire respect
This bill, too, was framed upon this ex parte doc
umtni He did not complain of it, buthe thought
there ought to be a minority leport which should
go into the whole subject The committee who
íeported 'he bill was composed of five, three of
whomv ere well known to be in favor of the claim
Oik gentleman [Mr Preston] was not heie,and
the otl or [Mi Grindy] was literally swamped
in the business of the Post Office, from which
he did not expect to be relieved until the middle
of Icbiuciiy Tiie committee was so named
as that it was impossible to bring the subject
befoic the country He (Mi B) had not time
to examine it now but, if the bill was not to be
galloped through at once, he would take it up
and tiy to make himself master of it He was
\ei) glad that the honoiable gentlemen from Vir
gima [Mi Tyler] had tuined his attention to it
All B said Ins own convictions were strong that
the bill ought not to piss, and he should feel him
self culpable and regardless ot the mteiests of his
countiy if he omitted to give it his attention The
time to which the claims related weie not limited
to 1793, but went back to '7G, they weie not
limited to acts of the revolutionai y Government,
but would include any that could be tiumped up
under Louis XVI ,oi the first jeai of the consul
ate Was there e\er an instance of such an
llhmit ule bill L went back to the time when
there migl t be a citizen of the United States, and
the dooi was opened as widely as possible foi the
admission of claims Language could not be
loosn thin the phraseology of the bill Was
theieany c*>seof s lzuie, of iaptuie, or of confisca
tion, s nee 76, wh ch coild not be pud undei
this bill? The eases under which it was a le^ed
compensa loi only could be made weie widely
diffeient liom the last tieaty with Tiance The
claims under th it treaty were asce-tamod by the
negotiators vv th the utn ost possible precision

pieveut infoimation of the movements of the
lieivh fleet fiom Icing com nunicited to the
Bntish But (Mi B sad) he did not use now
to go into the case, but, if the bill was not to be
galloped thirugl , he begged to say that he had
some acts, both as to i s puncipks and details,
which h   wished to lay before the Senate
Mi   PRLSTOX said that   as the honoiable
gentleman fiom Missoun had ahuded to 1  m in
his i mtiks, he f It bound to say a wold nicxpla
natn n     He would be glad if that gentkma l, and
the honoiable member tion Vngmia, [Mi   Tv
llb,] would giu a thiicughinvcstigitim to this
subj ct     He  (Ml   P )  had been placed on  the
comnntttt, he suppo ed, in seme soit, by aci
d i t, peih tps because he came from a section of
countiy  known   to be onpos d  to extiavagant
expenditures of th" pul he money     He had in
vestig ted the documents to which the gel tl man
alludtd, ant, the fuorible íepoit of Mi   Liung
Eton on the subject, aid he had fcrmed 1 is opm
ion of the mei its of these claims from them    He
took the only report there Vias against them,
and gave the whole his undivided attention as
a friend  desirous of supporting  them, but he
found them altogether untenable     The amount
of the claim was an obstacle to its pvssage, but
he did not view that as any consequence, com
pared  with  the  punciple  involved      Whcthei
it was five millions or five hundied millions, it
made no difference with him     If the honoi oi
honesty of the nation was implicated, he cared
not how much of blood or of money it might cost,
he would support it, whethei it was for claims
antenoi oi subsequent to 1800     Many of these
claimants  were   his  constituents,   widows  and
children, and theiefoie he felt a friendly disposi
tion tovvaids them     But there were dangerous
and dehepte questions invohed in it which re
quned dehbciate and close attention     This he
was notable to give it now     As regaided the
tieaty of 1798, b} which these claims were com
piomised, he did not considi rthem stiengthened
by that act   We were willing to have giv n three
times the amount specified in this bill to have
bought ourselves from the trammels of that treaty
Mr BENTON ieplied,thattliegeiitlcmaiifiom
South Carolina [Mr Pkestox] thought the mag
nitude of the claims presented an obstacle to the
passage of the bill     He believed that, when that
gentleman had more expenence here, the course
of our legislation would convince him that it was
claims of vast magnitude which were most suc-
cessful, that precisely m propoition to its mass
its momentum was mcieased—its chance of get
ting through was enhanced     It was the millions
which rolled along rapidly, while the small claims
were airestcd and laid by in the mass of unfin
ished  business     When the  honoiable member
had been as long heie as he (Mi   B ) had been,
he would not be surprised at what he now said
The Senatoi fiom South Carolina had alluded to
Mr  Livingston's report on the subject     And al
though he (Mi   B ) had the greatest respect foi
that gentleman's talents and honoi, yet in money
matters he was a child     This claim (said Mr
B ) is in leality owned by assignees, who bought
fiom the oiigmal claimants for a few cents in the
dollai, oi insureis, who received tl eir piemmm
for all the vessels they insured, whethei   lost or
saved, and is the United States to turn insurer
for them, and pay for every  vessel lost'    The
Senator  from  South   Carolina   [Mr   Presto\]
said, there were widows and oiphans in his State
who weie claimants     Mr B said, the old certi-
ficate funding act of 1791 was plead in the name
of old soldieis, who had sold to speculators at
two and sixpence in the pound, and to whom
Congiess voted thirty shillings m   the   pound
The magnitude of this claim was carrying it along,
(Mr B said,) as the magnitude of the assumption
b 11 earned that, foi twenty five millions  and the
magnitude of the ccitificate funding bill carried
it     They got through immediate!} , while Amy
Daiden's hoise, at $150 did not get through until
foity years     He was opposed to voting millions
to speculatois, who buy claims foi a trifle on the
Government, he would not  make  the  Fedeial
Government msuie the insuieis     He would re
sist this bill, though he might have to study the
folio volume of one thousand pag-^s which con-
tained its lnstoi}    he would not be lestncted to
the ex paite document, compiled undei the direc
tion of the agent, as he had been informed   but
would look to the whole case     He would defend
| the Treasmy fiom this enoimo is attack upon it
Ho would do 1 -nth foi his country, and call upon
otheis to help
Mi SHEPLEY said he had been alluded to as
a member of the committee which had reported
this bill that, as he hid never befoie been on t! is
committee, it would be icadily s ipposed that he
' had made up his opinion hastily o i the subject,
I but  hit he h id, pievious to the meeting of the
Senate, examined this question, not as a com
mittcemai , but as a Senatoi, n which capacity
he expected to be called upon to act, and had
prepued hinsclf accordm ly He hid not come
with nii'fin1  fn the fight hi had copies of the
documents befoie him, fiom an examination of
which he had dtawn his conclusions but he
could show the Senate how he nad examined and
wheie he haa found his mateiials Piom sources
of undoubted aiithout) , fion the pi nted docu
ments of th s Government, he had diawn his
conclusions and come to the conviction that those
claims were just and ought to be satisfied by this
country These claims against France were good,
and might have been recovered of that Govern-
ment, that they weie worth as much as those for
which -v e had obtained indemnities from Spam,
Denmaik, and other Governments, that they
weieiegaidedsom our negotiations with Prance
That if they had been uiged with the same per-
severance as oui claims upon other nations and
undei othei cucumstances have been, reparation
would have been made by Piancc But why
were these claims neglected — why not pressed
by this Government till allowed' The reason is
obvious because France set up claims against
us—claims which we were bound by solemn
obligation to allow We had guaiantied to
Frmce her possessions in West India, in th 
eleventh amele of theueaty, wlieiem she had
bo ind heiself to obtain foi us independence, also
other claims under the seventeenth and twenty-
second aiticles of the treaty of commerce We
had failed to fulfill these stipulations, we had
shrunk fiom the contest, and left Prance to be
robbed of hei possesoion, without raising a finger
in her behalf Foi these infractions, France
justly claimed of us some lemuneiation—some
offset for the neglect of her mteiests, and the
losses she had sustained thereby She offered—
nay, she uiged, the United States to appoint a
commission to investigate these claims, and wat
ready to pay, to the utmost farthing, all that
could be justly biought against hei But then
she claimed of us more than the sum of oui claims
upon her The United States offeied to com-
pensate her, if sue would accept of five million
francs, foi a releise of oui obligations under the
eleventh aiticle of the tie'ty of alliance, but she
would not accept it, but offered to receive ten
millions, which we refused But these claims of
Fiance weie finally set off against the claims
of oui citizens, and thus the United States, in
leleasing Fiance, has bound herself to discharge
the claims that our citizens had upon France
Mr S said, that it had been uiged that the
opinions of the fnends of this bill had been formed
upon pai tial views of the subject But if the gen-
tlemen wish for the proof, he could show from
official documents the facts to which he alluded
He did not believe that official documents of this
Government piesented two diiectly opposite and
comradictoiy piopositions He íehed on the
documents—did not use with a design to enter
into an examination of them page by page, section
by section, but would íefer those gentlemen who
wgie desnous of invest gating this subject to them
for pi oof of all he had advanced, and was willing
to exhibit these proofs fi om the public documents
on to morrow, oi atany othei time when ltshould
be the pleasuie of the Scnite to hear him
On motion of Mr WFBSTER, the Senate
adjourned
