[Inclosure No. 2.] CHURCH ROAD SIGNAL STATION, January 16, 1865-5 p.m.

Captain THICKSTUN:

There are no troops moving on either Boydton or Cox roads, neither can I discover any wagons moving on either of those roads. There has been a regiment of enemy's infantry (about 500 strong) drawn up in line and inspected. They now have returned to their quarters, about half a mile to our right of the Boisseau property. There has been a working party (about 150 strong) at work near the Boydton road, at a point about twenty degrees north of west. They were a good deal scattered, but I was unable to determine what they are doing. A train of cars just passed, in direction of Petersburg, on South Side Railroad. During the day I have noticed seventy wagons moving westward on Cox road, and twenty moving in direction of Petersburg on same road. No trains of more than six wagons noticed.

The officer commanding picket-line near Boswell's house judges the force to have been about 2,000, and twenty wagons. The force moved toward the right of the enemy's line.
