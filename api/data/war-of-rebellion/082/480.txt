HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, FOURTH DIV., 9TH ARMY CORPS, July 26, 1864-8 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND, A. A. G., Ninth Army Corps:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I was relieved this morning as general officer of the trenches by Brigadier-General Bartlett. Nothing occurred in front of the First Division except the blowing up of a caisson. The front of the Third Division was reduced in length nearly one-half yesterday. The officer of the day of that division reports that more frequent changes of the men in the trenches is desirable and almost necessary, their losses being constant and their labors severe. In making my morning inspection of the trenches yesterday I found that the policing was poorly done and that no attention had been paid to draining. Both these evils I ordered remedied as soon as possible. Captain Young, officer of the day, Third Division, Ninth Corps, reports a great improvement in respect both to draining and policing in the trenches occupied by his division. The officer of the day of the Second Division has failed to send me his report.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY G. THOMAS,

Colonel 19th U. S. Colored Troops and General Officer of the Trenches.

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that nothing unusual has taken place along my front during the past twelve hours. The firing on our left was extremely heavy about midnight, and in our front the enemy's pickets displayed rather more activity than common. The traverses on the right of the front line, occupied by one of my brigades, were considerably strengthened during the night.

I have the honor to be, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,JAMES H. LEDLIE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
