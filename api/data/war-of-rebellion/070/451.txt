WASHINGTON CITY, May 13, 1864.-11.40 a. m.

His Excellency Governor BRADFORD,

Annapolis:

In the present juncture it might be of great service if you would call out 2,000 of your State militia to take charge of the works in Baltimore and relieve the same number of other troops for the period of 100 days, and upon the same agreed upon by the President and the Governors of Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and Wisconsin. Our arms now appear to be victorious, and a helping hand at the present moment from you might contribute greatly to the speedy restoration of peace. Will you do this? Please answer immediately.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

May 13, 1864.-9.50 p. m.

Governor PARKER,

Trenton, N. J.:

The brilliant success of the Army of the Potomac against the rebel army indicates that an increase of the force at this juncture for a short period might contribute greatly to the completion of General Grant's work and the speedy restoration of peace by the capture or destruction of the rebel forces. Congress has made provision for the employment of troops for a short term. The President desires to know whether your State could give us a militia force that a hundred days, and what number, and within what time you could call in into the field. Will you favor me with a speedy answer?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
