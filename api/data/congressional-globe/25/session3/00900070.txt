The question being on the amendment of Mi
Loomis,
Mi   GARLAND, of Virginia, resumed     He
would not go into an argument, as he was undei
pledge to renew the demand  foi   the  pievious
question     He certainly believed, as the gentle
man fiom Michigan [Mi   Craky] liad stated,
that,  in  some  instantes,  balances  did  appear
against public agents who wcie not guilty     It
was light and  piopei  that eorrections in sue-
cascs should be made     When they weie made,
they would accompany the piesi nt doeeinients as
they vvue suit out to th< countiy, and  then the
countiy would know the whole sybti m fiom hi ad

thosi   fai ts to the bottom, and developing  the
whole truth, he would go with gentlcitie n 11 my
extent
In accoidancc with his pledge  In renewed the
di inand for the previous qui stion   but Mi   Wn
hams having leicasod him fiom the pionuse, the
demand toi the pievious, question was again with
drawn
Mr DUNCAN said, if he undcistood himself,
he snould be the last m tn to suppiess thi public i
tion of anything that was calculated to enlighten
the minds of the people, and, if he understood
himself, he would be the last man to do anything
having a tendency to cover the iniquity oi the
fiaud of any officet in any depai tment of the Gov-
ernment But when had the House been out of
the sound of chaiges against the Government of
extravagance and piofl^acy It was a standing
ch uge When the membeisof the Administration
p Hy vo'eel to ictiench, it was attributed to lm
pu pei motives—to a desire to cover up the in
lquity of the vauous elcpaitments of the Govern
ment—the demagogism—oi to some; snns'cr m
fluence He cared not what the question might
be, with that end in view, it was at once and in-
variably met with a ciy of coirupt motives
Mi  D alluded to the care and caution leqimed '
for the protection of the public money, in the j
three leadings of bills in both Houses, before a i
dollar could be expended, and yet gentlemen in- |
trotlueed a íesolution to expend  twenty, thnty,
oi forty thousand dollars to no pui pose whatever, '
and  that resolution was to be adopted  in five
minutes, and almost without a word being said
He hoped it would not be agreed to    He objected
to its adoption, because no good could grow out
of it, and because, as had been stated, the charac
ters of innocent men would be injured, for theie
weie some appealing as dcfaulteis who weie not
so      i'o publish mfoimation of such a character
would be to do an injustice which nevei could be
leinedieel     The veiy least that could be done on
behalf of those who might be injured, would be
to re fer the documents to a committee, to see what
poitions ought, injustice, to be published
lie would move, howcvti, to lay the whole
subject on the table But Mr D withdrew the
motion, at the tequest of several gentlemen
Mi KRONSON, tftei alluding to the mxnnei
in whiththesi documi nts had sevually been pub
lished at the last session of Congiess, by oidei of
the House, and to the injustice whit Ii one of these

Ml PliCNTISS, of Mississippi, said he was
as well pleased as th gentleman who had just
taken his seat at wi'nessing the sensat on in cer
tain parts of this House at eveiy flesh haul of
tiuth fiom thegieatdeep ot this Vduunisu itmn's
secrets The great oyster bed had not been dis-
turbed for years, now, and he did not doubt that
anothei gtab would bring upon water laiger and
fatteroysters than any which had yet been opened
Yes, there were other fine fish below, which had
not yet been hooked up or speaied He was for
trying all ways to get at them, lines, nets, spears,
harpoons, any means and all means he was foi
trying, so that by some means the fish might be
made to appear above watei He was happy to
perceive, fiom some symptoms of compunction
on the other side, that the party was not as yet
" desperately wicked," they were not judicially
haidened, theie was some little nucleus of moral
punciple, around which better feelings might yet
clustei, so as to leave a hope that they might still
be snatched as biands from the burning He
had begun to think that the skin of this Admin-
istration was like that of therhinoceios, insensible
to all attacks, and pioof against the keenest dart,
but he now began to have a better hope Ihe
Globe might admonish and warn and cntieat, but
it was in vam, the Globe could not stop this de-
batí on coiruption It would goon, the nation
would hear it Gentlemen did not like this woid
" conuption," but if he thought their eais were
not callo is, he would buy a starling, ard have it
taught to cry nothing but "conuption1" He
would find the ■idmimstiation when it lay asleep,
and in its ear he would halloo " corruption' coi-
ruption' conuption'" He would not, according
to tin advne of the gentleman fiom New "\oik
over the way, [Mi Cambrlilng ] have the an-
atomical Uibseetions confined to dead subjects,
no theie weie pi nty of living ones whose lm-
posthumts nei dtd the knif He tuisted these
documents would oe published he wanted them
foi two puiposes fiist foi lessons of molality,
and then as models of the King's English His
ft lend had said they would cut like a two edged
swoid   ay, like a (/nee edged one
Mi AII1LRTON said hemeiely rose to reply
to a single lemaik made by the gentleman fiom
Mississippi, [Mi Prentiss ] That gentleman
had suel he would continually ciy out " corrup-
tion" against this Admnnstiation, nay, he would
buy a stalling which should be taught to speak
noilung but " conuption, corruption " Mr A
would make the reply, which was once made in
the British Paihament on a similar occasion The
member of Puliament to whom he alluded, said
m leply to a similai lem uk, that gentlemen need
not tiouble tin mselves to buy a stalling for that
pmposi Tor as long as they themselves kept
coiitinu illy utteimg the same woids, with just as
much íeason and meaning as the stalling would
have in uttering them, the words would pioduce,
no doubt, just as much effect as if the stalling
himself should speak them
Mr THOMAS expiessed a reluctance to pro-
long this desultory debate, and yet he must con-
sent to do so, oi to vote without having the reasons
upon which his vote would be founded piesented
to the public No one who had participated in
the discussion had stated the consideiations by
which he was governed
1 ho question before the House was complex
It had a double aspect The resolution originally
piesented called for the publication of ccitam
documents The gen leraan fiom Virginia [Mi
GaklaydJ had moved an amendment to thisieso-
lution, lequning the Secretary of the Tieasury to
commumcite fui the r information conceinine the
defaults of public oihceis This amendment has
been a< cepted by the men er of the original resolu-
tion, and thus two questions, not necessarily con-
nected, are blended in one proposition A votefor
oi against this pioposition could not be satisfacto-
rily given Many members, like himself, may be
willing to call upon the Secretaiy for furthei in-
formation, and, neveithele&s, be hostile to the pas
sage of that part of this íesolution authouzing the
publ cation of twenty thousand copies oí ceitain
public documents To relieve us from this em-
baí lassment, the gentleman from New York [Mr
LoomisJ has nroposed to strike outof this amend-
ed resolution all that pait that relates to the pub-
lication of the documents, and for this ptoposed
amendment Mi   T  was prepared to vote
He was opposed to the publication designed to
be made, and would give his icasons touching
each die tment sepnately 11ns would be done
legardiess of deni Delation or declamation from
any quaiter of the House    There is shrewd-
