NEAR NAVY-YARD, June 23, 1863-10. 10 p. m.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Forty pontoons and equipage started from here at 10. 15 p. m., to hurry through the Georgetown locks. At this hour, 32 more, pontoons and equipage, the balance for 1, 450 feet of bridge, started, as I have judged it safest to send all from here. I expect the bridge to reach the Monocacy on the evening of the 24th.

H. W. BENHAM,

Brigadier-General.

WASHINGTON, June 23, 1863.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Dispatch of Adjutant-General Moses just received. I do not distinctly understand what is meant be the "timber bridging, " called for by the telegram, but believing that a wooden pontoon bridge 1, 400 feet long is required at the Monocacy, I shall, unless otherwise directed, order that to be sent; 1, 200 feet from this depot, which can be sent by or before midnight, to be joined by 200 feet of surplus bridge now with Captain Turnbull at Edwards Ferry, whom I shall direct to send it with a portion of the volunteer engineers now with him.
