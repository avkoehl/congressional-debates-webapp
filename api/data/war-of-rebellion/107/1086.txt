Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Last night I heard that Gregg's pickets were attacked. The peculiar manner of the citizens in this quarter, the lurking of spies and guerrillas in the neighbhorhood, and the extreme quiet of the enemy have excited my suspicion that a raid or larger movement of the enemy is contemplated. I have sent scouting, parties through Thoroughfare Gap toward Salem, toward Aldie, to Brentsville, and that region. In case of a raid on Manassas Junction, Bristoe, Cattlett's or Warenton Junction, please remember I have a small force and much stationed; in fact, but three brigades and one regiment altogether.

Have you any specific instructions for me in either case?

C. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
