WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, 27TH, VIA DUBLIN,

August 28, 1863.

GENERAL: We met the enemy yesterday morning about a mile and a half from this place on road to the Warm Springs. Fought from 9 a. m. to 7 p. m. Every attack made by the enemy was repulsed. At night each side occupied the same position they had in the morning. This morning the enemy made two other attacks, which were handsomely repulsed, when he abandoned his position, and retreated toward Warm Springs, pursued by cavalry and artillery.

The troops engaged were the First Brigade of this army, Colonel George S. Patton commanding; the enemy about 3,000, and 6 pieces of artillery, under Brigadier-General Averell.

Our loss about 200 killed and wounded. Enemy's loss not known. We have taken about 150 prisoners and a piece of artillery.

WARM SPRINGS, VIA STAUNTON,

August 30, 1863.

GENERAL: The enemy that fought us on the 26th and 27th retreated very rapidly by Huntersville, and passed Greenbrier Bridge at Marling's Bottom early yesterday morning. My cavalry pursued them to that point, and a small force still following them. A part of Colonel Wharton's brigade arrived here yesterday. Jenkins' cavalry was about 3 miles west of Staunton last evening, coming on to this place. From what I hear of Imboden he was probably at Monterey last night, with the intention of moving on to Huntersville. I fear he cannot reach there in time to intercept the retreating enemy. They have been severely punished, and when they reach Beverly will not, I think, be fit for service for several weeks. A captain of artillery, whom I have prisoner, says they started from Moorefield with between 4,000 and 5,000.
