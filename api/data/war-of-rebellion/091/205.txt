large amount of Government property, railroad equipments, and important bridges. I cannot learn positively what force this is, or who is in command, but it is believed to be a portion of Echols'.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

(Copies sent to Generals Grant and Sheridan.)

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 28, 1864.

General KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

You must make the best disposition to resist the raid in your power, by drawing in your forces to the most important points and having transportation ready to concentrate them wherever the enemy attacks. We cannot help you now from here.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CUMBERLAND, MD., September 28, 1864 - 8 p. m.

(Received 9.30 a. m. 29th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel Wilkinson reports that a citizen scout sent to Buckhannon last night was captured there this morning and paroled by General Echols and returned this evening. He reports the rebel force holding Buckhannon to be 1,500 strong, and that another portion of the force had gone toward Beverly. This really seems to be a formidable raid, commanded by General Echols in person. I cannot raise for the defense of Clarksburg and Grafton more than 700 or 800 men.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, September 28, 1864.

Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling:

Colonel Wilkinson reports Buckhannon held by 1,500 rebels, in command of General Echols. Will it be possible to raise force of a few hundred volunteers to defend Grafton? If so, send them out as soon as possible.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

WHEELING, September 28, 1864.

General KELLEY:

I do not know where to get volunteers. The militia of Harrison, Taylor, and Marion Counties have been called out, and are under command of Brigadier-General Bunker at Fairmont. He is subject to your orders, and will call out the militia of other counties if you request. I will direct him to obey your orders.

A. I. BOREMAN,

Governor.
