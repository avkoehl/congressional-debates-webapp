HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo. April 21, 1863.

MAJOR: I have to report that the enemy (whose strength is variously estimated from 2,000 to 4,000, with the two pieces of artillery, and under Marmaduke) drove Smart's regiment out of Patterson yesterday, one of my outposts, and that Smart has fallen back upon Knob. His loss in said to be 200 in killed, wounded, and missing.*

I suspend further report and opinion until all the details reach me. Appended are copies of my order to Smart, preparing him for such possible contingency.

The remaining movable troops of the district are being rapidly put in position at the Knob, and Glover, with two regiments of cavalry and four pieces, has been ordered to ascertain the whereabouts of Marmaduke, as Smart has lost hold of him.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major H. Z. CURTIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
