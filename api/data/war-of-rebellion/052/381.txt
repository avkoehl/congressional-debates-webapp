Major-General ROSECRANS,

Near Chattanooga, Tenn.:

You give me no information of the position of Bragg and Buckner. If they have united, it is important that you and Burnside unite as quickly as possible, so that the enemy may not attack you separately.

TRENTON, GA., September 6, 1863-11 p.m.

(Received 8 p.m., 7th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I reached this place to-day. Crittenden has pushed up near the point of Lookout Mountain. Enemy still in force in Chattanooga, threatening to cross the river. All reports concur that Johnston and Breckinridge are with Bragg. Buckner is closing down, and has destroyed the bridge at Loudon. Enemy attempting to-day to obstruct passes of Lookout Mountain. Some skirmishing at Davis' Gap; 12 rebels captured. Lookout is a formidable mountain, even more so that Raccoon, just crossed; 1,000 feet high, with but three passes in 40 miles. No word from Burnside.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
