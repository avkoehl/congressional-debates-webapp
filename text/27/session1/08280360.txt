And who, Mr President, speaks with authority on this sub-
ject, oc who, if he could, ought to speak with such autho
rkyl Who knows what are the view  and opinions ot the
Other branch of Congress, or of the Executive How do
We know what will and what will not be favorably received
elsewhere? Who is empowered to rise m his place in this
Chamber and urge the adoption of this amendment on the
ground that if we do not accept of this we snail < ei uinly lose
ail? Nosuch authority is claimed, none * írh h*-* been stated
On the contrary, it has been expressly disclaimed.
But, sir, what have we todowiüithe opmionsofotheis— of
ihoee who coroposea branch of Urn Ltfguda ive department,
•itung at the  other end of this building   oi   of the  high
functionary who may be requiied to examine and act upon
thit great measure?   Who are we, and what are our duties'!
We   are   the American Senate—an independent btanch 0!
the? Congress of the United átate     We are sent here to
consult together, and to act for the honoraud interests of out
common c -untry, to remain her rights, to promote her wtl
fare    In the measures wemay be called to consider, weare to
our   aid   our patnotism, our knowledge,  our experience
We are to obtain all such information as may lead to cor
rect and useful results    We aie to  perfoim Our consutu
tional duties, under all the responsibilities which rest upon
vi and under a deep sense of theimpoitaneeof those duties
we are to ask no counsel of our ifars      In forming our
«pinions, or Casting our voted, we are not to inquire in ad-
vance what are the views of others wtiomiy be called to ex
preae their opinions.    We have nothing to do with the remete
eonsequence of our acts, when satisfied that duty íequnes
their performance    We are to ascertain what duty demands,
anifeailessly and resolutely to discharge it    Having once en
tared upoo that path, wo should walk m it, without mining
-either to the right hand oi to the left, ¿n i then come *vhai may,
wetiaed not iear the upbraidlngs of cons lence, nor the denun
fetatlonaof the virtuous    Toothers must bel* ft their share of
responsibility    When they are called to act, they must, and
doubtless will, act under the same weight of the importance of
their duties as rests upon us    We are not to go eitoei to ale
gwlative hall, or an executive mansion, to learn what will be
acceptable there    The time has notfyet come when the Senate
of the Unhed States will be called upon to bow to any bucIi im-
plied dictation    JSo,sir,no.   We have not been asked, an!
shalt not be, to conform our opinions to the views of those who
imay hereafter be called to act on (he subject, undei  equal re
tponsibilities with ourselves    We do not even know what
their opinions are    I shall vote uninfluenced by any supposed
embarrassments which may possibly anee eUewhete, and the
spirit of independence which has characterized the ancient,
honorable, intelligent, and patriotic Commonwealth which has
given me this seat of honor and trust, shall neither be lost not
impaired in my person    But I leave this unpleasant topic    It
has no relevancy to thepointl am considenng    It Iips not been
alluded to by anyone with any unfcind feeling, oi horn any
but the puiest motives    La us forget that i* 1ms been men
ttoued
I proceed now to consider the only giound of expediency on
which theadjptitm ol this amendment has bean placed—and it
has been preaented with all the forte of argument, and powei
oí e!oquon<*e, which belong to the distiagaished gentlemen who
have Ursjed it We have been remindelifhat ail things which
«re lawful are not convenient, that mere a ¿ottiuns of powei
are oftentimes dangerous, and that concessit  and compro
Wm*n, without sacrifices of principle, often puxm e (he most
hippy results, that it is not to beconcealed that theje are many
honest and patriotic utizene who doubt, certainly, if they do
not dery, the c institutional powor of Congress to locate offices
ofdweount mtheStatei without their asseui, that the adoption
of the amendment, while it denies no power heretofore claimed,
merely withholds the exercise of u; and that, in this way all
constitutional acrupí i wtU be removed, all preconceived opi
nions remain undisturhed, all secuonal jtabusies allayed, all
State pride untouched, all appi it ensioi s of d tnget lenioved.
It would obviate the wiupk o/ eminent fnen a, an i t,iveto the
Country a B ink, which would diaaim mm hoi the ho&ithtv now
prevailing dgtiMjí. «tu h an intuitu ion, and enable it to lead a
more quiet, ( cacefulltie than if eipuvd to the elleaa resulting
from the jetlou&ies and scruples of State a¡ovojeij,ntus I n -
tend to mei-t this argument ior conciliation and cum pt muse n
the same fiank and genetous spirit m which it has been offeied
to us It lialairaigurnent, which deserves and ehalt reune
all the consideration to winch its merits entitle it And I take
the occasion to say, jt is the only argument which has been
urged by moat of those who have spoken m favoi oi the amend
ment—the ground of ihe unconstitutionality oi the act ii«tt hav
lug been uiged,but repudiated by most of them
My first answer to ttneprup'siuun of compromise is, that it
is impossible lor me to perceive how it ran satiaiy the sc tuples
of those who deny the power of tongieas to cierte offices oí
discount and dtposite against the wishes ot the States !t is
true, by th<5 amendment, their absent i*< requiied toiheebit
bhshment ofsuch offices, but it is not teqi ued to the creation
ofageuci s in the respective States, clothed with eveiy bank
log power except that of dibcouonii3 notes I liave adverted
to this topic ma previous part of the discussion, for a ddfei
ent purpose I revert to it again a? peitinent to the pitsent
inquiry, for it is veiy difficult fot meto see how the object oí
the amendment can be attained—that of removing out of the
way constitutioialscruples, while the other pans oí the amend
ment are retained Is it so that the powei to discount notes m
a State cannot bo conferred by an act of Congress, hi the foim
of a bank chatter, and yeta power begtanted to exercise eveiy
other banking privilege? Cm those who suppose an office of
discount and deposite cannot be established, even although
deemed necessary by Cnngre-^ to aid the legitimate operations
of the Treasury, show that in officcof deposite toieetive and
pay out moneys, de ü in gold and Oliver, and in exchange" cm
be constitution all y created to au, within tht, limiu and operate
upon the interests of the Mates 1 11 w can these 'woiowpis
when considered proper and necean y by Congress to be^vei
used, be disunited, and the ono be deemed lawtul an 1 the oi iei
unconstitutional What eviler ce have we that the section aa
modified by this amendment, will be acceptable to all who are
jealous of State rights fearful of dangers from locating branches
in the States, and desirous of placing them under State autr-o
nty? Until we have such evidence, why should we be ask«d
to give up our convictions of right anu expediency as a peace
offering duetotli<> spirit of conciliation and compromise? Why
$honld we, in advance, yield a pomtJ,which we consider im
por ant, until we are satisfied that, by yielding it, we shall put
an end to ah jealousies heart bunnnss andforebodrngs of evil!
If these agencies proposed to be established arenotmeppective
of, and irresponsible to, State authority, th«y can be taxed, and
otherwise dealt with, as the lawful powei of the State may di
rect; and then no one would subscribe to the stock—probably
not a share oí it would be taken But if ihey are uncontiolla
ble by State 'aws, as they certainly are, if, in consequence of
their creation by on act of Congress, they depend upon that act
foi their existence and power, why then, they aie a bank of
discount and deposite in another form, and while the assent of
the. States is required to an office of discount n is not asked nor
required for the location of agencies which aie to produce
nearly the same results I leave Uto those who think that, in
reference to the question of constitutional power, there is a
substantial difference between the two foims oí effecting the
same object, to point it out, and I especially commendto those
who suppose the one mode 10 be constitutional, and the other
not, the inquiry whether a majority of tho^e who arejeaious of
the exercise of Fedeial power will consider thisam°n Iment
as possessing either the form or the substance of a compromise
But another answer may be given to the argument ofexpedi
ncy which has been urged on this occasion And that is, that
in my opinion, the number of tbo&e who deny the powet of
C ngre^s to establish thf offices of discount is very limited and
theref >re ihete are but few who will ask for the adoption of
tins proposition of compromise I necessarily speak from my
owi view oí the ex ent of the opposition to the existence of
this power, but I believe, since the repeated acts  of legislation—
the decided o[ intons of many of the distinguished etatemui of
the country some of who t> are dead, and some living—the ie
pealed n ^nnions by Congie^s, and the solemn densiona of
the Supreme i > >rt public opinion haa vei y much set'Ied down
in the convuiii n that the power is no 1  ngei to be denied
Whatever opinions may have been enteiumed on the abstiac'
question, the general sense of the nation h a been expressed in
iavurofnot distuibmg it, and against treating it as a matter
doubiful and open to disputation I am awaie that this is not
the universal sentiment I know that many excellent citizens,
many distinguished public men, many of the most honoiahle
and patriotic of our people, consider this matter open and
unsettled and yet retain all their former opinions SuH how
ever, Ibehevc thenumbet not to be laige «ind, with the excep
tion of such whose feelings ind opinions aie always to be ie*
garded with kindtessand remcct, and some otheis wl o alwaj s
endeavor to ma fits political capita! out oi almost every subjeet
ol public concern that ivie ereat body oí the American people
have come toil t conclusion that the powei claimed and asserted
in the hill as reponed by th« committee evi&ts and maybe en-
forced Opposed as they may have been ( ngmally to its asser

queitim of power    As 1 have said befoie,  the people gene
lally have not wi&hed to disturb a matter whieh has so long
heen at lest    Although many may deprecate the creat on of i
ttiink of the Ihu ed State¡s, the con^tituuonal right to establish it
is much leas denied than formerly    1 sincerely believe that,
among al! the disputed points of constitutional law which have

the more absorbing topic of the ncht to establish a Bank at

is presented to a State to obfam us a^ent to the location of an
office within its limits, one of the principal topics of debate will
be whether any powet P2ust8 to give such assent as w'll justify
that location?   I put this  inquiry  to  those whojttunk^this

selves in hostility to the es ablishment of a branch    They may
enter the political arena, and candidates for the Legislature may
be selecred and voted for m reference to their opinions on this
subject    Thus the question of Bank or no Bank may become
a p ditical question, and parties and State  institutions may be
arrayed at the polls, S^ate pude beappealed to, State jealousies
be fostered, anda mere question of expediency maybe turned
into a question of parly politics,  or be made to depend m a
measure upon selfish considerations, irrespective of me pubi c
good    But to this ariay of opposition from   interested indivi-
duáis and corporation*, from political demagogues and self! h
politicians andfroja paity predilections, for patty purposes,
are to be aaded ofJ^|r matters which will not fail to create di-
visions and dissensions,  and ultimately   perhaps deprive the
nation and the people of the States^ of the benefit of an office of
discount and deposite    In many of the States a great desire
vidl probably be manifested 'o impose conditions to the location
ofabranch, andlhave no loubt great exertions will   be made
to impose them and it would not certainly be matter of surprise
\\ some of them shouldrrevail   Ihere may be almostas many ^
different proj cts, sjgsested m the foim oi conditions, as there*
are memherbof the legislative body, but among tho«e  which
willpiobably be the most prominent, and the most favorably
received, aie the following
First That the capital emp^yed at the branch be taxed to
the eame extent as the banking institutions of thQ State Thia
will be a popular condition and will be urged as being perfect*
lyju-st It will be said that there is no sufficient reason why the
stockholders of a State bank should be íeejuirtd to deduct from
their dividends agiven sum, by way of tax upon the franchise
of banking, aid ti e stoekholders of the Bdnkof the United
States  he exempted iiom u, that it is just both should pay for
the franchise in the F?me way, and to the same extent With
out sufficiently attending to the wed defined distinction, that
th&pewei to tax th° Batik,asa corporation may be abused,
so as destroy thefianciiise and thub defeit all the national pur*
poses destined bythe estabhsl ment ofa branch in a particular
State, 'hesubject is viewedonly in ieferenceio"1whatis suppos-
el to bean smpropei diauncttor between a Sute and a national
institution, and the light and the equity of imposiug the tax
will be uiged and insisted on, and would it be t o much to s^y
that, m many JJt tes the aigument would pievail? And if it
should, or if it*is believed by capitalists that it would be suc-
cessful is it probable they would subscríbelo the s ockj and
that the «uoscription would be filled up*
Second \noihei portion of the membeis of the Legislature
might deem it pioperto say, previous to granting the assent
asked thit is the in mutiun ^o'icted the pnviiege of doing
business wnhm the limi s of the State, i  would be not only
pru lent, but right, ior the ¡state to have someaeency in is
management, and therefore ought to require as acondiuon,
that the Sta e may select one peison at leasi to be a dnector m
the branch Tbi^ would be urged on the ground that there
ought to be noihi g concealed fiom the knowledge of a confi-
dential officer of the ¡state in the transactions oft he lnstiiuuoo;
that it is the duty ill thp S^ate to protect the lights of ne own
citizens, ¿nú as the business operations of the Bank would
more orhssaflect individual* , it would be very proper that
protection should be afforded them, in 'he foim proposed It
would also be said that, so far frota causing anv injury to the
Bank, it would tend to allay any fears which migh' exist from"
the influence ofa foieign msiuutn n.and consequently that the
Rdnksh. u'd i ¡*her solicit than object to such a supervision.
Such a pioposition would piobably find some advocates, and
might combine other interests inns support
Thud Arothei class of legislators would urge the propriety
an 1 necessity ol supeiaddmg to the consent of the Slate a pro-
vision ret?mmg the right ti withdtaw it, after the lapse nf a
specified penod of time This would be presented to tfieconsi*
deration of membeis, a? a mattPi of much consequence It
woul 1 be "aid that the state of things might hereaiter be such
in the Commonwealth as torendei ihe continuance of a bnnch
irjunous to the interests and obnoxious to the fef lings of the
people, that it might come m conflict with their State institu-
tions, and produce broils ard jedloueie", ard mutual crimina-
tions and recrimination*, that i' might bosomaniged aa to
give just cause of nfienre that its opeiations might come m
collision with the interests of the State, ard that a due regard
to the sovereignty, the right", and the authority of the State.
would requne tha< a po^er should be leseived to it, to annul
the act giving the assent, and, un'ess that was acquiesced in,
the assent ought, in the first instance, to he withheld This
p oposmm would receive some sjpport, and enlist many
advocates
Fourth There would probably be, in some of the States, a
bitter controvetsy as to the place m the State where the branch
should be located It is not to be disguised that th-re are rival
cities in the same State, each of which would urge its claims to
be selec'ed as the place foi locating the office And there ftre
few matteis which engendei more hard feelings, and occasion
moie serious contiovetsy, than those which relate to the selec-
tion of a place (among many whidi aie named for it) foi the
establishment of an important public institution How often
h*s it been heen, m the efforts made to obtain 'he establishment
ofa State bank, or abraneh of it, a State hospital, an asylum
for the deaf and dumb oi the blind, and even o'" a peniten-
tial y Something of the same spirit would be manifested m
relation to the location of an office of discount and deposite
Each city would have it« fntnd-sai d supporters .each would
ctT siderita claims ¿i the mosr meritr*-] jit= , an^, while contend-
ing for the prize the mteies s of the *s ate and nation migrht be
overlooked m the fieice contests which would exist, and the ex-
asperation might an<;e to such a decree as that a im]orny could
not be found m favor of any place, and should a majority
agree, the piece might be quite unsuitable, and, in the opinion
of the Bank, one which they could not approve- These are a
few of the conditions which might beimposedupontheBank, as
precedeht to the exercise of the rieht to locate a branch Many
moiemigKbesupposed ind doubtless a great many more weuld
be offered    enough have been mentioned to show how un
