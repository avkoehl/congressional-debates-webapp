Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

GENERAL: Colonel Porter will be ready to start at 4 o'clock this p. m. Captain Alexander, General Torbert's quartermaster, has some wagons and horses for the staff to send out, which cannot be ready before morning. Would it be prudent for Colonel Porter to remain until that time?
