Brigadier-General GILLEM,

Bull's Gap:

The enemy are approaching between Loudon and this place. Please relieve Major Smith, my assistance inspector-general, and order him to report here immediately. Had you not better send two pieces of artillery to Strawberry Plains?

DAVIS TILLSON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

LICK CREEK, August 21, 1864.

General TILLSON:

I cannot contend with Wheeler's and Morgan's forces united. One of Morgan's brigades is reported at Blue Springs, four miles in advance of this place. I will attack it to-morrow morning and then move to Rogersville, thus placing myself on Wheeler's left flank, and be governed by circumstances, and, if compelled to do so, fall back on Tazewell and Cumberland Gap. If Wheeler besieges Knoxville I will move down on his rear by Maynardville and annoy him every possible way. Please keep me posted on the enemy's movements. I will move my wagons toward Rogersville to-morrow morning, but will not leave this line until driven from it. Colonel Ingerton attacked Rogersville at daylight this morning. Killed 25; captured 35; among the latter Colonels Heiskell and Walker [Watkins].
