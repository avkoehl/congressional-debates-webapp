single night breaks of ten or fifteen miles which I think would lessen his hold of Atlanta. Also, the position of our inanity would make a cavalry raid from our right flank little hazardous.

General THOMAS:

General Schofield reports that General Kilpatrick did not find the enemy's cavalry at his old camp at Mount Gilead Church; but I don't know where that church is. It is manifest that all the efficient cavalry of the enemy is to our rear. They will tear up all the road beyond Cartersville; but I think Wheeler has been driven off toward Eat Tennessee, and trust that General John E. Smith will return to Cartersville; he has cars enough. There are three regiments and eight guns fat Allatoona and Etowah bridge, and I have ordered General McArthur to send any re- enfocements he can spare, and call on us to replace them at Marietta. I do think our cavalry should now break the Macon road for many miles, we can wit as long as Hood. What say you to letting General Kilpatrick have two of General Garrard's brigades, and then to strike across the Macon road and tear it up good! He has scouted the country now and knows it, and can act with confidence and due caution. General Schofield is well on that flank and makes a good cover. I like the plan better than to send General Garrard up to Cartersville, for the enemy will simply run off, but General Kilpatrick, with two good brigades, can reach across to the Macon road about Rough and Ready, and rear up about six or eight miles by to-morrow night or next day.

General THOMAS:

Until General Garrard is in, General Kilpatrick should remain near Sandtown or General Schofield's flank, in a threatening attitude, to prevent Jackson's cavalry going over took out 6,000 with him I don't believe 4,000 good cavalry remains to the enemy in our front.

General THOMAS:

General Stanley reports General Garrard as back. Has he reported! General Stanley says some cavalry passed to our rear at Cross Keys and killed a picket. Does General Garrard manifest enough activity! Get his report and let me have the substance.
