Brigadier General THOMAS JORDAN,

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of orders, by telegraph, to send the troops of Brigadier-General Evans' brigade to Wilmington, N. C. The order has been executed and the movement will take place as soon as possible. I take the occasion to observe that there is not an infantry soldier left in this command, and the works on Sullivan's Island not being prepared against a surprise the whole position is open to attack and serious chances of capture at any time the enemy desires to make it. It wants a force of good infantry as quickly as possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
