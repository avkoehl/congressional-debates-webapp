HDQRS. 174TH REGIMENT OHIO VOLUNTEER INFANTRY, Fortress Rosecrans, Tenn., December 5, 1864.

MAJOR: In compliance iwht orders received from headquarters Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad, I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by my command at the engagement of Overall's Creek, December 4, 1864:

In obedience to orders from the general commanding, my command formed in line of battle to the right of the Nashville pike, throwing out skirmishers to the front, in the direction of Overall's Creek. I was ordered to remain in this position in support of the artillery on our right. My command thus remained until the advance was ordered across Overall's Creek. I moved my command forward in line of battle to the creek. The skirmishers were immediately thrown across, and the right and left wings were directed to remain in line until the center crossed the formed, and the companies front he right and left wings alternately crossed an formed in their respective places in line of battle. This was done under a severe fire from the enemy. The bridge was torn up, and somewhat impeded our progress, but the movement was executed promptly and in good order. The command was then ordered to move by the left flank until the right would rest on the pike, and then move forward by the right flank, which was done steadily before us until we advanced form one-half to three-quarters of a mile, when we were ordered to withdraw. On receipt of third order we marched back in line "faced to the rear." On reaching the creek we moved by the left flank by file right, recrossed the bridge, and formed line of battle a little in advance of the position we were in when in the support of the artillery at the commencement of the engagement. I left one company at the bridge, one deployed to the left of the bridge, and one at the right of the same, under charge of the major, to protect the recrossing of the cavalry. Remained in this position until ordered to return to murfreesborough.

Any allusion to the conduct of the officers of my command may seem unnecessary,as they fought under the eye of the general commanding. It is due them, however, from me to say their conduct was unexceptionable. My lieutenant-colonel, A. J. Sterling, and major, B. C. G. Reed, also my adjutant, Harry M. Dean, performed their respective duties in the most prompt and gallant manner, and my line officers all behaved so well that it would be invidious to make distinction. It affords me pleasure to be able to say their conduct deserves special commendation. The horses of my lieutenant-colonel, major, and adjutant were wounded, and I had my own horse killed during the engagement.

The following is a list of casualties in my command.*

Number of prisoners captured and sent to the rear, 20. The prisoners were from the Second and Seventh Florida Regiments. From the number of the enemy dead and left on the field over which my com-
