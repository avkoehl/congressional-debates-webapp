JULY 8, 1862.

Brigadier-General WOOD:

Send a regiment of infantry, under a judicious colonel, and one battery of artillery to the river opposite Decatur to-morrow. Let them take a position as near as practicable to the landing, without exposing them to being cut off by artillery playing from the other shore on their line of retreat. The general desires you to go down yourself to see the troops posted. The object is to give support to the companies on the other side at Decatur. I send you a copy of the dispatch which causes this order. It is not designed to

re-enforce Decatur by crossing troops against any formidable attack, and in no case to a greater extent than with a section of artillery and perhaps a few companies of infantry, and this will not be done until the nature of the attack is ascertained. If such a re-enforcement, or about that, should not be sufficient to meet the danger,
