The dash of yesterday evening has alarmed them much. Their train was passing till 1 a.m. this morning. Could you not impede their advance by felling trees in the Chunky bottom? Have not received your letter about offering battle.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

ON ROAD, February 13, 1864-9 a.m.

My command is now in motion for a point 4 miles north of Chunky's Station. The detour above the Decatur and Meridian road would have been too far. The enemy were passing through Decatur about on hour ago. They are having trouble with the roads and bridges.

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General POLK.

FEBRUARY 13, 1864-10 a.m.

GENERAL: I am at a loss as to my moves, not knowing what your intention [is] as to offering battle, &amp;c. I send Dr. Hicks, of my staff, to see you and to rejoin me, and if you think proper you can intrust a message to me by him. My command is much reduced by the recent active service and long marches. The two brigades together do not number 1,400 (Adams' and Starke's.) I think I could do much to annoy enemy on march since my dash yesterday evening as they were much frightened by it. Will endeavor to get above them if possible and between the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, but I fear it is too late.

Yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

Meridian.

CHUNKY'S STATION,

February 13, 1864-6.30 p.m.

GENERAL: I am at this point feeding. Will have to go to Meridian, as there is no road crossing Decatur and Meridian road from this point over Chunky Hills in front of the enemy. Enemy's rear guard was in Decatur at 10 to-day. Shall I come on to-night to get above railroad, or can I attack enemy in flank to-morrow opposite here? All quiet in our rear to Big Black. Ross was at Sharon, near Canton, night of 10th. Forrest reports on the 10th McCulloch met and drove back 1,500 infantry and 300 cavalry from above Senatobia; that four brigades of cavalry were at Collierville to move via Salem and Pontotoc for the purpose of gaining our rear. I do not think there is anything in Major Steede's report.

I am, general, yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Major-General.

Lieutenant-General POLK,

Meridian.
