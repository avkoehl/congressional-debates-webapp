Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

A portion of the Eighth Illinois had a brush with Mosby yesterday near Upperville and whipped him badly, killing seven or eight and capturing nine. The track will be taken up half way between this and Rectortown to-day. They are getting on very slowly; as fast, however, as they possibly can. I go to White Plains this morning.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
