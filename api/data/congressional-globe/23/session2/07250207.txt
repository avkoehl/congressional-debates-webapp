tins discussion, on the contrary, if bo young a I
member of the .Senate as himself might be at lib- I
eay to express ¡>uch an op i ion, it hrd already been
too min.li ex ended     The bid before us was for
the purpo e of changing the organs ttion of the
PostOtfice Department     Its most important pro
\isioot, had leceived the unanimous approbation of
the committee     It was not denied that the enact
men. of this bill was indispensable to the useful
and sui cesbful opeiatiuns of the department     It
corrected  the strange anomaly now existing that
the same hands win h received the public money |
were those which disbursed it,  when it must be I
admttied that there could be no effectual security '
against nbui.es, but by imposing tne duty of re-
ceiving ihe m iney upon one class of offueis, and
that ot paying it out upon another     The main
object was to adopt some measure to correct this
evil      I lie session was rapidly drawing to a close,

He vvas ready to pi ess on an examination of the
principles involved in the bill, but not to a discus

V    GUI  \ I )\ accepted the amendmentas part
of in^ atntndnieiit
Mr BIBB rose to offer an amendment to the
amendment He had come to theconcluston never
to vote one cent from the Treasury to support
the Post Office Department But as these debts
would come in as claims against the Government
for services performed, under proper regulations,
he would consent to the appropriation
Mr  B  then went on to pay a tribute of respect
to the private character of the Postmaster General
He thought the good disposition and kindness of
that officer had been laid hold of by interested and
selfish persons to further their own private inter-
ests, thus abusing the good íessof the Postmaster
General's private feeling by the grossest miposi
tions     Mr   B  concluded by moving an amend
ment providing for the payment of the debts of
the department out of the accruing postaces
Mr SOUTHARD said that the amendment dtd
not obviate his difficulty He stated, yesterday,
that the diffi ulty in Ins mind was in inserting an
appropria ion in a bill organizing the department
H> was in favor of organizing the department
first, and then he would think of making an ao
propnation when he saw where and how the
money was to be paid
Mi   WEBSTER said, a rule of oractical wis-
dom in legislation was, to act for a single object
by a single measuie     The gentlemen from Ien-
nessee, he thought, would have done well to have
made ilus proposition the subject of a distmc  bill   )
The Posi Office Depai tment required a substantial
reorganization, and if mi«managemen*, or what- i
ever else it might be ca'ieJ, existed there, and he !
believed it was not denied, we shouid make pro
vision, fiist, for the re^onstrucion of the depart  I
ment, and, wher that vvas done, introduce-a bill
makingan appropriation fonts relief  Thatseemed
to him the proper course, and if so, why introduce
into this bill a proposition of this extraneous char
icter     What shouid hinder us fiom considering
th s simple question of ieo -ganization ?    The gen-
tleman   fiom    Pennsylvania,   [Vlr    Blciiw^n,]
argued,and wi h gieat propriety, that the amount
of the deb s vvas not pertinent to the question of
the mode of reoiganizatton     And he ihought so
• oo, but he carried the principle further—he
thought that the means of paying those debts were
not so ei'her, they were entnely distinct The
appropriation was a matter to be founded on esti-
mates The gentleme-i on the othei side of the
House desired to provide for those honest men
who vveie creditors of the deiaun°nt, and he fe t
every disposition to join them in this matter But
was theie anything more easy than to get a report
fiom tle depar jnent, with state nents of the
amount of s debts? He hoped the ho^orab'e
gentleman [Vlr Grcndy] woulu no' thus obstiuct
tne progress of the bill, wh ch he knew the sentle
man de ired should pass, by the introduction of
tl is debatable matter Because, if we we-e cal'ed
oi to pav the debts in this way, it opened the
whole question, and must we not inquire what
they were, how they were contracted, and the
true chaiacte' of lli-iii' Sj fai as they could be
discriminated, and shov n to be ¡ust and honea,
he would cheerfid'y \ote a sum sufficient to  pay
.them
Mr GRUNDY sud thet he had but one object
n view, in all tl at he had advanced on this sub
¡•=(,t,and that was, that the departmen' should be
putl He was very anxions thai this bill shm hi
pa's, c ¡.roper amendments were inctirpoiated in
it, and he the-e'bie withdrew the amendment
The 17th sect on (another of Mr Griadt's
amendment') was then taken up It provides
that the books nt the Tietsuiy, so fai as relates
to t íe accoun s of the Geneial Post Office, shall
be kept separate ai d dntu ct fiom all other ac
counts and every wariant tor the payment of
money for demands against the General Post
Oflice shall expiess upon Its fa<e that (he same
vvtii suedonaccountof theGenenlPostOfice
Attei some explanation li im Mi   GRUiSD\,
this stction was amended so as  to require such
wi. rants to  be "signed by the Posimister Gen
eral and  the Commissioner of ihe General Post
Oil e " ifcer which it was agreed to
Phe ISth section, m the following words, was
thet considered
" That the commissioner to be aopo.nted unJc
' the piovisionsof this act, sh ill have povvei to
*  translei debts due horn postulasteis bj üraits m
' favor of contraciors,in discharge of debts due to
« such contractors, for services w,hi<-h may have
' been rendered prior to the time of drawing such
' drafts "                                                          S
After the word "postmaster," the words "who
do not make deposites in bank" were inserted, at
the suggestion of Mr KNIGHT, and the section
as amended was then adopted.
The 19th section was next considered It pro-
vides that the Postmaster General shall report to
Congress within the first ten days of each annual
session, and specifies at length the various sub-
jects upon which he shall report. The section is
divided into four clauses The fourth clause re-
quires the Commissionei to report to the Post-
master Gener I the condition of the finances of
the department.
After bfing so amended, at the suggestion of
Mr WEBSTER, as to require the report of the
Commissioner to be made to Congress, the section
was adopted
The 20th section was next considered, in the
following words
" It shall be the duty of the Postmaster General
• to furnish to the deputy postmaster, at the ter-
' mmation of each route, a schedule specifying the
' times of arrival and departureat his ornee of each
' mail, and also furnish a notice, in like manner,
' of any change or alteration in the arrivals and
' departures which may be ordered by him "
Mi EW1NG moved to insert, after the word
" mad," the words "a copy of which the post-
master shall set up in some conspicuous place in
his ofH e," which, Mr GRUNDY not objecting,
was agreed to, and the section, as amended, was
then adopted
The 21st and last section was then considered
It requires the postmaster at the end of a mail
route, or at any other place where the time shall
be designated at which the mail shall arrive, to
subscnbe an oath "that he will truly and faith-
' fully report to the General Post Office all failures
' to deliver the mail at his office at the times pre-
' scribed " It also directs the Postmaster General
to report to Congress, annually, each fadure to
deliver the mail where the same may be conveyed
in steamboats, coaches, or stage', and the names
of the contractors on whose routes the failures
have occurred
Afer some immaterial amendments of form,
this section was also adopted
[Vlr CLAY heie.on leave,submitted amotion
to reconsider the vote by which the joint resolu-
tion, author zu g the purchase of certain pictures
for the President's House was negatived The
motion being leceived, it was laid on the table ]
The amendments having been gone through
with—
Mr CALHOUN made some objection to the
first sec ion of the bill, which provides for the
appointment of the Commissioner He also
thought the salary ought to be reduced from four
thousand to three thousand five hundred dollars
per annum Mr C submitted an amendment to
be mseitedin lieu of the first section, as follows
" That tne duties now peiformed by the Fifth
' Auditor of the Treasury Department be, and
' the same are hereby, assigned to the Second
' Auditor of the Tieasury, and those now assigned
'to the Second, to the Third Auditor, and that
' the Fifth Auditor shall hereafter be known as
' the Commissioner of the General Post Office, and
'shad peiform the duties heieby assigned, or
' which may hereafter be assigned, to said Com-
' missioner "
After some conversation between Mr CAL-
HOUN and Mr BUCHANAN on the -uiluect,
and before any action vvas had on the proposition,
Mr GRUNDY interposed a motion to adjourn,
which prevailed, and
The Senate adjourned
