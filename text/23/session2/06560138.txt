138                                      THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                         January 19,
disposed to consider their educations.® complete He
thought at least their proficiency in some branches
of science could not be doubted, and notedly in
the modern science of political economy If the
excellence of this science consisted (as he believed
it did) in securing the greatest possible amount of
comfort from the smallest possible share of labor,
all must admit them perfect m this branch at least
He said it was almost amusing to see with what
apparent confidence gentlemen fiom these rich
and independent States would rise and ask for the
charity of the Government His friend and name-
sake from Alabama, he said, rose gravely from his
seatat the last session, without any suffusion in his
countenance that he lecollected, in open day and
open Senate, and gave notice that he would mtro
duce a bill to appropriate, he did not recollect how
much, land in the States of Alabama and Missis-
sippi, for what purpose would anybody guess?
Why, sir, said he, to educate the yovng ladiei
of* these rich and powerful States Why, sir,
said Mr. K , the Senator speaks of educating the
poor in Alabama—there was comparatively none
there. The southwestern States weie blessedly |
inhabited by nabobs and slaves The slaves were
not permitted to receive an education, and their
masters were abundantly able to pay for it If
they would propose to take oui lands for the edu-
cation of the really poor of all the States, if there
were no constitutional objection®, he*wouid seri-
ously think of the proposition, but to tie lavishing
our gifts on the loids of Alabama, was like the
cormorant picking up crumbs from the robin,
they would do him no good, and yet the íobín
might make a meal upon them Just so he said
in this case These two per cents and odd acres
of the Government, were of no consequence to our
rich neighbors, but if properly distubuted, the
benefit of them would be felt He hopod his
friends would not mistake the spirit in which he
ha,d made these remarks, but he wished them to
understand that he was veiy serious in his oppo-
sition to the bill, and when the Senator from Ala-
bama had made a direct apology to the Senate foi
introducing such a bill, he should move to lay it
on the table
Mr WEBSTER said that this fund was a re-
servation for the puipose of making loads, and
this was an application to change the fund, and
apply it to pur-poses of education, and if the State
of Alabama preferred it, he saw no reason why
we should oppose it     Mr  W   then erilaiged on I
the subject of education, and suggested that two i
principles should be  incorporated  in  this bll,
first, that the schools soould be fret, that was, I
without charge, and ne\f, that they should le |
common, so as to obv ate the distinctions ot nch
and pool among the scholars   He, therefore, sug  |
gested an amendment to the bill, that the fund ,
"should be a peimanent fund, to establish  fiee I
common schools," m conformity with his views i
of the subject                                                                 |
Mi POINDEXTER expressed himself atisfied
with the amendment, but tnought if it was adopt
ed, individuals who were able to contribute some
thing for tie support of schools, might peihaps
be prevented fiom doing so                                        I
Mr KING, of Alabama, was ¡n favor of the
amendment suggested  by  the  gentleman liom
Massachusetts, but he was opposed to the bill   I
He doubted the power of Oongies-s to change the
destination of the fund     And the State of Alabi- ¡|
ma was not willing,so far as he vvisuiformed, tl at
it should  be changed      He o1 jected to the  bill,
too,  that it proposed to lepea! the oidnimce by
which Alabama was admitted into the Union    He, I
howevei, Dieferied the amendment which went to |
the establishment of free common scnools, if the I
bill was to pass                                                            ,1
After son e conversation between Messrs EW I
ING, MOORE, and KIJNG, the amendment v/as i1
agreed to                                                                       I
Mi FOlNDEXfER then moved fmther to !
amend the amendment, by strnung out ihe second \¡
section, which repealed the ordinance admitting ||
Alabama into the Union which was agreed to, and ,
the bill was leported to 'he Senate
Mr KANE tnen uiged as an objection to the
bill, that the proposition to reserve the two per
cents was made by Congress to the convention
which formed the Constitution of Alabama, and
the convention accepted it    If this were so, he
considered it a constitutional  provision, which
Alabama could not alter
Mr EW ING replied to this objection, tha' the
proposition was not a part of the constitution of
the State, but was part of the ordinance It was
not, therefore, a matter of fundamental law, and
Congress, with the consent of the State, was per-
fectly competent to change and modify it as they
pleased
After some fmther remarks,
Mr POINDEXTER said that as the other
House had a bid before them which was simnar to
this, he would move to lay the bid on the table,
with a view of seeing what disposition should be
made of that bill
'Ihe motion was agreed to
The bill from the House to authorise the com-
missioner of Indian affVirs at St Louis to employ
a cleik, was lead the first time
Mr POINDEXTER moved to reconsider the
vote of Friday labt,by which the bill for the
relief of William Giaham was mdtfmtely post
poned
Mr BLACK moved to take up the bill mek ng
an appropriation to toe road fiom Lyme creek, in
Alabami, to Chatahoochie, «pposite Columbus,
which was agieed to
Mr BLACK then moved to reconsider the vote
by which the appropriation was requned to be
taken out of the two per cent fund, and the bill
and motion were then laid on the table
HElfiS OF MOSES SHEPPÍ.RD.
Mi C LAY then moved to take up the bill for
the relief of the heirs and legal representatives of
Moses Shepperd, deceased
The bill was supported by Messrs SMITH,
HENDRICKS, LEIGH, and TYLER, and op
posed by Messis HILL, BLACK, and SHEP
LEY
The question being about to be taken, Mi
BLACK moved an adjournment, which was dis
agieed to on a division—yeas 15, nays 17
The question being on ordering the bill to be
engi rjssed for a third reading,
Mr WRIGHT demanded the yeas and nays,
which were oidered, and are as follows

REMOVAL Or THE  IJSDIAiSiS
Mr  IDW4RD EVERE1T said he had been I
requested to pit sent to the House arfemonel f om I
a council of Cherokee Indians, held at Ruining |
Watei, in  the  Cherokee count! y, in  benalf of
those membeis of that tube who v.tie desi ous
of removing  lrum the r piesent loca ion  to the
countiy west of the Mississippi     The memorial
hau been  intrusted to him by a delegation wno
were at this moment in ai'endancem the House
The b gna uies, he underwood, weie attached to
the oi ginal memonal to be mesen ted to the other
bianch of the Legislature, the piesent beingacer
t.fied copv tl ereof    The signatures were fifty   ]
seven in   nnmhei, twenty of them  be ng in  the
hand writ.ng of those whose names they purported
to be, the íeman mg thirty seven being subscribed
in the usual mannei of peisons who v/er~ them- !
selves unable to wute     It was accompan ed by a
certificate setting <btth ti at it was adopted in open I
council, ai d he was satisfactorily informed, that i
I the memorial was the unaided composition of one
of the subscribers, Mr John Ridge, well known
to many members ol the Hou&e as a highly dis-
tinguished individual of the Cherokee tribe By
that gentleman, and two of his associates, Mr E
had been personally requested to piesent the me-
morial He should fuither state, that it was also
accompanied by a series of resolutions adopted at
the same council, expie'sing, in a more precise
and definite foim, the principles set forth, some-
what at large, in the memorial.
Mr E supposed it would be in order, and
indeed it might be expected, that he should auk for
the reading of the memotial and accompanying
resolutions in extenso, but as all the documents
were of considerable length, and woiaid occupy too
much of the time of the House, he would content
himself, in lieu thereof, with bnefly stating their
purpoit and subs'ance The memonahs s setout
by stating then undoubted conviction of their light
to the soil on which they were born, and tnemjuiy
that would bedonetheti by thepoiicy of removing
them theiefiom Now, without in the least degree
going into a discussion on this uub|ect, for his
purpose was very different, he would only say
tha' he felt it due to himself to state, that in this
view he fully concuired with them They then
go on to state the astonishing in piovementsmade
in the arts of civilization in the Cherokee tubes—
improvements, «aid Mr E , known to many
members of ti i¡> House, and to none, Mr Speakei,
bettei than to yourself, and which have excited
the attention of philanthropists both in this coup-
try and in Europe The memorialists then state
their undoubted ai d sorrowful conviction that in
the present state of affairs, it would be impossible
lor them to letain then national existence, or to
cany on tneir piogiess in the arts of civilization
and humanity, and in consequence of this much
to be deplored state of affairs they have been led
to turn their eyes to the West, to the countries
now unoccupied, and they desire—and it is the
object of their memorial to set forth that desire—
that with the aid and undei the protection of the
United States of America they hope to accomplish
that object In considering this subject, the me-
moiiahsts state that there are some interesting
points which, in their opinion, are matteis of
legislation for both Houses of Congress They
wish to be furnished with some means to enable
them to remove with grea'er comfort and conve-
nience, as some compensation for the many and
great sacrifices they must neeessanly make in
giving up and abandoning their lands and ím-
piovements, to be paid to them rot here, I ut on
tneir arrival in the region west of the Mississippi
Thev also think they may reasonably ask foi fur-
ther legislat on on the part of Congress, to ensuie
to them those civil and political pi iv leges which
become the dignity and character of the United
States to gu iranty to them It might be tl ought
that some o*" those obj°cts came more propel!y
wnhm the compass of tne treaty n akmg powe ,
but they had stated, nd Mr E thought conectly,
thai some of those oljects were within the r rov-
ince of Congress They then go on to set forth,
that in the present di^asjious condition of their
na'ion, it was exceedingly doubtful whether any
treaty could be framed Mat would m*>et with the
unanimous oppiobaion of the m<>mb rs of the
uiba  They also dmbt v/hethei, in their present
sttuatioi , p rtieo could be found whom this Giv-
ermrcnt wou'u be d po^ed to recognise in this
Rt!>tc of thi -^s they ha/e thousht the r only re
scurce nnu d be to by tneir real situation before,
i nd to cenfide m tl e justice, the clemency, the
hbeiaM y, and the indulgence of the two Houses
of Cor"ie"s
Mi E regrett'd to find that 'here were a* this
tni  two parties among the Cherokee tribe of
Indians, whose views v ere greatly at vimi ce on
the great pohev to be pursued, but with those
matteis he would not presume to interfere, one
way oi the other He be! eved this was all re
had need to say bv way of settir g foith theorject
and substance of the m mo ial
