APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOB if.

27th Cong ...1st Sess.
Repeal of Independent Treasury—Mr. Shields.
H, of Reps.
The distinctive, essential principles of this sjs-
tem are—
First The separation of ¡he pecunia-y t'anrae
tions of the Government irom the pecuniary tram-
acuons of bank; and individuals
Secondly The recognition and maintenance of
the gold and silver standaid of value, de igned
to be establ>ched and perpetuated by the Consli
tution.
Third Tne protection, by severe penalties and
ample guarantees, of the fund^of the Government
from peculation and embezz'ement
These are the elements of the ^stero,—in their
nature, simple, just, andcons'itutional
Now, Mr, m all candor and sincerity, permit ire
to ask, is there a man upon this fljir who advo-
cates the doctrine that the money ot tbi Gov rn-
ment, ra sed from the taxes levied upon tre peo-
ple, should be used to prov de banks with capital
to bank upon, or mdi/iduals with facilities to trade
upon? Separating th^ subject <iorn the party
topics and assocnt'ons of the das., and guided by
the impartial aictaLs ot con cience ?rd patriotism,
will any man—can any man c mend that the •*">-
Hey of the Government, the proceda o' h  labor
of the people, levied by taxation to defray t1 e ex-
penses ard afford them the pro'ection of Govern
ment, <homd, by sny policy, or under any sys'em,
be involved in the hazards of individual en erpnse
and speculation, or made a fund for bai k loins
and bank is-ue t Will any one aver, af'cr all
that has occurred wuhm our unowl-dgp, tnat the
individual appom ed to take cire ef ihe public mo-
ney should be permitted—nay, encouraged—to
employ it mhis private transactions, or in loans to
others? and, if not individuals, th t banks should
be permit'ed to enj~y a privilege so dangeious, so
uDju«t,  and unconstitutional'
Apart from the ptejud c s of party, whcb, ur-
hippily, 1.0 often influence th° cendue* of men
against then judgments, i do no be leve there are
tho^e here—su"e j arn t¡~at there u no considera-
ble portion of the m1** of the people—who wojM
sanction such a doctrine Ard yet, sir, to deny
to individuals and banks this privilege, and to adopt
the necssary guards f >r the protec'ion of t ie co m-
try from the consequences of its exercise, were
amongst the leading purposes o* the Indepen-
dent Treasury system, and the strongest con-
siderations that contributed to its adoption.
May we not hope that, when the vio-
lence ot party strife -ubsides and reason resumes
its wonted sway over the public mnd, the advan-
ce* cing intelligence ot the age, the increasing power
of truth and justice, will rescue a policy so evi-
dently just, from the prejudice and persecution
which ambition, cupidity, and partisan fanaticism
have engendered against it? To doubt it, wculd
be to doubt the ultima'e triumph of moial virtue
and free institutions
The Pnancial policy of the Government is inti-
mately connected with the currency, or money of
the country, and it is from this connection tha*
the subject derives the very great and Jeep inte
rest with which it seems to be umvrsally regarded
Let us advert, for a moment, to the doctrines of
the Constitution upon this ír'eresting part of the
sub] ct.
The fifth clause of the 8 h sec ion of the In ar-
ticle reads as follows—
"The Congress shall have power i0 com
mone/, reguiaie the value thereof, and of fore gn
coin, and fix the standard of weights and mea
sures."
I was forcioly s*ru"k, a few days since, by the
mterpre «ion pat upon th « c ruse b/ a gent'emai
from V rgtnia, [Mr Bjtts ] m his speech upon
the bill to establisn the Fiscal Bank Fro i it
guage so intelligible, t<-rrns so expl ct, hp deduced
conclusions which, of a'l "abstractions" I have
ever before hearJ or read, seemed to ne to bt
the most absord—the most supremely rid cnlous
1 quote from the remarks made by him, as fol-
low • —
"But I pass on to the fifth clause which fri\ es the poTet o
com money ana re ulatethe va ue t lereof anl of foreign cora
Upon this power I Wish ti dwell a while, and firs!, I drfsir to
call attention to the pecm ar ptua eology of this clause it
its not to stamp coin, and regulate the value theieet but to
com money, and legula.e the value thereof, and of foreign
com'

and purposes,and upon this subject I piopose to introduce some
authority
'In Rees's Encyclopedia, it will be found th-u 'money, in
commerce, is a general tei m for com paper, or any othei mea
sure of value, or representative of property that passes current
from band io hand as a urculdln    medrum
Again 'By real money is un e stood coin or any other
circulating medium Seneca «.bienes, therewas ancientlv
stam led money of leather ' The Holl meters we know,' ays
the same work coined great quantities oí pa tcboaid m tbe

'The Encyclopedia Bntanmca says 'The term money is
used to designate w!m evei commo hty the inhabitants of any
particular connfiy euhei vohmtanly or by comí ulsion accept
as an equivi entioi their labor oi for atl the commodities they

The fi --t clau e o the 10 h sect on of the 1st

the coantry, does it not follow tla* the power to
maintain such a currencv—to enforce the use of
such substances as money—must necessarily re-
sul , ard thtt therefore ihe (government can further
enact that ihe payment of a debt, or atender in
payment of a debt, of such "stamped pieces of
pasteboard or leather," sha'l entitle ihe debtor to a
discharge from his obligation? Can the gentleman
avoid such a conclusion from the premises he has
la d down'? But I will leave him m the labjnnth,
to grope his way out the best he can.
Tie 10 h ai icleof amendments to the Consti-
tuí en reads thus-
1 The powers rot delegated to the United State*, by the Consti
tution nor prohibite 1 by it to t1 e tares, are reserved to the
States reDpective]y, oi to the people '
We have ein that the power >o make any thing

'ebls is expi'ssly w thheld from the States, niris

Federal Government It is not a "necessary and

le^ate-i" power , i is not ucidenial or auxiliary in
its nature o any of those poweis The right ot the

ihe dectar.it on that ail p wer  not grauted to t„at
Govewne it"are íeseí Jed to the Slates respective-
ly , or to the ]>e"ple"—can never be made the subject
of nodule leg station on ihe part of this Government,
consistently with the Constitution.
Toe Slates may make gold and silver a tender
in payment ot deb s, v hen the same is coined into
money uiit'er the authority of ihe Federal Govern-
ment and the valee thereof definitely fixed by such
coinage, or, if in the form ot foreign ctm, by an
aet ot the Government fi>m;r th<? rale of value at
which the same   nail f.-us ar mone}.
B) ni tus, fe j.01 t s cl ihe Federal Govern-
mer are 1 mitcd io su h i eans as are necessary
and pro., e to propel the purity and genuineness of
i com1-, to entourage tnnr re enuon and use in
l \' bas ness of iht countrv, and prevent the sub-
«tiutitncf any other sabs'ance as a standard of
value, oi 'epalty puhorzed medium for ths pay-
ment ot debts
B jt I am told that Consrcs has the power to re-
gulate Use comrrurce, curtency, and exchanges oí
the country, I* is true that Congress has powei,
and is under a constitu lonal obligautn to regulate
the comnerte, bjih fotijn a-<j domestic, of the
cou' tr> , to pa s all lavis ne ssary io the protec-
tion, safety, aiid promotion of that commerce. But
the term* "currency and e^chanets" are nowhere
to be found in the Constitutu n, nor are there any
de egitions oí auihori y íespectirg the same, except
such as have already been alluded to. The idea of
the power of the Government "to regulate the cur-
rency" is so prevalent throughout the country, that
I have oiten rae,, with centlemen, otherwise well-
in oimcd, wno were really o opinion that the Con-
st *ution cosiii'd a dis'mct clau e, in so many
wmds, conferring upon the Government power "to
regula e the "u-reiíCv " But, sir the word "car-
ren"y" i a te m unknown o !h Cunsli ution— n
exit c terai not found m an> clauee or part of that
instrument The pettier to .regulate a "pasteboard"
currency, or a "Wthei" currency, or a "papei"
cur ency, is equally for isn to tint instrument.
