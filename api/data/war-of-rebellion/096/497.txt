CAPTAIN: I sent out last night a party of seventy-five men, under command of Captain Howe, of the First Virginia, to the neighborhood bordering on the Shenandoah, between Castleman's Ferry and Shepherd's Mill, returning by way of Salme Church. They bring in as prisoners one Confederate captain (Marchall) and seven men, who are forwarded to headquarters cavalry, through provost-marshal.
