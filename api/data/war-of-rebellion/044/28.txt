At midnight, having obtained, as I conceived, important information, I telegraphed Major -General Halleck as follows:

Headquarters,

Maryland Heights, June 24, 1863-2 a. m.

Major -General Halleck, Commander -in -Chief.

Have just captured some cavalry near Centerville, or Keedysville, as it is called here, and one of General Lee's couriers, who left him at Berryville last evening at 6 o'clock, with orders for General Ewell, who is at Hagerstown. He says he delivered the orders to another courier, who took them to Ewell. He says Longstreet's corps is with Lee, at Berryville, this side of Winchester.

Dan. Tyler,

Brigadier-General. June 24. -

Ordered a cavalry scout to be a sent at 3 a. m. toward Sharpsburg, to observe the rebel movements toward Hagerstown and Boonsborough. The weather to-day is clear, and at 9 o'clock received the following from the signal station:

Headquarters, Maryland Heights, June 24, 1863. - 9, 30 a. m.

Major -General Halleck, Commander -in-Chief:

The following is just received from the signal station:"The wagon train that was near Shepherdstown last night is now crossing the river near Sharpsburg. A large train, extending as far as I can see on the Berryville road, is passing through Charlestown toward Shepherdstown. I see artillery with it. "I am satisfied that this is Longstreet's corps, and that it is following Ewell. I am also satisfied that General Lee was at Berryville yesterday afternoon at 4 o'clock.

Dan. Tyler,

Brigadier-General.

At 2 o'clock, I telegraphed Major -General Halleck as follows:

HEADQUATRES, Maryland Heights, June 24, 1863-2 p. m.

Major -General Halleck, Commander-in -Chief:

A careful examination of 7 men, 1 of them a courier from General Lee to General Ewell, captured last night, seems to establish clearly as follows: 1. That Ewell's entire corps had passed forward toward Hagerstown. 2. That Lee was at Berryville on Monday at noon, with Longstreets corps, following the march of Ewell's corp. 3. That Hill's corps is at Fredericksburg. Lee left Fredericksburg June 6, and reached Longstreet; s corps, at Berryville, the 18th, and was there when the courier left on Monday, 22d. Longstreets corps is represented to have 30, 000 men and thirty guns, two or three drawn by 10 horses. Lee passed from Fredericksburg by Culpeper (where he remained five days), by Aldie through Ashby's Gap, and thence to Berryville, 8 miles.

Dan. Tyler,

Brigadier-General.

At 8 p. m. telegraphed Major -General Schenck as follows:

Headquarters,

Maryland Heights, June 24, 1863-8 p. m.

Major-General Schenck, Commanding Eight Army Corps:

We have captured some officers and men to-day. The rebels are moving on Hagerstown in large force. Ewell's and Longstreet's corps have passed the ford at Shepherdstown, and taken the route by Boonsborough to Hagerstown. Ewell has passed beyond Hagerstown, toward Chambesburg.

Dan. Tyler,
