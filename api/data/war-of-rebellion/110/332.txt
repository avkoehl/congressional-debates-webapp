JEFFERSON DAVIS,

President, Richmond, Va.:

The Federals are sweeping this country of its negroes. They have, with bodies of armed men, driven off nearly all the negroes in Arkansas. Phillips County they have neither work stock, corn, nor meat, and rob and plunder the houses. They shoot the negroes attempting to escape, and handcuff and chain those refusing to go. They have driven off all I had- men, women, and children- nealy 400 in number. Can no retaliatory measures be adopted!
