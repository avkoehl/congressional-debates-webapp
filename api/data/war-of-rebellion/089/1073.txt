Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Six deserters from Mahone's old and Harris' brigades, of Mahone's division, have just been forwarded. They came in on General Miles' front, Second Army Corps, this a.m. One of them states that two divisions of infantry went to Weldon day before yesterday; heard it talked about in camp; said to be Early's divisions, one from Burgess' Mill and the other from Station; no further particulars; understood in rebel army yesterday that Sherman had taken Savannah and was marching on Charleston; had destroyed the Charleston and Savannah Railroad in four places.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.

CITY POINT, December 25, 1864.

J. C. BABCOCK:

Agent coming from Richmond yesterday was obliged to destroy a written communication on being halted be rebel scouts. He remembers the information very indistinctly, which was to the effect that the troops ordered south had gone according to the programme before communicated. These included Hoke's division, and were in number from 8,000 to 10,000. Troops had been sent to Gordonsville, and agent thinks Hunton's brigade went as a part or whole of them. Yesterday's Richmond papers admit the occupation of Gordonsville; say that communication with Savannah is broken, and have nothing from Wilmington. What news do you get?

SHARPE,

Colonel.
