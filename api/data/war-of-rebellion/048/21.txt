HEADQUARTERS FIRST CORPS,August 4, 1863.

GENERAL: General Buford was attacked this p. m. by a brigade of cavalry and six guns (Whitworth and 12-pounder). Enemy were driven from the first, being pressed so hard as to prevent their forming. Buford has established his pickets 800 yards in advance of where they were this morning. Did not push his advantage, although he could have done so but thought nothing was to be gained by it. Some picket firing yet (dark), but no apprehensions of an attack. All quiet now, 8.20.
