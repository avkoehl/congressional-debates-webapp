HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA, March 8, 1865.

Brigadier-General MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Cumberland, Md.:

At the instance of Captain Du Pont, chief of artillery, the First Ohio Battery has been ordered to be dismounted and turn over their horses to the First Pennsylvania Battery. I have just received the following from General Seward:

The First Pennsylvania Battery, which has arrived here to relieve First Ohio, are entirely recruits; have but one officer, who will be mustered out in ten days. Is it not possible to have the order revoked, allowing the First Ohio Battery to retain their guns and remain? They are well drilled and familiar with the country, while the new men, so far as service is concerned, are worthless at this point.

W. H. SEWARD,

Major Merriam, chief of artillery for the division, says the First Pennsylvania are of but little account. They have been under his command for a long time, and his standing as an officer entitles his judgment to much weight. I think Captain Du Pont made a mistake in designating First Pennsylvania Battery to relieve First Ohio. I should like the order to be suspended until the matter can be investigated.

Respectfully,

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General

CUMBERLAND, March 8, 1865

Brigadier-General SEWARD,

Martinsburg:

Mosby crossed Shennadoah to-day with 300 men, crossing at Snicker's Ferry. Reno thinks he went to White Post. I thought I would advise you to be on lookout for a raid.

Brigadier-General.
