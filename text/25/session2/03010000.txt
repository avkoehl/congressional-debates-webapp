[Continued from No. 17 ]
day, for the reasons he had then give    If, how-
ever, the committee saw proper to disagree to it,
he had nothing farther to say
Mr DOWNING said he knew of $500,000,
which were ready to be presented, but which had
not been presented, merely because it was known
the Treasury had not the money to pay them, until
the appropriation was made He trusted, if the
gentleman expected his amendment to pass, that
he would so modify it, as to provide a sum suffi-
cient to pay all these claims He hoped no amend-
ment would be made which would not meet the
claims, and which would give the department a
discretion to make discriminations, which must, at
all times be odious
The amendment was then disagreed to
Mr CAMBRELENG then moved an amend
ment f r contingencies ef the ai my $5,000, which
was agreed to.
Mr C moved further to amend the bill, by
adding a clause for the settlement ot the claim of
the heirs of William Melldiom, $268, which was
agreed to
Mr C moved a further item, paying \dam
Eckfelt for preparing gold medals for certain offi-
cer* of the army and navy,
After a few remarks by Messrs CAMBRE-
LENG, SERGEANT, and RICE GARLAND,
the amendment was agreed to
Mr LEGARE saw that the appropriation for
arming fortifications had been reduced from two to
one hundred thousand doll-vis He begged leave
to inquire of the chairman ot the Commutes of
Ways and Means on what grounds these reductions
had been made by the committee
Mr CAMBRELENG explained that heietofore
the appropriation for arming fortifications had been
§100,000, but, in consequence of the state ot the
country, and of the Treasury, at the last session, it
was deemed proper to increase this appropriation to
$200,000. The committee, however, considering
the present embarrassed state of the Treasu y, and
knowing that theie was a large balance ot the old
appropriation, they had considered it expedient and
proper that this reduction in the appropriation ought
to be made £ urthermore, he did not belie*.e that
more could be expended advantageously to this
purpose.
The bill was then laid aside, to be reported to the
House
NAVY BILL
The committee then took up the bill miking ap-
propriations for the support of the na" y for the year
1838
The bill being lead througi,
Mr CAMBRELENG stated, for the information
of the House, that the appropriation proposed to be
made by this bill, was much less than that made at
the last session of Congress, and went into scleral
statements, showing m what particular items the
appropriations had been reduced
Mr McKAY then inquired of the chairman
of the Committee of Waj s and Means, whethei
the first appropriation in the bill provided
for any new navy officers2 He thought there
were now too many midshipmen in our
navy, their number now being about four hun-
dred and fifty, and he believed tinte hundred to
be ample ior all the exigem íes of the sen ice
There was no limitation upon the Secretary as to
the number to be appointed, ind the only control
the House had over the subject, was b> the appro-
priation for the purpose He trusted, t! erefoie,
that this clause provided for no new officers
Mr CAMBRELENG explained m answer to the
gentleman from North Carolina, that the appropri-
ation for this purpose was made in pursuance of die
estimates of the department of Not ember last,
which were in the ordinary form These estimates
were not so large as they were the previous year,
which was in consequence of the surplus arising
from the unexpended balances of appropriation   It
might be possible that it would enable the Secreta-
ry to apply a portion of it to the payment of new
officers, but if so it must be to a very limited extent,
because the appropriation was less than it was the
preceding year
Mr. CAMBRELENG offered to amend the bill,
by adding a clause for fixtures and other expenses
of the Naval Asylum at Philadelphia, #1,200,
which was agreed to.
There being no further amendment proposed, the
bill was laid aside
RED RIVER RAFT.
On motion of Mr POPE, the committee then
took up the bill from the Senate, making an appro-
priation of $70,000 for the removal of the Red
river raft
There being no proposition to amend the bill, it
was laid aside to be reported to the House.
CUMBERLAND ROAD BILL
On motion of Mr MASON of Ohio, thecommit-
mittee took up the bill making appropriations (or
the continuation of the Cumberland road in Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois
Mr M moved an amendment providing a
change in the mode of superintendence of ihe
road, but subsequently withdrew the motion
Mi McKENNAN, in pursumce of the mstruc
tion of the Committee of Roads and Canals, moved
an amendment to provide for the erection of guard
fences on the road east of the Ohio, and tor widen-
ing the same at Laurel Hill, and for the payment
of the expense incurred in the erection ot toll-
house"! on said road
After a few remarks l>v Messrs POPE, Mc-
KENNAN, MERCER, and McCOY, the quest on
was taken, and the amendment agreed to—ajes
72, noes 50
Mi CAMBRELENG then moved that tne com-
mittee rise,and report these four bills to the House
Mr MALLORY expressed a n ish to have the
naval bill so amended as to have some informa-
tion about the exploring expedition
Mr MONTGOMERY should oppose th  bill
on the ground that it did embrace this appropria-
tion, for though as warm a trie id to ihe navy is
anj man m the countrj,he was opposed to this
whole scheme, and in the House he shou d move
to recommit the bill to the Committee of Waj 
and Means, for the puipose of unking this ippro-
pnation specific
Mr CAMBRELENG should be as glad as the
gentlemen, if they could call back into the Trea-
surj the many hundred thousand dolhrs already
expended ior this prolific exploring expedition , but,
as they could not so act retrospectively, it would
be better now to go on with it, and as they had
the officers to support, it would be better to send
them to the south pole for discipline than to the
Mediterranean Mr C was not an advocate for
the expedition originally, but thought, on a more
moderate scale, it hid better now proceed
Mr INGHAM referred the gentleman from
Virginia to some documents from the Niiy De-
partment on this subject, which contained a'l the
information that w as probably required, and asked
gentlemen to suspend thpir judgment till thej had
read those communications
After some further remarks from Messrs MAL
LORY and REED, the Committee lose and re-
ported the above four bills to the House
The House then took up the bill making appro
pnations foi the support of the army, for the je-r
1838, and the amendments of the Committee ot
the  Whole, with two except ons, which will be
noticed, were concurred in
The House then took up the amendment, mak-
ing a redaction for national armories, from
¿,360,000 to §340,000, and it was non concurred
Ihe amendment of the Committee of ihe Whole,
reducing the appropriation for arsenals, was con-
curred m
Mr BELL moved to reduce the appropriation
for national armories from $360,000 to 260,000,
and urged it upon the House, because of the pre-
sent condition of the country and the National
Treasury It seemed to h>m the true policy would
be to merely make an appropriation for keeping
the building and machinery in order, which would
enable us At any time to put them into active ope-
ration We had already expended about seven
mi'lions of dollars in carrying on these armories,
besides the four millions which had been paid to
private establishments for arms for the States.
Mr MASON of Vnginia opposed the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Tennessee to reduce
this appropriation, and contended that the true
policy of the Government was to keep up these
establishments, and make such appropriations for
their support as would enable the Government to
discontinue the practice of making purchases of
small arris from private establishments
Mr CALHOUN of Massachusetts hoped there
would be no reduct on in this appropmtion, be-
cause, if it was reduced it would tend to the de
struotion of one of the most beautiful systems of
manufacturing which was cirned on in this coun-
try We already once attempted the reduction of
the appiopnations for these establishments, and
had seen the evil tendency of it, and he hoped the
House would not again adopt this ruinous policy
He considered it a moat mistaken policy to stop
the operations of these establishments, after the
most eminent skill had been found to exist in them,
and he trusted the Government would not pursue
any such course, because if the skill which was there
concentrated was scattered abre ad, it would be
w ith greit difficulty that it could again be brought
to bear, when peihips it might be most needed
Af'ei i few remarks oy Mr BELL, the amend-
ment w is disagreed to
The bill was then, after having been ordered to
bs engrossed, read a third time and passed
The House then took up the bill making appro-
priations for the support of the navy, and the
amendments of the Committee of the Whole were
concurred in
The CHAJR then announced the question to be
on the engrossment of the bill
EXPLORING EXPEDITION
Mr MONTGOMERY hoped the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means would not
press the question on the engrossment of the bill
at the present time, as there were some items in it,
in relation to which he [Mr M ] felt considerable
doubts He was desirous of voting for the bill,
and for all appropriations which might be necessary
to carry on the ordinary operations ol the navy ,
but he a usted that this House, after the decision it
had made a few das s since, would not pass an ag-
gregate appropriation of the people's money of a very
large amount, which was to be expended in sending
an expedition to Symmes's cj lindncal world He
was opposed to mal nig an appropriation for the Ex-
ploring Expedition before we had the necessary in-
formation fr< m the department on the subject, which
would be laid upon our tables in a few days, and
he trusted the gentleman would permit this bill to
he over " ithout having any further action taken
upon it, until the information to which he referred
was received
Mr WISE thought the gentleman's objection to
his bi 1, on account of this appropnation for the
South Sea Expedition wps not well founded Un-
der all the circumstances, he thought this appro-
priiticn ought to be made, although he was, not
in f-norof stud ng out this expedition into any
iVtant seis Mr W then ja«e notice to the gen-
tleman from North Carolina and to the House,
that on Monday next, when resolutions would be
in order, that he intended moving a resolution for
the purpose of converting this Exploring Expedition
into a coast squadron, for surveying our own,
coasts, and protecting our vessels upon them It
has been demonstrated during the last year that
such a squadron was essentially necessarj, for
although it turned out that no piney took plaoe
on the Capes of the Delaware, jet it vis for some
time seriously apprehended that one of your; ¡fbila,-
