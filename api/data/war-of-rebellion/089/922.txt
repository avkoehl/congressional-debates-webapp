HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 10, 1864-1.50 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Benham can be moved by rail and landed at Meade's Station, from whence he can report to General Parke.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 10, 1864-2.10 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I sent to General Shepley, at Norfolk, to know if he has heard from Warren and to try and communicate with him. I have also notified Shepley that it is barely possible Warren may be forced to make into Suffolk, and, if so, he will want rations and forage immediately. Has your provost-marshal got a scout who by working eastward might reach Warren? If so, send him orders to avoid danger by going to Suffolk if necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 10, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Do the enemy keep such a force between you and Warren as to prevent your cavalry from pushing out to see and learn the movements of the enemy and our own troops?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 10, 1864-3 p.m. (Sent 3.35 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I will send a scout with General Potter, commanding troops sent to Warren's support, who will leave Potter at the Nottoway, and try to make his way to Warren. In the meantime Sharpe, from City Point, and Shepley, from Norfolk, might send one if they can from Suffolk. Warren was directed to return by way of Jerusalem, which is on the road from Hicksford to Suffolk. If he takes that route it will be risky for Potter to go too far from here. I have just received your dispatch of 3 p.m. I do not know what there is between Warren and this army. The road to the crossing of the Nottoway was open on the day after Warren left, when a squadron of cavalry returned with his stragglers. The handful of cavalry I have been on the extreme left, and are now returning, and will be sent with General Potter and pushed in advance to obtain information, by which his movements will be guided.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
