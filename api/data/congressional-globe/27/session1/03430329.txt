In su-a   a  ca^e,    he   would    ask  the S na'or

the gift of five hundred thousand a^res to each

Ci-eds of ihe remamiB^ load-, were to be deducted
for their benerl, and they would af'erward-. receive,

the estimate which had be ii made on both sides if
tt>e Senate, the nett aimual proceeds of these lands
would, for sometime, amount to about three mil-
Inns of dollars. Three hundred thousand dollars
of this fund, or nearly that amount, was fir t to be
granted as a grati'ity to the new Slater, ?n 1 by
this grant the share of Pennsylvania would be re-
duced from three hundred to t#o hundied and
«eíenty thousand dollar-, per annum. Itws not
for Dim to say whether this would bs just or un-
just. It was sufficient fer him to know ihat it was
not in ac< oidanee wi h the infraction  of those to
whom he ce'd Inm^elf ro'sponsib'e
Seould he vote for the bill in i's present form,
how could he defend himself hereafter? Suppose

the bill wis,, s it cer'amly wou'd b", unpoiu'a1',
should chfrge him wi,h havm" \ioia'ed his in-

it, what answer could he make to such achnrge'!
How could he jiií'ify such a vote to his political

a few days ago, and a^sured him, (Mr B ) tha* h-

supplied?   By a tax of twenty pe>- cent, upon cof-
fee and tea—articles which tae habi's of the peo-
1
pie of Pennsylvania had rendered necessmes of **
life, and which entered largely into the consump-
tion of evry tam.ly, poor or "rich. While this bill
thus taxe I coffe and lea, if left railroad iron im-
ported fo- thp Use of corporations free of dusy, and
yet, s'range as it might seem, a Pennsylvania Se-
tor wa> asked to violate the express language of
his instructions, and vote for the land bill, which
it was avowed, would render this olious tax bill
absolutely necesswy. The annual distribution
under (he land bill wouid be equal to but a little
more than an eleven penny bit to eachmdividualm
Pennsylvania; whilst the tax to winch each of ifeem
would be subj«eted,m ecnseqjeic of i,s p ssage,
on the articles of ci.fíee and tea alone, must consi-
derab'y exceed that amount. This truly was wise
legislation '
E en if it were possible that the Legislature
could have mistaken th-ir own meaning m these
ui'tructions, he vas glad that the time nould saoa
arrive when they might correct this m'stake, if the
b 11 should not become a law a' the present session.
This bi'l would not m any event go m'o cperation

that month they might instruct him to vote for it:
and 'n this they should be obe; ed
This special se^s.on ha 1 n >t been anticipated;
and at fheOe'ober election, the people would have
an opportum'y of expressing totir op.nion on these
two <neasurcs, which were, from the pnseni con-
dition of the Treasury, inseparable—ne msant the

The Senator thought that h s colleague [Mr.
Sturgeon] uoüd obta'n but fetv votes for his
amenimcKt aad this w*s very piobable. The
Whig Senators would doubtless all vote against it,
v h ther f'om th  new States or th oil. The De-
rmcra'ic Sena ors from the new S Mes would all
vce i pm t it, because ii would reduce their divi-
sion ef he m mev to bo distribu ed under this bill,
to ibe o>"oporticn to which they were entoled by
t e r po"uU'un under the la'e c ns"s He pre-
inmfrf, however, that every DpiToe''a ic Senator
from tbe oíd S ates would vote in favor of an
amendment which would sacare to their constitu-
ents a fair, and no m"re than a fair proportion of
the pro -eeds of th se lands.
Mr CAXHOUNsaidhe would not have risen,
but for vdnt he thought the rather tsnkmd remark
e>f the Senator from Pennsylvania.
Mi BUCHANAN.   What remark?
Mr CALHOUN.   The renuik fat the bill to
dispose of the public lands to the S'ates in which
th y he was more objectionable dial th; measure
now before the Sen?te.
Mr. BUCH iiNAN    That is my opionion.
M^ CALHOUN.   My opmun is  directly the
reverse, and I will be prepared  to demonstrate at
the proper time, that the Senator is entiiely mis-
taken
