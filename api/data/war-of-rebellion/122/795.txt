fifths of it. The whole of it was actively and usefully employed in the field and in garrison until discharged or remustered in the three-years' service.

In June, 1861, the Government of the United States sent to the arsenal for distribution among the loyal inhabitants of Missouri 10,000 stand of arms and sets of accouterments. These were placed in the hands of the so-called Home Guards in different parts of the State. No accurate account can be given of the Home Guards. To the great majority of them these arms and accouterments were given for the purpose of enabling them to protect their own homes and neighborhood. They expected neither pay nor subsistence from the Government, and made no reports to its authorities. They have been of great service to the State and to the Union cause, and have exhibited much gallantry when brought in contact with the enemy. Besides those armed by the United States, there were probably enough more in the Home Guard organization who furnished their own arms to make the whole number in the State upward of 15,000. There was a class of Home Guards, however, which should properly be considered a part of our volunteer force. These troops were raised under the following circumstances: For a long time Missouri was not permitted to place in the summer the State was limited as to the number of regiments that would be accepted, and there was no authority to accept cavalry or artillery. Brigadier-General Lyon, then in charge of this department, desiring to make his entire volunteer force available, enrolled some battalions and companies of Home Guards for three-months' service and placed them in charge of a part of our lines of communication. These troops were ordered upon duty as soon as organized, and were kept in active service constantly until their time of enlistment expired. A complete list of them cannot be given. The following is an approximate estimate of their number:

Potosi Home Guards.......................................... 50

De Soto Home Guards......................................... 102

Carondelet Home Guards...................................... 103

Inks' battalion............................................. 350

Owens' battalion............................................ 400

Hundhausen's battalion...................................... 400

Saint Charles battalion..................................... 300

Jefferson City battalion.................................... 200

Hannibal battalion.......................................... 304

Total.......................................................2,209

These troops, although they were necessarily stationed where they were most exposed to the malarious fevers of the country during the summer and fall without adequate supplies, and although in faithfully performing an important duty they have been more than decimated by diseases, are yet unrecognized and unpaid by the Government. As soon as the President's proclamation calling for volunteers to serve for three years, or during the war, was issued the organizations of regiments in accordance therewith was commenced. The result is shown in the detailed statement hereto appended and marked Schedule A. The recapitulation shows that of Missouri Volunteers serving for three years, or the war, we have 23,847 infantry, 3,055 artillery, and 5,919 cavalry, making an aggregate of 32,821.

The militia organized under the call of Your Excellency for six- months' service number 6, 185, as appears by the report hereto appended and marked Schedule B. The reorganization of the militia for service during the war commenced so recently that no further report in regard
