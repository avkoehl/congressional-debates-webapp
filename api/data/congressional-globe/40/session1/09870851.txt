PRINTING OP THE RULES.
Mr. ANTHONY. I offer the following res-
olution, and ask for its present consideration:
Resolved, That the resolution of the 6th instant,
directing the printing of five hundred copies of the
rules of the Senate with the Constitution and Man-
ual, be, and the same is hereby, rescinded, and that
there be printed two hundred and fifty copies of the
rules for the use of the Senate.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. POMEROY. I suggest, if the rules
are to be-in any way amended or changed,
whether that ought not to be done before we
make an order to print them.
Mr. ANTHONY. That is the object of the
resolution. There was a resolution passed on
the 6th instant ordering the printing cf an
edition of the Rules and Manual. This reso-
lution rescinds that, strikes out the Manual
altogether, and reduces the number of copies
of the rules to be printed to two hundred and
fifty. There are none now extant. It is thought
so important a matter as revising the rules of
the Senate would hardly be concluded and
agreed upon by the Senate until some time in
the course of the next session, and it would be
very desirable to have some copies of the rules,
especially when considering the report that
may be brought in as to the old rules. This
reduces the number and strikes out the Manual.
llr. POMEROY. I supposed every Senator
had one copy of the rules at least.
Mr. ANTHONY. I think not. There are
no copies of the rules as they are now, because
they have been amended in very important
respects since the last edition was printed.
Mr. POMEROY. I have no objection to
printing two hundred and fifty of them.
The resolution was adopted.
REPORT ON INDIAN TRIBES.
Mr. HENDERSON. I offer the following
resolution:
1Resolved, That there be printed for the use of the
Senate two thousand additional copies of the report
of the Secretary of the Interior in response to the
resolution of the Senate asking information in refei-
ence to the several Indian tribes of the United States,
and that there be printed for the use of the said De-
partment five hundred extra copies thereof.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. This reso-
lution, under the rule, goes to the -Committee
on Printing.

ted States aie bound by neighborhood and republican

inoro urgent from the present condition of affairs.
where each party is embittered by protracted con-

case Maximilian shall at an early day see fit to
abdicate bis authority in Mcxieo, and shall signify

Mr. JOHNSON submitted the following
resolutions; which were ordered to lie on the
table, and be printed :
Whereas during the civil war in Mexico the Gov-
ernment of the United States, acting in pursuance
of its Ions and firmly established policy, has retused
â– in any way to acknowledge the imperial govern-
ment, of which the Archduke Maximilian was the
head, but, on tho contrary, continued to recognize
the republican government of that country as the
only legitimate government, and by this conduct has
done much to frustrate the attempt of Maximilian
and his supporters to overthrow such government,
it is the opinion of the Senate that tlie Government
of the United States should adopt every proper
measure to avert the unnecessary further effusion
of blood, and to restore at the earliest moment peace
to that now distracted land ; Therefore,
Resolved by the Senate of the United States, That the
President be, and he is hereby, requested to offer to
the contending parties the friendly mediation of tho
United States, so as to bring the civil war to a termi-
nation on terms honorable to both, and to secure to
the native followers of Maximilian, and all foreign
citizens and subjects residing in that country, tho
benefit of the laws of civilizcd warfare: it being un-
derstood, however, that such mediation is tendered
with tho understanding that Maximilian shall abdi-
cate his assumed authority, and that he and his for-
eign troops shall leave the country at the earliest
practicable day.

of these resolutions to the President of the United
