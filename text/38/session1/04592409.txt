and the payment of bills when they are presented. What-
ever of financial sagacityj whatever of trained mercantile
skill the laws or the polte^of the Department expect to
find and to use in the efforts .of the Navy agent in making
bargains for supplies, it Is confessedly evident that neither
the one nor the other have been called into practical service.
" What would be thought of the skill or prudence of a
merchant who on one day would receive varnish at the
rate of one dollar per gallon, under contract, costing and
worth but eighty cents per gallon, and who would on the
same day receive, from the same parties, the same quality
of varnish, and pay for it $3 50 per gallon ? Yet such in-
stances are of frequent occurrence in the history of the
transactions of the Brooklyn navy-yard. You will under-
stand that I state no fictitious cases, but only such as I
have examined, and the very fact that such cases have
happened presents to my judgment the most convincing
proof of the evils and imperfections of the present system.
The responsibilities and duties of inspection are divided
among so many persons, and there is such a wide discrep-
ancy between the duties that by law and regulation are de-
volved upon the Navy agent, and the iabor the Navy agent

official duty entertained by the Navy agent."
****** *****
" The statement I have made is not as complete as I would
wish it to be, but you may trust that there is nothing in it *
unreliable. I have confined myseif to a statement of the
practice prevailing rather than to particular illustrations."
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Morgait
fn the chair.) The hour having arrived for the
consideration of the special order, it becomes the
duty of the Chair to call up the unfinished busi-
ness of Saturday.
Mr. FOOT. I suggest, and I presume it will
meet the unanimous concurrence of the Senate,
that the special order be passed over for the time
being, until the Senator from Iowa shall have con-
cluded his remarks. It is a courtesy that is al-
ways extended by the-Senate.
Mr. HALE. I know it is; but I shall ask the
same courtesy, to be allowed to reply to him.
Mr. HOWARD. Let the special order be
passed over informally.
The Presiding officer. That will be
considered the sense of the Senate, if there be no
objection. ,
Mr. GRIMES. Need I remind the Senate that
the system of which Mr. Wilson thus speaks
is the same system which the Senate Committee
on Naval Affairs declares "has been in opera-
tion" " more than half a century, and in the opin-
ion of your committee has operated well, and is
well calculated to effect the object sought to be
attained, namely, supplying the Navy at reason-
able prices with the best articles demanded for
the public service?'*
Any one can see by reference to the last report
of the Secretary of the Navy, page 996, that quite
as great frauds can be perpetrated now as before
fictitious bidding was abolished. The case to
which 1 refer by way of illustration, for I have no
time to do more than to refer to one case, is the
contract of J. L. Savage, of date April 7, 1863,
and under advertisement of February 12, 1863,
for miscellaneous engineers5 tools. The items
were:
Market value.
3 anvils, each  #50 00 £30 00
2,000 pounds cotton waste at,... 80 40
18 chopping handled axerf, each, 3 00 1 25
12small axes, each..  1 50 75
Gcalhperss, each   2 00 50
6 dividers, each ' 2 00 75
4 grindstones, each  30 00 4 5Q
6 hjdraulic jacks, each  290 00 140 00
4 scale beams, each  50 00 6 50
12 sieves, faoh  5 00 1 50
50 scoop shovels, each  2 00 1 00
G steel squares, each  2 00 80
6 iron squares, each  1 50 40
4 dozen monkey wrenches  150 00 20 00
Yet Savage was the lowest bidder for this class.
H'is bid amounted to $4,689. The other bidders
were H. D. Stover, $5,039, and, H. J. Collins &
Co., J4,700;all, doubtless, confederates to defiaud
the Treasury. Suppose all their bids had been re-
jected . Then, doubtless, one of them would have
been selected to make an open purchase of the
same articles, and we would have had a reenact-
ment of the'open-purchase transactions of C. W.
Scofield & Co. in New York. Still, I have no
hesitation in saying that the Bareau of Engineer-
ing ought to have at once rejected ail the bids in
this case, whether with or without law, even at
the risk of being consigned to the tender mercies
of a Navy agent and the open puichases of Sco-
field, Savage, or Stover. The only excuse for
not doing so is to be found either in the immediate
and pressing necessity for the articles contracted
for, orin the fact that in the hurry and multipli-
cation of business the attempt by the confederates
to defraud the Government was not detected by
the officers having the subject in charge.
Mr. President, we are told that the system un-
der which such transactions as this are possible
"is well calculated to effect the object sought to
be attained, namely, supplying the Navy at rea-
sonable prices with the best articles demanded for
the public service!"
Another device resorted to by nearly all of the
contractors during the past year has been the
false verification or summing up of the totals of
class bids. This has been done in the expecta-
tion that m the hurry of opening five hundred or
a thousand bids at one sitting, and the immediate
award of the contracts, the aggregates set down
by the contractors would be accepted as correct.
