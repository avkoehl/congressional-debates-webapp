schooner Highlander, and are doubtless with you by this time. The signal party which returned here on the morning of the 1st instant with disabled transportation left the same evening in the steamer America, and the necessity for the additional signal party requested by Colonel Myer does not therefore exist. I have nothing additional to communicate by this opportunity, except to say that the commanding general desires to be informed of your wants of subsistence stores, in order that timely preparation may be made for a full supply.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
