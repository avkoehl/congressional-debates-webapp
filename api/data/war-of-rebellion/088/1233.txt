HEADQUARTERS ARMIES CONFEDERATE STATES, Richmond, September 5, 1864.

Respectfully submitted to honorable Secretary of War.

The arrangement suggested by General Lee will no doubt conduce to the efficiency of the troops. I have not found that officers could, as a general rule, be advantageously employed near their homes, especially where they had been previously associated with political organizations.

HEADQUARTERS, September 3, 1864.

General HAMPTON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: From the reports of your scouts I judge that the enemy is very open to attack at City Point and other points where his wagons are parked in his rear. I wish you would have the matter closely inquired into and the roads and distances you would have to him. It also is probable from the movement of all his cavalry from his rear to his front, that he is meditating some attack or expedition to our right. I hope you will be prepared for this. Keep your cavalry as much to-
