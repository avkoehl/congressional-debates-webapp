Hke manner condemned, if it is to be assumed that
what we have wisely done, under all the circum-
stances of the case, may form a precedent for
others to do under diss milar circumstances, and
without regard to the pr nciple on which we acted.
In proposing the measure I have, I yield to the
necessity of remedying a great and growing evil,
originating m the fact that this Government is the
owner and administrator of a large portion of the
territories of nine States of this Union, and which
cannot be remedied so long as their ownership and
administratorship continue. It is the number and
influence of the States in which they exist, that
give such magnitude and danger to the evil, aid
what we may do now, under such circumstances,
cannot constitute a precedent, to be extended in
the manner which the Sena'or supposes it will be
On the contrary, by adopting the measure, we
would enlist the new States, now opposed to ih" old
on almost all questions growing out of the public
land', to aid in vigilantly guarding the residue of
the public domain
The Senator from Massachusetts [Mr Webster]
took different grounds. He insisted that cession
necessarily implies gift, and therefore, as I sup-
pose, the one I have proposed is i gift, in spite of
the many valuable considerations inducing to it I
do not attach the same meanm? to he word which
he does, but, as I have no taste for verbal criticism,
I have assented to the request of a friend, to change
"cession" to "dispose ot"—the words uspd in the
Constitution, and which, on the authority of the
- two Senators, are of such comprehensive meaning
as to confer on Congress unlimited power to do as
they please with the public lands
But it seems that, so soon as I had availed my-
self of this comprehensive term, it forthwith con-
tracted to the mrrowest limit* I was told the
lands éould not b  di po«ed of to the Slates. "Why
not? They can b  dispo ed of to individuals, and
to companies of in lividuals, and whv not to that
company or community of mdividuiU which con-
stitutes a Stale?  Can any pood K'ason be a signr-d'
I am next told lint we may dispose of them
absolutely, but not conditionally I again re-
peat the question—why 1101? What is it that
limits our power? We can dispose of the lands
to individuals on conditon, of which (hTe are
str king instances in lands containing lead mines.
They are leased fit a term < f years on con-
dition that otic ten'h of the lead be paid to
the Government m kind If tins cm be dore for a
term of jeais, what is to prevent it fiom bein,;
done forever, on the sime condm >r ? And, if k>,
why may we not prescribe the ru>s on «huh the
mines shall be worker1' If ill tin  can be done m
the case of individual , what is to prewnt it from
disposing ot the piiolic hnds to ihe S Alts, on ihe
condilitns proposed, and to pre cube (he rnUs to be
observed by them in ihe «ales ard management—
that }$, to adopt the measuie Í have pit posed?
It ii next objected, th t it is not a di position of
the lands, but metcly a transfer of the adm mMn
Hon of them to the States I deny ihe f,\< t It is
intended, and ism reality, a comliuonal disposition
or sale to the S a (s Bat if it were otherwise, and
as supposed, 1 •• li, what is there to prevent Con-
gress frora di po ing of t e >and, by an agency, or
to emply the Sta es as the ajenf, J>nd prescribe the
rule- by which ihey shall be disponed ot? I can
see no solid oojecticn to such arrangement, In' do
not deem it necessaiy to discuss the p >mt, because
the fact is not a1-   s supposed
Then folios s the oljpction that it would create
the relation of or d tir and debitrbetween this Go-
vernment and t'eS tes Admit it to be the fac ,
I ask, is that reku n more objecuomble, or as
much so, as ihat vhich now exists of landlord and
tenant, growir<* out ef ovneishjp and adminis-
tration m this Go/crnrrent ot so large a part
of the domain of ihe^e S ate —a re'ation which
is the parent of si many evils both to them
and u>? Bat, to put aa eud to th-¡ objection, 1
h«ve> on the suggest on of som> of ihe members
from the new States, so modified my proposi-
tion as to provide that the sixty-five pir cení of
the proceeds of the sales com ng to the Govern-
ment, shall be paid directly to us own officers—
say the marshals in each of the S ates. Now, 1
ask the opponents of the measure to join me, and,
by the cession, to pat an end, in the only w->y it
can be done, to the still mare objectionable relation
of landlord and tenant between this Government
and the States
It is further objected, thst it would not settle the
question It is said, if w<  cele the 'ands, the n«xt
demand would be to relinquish that po-tion of the
proceeds of their sales which is to be paid to the
Government, thai concession would have to follow
concession, till thefehole would be lost This sir,
is the old answer which the advocates of existing
abuses are ever ready to give those who complain
It is the answer of Lord North in the controversy
which led to our Revolution. He refused to yield
the disputed right of taxing the colonies, on the
ground that to yield would not sat sfy them If
taxation was surrendered, he said, it would not set-
tle the question, that their next demand would be
to surrender ihe right of regjlatmg their commerce
The result of such blind obstinacy was the dis-
memberment of the British Empire.
There is not a feature which more strongly dis-
tinguishes the firm and enligh entd statesman from
the obstinate or weak, than that of knowing when
it is propel unmake conces.su n«, as the means of
avoiding, in the end, the humiliation of submission
on the one hand, or the mort fication of defeat on
the other, and never was there an occasion, or a
question, when it was more politic than at this
time, and on this question. It may now be made
with dignity The questi<n may now be adjusted
on just and honoiable terms, but, if it be delayed,
the new Slates will decide if, in a few \ ears, in
their own way, without asking our leave, by their
rapid relative increase in population and poliutal
weight.
Th/y are now anxious for a fair adjustment, and
we may satisly them, without making any real sa-
crifice on our pari, rind it is doing injustice to them
to supp se that, alter sol citing a measure srt libe-
ral, and from which they would derive such ?d
vantage^, ihey wohM suddenly lurn round and
condemn what they hid solicited, and make the
palpably urju't demand, that we should surrender
the portion of ihe preceeds coming to the Govern-
ment There is nothing in their past history that
would warrant such an imputation on their cha-
racter
It was next objected, thit the measure was une-
qual, and to prove it so, tue ctw* of Ohio, which
ha- but a small amount or public lpnds within is
limits to be di-posid of, wis c ntased with that
ofllliiKis, which has i large amiunt, aril, be
cause the portion ot ihe proceeds to be al owed to
the Sutes (3*) per cent f the yi oís amount) wou'd
be símil in the ca e of the* former, when compared
with that of the hue, ihe meisuie is pronoi no d
unequal and unjust If it w -r« i sereme of di n
button, as has bren erroneously al = ed, such
might be thp fact, but as, instead of that, it is a
mere compensation r.r commission for tnub'e, ex-
pense, lesponsibiliiies to be incurred, and services
rendered, so far from 1 eing unequal, because the
amount to be received m ihe one ra«e was not
equal to that in the other, it is precisely the reverse
Equality of compensation for eqral expense and
service, is equal, but equably for unequal expense
and seivice, would be glaringly unequal, an t, had
I proposed t allow Ohio t e ame amount of com-
pensad! n for the expense and trouble of managing
the sma 1 pon on o ihe puuhc domain m her li-
mits as tiat to be allowed to Illino s for the ma-
nagement of ■he large porticn wi Inn her--, insteid
cf allowing a compensation to each proportioned
o their roptrtire txp"nus and strsices, it would,
so fai now being equal, have been gus^ly une-
qual, and would bwr been co prorounccd by those
who now raake this oljec'ion
In th s conneetioi, 1 must say that I cannot but
regiet that the S n«to from Ohio, [Mr Allfv,] ¡n
answer to the Senate r f-om Ken'ucky [Mr Ctai]
on this alleged ir equably bttw en Ohio and Illinois
did not meet him, by denying the truth cf hi- alle-
gation, instead of tne minner he did, whirh had,
to say the lea t, the appeirance of sustaining the
side to which he w most opposed, against that to
which he is less
[Mr Allen rose to explain Mr Calhoun said
he did not doubt that the Senator gave the true
explanation ei his vote, but did not think it was
called f >r at the time, and that the effect was as he
had stated.]
Ano h°r objection was, that it d d not eit^rd to
the Territories This objection had Ihe advai ate
(what few others had) of b°mg founded in fací, bat
was unfounded in reason Had it been extended
to them, it would have gone beyond the mischief,
and would have be n wholly improper The ev.l,
I repeat, originates in the fact of the Government
being the owner and administrator of so large a
portion of the domain of nrae Slates of the Unitn,
(being more than one-third of the whole,) and must
mcrea e, so long as ¡t remains, with the increased
namber and rdaiive weight of the ne  States.
They will soon be increased to twelve, by the ad-
mission of the three Terri'ones, with a correspond-
ing increase of weight in the Government The
Territories, on the ct n rary, are without political
weight, and, of cojrss with ihe object m view, it
would have been preposterous to have included
them.
As li tie force is there in the oh] cion, that some
of the States would not accept of the cession. It
is possible ihat 0 no and Indiana might not, but
not probab'e, as the amount of public land within
iheir borders is incon*'derable. But what of tba ?
Should it prove to be the ca«e, what possible injury
could result1 The fact ot not accepting would be
pioof conclusive that the evil to be removed acted
wuh but little relative foice in either, and that ihs
old system might be left to go on quietly in bolh,
until the land within tneir limits was all disposed
o' But the esse is very different in the ether se-
ven In them, it ii in active operation, and ihey
would glad y accept ef the c ss¡< n, as Ihe only re-
medy ihat can reach the disease, consistently with
the interests ol all concerned.
I rome now to the final objection—that the land
sjstem is working well anlthat we ought to adhere
to the old maxim, "Let well enough alone" I
say the final, is it is the last Í recollect If (as is
possible—I look no no es) I have omitted to notice
any objection made by tbe opporents of the mea-
sure, I call on them to name it now, that I may an-
swer it before I proceed to notice the one just
stated.
When I first addressed the Senate on this sub-
ject, at the opening of the discussion, I admitted
Ihat the system worked well at first, but I must
limit the admission to its earl est stages. Prom the
beginning, it con-tare! wit'm l'selt ih" seeds of
mighfy disorders, and of great evil to thecounfiy,
if i othing shoti'd be dore to aiert them If I e'o
not greatly mistake ihe tendency of the sy.te7i as it
stands it is t) ext ngui«h the Indian titles far moie
laptdly than ihe d=iiirc's of our mcreasn g popu-
lation require, and fo disperse tuipopuht n mex
a larger space than is des rabie Wt the good of the
crunry That hefoimerof these euls exists in
realitv, the proof is conclusive, and that it is alrea-
dy the cau^e of much difficulty and danger, and
that both are rap dl/ on the increase, so
as to threa'en the loss of tbe lands themselves, I
have, I trus', conclusively shown in my former re-
marks It is sufficient here to repeat, in order to
sho x that the Indian title has been too rapidly ex-
tinguished, that ihe Government has sold, trom the
beginning of the system, (now almost half a cen-
tury,) but little more lhan eighty millions of acre ,
and that not les, than twenty m Ihons, probably,
are held by large ho'ders, who purchased on specu-
lation to sell again, making these u«l demand for
land for settlerrent not execedirg, probably, sixiy
millions m that long period of tune Bu', during
the same period, the Incnn tite has been extin-
guished to about three hundred and twenty nil-
lions of acre , of *t ch about two hundied and
twenty six millions reman unsold—exceeding four-
fo d the demand for lands in consequ'neeof ihe
increase (f our p< pula ion Such is the fact To
what cau«e a it to be altiibuter"! I feel confident
it will be principally found in the land system
itself, vhich has b°en so indiscriminately praised
dur ng the d scussion.
But, before I proceed to assign my leasons, it
will be proper to pause and reflect on the influence
that the occupation of the ab  rigines, whom we
are so rapidly expelling, has had, through the mys-
terious dispensation of Providence, on the prospe-
