MEMPHIS, January 10, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

My cavalry force which left Memphis on December 21, after having totally destroyed the Mobile and Ohio Railroad to Egypt ten miles south of Okolona, has reached Vicksburg in safety and in good condition. General Grierson reports having assaulted and captured the enemy's stockade at Egypt on the 28th. Frank Gardner, with 2,000 infantry was in sight, on two trains of cars, to re-enforce the garrison, but was prevented, and the place was taken by assault, with 500 prisoners. The enemy having collected south of Egypt in too great force, Grierson then marched west, destroy all public property at Grenada and thirty miles of the Mississippi Central Railroad, and reached Vicksburg on the 5th instant, having marched 450 miles. Our loss is some 25 killed and 80 wounded. The results of the expedition may be summed up as follows: The enemy lost in killed and wounded 150, including among the former Brigadier-General Gholson, 1 colonel, 1 major. The prisoners brought in are 550, including 2 colonels, 30 other officers. The destruction of 80 miles of railroad, including about 35 bridges, 300 army wagons (mostly captured from Sturgis); 5,000 stand of new arms; 4 serviceable locomotives, and 10 undergoing repairs; 100 cars, and a pile-driver and engine; the new machine-shop at Grenada; the factories for cloth and shoes at Barkston, which employed 500 hands and turned out 1,000 yards per day; large amounts of clothing wools, cotton, and leather; immense amount of ammunition, commissary stores, new wagons, new pontoons, &amp;c., on the way to Hood; 700 head of fat hogs; heavy stores of corn and wheat. The command arrived at Vicksburg with 1,000 negroes, mostly able-bodied and 800 head of captured mules and horses. Full

particulars of this most brilliant raid will be sent by mail. I am sending Grierson's and Winslow's cavalry to Louisville, in obedience to former orders. Hood and Forrest being now at Corinth the cavalry not absolutely required in Kentucky or north to be here.

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
