President's Message—Mn. Bell.
Ho. of Reps.
Btour upon the banking institutions of the conn-
try, I will not undertake to answer it in my own
language, or by any arguments of my own, for
I have never felt disposed to become the cham-
pion of those institutions, bat in the language
and by the arguments of a man of far more weight
and influence, both from the station which he
fills, and the larger snare of respeet and influence
he has always enjoyed with the party in power—
a man whose political career was directly con-
nected with the most extraordinary incidents of
the late Administration—a man who owes his
present elevation to the hearty approval with
which his party sustained him in the most_ques-
tionable act of that Administration—a raan-wliose
opinions upon the question now under review
were then received as orthodox and incontrovert
lble I allude to the Chief Justice of the United
States, (Mr Taney )
[Mr B read from a letter of Mr. Taney, while
Secretary of the Treasury, to the Committee of
Ways and Means, of the 13th of April, 1834, a
few paragraphs strongly commendatory of the
State banks, and assei ting in very biond terms the
indispensable agency in a country like ouis of
banks and a papei cnculalion founded on cicdit 1
But, Mr Chan man, if I correctly undeistand
the import of the passage now under considei anon,
it manifests a laxity of punciple, a recklessness
of consequences, such a spirit of despciuiion in
the choice of means to sustain powei as ought to
leccive the sevcie¡.t it piclicnsiuu liom eveiy well
wishei to oui liee institutions Una coveit dc
nunciation of wealth and ot the rich is, without
doubt, intended to be undnstood byiliohe whom
it plefts.es asn pi oof that the authoi ol it is a fi lend
and champion of the poor as distinguished fiom

In the remarks I piopose to make on the senti-
ment hero expressed, I would not be understood
as finding fault with the extension of the light of
suffrage IntheStati of rennpssieand the south
west gentuilly, the light of sulTiage has long ex-
isted in the fullest extent, nor am 1 disposed to
say aught against the policy of other Slates, in
this respect, but 1 have a woid or two to say in
reference to the conclusion which the Piesidcnt
has drawn from this and othei changi s in our
local institutions He undertakes to announce to
the world that the (fleet of these changes has been
to *' inciense the din ct influence of ihc mass ot
the community, and to restnetmoie and more the
powcis of Goveinment " Now, sir, however
true this may be, when affiimed of the mflu< nee
of the mass of the community, in the seveial
States alluded to, and upon the measures and pol
icy and the resttiettons winch may have followed
upon tht poweis of the State governments, if it
is intended, by inference, to affiim that the direct
influence of the mass of the community upon the
measures and policy of the National Government
has been increased, or that the powers of the Gen
eral Government have been restiicted by any
changes which have been made in any quarter, I
deny that such is the fact I make the issue di
rect I affirm that whatever improvements may
have followed from the changes of any kind in
the constitutions of the States, whatevei reduc-
tions may have followed upon the poweis oí the
State governments, no such beneficial conse-
quences have been filt m the opeiations of the
Federal Government though we might have sup
posed that the benefits of the extension of the
light of suffrage, or other change in the local in
jmtutjons, would have been felt, in some small
degree at IctwJt, tn the action ol the General Gov-
ernment
But, sir, at no anterior period in the history of
this country has the influence, direct and indirect,
of the masa of the community been so little felt
in the conduct of our national affairs, nor have
the powers of the Federal Government ever be-
fore been strained to so high a point, if we may
judge of these powers by the practice of the late
and present Administrations Never before were
the mass of the community so powerless Of
late, they have substantially nothing to do, hav-
ing neither part nor lot in the affans of the Gov-
ernment or of the country, but to follow blindly,
and give their sanction, when called upon for that
purpose, to whatever schemes and measures of
public policy the heads of the party, some three
or foui men at most, are pleased to dictate to
them Such is and has been the power of party
discipline, such the despotic principle of party as
sociation for years, that the mass of the commu-
nity have rathei stood in the relation of subjects
to be governed, than the contiolling elements of
power How this has been brought about—by
what artful means—by what powers of intimida
tion on the one hand, and of seduction on the
other, the mass of the people have had so little
actual influence in the affairs of Government of
late—I have often descubed on this floor I have
leneatcdly lefened to this subject as theongin of
all the evils which now afflict the country I
content myself, for the present, by repeating that
the mass of the people have for yeais been de-
giaded to the rank of mere machines in the hands
of a few men who have had the talent and address
to use them for their own pui poses Never be-
fore were a fiee people under such positive, such
despotic control, as the people of the United
States have been, by the aitful management of a
few men, acting in conjunction with the powerful
influences of ovi rgi own patronage I agiin affirm
that at no penod since the oigamzation of the
Goveinment, ni 1789, have its poweis been so
ixunsive m piaelice Of late, they have un-
doubtedly been earned far beyond the i xample
of onv piecedmg Administration 'Ihen, sir, I
conclude that the Pi csident holds out an unfounded
assuiancc to the country We cannot safely con-
gratulate ourscivis that the people have had the
spin re of their influence ineieased, or that the
powirs ot the Government have been íestricted
After enumerating many of the happy results
of out republican institutions, the Piesidentex-
piesses the following sentiment
" Uní r( view of the rt utts of our institutions for hilf
a Cfiitury, with lit exciting a hpint ot vum < filiation,
| should serve to iiupre&s upon us lile great principles from
¡ win ll the} &JIU ii{— onstait ant direct *t(; crttilon lythe
people oier e eiy prtllli measure, ' &e
Now, sir, I should be pleased to be informed
what is meant by the " constant and direct Awpei
vision of the people," which is here enumerated as
one of the gieat principles to which we aie ln-
dt btcd for the glonous results of our system
Will some gentleman who is better acquainted
with the sentiments of the President upon this
subject enlighten me? Will he tell me what is
the tiue lmpoit of the language, " the constant and
diiect supei vision by the people? ' It is intended
by this passage in the message, and the other
docttinea which are more or less openly nicul
cated, to give the high official sanction of the
Chief Magistrate of the Union to the new impulse
which has lecently been given, or sought to be
given, to what aie called the democratic tenden-
cies ol oui system? "iou must be aware, Mr
Chairman, that unusual pains have been taken of
late to show that our system needs a ladical re-
vision The people are told that our ancestors,
who flamed the Constitution in 1789, weieahalf
c< ntury m the rear of the improvements of the
piesent age, that they had not the benefit of the
new lights which expenence has shed upon the
subject of government since that timi, and which
are now in full blaze around us The science of
government, we are told, has made great sttides
since our Constitution was formed, and, indted,
that instrument is beginning to be looked upon by
many lather as a device ot bad men, to advance
the tnteiests of the few at the expense of the
many, and forming an actual obstruction to that
full tide of happiness and prosperity which awaits
us when the inventions of modern Democracy
thajl be substituted for it     At all events, it is
proclaimed to be the duty of every man who
would improve the condition of the human fam-
ily to strengthen the democratic tendencies of the
Constitution, and to disrobe, or rather strip, it of
those limitations or restrictions upon the popular
will, with which our unimproved ancestors have
thought it necessary to encumber it
Some progress has already been made m im-
planting this sentiment among the people in some
of the States New party names have been in
vented for this purpose New definitions have
been given of free Governments An old-fash-
ioned republican is denounced as little better
than an aristocrat. We hear, of Jate, fiom the
leaders of one of the great parties which divide
the country, of little else than the Democracy of
the country—the great Democratic founder—the
Democracy of numbers' Jn truth, sir, it cannot
be disguised that there are a class of politicians
in the country at this moment whose aspirations
it does not suit that any restriction, any limit-
ation whatever, shall exist in the practice of the
Government upon the will Or absolutism of the
majority, and, in the estimation of ail their fol-
lowers, our Constitution is defective It imposes
quite too many tiammels, in their judgments,
upon the beneficent designs of the reformers
Does the Piesident mean to be understood as
countenancing the doctrines of these reformers,
by pointing to the " constant and direct super-
vision by the people" asan impoitant principle
m a free Government' Sir, 1 would be the last
man in this House to question the titu consilium
tional pmciple of popular supeivision over the
measures ot the Goveinment It is to the oper
anon of that principle that we are to look for
safety in times which, perhaps, may he worse
than the piesent, and 1 trust we shall not look to
it in vain But, sir, accoiding to our system, the
people do not, and cannot, exercise any direct
supervision over any public measure Their
power, their influence, then supervision, can be
constitutionally exercised only by pi tition and
lemonstiance, and by the utteiance of theirvoice
at the ballot box And it is ihat feature in our
system that at once distinguishes it in form fiom
a demociacy, and secuies it fiom the fatal catas
trophe which has always attended clemociacies,
or Governments in which the people exercised a
diiect supervision over public measures
But it would begiatifymg to know whatc/iiwige
in oui Constitution is meditand by which the
people may btadmitted to a "direct supeivision"
ot public measures, or is it intended that the peo-
ple shall interpose then authority whenever, in
their judgment, the constitutional functionanes
shall en, oi fail in the dischaige of their duty,
without any amendment of the Constitution > We
have vei y lately had a specimen of this improved
system of government announced through the
medium of an Fxerutive communication We
have heard the doctnne proclaimed on this floor,
I we have sen it announced in several of the most
influential journals in the country, and, among
the lest, the official oigan of this Administiation,
I (the Globe,) that the dnect mteiference of the
' people, or, in other words, the democracy of the
countiy, m the settlement of constitutional and
legal questions, i& not only allowable, but justifi-
able' We have heard it proclaimed fiom all these
high and authoutative sources that an excited
and agitated assembly of the people may properly
rush into a legislative hall, fill all the aisles and
other vacant places, and, by their menaces and
clamors for the blood of obnoxious individuals,
drive the Speaker fiom his chair, and the mem-
bers fiom then seats' In such a proceeding, it
is said there is " no positive violence," and when
successful, it is proclaimed a triumph of the de-
mocracy—a triumph of the people' Is this the
sort of " direct supervision " of the people which
has been the sou ice of so many happy and glo-
rious results past, or is it only fiom such a super-
vision of the people that the future peace and
happiness and prospenty of the country are to
spring? Is it alieaiiy come to this, under the
refoiming hand of the party in powei, that if on
an occasion ¡,nnilai to that which occurred in this
House only a year ago—1 allude to the vote of
the House in excluding the members fiom Mis-
sissippi, [Messn. Pkdntiss and Word,] although
clearly chosen by the people of Mississippi, upon
