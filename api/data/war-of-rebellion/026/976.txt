If my men are not too much broken down I will move upon Williamsburg near enough to attack to-morrow evening or by daylight next morning. I send you a note* from Colonel Tabb, which met me on the way. Infantry or no infantry, enemy re-enforced or not, I will certainly attack them Saturday morning as early as my men can take aim. I find the forces here deficient in ammunition, and beg you to forward some, according to the accompanying requisitions, with dispatch.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY A. WISE,

Brigadier-General.

NAVY DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, April 10, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to request that the James River obstructions be opened at the earliest practicable moment, to permit the Richmond to pass below them.

I deem it very important that our armed vessels in the river should be able to pass the barrier at any time, and I respectfully suggest that this be provided for. The large schooner Galego may perhaps be used in connection with this measure.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary of the Navy.

[Indorsements.]

APRIL 11, 1863.

Respectfully referred to the President for his consideration.

J. A. S.,

Secretary.

It would be well, before action, to have a report and opinion of the Chief Engineer.

J. D.
