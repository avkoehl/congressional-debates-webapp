General Ransom's report was incorrect. He was so far in Tennessee, and the means of communication so uncertain, that I feared to return it for correction, lest it might fall into the hands of the enemy, and it was therefore retained until General Ransom returned nearer to Bristol. My report of course detained in consequence.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
