tions- and shocks These propositions he held to
be mcontrovertiole. He would be glad to hear
any member n=e m his place and attempt to
answer them
Nor would tne Treasury be a particle more
independent of the banks than undei the deposite
system, before the suspensio i of specie payment*
The revenue, as, he had said, would be collected
under this bill, should it pass, as it was then, ex-
clusively in bank notes, w hich, on another suspen-
sion, would be just as worthless in the hands of
the odicers 11 whose custody fh>y might be de-
posited, as thev «ould be in the bai is themse'ves,
and which, ol course, «ould again c< mpcl the
Government, m such an event, to pay us debts in
worthless rags to its own gieat disci edit, and the
loss of its creditor , or not paj them at all Nor
would it be possib'e, auj more ihxn in the present
mstancp, to eol'ect its debts in the legal curiency
ol the country Gold and silver «ould as cer-
tainly disappear as completely from circulation,
under the operation of this bill, as it did under the
syolem of binlc deposite that existed at the time of
the late suspension
But if it mil have no effect m rendenng ihe
Treasury more independent of the banks, nor in
limiting banking operations or profits, is itceitain-
ly will not where, he isKed, wi'l it din"ti horn the
late deposjre system u"dei the act of '36, which
tins bill is intended to supersede! There is and
can be but one point ol difiere nee, viz in the dii~
tnbu ion ol Ihe prolils from the deposites, and even
that diiit.ri.rce, he would show, is more apparent
than real Where tne revenue is deposited with
certain banks, selected by the Secretary of the Trea-
sury, as under th  act of ,56, the profits ol the de-
pt s <rs icciue almost exclusively to them They

lence, that when the bank «as selected, it would,
uncer th act of 183b, be under the control and
protection oí law, but the oilicers would be com-
pleted under the co itrol oí the head of the depart-
mtnt at all times This is the sum total of the dif
ference If you pas this bill jou have the one,
and if jou defeat it jou have the other
Thus regarding ¡t, and b mg opposed on consti-
tutional gr m ds to receiving any thing bat the legal
currency of the count y, or Government securities,
in the publ c dues, and to the increase of Executive
pa'ron->g°, re cou'd not possibly vote for the bill as
amended He 'vas decidedly opposed to a" dis-
cretionary pov °rs, especially m the Executive
branch of the Gov eminent, and this bill would give
greater th-n any that has ever passed It would
noi only give the power to which he has already
alluded of favoring what bank it pleased, but the
controlling power of demanding specie at pleasure
of the Executive, of any bask it might desire to
©ppress, and abstaining from demanding ot those it
intended to favor Powers such as these he re-
garded as incompatible with our free system of Go-
vernment, and he for one could not consent to con-
fer them
But he hid other and insuperable objections. In
giving the bill originally Ins support, he was go-
verned by a deep conviction thai the total separa-
tion oi the Government and the banks was indis-
pensable He firmly believed that we had leached
a point where ihe separation was absolutely neces-
sary to save both Government and banks He was
under a strong impiession that the banking system
hid reached a point of decrepitude—that great and
important changes were necessary to save it and
prevent convulsions, and that the first step was a
perpetual separation between them and the Govern-
ment But there could be, m his opinion, no sepa
lation—no divorce—without collecting the public
dues in. the legal and eons itutionii currency of the
country Without that, all would prove a perfect
delusion, as this bill would prove should it pass
We had no constitutional light to treat the notes of
weie prívale corporations as cash, and it we did,
nothing would be done
These \ ipvv s, and many others s,m,lar, he had
openly expressed, in which the groat body of the
gentlemen aroutd him had concurred We stand
openly pledged to them before the country and the
world We had fought the bailie manfully and
successfully The cause was good, and having
stood the first shock, nothing was necessary, but
fumii"ss, stan ling fast on oui position to ensure
victoiy—a great and glorious vietory in a noble
cause, which was calculated to effect a more im-
pottant reformation m the condition of society
than any in oui time—ho, foi one, could not agree
to terminate all those mighty efforts, at this and
the extra session, by leturning to a complete and
perfect reunion v ith the links in the worst and
most dangerous foim He would not belie all
that he had said and done, by \ i ting lor the bill
as it now stood amended, and to terminate that

in ¡it. prest ni form would be to assume, not only
the responsibility ol acting, but of leaving things
in a wur e condition than we find them, to strike
the disease deeper into the sjstcm, and render it
more concealed and dangerous, while the attention
of the patient would be withdrawn for a time
from his danger If, on the contrary, we stand
fast on our principles and professions, and suffer
the bill to be lost rather loin to yield our principles,
the public a'tention would be doubly roused, the
subject would be more tu'ly and peifectly investi-
gated and understood, and the great cause we have
so nobly supported would finally and r'orioUoly

REMARKS OF MB. DtROMGOOLS,
Op Virginia,
In the House of RepmtnMmes, Jlpril 19, 1838—Ex.
planatory of his amendment offered to the r so-
lution oi his colleague, (Mr. Hopkins )
Mr DROMGOOLE, having succeeded in obtain-
ing the floor, remarked that it had been his purpose
on yesterday, when he submitted the amendment
now under consideration, to accompany th," same
with a lew observations m explanation He was,
however, prevented from fulfilling his intention on
account of his colleague [Mi Wise] having antici-
pated him in getting the floot and consuming the
remainder ot the morning hour If his colleague,
who had again this morning occupied the attention
of the House, and who had just taken his seat,
could have forborne for a short time, and waued
to hear his (Mr. D's) m'ended explanations, he felt
confident that the trouble of supposing that the
slightest imputation or reflection upon the select
committees, to which reference had been matle,
might well have been spared.
[Here Mr Wis*, rose, and was understood tosay
that he owed an apology to his colleague tor having
on yesterday preceded him ]
Mr Dromcoole said, m reply, that no apology
was necessary, that he had not made reference to it
with any ieelmgof dissatisfaction, or for the pur-
pose of censure or complaint, and he took this oc-
casion to return his colleague his tnanks for the
very prompt and decided manner in which he then
expressed his determination to sustain the proposed
amendment. The resolution offered by his col-
league IMr Hopkins] refers to abuses which have
gradually crspt into the practice and proceedings
of this House, whereby its expenditures have been
greatly and unnecessarily augmented Retrench-
ment and reform is proposed to be systematically
mlioduced, and guards are to be set against the re-
currence oí similar abuses and conupuons, and for
complete secuuty in all future time Now, said
Mr D the subjicts embraced m the proposed
amendment have an immediate and direct connec-
tion with the purposes and objects oí the original
resolution He [Mr Hopkins] proposes a fa thful
and comprehensive examination inio all extrava-
gancies and mal-iractices, and, in order to pre-
serve the purity of llv pr ss from the arlarming
corruption engendered by the pa lonage exercised
in the appointmi nt ol printer, he deems it wdis-
pensibly necassary that toe political journals and
the public printing shall be entirely d sconnected
So t oroughly convinced is my honorable colleague,
that the employment of an editor to execute the
printing required to be done by order of this
House, sheds a baneful and contami íating influ-
ence ovei his morals and his poli'ical principles,
that he is constrained to b come the advocate of a
total and an absolute divorce between the po1 tical
press and thf Government p mting, and, further-
more, with a view to screen them from temptati n,
and preserve ibeir integ'i j, ie wou d provide by
law, that all conductor of evvspapeis shotiid be
foievei proscribed from being employed to do any
printing, oihciall} requued to be ■'oiie, for their
Govirnment and then country
It had occurred to him, said Mr D that his
honorable colleague, the mover of ihe original
resolution, mus' hue lately espoused the opinions
now held by him, and must have v<.ry recently be-
come a conven to the d ictnnes now promulgated.
As they have not heretofore b^en avowed and ad-
vocated, it would seem to be not an improbable
conjecture that they have been produced by serious
reflection upin the circumstances connected with
the last election of pi nttr by th" House of Repre-
sentatives Sir, the candidates on that occasion,
the protracted struggle, the interest and the excite-
ment manifesté 1, are still freshly remembered by
all Aftt r the close of ihe election, witn but little
delay, and with remarkable promptitude, it was
announced in the Jiaaonal Intelligencer that the
punting would be executed m that office, and not
in the office of the elected printer, who was not
prepared to do it
It is the c irrent rumor that such ts still dis-
arrangement
Before Mr  D   proceeded to state the reasons
'I and consideiations which,  in his mind,   amply
