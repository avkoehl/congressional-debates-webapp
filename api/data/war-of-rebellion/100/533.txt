Lieutenant Colonel MAX. WOODHULL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: I respectfully report that at 4 a. m. to-day, as directed in orders received from corps headquarters, I broke my camp on Occoquan River and moved in the direction of Alexandria on the main Alexandria road. Upon reaching Pohick Church I took advantage of the privilege granted in my orders, and moved my infantry column on a byroad to the right in the direction of Mount Vernon, my trains continuing on the main telegraph road. Arriving at Mount Vernon my division was marched through the inclosure around Mount Vernon grounds, passing directly in front of the tomb of Washington. The command having all witnessed the sacred burial place, the direct march was resumed by country and other roads as far in the direction of Alexandria as my present camp, which is on the right of the telegraph road, some three miles from the village. My headquarters are on the road, one-quarter of a mile in rear of my line, which fronts toward the southwest.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. R. WOODS,

Brevet Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

The rebel War Department papers left Raleigh on the evening of the 17th, via New Berne, or Beaufort, and probably will not touch at Fort Monroe. I will ascertain the name of the vessel and time of sailing.
