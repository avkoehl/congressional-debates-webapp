HEADQUARTERS SIXTH DIVISION CAVALRY,November 27, 1864

[Captain J. N. ANDREWS:]

CAPTAIN: In reply to your note I beg leave to say that there is a squadron of Croxton's brigade at Huey's Mill, with orders to report promptly any movement of the enemy; they communicate with Capron's pickets above. In case of a necessity for it I propose to re-enforce them at once. No report from the party sent toward Shelbyville, from which I infer that the enemy's cavalry have not gone in that direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. JOHNSON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

General Schofield has heard from the party sent to the lower ford; all right. Your order to burn the mills is right.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Commanding Sixth Division, Cavalry Corps:

You can order rations to Colonel Capron via Franklin, though a small escort will be necessary for the train. Direct the wagons to return to the general trains of the army as soon as they have delivered the rations. I think you had better send Colonel Harrison to the brigade to which he has been assigned as soon as possible, with orders to do all in his power mounting it in the country. Instruct him also that he is not expected to hold all fords on the river, but sim-
