toward Rolla or Pilot Knob. I desire you to keep yourself thoroughly informed of their movements, and to be prepared to meet them. I will instruct General Totten to move to your support in the event of an advance by the enemy. General Totten's division is encamped on Elk Creek, about 22 miles southeast of this place. Inform General Totten of any movement of the enemy with may require his co-operation with you, and he will act accordingly. You will, of course, keep me advised of all that may be of importance. I will advise you of any movement I may make from this place.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Colonel WILLIAM WEER,

Commanding First Division, near Mount Vernon:

I have reason to apprehend an attack upon the force at Forsyth by Marmaduke's force. You will please move rapidly with the main body of your command toward that place, and support it if it be threatened. I have directed Lieutenant-Colonel Kent, in command at Forsyth, to communicate with you. Be guided by the information you may get from him and from other sources. It may not be necessary for you do go entirely to Forsyth; possibly also Springfield may be threatened. You will, of course, support the garrison there, if necessary.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General CURTIS:

Your dispatch of yesterday was received this morning. I have instructed Colonel Geiger to watch the enemy's movements, and General Totten to join him and move against McCulloch, if he came in a northern direction. I apprehend his move will be on Forsyth or Fayetteville, rather than in the direction indicated. I have ordered Colonel Weer to move to the support of Forsyth, and requested Colonel Cloud to send a battery and some cavalry there at once, as he is nearer than Colonel Weer; but, as you are aware, no considerable force can be supported there longer than a few days. The small force now there had to go from 30 to 40 miles south for forage. A foraging party was attacked 20 miles south of Forsyth yesterday, by about 400 rebels. They were still fighting when heard from, and Lieutenant-Colonel Kent had sent out re-enforcements. To attempt to hold that place longer with the small force that can be supported there, while the other troops are in their present positions, will only be to expose the small force to capture if the enemy choose to make the attempt.
