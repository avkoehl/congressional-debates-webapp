WINCHESTER, VA., July 22, 1864.

Major-General HUNTER,

Commanding:

I have the honor to report that I arrived here at noon to-day. The enemy have all left in the direction of Strasburg and Front Royal, the last of them leaving here yesterday morning before day-light. I want to remain here a day or two to give the enemy the impression we will not follow them, so that they may send a good portion of their command to Richmond. I have not force sufficient to meet all their force in this open valley, and my only hope is for them to divide their command.

GEO. CROOK.
HDQRS. ARMY OF KANAWHA, DEPT. OF W. VIRGINIA,Winchester, Va., July 22, 1864.

General CROOK:

GENERAL: Lieutenant Blackman, of Colonel Powell's staff, has just come in from Newtown, and reports that Colonel Powell is being driven back by a heavy force of the enemy. He is out of ammunition and sent in to have General Duffie come out and re-enforce him. I will keep the officer here until you give orders.

Very respectfully,

JAMES L. BOTSFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
