SAMUEL B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 29, 1864.

Brigadier General E. B. TYLER,

Relay House:

It is reported that Mosby and White have crossed the Potomac at

Edwards and Conrad's Ferries, with 400 cavalry and three pieces of artillery. Send out your cavalry immediately, if it is within reach; if not, send for it as quickly as possible. Use McNulty's cavalry also if it has not yet started for Washington; if so, stop it if you can. Distribute your infantry judiciously, to protect the railroad, and also any of Wright's trains on the Rockville and Frederick pike. You will be speedily re-enforced. Make frequent reports of the information you get.

Upon consideration, you will take the regiment and battery to Ridgeville, and proceed with them to Clarksburg via Damascus, on Rocksville and Frederick pike, with the double view of covering the railroad and General Wright's wagon train.
