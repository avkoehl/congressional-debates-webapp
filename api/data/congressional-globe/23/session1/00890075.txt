dismiss ng his Secretary without safficien' Ct.use '
To this accusation there aie ready answers fust,
that the Piesident may disuu-s  las 6>e<ietaues
without cause, secondly, that the Senate has no
cognizance of the ca^c, thirdly, that the Senate
cannot assume to know for what cause the Secre-
tary in question was dismissed                                  '
The Secietary of the Treasuiy is on trial In
order to get at the President it was found neces
•saiytoget at a gertleman who hid no voice on
this floor. It had been found recessaiy to assail
the Secretaiy of the Trea ury in a manner here-
tofoie unexampled in the histoiy of the Senate Í
His religion, h>s politics,his veracity, his under
standing, his Missouri lestriction vo e, had all
been anaigned Mr B said he would leave his
religion to the Constitution of the United States,
Catholic as he wag, and although " the Piesbyte
íiflíi might cut off his head he fust time he iicnt In
mass " ills understanding he would leave to him-
self The head which could throw the paper
wh'oh was taken for a stone on tms flooi, but
which was in fact adouble-headed chain bhotfiicd
fiom a 48 pounder, cairymg sails, masts, rigging,
all before it, was a head that could take caie of
itself His veracity would be adjourned to the
trial wmch was to take place for misquo mg a let-
tei of Secretary Ciawford, and he had no douot
would end as the charge did for suppressing a let
tei which was printed in extenso among our docu-
ments, and withholding the name and compensa
Hon of an agent, when that rame and the fact of
no compensation was lying on the table The
Secretary of the Treasury wasarmgned for some
incidental vote on the Missouri restnetion when
he was a member of ti e Maryl ind Legislature
Mr Bei«to->i did not know what thaf vote was,
bat he d d know that a certain gentleman, who
lately stood in the relation of icigeant to another
gentleman in a certain high election was the leader
of the force which defoiced Missouu of her place
in the Union foi the entne ses&ion which he first
attended, not served, in the Senate of the United
States His politics could not be severely tried m
the time of 'he alien and sedition law, wken he
was scarce of age, but weie well tried during the
late war, when he sided with his country, and
received the constant del unciaMons of that gieat
organ of Federalism, the Federal Republican news-
paper For the res', Mr B admitted that the
Secretary had voted for the elder Adams to be
Pr esident of the United States, but denied the right
of certain persons to make that an objection to
him Mr B dismissed these peisonal charges for
the present, and would adjourn their cor"? iteration
unth his t lal came on, for which the Senator from
Kentucky [Mr Clíy] stood pledged, and aftei
the trial was over, he had no doubt but that the
Secietary ot the Tieasury, although a Catholic
and a Federalist, would be found to maintain his
station in the first lank of American gentlemen and
American patriots
Mi B took up the senous charges against the
Secretary, that of being the mere instrument of the
President in removing the deposites and violating |
the Constitution and laws of the land How far
he was this mere instrument, making up his mind
in three days to do what otheis would not do at
all, might be judged by every person who would
refer to the opposition papers for the division in
the Cabinet about the removal of the deposites,
and which constantly classed Mr Taney, then
Attorney General, on the side of íemoval This
classification was correct and notorious, and ought
to exempt an honoiable man, if anything could
exempt hnn,/iom the imputation of being a mere
instrument m a gieat transaction of which he was
? prime counseiloi The fact is, he had long since,
in his chaiacter of legal advisei to the President,
advised the removal of these deposites, and, when
suddenly and unexpectedly caded upon to take
the office which would make it his dutv to act
upon his own advice, he accepted it ftoin the sin-
gle sense of honoi and duty, and that he might not
seem to desert the P.esident in flinching from the
performance of what he had recommended His
personal honor was ciean, his personal conduct
magnanimous, his official deeds woald abide the
test of law and truth
Mi B said he would maVe short wmk of long
accusations, and demolish in three minutes what
has been concocting for thiee months, anddelner-
ing for three days in the Senate tie would call
the attention of the Senate to certain clauses of
law, uXiú certa n Tieasury instructions, which had
been left out of view, but which were decisive of
the accusation against the Secretaiy The first
was the clause in the bank charter whi h invested
the Secretary wi'h the power of transfemng the
public funds from place to place It was the 15 h
section of the chaiter, he would read it It enacted
that whenever íequired by the Secretary or the
iR^scrY the bank should give the necessary
facilities for transferring the public funds from
place to flace within theU\iTLD States or Ter-
ritories thepeof, and fo-DisrrnsuTiNG the same
in payment of the public creditors, &c
Here is authority to the Secretai y to tranifer the
public moneys from pHce to place, limited on'y
by the bounds of the United States and its Tern-
tones, and this clause, of three lines of law, puts
to flight all the nonsense about the United States
Bank being the Tieasitii/.and the Tieasurer bein¿
the keeper of the public moneys, with which some
politicians and newspapei waters had been woi
rymg tneir orains for the last thiee months In
virtue of this clause the Secretary of the Ti easury
gave certain tians*er drafts to the amount of two
millions and a quartei, and his legal right to give
the draft was just as clear under this clause of the
bank chaiter as his light to remove the deposites
vvuj undei another Clause of it The tiansfe! is
made by diaft, a payment out of the Tieasury is
made upon a uairant, and the d ffe-ence between
a transfer draft and a Treasury wanant was a
thing necessary to be known by eveiy man who
aspiied to the illuminating of a nation, oi e\en to
tne understanding of himself To make ths cleai,
Mt B read extracts from the Tieasury instructions
to banks of deposite in 1829, and from ceitam let-
ters fiom the Treasurei of tne United States to the
cashier of the Bank of the United States in the
month of Novembei last, which wou'd jjstify the
issue of the tiansfer draffs and quiet the aHims of
all those who thougnt the Treasurer had forfeited
the penal'y 0f ]llb bond, pnd the Secretary had
violated the clause of the Consti'ution which foi
bids money to bediawn from the Treasui y except
uoon wairants and under appropriation laws
They would show that the transfer drafts were not
wanants, that they drew nothing fiom the Tieas-
ury, but made a tieasury in evei y place into which
they carried money within the limits of the United
States or its Terntoi le", whethei there was a branch
of the United States Bank there or not

Aftei reading these ext> acts, Mr B took a po-
sition, and defied all attacks to dislodge him from
it It was this that a warrant for the payment
of money out of the Ti easury must, m addition to
other requisites, be countersigned by the Comp-
troller ot the Treasury, and the bank is forbid to
pay, and pays et its peul, any warrant not so
countersigned, the transfei draft is not so counter-
signed, the Comptroller does not so countersign it,
yet tne Bank of the United States paid these drafts,
to the amount of two millions and a quartei, with-
out t! c countei igmng of the CompticPer, and in
so doing, admitted that the morey was notdiawn
out of the Tieasury This was conclusive, and
put the Bin!; of the United States n the position
of contiadietmg itself, and contrad cting all its
advocates, in the assumption that the bank is the
Tieasury
Mr B took a further view of the new fangled
conception that the Bank of the United States was
the Treasury of the United States It followed
fiom thatdoctnne, that wheie there was no branch
of the Unted Sfttes Bank theie cou'd be no
Treasury, and no puolic moneys    Now, six or
