L. P. WALKER:

Captain Hill resigned and is now in one of the regular regiments of the State. The company is not well organized at present. Asked for cannon and to give up tier cannon a few days since; still have the cannon - only have three guns. Captain T. L. Cooper's company, of Atlanta, has three guns, and Captain Girardey, of Augusta, six guns. After this statement will telegraph to Athens if you wish.

Governor MOORE,

Baton Rouge, La.:

The news from Washington makes it indispensable to have that forces called for from our State sent to Pensacola without further delay. If you cannot comply with the call immediately without calling for volunteers, it is your duty to appeal to volunteers forthwith.

MOBILE, ALA, April 8, 1861.

His Excellency JEFFERSON DAVIS:

DEAR SIR: I leave for home tomorrow. Before I leave I could not avoid the temptation of saying my fears are that the Government at Washington are not making those large preparations to attack Fort Pickens, but new Orleans. If so, it strikes me they could do us much damage. Excuse me, I have no doubt you are fully informed about all our weak points. I have the gratest confidence in you as a general and a statesman. I am sure there is no man who wishes you more success than I do. I have no wish for office for myself or friends. You know I have been wholly given to my own affairs.

With the highest respect, I am, dear sir, your friend and humble servant,

THOS G. BLEWETT.
