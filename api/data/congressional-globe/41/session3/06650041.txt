Bureau of Statistics, January 4,1871.
In 3870, the amount received from cotton
mat.atactures of all sorts was $9,000,000.
Fiom pig iron the amount of duty received was
only $1,618,220; from scrap iron the duty
received was only $1,285,000. On manufac-
tures of iron we have the same general class
of figures: a low amount of duties from a large
amount of consumption in the country. The
same is true of steel and its manufactures.
I have here an aggregation of all these
amounts for the past four years. We received
from these duties upon tea, coffee, sugar,
sirup, molasses from sugar cane, tobacco,
spirits and wines, silks and theirmanufactnres,
fruits, cotton manufactures, wool manufac-
tures, iron manufactures, steel manufactures;
we received from those articles during the four
years, a revenue of $502,874,132 28.
From four or five articles, tea, coffee, sugar,
molasses, spirits and wines, tobacco and ci-
gars, &c., we received about eighty-five million
dollars. The exact figures are $84,253,245 01.
That is the amount which we received from
tea, coffee, sugar, sirup, molasses, cigars, to-
bacco, silks, ribbons, dress and piece goods,
and all other manufactures of silks, woods, on
which I have calculated a duty of twenty-five
per cent., yielding $101,000, and which are
now on the free list; but as these woods are
from the tropics and are manufactured into
articles that maybe considered luxuries, being
purchased by the wealthy, they ought to pay
duty as a matter of course. Those articles
would bring us $84,000,000, with duties ad-
justed as they were under the tariff which
existed up to the 1st of January last.
Now, then, if we can raise almost half of
the revenue from these items, why, in the name
of common sense, can you not reduce your
customs revenue when your Treasury is lull to
EDWARD YOUNG, Chief of Bureau.
repletion, when there is, according to the
Secretary's report, an unwieldy and unusually
large balance in the Treasury, when we do not
require to raise from all sources more than
two hundred and fifty or two hundred and
seventy-five million dollars, when we have
adjusted our internal revenue in such a way
that no man complains of its burdens, unless
it may be those who are compelled to pay the
income tax? And, from the position which has
been recently assumed by the Commissioner
of Internal Revenue, we may presume that the
income tax will also soon be wnped out, leav-
ing the excise duties on tobacco and spirits
and stamps, on which you* have raised one
hundred and twenty-five or one hundred and
thirty million .dollars. Why may we not and
can we not reduce the impost revenue to
$125,000,000?
In the course of a year or two, in fconse-
