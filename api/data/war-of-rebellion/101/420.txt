Major LEVERING,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Little Rock:

Nothing later from above. This morning I sent scout to south side of the River to ascertain if the rebels had fallen back; if so, to follow and ascertain by what route, &amp;c. Have sent orders to Captain Hamilton, at Norristown, to cross the River if it is fordable and ascertain if the rebs were going south from Dardanelle; if so, to harass them as much as possible. Raining, with prospect of a rise. This noon sent courier through to General Thayer.

Respectfully,
