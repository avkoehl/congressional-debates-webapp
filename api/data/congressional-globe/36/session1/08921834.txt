THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 23,
,eminent $40,000 duties, and when the tariff was
lowered, they were forced to abandon the wnole .
project, and the machinery, duties, and all, was'a |
total loss. If there was a home demand for the ;
lint, flax would be cultivated for that as well as !
the seed; and our farmers would realize, instead j
of fifteen, forty dollars per acre, or as much as is
obtained in Scotland for the same crop.
While the reciprocity treaty lasts, it is quite im-
material whether any duty is placed upon coal or
not, as it will be imported free of duty from the
British colonies. A duty, however, is" proposed.
It is not irrelevant to say the treaty alluded to has
proved most disastrous to many other American
interests; and having been made, as I conceive,
by a relaxation of the constitutional rights of this
House, which has the sole right to originate rev-
enue bills, it ought to be speedily terminated.
It is also proposed to limit the time for ware-
housing goods to thirty days. It would bo diffi-
cult to show why we should give merchants, who
choose to withdraw their goods from market for
the purpose of obtaining better prices, a credit
upon duties rather than those who enter them at
once for consumption as soon as landed, or why
they should be furnished with stores by Govern-
ment, from which to peddle their commodities.
To our merchants it can be of little advantage, as
they import goods such as they need to sell, not
to hold for a speculative market. Our whole policy
seems unwearied in behalf of interests which an-
tagonize our own. Sixty-nine per cent, of the
importing business of New York is asserted to be
in the hands if foreigners. It is time to curtail
the business of renting stores on the part of Gov-
ernment. If foreign manufacturers or shippers
avail themselves of our market to dispose of sur-
plus stocks, they should have no power not prac-
tically enjoyed by Americans, and the power of
warehousing is oraclically a foreign convenience,
useful to forcigirshipping and disastrous alike to
our own trade and manufactures.
Among the results to be looked for, should
this bill pass, it may be confidently asserted that,
if it should not diminish, it will not increase the
expense of collecting the revenue. Upon a very
considerable share of the importations the duties
will be specific, and as in such cases they will
require only to bo weighed or measured, the forces
ofthecustom-house can be reduced. Then a num-
ber of minor articles from which the revenue is
inconsiderable, but which will be of no small ad-
vantage to a great diversity of manufacturer, aie
placed upon the free list, and will merely require
to be properly registered. In regard to thoss' ar-
ticles upon which mixed or compound duties nro I
proposed, that is. in part specific and in part ad I
valorem, there will be no difficulty, if merely com- |
potent men rather than political partisans arc em- !
ployed; for, mold your laws into whatever shape |
you please, the trado possess a wonderful nimble- i
riess as well as sagacity in adapting their orders I
and shipments to new statutes. I have no ques-
tion but an Administration desirous of reducing
the expenses of collecting the revenue would find
no obstacles under this bill.
It may be said that some of the details of the
bill aie complex, but those who will feel the live-
liest interest in this objection will be those who
foresee in the complexity an impediment to eva-
sions.
I have thus given such explanations of the bill
as I could pack in the hour allotted; very imper-
fectly it is tiue, but enough to give a general idea
of its leading points. That it is perfect—to the dot-
ting of an i or the crossing of a t—I would not
pretend; but it may be claimed to be free of some
imperfections and anomalies of the present law.
Should it be adopted, it will at least sustain ihe
Government, and pay off the public debt. It will
also put now life into all branchesol'industry, and
set the plow, the loom, and the anvil, at work
throughout the whole length and breadth of the
Republic. Napoleon had aniaxim—"Nothingby
the people; everything for the people"—which we
seeia to have reversed. Everything by the people,
nothing for the people, might be called the Ameri-
can motto. For once, in taking care of the Gov-
ernment, let us allow to the people some consid-
eration and some incidental benefit.
I shall ask leave of the committee to print several
tables, which I have prepared to sustain the facts
stated, and which may be of some use to others.
