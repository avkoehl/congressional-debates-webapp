officers I have not disapproved of it, though in my own opinion too much ammunition has been expended to reach the result sought. I have no report from the batteries of the department not serving with this army, and have no knowledge of what or in how many actions they have participated.

I have adopted a system of special inspections by field officers assigned to that duty, and by which means I shall become conversant with the condition of all the batteries i the department. The chiefs of artillery of the different corps have my hearty thanks for the willingness and earnest co-operation with me in all my views regarding the management of the artillery, and too much praise cannot be given to the officers and men of the batteries for the their great bravery, efficiency, and personal gallantry.

I am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. W. OSBORN,

Major First New York Artillery and Chief of Artillery, Department and Army of the Tennessee.
