Major JOSEPH DARR, Jr.,

Provost-Marshal-General, Wheeling, Va.

MAJOR: An exchange of prisoners of war is expected to take place immediately, and for this purpose I wish you to have prepared immediately rolls of all military prisoners held in the Middle Department, including those on parole. Make out a roll of those belonging to no military organizations, though taken in arms. Whenever petitions for release or parole are presenter please let it appear distinctly whether the person is a soldier or only partly military.

I have not yet received any instructions in relation to the exchange and do not know when or how it will take place.

I hope this is not the case. I must call your attention to my instructions of the 24th and 26th of May and I require you to be governed by them strictly. I give you no discretion to deviate from them. If there should be occasion to [do so] if should be referred to me. They are permitted to walk outside [the fort] not more than three days a week,
