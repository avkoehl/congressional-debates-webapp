MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., April 4, 1863-2.20 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Colonel Harrison, of the Thirty-ninth Indiana, has 200 men at Indianapolis ready to come to me. Can you not give Governor Morton 200 Sharps' breech-loading carbines to arm these men, that they may act as guards to boats coming up the river?

Major-General.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., April 4, 1863-7.45 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Only military movements known of rebels yesterday was raid on our transportation at Palmyra and firing on boat at Harpeth Shoals. NO boats captured or lost. Have an expedition of cavalry and infantry after Morgan, toward Smithville. May go to McMinnville. Been out three days. Propose to send 1,500 men, under an able officer, to go to Eastport, joined by two brigades from Corinth, to capture Tuscumbia, cover my party, and cut and destroy the Georgia Railroad. Have telegraphed Hurlbut to know if he will co-operate. General Dodge reports rebels working roads north from Florence and east from Savannah. Says rebels are operating for supplies. My great difficulty is to get horses. When I can mass a mounted force to destroy their cavalry, I shall be ready to march. Troops in fine condition.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

(For Gov. Andrew Johnson.)

From letters from the War Department, there seems to be an impression that there has been some conflict between your authority and the military power here. You know very well how often I have assured you I would do all I could to build up and support civil authority, and aid you in every way in my power. Please communicate to me fully and freely all matters of conflict and complaint, and be assured I will rectify, or show you decisive public reasons for not doing so.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Please open and communicate, if Governor Johnson is not in Washington.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
