KNOXVILLE, April 25, 1865-9 p.m.

Major-General THOMAS:

In obedience to your instructions per telegraph received yesterday, I at once sent instructions to General Gillem, or in case he availed himself of the leave granted him, to Colonel Palmer, who by the way is a most excellent officer, to concentrate the cavalry, to destroy Charlotte and then push north, destroying everything in the shape of supplies for Johnston's army, and if possible destroy Greensborough, to act with the utmost vigor, and to co-operate with General Sherman in bringing Johnston to better terms. I have sent the Ninth Tennessee Cavalry to scout the country between the Holston and Cumberland Mountains. In that region there are still two guerrilla parties reported. Had given instructions to take no prisoners. Bartlett's Second North Carolina is ordered into the mountain region east of here with orders to scour that region as far as the Georgia line, and Kirk's Third North Carolina is to perform the same duty north of the French Broad.
