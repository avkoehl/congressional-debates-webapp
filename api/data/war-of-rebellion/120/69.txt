Major General JOHN A. DIX,

Commanding Department of the East, New York:

GENERAL: This Department sees no objections to Messrs. Palmer &amp; Co. furnishing wooden legs to the rebels that need them. You will indicate to Palmer & Co. the Department's approval of their course in submitting the question to your judgment before acting upon it as a course proper to be pursued by loyal and patriotic men.

Your obedient servant,

FORT MONROE, VA., April 19, 1864-10. 40 a. m.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

The Express and New York are at Baltimore, having just landed the sick and wounded prisoners from Richmond. They are fully fitted up as hospital boats, and I would suggest the return by them of all sick and wounded Confederates we have either at Fort Delaware, Baltimore, or Washington.

Please telegraph me if this disposition is acceded to and order forward the sick. The Express could go to Fort Delaware if needed.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 19, 1864.

Major General B. F. BUTLER,

Commissioner for Exchange, Fort Monroe, Va.:

Please inform me if all the invalid Federal prisoners and men who were prisoners in Richmond have been delivered.

W. HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners.

FORT MONROE, April 19, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

Telegram received. All the invalids have not been delivered, but all have been delivered who could be taken with comfort to themselves aboard the hospital boats. It being expensive to fit up hospital boats, I am desirous of finishing the transportation of all invalids both ways irrespective of other questions of exchange.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

Approved by Secretary War April 20, 1864.
