MAHONE'S BRIGADE, ANDERSON'S DIVISION,

May 14, 1863.

MAJOR: In response to the circular from headquarters First Army Corps, May 12, I beg leave to report the capture of the colors of the One hundred and seventh Ohio Volunteers:

This standard (a most highly finished flag) was taken, with the colorbearer and prisoners from four different regiments, from the rifle-pits of the enemy at Chancellorsville, on the left of the Plank road, by a gallant charge made by only three companies of the Sixth Virginia Infantry (Colonel [George T.] Rogers), under the immediate command of Captain W. Carter Williams. The charge was made a little after dark, when Captain Williams, commanding the advance line of skirmishers covering the brigade, was directed to feel the enemy warmly, in order mainly that his attention might be seriously occupied while Lieutenant-General Jackson was pressing him upon his flank and rear, and it was made over a difficult abatis, and the enemy fired upon and driven for the moment from his intrenchments. The standards was delivered immediately to General Lee, whose headquarters were near by, and under whose more immediate direction I was for the time acting.

It is deeply to be regretted that Captain Williams, whose gallantry on this occasion was conspicuous, fell the next morning mortally wounded, while skirmishing with the enemy on the same line.

I am, major, very respectfully,

WM. MAHONE,

Brigadier-General.

Major THOMAS S. MILLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Anderson's Division.
