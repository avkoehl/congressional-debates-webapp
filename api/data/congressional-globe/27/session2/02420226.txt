He (Mr I*) had a word to say to the gentleman from Penn-  j
eylvama, [Mr Bhown 1   Mr P thoughuhatthe gentleman was
in error in not immediately" coming forward and seconding in-
vestigation mio all the affairs of lhi& Government,                          j
Mi BROWN (Mr P yielding for the purpose) explained
He siid he would vote for as many committees of investigation
as a-nv gentleman, but he was not willing to pay too dear lor the
whistle Ho did not wish, to pay extra for these things, he
■wished fo get them for the $3 per diem made to members of
Congress
Mi PROFFÍT resumed. He accepted the gentleman's ex
planation The gentleman thought that the committee were
competent themselves to do this duty. But the committee s nd
they were not, and he (Mr. P ) was willing to take their woid
What would lie the consequence of the refusal to employ a
clerk' The committee would say that they had been prevented
making exposures for the want of a clerk Now, he was for
letting alt the expenditures of the Government be made
known to the country. It was the policy of the party
whirh had lately been defeated before the people, to adopt
that course.
Mr P expressed himself will rig not only to vote foi giv n<?
a clei k to this c jmmittee, but was willing to give a clerk to any
committee which might aid m laying before the countiy
the expenditures of the Government honestly and m gooo
faith *
Mr LEWIS WILLIAMS said, thathe was opposed in general
to allowing cleiks to standing committees, and he had um
ioimly voted againstthem The difference in the presentca^e
was this ¡Stanlmg committees had no journals to keep, they
made their repotts to the House, which were filed by the Clerk,
and in the lecess were recorded m a bound book But if
was a diffeient thing with Committees of Investigation They
must keep journals of all their proceedings, they must record
testimony, and this he knew, by experience, could not be
done Without a cle'k While, therefore, he wo ild deny a
derk to a standing committee, he thought it was due to the
gentleman fiom North Carolina, [Mr Stanly,) due to
ibe "louse, and due to the committee, that they should have a
clerk.
ftlr GILMER presumed that the gentleman fiom Pennsylva-
nia alluded to the committee that was raised last session, under
the resolution thu he offered to the House lie would state to
the gentleman that that committee still existed—that it was pro
guying slowly though he trusted surely, m the accomplish
ment of borne ot the objects for which it was created It would
be lemembered that at the extra action a proposition was
made to the House asking leave lor the committee to tit foi a
shoit time during the recess, an 1 foi powei to send for pei&ona
on i pipers, but the House did not see fit to accede to thepropo
mtion.
Had the IIous" given the power asked for, it would have en
abled the committee to elicit a vait deal of impoitant nfoi ma

So the resolution was adopted
GENERM APPROPRIATION BILL
On motion ofMr FILLMORE,theHoui>eagainíesolved itself
into Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr
Briggs of Mas=arhu=e«s in the chan,) and resumed the coosi-
deiation of the bill making appropriations for the civil and dipio
matic expenses of the Government for the year 1842
The reading of the bill by clauses was then commerced, and
the firstclause was read, as follows
"For pay and mileage of the members of Consiess and l)e
legates from the lerntoiies, in addition to the sum alie^dy
appropriated to that object, dmmg the pie->ent sesaio i,
$273,712 
Mr GILMER asked if this was the last leading tl e bill would
receive He contemplated offering various amendments, but
was not piepared with thtm now lie did not wv^h todda n
the committee, but if no othei gentleman was leady, as there
wa* mucfi other business, he would bugged the pmpnety of
laving tht bill aside till to moirow, oi that the chirman of the
Cnmmi tee of Ways and Means fix some day for its considei a
tion
Mr riLLMOREsaid he<=houldbe verry happy toaccommo
date the gentleman from Virginia, ifitw s possible to assign a
day when the b II might be considered, but the gentleman was
too well acquainted wnh pioceedings of this Hm^e to think
for a moment that it waa posftible to deteimine m advuice any
thing done here It was of vast impértante thatth's bill should
be immediately oc'ed on, and he hoped the gentleman would
not move to postpo ie it
Mr GILMCR said if it would be corrpetent for him to offer
amendments ifter the bill had been gone through, he had no
objection to now proceeding with it
The CHAIRMAN said that as he nndrr tood, rf ei the bill
had been gon° thiough, amendments could be received
The first clause as given above, was then passed.
The second clause wah then read, asfoilow
"Tor pay of he officers and clerks of the Senate and House
of Representatives m addition to the sum aheajjy appropi 'ated
to that obiert during the present^ession, twelve thousand five
hundred dollars "                                              .
Mr CUbHlNG moved to amerldthis claiw? by striking out
"twelve1' and inseumg ' fifleen," o as to rd*d fifteen thousand
five hundred dollars He s nd helfound byáhe report submit
ted by the committee that appropriations fad been heretofoie
made without the authority of law, and/when they had been
CO'itinued in previous bills, they had lijptrtei? them m this to
save another bill upon the subject ijo th¿ amount of ^^2,000

fact, and also that the committee hafl omitted find u pppir

making the recommendations theyhdlirade and in om ftin^
apprcpnations which they had omitted    It appeared m the reJ
poit, from their investigation, n was discovered, that since
about 1836 [arse applanations had been made for officers—
part in the two Houses of Congiess, and others m the Depart-
ments—and commued lrom year to year without authority of
law.
The question then piesenteí itself to the committee whether
thiy should continue these apprupna ions without bringing the
fact to the knowledge of the Ho\.se or at once strike them out,
and ask to repcrt a bill legalizing such of them as were neces-
sary Knuwng the extieme uncertainty oi e^ery thing m this
House, and the possibility, if these ofhceis were deprived of
the  sppiopnafionsm this bill that the o her ball would not
p9ss. the committee had come to the conclusion that the safest
course would be to follow the precedents so far as to report
these api íopnations, leaving to the Houms to dispose of them
as they thought proper
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Cushing] had called
the attention of the Hou>e to the iule reemnn g that thfese ap
propnatione ^houli be fn* objects authorized by law, except
m two specific ceses Had this rule been followed for six
oi seven year^pa=¡t they would no* have hdd tl e difficulty now
pusentmg itself faese ofhceis wou'd euhei have been pio-
vided for by law, or appropriations would not have been made
foi them The committee discovered that several clerks in
both Houses of Consrebb were employed unler resolution of
the respective Houees, and the question arose whether the re-
solution of either House was the authority of law Certainly
the action of either body separate was no law But thebe clerks
hadheen employed by resolution*, of the two Houses,and con-
tinued foi s* veial years, and seemed to have the sanction of the
House employing them, therefoie tí ev lad hougl t it was pro-
per l) piovide for thtm, and to piovide th t hereafter, aato the
contingent fund, no appropriation sbuuldbe made unless lega-
lized by law or resolution
Iheieweie two clerks emploved in this ITou eon the mera

This was anew case entiiely The question with the commit-
tee had been, wheiherthey shouldsu I 20 on, and appiopnate
for clerksmeie y employed by the Clciktf the House without
ihe authority of rI e Hou«e The comnu've came to the con-
elusion th a* thsy ought not, that if the House requited the ser-
vices of these two clerks, as they weieinUiutd to think they
did, it was a proper question to submit to the House And if
the House thoughtthey were necessary, th"y had only to say so
by resolution, and ample pro\i^ion was made loi them in the
contingent fund foi, fy the piovi-sion annexed to the con
tinsent funr1 of the House, cleiks empioved by the oidcr of
the House were to be paid fiom it Thev thought that neither
