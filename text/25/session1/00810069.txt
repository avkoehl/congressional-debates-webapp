The journal, how ever, would show whatcouise it

pi ict ce of the House to refei subjects of this '

ihe peculiar situation of the public b ismess should,

Mi WILLIAMS, of North Carolina, believed

ot INei'land and Graham had been consideied m
the House, but he consideied hVse to be subjects
of too gieat importance to be disposed of in that
waj, and he wished to be allowed to say to the

consideied this subject one oí mfmitih moic m-

due to the nation, that this subject should be re

M HAYNES would merely sav, in ans« er to
the gentleman, if it was exported that this question
would rceue moie ample discussion than what
took place in the case of the IS or h Carolina con-

the} could collect, to lay before ths House, but this
w as an exception to the general rule, there being

who are of opinion tint fhese two gent'emen are
not cmsiitution^llv t'ected, will have the oppor-
