Should that answer be unpropiuous, which Heaven lorhid, we

Mr LI UPKIN hav ing ad eeted 10 the mod (nation of tus re

Mr ALLEN said he would vote against the resolunon under
eon*ider uo 1. or any other proposing to fix a day lor the ad

receipt of important intelligence trom Greet Britain asequiva
lent 10 adeclaration that we deemed the anticipated answer of
the British Government as of no moment, whereas ihat answer
might involve us in the m ei serious difficulties with that
power
Mr, BENTON said he was opposed to acting on this ques-
tion of adjournment at ihe present tune H- wasoneol those
who anxiously desired peace-—peace withall nati >ns, bu he was
also of opinion, that to preserve peace we should show to the
world that we were prepared to defend ourselves \nd he w is
also of opinion that the manner in which we had squandered
the public money among the several Stales, ha I encouraged a
foreign nation lo push us to a point Our immense frontier,
embracing an extent of not less than six thousand miles, as is
generally known, is in aa defenceless a condition as could be
wished by an enemy It was even, in some resperts,
in a worse situation than at the commencement ot
th  last war with Great Britain To be sure, we
had some fortification1", but many ol them were
without armaments, and defenceless, and could be taken pos
sesei in of by an enemy, and m id a means of annoyance to us,
instead of defence They would be turned against us, instead
of being useful against our enemies Tne 8 na e some days
since passed a resolution which was offered b> the Senator I rom
Michigan, [Mr Norvell ] calling on the Secretarv of \\ ar lor
such information as he possessed re'ative to warlike pre
para ions by a neighboring nation on the Noithern and
N .rtheaatem frontier The reply to that resolution
has not yet been received, but every Senate r is aware
that ex ensive preparations are going on alonar the whole
line of oar Northern frontier—from Lake Super or to Passarr*-

colleague [Mr Lrvs] so appropnately and persevenngly en
deavors to turn our attention t > Not only to the mouth ol that
important nver, but to the Bermudas, may our attention be
turned to the warlike preparation  that are being made We
can also point to the Bahamas—to the greatly lne reased facility
of communication between Great Britain and Halifax—to the
concentration of troops in provinces bordenr gon our fron íer
all exhibited evidences of preparing for a state of hostilities
Mr President, it is time that we cease plundering our coun
try, and begin to defend it The miserable business of dividing
surplus revenue and land revenue, should be scouted from our
councils The armor of defence is what the nation should
wear If we wish lo preserve peace, we must show a will tore
sist aggression The nation which reruses to defend itself in
vites aggression The dark clouds are gathering around ns We
see them far above the horizon, North, South, East and West
Great Britain prepares at all point , we remain supine, Con
eress remains supine All the admonitions of the late and pre sent
Admimstra'ionsto prepare in peace for war, have been disre
garded, and now we ar:: taunted with our defenceless state At 1 he

time, impending events may require accelerated anion and he
was not f r adjourning, or even discussing the question of ad
j mrnment, until these events were further developed While
the question with England wore its present aspect, he deemed
it neither wise nor politic to discuss an a Ijournment It would
look like saying we would do nothing to defen 1 our-elves, and
thereby would encourage and embolden the rower whose pre
parations now mpnace us It would operate asan encourage
ment to Great Britain to continue to t ush us—to continue to
press and bear upon us, and from that pressure, en lisian and
explosion might ensue He was for deferring the question of
adjournment until the public business was attended to, an I es
penally urtil thequpstmn with England changed its a«pprt
Mr TAPPAN moved that the reso ution be laid upon the ta
ble, but withdrew it at the request of
Mr NORVIIL, who wished to be informed by the chair
man of the f nmmittee on Military Affairs, whp'her it was the
intention of the committee lo report, at aday not very remote, a
bill for the def nee of ihe rountry
Mr BENTON ml an answer to this question was intended in
his previous re marks The committee h id lelRve 1 their anion,
until a report from one of the Departments, which wa- expect
ed atan early day sh mid be rei eived
After some remarks from Mr   PRENTISS in favor of the
resolution
Mr JJNN said, a* hw constituents hal a right to know 1 js

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES,
Tuesdav, Mart h 31   l'UO
After an ineffectual attempt on the [art of Mr Bmrcs fo
amend the journal,
Mr ADAMS rose and said that he had a request to make of
the Houie in consequence ofa letter which he received vester
dav from (heSecre'aty of the Treasury The letter was short
and he des led thatit might beread as the Houce would then tie
the better enab'ed to understand and judge of the propriety ol
the requ st lie w ts about to make
The letter was then read
Mr ADAMS then observed that the bill referred to in the let
ter of the "secretary was reponed by the Committee on Manu
factures on the 5 h Match last [No 1(X) ] to insure the more
faithful execution of the I iws in re'ation in the collection of
duties on imports The object was to suppress arid prevent
some of those numerous frauds on the revenue of which theie
had been so much complaint, and with which the Adminis ra
Hon of the Government had so much cause to be diss-itt fieri
He di 1 ask the House, at the lime he reported this hill to make
it the special order for some ceitain thv This the House did
not thn k pi oper then to grant He now took the first moment
after rece ving die letter of the Seciptary of the Treasury, to
make the same request, and he would propose to make the bill
the special order for this day fortnight, to take precedence over
all other husinSMi
Mr POPE suggested whether it would not be belter for the
gentleman to fix on some earlier day
Mr ADAMS replied that it wi tild be more agreeable to
him to fix on this «"ay week, if such was t' e pleasure of the
House
Mr CONNER would suggest to the gentleman from Maspa
chnsetn to except the appropnation bills in giving this bill the
precedence over all other business All hough he i 'mined that
this was an important measure yet it was not more so iban the
bills providing for arrvmgon the opprttions of the Govern
ment, and should not take precedence ovtr them The chair
man of the Committee of Ways and Means, he understood ir
tended to ask the House to take up the civil and diplomatic ap
propnation bill to day,and it was veiy well known that appro
priaitons for thi  branch of the public service was now wanted,
and that the claims of some individuals had even been pro
tested
Mr RHETT urged the great necessity of acting on the navy
appropriation bill
Mr ADAMS objected lo exciptinethe appropriation 1 ills,
because it was known to all that when they came up, they
generally gave rise to debates lasting three or four weeks He
wished to state that he made his motion in consiqupnce of the
letter of Ihe Secretary of the Treasury and from a sincere de-
sire to accommodate those who have the adir inistrat on of the
affairs of thecountry, in relation to the execution of their ip
propriate duties and more especially in relition to the raising
ofa certain revenue for the wants of the Government He was
perfectly willing to take tins day week, and that would give
time enough to enable the chairman of the Committee of Ways
and Meanstobrirgup the appropriation bills
Mr CONNER moved to imend the motion of the gentleman
from Massachusetts by adding the words ' wi h the exception
of the appropriation bills, ' the effect of the amendment b mg
to give Ihe bill the preference over all other business with (1 e
exception of ippropnatnm hi Is
Mr I VI RETT inquired o' the gentleman from Massachu
set  whether, in his opinion, the bill wood give rise to debate''
Mr ADAMSapprehended that a hill of this importance con'd
not pass without some dtsruussion With respect to the
amendment of the gentleman from North < arolma, if it should
be the pleasure House to pass it. he would acquiesce, but he
apprehended that it would virtually defeat the proposition, for
if the appropriation bills wer* once taken up, a debate of per-
haps weeks would ensue, and (he objects of the Administration
in regard to this lull would be defeated    Such should not be
the case w ith his consent

to him Up I as since read the speech of the gentleman as re

guage re| oited in the Glube, but nothing to which Mr T has
any right to take exception Mr T was glad it was so The
mtssta ement is the act, not of the gentleman from Ohio, but of
one ol the Reporters on Ihat bench—no. not Reporters, but ha
bilual fa sifiers of the debates in this House
Mr DI NCAN said the gentleman was rather too harsh upon
the reporters He may have used some such expressions, but
if he did tliey were so qualified as to make them unexception-
able

if the gentltman hal used that language!
