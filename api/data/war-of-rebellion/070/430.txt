HEADQUARTERS, Harper's Ferry, May 11, 1864.

General KELLEY,Cumberland:

I am just informed by telegraph from Baltimore that a large force under Rosser and Imboden is at Romney, threatening the road at Green Spring. Have you this information, and is the force with you strong enough? Please answer immediately.

MAX WEBER,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to Colonel Wilkinson, New Creek.)

CUMBERLAND, May 11, 1864.

Brigadier-General WEBER:

By some oversight I neglected to advise you of our trouble yesterday morning. A cavalry force of about 5000 men sent by General Sigel to Moorefield was attacked by an overwhelming force under Rosser and Imboden near Wardensville and driven through Romney and Springfield to Green Spring, where they crossed the river. They are falling back on me, being out of ammunition, rations, and forage. They lost their train and about 50 men killed, wounded, and missing.

Rosser and Imboden were reported in Romney this a. m., with a force of cavalry, mounted infantry, and artillery, thought to be between 1,000 and 2,000. My scouts report to-day that they encountered their pickets at the Wire Bridge, between Springfield and Romney.

If I am not attacked to-morrow morning I think they will fall back or go round me and go west of the mountain into West Virginia. No force sent by you could reach me in time. I think I can take care of myself.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

Cavalry were sent in pursuit and recaptured the horses and one man near Smithfield. All quiet. Colonel Rodgers reports that his cavalry have been ordered to Front Royal. He has orders to allow none to move without orders from Generals Sigel or Stahel, they having placed them there.
