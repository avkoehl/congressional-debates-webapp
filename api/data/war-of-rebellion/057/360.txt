sent Ferguson to cover his front and the Mobile and Ohio Railroad. This was sent from Smith's Ferry when he should have known more of enemy than myself. Will keep office open all night. Enemy's cavalry have left Lake in direction of Hillsborough.

Colonel Maxwell, commanding regiment of cavalry, reports from near Decatur at 5 p.m. that the enemy crossed at creek where bridge was burned about 10 a.m. to-day, and will encamp 4 miles west of Decatur to-night. General Loring reports having trouble with the roads, and as having been delayed by them. Scouts report the enemy's scouts 6 miles west of Decatur, on the Hillsborough road.

The following is the note of Colonel Maxwell:
HEADQUARTERS BALLENTINE'S REGIMENT CAVALRY,Four and a half Miles East of Decatur-5 p.m.

Since writing to General Loring this morning I find that the enemy are still advancing on this road. They will encamp to-night about 4 miles west of Decatur. I was led to believe this morning that they had left this road, as my scouts went to the creek where they came to on yesterday and found none at that point, and so reported to me. After remaining there some time, the enemy made their appearance and commenced crossing (this creek is some 13 miles from Decatur) about 10 a.m. to-day.

Yours of 10 p.m. received. Adams' brigade is here. Starke's brigade 4 miles from here, south. Ferguson is now in front of enemy on Decatur road. Have not heard from Ross since sending my order for him to join me. Expect him in about three days. Your order me to concentrate my command. Did you intend me to order Ferguson from where he is? I presume you did not and will not order him till I hear from you. The other two brigades are together, or only a few miles apart. I need about 300 horses for dismounted men; 200 were killed in recent fights. Some dismounted men are with train at or near Meridian. Waties' battery needs 100 horses badly to mount his men and replace broken-down horses. He needs forty saddles, bridles, &amp;c. Colonel Perrin, with Ferguson, has no cartridge-boxes. Please answer as to horses and as to Ferguson leaving his position and joining me.

Have ordered Waties' battery to Enterprise, as horses and men are broken down. Please send horses for him there. I move on
