United States navy     The bill was read twice, and referred
to the Committee on the Library
Mr LINN offered the following resolution
Hesolved, That, in addition to the distribution already made,
the Surveyors General of the pubrn, lands of the United States,
and the recorder of land titles at Si Lour, Missouri, shall tach
be supplied, foi the use of his office, with one copy, consist
ma of five volumes, of the reports and documents relating to
public lands and private land claims, printed by order of the
Senate, and with one copy of the laws and opinions, punted
underthe resolution of the Serateof the 28 h February, 1837.
Mr KING desired to know if these books were m the pus
session of the Secretary of the Senate
Mr LINN replied that he understood they were
Mr SMITH of Indiana observed that it would be proper to
make some disposition of the books, if there was a surplus
of them    A question might arise, ho wevei, whether the distri
bution of a part oí them, now proposed, might not be a partial
one
Mr LINN obseived that the resolution applied to all the
eurveyorsgeneral,butonly to one recorder of land titles—that
m Missouri. He did not know of any other recoider with n the
United States wanting the books, if there was, it could have
been made to apply to him
Mr BENTON asked and obtained leave to introduce a bi'l
to piovide foi the armed occupation and settlement of the un
settled part of East Florida, which was read twice, and refer
red to the Committee on Military Affairs
Mr BATES presented the memonal of Henry Newman,
which was referred to the Committee on Public Lands
The general orders were then taken up, and the bill for the
relief of the heirs of Archibald Parker, deceased, was read a
third time and passed
The Senate bill, No 150 being next in order,
Mr SMITH of Indiana observed that a bill from the House
had been reported to the Senate, which was the same in sub
stance and object as the Senate bill No 150, and therefore, as
the shortest mode of disposing of the matter, he would move to
postpone the general orders for the purpose of taking up the
House bill No 55—that to which he had aliuded
And the Senate having agreed to postpone the general ordets
for" that purpose, the House b II No 55, for the relief of the
heirs of Brigadier General Armand, Major General Duportail,
and Major dela Colombe, officeiain the annyof the Rev lu
tion, was taken up, asm committee of the whole
Mr KING obses ved that he would like to know something of
the nature of this claim
Mr SMITH of Indiana explained that the-,e gentlemen were
officers in the army of the Revolution, who hadiemained in the
service of the United Sta e^ till the close of the war, ard were
entitled to bounty land, but the cldim of their heir3 not having
been made til! 1840 when the lands  appropriated as bounty
lands for soldiers of th*1 Revolution had been all deposed of,
no warrants could be issued, and the pre ent bill was to pro
vide either for the issue of wai rants to select landg, or the issue
of scrip He did not care which plan was adopted, if the issue
of scrip was authorized, he was satisfied with the billas it came
from the House, if that was not concurred in, he would offer
an amendment to make the mode of "selection mure specific
Mr KING was not aware that scrip had ever been issued
for bounty land tosoldiers of the Revolution, except in the m
etance of the Vngima line, and all knew what frauds and im
positions that gave rise to
Mr SMITH said scup had been frequently issued, accord
ing to his retullection, in other instances    He would suggest
the propriety of having the report read ,which accompanied the
bill
The report was then read
Mr KI\G hoped the chairman of the Committee on Public
Lands would so amend the bill a& to confine it to the issuing of
warrants
Mr SMITH said he had no objection He offered an amend-
ment to that effect, which wats adopted
Mr WRIGHT observed that he did not very well understand
the merits of the claim But it stiuck him with surprise that
the information fiom one of the departments, contained m the
report just read, should have been furnished in this case, and
denied mothers He had applied forinfoimationof the kind at
the same department lately, and was told it could not be given,
nor could mqumee be answered till the general bill before Con
gress on the subject was passed He thought these cases might
lie over for the general bill too
Mr SMITH explained that the information from the de
paitment alluded to was siven four or five years ago—before
the rule wag adopted by which the Senator had been denied the
information which he wanted
Mr McROBERTS called attention to the great length of time
which had elapsed befoie the claim was made
Mr. SMITH observed that he did not considei there was any
limitation of time to such claims for bounty lands
Mr WRIGHT suppospd, from the names, that these weie
French officers If they were entitled to bounty land?, who
makes the claim/ irdwhataie the rights of the claimants'* were
questions which demanded some deliberation
Mr TAPPAN observed that if the lineal hens of those indi
viduals were to come forwaid and make the claim, he should
be very much disponed to auxnd it to them , but he comd not
see the propriety of making the grant to distant relations oi
collateral claimants He would move to recommit the bill to
the Commute on Involutional y Claims
Mr 3MIIH replied at con i leiuble length, and wentm'oa

Mr LINN observed thai it had been agreed upon, on batiu
day, that the Senate would resume executive session to day at
3 o'clock, but it was not yet that hour, and, before it arrived,
some progress could be made in the unfinished business
Mr MANGUM sq.id thert was very important business tobe
transacted in executive session besides that which it hod been
agroedshould be resumed at 3 o'clock. He could not, there*
foie, «suspend his motion
A division on the question was called for, and resulted—

So ihe Senate went into executive session, and, after some
hours spent therein, adjourned.

Mi HOPKINS susgtibied the propriety of referring the r eso
lution to a committee, with instruction  to inquire into its pro

Aftei a few woids fiom Mr MERIWETHER and Mr HOP
KINS, the resolution was modified as Mr H >i?kins eugees'ed,
an 1 in that shape it was adopted
Several gentlemen being about to offer memorials and reso
Unions—
Mr MORGAN who had a resolution which he desired to
submit, inquired}'thib was not resolution dav, and, on being
answered in the affirmative, said he should object to the uregu
lar presentation of resolutions, and moved that the States be
called forresolntions in order
The SPEAKER remarked that the business in order would
be the unfinished business of Suurday, viz the revoluti in of
the gentleman from Kentucky, [Mr Garrett Davis,] which
was as follows
Resolved, That a committee of five be appointed to inquire
into the cause manner, and circumstances of the removal of
Henry H Svlvester, late a clerk in the Pension Office, from bis

otheiwise.
Mr G DAVIS now moved the previous question
Mr WELt ER saii the resolution was objected to on itspre
sen canon on Saturday and he wished to know, theiefore, how
it now came up as unfinished bu&mess
The SPEAKER informed the gentleman that the resolution
was received on Saturday, and he was m enoi in supposing
that it was objected to
Mr W W IRWIN said it was the impression  of many
members in his vicinity that it was objected to
The House sustained the motion for the previous question
Mr W W IRWIN moved to lay the resolution on the table
Mr G DaVIS called for the yeas and nays which were or
dered and the motion to lay the resolution on the table was neg-
atived—yeas 51, nays 97    The resolution was then adopted
Mr SI UART of Illinois wished to precent to the House a

Mr PROFFIT objected, but after some irregulai^iscue&ion,
the letter was received, and was ordered to be printed
Mr MORGAN again called for the crders of theday
Mr LEVY then proceeded to address the House   ihe ques
tion being on the motion to refer the said message to the Com
mittee on the Territories and that it be primed
Mr Levy thanked the Housa fonts kn dness m consenting

could not however, reconcile it to his «¡en^e of duty to allow

So far as the legislation suggested was concerned it was well
enough He not only did not object 'o this part of it, buth id

I cannot be iar wrong when I avow the belief that the sole
object of the message was to sound a sort of grand üouri$b be

The message certainly cou'd not have bern intended merely
for the purpose of suggesting legislation, foi the Wai Depart-
ment had some time before officially corrrmumc.ited us views to

ply to a letter addie&.ed tothe" ect,clny upon iae subject, and
in that communication had suggested fuilv all that the presenf

Clerk to read the letter.
War Department, April 26,1842
Sir In answer to your letlei of the 26th met received ta-
day, I would say that, in my opinion the occupation of the
peninsula of Honda by a hardy u d armed body of men would
be the most effectual means of prtveuirg anyhosti'e incur-
sions by the Indians 1 heir number is now so much reduced,
that the trouble and expense of keeping a large military es-
tablishment there, for the pursuit an lea tmeof the few that
remain, seem no longer expedient A lore* ten times the num-
ber now m the field of thot-e would not pieyent occasional ir-
ruptions of the Indians, and, if it can be prevented by any
means, that above suggested appears the most effectual And
if, to securesuch settlements it he necessary to offer a quarter
section of land to eauh head of a family,! should think it judi-
cious to make the offer, but with the express declaration that
the title of the United States only would be granted, and that the
Government would not be íefcpons ble for anyfai'ure of tuie.
It might also be expedient to authouze the issue of rations to
the families of such settlors as were m uted of them foraierm
not exceeding one year, and the loan of arms, on security being
given, or some provision made, to secure their return at some
specified time.
Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
J  C SPENCER
The purpose of the message, then, could not have been
merely to suggest the plan of settlement, that had been aheady
fully suggested in the Secretary's lettpi ju->t read, daudApnl
2bth a fortnight before the date < f the message
The only other purpose conceivable wis that of enjoying,
with fatal precipitancv thehonoi of declaring thf wai closed
And by what means la thit, end reached 1 Why, sir, by aa
vntual abandonment of all we have bee i thus far contending"
for At first I had thought that the news of the surrender of
Hal leek I u«tenuesee ard twenty six ot hia warriors, which
reached us about tne date of the message had induced this new
movement and that in the exulta ion of the moment, the war
had indeed been thought endul But it became evident to me*
upon reading the insuuctiun1- ot the Secretary to the com-
manding geneial, wnli the note appended to it m the Madi-
sonian, that such wat, not the case ihe ins ructions afid the
message had evidently foi then ba*n a recommendation of
Col Worth, dated 14th Pebruaiy la¡-.t Now it is not a little
remarkable that the&e very ptopositionsof Col Worth, if I am
not mistaken, weie made the sublet of a gcave military con-
sultation at the time and were deliberately íejected, and he
was ordered to prosecute hostilities till the subjugation of the
enemy Such is the information which I leceivtdat the time.
Why, then, this change of put pose 1 Hud the aspect of affairs
changed? Tvotatall for the better, but in trmh for the worse.
No more of the enemy had been captured or emigrated, they
were spread over as large a portion of the Territory as ever 9
their hostility burned with a? much fierceness as everT their
incursions for murder and (lurdet were as frequent and a*
fatal as before So cot ft lent did they remain in their prowess,
and bo untamed in their Jeiccity, that it was butashoit time
ago they had engaged in battle a laige force of the regular
army, headed by Col Worth himself, w th equal advantage in
the fight No communication had been obtained with any of
the outlying binds ihe swamps of the Apahthicola in the
west, of the Ockiocknee and OiCiiitii the middle, of the Su-
wannee, Okefenokce, andtheevejgi de i theeabt, weiefenown
to be infected with Indmi**, with whom n > teims were possible,
for no inteicouiM? had been ei!e< t dwithfhfm Yet, in the face
of these fac^b, evidentu g no char ^e m the state of hostilities,
the once repudiated propositions ol Col Worth are reverted to,
ard suddenly adopted as the hisis of a policy which apparently
has for its object nothing in >re than an opportunity to announce
a final termination of the war
Why, sir so far from thee hawng been a change for the bet 
ter during the interval between the fitst rejertion and subse-
quent adoption of the scheme let mesh iw theHou^e how muck
