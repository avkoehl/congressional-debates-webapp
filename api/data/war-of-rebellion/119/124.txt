WM. F. NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 16, 1863.

General THOMAS JORDAN, Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: It has been suggested by my brother, Mr. D. W. Branch, that the difficulty of holding that portion of Morris Island now in the possession of the enemy (after we shall have retaken it) might be gotten over by establishing a camp there for holding under heavy guard all Yankee prisoners, officers and privates, until it can be strongly fortified.

These prisoners to be exposed during our operations.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOHN L. BRANCH.

SURGEON-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

SIR: The Secretary of War has approved of a suggestion made by the Surgeon-General that such of the rebel wounded as are able to travel be sent as soon as practicable to the rebel States, and has directed the Surgeon-General to consult with you on the subject. You are respectfully requested to give your views and suggestions on this subject.

By order of the Surgeon-General:

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. R. SMITH,

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., July 17, 1863.

Brigadier General W. A. HAMMOND,

Surgeon-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL In reply to your letter of this morning in reference to sending wounded rebel prisoners to the rebel States, I have the honor to advise you that at this time, by direction of the Secretary of War, no prisoners of war are being delivered, and when deliveries are made it must be done at the places named in the cartel. I will inform you when the delivering of prisoners is resumed, and from that time it will probably be most convenient for the convalescents to be sent from hospitals from time to Fort Delaware, to be forwarded by the first opportunity.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
