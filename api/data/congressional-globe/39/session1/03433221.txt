attachment to their States and to diminish
their pride and interest in them. Then the
blighting work of centralization will have been
accomplished and local self-government de-
stroyed, and the small rivulets and original
sources of political power in this country will
have become corrupted and the centralgovern-
mout a despotism. The patriotic alarm, sounded
none too soon by President Johnson on the
22d of February last, will then have become
verified prophecy.
It is not possible, if the history of our coun-
try has any value or contains any truth, that it
was ever intended by the framersof our Federal
Constitution, who were at the same time pio-
neers and equally interested in the,organization
of our State governments, that the former
should ever attempt to take the management
of or legislate for the private and local affairs
and interests of the people in the States. Such
policy is everywhere deprecated and denounced
by them as most dangerous to the best inter-
ests of both Governments. They have always,
and with singular unanimity and tenacity, in-
sisted that the chief element in our system of
governments, which at once combines safety
to liberty and great strength, is that of a well-
defined and faithfully observed division of
powers between the general and the local gov-
ernments. It was their most cherished aim to
establish firmly and observe faithfully this di-
vision. Let us not tolerate any other purpose.
We cannot cultivate a sounder or more benefi-
cent policy. Let us devote the energies of
this General Government to its appropriate
duties; to the wise superintendence of those
general interests which pertain to and can lie
best administered by it; to its vast externa)
affairs. Let us look more to the economical
management of its finances and the reduction
of the burdens of the people. Let us do jus-
tice promptly and with a liberal hand to the
gallant and self-sacrificing defenders of the
Government and country, and hasten to resume
our career of union, peace, and prosperity.
Lei us discountenance all attempts at legisla-
tion calculated to produce discontent or sec-
tional agitation. Let us give resl, not new
commotion, to our country after its fearful
struggles during the last five years, and we
shall thus do the most exalted service to it and
to mankind.'-
The SPEAKER stated there were several
gentlemen who wished to speak, but were not
now prepared, and if there were no objection
they could hand their speeches to the reporters
to be printed in the Globe.
There was no objection, and it was ordered
accordingly.

eration :

coneuning,) That there bo printed lor the use of tho
members ot the Xhuty-IS'inth Congress tho reports

scsmou ot Congre>, the same number and in tho
same style :;s were printed of the loports heretofore
made by ::aM committee.
There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. WADB. While the committee on the
conduct of the war was in being, we had not
much time to investigate the western cam-
paigns, and long before the committee expired
we wrote to the generals in the West staling to
them that we would liko each of them to give
us a narrative of what he thought was impor-
tant. There was some complaint that our
investigations had been made principally in
regard to the eastern armies, and thereupon
the committee requested the leading generals
of the western armies to give us a narrative
of the operations of tho armies under their
particular observation, and send it to us as
soon as they couid. At that time they were
very much occupied. Some of them sent in
their reports earlier than others, but none of
them in time to be bound with the leport made
by the committee. Their reports, which 1 now
have before me, contain a good deal of infor-
mation that 1 think is of the greatest interest-
to the public. It will furnish most authentic
