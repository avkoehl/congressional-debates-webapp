II. VIRGINIA.

SCHEDULE A.

RICHMOND, May 18, 1863.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: The commissioners appointed under section 5 of the bill recently passed by the Confederate Congress regulating impressments constitute a board whose duty it shall be to fix upon the prices to be paid by the Government for all property impressed or taken for the public use aforesaid, so as to afford just compensation to the owners thereof. Said commissioners shall agree upon and publish a schedule of prices every two months, or oftener it they shall deem it proper.

In accordance with the foregoing requisition we respectfully lay before you the following schedule of prices for the ensuing two months. Owing to the difficulty in obtaining satisfactory information as to pork, beef, and materials of clothing, &amp;c., we have postponed their appraisement till our next assignment. It is proper to add that Mr. W. B. Harrison was invited to act as third commissioner, and that this appraisement receives the unanimous approval of the commissioners.

The following are the maximum prices to be paid for the articles appraised at all cities and usual places of sale, and when impressed elsewhere the same prices are to be paid elsewhere, less the cost of transportation to the city or usual place of sale to which the article would go ordinarily for sale from that neighborhood, or less the cost of transportation to the point at which the Government needs the article and wishes it to be sent, provided that in no case the amount deducted for transportation as above shall exceed 25 cents per bushel for grain and 25 cents per hundredweight for long forage, flour, bacon, iron, &c. ; in addition to trice of transportation, the Government to pay all legal tolls, and, where farmers cannot procure nails for baling forage, Government to furnish the same at cost, which will be deducted from the established price of baling:
