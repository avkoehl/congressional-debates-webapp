it was supported by artillery. This does not look like running away, as the picket was on one of the roads I apprehend he would take to go off on. I have ordered a strong picket of cavalry to stand 12 miles forward, and I am trying to increase my means of gaining intelligence from the enemy, which is now very meager. The wheat is in stacks and corn on the stalks. To make it available is no small matter and a great tax on cavalry.

I wish we had some of that surplus of which we hear so much and see so little. My men are in good health and spirits.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
