Major L. M. DAYTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have been endeavoring to find a command fro Major-General Schurz, knowing that he desires to serve with the Twentieth Corps. Ward's division is the only one that could under any circumstances be given him, both the other commanders having been with their divisions since the commencement of the war. General Ward has also bee in command of his division during the past two campaigns. He has served faithfully, and is extremelyanxious to remain with it one more campaign. In view of the excellent service done by his command since we left Atlanta, and of his earnest patriotism, I cannot think it would be just to relieve him at this time. I regret exceedingly that I have no command suitable for Major-General Schurz.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. SLOCUM,

Major-General, Commanding.
