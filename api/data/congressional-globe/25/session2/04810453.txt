M** CALHOUN «aid that he never knew the Senate to he
wanting in courtesy, and it was judging rather too hard of that
body to suppose that the resolution would not be taken upa&aiu
íf, however it wa^? the determination of the Senate to lay it on

to effect his object in voting against the preamble, and m

vote He wished to express his views on the subject He
thought there would be no hazard inlawing an resolution on the
table, if he thought tlfre was, he would vote agam&t the motion
