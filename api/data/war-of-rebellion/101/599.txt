Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith for the information of the major-general commanding the following report of the Enrolled Militia at Memphis: On the 9th of December, 1864, this militia force numbered in the aggregate 2,445 men, of whom 1,319 were armed. On the 15th of December, 1864, a board of examiners was ordered, and all former exemptions and excuses revoked. This board has already added three new regiments to the previous forces and filled the old ones nearly to the maximum. The organization now is composed of seven regiments and two battalions of infantry and two squadrons of cavalry, numbering in the aggregate 6,941. Arrangements have been made to have them all armed by the 20th instant. The arms are in good condition, as in most regiments they employ hired armorers for the sole purpose of keeping the muskets in order. There is good prospect of bringing their militia force up to 7,000 men. General Diana has been earnest and active, and in this as in all else connected with affairs of his department he has displayed great energy and ability.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN M. WILSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Inspector-General.
