HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, July 3, 1864.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,Commanding Siege Train, Broadway Landing:

Muster-rolls are not in and cannot be to-night. The ammunition train has just arrived. I shall have to trust the wagon master to take Captain Brigham's back to him. I will attend to the rest. I returned an hour ago from Brooker's battery. He has not been able to get as large fatigue paries as he needs, but him guns and magazines are all right, and he will soon have what help he wants. He will not open for a day or two.

THOS. S. TRUMBULL,

Major First Connecticut Artillery.

Colonel H. L. ABBOT,Commanding Siege Train, Broadway Landing:

A foot orderly from each battery brings me the report at 6 p. m. If I am informed before that time as to what ammunition is coming during the night I can keep an orderly from the battery for which it is intended as a guide for the train; if not, I invariably go with the train myself as i cannot trust the mounted orderlies here.
