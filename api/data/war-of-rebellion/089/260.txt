BROADWAY LANDING, VA., October 17, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Hdqrs. Army of the James:

Is General Order 132* designed to place my whole command of the Siege Artillery under General Graham, or, as heretofore with General Ord, only that portion in the district named? One company, First Connecticut Artillery, is north o the James, and seven others are with the Army of the Potomac. Since my first orders on May 17, I have reported the whole Siege Artillery direct to department headquarters, and the officers commanding subdivisions of my command have reported their subdivision to their local commanders. The same system is used for my command serving with the Army of the Potomac. I greatly facilitates business. I would respectfully request that it may continue as heretofore. Please answer as soon as convenient.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
