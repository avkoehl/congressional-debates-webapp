HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 27, 1864-3.30 a.m.

[General PARKE:]

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that it will be better for you to take the Vaughan road, and thence to Poplar Spring Church, instead of the wood road. It will be much better than going through the woods at night time. It is the same route you went before.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 27, 1864-1 p.m.

General GRIFFIN:

I wish you would have your skirmishers on the left to press up against the enemy and commence firing. The woods south of Hather's Run are so dense we need the sound to guide us in moving up. If you see any chance of gaining their line, do it. Have this done (the firing) as soon as you can.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 27, 1864-10.30 p.m. (Received 11.30 p.m.)

General GRIFFIN:

General Meade has decided to have General Hancock withdraw to-night, as the distance around is too great for us to give mutual support. General Crawford will withdraw at daybreak. I wish you would use General Bartlett's brigade, or part of it, to strengthen your line and extend it to the left toward the run at earliest daylight, so as to prevent the enemy getting around your left flank and between you and the run while these withdrawals are going on; after this we shall all be in position on this side.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,October 27, 1864.

[Major-General WARREN:]

GENERAL: I attacked the enemy in the intrenchments where they come down to the creek. They have now re-enforced that point. The rebels who captured prisoners from Hancock are coming in and being captured, and our men recaptured. The rebels have got in on my left flank and Hancock's right. I have prisoners from Mahone.

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.
