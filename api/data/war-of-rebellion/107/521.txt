General F. W. LANDER:

General McClellan desires to be informed by you of the exact position of Unger's. As at present advised McClellan thinks that a position at or near Springfield will best enable you to counteract the designs of the enemy. McClellan fears that at Slane's Cross-Roads with your present forces your position might be exposed to an attack in front and in rear by Jackson's and Loring's columns. Captain Thompson will be instructed before leaving here with respect to transportation for your command.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
