I desire the 12-pounder Napoleon gun. I have not been able to procure tents or flies for my command. I have not a fifth of the number of tents or flies I am entitled to for the men actually present in camp, under the general order designating the number allowed. I can get no spades and only a few axes.

I have the following transportation for this command: Twelve 4-mule wagons and three 2-mule wagons, which is greatly insufficient.

If I go into active service in the field I need an ordnance train; and likewise a train for companies.

I have no medical wagons or ambulances. This is the transportation I brought from Vicksburg. McGivern, depot quartermaster, informed me he is expecting to receive a lot of wagons, fifty or more in number. Can I get an order on him to supply the deficiency in my transportation? What course shall I pursue in reference to artillery? I am exceedingly anxious to have my command fully equiped for any and all services.

I am, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. M. COCKRELL,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Missouri Troops.
