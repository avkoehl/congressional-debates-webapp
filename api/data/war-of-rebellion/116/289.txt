HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF VIRGINIA,Fort Monroe, Va., February 20, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

SIR: I have the honor to informyou that the first officer, engineer and crew of the British steamer Fingla and the crew of another British sailing vessel have just arrived in the Roads under a flag of truce. Both these vessels ran the blockade and both it is said were loaded with arms for the rebels. The Fingal had a large number of arms with ammunition. Manyprisoners having just arrived (400) and a number of passengers they cannot be sent to Baltimore and there is no accommodation at the hotel, consequently I have been compelled to send the officers and crews back to Norfolk. I shall keep them at Norfolk until I get a reply from you, believing that they ought not to be permitted to pass.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.
