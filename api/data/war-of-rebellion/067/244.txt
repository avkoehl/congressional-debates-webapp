eenth Corps, to obtain a full supply of all necessary articles from that source. An order was also issued to the medical director by Major-General Wright, commanding Sixth Corps, that any commissary of the corps should furnish whatever rations might be required for by Dr. Suckley. The only means of shelter which could be furnished were such shelter-tents as could be picked up on the battle-field, and small arbors of evergreens, which served to keep off the sun's rays. The Eighteenth Corps was on the right of the Sixth, and between it and the Fifth there was an interval of about 2 miles. A number of the wounds in the Sixth Corps were caused by our own artillery, which was so posted as to fire over the heads of the troops. The Fifth Corps hospitals, near Mrs. Newton's, were broken up on the morning of the 1st, the wounded having been sent off in the train before mentioned, and were re-established during the day near Mrs. Via's house, in open ground, with good and abundant supply of water. The Second Corps hospital was broken up in the afternoon, and followed the corps, which moved during the night by Allen's Mill, and took up position on the left of the Sixth Corps, its left being backwards and resting on a marsh called Elder Swamp. The First and Second Divisions, Cavalry Corps, picketed from the left of the Second Corps to Bottom's Bridge, on the Chickahominy, while the Third Division extended from the right of the Ninth Corps toward the Pamunkey. The trains of the army moved to Anderson's, one-half mile from Parsley's Mill.

General headquarters on the night of June 1 was at Mrs. Via's; early in the morning of the 2nd it moved to the vicinity of the Sixth Corps hospital, 1 mile east of Cold Harbor. During the 2nd of June the battle continued, the Sixth and Eighteenth Corps being those chiefly engaged. The men of the Second Corps were exhausted by the march of the previous night, and did little more than get into position. The Ninth Corps was withdrawn during the forenoon, and moved into line in the gap between the Fifth and Eighteenth Corps. Its hospitals were located near Woody's. This withdrawal exposed the hospitals of the Fifth Corps, and they were moved during the afternoon, at 3 p. m., to the point at which the Prospect Church road crosses the south branch of Matadequin Creek. This location was selected by Major-General Warren, who was deceived as to its relative position by the extremely erroneous maps of that part of the country. It was 5 miles from the line of battle of the corps, and had no good and safe road from it to the front. This hospital was just moved in time, as the enemy occupied the ground around Via's house by 5 p. m. The right wing of the Fifth Corps was attacked about 4 p. m., and partially outflanked, the regular brigade at that point suffering severely. The Second Corps hospital was established in the evening on the bank of a small creek, one-half mile south of Allen's Mill, and directly opposite the Sixth Corps hospitals. Four hundred wounded were brought in the ambulances from the previous location. The number of wounded brought into the field hospitals during the day was as follows:

Second Corps........................................... 20

Fifth Corps............................................ 50

Sixth Corps............................................ 952

Ninth Corps............................................ 190

Eighteenth Corps....................................... 850

Cavalry Corps.......................................... 45

Total.................................................. 2,107
