Mr. COBB. Mr. McIndoe has been seriously
indisposed from a sore throat for several days,

proper for him to come here to-night; I therefore
move he be excused.
The motion was agreed to.
John P. McKinney.
Mr. COX. Mr. McKinney left here some
half an hour ago, and asked me before he left
whether I thought there would be anything before
the House this evening. I did not think the gen-
tleman from Illinois would bung up his amend-
ment in reference to spirits, and I told him I
thought there would not be anything of conse-
quence; and therefore I propose to take any pun-
ishment that may be imposed on my colleague,
vicariously. [Laughter.]

Mr. KELLEY. My colleague from the oil
district is interested in a very large tract of oil
land, is president of a company, and has gone to
the telegraph office to learn the result of recent
borings; and as the Government looks for a very
large revenue from the result, I move that Mr.
Myers be excused.
Mr. ICALBFLEISCH. Then they better send
somebody else down there if the Government
wants any revenue. [Laughter.]

Jenckes. [Renewed laughter.]

Andrew J. Rogers.
Mr. NELSON. I was informed some days
since that Mr. Rogers was sick, and not having

Several Members. He has recovered.
The motion was not agreed to.
Edward H. Rollins. No excuse offered.
James S. Rollins. No excuse offered.
Lewis W. Ross. No excuse offered.
Robert C. Schenck.
Mr.FARNSWORTH. I understood the Chair
to decide that members of committees having
leave to sit during the sessions of the House were
excused.

ment of the result.

not see why he should be excused.

the House knew, had a fever a short time ago, and
has not quite recovered.

John B. Steele. No excuse offered.
John T. Stuart. No excuse offered.

Francis Tiiomas.
Mr. STEVENS. Mr. Thomas is well known
to be somewhat infirm. I think that all old men
ought to be excused. I move that he be excused
on account of his great age.
Mr. MALLORY. The presence of the gentle-
man himself is a sufficient reply to his application
to have Governor Thomas excused. If my friend
from Pennsylvania can attend the sessions of the
House, why cannot Governor Thomas ?
The motion was agreed to.
Robert B. Van Valkenburoh. No excugfe
offered.
