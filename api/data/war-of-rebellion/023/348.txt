HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 16, 1862.

General NELSON, McMinnville:

My orders meant to place all the troops from McMinnville to Murfreesborough, and in an emergency even to Nashville, under one command, but at the same time it was intended that a certain force, which would render Nashville secure against a dash from a large body of cavalry, should remain habitually at Murfreesborough, and not be withdrawn unless in extreme necessity. It was expected that the main body of the cavalry would be of that force and have its headquarters at Murfreesborough, which is perhaps a better position than McMinnville, inasmuch as it is more immediately in the neighborhood where the mischief is to be apprehended. This cavalry it was supposed might some time require to be supported by artillery and infantry. Such a force would be very suitable now at Liberty if there is a reasonable prospect of intercepting Morgan. If Morgan's force is, as you state, 1,800 strong, with four pieces of artillery, Johnson may not be in a condition to gain any certain advantage. Colonel Moody's regiment is ordered to join you. Let it go by the way of Liberty, with two sections of artillery from Murfreesborough, if Johnson is still there and you think proper. I have ordered five companies of Bayles' and four of Wynkoop's cavalry to Murfreesborough. Give such orders as you may think proper for uniting them with their regiments.

If you find advantage in making McMinnville the headquarters of the main cavalry force you may do so; but them a regiment must be left at Murfreesborough. Nothing has been heard of Morgan since he left Gallatin. Keep a lookout in front. I may in a few days want to push you forward to Sparta.

General NELSON, McMinnville:

General Morgan telegraphs Kirby Smith advancing by Big Creek and Hartsville, Tenn. My supposition is that he will have about 15,000 men, and that he will cross the Cumberland about Burkesville and march for the railroad at about Glasgow.

I wish you to proceed yourself forthwith to Kentucky and take command. Organize the old troops now there and the new troops coming in from Ohio and Indiana; meet and drive him back. I will meet you in Nashville tomorrow night. Take General Manson with you to command a brigade of the troops you will organize. Turn the command of your division over to General Ammen. Preserve secrecy.
