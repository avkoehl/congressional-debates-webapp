•                    The Memorial—Extract
" The General Assembly of the State of Lou-
isiana respectfully represent
" That the law passed at the last session of Con-
' gre^s, providing that from and after the 1st day
' ofNovembei, 1819, foreign gold com should cease
' to be cuirent 11 the United States, has produced
' in this State the most pernicious consequences * *
' Ihose real advantages (importation of gold from
' Spanish America) have Ji appeared under the
' operation of the law abovementioned Inasmuch
' as doubloons%ave ceased to be current in the
' United States, no reasonable hope can be enter-
' tamed that tradeis will persist in bringing them
' here, wnen in all parts of the West Indies tney
' can easily, and at an advantageous rate, exchange
' them for every kind of commodities and neces-
' sary supplies * * * Was that law intended
' to place at the disposal of Government, for com-
' age, a sufficient quantity of gold ' If such was
' its ooject, it appears improbable that it will be
'attained, inasmuch as gold being received at a
' very high rate at the Havana, and several other
' places, it will be purchased here for exportation
' at a low price by the moneyed men * * •*
' It appears that Congress, when they fixed a term
' after which that money should cease to be cui-
' lent in the United States, had reason to believe,
'that before the time piescnbed,a quantity of
1 American eagles, nearly equal to the amount of
' the foreign specie withdrawn, would be thrown
' into circulation, but the General Assembly do not
'peiceive that that object has been fulfilled, and
' then had it been, they could not have viewed, witii-
' out regiet, the adoption of a measure which tends
' sensibly to affect the commercial relations be-
' tween LOUISIANA and MEXICO, and which
' would flourish as formerly, if a more immediate
' protection was extended to our navigation in
1 those quarters, (against pirates,) and the above-
' mentioned law repealed "
Having shown the great evils resulting to the
country from the operation of this law, Mr B
called upon its friends to tell what reason could
now be given for not repealing it' He affirmed
that, of the two causes to which the law owed its
ongin, one had failed in. tolo, and the other had
succeeded to a degree to make it the curse and the
nuisance of the country One reason was to
induce an adequate supply of foreign coins to be
brought to the Mint to be recoined, the other to
facilitate the substitution of a bank note cur-
rency
f he foreign coins did not go to the Mint, those
excepted which weie imported in its own neigh-
borhood, and even these were exported nearly as
fast as recoined     The authonty of the directors |
of the Mint had already been quoted to show that
the new coined gold was transterred direct from |
the national Mint to the packet ships bound to Eu- I
rope    The custom housereturnsshowedthelarge I
expoitation of domestic coins    They would be
found under the head of Domestic Manvfaclm es ex
poi led, and made a large figurem the list of these ex-
ports    In the yeai 1832itamountedto $2 058,474,
and in the year lo33 to $1,410,941 and eveiy year
it was more or less, so that the national Mint had
degenerated into a domestic manufactory of gold
and  silver foi  exportation to foreign countries
But the coins imported at New Orleans, at Charles-
ton, and at other points remote from Philadelphia,
did rot go there to be recoined     They were, in
part, exported da ect from the place of import,and
in part used by the people as current money, in
disregard of the prohibitoiy law of 1819    Butthe>
1 greater part was exported, for no ownei of foieign
com could incur the trouble, risk, and expense of
sending it some hundred or a thousand mi'es to
Phihdelphia to have it recoined, and then incur
ring the same ev pense, nsk, and trouble, laying out
of the use of the money, and receiving no interest
-'l the v, hile, of bunging it back to be put in cir
i u'-tion, with the fui hei risk of a deduction for
w°nt of standaid fineness at the Mint, when he

O le in-,    A bi inch of the Mint placed there, could
si, ply the West vi i h domestic coins    Mexico,
since bhe beuame a free country, has established
i seven Mints in different places,* because it was
| troublesome and expensive to carry bullion fiom
all parts of the country to be coined m the capital,
and when coined there, there was nothma in tne
course of trade to carry them back into the coun-
t-y, and the owners of it would not be at the ex
pense and trouble of carrying it back and getting it
into circulation, being the exact state of things at
present in the gold mines of tne southern States
The United States, upon the same principle, and
for the same reasons, should establish branches
of the Mint in the South, convenient to the gold
mine region, and at New Orleans, for the benefit
of that city and the West Without a branch of
the mint at New Orleans the admission of foreign
coins is indispensable to the West, and thus the
inlei est of that region joins itself to the voice of the
Constitution in demanding the immediate repeal of
all laws for lllegalumg the circulation of these
coins, and for sinking them from their current
value as money to thjir Mint value as bullion
The design of supplying the Mint with foreign
coins tor recoinage had then failed, and in that re
spect the exclusion of foreign coins had failed in
one o-f its ob]°cts, in the other, that of making
room for a SUBSTITUTE of BANK NOTES,
the success of the scheme has been complete, ex
cessive, and deplorable
Mr B said, tnat m demanding the restoration
of foreign coins, he was not preferring a new or
unheard of demand before the Senate It was evi
dent, from the great number of times that the law
for the exclusion ot foreign co ns had been sus-
pended, so as to postpone its final taking effect
fiom 1793 to 1819—a period of twenty six years—
that the opposition of the community to it was
deep and abiding, and only overcome after a quar-
ter of a centuiv of perseverance on the part of the
Federal Government, and jn the complete triumph
of the paper system, in the establishment, for the
second time, of a Bank of the United States, and
making the promissory notes of its corporators a
legal tender to the Federal Government, and equal
in law to the gold and silvei of the Constitution
The people had struggled for twenty-sp years for
the preservation of their ancient foreign coins, but
were vanquished at last In the course of this
stiuggle, many reports from committees of Con-
gress, and many memorials from State Legisla-
tures, were brought before Congiess,to arrest the
impending fate of hard money To read all these
íeports and memorials, would be tedious to omit
all, would be unjust to the subject He (Mi B)
had selected two of these papers, both of them
peculiarly applicable to the pi esent state of things
One of these papers (the memorial from the Gen-
eral Assembly of Louisiana) he had read, the other,
being a report from a committee of the Hoase of
Representatives, of which Mr Q,umcy, then a
membei from Massachusetts,was chairman, wouid
now be lead, and-wouid derive peculiar interest
from being the offspring of similar circumstances to
those in which the United States aie now placed
The report was made in 1811, in view of the ap-
proaching termination of the charter of the first
Bank of the United States, and all its reasonings
and conclusions are applicable to the present mo-
ment
MR. quincy's report—Eú?i?act.
V" That the general design of the bill (fiom the
1 Senate) being to increase the current money of the
' United States, by authorizing foreign gold andsil
<" ver coins again to become a legal tender, is impor
1 tant in its object, and may be beneficial in its con-
' sequences     It is-very apparent, that the denial
' to foreign coins of the privileges of currency, and
' of being a legal tender, has at once the combined
1 efteet of ci) cumsci ibing the just sphere of mercan
' tile action, and of encouraging the erportahou of
' that species of coin, to which these privileges are
* By the Federal Const tution of Mexico, dated
October 4, i824, the Fedeial Corgress has the ex
elusive power to fix the weight, standard, and
value of money, but the coinage goes, on m Gua-
naiuato, /icatecas, Guadalajara, Duiango, Chi
huahun, and Sombrerete Before the constitution
of 1^21 ea^h State fixed the v eight,standard,ard
value of its own money and all uniform ty of
value was destroyed, now the general Congiess
fixes it, the value is uniform
' denied In the present circumstances of the Uni-
' ted States, it seems peculiarly unadvisable to per-
' mit any statute prohibitions to continue, which
' have a tendency to produce such an effect The
' statute currency of the United State*, which now
' consists only ot the coinage of the United States
' and the Spanish milled dollars, and paits of dol-
' lais, is also probably msuffic ent for the ordinary
' necessities o' domestic exchange, and is certainly
' wholly inadequate to support any peculiar em-
' harassment of our ciiculating medium, which,
1 in the £ vent of the dissolution of the J3ank of the
' United States, cannot but be anticipated Your
' committee were, therefore, of opinion, that for-
' eign com ought to be made current money, and
' a legal tender "
The report of the committee, Mr B said, was
complied with Foreign coins were again made
a legal tendei, their value regulated, and their im-
portation encouraged This continued to be the
case until af er the present Bank of the United
States was chartered, as scon as that event hap-
pened, and bank policy again became predominant
in 'he halls of Congress, the circulation of foreign
coins was again struck at, and, m the second year
of the existence of the bank, the old act of 1793,
for rendenrg these coins uncurrent, was carrifd
into final and complete effect Since that time the
bank has enjoyed all her advantages from this ex-
clusion The expulsion of these coins has created
a vecuum, to be filled up by her small note circu-
lation, the traffic, and trade in them has been as
large a source of profit to her as of loss to the
country Gold coin she has sold at an advance of
five or six pei cent , silver com at about two or
three per cent , ird, her hand being in, she made
no difference between selling domestic coin and
foreign coin Although forbid bv her charter to
deal in com, she has emp'oyed her branches to
gathei *40,000 000 of coin fiom th  States, a large
pert of which she admits that she has sold and
transported to Euiope For the «¡ileof theforeign
coin, she s ts up the lawyei liKe piea, thatit is not
coin, but bullion' resting the validity of the plea
upon English statute law' while, by the Consti-
tution ot the United States, all foreign coins, are
coins, while by her own charter the coins, both
gold and silvei, oF Great Biitam, France, Spain,
Poitugal, and their dominions, are declaied to be
CMn, and as such, made íeceivable in payment of
the specie proportion of the bank stock, and,
worse yet, while Spanish dolíais, by statute, re-
mam the current coin of the United States, of
which Spanish milled dollars the bank admits the
sale of $4,450,1-12
Mr B then took a rapid view of the present
condition of the statute currency of the United
States—of that cuirency which was a legal ten-
der—that currency which a debtor had a right by
law to protect his property from execution, and
his body from jail, by offering it, as a matter of
right, to his creditor in payment of his debt He
stated this statute cuuency to be, fust coins fiom
the Mint of the Un ted Stato, secondly, Spanish
milled dolla-s and the pans of such dollars
This was the sum total of the statute currency of
the United Spates, for happily no paper of any
bank, State or Federal, could be made a legal
tendei This is the sum total out of which any
man n debt can legally pay his debts, and what
is his chance for making payment out of tins brief
list' Let us see Coinage from the Mint, nota
part cle of gold, noi a single whole dollar, to be
found ' very few half dollars, except in the neigh-
borhood of the Mint, and in the hands of the Bank
of the United S ates and its branches, the 25, 10,
and ■> cent pieces scarcely seen, except as a curi-
osity in the mteiior parts of the country So
much for th e domestic coinage Now for th e Span-
ish milled dollars How do they stand in the Uni-
ted Stites? Nearly as scarce as oui own dollars,
foi theie nas been none coined since Spain lost her
dominion ovei hei colonies in the New World and
