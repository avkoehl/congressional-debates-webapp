General JOHN C. BRECKINRIDGE:

Following dispatch just received from operator at Waynesborough:

No Yankees this side of Martinsburg. Yankees are reported to have crossed mountain at White's Gap and are coming back to Staunton.

I suppose the latter part, if true at all, can only apply to raiding party to Amherst, but it is absolutely necessary to have correct information, and you will send out a cavalry scouting party to go and see the enemy at all hazards. Intelligent citizens might be employed as scouts and with advantage. I will get to Lynchburg as soon as I can, unless the force in Bedford is a mere raiding party.

J. A. EARLY,

Lieutenant-General.

GENERAL: The inclosed communication (copy) was sent you at 5.30 p. m. General Hill has just informed the major-general commanding that the troops have not been placed in position, and the tenor of his note indicates that you have not conferred with him. He desires me to ascertain from you the reason which has prevented compliance with instructions so explicit, and the failure to observe which may involve such serious consequences.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
