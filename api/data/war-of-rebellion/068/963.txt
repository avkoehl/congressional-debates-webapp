intended before hearing from you to have moved General Chambliss lower down near Pisgah Church, as there is nothing of consequence in upper Culpeper. If Averell is coming it will be necessary to keep this brigade here. General Chambliss has sent scouts toward Luray. The artillery has not reported as yet, but hope to see it to-day.

Captain Bolling reports a brigade of Yankee cavalry opposite Morton's Ford.

Very respectfully,

WM. H. F. LEE,

Major-General.
