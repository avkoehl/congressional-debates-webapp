Scouting parties of my command, sent out from Freeman's Bridge, visited Littleton, down the Nottoway River, where General Wilson encamped last night; also Sussex and point up the river south of Stony Creek. They collected in a few of our men. Met no rebels, except a few small parties that ran off into the swamps. I will move back in the morning in compliance with your dispatch. I do not know of any point in the vicinity of Prince George Court-House where I can establish a camp on account of the want of water, but will locate at the most convenient place in the vicinity of Price George Court-House where water can be obtained.
