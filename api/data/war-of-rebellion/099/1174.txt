Colonel GEORGE WILLIM BRENT,

Assistan Adjutant-General, Augusta, Ga.:

Twenty-five hundred men of Stewart's corps were furnished. Those who have returned are passing through by regiments. Cheatham's division has to pass, and is on its way. This includes all. I have established a camp of direction to prevent the straggling of returning squads. Will promptly move headquarters as soon as above troops have passed.

(Received 15th.)

General S. COOPER, Adjutant and Inspector General:

Dispatch of 10th received. I do not know the extent of the duties indicated. Had just tendered my services to General Beauregard to build up his army, if Government would give me control of that branch of the service, subject to his orders, west of Savannah River, from whence his army comes. To restore to that army the great number of the stragglers is now of highest importance, requiring for success the assistance, temporarily, of a large number of efficient officers. These could be supplied from the supernumerary officers. Before consultation, which does President prefer I should do?

G. J. PILLOW,

Brigadier-General.

Respectfully submitted to Honorable Secretary of War.
