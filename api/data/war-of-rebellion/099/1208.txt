General BRECKINRIDGE,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

Far from interfering with provisions at Charlotte Junction, I have done all I could to send everything forward from Columbia. I advise removal of all supplies, except 200,000 rations, from Charlotte to a safer place farther north. No times should be lost.

General J. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Whilst in Augusta I ordered preparations made for removal of all stores and supplies, but deficiency of trains and lack of energy failed to accomplish all that was required; much, however, was removed.

RIDGEWAY, S. C., February 17, 1865-9. 30 p. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Richmond, Va.:

Enemy having forced crossing of Saluda and Broad Rivers above Columbia, city had to be evacuated this morning. My forces are now retiring on this place. Everything possible shall be done to retard enemy's advance, but I cannot separate cavalry from infantry without fear of disaster, owing to small number of latter, only about 3,000 effectives. Moreover, having no supply trains troops must move along railroads.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
