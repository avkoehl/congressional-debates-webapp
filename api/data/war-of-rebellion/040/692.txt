streams crossed by that road, whether the bridges are still standing and if the fords can be passed by infantry. It will not be necessary for you to send farther for this information than to Captain J. W. Marshall, provost-marshal of Pocahontas, who is believed to be at Huttonsville. He can give you information of the condition of the north of the mouth of Nap's Creek.

I wish you to send the accompanying letter* to Captain Marshall by a special courier, and direct him to hurry back the captain's answer.

You will regard this note as strictly confidential, and make your preparations without attracting attention.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

Telegraphed you this morning in regard to Fifty-fourth Virginia Regiment. Cannot tell whether I can spare any troops until I hear from you in reply. The Fiftieth and Fifty-fourth are large regiments; each as large, I expect, as General Lee's two.
