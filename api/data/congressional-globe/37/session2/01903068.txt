THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 2,
as ia now allowed to a captain in the Array. The
mean of a major's pay in theArmy,according to
the Register published at our instance, is $2,940.
The officer who corresponds with him in rank in
the Navy is a lieutenant commander, and his pay
is fl,906, under this proposition, or $1,000 less
than the officer of the A rmy of corresponding ran k.
The mean pay of lieutenant colonels in the Army
is $3,242. Under this bill a commander in the
Navy will have relative rank with a lieutenant col-
onel in the Army,and his sea pay, under this bill,
will be $2,928, his other-duty pay $2,343, and his
leave-of-absence pay §1,875, making his mean pay
$2,347. A captain of the Navy corresponds in
rank with a colonel. A colonel's pay is $3 663.
The mean pay of a naval captain, under this
amendment, is §2,960; about seven hundred dol-
lars less than an officer has in the corresponding
rank in the Army, A brigadier general's mean
pay in the Army is $4,551; a commodore s mean
pay I propose shall be $3,700, or $800 less than
the Aimy officer's pay. A major general's is
$6 536; the admiral's mean pay, under this amend-
ment, is §4,650, or $2,000 less than the mean pay
of an officer of the Army ranking with him. It
is shown better perhaps by presenting it m tabu-
lar form:

That is the relative pay between the correspond-
ing ranks of the Army and Navy; and now I ask
the attention of the Senate for a few minutes
while I show what is the comparison between the
rates now allowed to officers of the Navy and what
is proposed to be allowed. At present the moan
pay of a captain is $3,600. Under this proposi-
tion his moan pay will be $2,960.
Mr. COLLAMER. The {Senator passes over
admirals.
Mr.GRIMES. We have no admirals now. I
am now comparing the proposed pay of officers
of the Navy with the pay under the law as it now
stands to officers of the same title and rank in the
service.
Mr. COLLAMER. The highest pay we now
allow is to captains.
Mr. GRIMES. Yos, sir.
Mr. COLLAMER. Now, all the admirals are
above that.
Mr. GRIMES. Certainly. We create the new
grade, and I am comparing the pay of officers of
the Navy as they now exist with the pay as I
proposed. We have no pay to compare with that
of the new grades, as a matter of course. I am
stating the pay of a captain as it now is and under
the proposition I have submitted.
Mr. COLLAMER. But our captains will now
bo made into admirals, and their pay will be in-
creased.
Mr. GRIMES. Other officers come up and
take their places,and we make only nine admirals.
The mean pay of a captain now is $3,600. As I
propose, it will be $2,960. A captain under this
bill will perform precisely the same duties that he
docs now; but the saving to the Treasury is, that
we cut down his pay while he is on shore doing
nothing, and give in each of the grades a higher
nay while the officer is afloat serving the country.
The trouble with the present pay bill is, that too
high pay is allowed to officers on leave. The Sen-
ator from New Hampshire knows perfectly well
how that was done. He has already stated that
it was at the instance of officers and their families
quartered about in this neighborhood, who came
here and insisted that it was the home captain who
should have the pay, and not the officer afloat. £
propose by my amendment to change that order
of things—to cut down the pay of the men who
arte living ashore and doing nothing, and give an
extra amount of pay to officers who are afloat.
Hence it is that I propose to allow to a captain,
while at se , $3,660. He now gets $3,600. But
when we put him ashore, instead of his getting
$3,600 as he docs now, I propose to give him only
$2,343, and that is plenty when he is doing noth-
ing. 1 make a corresponding saving throughout
the entire grades.
I now show how this amendment will affect
officers on the retired list, and the relative pay
that will be allowed to officers of the Army and
Navy of corresponding grades by the following
table:

The point which the Senator makes is that \vc
should notpay these nine admirals any more than
we are now paying a captain or a commodore who
is afloat. I suppose it will be the policy of the
Government to give these admirals a pay corre-
sponding to their rank. We are going to impose
new duties on them. They will have very grave
responsibilities resting on them. We all know
that an admiral who is in command of a squadron
* The ?um>m this column of "lowebt pay" are exclusive

f All in command of companies are allowed ten
dollars per month additional.
$ All officeis in the Navy, while attached to a sea-going
vessel, are entitled to one ration in kind, or commuted at |
the rate fixed by the Department. The present rate of com-
mutation is twenty-live cento per day— ninety dollars per
annum.
on a foreign station is obliged to incur a great
many expenses which are not incident to the cap-
tain of the. ship; and as you furnish him an ad-
ditional rank, you ought to furnish him addi-
tional means to support that rank respectably in
foreign countries whither he may be sent by the
Government of the country. The officers that
are to be retired will not be any more extensively
retired, or impose additional burdens upon us, as
admirals, than if retired in their present capacity.
Except of the nine admirals, there will be, compar-
atively, no increase of expense, and that is only
a few hundred dollars.
Mr. HALE. Eighteen commodores.
Mr. GRIMES. But they do not get any addi-
tional pay. The nine admirals are the officers
who get additional pay, and that is a very small
amount. It does not amount to §900, and they
are old worn-out men who have served the coun-
try faithfully, and I do not begrudge them that
small pittance.
Under this proposition, as I have already stated,
the aggregate saving to the Treasury over the
pay bill as it now stands will be $174,047 in a
year. Unless some more substantial reason shall
be assigned against it than has been assigned thus
far, I trust it will be adopted, or unless some uni-
form, tangible substitute shall be piesented m its
stead.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Kino in
the chair.) The question before the Senate is on

shire, to strike out the words "at sea, or attached
to a sea-going vessel," in line six of the amend-
