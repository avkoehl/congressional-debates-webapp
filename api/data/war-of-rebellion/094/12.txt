MURFREESBOROUGH, December 1, 1864-2.15 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

I shall be ready to send back block-house garrisons as far as Duck River so soon as General Steedman's troops shall all pass here. Shall not do this? They have all been brought off. If I do not hear from you when General Steedman passes, I shall send the garrisons back, as I fear delay may result in the loss of the bridges. Hope you will approve; I can recall if you direct it.
