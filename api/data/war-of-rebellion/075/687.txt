HEADQUARTERS CLEBURNE'S DIVISION,Foot of Dup Gap, Ga., May 10, 1864.

Lieutenant General J. B. HOOD:

GENERAL: I respectfully request permission to fire off the wet guns of my division before going on the Sugar Valley trip, for which order has just been received. Two of my brigades, Granbury's and Polk's, are on top of mountain at Dup Gap. On account of the tired condition of the troops it will be impossible to move before daylight.

Very respectfully,

P. R. CLEBURNE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Near Alt's House, May 10, 1864-2.25 p. m.

Major-General WHEELER:

GENERAL: I am unable to decide what the Yankees are endeavoring to accomplish. The force in Crow's Valley, was of Rocky Face, is reported to be moving to our left. There seems to be no force threatening us except on Rocky Face, and that force has been unusually quiet to-day. All safe at Resaca. Hood and command will return this evening. No news. I am only uneasy about our right, and won't be uneasy about that when Hood returns. Report promptly any movement of troops on Varnell's Station road. It is from that point I apprehend danger.

Very truly,

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.
