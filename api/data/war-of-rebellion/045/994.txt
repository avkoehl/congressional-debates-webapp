JULY 11, 1863-8. 30 p. m.

Major-General STUART,

Commanding, &c.:

GENERAL: Your note of sunset to-day is received. You are right in keeping your cavalry in front of the infantry as long as possible. I do not desire you to take position on our left with your whole force, until pushed back upon the infantry in front, but if you could station a portion of your cavalry on our left toward the Conococheague it would be desirable. As our limits are reduced by the advance of the enemy, I think this would be practicable. Select such cavalry for this purpose as you prefer.

As regards Imboden, when you take position on the left you can take command of him, and station him where he can be of most service.

Since my previous note, Captain [William F.] Randolph, commanding courier company, of general Ewell`s corps, who is on the Greencastle road, and 3 miles from the Pennsylvania line, reports:

"No enemy, and uo report of any. " Captain [R. E.] Wilbourn, signal officer, reports no enemy in Ewell`s front this side of Antietam. Robertson is 2 2/1 miles in front of Ewell.

I inclose a letter for Colonel Wickham.

Very respectfully, & c.,

R. E. LEE,

General.
