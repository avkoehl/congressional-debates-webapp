SPEECH OF MR. FILLMORE,
Or New York,
In the House of Repi esentalnes, Septe nbei 25,1837 —
On Ihe bill to postpone the fourth instalment of
deposite with the States.
Mr. FILLMORE then said it was w nh extreme
leluctarce that he v entured to throw himself upon
the indulgence of the committee, at that latehpurof
the day, and after such a protracted debate But
(he confmu-d) it is not my fault, sir, that I addic-s
you at this 'une Ihaie made eiery reasonable
effort, that a modest mpn could make, for some dap,
to obtain the florr, and now, for the tirst time, I
have been successful I am now prepared, sir, not-
witl standing tlie lateness of the hour, to ofler what
I have say on th s subject, but if the committee
prefer to use, and continue the discusión to mor-
row, it will suit me quite as well For the purpose
of testing the sense of the committee on that point, I
will cheerfully yield Ihe flooi for a motion to lis 
fHere a motion w<is made to rise, which was nega
tived, and Mr F pioeeeded ] I am content, sir,
with Ihe determination of the committee to hear me
to night.
What then, sir, is ti e h stoiy of this «-mplu^ re-
venue, upon which (he bill upon vour table is to
operate, and which has elicited such a warm dis-
cussion'2 It is this, sir—our levenue had been
graduated upon a scale sufficiently large, for many
years, to collect from the people, chiefu by duties,
a sum, which, together with the moneys received
irom the sale o( public lands, not only defiayed all
the expensfs of Government, but left annually a
laige surplus to be applied m payment of ihe na-
tional debt This debt, sir, which, at the adoption
oí the Federal Constitution, «as xipwaids of
§75,000,000, had, bv Ihe cperat on of ¡his sv tem,
been giadua'lv reduced, so flirt, in 1812, before
the commencement of the last war, if «as onlj
about 045,000,000 The expenses of that war, sir,
again increased this debt, so that, m 1816, it was up-
wards of §127,000,000 A wise forecast had made
ample pro; ision for its piyment, and y ear by year
it was lessened, until 1834, when it was fin lly ex-
tinguished
It was apparent, sir, to all, lefore this debt «as
finally liquidated, that when that event did occur,
the same system jÍ indirect taxation, «Inch could
not suddenly be changed v ithout injury to cur
manufactures, mu«t ihrow a large amount of sur-
plus revenue into the Tieasmy. This money hav-
ing been thus collec ed fiom tie people, or being
the avails of the public hnds, it «"as thought no
more than reasonable, as it was not wanted foi
Government purpeses, to uturn it again to the
people, fiom wlom it had been taken, ind «hose
it «as I shall not now stop, sir, to inquire into
the justice or constitutionality of the measine It
"was cleariv jjst The Government had this fund
PS the agent of the people I hold, su, that the
Government, in all cases, is but the agent and in-
strument o the people, consi luted to execute their
collective «ill
To testoie this laige amount of money to the
use of those from whom it had been taken, with as
little injur,' as possible to the country, Congress
passed a law on the 26ih day of June, 1836, b)
which it «as declaied that the Secretary of the
Treasury should, on the 1st day of January, 1837,
ascertain how much money there was in the Trea-
sury, and deduct from the «hole sum thus found
f 5,000,000, and that the lemamder should be de-
posited with the several States, or such of them as
should consent to receive the same, one-fourth on
each of ihe 1st days of Januaiy, April, Tuly, ajj
October, in 1837 upon the conditions prescribed in
the act, «'hich vveie, that the States should keep
if safely, and ielurn it again n the United States,
in sums not exceeding $10,000 per month, from
any one State, and so in the like proportion from
other Statps, «hen «anted for the use of the Gov-
ernmert, and demanded by the Secretory of the
Tieasmv But the Spcretary w-is authonzed to
draw for §20,000 on giv ing thirty days' notice I
do not pretend, sir, to give the words of the act v ei-
batnn, as I have it not belore me, and I only speak
from lecolJection But this is the substance of the
act of Congress
This, sir, «as the p'oposi'ion on the pirt of the
United S'ates, of the term, upon which they were
v ilhng to deposite this money with the States
This, too, was a propositirn emanating iiom the
highest—nay, from all the separate depaaments of
tins Government It «'as pledging the nat onal
fai'h in the most solemn maunei that it could be
pledged, by a law which received the assent of
both houses ol Congress and the approbat on cf
the President
The State of Sew *iak, sir, bv an act of its
Legislature, passed, I think, m J nuaiy, 1837,
agreed to iccept this proposition made bv he United*
States, ard to receive the mone^, and safely keep
and return the sime w I en called for, accoirhng to
the terms of said act of Congress, and pledged the
faith of the Slate for the faithful performance of
these acts This, then, oensl tuled the contract or
compact between Ihe parlies
The Secretary of the Treusun, ps duected by
the act of Congress, asceitamed, on the 1st thy if
.Tanuaiv last, the a tq< urt of m mey in 't*e Treasury
and nftel deducing, as he supposed, «15,000,001
from tint sum fi und theie r rn ned to 1 - oq osp-
el with the S-it-s 937,<«68,8W T I <■.,, , n« ¡,c
"supposed," su ; for ¡t now appeals bv his lale
report to this house, that there «as $1,670,137 52
in the Treasury, (that is, sir, in the pet btnks,) on
that day, of which he had received no account So
that, m reality, he reserved $6,670,137 52, instead
of the ^5,000,000, as directed by the act
Well, sir, ihe portion of this which belonged to
the State of New York by the terms of the compact
was $5,352,694 28, three-fourths of which has
been received b., thit State, and the hi'l now en
youi table pioposes to postponi the payment of the
remaining §1,338,173 57 to «Inch tbat State «ill
be entitled on the 1st day of Octobei n"\t by the
terms of (h  compact
Now, sir let it be borne m mind 'hat this ¡s one
entire contract, in reference to one en'ire sum of
money, and that it has, been partiallv pel formed I
sav, sir, the sum is entire Although it was to he
paid at different times, vet the ippropnation was
of the enure sum that should Ic found in the Tiea-
sury on a certain day That sum, «1 en ascer-
tained in the manrerprescribed by th" -c', vis the
money sot apart foi this specific puiposc It was
in legal intendment ts definite and fixed as though
the moncv 1 id then been counted out at the srvenl
banks wbeie it «?s deposited on that diy , and 1 nd
as de foi this object True, it «as to be pail out
at different tiroes But thi«vas to accommodite
the banks, aid ]icvcnt i derang mont of the cur-
rency, and consequent distress of '1 e commu^itv ,
by calima; for too brge «un s at once
But, Mi Chairman, T am oppos=d to the bill
upon your table I im epposed to it first, s r, on
the giou id that it is hytocrtticl and fa'se m us
lanruat-e The atle of he bill is-i "act to ;w/-
; )!?" the pigment of this fouilh nstalment This
is a false ¡al el, s r, to ihe dooi thrciah which «e
are to enter into the mWeries of this bill But lei
us look to the bill itself It dcclans that the pa,-
ment ot this instalment "shall be postponed until
furthei piovmon by law " What is th s then, s)r
but a -ipetl of so much of the act of 18 ÍG a^ au-
thorizes the p'vment of this fouilh ins ilment ' It
does not meitly postpone the payment to a defirpe
time, then to be mrde without any further legisla-
tive action but it postpones it until fuithcr ' pro-
vision by law," that is, unti1 bv a «eij lino C ngies
shall duect this payment tobe urde If this bill
pass, nothing short of a new law can evei give this
rionev to th" States     Then the effect of tips bill is
to repeal the law of 1336
Why not say su, theni Why profess to post-
pone i hen you absolutely revoke' Why not call
things by their right names' Is there some imqa -
ty in the transaction that it is necessary to conceal"2
Is it intended to excite expectations among the peo-
ple thit are never to be realized ' Sir, I disdain
such at curse I will nevei give my vote for a
law that on its face bears evidence of ftaudulcnt
coneeJmert and hypocntica! designs
I am aware, sir, that an amendment has been of-
fired bv the gentleman from South Carolina, (Mr
Pickens,) that, if adopted, would obviate this ob-
jection But as that amendment is undcubte lly in-
tended to sugar ovei this nauseous pi'l, to make it
a lit'le more partible 'o some « 10 loa'he it now,
ard as I should still be opposed to the bill if the
amendment were adopted, for leasons which I shall
horealter give, I am inclined to let fhose who are
piepared to swallow any thing take the dose as it
is, an i vote against the amendment as «ell as the
bill If tins money be not now paid, I have no
idea that the States will ever receive it Let us
have it now, accouling to the promise, or tell us at
once that wc have nothing to expect Do not t*m-
tali/e us bv exciting furiher hopes that are never to
be rea'ized
But, sir, I am also opposed to the bill foi another
reason, and that is, that this sudden change of the
destiny of near ten millions of d d'ars is calculated
still further to denngc th3 ouirency and business
opeiations of the countn,and add to the accumula-
ted distresses of the community under which they
now 'nboi If there bu o no liulh, above all others,
well ett'ed in political ta uomy, it is this that if
y<u would m<>l e ■> nation p osperous and happy,
eivc t1 em " umfonn ind nchangeable currency
It s as is enu il ps mnf umitv ind stib h y in your
v, "i h s ami meisincs fn s cui ency is th" hfe-
bbt il of the b d\ politic lis suppl/ should be
equal and uniform Every throb of the heart is
felt to the utmost extremities If the regular flow
and pulsation fid, languor and famtness follow ,
but "overaction," "s ihe TPiesident calls it, often
produces instantaneous paralysis and prostration
The political empirics have administered dose upon
elose, and tried experiment after experiment, until
the parent is piostrate and helpless, wnrhui^ in
agonv and imploring foi íeliet If ever there was
a notion or an individual, to whom that epitaph
was peculiiil/ appr pni*e, it is this nation and this
Ai'n in stratioii
¡ I w is v,   t   Í wi^f " 1   o be b"tt i

I am also opposed to th s bill, sir, for another lea-
son Its object and intent is to violate the plighted
faith of this nation 1 hall not entei into an exami-
nation to see whetnei ihe offer on die part of the
Un-ted States, which w?sacceded toby the State of
New Yon , in the manner that I have already sta-
tu!, was oi «as not a pecuniary contiact according
to the stnet íules oí th' lonimon law, «Inch might
be enforced in a com I of justice This point has
been mesti ilh and eloquently discussed by my col-
l^idie immsdtatelv m front of me, (Mr Sibley )
I coul ' add nothing to what he has said on that sub-
pet It is siid hat t1 •■ Lmled Stiteshave receiv-
ed no cons deration foi the promise But, «n, I
"ip '' -, ost d to place tins quesuon on h ghergrountls
Does it beccme tl is natirn or Ihe Amtiican Con-
gress to sfnd here palfeime about the re lemption
i t its phghted faith to one of the laughters of this
Uni n, on the «nonnd thi* it has received no con-
side Tt ell f r Ihe piomise which it has m?de? Has
tins ii io>- indeed sunk so low that it takes shel-
ter f m ts engagements, when it finds it inconve-
nient to p-rfoun them, behind the statute of frauds'*
The i"isin why a censiderafion is required to en-
force a ccntiact tetvvem individuals does not apply
to tl s cisc That is a idle adopted bv the courts
tiputect the inccr)= iderate and t1 e unwary fiom
the cor sequences of their own fo'ly, m making 1 ps-
ty p (raises without consideration But sir, even
as between individuáis, jf ihe manner m which the
ct n i act has been made ev mees a due degree of de-
hoeiatton, then the courts will enforce it If, for
v sfnee, the contract b" 'ealed, that is regarded as
so solemn an act; anl evidences such camion and
