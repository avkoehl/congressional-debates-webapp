Honorable B. F. WADE,

Chairman of Committee on Conduct of the Present War:

SIR: The absence from my immediate command of those men and officers who are best acquainted with the facts in regard to the employment of Indian savages has delayed my reply to your communication of April 2, 1862,# until this time.

I have the honor to now lay before the committee the statements and affidavits inclosed, from which it will appear that large forces of Indian savages were engaged against this army at the battle of Pea Ridge, and that the warfare was conducted by said savages with all the barbarity their merciless and cowardly natures are capable of.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
