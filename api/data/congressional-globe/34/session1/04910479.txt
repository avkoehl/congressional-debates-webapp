If this question was one of sufficient import-
ance to attract public attention in 1845, when we
owned but one Territory on the Pacific, how
much more important is it now? We now own
more than 1,000 miles upon the Pacific coast, cowr-
tng' 464,000 square miles of territory—being 130,000
square miles more Man that now constituting- the thir-
teen original States, and thirteen times as large as the
State of Ohio. We have an active and energetic
population of 500,000 upon that coast.
At the last presidential election there were fif-
teen States, each of which gave fewer votes than
California; and at her election last fall 97,000 votes
were polled, which was only exceeded by nine
Other States at the presidential election of 1852.
The people of California have made, for mining
purposes, some M0 miles of tunnels into the bow- ;
els of the mountains, in which they have con- j
structed railroads. They have dug, for similar pur- <
poses, more than 4,500miles of canals and ditches; I
and this will be increased the present year to
nearly 5,000 miles. One of these canals, now in
the course of construction—the Sierra Nevada—
is ten feet wide at the bottom, fourteen at the top,
and is designed, with its branches, to extend over
150 miles.
We have now in operation seventy-five quartz
mills, crushing some 295,000 tons, and realizing
#4,500,000 annually. In 1853, we sent out of
California more gold than the domestic products
exported from the whole Union amounted to
twenty-five years ago. The diminution, in
the amount exported since that period, maybe
accounted for by the fact that we now have a mint
there, at which is coined more that $20,000,000
per annum; and instead of relying upon others,
as formerly, for the necessaries of life, we are
ourselves exporters of agricultural products.
I have in my hand a statement prepared by one
of the San Francisco papers, (which! presume to
be correct, but I have no means of determining
its accuracy,) which shows our exports as follows:
Exports.—The past year will make an epoch in the his-
tory ot California, as the first in which were exported from
her shores any considerable amount of agricultural products.
It appears from a table, carefully prepared for the Morning
Herald, that the total value of exports during the year 1855
amount to #4,645,959, sent as follows:
To Australia.  #933,215
To China  668,600
To Honolulu.  480,340
To Tahiti  75,880
To Valparaiso  79,364
To Callao  362,189
To Mexico.  616,559
To New York  883,062
To Lower California    22,919
To East Indies  58,192
To Vancouver  42,376

To Liverpool  317,537
To ports in the Pacific  92,796
Total value of exports for the year 1856 #4,645,959
Instead of looking to you any longer for bread-
stuffs, we were able last year to export some
§700,000 worth of flour; and we also sent several
cargoes of wheat to New York. One would sup-
pose that this fact would suffice to show our
friends on this side of the continent that Cali-
fornia is one of the richest agricultural States in
the Union; and, notwithstanding the difference
in the price of labor, we are able to compete with
you. In the amount of smallgrain raised to the
acre, I am confident that no State in the Union
will compare with it. _ In the number of horses
and mules, California is exceeded by only fifteen
other States; whilst in cattle, she is only surpassed
by seven States. In wheat, there were only nine
States which produced more in 1855; while New
York alone produced a larger quantity of barley.
Sixteen States of the Union produced smaller
quantities of potatoes than ours, and no State
yielded so many gallons of wine. In the aggre-
gate of live stock, only fourteen States surpass us.
In 1853 there was imported into San Francisco
merchandise to the value of $100,000,000; more
than the whole amount of goods imported into
the United States fourteen years ago. In point
of commerce that city is ranked as third in our
Union, and in her harbor are usually to be seen
more vessels than in the port of any other city
of this country except New York. This city,
although five times destroyed by fire, will now
compare favorably with any other city of this Re-
public. In her schools, her churches, her public
institutions, in all that dignifies and ennobles
human nature, she has made more rapid advances
during the last five years than any other city in
the world . Located upon the best harbor on the
eastern side of the Pacific, San Francisco, the
greatest city on that coast, ere the lapse of a quar-
ter of a century—if this road be constructed—
will become the formidable rival of New York.
Indeed, I venture the prediction that, within the
lifetime of some who now hear me, the American
commerce on the Pacific will far exceed that on
the Atlantic.
" Westward the star of empire takes its way."
Ohio and Indiana, which were only a few years
ago in the extreme^ West, are now in the eastern
part of the Republic. The progressive spirit of
the age has carried American citizens, American
..capital, and American enterprise to the shores of
the Pacific, and no man can predict our future
greatness, if we hold on to that Union which has
thus far made us a free and happy people.
God grant that the hour may never arrive when
this great Republic shall be torn by factions, and
involved in the horrors of a bloody and desolat-
ing civil war! If our national emblem, which
has neve^been disgraced, never dishonored, is to
float over a divided and distracted people, I trust
it may not be until after I shall have passed to
that " bourn from whence no traveler returns."
The impetus given to commerce has increased
American tonnage from 2,461,280 tons in 1848, to
4,068,979 tons in 1855, being nearly doubled in
seven years. And within the same period it
will be found that the domestic exports nave in-
creased from §132,000,000 to $246,000,000. And
this is chiefly attributable to the discovery of.
fold in, and the settlement Of, California. When
er immense resources are fully developed, Cal-
ifornia must stand amongst the foremost States
in the Confederacy.
Great and powerful States must ere long be
formed out of the territory between the Missis-
sippi river and the State of California. The Ter-
ritories of Oregon, New Mexico, Utah, Kansas,
Nebraska, and the Indian Territory, contain an
area a fraction less than a million of square miles.
This will make twenty-five States as large as
Ohio, and thirty-three States as large as South
Carolina. I do not doubt that there are those
now in existence, who will live to see seventy-
five States happily confederated together in one
common Union, if we can only agree that each
State may manage its domestic affairs in its own
way.
This Government now owns one thousand
millions of acres of land west of the Mississippi
river. As a large landed proprietor,-therefore,
it is now called upon to contribute a portion of
this territory to the prosecution of a worl#which
passes through it. The policy of our Govern-
ment has materially changed since the first Con-
gress met under the Constitution. Then the
public lands were looked to as a source of rev-
enue from which the public debt was to be ex-
tinguished. It was then considered a, great
offense for a citizen to go upon the public land,
and attempt to reduce it to cultivation.
On the 28th of May, 1789, Mr. Scott, of Penn-
sylvania, speaking in the other branch of Con-
gress on the subject of establishing land offices,
and in regard to the occupation of the public
lands by settlers, used this language: " Will
you raise a force to drive them off? This has
been tried. Troops were raised, and sent under
General Harmar to effect this purpose. They
burnt the cabins, broke down the fences, and tore
up the potato patches; but, in three hours after
the troops were gone, these people returned again,
repaired the damages, and are now settled upon
] the lands in open defiance of the authority of'
the Union."
j Now we are running into the other extreme,
1 and giving away,under the name of bounty laws,
| valuable farms to all who have ever been subject
j to military law for fourteen days, no matter whe-
ther they performed any service or not. These
lands are no longer looked to as a source of rev-
! enue, but are regarded as property held in trust
) by the Federal Government for the benefit of the
: people. Aside from donations which should be
j made to companies and to States, for the prose-
cution of public works, the true policy would
j have been to have withheld these lands from sale,
I and given them in limited quantities to actual
1 settlers; but I will not pursue this subject.
! No one can estimate the influence of this work
I upon the commerce of the world. I have already
j spoken of the influence exercised by our settle-
ments on the Pacific coast upon the tonnage of
our country. Construct this road, and put us in
direct communication with this side of the con-
tinent, and steamships will speedily be placed on
the line between San Francisco and China and
the East Indies.
We are now equidistant between Europe and
Asia—about 5,000 miles from each. The popula-
tion of Europe is put down at 270,000,000; that
of Asia 750,000,000. It will be seen at once that
this road would be the great thoroughfare through
which the commerce of Europe and Asia must
necessarily pass. I might, with great propriety,
denominate this the great European, Asiatic, and
American highway, over which the wealth and-
riches of the East must be transported.
The overland mail from London to China is
generally out sixty-five days; and as we get our
intelligence from China, by way of England, the
English merchant enraged in the East India
trade, has ten days the advantage of the New
York merchant. Construct this road, and the
reverse will be the case. San Francisco would
then be six days distant from New York. Steam-
ers can readily perform the trip from San Fran-
cisco to Shanghai in twenty days, so that the
New York merchant, who now gets his news
from China via England in seventy-five days, will
then obtain it (if the telegraph be constructed) in
twenty or twenty-one days, which would be a
saving of fifty-five days, and for travelers it
would save forty-nine days.
These are important considerations which
ought to have their influence upon the Senate.
Our Government, Mr. President, is based upon
the confidence of the people. Its foundations
must be laid brOad and deep in their affections.
To maintain that confidence, you must deal justly,
and impartially with them. The same facilities
and the same protection which you extend to the
people of the interior must be extended to the
people of the frontier. The man who now stands
upon the shores of the far and distant Pacific
should be as secure in the enjoyment of all his,
rights, as the man whose home is in the heart of
; the Republic.
j With regard to the transportation of the mails,
you only allow us to communicate with our
brethren on this side of the continent twice a
month, whilst upon your mail routes here you'
; have mails from one to four times a day. There
is not a State in this Union, which, with the ex-
; ception of California and Texas, cannot commu-
' nicate daily with the central Government,
j Would our friends here from North Carolina,
[ who are opposing this bill, be satisfied with a
j semi-monthly mail between this city and their
State ? Would their people utter no complaints
if this invidious distinction was drawn between
them and the other States of the Union ? Besides,
we are compelled to pay ten cents postage on our
letters, while the law only imposes three cents
upon yours. I hardly think this is dealing fairly
and impartially with the people of the respective
States.
