APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

41st Cons. ...3d Sess.
Repeal of Income Tax—Mr. Stiles.
Ho. of Eeps.
orable committee, I deem it not improper briefly to
express to the committee, through you, the conclu-
sions which I have myself reached.
I regard the tax as the one of all others most
obnoxious to the genius of our people, being inquis-
itorial in its na.ture, and dragging into public view
an exposition of the most private pecuniary affairs
of the citizen.
Such an unwilling exposition can only be eora-
pulsorily effected through the maintenance of the
most expensive machinery; and both the nature of
the tax and the means necessarily employed for its
enforcement appear to bo regarded by the better
class of citizens with more and more disfavor from
year to year.
It is furthermoremostdifficult of exact statement,
especially in large business ramifications and where
long periods of time are involved in extended com-
mercial affairs.
There is some question as to its constitutionality,
but as to that I express no opinion.
The amount derived from that source has, under
thelegislation already had, been greatlydiminishcd ;
and I am so well satisfied that tho evils more than
counterbalance the benefits derived from its longer
retention, that I recommend its unconditional re-
peal.
I have the honor to bo, very respectfully, your
obedient servant,
A. PLEASONTON,
Commissioner.
Hon. Saiioki. Hoopee,
C hair man Committee of Ways and Means.
Mr. STILES. I must beg to refer at some
length to the report accompanying this letter,
and 1 prefer to have them accompany my re-
marks in the order in which the Commissioner
places,them. The number of persons assessed
for income in each of the classes below named,
as returned to this office by the assessors of
the several collection districts, from 1867 to
1870, inclusive, is as follows:
K3
M
> o <
I B 2
! ST"
These returns are made under act of March
2, 18G7, which provides that the amount of
exemption shall be $1,000.
The first two classes are entirely relieved
from tax under act of July 14, 1870, by the
raising of the exemption from $1,000 to §2,000.
If we suppose the average tax of the first class
to be fifteen dollars, and of ,the second class
forty dollars per head, we have—
103,550 at $15 $1,583,250
65,678 at $10   2,623.120
Total $4,206,370
the aggregate tax lost in the first and second
classes.
Each person in the three remaining classes
will pay fifty dollars les3 per annum under
$2,000 exemption than under $1,000 exemp-
tion. Then $4,804,100 (96,082X$50=$4,804,-
100) lost in the third, fourth, and fifth classes,
added to $4,206,370, gives $9,010,470—the
aggregate tax lost ou incomes from individ-
uals, (salary tax excepted,) by the change in
the amount of exemption.
The aggregate income tax collected from
individuals was:
In 1867, on the incomes of 1866 S27.418.000
In 1868, on the incomes of 1867...'.  23.390,000
In 1869, on tho incomes of 1868  27.353,000
In 1870, on the incomes of 1839  26,150,000
Average 526,077,750
The tax collected on salaries was—
In 1867  $1,029,902
In 1868  1.043.501
In 1869  561,963
Iu 1870 *  1,103,526
Average  $936,260
This amount is thirty-five per cent, of
$26,077,750. Assuming that the loss on sala-
ries of United States officers and employ6s is
proportionate to that on incomes from other
individuals, $327,691 are lost from this source,
($936,260X.35=$327,691.) This sum added
to $59,010,470 gives $9,338,161, the total loss
on incomes from individuals by the raising of
the exemption from $1,090 to $2,000. De-
ducting this amount from $26,077,750, the
average of the aggregate tax collected, we have
$10,739,589, and after reducing this one half
for the change in the rate of tax there remains
$8,369,794 as the aggregate tax from individ-
uals under act of July 14, 1870.
The aggregate five per cent, tax returned on
the dividends and additions, to surplus funds
of banks, railroad companies, &c., enumer-
ated in sections one hundred and twenty and
one hundred and twenty-two, act of June 30,
1864, was—■
For 1867 $7,943,797
For 1868  8.384,426
For 1869  9.204,824
For 1870    9,551,301
Average  f8,771,087
One half this sum, or $4,383,543, would
then be the aggregate tax from this source.
This, added to $8,369,794, gives, in round
numbers, $12,755,000 as the approximate
receipts from incomes under act of July 14,
1870, based on the average returns of the last
four years.
1 make reference to this statement to show
that the Commissioner of Internal Revenue
has carefully presented the whole subject, and
by his showing the whole system of income
tax, as to the amount realized and the number
of persons who pay it, is a fraud and a cheat,
and we may well say with him it is " obnox-
ious to the genius of our institutions," and
ought to be repealed. As I desire to present
statements that are official rather than my
own, I will refer also to a statement of Gen-
eral Pleasonton, furnished to Senator Scott,
of my State, iu which it appears that, of the
number of persons assessed for income under
the old law, 275,248, raising the exemption
from $1,000 to $2,000, will relieve entirely
from the payment of any income tax 180,925,
leaving but 94,323 in the United States liable
to be assessed under the present law. Our
population will exceed 38,000,000, yet less
than 100,000 will be liable to pay this tax. In
the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
1870, the expenses of collecting the internal
revenue are given as follows:
Collecting   $2,120,771 84
Administering office  1,132,585 68
Assessing  4,448,770 00
$7,702,127 52
The expense of collecting this tax is greater
than that of all others, and it is believed
that the swarms of assessors now employed
could be dispensed with, reducing the ex-
penses $2,500 per day and dismissing at least
five hundred political office holders that now
grow upon what they feed on. It is impos-
sible to ascertain exactly what amount finds
its way into the public Treasury; but, sir, I
believe it is safe to say that more than one
third of all this tax is eaten up in high salaries;
and the statement has just been made by the
gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Morgan] that from
official reports on file in this House there are
balances against more than three hundred ex-
collectors, and that ten of them stand charged
as defaulters to the amount of $6,000,000.
The total amount of the losses through default-
ing collectors perhaps can never be known.
We have tried by resolutions to get this inform-
ation, one of which was passed, but it was
never answered. We do not know what sums
of the money of the people are in the hands
of these defaulting collectors. In the lights
before us, Mr. Speaker, would it not be safe
to express an opinion that one half of all the
moneys collected under this income tax law
never finds its way into the Treasury?
Among the thousands of assessors and col-
lectors you must necessarily find dishonest
officers. Abolish the cause of these defalca-
tions. Strike out this tax from our statutes ;
and if there be no other cause of relief brought
to the people by your administration of the
Government, you will at least merit some praise
for such a wise and just act.
Mr. Speaker, if I am able to judge public
sentiment by the press and the general voice
of the people through conventions and public
assemblages, I think 1 can say without fear of
contradiction that the State of Pennsylvania,
through its Representatives, demands a repeal
of this law. Its Senators clamor for its repeal,
and Senator Scott is the champion of the foes
of this unconstitutional and inquisitorial law.
My Radical colleagues all at one time seemed
to be with us on this question. But, sir, I was
surprised, when the chairman ofthe Committee
of Ways and Means moved in the House afew
days since to go into committee for the pur-
pose of considering the resolution abolishing
the income tax, to find five of my Radical
colleagues, Messrs. Cessna, Dickey, Mercur,
Negley, and Packer, voting against the mo-
tion. The vote was upon a test question, and
stood—104 ayes, 105 noes. A change of one
vote would have taken us in committee ; and
with a majority, as we might have had, had
the Radicals from Pennsylvania voted with
their committee-man upon the Ways and
Means, [Mr. Kelt,by,] this law could have
been blotted out forever. But I was more
surprised to find in the Associated Press report
the following note immediately below the vote :
"Severalof thcPennsylvania members requested
the reporter to state that they voted 'no,' because
the bill to repeal the income tax was so far down on
the Calendar that in their opinion it could not bo
reached. Among these bills were a bill to reduce
the duty on imports, a bill to abolish the duty ou
coal, a bill to authorize the issue of convertible
bonds, and the bill to reduce tho duties on imported
salt. Besides this, the bill itself could havo been
amended by adding or attaching any tariff bill that
might have been offered."
Thus, sir, was the motion defeated ; and now,
as the close of the session draws near, there
is scarely a hope for reaching a vote upon this
question, althougha majority of the committee
have recommended action during this Con-
gress. I charge upon my Radical colleagues
that they could have changed this result.
Mr. NEGLEY. Will the gentleman allow
me to say a word there?
Mr. STILES. My colleague, who rises to
interrupt me, I presume was one of the Repub-
licans who made that request ofthe reporters.
I will now hear tho gentleman.
Mr. NEC-LEY. 1 did not make the request;
but 1 ihd vote Kga'nist going into Committee
