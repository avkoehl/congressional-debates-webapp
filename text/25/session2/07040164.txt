•said, as to the views and designs enteitamed by the
leading raembeio of that party, he begged permis-
sion to lead a passage from the memoirs ot Mr
Jetferson, m w hich he comments on the tendency
and effect of the financial system proposed by Gen
Hamilton in seventeen hundred and nmetj-one,
who was then Secretary of the Treasury. He says
on that subject:
" I know well, andeo must bo undeii>luod, that iiiithin¿ like

Here, said Mr B «o have sketched, with a pen-
cil of light, the motives and canses which ga\c n*e
to that first fatal depaitma of out Government from
the punciples and thcoiy of its written Constitution,
and which, so tar as the machinery ot the enure
paper system could influence its action, had been
verging neaier and neaier the British model spoken
of ever since ik, origin, unless when checked in its
tendency by the resistance of Republican adminis-
trations. The liberties of the country, and ilsfioc
institutions, were now literally groaning beneath the
accumulated weight of banking monopolies The
prediction,soexultwgly uttered by the youngt rl'iti,
many years ago, that the funding and papci system
xvould prove fatal to our Republic, seems to be on
the point of beingreah/ed The mcasuie pio] used
by the friends oí the Administration, is the only t ne
which can reclaim om original eonstilotion-il n hb,
stay the maicli of thu mighty inundation of lunk
powei and influence, and save the free institution'
of the countiy liom bemgoverw'hilme ¡, m its ripitl
and almost resistless progress Xhc nran objtoii n,
which had been urged by those opp ised to it p-ir-
took of that distinctive clmactcr, jealousy ami it s
trust of the people, which be had shown as belong-
ing to oae of the political parties in tins country, in
its ongin, and in all its subsequent changes It
was an objection, which, by deny ing the existence
of sufficient honesty and intelligence to the c n/i ns
of this country to execute its financial dfl.ins.uithi tit
the intervention of banking corporations, vent to
the competency of the people to govern tlmnseli'f Tne
great argument on w Inch llio capacity of the pe< pit
to govern fhcnuelves re-is, is their suppo id hones-
ty and intelligence If public tiüVci cannot be
selected fiom the great mass of our citizens, who
are both faithful and capable, t!i*n it would sC, m
to follow, as a necessary consequence/iorn ¡hi it
gumenr, mainly relied on by ecutlemen in oppos.-
tion, that the country was destitute of those vnlius
and of that intelligence, indispensable li> enihlc its
citizens, to govern themselves It could not fail,
therefore, to a.tiae.t oui atlentmn,that this main ob-
jection had lis origin m the earliest dms'on of pir-
ties in this country, founded on a d s'ui t of the
people, and h?d, on all the great leading questions
of policy and construction of the Constitution, been
the point at which the two parlies had almo t uni-
formly separated.
It is an objection, not only at -variance with the
foundation principles of oif Government, wh ch,
in its theory, supposes that its ciuz ns are inii-
ciemly honest and capab'c to oviy out, m ofinul
trusts, ad the pn tpis and 'uti s v-i'h wlinh il >
charged, bal t is i < irect insult to th-  n.^ral tr -
of the countrv,i} .'ocarín , .11 effect, t'ra' the
standard of individual honor, ?nd honesty, is below
that of bankingcorpoiations, «hose course of ac-
tion is mainly influenced by motives of cupidity
and self-interest.
Mr. B had heard, with no little surprise, the
measure, contemplated m the bill, denounced as
fianght with moie dange. than any which had been,
at any time, proposed under our Government, and
as being more odious than the alien and se>dition
law This kind of assault had become too com-
mon to produce much impression, at this time of
day It had been the fate of almost every great
measure, no matter how ninth recommended by
considerations of public good, to cneounlei the same
harsh language, ami miny of those seiy measures

tine 1 ' it 1  y fie well doubted, thelbri the
Govt rue 1 nt ha a^th 1 ty to employ them as fiscal
tpenfs, because it is eleirly the exeie se of an offi-
cial powir, «hich fhe Constitution limits,, accord-
ing to every sound and fair rule of construction, to
be executed through the agency of its own
" officers "
The appointing powei is clearly an Executive
function, under the limitations and restric-
tions imposed on it by the Constitution. The
second section of that instrument is the source,
and only source, from which the authori-
ty of thePiesident, to make official appointments,
is derived, to that branch of fhe Government, and
is as follows
"He shall have power, by and with the advice
anil consent of the Senate, to make treaties, pro-
vided iwo-lhnds of the Senators present concur,
ainllie shall nominate, arid by and with the advice
and eon«ent ot the Senate, shall appoint, ambassa-
tlm s, othei ministers, and consuls, judges of the
Supiemc Couit, and all other officers of the United
Slates, whose appointments are not heron oihei-
wre provided for, and which shall be established
bylaw. But fhe Congress may, by law, vest ihe
appointment of such uifenor officers, as they think
piopt 1, 111 the President alone, in the courts of law,
or in the heads of departments."
Ileie, then, we have the extent and bieadth of
the Executive authority to make appointments and,
undei it, "officers" constitute the only class oí pub-
lic agents he is authorized to appoint, to exe-
cute public trusts If that sound and universally
admitted rule of constiuction be correct, in expound-
ing the Constitution, that when a power js, m ex-
piess temis, contened m that instalment, it is,
in effect, a negative of all other power notgmen., then
it follows that the provision of the Constitution,
which he had cited, by designating "oiheers" as
the official .vents to be appointed by the President,
locaiiy into cfleel the laws, necessarily excludes
I loin the range ol his selection banking coipora-
ti his to pertoimoffici.il duties, because, ex m ler-
mini, tht v cannot, in the sense of the Constitution,
be consitleietl as "ofluot-." The lecciving, sale-
k(f ping, antl disbursing ihe public money, is clear-
1\ the perfoimance of an ofiicial tluty, by whatso-
t\ei agency jierlormt if To the Executive branch
of the Governmsnt belongs, and alone belongs, un-
der certain lestitctions, the power of appointing
ofiicial agents, to perform public trusts Can he,
therefore, appoint any other than that class of
public   agents   leeogmsed   by   the   Constitution'
That the iramars of the Constitution never once
thought of banking corporations tor such agency,
and intended for their revenue and iitiantc laws to
be executed by any othei class ot agents, except
tin ouch the olliters of the Government, he believ-
id, «is not only most apparent from 'hat msliii-
mtnt itseti, but that opinion was strongly lortifled
by the doctrines expressed in the able and orthodox
mimbeis written in defence of that instrument by
Madison, Hamilton, and Jay In those, ol the
mimbi n ielc rred to, which treat of the taxing and
fm.int id powers conferred on the Goveramint, by
tin Constitution, no othei desenpt on of agents is
mention! tl,'nr alluded to, who were to cairy mlo ef-
fi ot those trusts, but officers Such was not only
then the construction of the Constitution, by its
friends, but Us opponents also, who weie ever on
th" alert to find objections, and to magnify its
powers, lor the purpose of preventing its adoption,
in 1, on n > occasion, so far as the essays and de-
bates ol those tunes inform us, conjectured that
b inking oorpoiatjons were to be employed as a part
ol the fiscal machinery of the Government. It it
had, foi a moment, been suspected, by that great
mastei-spint, ¡n the Viigmia convention, of those
who ( pposed its adoption, that the Government was

ful moneyed corpora'^on , either of its own

great pi mcipl s which he now touched, on thissub-
Jict, bail not been much in fashion for many years
pist, and that much of the practice, under the Go-
vernment, since it had gone into operation, was m
opposition to them He considered them as the
loundation principles of our Government, winch
