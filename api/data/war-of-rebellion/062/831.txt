Major-General MAGRUDER,

Commanding, &amp; c.:

GENERAL: General Smith directs that you will strengthen General McCulloch to the utmost extent your disposable force will admit. That you will instruct Brigadier-General McCulloch to prepare every man that he can make disposable for active operations, in order to enable him to re-enforce or co-operate with Brigadier-General Maxey, should circumstances require it. The enemy having evacuated Alexandria, so soon as the Red River Valley, is clear of him the general commanding proposes to make an active campaign toward the Arkansas Valley.

General Maxey has been directed to hold himself in readiness to co-operate by an advance toward Fort Smith.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I must respectfully represent the urgent necessity of placing the whole under the control and guidance of some one who can control and direct them systematically.

As there are none of the enemy's troops in that portion of the State, which has been greatly infested with jayhawkers, I had intended to use the Fourth Regiment of Cavalry for the purpose of ridding the country south of Rapides of these outlaws and arresting and returning to their commands all deserters [that] could be found. If, however, you have ordered the State Guard on that duty it will not be necessary to keep Colonel Bush in that section, and I can use his regiment to advantage elsewhere. I would therefore be glad if you would inform me if the disposition referred to of the State Guard
