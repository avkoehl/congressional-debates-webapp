Abingdon. He also states that he an uncle on General Williams' staff; that his uncle told him that General Ransom had started an infantry force, via Morrison Gap, to join Wheeler, Pegram &amp;c., at Cumberland Gap, and when that junction was effected there the force at Abingdon under Major General William E. Jones and Hampton were to move down in this direction. I give you this for what it is worth. He says General William E. Jones and Hampton came with the re-enforcements. I think I will be able by night to give you some definite information in relation to the enemy.

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE,Iuka, October 26, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

Your corps report is received. I am forced to draw from your corps every man that can possibly be spared. Three hundred men at Paducah, 2,000 at Columbus, 3,500 at Memphis, 3,000 at Corinth, and 2,000 at intermediate points of the railroad must suffice for the present. This makes 10,000. Your report shows 23,000, besides the troops in Arkansas, some of which may be reasonably expected.

I want you to organize a strong division under General Dodge, of at least 8,000 effectives, and put them as quick as possible at Eastport or Florence, to follow the Fifteenth Army Corps. You can use the railroad now exclusively, as I will trust to the river. Do you want to remain at Memphis or to take the field? Telegraph and write me fully your wishes. I send you tomorrow General Grant's letter, which makes the foregoing a necessity.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, October 26, 1863.

Brigadier General ROBERT ALLEN,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

General Sherman directs that all stores and supplies for the Fifteenth Corps be sent by the Tennessee River.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, October 26, 1863.

Brigadier General G. M. DODGE,

Corinth, Miss.:

GENERAL: I send General Stevenson to you for assignment to command. It will probably be well for you to break your force into two divisions, and give him the eastern one. Any arrangement you may make of this kind will be approved by me.

Your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
