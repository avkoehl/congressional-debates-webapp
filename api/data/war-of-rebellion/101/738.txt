HEADQUARTERS FIRST BRIGADE, RESERVE CORPS,

MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,

Kenner, La., February 4, 1865.

Captain JOHN F. LACEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Forces:

CAPTAIN: In consequence of the dense fog and the heavy draft of the vessels, I regret to report that it will be impossible to make arrangements for embarking the troops as early to-morrow morning as we supposed. The captain of the Peabody says that he must have daylight in which to work, and will hardly be ready for the troops to embark before 8 a. m. He also reports that his hold is full of commissary stores, and that it will be impossible to take any wagons, and if we put our stock aboard he cannot carry all the men assigned him. Whether these troubles are imaginary and will vanish before an energetic effort, I cannot say. I deem it my duty to communicate them, assuring you at the same time that no effort will be spared on my part to complete the embarkation and get away at the earliest possible moment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. McLAUGHLIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel Forty-seventh Indiana Volunteers, Commanding.
