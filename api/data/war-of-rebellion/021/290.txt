Diana went up Teche on reconnaissance to-day about 12 o'clock. soon after heavy firing heard for an hour. Calhoun started and is now fast aground in Grand Lake near Bayou Sorrel. Estrella is at nought of Atchafalaya; have sent for her. Nothing had of Diana.

BAYOU BOEUFF, March 28, 1863.

GENERAL: I ordered the Diana by the Grand Lake route to make a reconnaissance. I sent two companies of infantry and one of my aides to make it secure. Instead of taking the route I ordered, for some unaccountable reason they went by the Atchafalaya, right in the teeth of the enemy. I believe she and all on board are gone. The calhoun going to her relief got aground; went without a pilot, because Government drove off all our pilots by insufficiency of pay. The Estrella started down to pilot in the boats and is 40 miles off. The wind is favorable to get the Calhoun off, but unfavorable to communicate with the Estrella. Just hurry on the Indiana battery with ammunition and I am right, even if they get all my boats.
