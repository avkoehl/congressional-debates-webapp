Washington City, March 14, 1865.

Lieutenant- General GRANT:

If Canby has been distinctly notified of Your wishes in respect to the command of the Thirteenth Corps and disregarded them Your dissatisfaction would be well founded, but I think it will turn out differently. In that impression I forwarded him myself your last telegram to General Halleck last week. In respect to superseding him in command your views will be fully acquiesced in whenever you choose to make a change. I will start for City Point to see you on this and otehre matters to- morrow.

Secretary of War.

Lieutenant- General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

Your dispatch of March 1 was duly submitted to the Secretary of War, but I am not aware that any action was taken, General Canby having been previously instructed to nominate his corps commanders, as has usually been done to other generals.

Refugees from East Louisiana report many troops going home on furlough. They are mostly Texas troops and cross the river near Rodney. This confirms the previous reports from Natchez in regard to Texas troops trying to cross the river to get home. I have the honor to be, very respectfully, Your obedient servant,
