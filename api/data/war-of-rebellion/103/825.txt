VI. The One hundred and fifty-first Illinois Infantry, Colonel F. B. Woodall commanding, will proceed without delay to Chattanooga, Tenn., and report to Major General J. B. Steedman, commanding District of the Etowah, to whose command it is assigned.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

SOUTHARD HOFFMAN,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

GRAVELLY SPRINGS, [March] 4, 1865-6 p.m.

(Received 7th.)

Major-General THOMAS:

Telegrams of the 1st instant received. The rain-storm just ended was the most violent of the season. The Tennessee is now higher than for many years and rising rapidly. It will be utterly impossible to get off to-morrow, though I shall use every possible effort to expedite the movement. My command is in splendid condition and will start at the earliest possible moment after it can cross the river. It is fair to presume this rain has been generally diffused and will delay General Canby's movements, those from Memphis and Vicksburg certainly, as much as mine. I will keep you daily informed of all that transpires.

J. H . WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Bvt. Brigadier General E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, U. S. Army:

SIR: I have the honor to recommend and request that Bvt. Brigadier Gens. E. F. Winslow and A. J. Alexander be assigned to duty with rank, pay, and emoluments of their brevet rank. This request is made as a reward to meritorious officers, and because the interests of the service require that they shall be assigned to commands over officers less worthy, but of superior actual rank.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
