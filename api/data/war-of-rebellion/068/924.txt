HDQRS. ARTILLERY BRIGADE, FIFTH CORPS,May 19, 1864.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

GENERAL: As far as I can discover, there is no force of the enemy this side of the river. They have ceased to cross the works as mentioned in my last. I am all right and supply reported the movement of the enemy for the information of your headquarters.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. HOWARD KITCHING,

Colonel Sixth New York Artillery, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARTILLERY BRIGADE,May 19, 1864.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: Our pickets are being driven in on the right. Do not know the force, but it must be quite large as our picket was strong.

Very respectfully, &c.,

J. HOWARD KITCHING,

Colonel Sixth New York Artillery, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 19, 1864-7.15 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

My line is established with General Warren's left, and running southerly at the start, bends gradually in southwest direction. One division is on the right of the Anderson Mill road and two on the left. The skirmish line on the right is hard up against the enemy. The left I am moving forward, and shall throw the left of my main line forward if practicable. The enemy's line in front of my left is reported to be on a thickly wooded crest less than half a mile distant. Movements have been slow in consequence of the difficult nature of the country, which is densely wooded.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 19, 1864-4 p.m.

Major-General WRIGHT:

What is the length of the line occupied by your corps, and how much of your force is in line, and how much in reserve? I ask because, from a sketch of the engineers, it does not appear that you occupy ground proportionate to your strength.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
