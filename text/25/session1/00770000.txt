Ps he was mfoimed, the conduc*of that gentleman

Mi LOOMIS thought the attack upo i those gen
tlemen was nnpio ei, because of their mililitv to
defend themseh cs and because that e\ erj th ng
which was said h to was caught up and pi omul-
gated through the thousand papers of the counliv
They sufTei under the attacks, and have no means
of being heaid He should have suppospd that all
this feeling w ould have been smothered oi forgot-

Mi. WISE! said hp intended, when he was up
' befoie, to do justice to the majority ot the com-
mittee, and to the gentleman fiom Penns} Ivania
(Mi Muhlenberg) especially It might hp thought
by some that his remaiks conveyed the idea that
his fiiend Gcneial Campbell íeally resisted the ma-
jo ity That idea, how ever, was wrong It was
due to the gentleman from Pennsjhama to saj
that he c mdemned the report when it was fir t
presented Mr Pence, of Rhode Is and also said
that he did not coicui in it, so that tneie was no
necessity whatever lot lisistmgt le mijontj Wh°n

it-ei.il in such a character that the majority ex-
piessed then reprehension of it He íecollected
most distinctly, that his fnend fiom Pennsylvania
(Mr Muhlenberg)—lor he must «nil call that gen-
Ik *nan his friend, as also many of those who be-
longed to the administration pan —condemned it

Mi CVMBRELDNC-r won'el with the p i mis-

passed, the act t a tu the meiehai s purei si „
these drafts, and the acti m ol the barwa m conse-
quence of the passage ot that bill, the Ti easu y w as
actually deprived at once of all the funds now in
bank th oughout the United States, and deprived
of all its resources-to meet the expendituies of the
present year On this ground, therefore, he ap-
pealed to the committee to sa} how long this Go-
v erament could be supported, depending as it now
did on the trifling cash receipts for lands and
rev enue
Mr C added that he had been mfoimed they
had even been compelled to return thirty thousand
dollars from the Treasury to the custom-house at
Naw Yoik, to pay debentuies andcunent expenses
Untler these encumstances, he thought he might
confidently appeal to gentlemen on all sides of the
Hjuse loi then concurrence m a moie prompt
action upon the various bills befojre the House
Mi SMITH, who was entitled to the floor,
(liuvnig tcmpoiaul} yielded it to Mr Cambreleng;
exjHossed his regret that his honoiable colleague
(Mr Pairfield) jesterda}, should have gone baek
to the period of the passage of the deposite act ot
183C Now Mi S had contributed his humble
share to that measure, and at no subsequent mo-
ment had he seen occasion to regret that course
He asked to whom, or to what, the' weie now in-
debted for not having thirty -seven millions of una
vailable funds mstGad ot nine, but to tne fnends
of tnat measuie, and to the measure itself?
In regard to the amendment pending, if it had
been oiigmally mseited in the bill from thp Senate,
he should hive voted lor it, but he was opposed to
it now v ith the provisei, because it made a geneial
r cognition of the s}5tem of distiiliititm The bill
t f the House he objected to because it was a vn-
wl, and m fact a positive, i peal ol the
distiibution of the fouith instalment, under
covei of a postponement He maintained that
the deposite act was not a contiact, nor that
it did, in any degiee, partake of any of the legal
or moi al obligations of an nstrument of that cha-
íacter He assented, in pait, to the cases put
}e leiday b) the gentleman fiom New Hampshire,
(Mr Cushman,) but supplied a defect m them, by
putting the case of a promise of tw o hundred thou-
sand dolíais, and between the time of promise
a id that of pa} meat, it v as found to fall shoit of
the amount >L the fouith pa}mtnt oi instalment
In this ease theie would be nothci moni no* leg, 1
obligation to fulfil the proposition The law was
pa'sed undo the suppes timi that theie was a sui-
plus, and the money was rpccived under that same
supposition, and that a'oi c and tl e moment it
w is asceitained that no smplus exis ed, both pti-
tles weie relieved fron  the obli° itions ot thp }u \
