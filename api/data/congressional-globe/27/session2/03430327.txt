State Senator of Pennsylvania If it pleased the President to
remove the First \_uditor from office for opinion's sake, because
he had been the political opponent of William Henry Harrison
and John Tyler, he would be peifectly satisfied, if he snould
displace him to make room for a Whig he should have no ob
jectione But asa Pennsylvaman, he would not hear a man
who at home ma ntained a sound charactei, pronounced cur
rupt, guilty of a vio'ation oflaw and gioss negligence n the
discharge of hi« offitial duty, without holding up his voice
against it when he believed there was not evidence on record,

Mr IRWIN said, pel haps the committee was right <■ ü i or
haps he was wrong All that hesaid was tha , Iron the state of
facts as disclosed in the reporto' thegentleman liom Virginia,
his mind had notainved at the same conclusion as the com
rmttee had who made the chirge of a culpable neglect of duty
by this officer If there had been an omission of duty on
the part ol the Auditor it rmaht be pioper tha the Presi
dent should remove hirr fi on  office fortius ran e for the sake
of example If a s ntmel is found sleeping on his post it is a
good rule—a good milkaiy lule—to ad i it ol 10 excuse, al
though the ¡elinquent might plead foi m lev on the seme of
physical exhaustion or of inability, owing to the oueious na

No suspicion entérame 1 in New York, of the guilty man,
where a vigilant paity press—a vigilant political enemy was
watching him Although Mr Miller might have been guilty
of COirtiptionor a culpable neglect of duty,the evidenceof his
guilt as presented m the íeport was not sufficient to convince
him (Mi I) of his suilt This was all he said and all he con
tended foi If the Whigpaity desired thehead of this manto
be chopped oil, ho could witness his execution without a parti
cle of emotion Let him be lemoved because he opposed the
election of Harrison and Tyler, but do not stigmatize him as a
corrupt officer lío no* heap odium on his children The gen
tleman from Virginia did not charge him with corruption, but
other members had it went forth to the world, and would be
quoted to'tbat man's children and wife He expressed his so
lemn belief, derived fiom evidences whichcould be relied on,
t hat however wrong lesse Miller might he'as a politician, and as
a partisan, yet he was an honest man and a vigilant officer He
expressed that ct nviction
Here was a man who had been charged with culpable neglect
of duty, and the odium of reiammg that man in office was to be
settled on John Tyler He would ask, i! this man were so
bad and so unworthy, why the lamented Harrison did not in
stanfiy remove him? VVhy^ Thomas Ewing did not recom
mend his removal?
Mr STANLY said he bad heard fiom good authority that he
did
Mr IRWIN said he had heaid from good authority that Tho
mas Ewmg did no' so recommend, bul, on thecontrary, that his
retention met his[Mr E's] approbation Mr Miller came fiom
his State and they could present as many applicants for office
as any State perhaps, except New York—
The CHAIRMAN called the gentleman to older
Mr IRVvTN continued Did ihe present worthy Secretary
of the Treasury recommend his removal? Mr Miller came
fiom Pennsylvania, and there were Whig members from that
State—gentlemen who had done service in the late Piesidential
canvass and made honorable sacrifices of tim*1 and money Had
a man of them asked the President to remove this man? If
s i, he would ask what reason was as igned foi ihe removal,
and who was propo«ed m his place? Under thesecncumslances
was the Presi lent of the United Sta'es to be condemned for not
chopping off the head of this officer su Idenly? He cared not for
l his man individually—he cared not if he wasremoved to mor
row All ihat he desired wasthatjusuce without mercy, mere
sheei justice, might be dealt even lo the most obnoxious of his
political opponents They had condemned Andrew lackson for
his indiscriminate use of the power of removal, they had con
demned Van Buren—
TheCHAIRMAN requested the gentleman to confine his re
m<irk   t   the que tion before the committee
Mr IRWIN it-led if it became them to condemn without
mercy every instance m which a political opponent m gh be
r 'awed in powti, vithuut reference to the exigencies if the
department, in which the services of an individual, on account
of his experience and knowledge, might be deemed necessary?
Were they to say, remove them all—not giadually, hut in
stall tly strike down every man who had dared to differ with them
in political sentiment, although the service of the country might
suffer thereby'

Engrossed bill for the relief of Thankful Reynolds, andm
favor"of Mary Snow, were read the third time, and passed
On motion of Mr MERRICK, the Senate proceeded to the
consideration of his piopoeition to establish, as an additional
joint rule, that no amendment shall be made m either House to
the general appropriation bills, except to cai ry out objects pro-
vided foi byexisting'laws, except for contingent expenses and
compensation to persons employed by thetwo Houses
The question being on the adoption of the rule, Mr WOOD-
BRIUG E demanded the yeas and nays
Mr LINN remarked that at the called session an appropria-
tion for the Western frontier was refused, on the ground that no
estimates had been before the committee which had charge of
the subieci,and that an appropriation was not specially recom
mended by the department He would inquire of the Senator
from Maryland [Mr Mekrick] whether an appropriation for
defensive works in that quarter, of that character, coming from
the House as an amendment to the general appropriation bill,
would be considerei by himasm the meaning of ihe reso u ion.
If it was the design of the resolution to cut them oft from
making appropriations for the defences ofthe Western frontier,
he certainly would not vote for it
Mr MERRICK said the rule would íestrict the amendments
proposed, to ohiects contemplated by existing laws
Mi SEVIER inquired whether, in excluding amendments
forobjecis not au horized by existing law, the Senator con-
sidered that a proposition to appropriate 8100,000 for the con-
tinuation of the Cumberland Road would, undei this rule, be
excluded from the appiopnationbills
Mr MERRICK remarked that the Senator from Aikansas
was as well capable olj udging as he was whether that was an
object authorized by the provisions of existing law or not
Mr SEVIER remarked that by the rule .proposed to be esta-
blished, if estimates or lecommendations were not sent in from
the Departments for any particular fort or other work of defence,
however indispensable it might be for the interest oi honoi of
the country, no amendment could be introduced to the appro,
pnation bill, covering such object He saw no good reason why
Congress should not u°e some discretion, and wJiere defences
wfrre found to be necessaiy, lo appropuate money, whether
there were estimates or recommendations from-the Depart
menis or not He moved to lay the resolution on the table, but
withdrew the motionat the instanceof
Mr 10UNG, who, followed by Mr LINN, showed how the
rule would operate to cut off appropriations foi the Western
and Southwestern frontiers They showed that the only way
they can get apppropnatiens to the new States, and particularly
the West, was bv appending amendments to the appropriation
blUs And that if it should turn out that some appropriation,
the necessity of which was not foreseen, and ihe cbject of which
was not provided for hy existing law, and was absolutely ne
cessaiy lot the defence of the country, yet, by thi« rule because
there was no recommendation fium the Depattmeits and no pie
existing law auihonzmg it, no amendment could be made totl e
general appropriation bill covering the object Thciulewould
not operate at all to the mpiry of those on the northern borders
Thev have headvantage for it seems whelher appropriations
be proposed foi their harbors, fortifications or the navy, th<y
would he in order, as they would always be m accoi lance with
pre existing law Those from ihe West would cut themselves
off by voting foi the resolution Messrs loiiva and I ink
wereinfa\or of retrenchment and ecommy, a>d opposed^

their sanction to a i ule that would cut their section of coun

Mr MERRICK defended his re«olution fill the expnfttion of
