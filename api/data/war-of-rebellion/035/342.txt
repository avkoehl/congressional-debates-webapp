TRIUNE, VIA LA VERGNE,

May 19, 1863-10 a.m.

General GARFIELD:

The enemy's infantry have not advanced beyond Unionville as late as last evening. There seems no room for doubt that there is one division, and only one, at that place. It is said to be McCown's division.

SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

LA VERGNE, May 19, 1863.

Colonel GEORGE E. FLYNT,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff:

My cavalry have thoroughly scouted the country along Stone's River, but can hear of no enemy nearer than Lebanon, with exception of a few scouts. I shall explore the country east of the river in force with a forage train day after to-morrow, unless you send me orders.

JAMES B. STEEDMAN,

Brigadier-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, May 19, 1863-11.30 a.m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

The President has been asked to add that part of Kentucky between the Cumberland and the Mississippi to your Department. For military purposes, it seems to me, that these counties should belong to General Grant's department. I submit the matter, however, for your opinion.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

LEXINGTON, KY., May 19, 1863-11.50 a.m.

General BURNSIDE:

The following received from Mount Vernon:

I will answer your message about taking and holding Cumberland Gap by mail. I have intelligence from Harlan County that the cavalry force of rebels that were in Harlan have gone toward Perry County, saying they were going to Mount Sterling; said to be 1,000. I have ordered a scout from Manchester toward Hazard to ascertain the facts.

GILBERT.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., May 20, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Murfreesborough:

The President desires to know whether you have any late news from Grant, or any of the operations on the Mississippi. If you have, please report.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
