III. The cavalry corps of Major-General Stoneman will guard the roads from the east of Cass Station, and also all the roads leading from the east to this place until all the trains shall have passed, of which they will be informed by Colonel Boyd.

By command of Major-General Schofield:

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH CORPS,Between Old and New Stilesborough, May 24, 1864.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL: The head of my column is now ahead of General Geary's and lying between Old and New Stilesborough, waiting for the cavalry to get out of the way. I think our advance on Burnt Hickory would be facilitated by the withdrawal of the cavalry. My march has been on General Geary's right, and not interfering with him at all.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Sly's Mill, May 24, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have reached this point without any opposition except from a small cavalry force on the Alabama road. This place is where the road leading to Acworth turns off from the road on which I have moved. Two of my divisions will be here to-night, and the third at the crossing of the Alabama road. General Stoneman reports rebel cavalry about Cass Station this p.m.; had scattered one of his brigades, and it was rumored had captured one of my trains; this last I regard as impossible, for the train was guarded by a strong regiment of infantry. I will move toward Burnt Hickory early in the morning.

Respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIV., TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS,Near Kickstown Road, May 24, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Corps:

GENERAL: I have my division in position about half a mile beyond where the troops are to turn off for Burnt Hickory. Have met the enemy's cavalry in small force ever since I left you at Richland Creek. At one time since I got into position here skirmishing was quite brisk, and I lost 1 man killed. All is quiet now. Shall I stay here till further orders from you, or shall I move on after Generals Cox's and Hovey's divisions pass without further orders?

I am, general, yours, truly,

MILO S. HASCALL,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
