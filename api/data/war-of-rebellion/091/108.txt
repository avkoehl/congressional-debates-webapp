The rebels, about 400 strong, came in to Back Creek to-day, about one hour after the iron-clad had left, and burnt the brigade. They then started by the Warm Springs road, and told citizens they were going to burn Sleep Creek bridge. They are reported well mounted all well armed. The men at Sleepy Creek are safe this a. m., 19th, what orders for them?
