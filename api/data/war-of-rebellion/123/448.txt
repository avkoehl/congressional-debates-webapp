Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

The Department has been informed to-day that a battery has been raised in Cleveland under your authority by Captain Shields, and that you have recently directed it to be disbanded. Although no authority was given by the Department for raising artillery, yet to prevent disappointment you State. Have you received that telegram, and do you design to disband the Cleveland battery?

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

I had given orders but for three batteries, Cleveland, Portsmouth, and Dayton. The authority you gave me by telegraph yesterday provides for these cases and saves Captain Shields.

DAVID TOD,

Governor.
