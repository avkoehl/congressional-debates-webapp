tween Augusta and the Fitzhugh plantation where you may deem it best to graze your stock. You will, until further orders from these headquarters, be in command of all troops in the immediate neighborhood of your camp. You will use every exertion in your power to suppress jayhawking and stealing summarily with all persons who may be caught when the proof is sufficient to convict them. You will arrest all soldiers who are absent from their commands without proper passes. All passes must be approved by the brigade commanders. Soldiers who are absent without proper passes will be arrested and sent to Jacksonport, to be confined in jail until released by the brigadier-general commanding. You will picket all important approaches to your camp, also the various ferries on White River below your camp as far down as Peach Orchard Bluff, should Colonel Jackman have withdrawn his pickets from that line. You will shoot down all persons caught jayhawking.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. J. McARTHUR,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
