CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE-
And the committee affismed the decision of the Chair.
So the amendment was ruled out of order
Mr FiLLMORE, for the purpose, he said, of reserving the
question, as he was apprehensive that there was some mistake
about the matter, would move to reduce the appiopnavion for
Fort Washington fiom $33 000 to $5,000
Mr F sai 1 he had addiessed a letter to the Secietaiy of War,
for the purpose oí ascertaining how the fae sstoud
The amendment was agreed to
Mr. SNYDER inquired of the Chair whether, if he reduced
the amount from $5  ,000 (which was the pioposition that had
been rejected yesteiday) to $20,000 for repairs of the fort on Pea
Patch Island, the amendment would then be in order 1
TheCHAUiMAN said it would
Mr SNYDER thenoffeied his amendment, which renewed
briefly the discussion of yestprday in relation to the title to this

Mr BARNARD took an appeal ¡rom the deusion of the
Chair, which was argued for some time by Messrs HUNT,
BABCOCK W W IRWIN, FILLMORE and BARNARD,
when the question being put, tne decision of the Chair was sus
tamed
Mr UN DERWOOD said he had taken the pams to look into
the imountswhich had b^en appropuated foi some of these
fortifications dining the period he had had a seat m Congress,
andas an example he 1 il selected two woiks viz Foit Inde
pendence and Fo t W3 1 Jn in Boson harboi, and had found
that for Fort Waiten thevo ludbeen ippropnatcd in 1836 two
Tiundredthnu&and dollar-, m 1838. one hundied thousand dol .
lais, in lb3y louy thoLsand a liars in 1810, one hundred and J
fifty thousand dollars, in '841, ^5,000, and theie wabnow pio
poaed tobe added one hundted and five thousand dollars mak
ing in all *ik hundied and foi ty thousand dollars For Tort In-
dependence theie had been appropriated m 1836, one hundred
thousand dolíais, in 1833, fifty thousand dollars, in 1839, twenty
five thousand dollars, m 18j0, one hun Ired thoasand dollar^,
m 1841, thirty live thousand dollars, and in this bill, sixty five
thou=and dollar m ikms m all thice hundred and ceventy five
thousand dolíais So that for these two forts alore Congiens
had appropriated one million and fifteen thousand dolíais,
Mr U aa 1 Ihe had long known that thi^ was a seaboard and
salt watei G vemtiie it, and m refeteuce to woikg of ihis> kind it
was all right He didnof complain of the sur-isappropmted,
but wi lied to know whether the Committee of Ways aid
Means had institute f any investigation as to the manner m
which the money had been aponed These ium^ weie all
stated to have been "for repan V what the original cn^( of the
foits had bten he could not discover Po&^ihly all the inform 1*
ti^n idy in thed icuments, and it might be the fault ot his own
indolence th*: he had to make the present inquiry
Mi *-HErPERD took it for gianted that all the objects
named in the hill weie of importance, though not of equal im
poi tance, to the detence and protection of th*  rountiy And if
we had now an overflowing Tieasury as m 1833, he should offe*
no opposition to the bill, butas"Uch was not the case, he wished
to put an inquiry or two to the honoiable chanmau of the com
rnittee who had repoited the bill

of the country   If gentlemen had no confidence m the officers of
the Government, whose duty it was to be conversant with «uch
matters, they had better adjourn the House, and go and exa-
mine foi themselves The officers of the Engineer Department
had asked for thesesums, and had staled that ihey were needed,
and could be applied in the rapid iepair of the public defences
Did gentlemen ask for more'*
Mr RENCIIER said he had been one of diose members of
the Committee of Ways and means who doubted the expediency
of appropriating any moie foi these works at piesent, believing
that the unexpended appiopnations of foimer yeais would be
sufficient.   The appiopnations foi fortifications averaged $762,
000 a year Mr R s(ated the balance of unexpended appio
pnations to be $784,000, and added it to what was in the bill, ar
gumg that the amount was larger than could be properly ex-
pended this summer He went on the assumption that theap
propnations for 1842 would be made faeiore midsummer He
should be j 11 favor of btiiking out the whole of the appropria-
tions in the bill which were to be applied to fortifications. He
o' jectr d to tne general policy of leaving large sums appiopna-
ted an 1 not applied, and which the Piesident had the power of
translei ring atpleasure
Mi MALLORY defended the b II denying that there was
any want of system in the appropriations lor the fortifications
They had all been classified by an able board of engineeis, and
the present bill waschieilv to tun her putoof those work3 as had
beta placed by that board in the first class, as being of the most
uigent impottance He leplied to the aigumentoiMr Wise
on afjtmerday who had con&ideied appiopnating for fons as
incoiij stent w.th a due support of the navy Mr V denied
tliat ioe navy, oi floating battenes either were a substitute for
1   nifications They did not interfere with each other, but co-
operated m the general purpose of defence, and wre equilly
neeessary for that end He made some remarks in leply to Mr
Kpnchbr, and relentd to documents to ¡show that, so far from
implicitly relying oithe estimates of the Üepaitment, and giv-
ing whatevei they chose to ask foi, Congress had lefiued and
had cut down then estimates in the most niggardly manner,
and hence the existing state of our woiksoldelence
Mi M explained the waste as well bs delay which were ne-
cessarily produced by inadequate af propnations Ihey leff a
gap in the year, often during the very season when most work
could be done, and left the officers t barged with the superin-
tendence in a state of suspense and perplexity, not knowing
what they were to calculate upon Whence came all this op-
position to the present bill? From the "old North State," a Sta e
which was safe, hy nature, fiom the access of a maruime fc ©
Was it generous in gentlemen so ¡situated to refuse defence to
those who weie entuety exposed, and withoutany defence? As
to the gentleman fiom Kentucky [Mi Ur*DERWOOn ] ail the
Hon e could witness that he had been peiieetly ubul on the
