in the presentation of bills.

RECONSTRUCTION.
Mr. VOORHEES offered the following res- "
olutions, on which he demanded the previous
question:
Resolved, That tho message of the President of the
United States, delivered at the opening of the present
Congress, is regarded by this body as an able, judi-
cious, and patriotic state paper.
Resolved, That tb e principles therein advocated for
the restoration of the Union are the safest and most'
practicable that can now be applied to our disordered
domestic affairs.
Iiesolved, That no State or number of States! con-"
federated together can in any manner sunder their
connection with tho Federal Union, except by a total
subversion of our present system of governmentrand
that the President in enunciating this doctrine in his"
late message has but given expression to the senti-
ments of all those who deny the right or power of a
State to secede.
Resolveel, That the President is entitled to the:
thanks of Congress and the country for his faithful,
wise, and successful efforts to restore civil govern-
ment, law, and order to those States whose citizens
were lately in insurrection against tho Federal
authority; and we hereby pledge ourselves to aid,
assist, and uphold him in the policy which he has
adopted to give harmony, peace, and union to the
country.
Mr. STEVENS. I suggest to the gentleman
that he had better-not insist upon having the
House act upon these resolutions now. There
arc so few members here that I suppose that
we should not bo able to act to-day on any-
thing if it comes to a test. The gentleman can
allow the resolutions to be referred to the joint
committee on reconstruction.
Mr. VOORHEES. T will state to the gen-
tleman that my only fear in pressing the matter
is that we may develop the fact that there is not
a quorum present; and I do not desire to inter-
fere with any business which the House may
desire to transact.
Mr. STEVENS. That is what I fear myself.
The SPEAKER. The Chair has counted
the members present, and there are- only about
eightyâ€”less than a quorum. There may pos-
sibly be other members in the outer rooms.
There might perhaps be a quorum, if all the
members in the Capitol were in the House.
Mr. STEVENS. There may be some other
members in different parts of the Capitol; but
if the gentleman calls for the yeas and nays, we
will find ourselves without a quorum. Let the
gentleman postpone its consideration until after
the holidays.
Mr. VOORHEES. I will do so. I do not
want to interfere with the business of the House,
and on the statement that there is no quorum
present I will let it go over until after the holi-
days. I would of course like to have an expres-
sion on it now.
Mr. SPALDING. I move that the House:
resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union.
Mr. JENCKES. I move that the House do
now adjourn.
Mr. VOORHEES. I have not yielded the
floor. I move that the further consideration of
the resolutions be postponed until the 9th of
January next.
Tho motion was agreed to.
Mr. VOORHEES moved to reconsider tho
vote by which tho resolutions were postponed;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid upon the mble.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS. I ask the gentleman from
Ohio to withdraw his motion to go into Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
so that we may call committees for reports.
There may be bills which perhaps ought to be
printed and put upon our tables when we meet
after the holidays.
Mr. SPALDING. I withdraw thetnotioii
