HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., July 31, 1865.

Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington:

COLONEL: By authority given to me personally, the headquarters of this department were retained in Saint Louis, but no order having been made establishing them here, I have the honor to request that an order to that effect be issued by proper authority. For Leavenworth is out of place as the headquarters of a department which includes Iowa, Missouri, Minnesota, and the region of country lying west of the latter State. Saint Louis is the center of all this region; communications with it are more direct and convenient, and all the depots of supply and facilities of communication are here. It is altogether the most convenient and proper place for the headquarters of this department. I explained all this fully to the General-in-Chief in Washington, and on his authority retained the headquarters here. The records of this department, of the Western Department, and of the old Department of the West, for the last forty years are here and cannot be removed without greatly embarrassing the transaction of business. These records are delay referred to in thousands of cases occurring and which have occurred in Missouri, and they contain all the papers concerning organization of regiments, discharges, &amp;c., which have served in the West since the beginning of the war. I trust the necessary order established the headquarters here will soon be issued.

I am, colonel, respectfully, Your obedient servant,

JOHN POPE,

Major-General, Commanding.
