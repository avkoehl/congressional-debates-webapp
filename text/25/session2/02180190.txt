Mr. B1JCHAN VN nddioss.nl ihe Senate as lol-
lows
Mi Piumdcm J rise to present to the Senate a
rewliition ol the Legislature of Pennsylvania,
whicn I received trom Governor Hitner on yester-
da\ alternoon, ltnutsting their Repicsentatives
in Congress, and niatructing tlieir Senators, " to
Mite ami use their influence tor a postponement,
until the niAt .espión of Congress, ot the aclintio-
dttced by im' Hon Snas Wricihi, of New York,
commonly tailed Ihe Sub-Trcasmy bill, oi any
other at t 01 ac ts of a i-mnlai charactei , and that
they vole at this *es>sion lor no act ol a similar na-
ture " The Legislature also, by Ihe same resolu-
tion, deelaied lhat they "have lull confidence m
Mnut . Van BimF\', and in the wisdom andmtelli-
gence of their Dem cratic Senators and Keprescn-
la ti ves in Congress," and iuriher instruct and ic-
qtiest their Senators and Representatives " to vote
for such a mode ot receiving, keeping, and disburs-
ing the public monejts, a¡> will separate, as lar as
practicable, Ihe banks from the Government "
I feel confident that the Sen ue will pardon me,
considering the peculiar position in which I am
placed, ior mahmg a few remarks in explanation
ot the course which 1 intend to pursue under tins,
resolution. It in well known, both to the Señale
and to the country, that at the last session of Con-
giess, I presented rny views in detail in favoi ol a
sepatationof iheTieasury Irom all banks, as- fiscal
agents ol the Government My opinion upon this
subjoc i remains, unchanged na), il h<i¡>been con-
firmed by subsequent events and subsequent reflec-
tion After a careful examination of the bill re-
poned by ihe Senator (rom New York, as it has
been since amended, I think, in the mam, it i? \vell
calculated to carry into pi active this principle oí
separation Whilst it >ncie<ws executive palton-
age to a very small eUeti', and no more thin is ab-
solutely necessary to cai ry into effect its, principles,
it confers no power whatever upon the Secietaiy r 1
the Treasury over the public money, except that
which he has exercised ever since the origin of the
present Government and a provision of the bill,
which has never existed heretofore, renders it im-
possible that the ordinary Treasury drafts which
are delivered to the public creditors should ever be
used as currency.   With some furtheramendmente,
which I need not now specify, but which I had in-
tended to move, on a proper occasion, I should
have given a cheerful support to this bill. But I
am instructed, and it remains for rae to decide what
coarse I ought to pursue, under this change of cir-
cumstances.
Ever since I was capable of forming an opinion
upon this subject, I have believed that the Legisla-
tures of the several States had a right to instruct
their Senators. In my opinion, this right results
from the very nature of our Constitution, which is
a Federal compact between distinct and sovereign
States. It has ever been considered, with but {ew
exceptions, n fundamental article m the political
creed of that parly to which I am proud to belong.
I have, m public and in private, in the face of the
Senate and before the country, often expressed this
opinion, and I shall never pieach one doctrine of
political faith, and practice another. I shall never
shrink from what I conceive to be my duty, be-
cause, m performing it, I may apply the torture to
myself.
1 know that some of my most valued friends in
Pennsylvania, who hold the right of instruction to
be sawed, are of opinion, that, under the peculiar
circumstances of this case, I ought to disobey these
instructions. But do they not peiceive that if the
Senatoi can look behind his instructions, the right
is at once abandoned? Under the pretext, or, if
y ou please, under the honest belief, that they do
not speak the voice of the people, or that they
have bsen corruptly or impioperly obtained, a
Senator could always justify himself to himself
for disobedience. 1 shall, thetefore, not disobey my
instructions My only alternative, then, is either
to obey oi to resign.
Upon questions of mere expediency, m which no
constitutional principles are involved, it ought to
be a ve iy strong case to induce the Senator to
abandon his post If every difference of opinion
between the Senator and his Legislatuie should
produce tins effect, the right of instruction itself
would soon grow into disrepute, and the Senatorial
tenn oí six yeais, as fixed by the Constitution,
would terminate whenever such a conflict of opi-
nion should arise.
1 can conceive of extreme ca*>es m which, on
question? ot mere expediency, an honorable man
might feel lumsell disgraced iij even becoming the
agent to give the vote of his State. No person, of
any party with whom I have conversed, considers
the present to be such a case; and I am confirmed
in my own opinion upon this subject by the exam-
ple of the Senator from Tennessee, (Mr. Gtbundv.)
I shall, therefore, obey my instructions ' inestly
and in good faith; and, like him, on every question
of proposed amendments, shall give such a vote as
a fair and honorable opponent oí the bill ought, m
my judgment, to give
It is scarcely necessary to add that, as I am not
instructed to suppoit the substitute for the bill, of-
fered by the Senator from Virginia, (Mr. Rives,) 1
shall exercise my own opinion, and vote against its
adoption.
I shall take leave to expiess my high gratifica-
tion at one clause contained in the resolution of in-
struction. The Legi&lature of Pennsylvania have
shown to the world that they justly appreciate the
merits of the statesman whom the people of the
United States have placed at the head of the Go-
vernment, by declaring " their full confidence m
Marun Van Buhln." Such a well deserved tri-
bute io superior merit might be considered as the
incense of flaiteiy, had it been offered by his politi-
cal fuends. The reverse is the case upen the pre-
sent occasion The resolution containing this ex-
pression of confidence, on its final passage, re-
ceived the vole of every Opposition member of the
House of Representative's, and, lam informed, oí
the Senate, whether Whig or Anümason, and was
approved by Joseph Ritner, Governor. Thus, even
his very enemies are made to praise him. I ought
to say that I hav e not yet received any statement of
the votes of the individual Senators
A compliment equally well deserved is paid by
the resolution to the democratic portion of the Re-
presentatives of the State in Congress I heartily
commend the Legislature for expressing full confi-
dence in their wisdom and intelligence.   A more
