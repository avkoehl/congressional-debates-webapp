Have two good regiments ready to embark in cars that General John E. Smith will send for you, to join an expedition to go up to Resaca to attack Wheeler, who is damaging our road. Let the balance of the garrison be confined to one or two redoubts, and on the exhibition on the part of the people of any hostility, burn the town down.

General VANDEVER, Rome:

Have your dispatch. I suppose Clanton is still at Blue Mountain. I am willing he should stay there. I hear that Wheeler failed to surprise Dalton, an has gone up into East Tennessee. He cannot do much harm there. Let your cavalry pick up as many horses and mules as possible, also recruits, and be most active. I expect soon to make a move that will bring things to a crisis.
