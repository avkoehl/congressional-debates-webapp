HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Nashville, Tenn., November 7, 1864.

Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose for the information of the major-general commanding copy of a telegram* just received from Major Chambliss, special inspector of cavalry at Louisville, and to request that instructions be sent to General Burbridge requiring him to dismount the negro regiments, alluded to in the telegram, and to have the horses turned over to the proper officers of the Cavalry Bureau for issue to troops in the field. I would also suggest that General Burbridge be informed he has no control or command over the horses and cavalry sent into Kentucky for remount, and that he will therefore exercise no authority over them.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION CAVALRY,Bough's Mills, November 7, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

We hold the line of Shoal Creek at Bough's Mills taken yesterday. I have one brigade here and move one brigade down the creek to fill up the gap between my DIVISION and General Croxton, and to hold the main Lexington and Florence road. I find the enemy strong at the fords below me. We are now feeling the enemy's pickets. My headquarters will be at Taylor's Springs to-night, which will be about five miles southeast of this point, that position being more central.
