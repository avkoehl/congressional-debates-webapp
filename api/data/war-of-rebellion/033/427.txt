Brigadier-General FISK, Pilot Knob:

General Davidson has long since abandoned his line of communication with Cape Girardeau. Dispose of your troops without reference to that line. Have all stores and other property intended for General Davidson's command sent back to Cape Girardeau.

Major-General.

Brigadier-General GUITAR, Macon City:

The rebels are making efforts to concentrate in Saline, La Fayette, and Jackson Counties. I am informed that some have crossed from the north side of the river. Will it be possible for you in case of emergency, to send some of your force across the river?

Major-General.

General FISK:

If it is true that General Davidson is at Helena, can I not withdraw my force from Chalk Bluff? They are getting sick fast. The point is of no strategical importance, and a force so isolated and compelled to forage at immense distance is constantly in danger of being cut up; besides, the force itself may be hemmed in, and, being so far from supplies, and no forage, could not out long. The concentration of guerrillas, and the daring raids between here and there, fill me with anxiety. I fear for them unless speedily re-enforced or withdrawn. I suggest that you allow me to move them up in the rear of Reves' force; send Major Montgomery out on this side, let me approach from this quarter and you via northwest, and rid the country of these murders. One thing or the other should be done at once. These may be enveloped and cut off from forage at any day. Kitchen is said to be between Davidson and us, with 500 men and for pieces; Reves northeast, with 300 men.

General FISK:

Dispatch just received from Lieutenant-Colonel Hiller. He says:

Have just arrived here (Bloomfield) from the bluffs to see about supplies. The country is fast filing up with guerrillas; have had four brushes with them. Killed the notorious Lieutenant Chamber, of Kennett, and three or four others. Recaptured the train taken from Merrill's Horse. Sergeant Ferguson, Second Missouri State Militia, dangerously wounded and 1 private. We need more force. Forage scarce.

HILLER.

Kitchen is concentrating, and I fear disaster from difficulty of getting forage; they harass our small parties and can starve them out. The guerrillas are on our right, rear, and all around, and formidable to so small a force remote from forage. I suggest that they be strengthened or withdrawn. The post can be of no value now if Major Joslyn is re
