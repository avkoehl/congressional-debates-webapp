CITY POINT, July 4, 1864 - 4 p. m.

(Received 5th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

A deserter who came in this morning reports that Ewell's corps has not returned here, but is off in the Valley with the intention of going into Maryland and Washington City. They now have the report that he already has Arlington Heights and expects to take the city soon. Of course the soldiers know nothing about this force further than it is away from here and north somewhere. Under the circumstances I think it advisable to hold all of the forces you can about Washington, Baltimore, Cumberland, and Harper's Ferry, ready to concentrate against any advance of the enemy. Except from the dispatches forwarded from Washington in the last two days I have learned nothing which indicated an intention on part of the rebels to attempt any northern movement. If General Hunter is in striking distance there ought to be veteran force enough to meet anything the enemy have, and if once put to flight he ought to be followed as long as possible. This report of Ewell's corps being north is only the report of a deserter, and we have similar authority for it being here and on the right of Lee's army. We know, however, that it does not occupy this position.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
