FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 11, 1864.

General BLUNT:

Don't know Sanborn's force. Price left Boonville yesterday morning marching on Lexington with 15,000 cavalry. We are just leaving for Olathe, headquarters in the field.

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

PAOLA, October 11, 1864.

Colonel C. R. JENNISON,

Mound City:

What number of militia have reported at Mound City? Are they coming in promptly from the interior? Use every effort to concentrate them as rapidly as possibly.

PAOLA, October 11, 1864.

Colonel C. R. JENNISON,

Fort Scott:

If you have not already done so, send scouts by way of Papinsville north of the Osage. On yesterday General Rosecrans reported that Price had left Jefferson City and was moving toward Sedalia. Send your scouts well north in that direction and report to me promptly all information you receive relative to movements of the enemy.

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT SCOTT, October 11, 1864.

Major-General BLUNT:

Three companies in town are armed and ready for duty; four companies are reported to me from the country; will be in to-morrow and armed. I have also near 100 negroes under drill, but not yet armed. There is also a company of Government employees.

CHAS. W. BLAIR,

Colonel, Commanding.

MOUND CITY, October 11, 1864.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR:

Send a scout of twenty-five men down to Osage, where Price would naturally cross going south, and report result to me by telegraph; then let them scout north. They must be cautious and careful, because my scouts are out in the direction of Papinsville.

C. R. JENNISON,

Colonel.

MOUND CITY, October 11, 1864.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR:

From present indications it is very probable that Price will move in the direction of Fort Scott for the purpose of getting from that place a
