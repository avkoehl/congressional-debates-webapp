THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

derived. That was the only manner in which the
question could be raised here; it was a matter of
necessity. I could not petition the Senate for a
seat as a member upon this floor. The Senate
have no right to give any seat. If I come here,
I must do so upon the strength of my credentialsâ€”
the authority of my State. Those credentials are
already on file. They are, on the face of them,
in force. There is nothing at this moment on the
records of the Senate which would terminate my
duties here; there is nothing on record which would
authorize the President or the Secretary to erase
my name from the roll. So far as the Senate are
officially advised, there is and can be no question
upon the subject. But facts are understood to have
transpired, of which the Senate has as yet no of-
ficial notice, which may affect my right to a seat
here.
Under these circumstances, it must be apparent
to every one, that the only mode of bringing the
question before the Senate, was to appear here as
a member of the body, leaving it to my friends, or
my enemies, if I have any, [Several Senators:
Wot one.] to raise the question. Under these cir-
cumstances, I believe those friends will do me the
justice to say that when I came here, I came with
the question on my tongue, consulting with mem-
bers in what manner it would be most appropriate
to bring it before the Senate. Sir, I trust I may
not be regarded as having presented myself here
from mere personal considerations, nor be looked
upon in the light of a squatter upon this floor.
Mr. SEWARD. It is proper that I should say,
by way of confirmation of the remarks of the hon-
orable Senator, that at the earliest day, and even
before his arrival in this city, his friends were ad-
vised that they were desired to consider as to the
proper manner in which the question should be
brought up here; and what has been done has been
done in concurrence with the delicate wishes ex-
pressed by the honorable gentleman himself.
The resolution was agreed to.
PETITIONS, ETC.
Mr. BRODHEAD presented the petition of
Gideon Hotchkiss, praying the extension of a pat-
ent for improvements in reacting water-wheels and
their appendages; which, with the papers on file
relating to the same case, was referred to the Com-
mittee on Patents and the Patent Office.

Mr. EVERETT. I have been requested to
present the petition of Peter Amey, who was on
board the United States frigate Essex, in the year
1814, at the time of the memorable action in which
that vessel was engaged. On that occasion he
received a severe wound. He now asks for a
pension. I move that the petition and accompany-
ing papers be referred to the Committee on Pen-
sions.
Mr. CASS presented the petition of Laurence
Taliaferro, praying a pension on account of dis-
ease contracted in the military service of the Uni-
ted States during the last war with Great Britain.

ments made by him in the construction of vessels
designed for the Navy may be tried in the con-
struction of one of the vessels about to be built;
which was referred to the Committee on Naval

CHEAP OCEAN POSTAGE.
Mr, SUMNER. Mr. President, I hold in my
hand a memorial from citizens of Boston, assem-
bled in Faneuil Hall, in which they pray that the
rate of ocean postage may be reduced to the uni-
form charge of two cents, or one English penny,
for single transit service for letters under half an
ounce in weight. The meeting at which the me-
morial was adopted was presided over by the
Mayor of the city, assisted by vice presidents,
men the most eminent in literature and business
in that community. It was addressed also by
eminent gentlemen of different parties. The me-
morial is brief, and singularly well drawn. I would,
therefore, while moving its reference to the Com-
mittee on the Post Office and Post Roads, ask
the unanimous consent of the Senate that it be
printed. I believe the chairman of the Committee
on Printing agrees with me that it is expedient
that it should lie printed.
The memorial was referred to the Committee on
the Post Office and Post Roads, and ordered to be
printed.
