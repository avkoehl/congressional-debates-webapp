Enemy evacuated Battery Anderson and re-embarked. General Bragg desires you to detain all troops arriving in Wilmington till further orders, holding them in hand and keeping steam-boats constantly ready. Look out well toward Masonborough; we are sending a squadron of cavalry there.

Lieutenant-General HOLMES:

I am just from Fort Fisher. The bombardment was terrific, but the defense was as gallant. The damage was slight, except to buildings not necessary for defense. The troops behaved well and are in fine spirits. The enemy are making no movements. All immediate danger is passed, and you may suspend the transfer of stores and property.
