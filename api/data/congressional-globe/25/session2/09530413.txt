APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25rn Coi*g--"2nd Sess.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Toucey.
H. of Reps.
the knowledge of our weakness, and so universal
is the belief there that a combined Indian attack
will ere long be made upon our settlements, that
if adequate protection is not immediately afforded,
the country will either be abandoned, or such steps
will be taken for the purpose of fortifying the
country and placing it in a sta'e of defence, as ihey
may themselves be capable of, if they find that they
have been abandoned to their fate by the National
Government Our peop'e are brave, sir, and
would make a determined stand if they could be
embodied, but, separated as they aie, and scattered
over so wide a surface, an In han force of many
thousand warrior , such as they are now capable
of collecting instantly together, armed as they have
been by our Government, and well supplied with
ammunition, might deluge our country with blood,
and spread desolation over the whole border settle-
ments, before a sufficient force could be emoodied
to stay the work of death.
The excitement which now pie vails upon the
frontier, from the belief that the powerful Indian
tribes are rife for war, makes it the imperious duty
of the Government to afford prompt and adequate
protection I trust, sir, I have satisfied the Senatp
(hat the measure now proposed will add materially
to the defence ot the country, and would form a
■solid barrier against the incursions of a merciless
and exterminating savage fee
I feel it to be my duty to state to the Senate and
to the country, that the inhabitants of Missouri and
Arkansas are at this moment in a most critical
situation The lives, of all sexes and conditions
are in jeopardy. They are now looking with in-
tense anxiety to the action of Congress Nothing
has yet been done Will you, after hav ig forced
upon them such terrible neighbors, refuse them
that protection which humanity demands? I am
satisfied it will not be refused By the proposed
measure, the services of an efficient and considera-
ble force will be secured for five years, at the rate
of $200 for each soldier It is true, they may not
be required, even during the whole of that period, to
go to the field of battle, but they will be at all times
in the face of danger, and fully prepared for action
I feel the utmost confidence that a body of troops
thus collected together, may be certainly relied
upon, and that they will bravely and nobly defend
the hmd they have upon such terms chosen as their
homes If the country proposed to be thus occu-
pied, was an uninhabited wilderness, then indeed,
perhaps, some might fear that such a measure
might cause it to be filled up with a dangerous and
lawless population Settled, however, as this coun-
try already is, by an honorable, high-minded, and
virtuous people, amongst whom desperate and bad
men would not be permitted to remain, the vacant
lands must necessarily be occupied by such a de-
scription of people as will pro lote the prosperity,
as well a  add to the defence, of the country
In an economical point of view, ho defence
could be cheaper than that which is proposed by
the bill under consideration It is true, it would
not do to be alone relied upon, but if a dense settle-
ment is presented to the Indians all along the line,
trained to the use of arms, and so organized as to
be capable of taking the field m considerable force
at the shortest notice, such would be their con-
sciousness of our military strength, and our ability
to defend ourselves, as must necessarily force them
to remain at peace, or at least to hesitate long be-
fore they would consent to make war upon such a
settlement Powerful, however, as are the Indian
tribes immediately upon our border, and relieved,
as they now are, from all apprehensions of attack
from the Indians of the prairies, and since the
policy has been adopted of making peace between
the wild Indians and those who are somewhat
civilized, the necessity for maintaining a sufficient
number of regular troops, not only to preserve
peace amongst the Indians themselves, but also to
deter them from all attempts towards uniting toge-
ther, and making common cause against the fron-
tier States, is most strikingly manifested. Indeed,
sir, it is the duty of this Government to place the
frontier in the most perfect state of defence Ex-
perience has proved to us that whenever the In-
dians become desperate, even the fear of extermi-
nation will not prevent them from madly rushing
upon death, and forcing upon us the necessity of
destroying them, as the only mode by which they
can be prevented from perpetrating the most despe-
rate deeds of blood. It is also true, that no matter
how war may come upon us, the certain conse-
quence always will be, that then at least we must
expect an Indian war to break out. We can-
not hope to escape from war altogether, and there-
fore, a large force will be constantly required to
keep the Indians in check. If a sufficient force
could have been sent to Florida at the time the In-
dians began first to manifest a hostile spirit, what
a vast expenditure of blood and treasure would
have been saved to the nation' So long as there
are indications of hostility manifested by the In-
dians, or A remote prospect of a foreign war exists,
the only means of preserving peace will be to place
our exposed frontier in such a state of defence, as
will be calculated to give ample protection to the
people.
Some objection may be made to the quantity of
land proposed to be set apart for military purposes
by this bill. But, sir, that portion of it now unoc-
cupied, and capable of yielding a support, is not
considerable The quantity of land proposed to
be set apart is only two townships m depth, not
wider than is necessary to create a barrier over
which an invader cannot pass The belt com-
mences on Red river, and, as the greater portion
of the country between Red river and the Arkan-
sas is exceedingly broken and sterile, only a small
poition in that section of the State, withm the pro-
posed limits, will be settled upon on the terms of-
fered. That section between the Arkansas river
and the Missouri line, i« capable of supporting a
dense population, and such fearless and enterpris-
ing men as will risk their lives, and those of their
families, there at this time, and who desire to live
by field labor, may procure homes in between those
limits, if disposed to avail themselves of the terms
offered. But as already much of this land has
been purchased from the United States, the re-
mainder will not be sufficient to afford settlements
for a larger number of persons than the defence
of the country demands. The same remark ap-
plies, I presume, to the country between the line
of the Stale of Missouri and the Missouri river.
This is the extent to which the bounty settlement is
contemplated to extend. That portion of the State
of Missouri bordering on the Missouri river is con-
sidered not to be in danger, or so much exposed to
Indian aggression.
The policy of all other Governments has been
to grant lands with a view to encourage their set-
tlement and cultivation. Our country having set-
tled so rapidly, many of our statesmen have become
opposed to the wide-spread extension of our popu-
lation. Their policy is to adopt measures to en-
rich the nation from the sales of the public lands
No measure, therefore, having for its object only
he settlement of the country, could hope to find
avor at this time with Congress But as the pre-
ent measure proposes the grant of lands already
culled over, and in consideration for perils and ser-
vices to be rendered upon a national object of the
first magnitude and importance, and in the de-
fence of a portion of the country, to protect which
the Government has, by its own action, imposed
upon itself an obligation of the highest and most
binding character, and to neglect which would be a
breach of faith, which wou'd not only be disgrace-
fal, but would also involve her in a most bloody
and exterminating war—it does seem to me that
the bill before us cannot fail to find favor in the
breasts of Senators
The proposed measure will create a considera-
ble force, answeung nearly every purpose of a cor-
responding amount of regular troops, and without
subjecting the Government to any of the expenses,
or giving rise to any of the apprehensions which
standing armies are calculated to produce.
I trust the Senate is satisfied that there is an ur-
gent necessity for a large increase of force upon
the southwestern frontier. It is not my purpose to
urge this or any other measure, by an attempt to
createunnecessary alarm It is known to all that a
vast number of Indians have been congregated
upon the frontier. It is also known that they have
been instructed in the use of the rifle, and that we
have put the very best description of that weapon
into their hands It is known that great dissatisfac-
tion and loud complaints have been poured out
against the Government by the inhabitants of the
frontier, for having manifested so little concern, as
they think, for the perilous situation in whioh they
have been placed by the|pohcy of the Government.
They tell their representatives not to cease their
efforts until they succeed m rousing every depart-
ment of the Government to a proper sense of the
danger to which they are exposed. They say it
will not do to compare their situation with that of
the early settlers of Kentucky and Tennessee.
Those settlers had to contend with (comparatively
speaking) but a handful of Indian warriors, and
those, too, not armed with the deadly rifle. They,
too, went prepared to fight for the country they set-
tled in They spilt their blood lively, and held the
land at an immense sacrifice of life, and by suffer-
ings, at the n ention of which all our sympathies
are awakened This Government has no right to
place the citizens of Arkansas and Missouri m a
similar ¡situation The people of those States have
done no act which should involve them in an In-
dian war, and particularly such a one as may now
be waged against them It is against the whole
people of the United States that the Indians are dis-
posed to make war, and it is, therefore, the duty of
the Government to see that our citizens are not left
to suffer alone I trust, sir, that every measure of
defence will be promptly taken by the Government,
and I hope that the measure proposed by the bill
under consideration may be speedily adopted.
INDEPENDENT TREASURY.
SPEECH OF MR. TOUCEY,
Of Coüinecticüi,
In the House of Representatives, June 23, 1838—In
Committee ot the Whole  on the state of the
Union, on the bill tor the estabhshmeat ol an
Independent Treasury
Mr TOUCEY rose and said-
I regret, sir, that this measure has not been
brought into discussien in this House at an ear-
lier period of the session The bill from the
Senate on the same subject was laid upon the
table, without discussion, by a silent vote; and this
great measure, the-dehverance of ihe Government
of the American people from abject and dan-
gerous dependence upon the banks, and the esta-
blishment of an Independent Treasury in pursu-
ance of the plain principles of the Constitution—a
measure, fraught with immense interest to the coun-
try, and destined to influence permanently, as well
as deeply, the welfare of this great nation—has not,
until this late period, been made the subject of de-
bate and deliberation in the House of Representa-
uves. I approach it now under a strong sense of
my responsibility to a most enlightened constitu-
ency, and to the American people, and I shall en-
deavor to discharge my duty under the guidance of
truth and reason, and in entire forgetfulness of
every consideration not connected with the best in-
terests of the country.
This measure has already taken effect, practi-
cally, by force of existing laws, and was brought
about by the suspension of specie payments on the
part of the banks. It is no longer a question
whether the separation shall take place, but whether
a new «toom shall be formed with them, after they
have sepaiated themselves from the Government,
have entirely failed to perform their engagements
in the most essential particulars, have, in the midst
of a long and prosperous peace, inflicted upon the
country a multitude of depreciated currencies, and
when the whole system has fallen prostrate under
the weight of its own excesses I am against a re-
union, and I propose to state the reasons for my
opinion.
We are still m the midst of one of the greatest
calamities which can befall a people, because
it reaches every individual in the country. No
one so humble, no one so exalted, as not to taste
its bitter fruits. In the downward progress to it,
and m the convulsive stiuggle to return and escape
from, it, the value of eveiy man's property is un-
