at home, and she does not abate her demands
for national favor, though the market prices
of her productions place them beyond pres-
ent need, high above the reach of "protec-
tion," unless we accept the standard of Mr.
.Greeley, and put pig iron at $100 per ton, and
other articles in proportion. And while her
demands for continued "protection" are
pressed, she clamors for relief from national
taxation as if she were hardened beyond endur-
ance. Second among the States in population
and wealth, first in benefits from the nation,
she is fourth on the tax-roll, falling below
New York, Ohio, and Illinois in the payment
of internal taxes.
Who, hearing the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania [Mr. Kelley] denouncing special na-
tional taxes, would suppose that Pennsylvania
could levy such impositions upon her own
people for her own support? Yet if you con-
sult her official archives you will find in the
Pennsylvania Legislative Documents 1871, page
136, that in 1870 she collected by tax on corpor-
ation stocks, $1,241,278 24; on net incomes,
$396,193 92; on gross receipts, $392,809 79 ;
pn tonnage, $401,493 ; commutation of tonnage
tax, $360,000; on licenses over $788,770 45;
on coal, $251,193 22; while her taxes on land
were nothing, and on personal property but
$702,165 04, levied on $171,000,000 of the
$3,800,000,000 of her wealth.
And if you consult the report of the auditor
general for the year ending November 30,
1871, you will find that she collected for that
year taxes as follows:
Tax on corporation stocks $1,269,550 53
Tax on net earnings or income  339,445 05
Tax on gross receipts  437,804 49
Tax on tonnage    471,749 34

Tax on coal  163,760 02
Tax on tavern licenses  329,474 09
Tax on retailers' licenses  445,956 17
The only property tax was that on per-
sonal property  499,862 24
The various taxes on corporations are mainly
on companies engaged in mining, manufac-
turing, and transporting, and fall at last on
production of coal aud iron, while the ton-
nage tax is a burden on the transportation of
these and other products of that and other
States. To see where these taxes rest let us
turn to the detailed statement of the Auditor
General for 1871. Among items of "tax" on
corporation stocks" we find such as these:

Yet, while Pennsylvania levies these taxes
on coal and iron, from the mine to the mar-
ket, even while she is collecting a direct tax
on coal, a necessary element of the produc-
tion of iron, she appears before us as a mena-
cing mendicant, begging, demanding protec-
tion for these articles, which she burdens with
extraordinary exactions. And we, yielding to
her importunities, pour bounties into her lap
from the pockets of the people of the whole
Union, who consume her surplus products,
and she gathers our contributions into her
own treasury, and in the name of the "labor"
she taxes, and the "American industry" she
tolls, asks us for more, more 1 In the volume

These, with other special taxes, such as for
acts of incorporation and enrollment of laws,
amounted in those four years to over thirteen
million dollars. Add estimates for 1872 and
we have a total in five years of over sixteen
million dollars, chiefly from those industries
which we protect. It is a significant fact that
the greater part of these taxes on incomes,
(gross and net,) on corporation stocks and on
coal, were recently enacted. Some of them
were conceived under the present exorbitant
tariff, and are among its natural results; for
well do the politicians of Pennsylvania know
that with existing duties their " protected in-
dustries" are best able to bear taxation; but
is it not amazing that intelligent Represent-
atives from a State pursuing such an internal
policy, shifting the burdens of Government
from property to industry, taxing the produc-
tion and transportation of coal and iron in
manifold ways, should be able to stand in the
national Congress and ask, ay, demand, with
arrogance and threats, continued special na-
tional bounties for those interests and indus-
tries? Yet are the Representatives from Penn-
sylvania almost unanimous for the present tar-
ing And there is too much reason to believe
that the people of that State are accustomed
to throw off the burdens of taxation. Doubt-
less they understand and approve the double
system of national bounty and State exac-
tions on the products of their mines and
manufactories by which they make the people
of other States contribute to their industries
so liberally as to enable the producers to pay
tithings to the State and still make large profits.
What if Pennsylvania iron and coal do pay
millions annually to tho State, does not the
Union annually pay tens of millions to Penn-
sylvania iron and coal ?
The document already cited shows the valu-
ation of personal property for taxation in 1870.
The total is $171,686,918. The census return
of property in the State in the same year was
$3,808,340,112. Less than one twentieth
part of the property was taxed. The total
return of taxable property in Philadelphia
was $44,664,158, on which the tax collected
for State purposes in 1871 was $96,261 98.
Let her citizens say what proportion these
sums bear to the wealth of the city. But
why dwell on details? History shows that
from the beginning Pennsylvania, under the
lead of her chief city, has pursued the policy
of special local taxation. In January, 1704,
Philadelphia required Thomas Potts to pay
twenty-two shillings and sixpence to be
"admitted a freeman" of that city. This
great and prosperous State has been confirmed
in this double dealing policy of national boun-
ties and local exactions until she and ber chil-
dren seem proud of it. They have reached
that stage of political fanaticism which believes
" the end justifies the means."
Hence we see her standing between political
parties balancing chances, with her electoral
vote in her hand, offering it to either side
which will give or promise her the greatest
bounties, while parties truckle, and tremble
at her feet and offer bribes for her favor.
Such is the internal policy of the "protect-
ive" States—so inconsistent, that we are re-
minded of what is said by Mr. J. S. Moore,
in his "Notes," published in the report of the
chief of the United States Bureau of Statistics
for 1871. (See Appendix page, 108.)
"The origin of tariffs is neither very pure nor
honorable. It w.is tho invention of the feudal
lords, who in olden timos levied a toll on all arti-
cles that came to their territories, either for direct
consumption or for passage through them, which
was an ingenious substitute for the former more
summary moiio of confiscating the goods altogether,
and holding tho owners for ransom." * * *
* "The 'tariff' owes its name to the town of
Tariffa on the Barbary coast, where imposts on
goods passing were first exacted."
This internal policy certainly admits that the
States adopting and maintaining it consider
those industries which we reward by bounties, i
drawn indirectly but not less certainly from
the people engaged in other pursuits, fit and
proper subjects of State taxation, not only
equal to that laid on other interests and indus-
tries, but even more onerous.
pennsylvania and massachusetts.
This is confessed by solemn act of each State,
but especially by Pennsylvania and Massachu-
setts, yet these States plethoric with wealth
derived from protection, one the political ar- -
biter and the other the intellectual leader of
the Onion, combine in conventions, in con-
gressional committee and on the floors of both
Houses to prevent reduction and equalization
of taxes on the plea of protection to American
industry, while one tax.es the products and the
other tolls the earnings of labor.
It is said in the East that when soothsayers
