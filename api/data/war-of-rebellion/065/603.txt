Major General J. F. GILMER,

Savannah, Ga.:

Colquitt's brigade has been ordered to proceed from Rantowles to Savannah as soon as transportation can be supplied. Have rations for it ready; also transportation to convey it to Lake City, or other point in Middle Florida, to report to General Finegan if needed. You will be notified when to expect it.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, February 13, 1864-3.30 p. m.

General S. COOPER:

If enemy from Vicksburg burns bridges in his rear, he must be going toward Pascagoula, to open communication with Gulf and New Orleans, for work on Mobile. Cannot he be anticipated and decoyed into starvation of surrender? I believe that the expedition from Jacksonville, Fla., was intended for Tallahassee, or Saint Mark's, to open their communication with Gulf and New Orleans.

Flag-Officer J. R. TUCKER,

Commanding C. S. Naval Forces Afloat, Charleston Harbor:

SIR: In reply to your letter of yesterday, I hasten to say that I have no special service in the Stono to suggest beyond the destruction of the Pawnee of Marblehead, but the chances for which, it would appear, are substantially destroyed by the want of a pilot acquainted with the channel.

It was not in Schooner Creek that I had desired the David to attempt operations, but against the enemy's barges at high tide between the mouth of that creek and Cumming's Point.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
