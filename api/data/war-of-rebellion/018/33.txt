March 30, 1862.

Major-General FREMONT, Wheeling:

Your request for authority to draw troops from the Governors of States has been submitted to the President and will be answered to-morrow. That method of obtaining re-enforcements is subject to grave objections, and will not be accorded if the force can be furnished from the troops now in the field, unless to a limited and specific extent. What number of troops do you desire in addition to your present force and from what States can you procure them?

Secretary of War.

WHEELING, VA., March 30-10 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I can do good work if you will let me have immediately 20,000 men. I suppose some force may be had from Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan-in Ohio, one fine infantry regiment, two batteries of artillery; in Wisconsin, Barstow's cavalry regiment, at Racine. There was a few weeks since a battery (Coldwater Artillery) in Michigan. Pray let me have 10,000 or 12,000 men from the East, so that I may take the field immediately.
