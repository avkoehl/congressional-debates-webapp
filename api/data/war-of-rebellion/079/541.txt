Colonel P. SIDNEY POST,

Commanding Second Brigade:

COLONEL: We are ordered to move at once without transportation for Pulaski, Tenn. The garrison at this post will be immediately with-drawn, and no troops or guards will remain. You will, therefore, order Colonel McConnell, Seventy-first Ohio, to destroy the ordnance and ordnance stores shown by the accompanying invoice,* for which he has applied for transportation, as it cannot be furnished. As we will be obliged to ford Elk River you will give similar orders to all your regimental commanders who have ordnance stores on hand that have to be transported.
