picked up by our men. We disabled two of the enemy's guns, one by bursting, which fell into our possession, and captured about 100 prisoners. We have to mourn the loss of Colonel Richards, of the Twentieth Illinois, who was killed while gallantly encouraging his men. Colonel Ed. S. McCook, Thirty-first Illinois, was wounded in the foot. These, as far as I know, are the only casualties of the field officers. As soon as the returns are in, I will give you full particulars. Two rebel colonels are known to have been killed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. McPHERSON,

Major-General.
