WASHINGTON, November 11, 1863.

General MEREDITH:

Send forward to City Point an agent of the Sanitary Commission, if one should report to you, and aid him in the attainment of the humane object of the Commission, holding in reserve only the point of not compromising the Government. Afford the agent all of your facilities for intercourse with our suffering prisoners in Richmond.

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

WASHINGTON, November 11, 1863.

General MEREDITH:

You will please report upon the condition of the paroled prisoners recently [sent] from City Point to Annapolis, and report what convenience they had suitable for men in their condition on their way to Fort Monroe, and what, if any, assistance was given at Fort Monroe.

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., November 11, 1863.

Brigadier General L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: In view of the closer restrictions which may have to be placed on prisoners of war in a short time, I have the honor to recommend that three companies be added to the guard at the depot on Johnson's Island, near Sandusky, making seven companies in all, and that the whole be placed under the command of an energetic and reliable officer of senior rank to the present commander, Lieutenant Colonel W. S. Pierson. As the bay may be expected to be frozen over before the end of the month, it is necessary that orders should be given at once, so that the necessary accommodations may be made while the crossing is not interrupted by ice. The cheapest mode of quartering the companies will be to furnish them lumber and let them hut themselves.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Colonel J. ROBERTS, Commanding Fort Monroe, Va.:

COLONEL: Since writing my letter of yesterday directing the transfer of General Lee to Johnson's Island it has been found advisable to defer the execution of the order for the present, and you will therefore please send him to Fort Lafayette, N. Y. Harbor. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.
