York alone that this system of party tactics has 11
found favor It pievails to a consideiable extent
in Pennsylvania, n. iNew Jeisey, in Miine, and
it his absolute control in New Hampshne. In
how manv other States it has made a successful
lodgment, I know not. I am aware that it may
be at-kcd what danger there is in all this, either
to the prosperity or the liberties or the country'
This is precisely the point to which I invoke the
serious attention of those who heai me I wish
I could extend my voice to the utmost bounds of
the country in the discussion of this point.
Without intending to impute mercenaiy mo-
tues to all its members, I maintain that such a
party must necessarily and inevitably become
mercenary, and utterly regardless of all consist-
ency and sound principle. In whatevei State this
has become the established piactice of the domi-
nant or of antagonist parties, there you will find
the most flagrant instances of sudden changes,
not only in the course of individuals, but of en-
tire patties, whenever party interests aie con-
cerned—the most con upt piactiees in the public
administration, the gieatest excesses and abuses
in elections, and the most degiaded state of public
moials These attributes ot a coi iiiptand vicious
party association are moie visible and striking in
evtrv State wheie it exists, in proportion to the
amount of Executive pationage In some States,
in which the judges are appointed for short teims,
the> are compelled to share the fate of eveiy other
official incumbent. But how can any other mo-
tive or interest than the success of the party be-
come the leading and governing one, when every
officer of the State and of the United States, from
the highest to the lowest, in the United States
trom the head of a Department down to a petty
postmaster, or a gauger in the customs, and in
the States from the judge of a court down to the
cleik of an wfenoi couit, or a lock-keeper upon
a canal, must be removed to give place to the
hungry partisans of a new and tnumphant party'
ho length ol service, no degiee of fidelity in the
discharge of official duties, no state of depend-
ence upon the receipts of an office, however small,
can save the wretched incumbent from the gen-
eral law of the html, the fate of the conqueied.
Besides the general &et vility and hypocrisy which
such a practice cannot fail to introduce, a long
train of evils besides is obliged to follow from the
success of a political combination of this nature.
Incompeteutand unfaithful officers and agents are
thrust into the most important public stations,
the public service and interest suffer accordingly.
Subordinate officers, instead of relying upon then
diligence, skill, and fidelity in the discharge of
tlieir official duties, for their continuance in office,
comoromise with their consciences for a neglect of
duty by contubuting largely to the success of the
party in the management of caucuses, public
meetings, and elections, they look to the chiefs
of the party to connive at their delinquencies, and
to sustain them in office in consideration of their
zeal and activity in the general cause. It follows,
for the same reasons, that the first offices in the
State and General Governments are liable to be
filled by men equally incompetent and unfaithful.
It matters not who is Governor of a State oi Pres- ,[
ident of the United States, what may be his pnn- .
ciples, his personal or political character, pro- I1
vided he possesses what is called party fidelity, |
and has tact enough to wield the patronage and i
influence of his office according to party law and
usage, and so as to advance, not the cause of the
country, but of the party'
If it be true that any party avows the doctrine
that to the victor belongs the spoils of office, if it
be true that it is the practice of that party to put
none into office but those of their own party and
suffer none to remain in office but such as are al-
ready, oi may be willing to become, partisans of
those in power, can a President elected by such a
party choose to do otherwise than to use the pat-
ronage of the Government intrusted to him by
the laws and Constitution, according to the same
rule' Must he not, in the first place, so distrib-
ute it as to secure his own election for a second
term; and afterwards, is he not bound by the laws
and usages of the party of which he is the official
head, to use his whole influence, and the entire
means in his hands, to secure the election of that
man for his successor who shall be chosen accord-
River and Harbor Bill—Mr. Bell.
ing to the same paity usage, to wit. a national
caucus, which brought him into power' I repeat
the question, can he do otherwise than mterfeie
in elections, and employ the whole pationage of
the Government in controlling them ' If I am not
mistaken in this, a Piesident elected by means of
this system is, by the act of his induction into
power, by the vet y terms of his engagement with
his political associates, bound to prostitute those
gi eat powers and that immense pationage intrusted
to him by the Constitution, to be administeied
exclusively foi the good of the whole counti y, to
objects of individual aggrandizement and ambi-
tion. The seeds, then, of this mischief of Ex-
ecutive interference are sown much deeper than
one would suppose, upon a superficial view of the
subject They lie deeply imbedded in this new
system of party tactics and discipline which tlneat-
ens to fasten its deadly and conupUng fangs upon
every State of this Union. Whatever blame,
theiefore, may attach, in the mind of any, to the
course of the Piesident upon this subject, let the
responsibility be attached to the sources of the
evil—let it be traced to its proper head. Having
shown that this practice of Executive inteiference
is a necessary lcsult of a principle of party asso-
ciation, let any one attempt to stiain his fancy to
conceive all the consequences of the success of
this system—thedegiadation of the national char-
acter, the mean grade of ambition which must
distinguish the leading men of the country, tne
general corruption
Wnl any man heieafter affirm that the one hun-
dred thousand officeholders, agents, contractors,
and dependents upon the Government in some
form or other, are any longei to be safely trusted
with the right of suffiage in the elections of a fiee
people' Sir, the frienus of the purity and free-
dom of the elective franchise in thiscountry should
take a lesson upon this subject fiom the practice
of a Govemment in form less fiee than our own
—I mean Gieat Lin tain, and I beg leave to refei
to hei statutes, not only lor depriving the official
dependents upon the Government from voting,

But the obligation of party service which at-
taches to all officeholders under this new system
extends far beyond a mere espousal of the in-
terests of the paity in power. Each one ts bound
to show himself worthy of his station, and to
lender a full equivalent for his office, by his zeal
and success in controlling the sentiments and
politics of his particular district or community.
But this is not the full extent of the danger which
threatens, fiom this source, the freedom of elec-
tions. Besides the corps of actual incumbents
and dependents of all sorts upon the Government,
there are in the United States, probably, one hun-
dred thousand men who are either actua1 office-
seekers or who may be induced to give their in-
fluence and their votes in favor of the dominant
party, by the promise of office, however deceitful
that may be, in thousands of instances.
Let any one attempt to calculate the force and
influence of a band of two hundred thousand par-
tisans of any man or any party in power in this
country, united and goaded on by the hope of
reward, or afeehng of dependence for their piaces,
and, in many instances, for the very subsistence
of their families, upon the success of their efforts
I in a common cause. Who will undertake to esti-
mate the effects to be produced, not only upon
the spirit but the very forms of this Government,
by the introduction into the service of a success-
ful paity, and for its protection and suppoit,of a
guard of one hundred thousand men, who hold
I their employment by the tenure of party service,
I and these distributed over the whole Union, dif-
fused among the whole people—all acting by one
impulse, and with a view to a common end ' Sir,
these are, hereafter, to constitute the Praetorian
guards of Amenca to ratify the appointment of
a successor by the Executive. I have read that
there was a time, since the Revolution, when
there was dangei of the ascendency of monarch-
ical principles; but,sir,never hasanything tended
so dnectly to such a result, and that at no very
distant period, as the countenance which is now
given by a large proportion of the people to the
doctrines and practices of this new party. In one
view of the subject, it would be just to denounce
evei y supporter of this new system of party tac-
tics as a monarchist; for it is not the intention,
but the tendency—the result of measures and
practices Which constitute their supporters mon-
archists, or otherwise. That each successive
President will appoint his successor, if this sys-
tem shall once be firmly established in practice,
and fairly ingrafted upon all the States, is as cer-
tain as that the sun shines this day in the heavens;
and this will continue, until by some terrible
shock, by some outrage, most commonly the re-
sult of the long continuance of power in the same
hands, the people shall be roused to resistance.
Even now, sir—even now, when this hydia has
•hot forth less than half its monstrous progeny,
does not every member of this House know and
feel—does not every sharp-sighted office-holder
and office-seeker throughout the Union know and
