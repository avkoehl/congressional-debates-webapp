timber consumed in the different structures on the roads is given. All other materials, except cross-ties and railroad iron, is, or should be, accounted for in the store-house report:

The total number of cross-ties used in new track and on repairs was 111,100.

For information in regard to the timber, wood, cross-ties, &amp;c., now on hand, see Exhibit B (report of J. M. Lindley, would and tie agent), attached to this report.* Not having been furnished with an account of the railroad iron sent here, I cannot make an accurate report of the amount consumed. For the new track laid we straightened and used a great deal of damaged iron. In many cases we had to lay without chairs, because those sent with the iron did not fit it. Your attention is called to Exhibit A, attached to this report (the store-house report signed by Captain Starkweather).* It purports to give the amount of stores and materials received, consumed, and remaining on hand. The report is evidently inaccurate in regard to lumber and some other items. It is also proper to state that many of the tools and other articles reported as on hand are worn out and worthless. Exhibit C contains accurate plans of all bridges built, together with a plan of the wharves at Morehead City.* Below please find tabular statements of cars and engines on the military railroads in this department. And here I take occasion to say that nearly all the captured stock is worthless. Very little of it is worth even temporary repairs. Of course the best was run off to escape capture, but since the "rebellion has been crushed," and the different railroad companies have commenced operating their roads again, much of this has made its appearance, and we have thus had a good opportunity to judge of the condition of the rolling-stock in the "Confederacy." It was nearly worn out. A tabular statement is also given of the loaded cars moved on the military railroads in this department during seventy-four days ending May 1, 1865.
