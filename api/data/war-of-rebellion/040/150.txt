discouraged with their arms, and in several instances the men of that regiment have deserted to the enemy.

One company mutinied rather than go on picket.

Very respectfully,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

DUMFRIES, March 20, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel H. C. RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Clifford, the scout, has reported. Cannot some cavalry be assigned temporarily for duty here? Can subsist and forage them better than they can themselves, thereby saving the Government considerable expense. Without cavalry, it would be madness for him to venture outside my lines without support, as the enemy are in the immediate vicinity, pressing men into their service, and driving Union families from their homes. The country between the Quantico and Maple Valley is open, as far as I can learn. Small parties are heard from daily, robbing, &amp;c.

CHAS. CANDY,

Colonel, &c.

BALTIMORE, March 20, 1863.
