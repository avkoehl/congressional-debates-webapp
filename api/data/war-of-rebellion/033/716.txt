PATTERSON, MO., November 25, 1863.

Brigadier-General FISK:

Captain Johns has sent in a dispatch stating that the enemy, under General McRae, are at Doniphan, 1,200 strong; that they staid at Doniphan the night of the 23rd. I do not think there are that many, but I think there are 500 of them. McRae is in command. Johns thinks I will be attacked this morning. Johns will be in to-day. All quiet so far. I will be on hand, no odds how many come. My men are all awake.
