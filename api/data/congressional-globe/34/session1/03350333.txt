The CLERK. The previous question is pend-
ing, and debate is out of order.
Mr. SANDLJDG-E. If the pending proposi-
tion be rejected, I now give notice that I shall in-
troduce what I send to the Clerk's desk, to be
read for information:
Whereas, the House, on the 28th instant, having declared
that auy agitation of the question of slavery, m or out of
Congress, is unwise, unjust to a portion l*ie American
people, injurious to every section of our country, and there-
foie, should not be countenanced : Therefore,
Resolved, (a majority of the House agreeing thereto,)
That the friends of non-agitation, as declared in the afore-
said resolution, will meet Tn the Hall of the House of Rep-
resentatives, at seven o'clock this evening; and taking
tlfcit as their only basis of action or of inquiry, will, in pub-
he assemblage, agree upon some man as a candidate for the
speakeiship, who, if there is no election before, shall be
v-oted for during six ballotmgs, and no longer.

Pending the call of the roll,
Mr. HERBERT said: Mr. Clerk, as I think
there are on the table propositions which I prefer
to the plurality rule, 1 will vote against its adop-
tion until action lias been had on them. 1 vote no.
MORDECAI OLIVER.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. 1 offer the follow-
ing resolution for the adoption of the House. I
do not desire and shall not make a speech. The
gentleman named in my resolution is known to
the House; and I am willing that members shall
vote for him or not, as they choose. I tender it
as the olive-branch of peace to the now distracted
elements of this House. I call for the previous
question.
The call for the previous question received a
second.
The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:
Resolved, ThatMoRDEe.u Oi.ivfr, a Representative from
the State ol Missoiui,he, and he heieby is, chosen Speaker
ot the House of Representatives,.
Mr. SANDIDGE. Before the last vote was
taken, I gave notice of a proposition that it was
my intention to oiler; and I would ask the Clerk
whether that proposition does not now come up
in order?
The CLERK. It does not.
The main question was ordered to be now put.
Mr. MATTESON. I move that the resolu-
tion be laid on the table; and on that motion call
for the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I hope that the
gentleman from New York will withdraw the
motion to lay on the table, so that there may be
a direct vote on my proposition; it will take no
longer than the vote to lay on the table.
Mr. ORR. Mr. Cleik, I desire to say that the
resolution of the gentleman from Tennessee meets
>vith my entire approbation, and I hope that it
may be adopted.
Mr. BARCLAY. I wish to say a word.
The CLERK. Debate is out of order.
Mr. BARCLAY. I wish to inquire whether
my triend from South Carolina declines as the
Democratic candidate.
The CLERK. Debate is not in order.

MR. LETCHER'S PROPOSITION.
Mr. LETCHER. Mr. Clerk, I desire to offer
the resolution of which I gave notice on yesterday.
The Clerk read the resolution, as follows: „
Resolved, That Na.th\niel P. Banks, Jr., James L. Orr,
and IIlnry M. FoLLrn. be appointed to confer together,
and icpoit the name of come member of this House (upon
whom they, or a majority of them, may agiee,) who shall
be deflated the Speaket of the Thirty-Fourth Congre;-s.
Resolved, That the said committee repoitto-morrow, im-
mediately after the reading of the Journal,
Mr. LETCHER. Mr. Clerk, I only desire
to say that various expedients have been tried,
various votes have been taken, and it seems to me
that every attempt has been made to show that it,
ii is impossible, on any direct vote by members of
this body, to electa Speaker for the Thirty-Fourth
Congress. If, sir, this expedient will secure it, it
will carry joy throughout the country, and show
to the people of this land that "Order, Heaven's
first law, "now reians in the National Legislature.
I call for the previous question.
Mr. MORGAN. I move that the resolution be
laid on the table.
Mr. HOUSTON. I demand the yeas and nays
on that motion.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken, and the motion was
disagreed to—yeas J0^, nays 94; as follows:

So the resolution was laid on table.
GILCHRIST PORTER.
Mr. LINDLEY. I offer the following resolu-
tion: •
Rzsolrprf, That Gilchrist Porter, of Missouri, be de-
claied Speaker of the Thirty-Fourth uongress.
Mr. Clerk, 1 here present the name of a gen-
tleman who is not, I think, objectionable to
either of the parties here. He is not one of the
Know Nothings, who arc so much hated; lie is
not one of the Democrats, who are not liked by
others; and ho certainly has no leaning towards
Republicanism. He is an old-fashioned Whig;
and, as I remarked yesterday, everybody seems
to admire the gallant old Whig party, now that
they say it is dead. Certainly, if he has no party
in this House, he could not do any very great
harm; and, as I understand it, we do not require
a Speaker who will do so much good, but rather
one who will not do any harm. If gentlemen
really desire to elect a Speaker and organize the
House, let them vote for this resolution. I move,
the previous question.
Mr. WASHBURNJE, of Illinois. I second it.
The mam question was ordered.
Mr. SAGE. I move to lay the resolution on,
the table.
The yeas and nays were demanded and ordered.
The question was then taken; and it was de-
cided in the affirmative—yeas 144, nays 68; as
follows:

So the resolution wns laid upon the table.
After the call of the roll, and before the result
was announced,
Mr. RICHARDSON said: I desire to say that
as my vote, as it now stands, cannot affect the
result, and as I do not desire to be placed in a
position that would require explanation here-
aftei, I thciefore change it. If it would affect the
result, I would leave it as it is. I changc from
no to ay.
Mr. DOWDELL. Understanding that the
gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Porter] has de-
nounced the Nebraska bill during the present
session of Congress, I shall change my vote. I
vote ay.
Mr.'CASKIE. Before the vote is announced,
I wish to makeastatementtothe House. There
has been a good deal of difficulty, Mr. Clerk, in
the minds of many members, while you have
been calling the roll, in reference to the position
of the gentleman from Missouri [Mr. Porter]
upon the Kansas-Nebraska bill. In answer to a
question put to him by myself on that subject, a
