tures for the day are 10 prisoners, including Captain Haskins, an English officer of seven years' service, now in Confederate service, and Lieutenant Chapman, who had charge of the artillery. both these officers, so severely wounded, could not be removed, and were paroled. I send in other prisoners by train to-day.

The enemy lost heavily in wounded, as they received a terrific fire from revolvers at close range, followed by a determined saber charge. Many were severely cut with saber, but clung to their horses and fell back into the thicket. Our horses were completely blown when we had overtaken the enemy, so rapid had been our pursuit, and, after thoroughly scattering them to all points in that thick country, I found it impossible to follow up with hope of catching them.

Lieutenant Barker has two grape-shot through thigh, but is quite comfortable. He crossed sabers with them, and fought desperately after this wound.

General Buford arrived at Catlett's at 4 p.m. yesterday with his force from Dumfries; communicated with me. Some artillery firing was heard last night, 8 p.m., in direction of Kelly's Ford, but I presume amounted to nothing. All is quiet this a.m.

Can't I have balance of my regiment here, as I should like to have them together?

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. D. MANN,

Commanding.

Major H. BALDWIN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fairfax Court-House.
