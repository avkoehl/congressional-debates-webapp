mexican protectorate.
Mr. HOUSTON. I ask that the resolution
| which I offered yesterday, in relation to the estab-
j lishmentofan eificient protectorate by the United
! States over the States of Mexico, Nicaragua,
j Costa Rica, Guatemala, Honduras, and San Sal-
| vador, be now taken up, with a view to its refer-
! ence to the Committee on Foreign Relations.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be referred,
if there be no objection.
Mr. WILSON. I wish to hear the resolution
read.
The Secretary read it, as follows;
Wherea?, the events connected with the numerous efforts
of the people of Mexico, and of Central America, of this
continent, to establish and maintain order and good govern-
ment, since their separation from the mothei country, have
so far resulted in failure and consequent anarchy, and de-
monstrated to the world the inability of said people to effect
an object alike so desuabie and so indispensable to their
welfare and prosperity : Therefore,
Resolved) That the Committee on Foreign Relations be
instructed to inquire into and report to the Senate upon the
expediency of the Government of tiie United States de-
claring and maintaining an efficient protectorate over the
States of Mexico, Nicaragua, Costa Rica, Guatemala, Hon-
duras, and San Salvador, in such form and to such an
ex-rent as shall be necessary to secure to the people of said
States the blessings of good and stable republican govern-
ment.
Mr. HOUSTON. I move that the resolution
be taken up for consideration.
The motion to take up the resolution was
agreed to.
Mr. WILSON. I do not rise for the purpose
of opposing the reference of this resolution, fori
have no special objection at any time to refer res-
olutions of any description to committees, for the
purpose ofinvestigation; but I should like, before
it goes to the committee, as this is a resolution
of a most extraordinary character, that the hon-
orable Senator from Texas, who has introduced
it, shall explain to us what he wishes to attain by
it. It seems to me that this resolution, which
declares that nations with which we are at peace
have failed in their own government since they
have been independent nations, and that there-
fore we should extend over them a protectorate,
and assume to govern them, is certainly a most ex-
traordinary one. Whatever may be its object, or
its purpose, it really seems to me thatitis intend-
ed to encourage that spirit of filibustering which
has disgraced this country in the face ofthe Chris-
tian and civilized world. Instead of repressing
the tendency of such enterprises, I think it will
encourage that very spirit which I understood the
honorable Senator from Texas the other day to
denounce on this floor, in regard to Walker and
Nicaragua.
Mr. HOUSTON. I believe it is unusual, in a
ease of this kind, to object to the reference of res-
olutions.
Mr. WADE. I will ask the Senator from
Texas whether this resolution does not "instruct"
the committee? and therefore its adoption by the
Senate becomes necessary before it can go to the
committee.
Mr. HOUSTON. It instructs them to report,
hut not in any particular way.
Mr. WADE. It instructs them to make an
inquiry.
Mr. HOUSTON. To inquire into and report.
Mr. SEWARD. Let it be read once more.
The Secretary again read the preamble and res-
olution.
Mr. HOUSTON. Mr. President, as I hay*,
remarked, it is, I believe, unusual, at this stage
of business, to object to a resolution of inquiry.
This resolution lays down to the committee no
particular course of conduct to pursue. In the
first place, we are aware that the people of the
regions referred to are not in a very settled and
regulated condition; and supposing that the sources
of information would be open to the committee,
I have offered this resolution, instructing them to
inquire into the causes of the evils in those Gov-
ernments,and, if they thought proper, to suggest
a remedy. With these views I have proposed to
refer it to them; but they are not bound by it to
recommend a remedy. They aresimply instructed
to ascertain the cause of the evils, and by their re-
port impart to the nation very useful information.
It was not with a view of eliciting opposition that
the resolution was introduced, nor did i expect
any. I supposed the committee the most compe-
tent to attain the object for which it was intended.
I am sorry that the gentleman from Massachu-
setts has supposed that it was my object, or that
this resolution could have a tendency, to foster
the filibustering spirit that is abroad in the land.
The very opposite was my belief and my inten-
tion. I have always denounced fillibusterism,
when upon individual enterprise such schemes
were conducted; and I shall never cease to do it.
But, sir, we are aware that these people, for a
