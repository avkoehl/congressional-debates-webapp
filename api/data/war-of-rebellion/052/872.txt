HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, September 26, 1863.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,Comdg. Confederate Forces in front of Chattanooga:

GENERAL: I presume that our wounded left in your hands will receive such care and attention as it is possible for you to accord, but as medical supplies and food for the large numbers wounded in the late battle may not be sufficient, I should be glad to aid in caring for these of our army. To this end, if it meets your views, I will send and bring within our lines, after they have been paroled, such of them as can be transported, and will send such medical supplies as may be necessary for the comfort of those who remain.

Colonel McKibbin, aide-de-camp, accompanied by Majors Dana and Bond and Captain Swaim, will bear this communication and await your reply.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General, Commanding.
