Mr F wished to call the attention of the committee to the

Theneces^ity forseMme the public bond* at a discount aiose
not fiom any disbelief m the ability of the Government tore
pay money borrowed, but fiom the fact that the easting state
of the countiy made money woith moreihan the ordmaiy inte-
rest offered by the Government. An illustration of the trmhéf
this might be seen m Mr F'sowh State. The State of Hew
York had a certain revenue, abundantly sufficient to meet the
interest of her securities wherr duet and to redeem -the principal
with the utmost certainty, andthismdependent of &Í1 legishuioc,
the income bemg drawn from a fund pledge already; and yet
her bonds, bearing an interest of six per cent, were aeíJíng ire
the market at a discount of twenty percent, and those at^ve
per cent at a rate still lower. And this not because aoy man
dreamed that the State would fail to pay the money, butfee-
cause they who had money coull use it to more advantage.
I he note of no puvate individual, be his credit what it might—
the note of John Jacob Astor himself—would not sell at par, be-
cause money was worth more than the legal interest which the
note would command Insuch a state of things, if this Govern-
ment entered the market aa a borrower, it must expect to give
the same rates as others, m not to get the mpney it wanted It
had, therefore, this alternative, to let its notes be rfnderproten
and its credit be dishonoi ed, oi to part with us bonds for cash at
a discount Mr r could not hesitate which to choose; and
nothing should be wanting on his part to provide for meet-
ing the public engagements with promptitude He offered
tins amendment by direction of the Committee of Ways and
Means
And here he wmted to say one word about the addition to
the loan of hve millions of dollars He regretted thatj while in
Committee ofthe Whole, he had had ho opportunity, as he had
hoped to have, of explaining at large the provisions of this bill,
and the existing situation ofthe Treasury he had expected to-
do this, but the coin se of ihe debate had put it out of his power.
He should now say as little as postable, for he was suffering un-
dei a hoai seness which made evei y word a pain
It would be recollected that the Secretary of the Treasury, in
his annual report, stated the situatation of the Treasury to he
such as to leave a d fiat of $14,218,570 tobe provided for Hera
Mr F quoted the íeported the repot t to show how thisbaiance
wasmadeout The Secietaiy proposed, m order to meetit, a
a loan of six and a half millions and an issue of issue of Treasury
notes of five millions Thisstilllefta balance of $2718,570 un-
ptovided foi, besides which, he asked for a surplus of two mil-
lions more, to be kft in the Treasury as a reserve to meet con-
tingent demands, making the unpiovided balance #4,718,570.
The iiou-se had authorized the issue of five millions ofTreasury
now, and the re&idoe of ihe twelve million loan, still leaving
this balan e of ©4 7 H 570 unpiovided for To meet this, the
bil I authot ized an additional loan ol five millions
The Secretaiy estimate!, as one elementof his calculation,
nineUen milhonsas the result of the customs for the piesent
yen When this estimate wa=  made( who could have antici
pated all that has since occuned to i educe this amoant? So great
had been the stagnation of business and the fall of the national
ciedtt, that theimports,and consequently theduties, mustsufFer
a great failing off The experience of theTieasury thus fat
ft drian ed the conclusion that this diminution could not be less
than a million of dollars it was hktly tobe more, and the whole
calculation showed that at the end ofthe year there would be a
deficit of five and a half millions
The Seci etary had proposed to add to the present bilí a sum
sufficient to meet the amount of IVasury notes out at the close
oí the yeai, which, in pieparmsr the bill, had accordingly been
done But the Committee of Ways and Means, on looking
in o the documents from the Treasuiy, had found no estimate
of that amount of notes still due at the end of the year, and on
thai ground had ordued him to move an amendmeut striking
out the clause for the addition to the loan of five millions more
Subsequently however, it was di&coveied by the Secretaiy that
the estimates lor Tieasuiy notea to remain due had, by acleri*
cal inadvertence, been omitted to be sent to the committee,* and
on those estimates coming in, they found that the sum wanted
to meettheTieasiry noes that would remain out would be
©5,000,800 As the original clause had proposed $5,000,000,
they did not chink it woith while to alter it forso small a diffe-
rence, and therefore it wa& 'hat he had witrhdrawn the amend-
mtnt going to stuke out the five nulhwi cldust, and sufíeiedit
to stand as it now stood on the face of the bill
After some explanatory remarks as to how the mistake above
alluded to had been accounted foi by the Secretary, Mr r took
occisión to ¡?iy, injustice to that office!, that from his own per
son?! and uihual intercourse with him, he had received strongly
theimpies«ion thatjiewas in the fullest sense of the word an
huueatman, but he was overwhelmed with a load of responsi
bihty and labor enough to crush any man Accoiding to the
present calculaimns of the Department, the actual deficit for the
piesentquaitei takins all the Tiea&ury notes into the account,
would bt four and a half millions of dolíais And unless gen
tlemen wcie willing to sec the Government from month to
month contracting new loans, he uu^ted they would now pro
