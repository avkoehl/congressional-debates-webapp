BATTERY Numbers 2, Via Royall's House, July 2, 1864-7.30 p. m.

Three hundred men are all the force you have sent me. The enemy are throwing up works 600 yards this side of the causeways and have four guns in position. Unless more troops are sent me it will be impossible to drive the enemy off, as I am anxious to do. I fear if they are allowed to remain they will throw up works and occupy their present position permanently, in which case our picket-lines will be too much lengthened. I have been firing on them with heavy and light guns all day. I shall feel them and see what can be done. My estimate of the enemy's force is 3,000 at least. After reducing the garrisons at Johnson and Haskell as much as is safe, ours in not half the number with the re-enforcement available for attack. I should like to have additional light artillery. A monitor and three more gun-boats in the Stono now visible from Battery Numbers 2. You must send more troops.

Brigadier-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

ROYALL'S HOUSE, July 2, 1864-11.25 p. m.

Three hundred and seventy-five men, consisting of the companies of Thirty-second Georgia Regiment, Bureau Battalion, and Naval Battalion, are all that have reported. Nothing has been heard of the Fire Battalion. Major Lucas reports five steamers in Stono, some of them transports, below the steamers, barges, and launches, crowded with troops. Can you do send Hayne's company to Pringle? Can the Cadets be sent over? No guns are required for Pe Dee Artillery; they are best as infantry. The enemy are still in line of battle, but had stopped working just before dark; just reported that barges are assembling in the Stono, around the monitor which lies near Grimball's Landing.
