FORT MONROE, VA., June 18, 1863.

(Received 12. 10 p. m.)

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I am moving troops from Suffolk up the York. I had no transports till yesterday. Part of a brigade went up this morning. Gordon, with 5, 000 men, is between Diascund Bridge and White House. Last week a brigade went from Franklin, by way of Wedon, to Petersburg. The force I sent out to the Blackwater brought them back to Franklin on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday. My cavalry could not get across the river. Every ford was blockaded and defended. The troops are now coming into Suffolk. I have removed the heavy guns to the new lines. The movements referred to in your dispatch,, just received, will be made as rapidly as possible.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, June 18, 1863.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

A detailed report from Major [J. N.] Wheelan is just received. He was for six days actively and vigilantly employed in searching for the escaped prisoners, making severe marches and traversing three counties. He finally ascertained at Elizabeth City that they crossed in three detachments at the mouth of Pasquotank River, rounding the point of Pasquotank County into the Little River. Major Wheelan's action was prompt and vigorous, and he is much disappointed.

MICHAEL CORCORAN,

Brigadier-General.
