TERRY'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 17, 1864-6 a.m.

Colonel SHAFFER:

I have re-enforced the picket-line four regiments, making seven in all. I think the force now there will be sufficient.

A. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 17, 1864.

General TERRY:

What heavy firing of infantry this morning? What news from the front?

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

TERRY'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 17, 1864-6.15 a.m.

Major-General BUTLER:

The heavy firing was from a strong attack on the picket-line. The firing has now ceased and the line is so re-enforced as to be, in my opinion, secure. General Wright's troops lie behind the center ready to move.

A. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL BUTLER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 17, 1864-8 a.m. (Received 8.05 a.m.)

The commanding general directs that you cease firing that gun.

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
