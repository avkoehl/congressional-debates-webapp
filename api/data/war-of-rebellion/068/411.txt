Major-General MEADE,

Headquarters Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: We barely hold our own: on the right the pressure is heavy. General Hancock thinks he can hold the plank and Brock roads, in front of which he is, but he can't advance.

THEO. LYMAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Volunteer Aide-de-Camp.

Fresh troops would be most advisable.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS.

May 5, 1864-6.14 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

A new line of fire farther to the left has been heard (skirmish fire); an advance of cavalry coming down the Brock road has been seen. Nothing but skirmishing as yet; yet Gibbon had better be prepared to come up if other firing is heard.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. - The signal officer reports that where line of fire was seen first to the left he can observe cavalry, but nothing else.

[NOTE IN PENCIL.] - The original of this dispatch was sent to Major-General Meade by an orderly.
