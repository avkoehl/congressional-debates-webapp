at Liberty and scout after them. I have advised Independence, Pleasant Hill, and Holden of the movement of the rebels. Send a steam-boat from Kansas City to Liberty Landing to cross your forces. Take the ferry-boat if there is no other.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., July 22, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have just received the following dispatch from Colonel Ford:

IN THE FIELD, NEAR INFANTRY,

July 22, 1864-2 a.m.

General FISK:

The people in the country north, east, and west of this place are largely joining Thornton, and his forces are largely increasing. Colonel Draper, with his command, is still with me. I shall move with my whole command in ten minutes. Thornton will probably have by night 1,500 or 2,000 men.

J. H. FORD.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., July 22, 1864.

Brigadier-General BROWN:

Colonel Ford left Liberty this morning at 7 o'clock and has gone north with his whole command.

By order of Colonel James H. Ford:

J. S. CLEVELAND,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 22, 1864.

Colonel JAMES H. FORD,

Kansas City, Mo.:

The general is fearful about arms going into Missouri, but has sent General Fisk about all we ought to spare. We have a rumor that Liberty was burned this a.m. What news have you? General Fisk says there are 1,000 rebels in Plattsburg and vicinity.

S. S. CURTIS,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

KANSAS CITY, July 22, 1864.

Major S. S. CURTIS,

Fort Leavenworth:

I have just received a dispatch from Colonel Ford. He was at Liberty this morning at 4 o'clock, but has since left. He said nothing about Liberty being burnt. The colonel says Thornton has from 1,500 to 2,000 men. They have gone north. I start a messenger to Colonel Ford in thirty minutes.

Respectfully,

JAS. S. CLEVELAND,
