ing your last. About 7 o'clock he informed me that he had no news from the east other than what we already know. I have my cavalry well advanced on all roads, and scouts on the Bolivar road. Will keep you advised from time to time. We are all right side up with care here.

Colonel W. H. MORGAN,

Major-General.

LA GRANGE, December 2, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Hurst says that there are 600 of the enemy at Saulsbury and that he proposes to move on them at 4 to-morrow morning. My scouts on the Bolivar and Davis' Mill roads have not reported. I am of the opinion that the enemy will move south before daylight, if he has not already done so; nevertheless, I will keep a bright lookout for him at an early hour to-morrow morning.

Respectfully,

WILLIAM H. MORGAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.- I have had no communication with General Tuttle or hatch, but cannot but think that they will be after them at early dawn.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

Mizner reports skirmishing ceased at sunset at Ruckersville; enemy encamped short distance below there. He has fallen back behind the cross-roads. I may expect the enemy about Florence.
