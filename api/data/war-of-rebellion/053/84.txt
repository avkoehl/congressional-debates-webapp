ridge at unpainted house east of this fort moved down the west side of the ridge, leaving the crest at the right corner of fence around the house where headquarters are supposed to be. This morning a heavy column of infantry came into view at unpainted house and moved along crest in the same direction. A very heavy column of infantry are now moving to our left from a point of timber southeast of fort. They are moving about midway along the side of the ridge. The camp-fires of the enemy last night were much increased. At fortifications southeast of this fort they were more numerous than at any other point. Along the foot of the ridge there were appearances of camp-fires extending farther to the left than I have ever seen them, and opposite the left of General Van Cleve's division.

Respectfully,

L. M. DE MOTTE,

Lieutenant and Acting Signal Officer.
