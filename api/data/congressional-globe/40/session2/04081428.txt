farmers' axd citizens' bask.
Mr. MORGAN. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Finance, to whom was referred the
joint resolution (II. R. No. 105) authorizing
the Comptroller of the Currency to revoke the
appointment of receiver for the Farmers' and
Citizens' National Bank of Williamsburg, New*
\ ork, and to restore said bank to its owners
under certain conditions, to report it back with-
out amendment and recommend its passage.
As this is a joint resolution from the House of
Representatives, which has passed that body
with great unanimity, and is quite important
to the locality, I ask that it may have the con-
sideration of the Senate at this time. Prompt
action is important, and I think when the reso-
lution is read there will be no objection to it.

examined the ease.
By unanimous consent, the joint resolution
was considered as in Committee of the Whole.
Ifc proposes to authorize the OoroptroPer of
the Currency, with the approval of the Sucre-
tary of the Treasury, to revoke the order ap-
pointing a receiver for the Farmers' and Citi-
zens Bank of Williamsburg, New York, and
restore Wt bank and its manaaremont to the
directors, lor the purpose of enabling the asso-
ciation to continue the business of banking;
but the banking association is first to present
to the Comptroller satisfactory assurances that
the public interest will be promoted therebv,
and to secure, in such manner as the Comp-
troller shall direct, the full payment of all tin-
creditors ol the association, and to restore the
capital stock toils original amount in ease the
capital has been impaired by losses.

orable member from New Yoik why it i3 uiut
the Comptroller has not this authority now

Mr. MORGAN. It has been found that he
has not this authority. The national bank
law does not give the Comptroller of the Cur-
