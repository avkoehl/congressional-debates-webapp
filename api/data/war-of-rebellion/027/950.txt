left of a small road leading from the main turnpike, the left extending along the summit of the mountain. We were ordered to advance down the mountain, and did so for some distance. We then formed line of battle. At this point we were me t by our pickets, who were retiring, the enemy advancing in force. I ordered the regiment to lie down. The enemy still advancing, we opened fire upon them. Our position was held until the enemy, in heavy force, both upon our extreme left and in front, were rapidly advancing and quite near. As the regiment was left entirely unsupported at that time, I ordered them to fall back, and we then formed upon the Twenty-secodn South Carolina. The enemy were still advancing and were attempting to flank us upon the left, and would probably have succeeded but for the timely support of some of our forces, who appeared upon the left. We then held our position until we were again left unsupported, and, the enemy still advancing in heavy force, I then ordered the regiment to retire a short distance, where I was met by General Rodes, who ordered me to form the regiment and hold my position. I did so, when Colonel Stevens, coming up, ordered me to form on the left of the Sixth Alabama Regiment, Colonel Gordon commanding, and to follow that regiment. I fell back with Colonel Gordon to the foot of the mountain, and then formed line of battle and remained in that position until after dark, when we were ordered to retire.

The officers and men behaved with great gallantry, and it gives me pleasure to state that they were perfectly cool under fire and did their duty nobly.

Subjoined I respectfully submit a statement of the killed, wounded, and missing.*

Yours, respectfully,

S. A. DURHAM,

Captain Company H, Commanding Regiment.

OCTOBER 16, 1862.

GENERAL: At Sharpsburg, on September 15 and 16, our regiment was under fire,which on the 16th was quite heavy. We were not, however, called into action until Wednesday, the 17th, when the regiment was deployed as skirmishers and advanced to within 100 yards of the enemy's pickets, here we held our position until all of the ammunition had been exhausted, when we were ordered to retire by Colonel Stevens, who was in command of the brigade.

Having been wounded in the fight of Sunday, the 14th, I was not able to command the regiment the whole of Wednesday, and left it in charge of Lieutenant E. R. White.

So far as I can, learn, the officers and men reflected great credit upon their native State.

Subjoined will be found a list of the casualties.+

Your, respectfully,

S. A. DURHAM,

Captain Company H, Commanding Regiment.

Brigadier General N. G. EVANS,

Commanding Brigade, South Carolina Volunteers.
