of the Senate upon the subject, he moved to make the bill the
special order of tneuay for Monday next
Mr PHCLPS prefeired to have moie time to coisider the
bill, before tlie Senate entered upin a discussion of u He
thought the day fixed was too ¡short to afford an oppuitumtv to
examine it fully
Mr WaLKCR said he hoped the Senator from Vermont
would not press his objection to naming an early d iy for the
consideration of this bit!, as it w-i  on« of gieat urgency It
was absolutely necessary tl at some mode f n the adjustment of
the claims ie erred to shoul i be provided by Congress Indeed
It had become a matter of«uch urgent necessity, that the Legis
latareofthe State of Missi 3ip~>i had taken upt'ie subject, and
had forwarded mstiuctions to the feenators of that State, to urge
upon Congiess some immediate action upon it Serious appie
hensions vveie entertained that the lend t lea of the whole State
would be distuibed Individúala whohad been cultivating their
farms in peace and quietness, imcta the bc'ief that they had de
nvedfrom theGovernmentafull and complete title, were now
threatened with ejectment The difficulty was one which hod
grown out of the negtect of Congress to cany into effect the
treaty o Dancing Kabbit creek, of 1830, and he trusted, there
fore, an early diy would be fixed for its consideiation
Mr KING said it was exceedingly dea rabie that the subject
should be taken up at as early a day as posible It was a mat
ter which afFested, also, a portion of the State which he had the
honor to represent, and it was one upon which the Senate
would, he had no doubt, be prepared to enter upon its confide
ration as soon as Monday If they weie not, it could be passed
over until a more convenient time
After a few more remarks by Mesáis MOREHEAD and
PHELPS, the bill was made the ortLr of the day for Monday

brief explanation on each, *euch is thatldl portions ot the for-
mer loan bill not rt pealed in thisshall remain in fall-force; and
all Tieasury notes outstanding, when they fall due, if not paid,
shall continue to bear interest til! redeemed, which snail be

The three points he had a firt-t mentí jned were thllnost im-
portant of the provisions in the bill, and to them he should di-
rect the attention of the Senate And filfas to the authority
to borrow five millions in addition to the twelve million loan
of the extra session It might be thotiffnt,or even urged by
those who knew better, that this sum of five millions was to be
an additional loan, independent oí the five millions in Treasury
notes lately authorized, with which and the twelve million loan
the public debt would bee jme twenty two millions It was pro-
per, however tostate at the outset, tbatahhough this additional
loan of five millions increases the funded debt, it does not actu-
al ly increase the indebtedness of the Government, and cannot do
so, unless Congress lefuses to provide adequatf means to meet
its expenses He mentioned tins because he sometimes no-
ticed in the public prints ceuainparagiaphs assuming that the
public debt is aheady twenty millions, and will be thirty mil-
lions of dollars before the end of the year Such statements
were not only reiteiated without foundation m (act 10 the news-
papers but also occasionally in documents, which ought toba
more authentic Now the specific o^ect of this additional
loan of five millions is to redeem outstanding Treasury noteaor
replace those absorbed before due by tho customs, in an-
ticipating the ordmai y means on which the Government has to
depend fcr the ordinary expenses of the year A few detail*
would explain tins matter. The outstanding Treasury notes
aie now in amount nearly nine millions—he believed $8,874,-
000     Many oí tht se Treasury notesaiefatlinsduewithm short
periods But aliare íeceivableforcustome,wwhetherdue im-
mediately or remotely, m point of time If these Treasury
notes continue at a discount m the stock maiket, it is obvious
they will be foi red hick upon the Goveinment in the payment
01  duties, and to that extent must deprive it of the ordinary
means of meeting the ordinary expenses * It is equally obviou*
th.it the Government requires all its ordinary rreansto meetit 
ordinary expenses If Treasury notes thus absorb the means
of theGovemment theycause a deficit which must be met
from other sources It is further obvious that the customscan-
not meet the expenditures of the Government, and take up
these Treasury notes His impression, therefore, was, thatthe
bill now under consideration wisely provided for a loan to ab-
sorb or replace the^e Tteasury notes, and thereby Jeave
the ordinary revenue to meet the ordinary expenses of
the Government The whole amount of the last issutó
ofTreasmy notes authorized has 1 ot been paidout, but would
have been by this time, only for the delay occasioned by the
office of Comptroller being vacant The balance to be issued
within a few days, does not exceed $900,000 The amount of
Treasury notes now lying in the Ireasury, received the ¿rat
quarter of this year for revenue, (customs and lands, but chiefly,
if not wholly for custom ,) wa^about two and a half millions of
dollars This amount has been redeemed from the current re-
venue of the yeai, and thereby Government h?s been deprived
of that amount of ordinary means to meet ordinary expenses.
That amount ought to be replaced m the Treasury out of the
loan to be authorized by this bill The balance of this five mil-*
lion loan will be wanted to absorb or rep'ace those Treasury
notes thrown back 00 the Government in ths way during the
current quarter The loan to be raised tindei the provisions of
this bill will, in effect, be eleven millions, namely, the balance
of the twelve million loan, six millions, and the additional loan
of five millions, so that witn the first half of the twelve million
ban already negotiated, the wht Ie of the public funded debt
will he seventeen millions, or, puttine it in another form, the
twelve mi lion loan oí the extra session, and tew five million
loan of this session, making togethei seventeen millions This
Mth° utmost amount of the indebtedness of the Government,
and will not be exceeded if Congress provides means adequate
for cariymgiton But if Congress chooses to let the Govern
mentgoonsirugghn" with difficulties and imdequite means,
the indebtedness will be twenty two millions, inste id of seven-
teen tnd in that event this new bin will become an addition
to the public debt alreidy existing He was sorry to say the
pio«tpect3fiom tl n ordmiry somcesof revenue, were any thing
bu  encouiagmg
At the beginning of (he year the Secteiary of the Tieasury
estimated the revenue irom all sojrees it nineteen millions—
fiom customs in putieular at $15 6001)00 This estimate has
not heen jusufiel by the receipts of the fiist quarter, nor is it
likely tobe lealized far the whole year He bad received ihe
returns from the Custom Hou«eat New York from which it
appeals that the imp'uls, compare! with tho e of the corres-
ponding part of last year have fallen off three millions averag-
ing 10 per cent on the whole amount of import^ If a similai
reduction takes* place for the rest of the yeir instead of
the customs yielding as estimated, $15 600,000, they will
vieldbut $13,500,000, leaving a defieitof two mi11 ions one han
