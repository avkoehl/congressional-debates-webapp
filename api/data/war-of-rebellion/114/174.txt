As a general rule release those who are not guilty of irregular warfare or other violations of rules of war, burning bridges, &amp;c., upon taking oath and giving bond with good security. Such as are clearly guilty of robbing and other offenses against law where the evidence is clear, turn them over to the officers of the law make them do their duty. Do not hesitate to assume any responsibility your judgment may dictate as necessary to thwart any plan of secessionists or to wrest from them any power they have civil or otherwise. They have first discarded law and have appealed to force. It is now purely a question of power not one of law. Do not hesitate to seize and hold their property. Where there is no law there is no property. If they deny the power of the Government they are without law and let them feel the consequences. We cannot temporize with them. Your extensive acquaintance will enable you to get at the facts in regard to the disloyal people in your section and enable you to dispose of them in the manner best calculated to produce good results.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel JAMES A. MULLIGAN, Chicago, Ill.

COLONEL: As the War Department does not answer my letter in relation to your enlisting poisoners of war I shall take the responsibility of authorizing you to immediately fill up your regiments in that way. Great caution, however, must be used as to the character of the persons so enlisted. You should make yourself personally acquainted with the history of each recruit received and exercise a sound discretion in the matter. The recruits should be sent to Benton Barracks where the regiment will be prepared for the field in Arkansas. I do not think it would be advisable to send hem to Tennessee or Mississippi. In Arkansas they will meet none of their old associates.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
