General ELLIOTT or THOMAS:

Have you anything from Generals Garrard and Kilpatrick!

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,August 16, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

The following received from Kilpatrick, dated August 15, 9 p. m., near Camp Creek, in route from Fairburn:

Thus army reconnaissance has been a success. I crossed the river at 11 a. m., and passed out at once for Fairburn. I forced the enemy back into his camp near railroad, five miles above the station. Destroyed the station, public buildings, telegraph and railroad for about three miles. Jackson's division of cavalry has thus far refused o give me battle. I rather expect an attempt will be made in the morning to prevent my return. This will give me the opportunity I seek to destroy Jackson and his command, provided his cavalry alone meets me.

The regiment from Garrard's division sent after a party of rebel cavalry reported as being near Vinning's Station, have returned to camp this morning. They report all quiet. Nosing of any rebels. Nothing from General Garrard's command.

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier- General and Chief of Cavalry.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Atlanta, August 16, 1864.

General ELLIOTT:

The news from General Kilpatrick is first rate. He acts in earnest. I believe General Kilpatrick, with his own and General Garrard's cavalry, could go straight for Rough and Ready, and break the Macon road all to pieces.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
