The First Brigade is on the south side of the river. The Second Brigade is crossing. Met with very little opposition.

[JNO. BUFORD.]

[Indorsement.]

[GENERAL MEADE:]

This is just received from General Buford. It is all he sends. Shall I order him to return or go on?

A. PLEASONTON.
HEADQUARTERS, Frederick, July 14, 1863-5. 10 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

Your telegram, directing all re-enforcements to be retained here until further orders, is received. In this connection, I may mention that I have been informed there are several regiments from Southeastern Virginia at Washington, awaiting transportation to this place. If this be so, they might be stopped at that point.

ED. SCHRIVER,

Inspector-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS, July 14, 1863.

GENERAL A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

The rebels crossed infantry and cavalry at a ford just above Williamsport. The ford is reported to be from 4 to 4 1/2 feet. I have sent to ascertain the exact depth. The flat-boat that the rebels used has gone down the river. They constructed pontoons at this point, where there was lumber, and floated the bridge to Falling Waters, where the greater portion of the army crossed over. There seems to have been much confusion and demoralization among them. Should the general want me to-night at headquarters, will you ask him to excuse me, as I am very much worn out? I will cheerfully accede to any measures. I have two day's rations in haversacks from to-morrow morning, and plenty of fresh beef.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.
