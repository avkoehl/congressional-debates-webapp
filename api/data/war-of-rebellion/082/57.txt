Neck. These men should have gone to the landing near their camp to have crossed the place where the command is, being nearly opposite. All quiet on my front. No more signs of activity on part of enemy.

Respectfully, yours,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, July 6, 1864.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,Chief of Staff, City Point:

Will you have the kindness to hurry up those two batteries that have come for me? My report shows an increase of enemy's artillery in my front. If you have a 100-pounder Parrott lying idle, and it meets the approbation of the lieutenant-general, would it not be well to send it to me?

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, City Point:

My artillery succeeded this afternoon in blowing up a small magazine or limber chest in the enemy's works on my left.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.

SMITH'S HEADQUARTERS, July 6, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

I have relieved the Tenth U. S. Colored Infantry and ordered them to report to you. I find it impossible to relieve the Second Cavalry (dismounted) at this time, and have been compelled to fill the position occupied by the Tenth by my detachments of cavalry. I have a partial promise that my line will be somewhat shortened. As soon as that is done I will send you the Second Cavalry (dismounted). Will this be satisfactory?

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS, July 6, 1864.

Brigadier General RUFUS INGALLS,Chief Quartermaster, City Point, Va.:

Having been disappointed in Colonel Bigg's assignment to me, I shall now have to avail myself of your assistance and rely on you to send me an officer for chief quartermaster for this corps. I trust you will send me a good one, for I would rather be without than have a poor one.

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General.
