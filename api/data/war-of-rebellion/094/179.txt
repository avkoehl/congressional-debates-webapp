PADUCAH, KY., December 13, 1864-2 p. m.

Major General G. M. DODGE:

GENERAL: I have just received a telegram from General Thomas, at Nashville, ordering me, if I had sufficient force, to move upon Loyon at Danville bridge, where he was constructing boats on the 8th instant. I respectfully request that you send me two or three regiments of infantry and some cavalry and artillery, so that I may comply with this order and enable me to drive Lyon from Danville, which force you can withdraw front his point as soon as this object is accomplished, as, circumstanced as I am at present, it is impossible for me to move from any post in my district, as I cannot muster 1,00 effective men after furnishing the requisite details. Please answer.

S. MEREDITH,

Brigadier-General.
