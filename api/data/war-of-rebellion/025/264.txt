HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, October 5, 1862-9 p. m.

Brigadier-General McKEAN,

Commanding Division:

Am coming out to Chewalla with car-load of water. No news from any of you for several hours. Ord has been heavily engaged with the enemy at Davis' Bridge. We must push on as lightly as possible. Baggage has, I understand, interfered with your progress, which certainly has not been remarkable. We must push ahead as soon as the men get a little rest, and be with them by daylight. Send messengers to Chewalla reporting your position.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

C. GODDARD,

First Lieutenant Twelfth Infty. Ohio Vols., Actg. Asst. Adjt. General

(General Davies, Stanley, Hamilton, and McPherson furnished with copies of above.)

Brigadier-General McPHERSON,

Commanding Advance:

No report from you. If you reach Chewalla ascertain if the enemy passed by Young's Bridge. Halt at that point until Stanley overtakes you. Meanwhile reconnoiter to Young's Bridge. Occupy it with a regiment and reconnoiter beyond. Push an advance guard, but not beyond support, toward Pocahontas.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

C. R. THOMPSON,

Lieutenant and Ordnance Officer.

Brigadier-General STANLEY,

Commanding Division:

Dispatch received; will send you another guide. You should have taken the road to the right, this side of Cane Creek, which keeps north of the railroad. If you are not too far advanced it would be better for you to face by the rear and do it now, as you will reach Chewalla soon
