bridge. The road and telegraph are yet all safe, and unless they attack the road below to-day we will be safe, as your cavalry will arrive at Romney, I hope, to-morrow. Is the First New York along? What time will your troops move? I am in good health, with my harness on all right.

Brigadier-General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

The troop trains have passed Green Spring and will be here in a few minutes. Mulligan attacked the enemy's advance on the Greenland Gap road late this evening and drove him back. I am yet undecided in opinion whether the attack at New Creek is not a feint, and that this is the point they intend to assail. Will be ready for them. Have you heard anything from your cavalry? I will communicate with them as soon as possible.
