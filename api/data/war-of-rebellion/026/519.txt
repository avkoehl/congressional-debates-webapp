HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA, SEVENTH ARMY CORPS,Fort Monroe, Va., January 16, 1863.

Actg. Rear-Admiral S. P. LEE,

Commanding North Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

ADMIRAL: There are indications of activity on the part of the enemy above Yorktown and also on the Blackwater. General Pryor has crossed the river and is 7 miles on this side. I am so weakened by re-enforcing General Foster in North Carolina that I can only act on the defensive. There are rumors in Norfolk of a raid from the direction of the Dismal Swamp, and General Peck telegraphs me this evening that our pickets have been fired on between Suffolk and Deep Creek. General Viele is very anxious to have a small gunboat, or, as he says, "an additional small gunboats sent to remain near the draw-bridge," that he may look after the threatened raid in other directions. You will oblige me if you can comply with his request. The secessionists in Norfolk have been in high spirits for several days, and we hear in many quarters that some movement against us is intended.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

UNITED STATES FLAG-SHIP MINNESOTA,

Newport News, January 16, 1863.

Major General JOHN A. DIX:

GENERAL: I have sent another gunboat to Norfolk and have no additional gunboat to spare for that or any other purpose.

Respectfully, yours,

S. P. LEE,

Acting Rear-Admiral, &amp;c.

SUFFOLK, VA., January 16, 1863.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

A severe storm of wind and rain has continued from last night and little can be done of any variety of work. Parties of cavalry are out on all the avenues of approach. Nothing has been reported since my last telegram. General Viele advised of rumors prevailing there of raids upon the railway and I sent out a party on the track last night.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

SUFFOLK, VA., January 16, 1863.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe:

The guerrillas attacked the pickets about 4.30 p. m., wounding 2. They were driven some miles and dispersed. I do not think they will repeat the experiment. Doubtless they acted under instructions from Pryor. Pryor moved away and we do not know his position; supposed to be near Holly Neck Church. We captured two of his men, of the Fiftieth Virginia. He has several old regiments from Northwestern Virginia.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
