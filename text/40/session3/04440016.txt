APPEMDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[December 1,
Ho. op Reps.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
40th Cong....3d
shall so prevail as to give direction to the action
of tbe Government, he would feel that a very
great error had been committed, which could
hardly fail to be a severe misfortune to the
country. The people of the United States will
never be so willing' to be taxed for the purpose
of reducing the debt as at the present time.
Now the necessity for its creation -is better
understood and appreciated than it can be at
a future day. Now it is regarded by a large
majority of tax-payers as a part of the great
price paid for the maintenance of the Govern-
ment, and therefore a sacred debt. The longer
the reduction of it is postponed the greater
will be the difficulties in the way of accomplish-
ing it, and the more intolerable will seem to
be the burden of taxation. The Secretary,
therefore, renews the recommendations made
in his first report, that, a certain definite sum
be annually applied to the payment of the in-
terest and the principal of the debt. The amount
suggested was $200,000,000. As tbe debt is
considerably smaller than its maximum was
estimated at, the amount to be so applied annu-
ally might now safely be fixed at§175,000,000,
according to the estimate already made in this
report.
The subject of the currency in which the
five-twenty bonds may be paid—agitated for
some time past—was freely discussed during the
recent political canvass, and made a ques-
tion upon which parties, to some extent, were
divided. The premature and unfortunate agi-
tation and discussion of this question have been
damaging to the credit of the Government,
both at home and abroad, by exciting appre-
hensions that the good faith of the nation
might not be maintained, and have thus pre-
vented our bonds from advancing in price, as
they otherwise would have advanced, after it
was perceived that the maximum of the debt
had been reached, and have rendered funding
at a low rate of interest too unpromising to be
undertaken. In his report in 1865 the Secre-
tary used the following language:
" Before concluding his remarks upon the national
debt, the Secretary would suggest that the credit of
the five-twenty bonds, issued utfder the acts of Feb-
ruary 25,1862, and June 30,1864, would be improved
in Europe, and, consequently, their market value
advanced at home, if Congress should declare that
the principal as well as the interest of these bonds is
to be paid in coin. The policy of the Government in
regard to its funded debt is well understood in the
United States, but the absence of a provision in these
acts that the principal of the bonds issued under
them should bo paid in coin, while such a provision
is contained in the act under which the ten-forties
wore issued, has created some apprehension in Eu-
rope that the five-twenty bonds might becalled in at
the expiration of five years, and paid in United States
notes. Although it is not desirable that our securi-
ties should be held out of the United States, it is de-
sirable that they should be of good credit in foreign
markets on account of the influence which these mar-
kets exert upon our own. It is, therefore, important
that all misapprehensions on these points should be
removed by an explicit declaration of Congress that
these bonds are to be paid in coin."
Without intending to criticise the inaction
of Congress in regard to a matter of so great
importance, the Secretary does not hesitate to
say that if his recommendations had been
adopted the public debt would have been much
less than it is; and that the reduction of the
rate of interest would ere this have been in
rapid progress. The Secretary does not think
it necessary to discuss the question in this re-
port. His opinions upon it are well known to
Congress and the people. They were definitely
presented in his report for 1867, and they re-
i.iain unchanged. He begs leave merely to
suggest, as he has substantially done before,
that alleviation of the burden of the public
debt is to be obtained not in a decrial of the
national credit, not in threats of repudiation,
not in a further issue of irredeemable notes,
not in arguments addressed to the fears of the
bondholders, but in a clear and explicit dec-
laration by Congress that the national faith,
in letter and spirit, shall be inviolably main-
tained ; that the bonds of the United States,
intended to be negotiated abroad as well as at
home, are to be paid, when the time of pay-
ment arrives, in that currency which is alone
recognized as money in the dealings of nation
with nation. Let Congress say.this promptly,
and there can be but little doubt that the credit
of the Government will so advance that within
the next two years the interest on the larger
portion of the debt can be reduced to a satis-
factory rate. He therefore earnestly recom-
mends that it be declared without delay, by
joint resolution, that the principal of all bonds
of the United States is to be paid in coin. .
■ It is also -recommended that the Secretary
be authorized to issue $500,000,000 of bonds,
$50,000,000 of which shall mature annually ;
the first.$50,000,000 to be payable, principal
and interest, in lawful money—the principal
and interest of the rest in coin; and also such
further amount of bonds as may be necessary
to take up the outstanding six per cents, and
the non-interest bearing debt, payable in coin
thirty years after date, and redeemable at any
time after ten years at the pleasure of the Gov-
ernment—the interest to be paid semi-annually
in coin, and in no case to exceed the rate of
five per cent.; provided that the Secretary may,
in his discretion, make'the principal and inter-
est of $500,000,000 of these bonds payable at
such city or cities in Europe as he may deem
best.
The fact that, according to the recommenda-
tion, $50,000,000 of the bonds to be issued are
tobecome due each year for ten consecutive
years (at the expiration of which time all of
the bonds would be under the control of the
Government) would insure an annual reduc-
tion of $50,000,000 of the public debt, and
impart a credit to the other bonds which would
insure the negotiation of them on favorable
terms.
Of the expediency of an issue of bonds cor-
responding to some extent in amount with
those held in Europe, the interest and princi-
pal of which shall be paid in the' countries
where they are to be negotiated, there can be
but little doubt. On this point the Secretary
used the following language in his report of
1866:
11 The question now to he considered is not how
shall our bonds kre prevented from going abroad—for
a largo amount has already gone, and others will
follow as long as our credit is good and we continue
to buy more than we can pay for in any other way—
but how shall they be prevented from being thrown
upon the home market to thwart our efforts in restor-
ing thespecie standard 1 The Secretary sees no prac-
ticable method of doing this at an early day, but by
substituting for them bonds which, being payable
principal and interest in Europe, will be less likely
to be returned when their return is the least to be
desired. The holders of our securities in ffiurope are
now subject to great inconvenience and not a little
expense in collecting their coupons; and it is sup-
posed that five per cent., or perhaps four and a half
per cent, bonds, payable in London or Frankfort,
could be substituted for our six per cents, without
any other .expense to the United States than the tri-
fling commissions to the agents through whom the
exchanges might be made. The saving of interest to
be thus effected would be no inconsiderable item;
and the advantages of having our bonds in Europe
placed in the bands of actual investors is too im-
portant to be disregarded."
The Secretary has nothing further to say on
this point than that careful reflection has only
strengthened his convictions of the correctness
of the views expressedln the foregoing extract.
In recommending the issue of bonds bearing
a lower rate of interest, to be exchanged for
the outstanding six per cents., the Secretary
must not be understood as having changed his
opinion in regard to the expediency or the wis-
dom of the recommendation in his last report:
" That the act of March 3,1865, be so amended as
to authorize the Secretary of the Treasury to issue
six per cent, gold-bearing bonds, to be known as
the consolidated debt of the United States, having
twenty years to run, and redeemable, if it may be
thought advisable, at an earlierday, to be exchanged
at par for any and all other obligations of the Gov-
ernment, one sixth part of the interest on which, in
lieu of all other taxes, at each semi-annual pay-
ment, shall he reserved by the Government, and
paid over to the States according to population."
He refers to what he then said in advocacy
of that recommendation as an expression of
liis well-considered opinions at the present
time, and he is only prevented from repeating
the recommendation by the fact that it met
with little approval at the last session, and has
not grown into favor since. He sincerely hopes
that the future history of the debt will vindi-
cate the wisdom of those who are unable to
approve the proposition.
