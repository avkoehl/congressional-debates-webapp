Major General G. H. THOMAS:

One of my aides has just returned from the rear and reports the gap so blockade up with wagons that it is probable General Davis' division will not reach here until morning. I have sent for my supply trains, and they will be here to-morrow during the forenoon.

[General HOOKER:]

General Kilpatrick is out on the Resaca road about four miles, very near the junction with the Lay's Ferry and Dalton road; quite a sharp skirmishing. The general sent a brigade of cavalry out on the road from Sugar Valley to Dalton; just received news from it; the enemy's pickets were driven in for four miles, when the rebels showed quite a strong force.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. W. ASMUSSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
