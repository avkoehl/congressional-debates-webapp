Brigadier-General VAUGHN:

I am unable to take command to-day. Assume it, withdraw the trains to a safe position, place the troops in position on the range of hills immediately around the city, embracing College Hill. Confer with General D. H. Hill (who has kindly consented to assist)in regard to position of troops and artillery, and require the cavalry to resist advance of enemy, and then take position to protect our flanks. General Hill will be found at Cemetery Hill, or at Mr. McDaniel's. Bring your wagons in at once.

JNO. C. BRECKINRIDGE,

Major-General.

PRIVATE.-There is no occasion for any disorder. The enemy is advancing slowly. We will have General Early and large re-enforcements to-morrow morning, and if enemy comes in earnest he will be destroyed.

General BRAGG:

You dispatch of this date received. No train has been lost, and General Ransom will arrive on the regular train this afternoon. I have some fear that enemy will not attack Lynchburg, but will move from New London toward Danville railroad. In view of it, all precautions in my power have been taken. General Early will arrive here about 1 p. m. to-day.
