Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

FORT MONROE, VA., June 4, 1865

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Can I go to Washington to consult you, General Grant, and the Quartermaster-General, in regard to the best method of promptly reducing expenses in this department, and carrying out General Grant's order to me to send home dispensable general and staff officers? For instance there are three independent chief quartermaster' establishments to do the same thing, except expending several hundred thousand dollars, whereas only one is necessary for this department, and I will discharge either two which the Quartermaster-General chooses. Then I have a district organization and an army organization. Can dispense with one, as you may direct, and discharge a number of staff officers and general officers. There are other points on which I wish to confer.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

Washington City, June 4, 1865.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Fortress Monroe:

You have permission to come to Washington for the purpose mentioned in your telegram.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

Secretary of War.
