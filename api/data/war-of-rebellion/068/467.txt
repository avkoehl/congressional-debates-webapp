Major-General SHERIDAN,Commanding Cavalry Corps:

Your dispatch of 11.45 a.m. received. General Hancock has been heavily pressed and his left turned. The major-general commanding thinks that you had better draw in your cavalry so as to secure the protection of the trains. The order requiring an escort for the wagons to-night has been rescinded.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch received. The trains are now moving to Ely's Ford. The trains of the Second Army Corps would not move without an escort, so I have sent 1,300 dismounted men to Ely's Ford with it. I have sent a regiment to scour the country to United States Ford and to watch the roads. United States Ford is not in a passable condition for cavalry or infantry without much labor; it is also quite deep. The enemy's cavalry again attacked me and were repulsed and driven, leaving their dead and wounded on the field. They are now working toward my left, and I have made new dispositions in accordance with orders received from the major-general commanding.

Major-General, Commanding.
