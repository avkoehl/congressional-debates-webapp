Mr BCNTON e\puc ed h hope f>?t Mr
OpiTTENDf ! wonl' i oi íasi t upon this, but would
accept, in  lieu of it, ihe amendment which had
been read by Mr Tappan
Mr CRITTENDEN declined doing so, as he
did not consider the latter as at all covering the
same ground.
Mr TAPPAN then formally moved his amend-
ment, which was to add to the first section a proviso,
in the following terms "Provided further, That no
person being th.. ownei of land m any State or
Teintory, who sha 1 quit or abandon his residence
on his own land, to reside on public land in the
same Sta e or Territory, shall acquire any right of
p'e emption under this act "
Mr. CLAY of A'abami hoped the friends of the
settler would vote agnnst both propositi  ns, on the
gr< und that it was entirely a new feature in the
tyslem, and on« wholly unnecessaiy, for who
would tLir k of making a speculation on 160 acres
