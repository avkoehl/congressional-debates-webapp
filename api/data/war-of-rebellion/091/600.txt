Brigadier General GEORGE H. GORDON, Chief of Staff:

SIR: I beg leave to forward two communications (applications of two officers to be mustered out; term expired), which explain themselves. At this moment I am starting for Whitehall (the quartermaster's pier), to see to the ration and forage business, and thence to visit the Peconic, Augusta, and George Law, when I will return to West Twenty-third street.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS PROVISIONAL DIVISION, & C.,New York Harbor, November 10, 1864 - 2 p. m.

Brigadier General GEORGE H. GORDON, Chief of Staff:

SIR: The master of the transport John Romer is here, representing that he has more troops than he can well accommodate, and that you said that if I thought it best another boat would be ordered up to take a portion of her men. It is no doubt true that the Romer is the most crowded of our transports, and that if they are to stay aboard another night, or if a rough westerly wind is to rise, it would be advisable to make some change. I therefore respectfully suggest that a light transport be sent up to take one regiment off the Romer and cruise in the same neighborhood. If the Romer is to be entirely relieved it will take a good sized steamer. The wants of the troops have been, or are being, attended to in all respects.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. R. HAWLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. R. HAWLEY,
