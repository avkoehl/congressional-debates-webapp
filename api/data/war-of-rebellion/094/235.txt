HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS, December 17, 1864.

Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: In the condition of the roads I think it certain that the trains will be so late getting up that it will be entirely impracticable to bring rations here from the Franklin pike. I would suggest that the quickest way will be for us to march to the place where the trains are in the morning, and halt there long enough to issue. If this is done, please give me the order of march as early as practicable.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DETACH. ARMY OF THE TENN., In the Field, near Nashville, Tenn., December 17, 1864.

ABRAHAM LINCOLN,President of the United States:

"Smith's guerrillas" again did a noble work yesterday, not the least portion of which is due to the First Division. I respectfully ask, as an act of justice and honor fairly won, that Colonel W. L. McMillen, Ninety-fifth Regiment Ohio Infantry Volunteers, Colonel L. F. Hubbard, Fifth Regiment Minnesota Infantry Volunteers, commanding the First and Second Brigades, respectively, be appointed brigadier-generals; also Colonel S. G. Hill, Thirty-fifth Regiment Iowa Infantry Volunteers, who commanded the Third Brigade, and was killed while gallantly charging the enemy's work, I would recommend to be gazetted a brigadier-general.

J. McARTHUR,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
