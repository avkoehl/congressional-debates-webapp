of commendation for their conduct during the bombardment and the assault.

The artillery behaved throughout the day with remarkable courage. Lieutenant-Colonel Simkins had a most severe duty to perform during the day, in directing the operations of the artillery. This, unflinchingly and admirably, he performed and, after the enemy's heavy guns had ceased, he mounted the parapet and encouraged the infantry. There, on the ramparts in the front, this admirable soldier and accomplished gentleman sealed his devotion to our cause by an early but most heroic death.

Captains Buckner and Dixon, Sixty-third Georgia, and Captain Adams, First South Carolina Infantry [Third Artillery], deserve especial mention; but I desire to bring most conspicuously to the notice of the brigadier-general commanding the name of Lieutenant [J. H.] Powe, whose coolness, skill, and gallantry were unsurpassed. I regret to say he was severely wounded.

I would also especially mention Lieutenant [T. D.] Waties, commanding the field pieces on the left of the work, who was conspicuous for his gallantry, and who was severely wounded; and the skill, coolness and gallantry of Captain De Pass, who assumed command of his pieces after his fall. These pieces rendered most important service.

I have doubtless omitted the names of many officers whose gallantry should be recorded, and shall in a subsequent report endeavor to do justice to all.

I must, in conclusion, mention the good conduct of Sergeant [John R.] Williams, of Lieutenant Powe's company, and Corporal Conneway, of Twenty-second Georgia Battalion, who greatly distinguished themselves.

To the officers of my personal staff, I am under obligations.

I lament to record the death of the gallant Captain [P. H.] Waring, acting aide-de-camp, and the wounding of Captain [H. D. D.] Twiggs, assistant inspector-general, and Captain [W. E.] Stoney, aide-de-camp, who were stricken down, nobly discharging their duty.

To Captain [W. T.] Taliaferro, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenants [E.] Mazyck and [H. C.] Cunningham, ordnance officers, and [Richard K.] Meade, aide-de-camp, and to Surgeon [J. C.] Habersham, Major [E. L.] Holcombe, and Captain [Thomas A.]

Burke, I tender my thanks for their aid, &amp;c., during the course of the week.

I would especially mention Captain [R. H.] Barnwell, of the Engineers.

The commands of Colonel [C. H.] Olmstead, Lieutenant-Colonel [H. D.] Capers, Major [G. M.] Hanvey, and Major [W. S.] Basinger; of Lieutenant-Colonel [P. H.] Nelson and Lieutenant-Colonel [O. M.] Dantzler; and the artillery, under the admirable management of Lieutenant-Colonel [Joseph A.] Yates, with such officers as Captains [J. R.] Mathewes and [C. E.] Chichester, deserve great credit for their bravery and zeal, in the early part of the week.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. B. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.

Captain [W. F.] NANCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
