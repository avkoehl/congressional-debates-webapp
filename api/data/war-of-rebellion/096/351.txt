LOUP CREEK, February 1, 1865.

Colonel J. H. OLEY,

Commanding, &amp;c., Charleston:

One of my scouts that came in to-night reports that citizens living near House Shoe say that Rosser's division and Echols' brigade are at Lewisburg. From all I can learn I think this report is correct. I do not think they have yet left Lewisburg. All is quiet toward Raleigh.

J. WHITLEY, JR.,

Captain, Commanding Post.

CHARLESTON, W. VA., February 1, 1865.

Captain J. WHITLEY,

Loup Creek:

Make every exertion to get reliable information. From other information that I have I can hardly believe that any large force is at Lewisburg. I heard some time since that some cavalry and artillery were expected in Greenbrier, Monroe, &c., to remain awhile on account of forage. Be on the alert. Take every precaution, and communicate freely to me. How far out have you had scouts to-day? Have you heard from Captain Ramsay?

JOHN H. OLEY,

Colonel, Commanding.

LOUP CREEK, February 1, 1865.

Colonel J. H. OLEY:

My scouts have just returned from Captain Mann's. The captain himself was out a scout. The sergeant in command reports that they positively know that two brigades of rebels are in Greenbrier County, one of cavalry and one of infantry. Four batteries were ordered to go to the Narrows of New River. I shall received further information form Captain Mann in the course of the day.

J. WHITLEY, JR.,

Captain, Commanding.

LOUP CREEK, February 1, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel J. S. PLANTER,

Commanding Camp Piatt:

I have information that a large rebel force is in Greenbrier Country. They declare that they intend to invade the Valley. I think form the large force which is reported that they will make work for us within a day or two.

J. WHITLEY, JR.,

Captain, Commanding Post.
