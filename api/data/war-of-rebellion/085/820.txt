can probably hold out against any guerrilla force that may attack you. If an overwhelming force of rebels march on you, you must be ready to evacuate and get away from them. Retire on Mexico or Sturgeon. The force at Fayette prudently withdrew to Macon the morning before the rebel force reached that post. we cannot defend the towns against a great army of Confederates, but I have no fears but that you can successfully defend against Anderson &amp; Co. I am glad to learn that the Honorable James S. Rollins is aiding you with his most excellent judgment and personal presence and energies. Keep me posted, if possible.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

CHILLICOTHE, October 12, 1864.

General CRAIG:

Scouts just in from Ray and Carroll line. All quiet in my south front. Carroll's scouts are active. I will in future hear from Carroll twice in every twenty-four hours. My scouts this morning are in the direction of Chariton as well as Carroll.

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT CHARLES, October 12, 1864 - 12.03 p. m.

General ROSECRANS:

If the force is sufficient at Macon City to protect your property and our cars, my judgment is that it will be safer there than en route back to Saint Charles. We have only one small engine there and cannot send more without a guard of, say, 150 drilled troops from this point. There is no engine or tranmen between Saint Charles and Macon, except two en route south from Mexico by your orders, and none can be got there, except sending them from here.

J. B. MOULTON,

Assistant Superintendent.
