TOÍNaGC, FREIGHTS, AND COMMERCE
T,ne following resolution, submitted by Mr  Woobbuuy on
theSOtii Maicb, came up foi conisi elation, viz
Ite^olved, 1 lidt the Committer on Commerce inquire into
thest ite oí our tonnage, heights, and commeice with foieun
powei^an 1 repon whether H is prospeious or otherwise uudei
the t-xi^tiag an&ngemcnt by treaties ot laws in relation thereto
And aloo whether the regulations by other Governments -\vp
equal ind ii\conioimity to the spiutof those arrangements,and
if not so, whit measures are proper to msirerecipiocuy
Mr WOODBURY observed, that when this subject came up
before, he had requested us postponement, lest the ditcut-sion
which might arise, should mteifore with pressing business
then in piogiess As the resolution wad now ealled up a^ain m
jt3 regular order and he knew of no pending business to lntei
mot it, he would make a few remarks in explanation of the
object he had m view
Mr W then catered into a historical sketch of the treaties
heretofoie existing with England and the other poweis of E a
rope, n oidt*r to show that the reciprocal arrangements had
been made by our most distinguished statesmen at Ghent, and
Since And he showed that the petitioners complained as to
colon al arc meement justly, not so much of the airiangements
themsi. Ives, as that anangements of reciprocal commeice m
respect to the British colonies, in parttculai, weie, on thui

demo colonial arrangement bur the high tariff, ovtr forty th m

30u 060 tons notwithstanding a descending tariff and imj ui ^
hati '"id1 for *ieveii >ears, uo U*ni ed States Bank, and above all
thp colonial arrangement
In Mame, also, u nder the period of the dow ufall of the Ban k,
the reduction of the tariff; and alleged misrule of the late Ad
ministration, the tonnage increased near 120 000 tons, or till it
nearly doubled that of the preceding ten years, while from 1820
to 1830 it increased only about 40,000 tons It has been said
lately in the Senate that Hie tonnage of Massachubet s, as well
as of Maine, had fallen off, but he showed from the t tbles that
id bath &taLes the tonnage had not only vastly increased within
the ten year3 fiom*lB30to 1840, but also the ship building So
remarkable was the increase of ship building m Maine with n
that peuod, that it hid risen, between 1830 and 1840,
from twelve to one hundred and six vessels, as large as
ships and brigs, oi, m 1810 more than hajf the number
of vessels of that siz" built m the who^ of the United Slate* m
lfe30 And these weie vessels not meiely of a hundred cr a
hundred and fifty tons, but of two oi three hundred, in some
casessixhundred tons, mothers, and in one case laiely, even
reaching to twelve hundrpd to s-a man of war in size He
then went into a sepaiate inquiry, and showed the difieien.ee
between tonnage clearing to loieign] orts and the amount tie
owned, which was registered for foreign trade It might
clear twice oi twenty times in one year, or only once in two oi
three years In the tables of tonnage, gio=s error* occurred,
without noticing this distinction The tables sho'cd ship
ments andreshipmeuts, and the tonnage of íepeated short voy
ages by the same vessels m the same yeai and not the quantity
actually owned engaged in foreign trade And the gieat fall icy
consisted m counting the tonnage of the tables as the quantity
of tonnage owned, as well asm supposing that the tonnage en
tenng and clearing might not be much ofttnei in a year and
look larger thus on one side than en the other, when the quan
tity really employed on the latter «ide was the largest Next
he showed how unreasonable it was to expect that the United
fetales should own the tonnage or canying trade of the whole
world All that we mrsht get in general was abroad, and we
at peace as formerly But now practically all that could be
hoped for was a fan competition and such advantages as could
be gained fiomsupenor skill, accommodation and energy in
competition with the vessels of less lavored nations These
very elements had alreuly enabled thus country to obtain a
greater portion of the carrvmg trade on the high s-ea^ to
and irom this country than England, but actually
greater, moie than double, a'l the rest of the world
with us put together Was not this enough to silence
all complaint on that head? He entered into many details to
show this A good deal had been said erioneously that the fo
reign tonnage m theSmthem ports of the U ittd totatcs, ex
ceeded the heme tonnags This he proved not only to b<> incoi
rect, but the reveise of thelict, the home tonnage befng now
actually three times that oi foteisrn tonnage m the pons of Sa
vdnnjh, Chai'eston,Mobile and ístw Orlean united Ihsdif
ference m favor ol Am itf in tonnage, had mereced fiom ¡820
to 1810, near one third of a million of tons inthat ten veais
He give numeiotis statistics on this, as to Ma=¡sachu ttt^and
Mámelas well as the teouth, which we cannot repeat heie
The tonnage of England in her roloiwal poises io'is in North
America, tiading wiin us on the Northland Northeast, is swell
ed by short voy iges o i the tot Lawienceand the I ik>s where
bhe has twenty steam boats for the five owi ed by the United
{states, and then trips are so ahoit and often repeated wuh but
little ft eight, that the quantity of tonnaee which they show m
the table , is from twenty to thn ty times counted ovei in a ye^r
by this repetitfor fcuch m i<xt is the way in which the dp
parent e,reHtontugc ol theCn^hsh colonies, tiat ins with u«i,
can be proved to be ia lactou , n wnhs "ndmg alltl at Mr M

that, even bv the lintish tables n could be pm\e 1 tint ihe car
rytng tiadeof the United Mates with Í Fiand alone, --in e 1815,
had reached over three bundled at d eighty eight thousand l ns
while that of England pi opcr hil only i cached one hut died
and ninety two thousand tons and a taction But there was a
real increase of American over British tonnage in the tiade to
the West India I lands much beyond any loss of ours to and
w ith the neutral islands betore and since 18^0 Next, he showed,
that the appaient increaseof Buush tonnage toothei quaiten,
was not real, being merely the result of reshipme its and le en
tries—letouchmg at different pot sin the same\nyage He
went next to the pi ogress of our commerce since this colonial
arrangement Thus all the expor s of the United totales in 1820
were sixty nine millions and aftaction, in 1830, seventy thiee
millions—an motease of only four millions—in 1840, one hun
dred and thirty two millions—an excess of near ?my millions in
stead ol only four or five The expons to England, Scotland,
and Iieland ofdt mesne oi gin, wtie, m 1820 twenty ei ht mil
hens^m 1830, o\erthnty one million*, and in 18'0 overseventy
millions He showed hattheie was a great fallacy, aKo m
supposmir England did not take the bread s uffs ol the United
I States in ex hanae for imports, because an immense quantity
3 (bread stufiafiom the United St ilea go into the British c< To
mes, and thence get mt > England m spite of Bt uioh coi n 1 iv,
and at a lower duty Thi-a he pioved by facts, showing the vast
inciea e of the exports oí bread stuiTsmto the British colon e&
The^e bread stuff-j fed the nnms, navi^t,, \ rovince5? an 1 then

that the speech of the Senatoi from New Hampshne embrac*

Mr HUNTINGION made^ome jb&ervations witha view of
calling die attention of the Senator from New Hampshire to
some panic uUrs which he ha J not touched up 3D, cothat when
tltt subject came up again, he might offer such explanation as
he should think called for

Was it not a i enod when ti e labor of the country and home in-
