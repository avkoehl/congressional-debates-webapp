CAMP DOUGLAS, Chicago, Ill., October 31, 1863.

SIR: Agreeable to your order to Colonel De Land, I submit the report of hospital fund of prisoners of war and its expenditure for month of September, 1863, at Camp Douglas, Chicago, Ill.

The rations are furnished on contract by E. S. Fowler &amp; Co., which provides when rations are commuted it shall be at 14 8/100 cents for each and every ration. The contract also provides that the component parts of each ration shall have a certain price per pound, and 100 rations (per pound) at contract prices amount to more than commutation price, as the subjoined table of rations will show, which is contract price and nearly the proportion and kind of articles required in the hospital, and, as you will observe, lessens the savings to the hospital; hence leaves a small fund. The average number of sick for the month was 107 and the whole number of rations due was 3,235. See monthly statement of the hospital fund, which will give the issue, savings, and purchases for the month.

The following is a table of rations drawn by hospital, viz:

100 rations meat:

70 rations beef, 87 1/2 pounds, at 6 1/2 cents. . . rations pork, 22 1/2 pounds, at 4 8/4 cents. . . . . . 1 07

Total cost of 100 rations to hospital. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 18 42

Loss on 100 rations to hospital fund. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4 34

September. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 140 40

The above exhibit will show why it is that the hospital savings at this post must be small in proportion to the sickness when compared with other hospitals. The sickness during the present month is very much increased over last and of a severer type, which will increase the savings of the present month.

Trusting that the above is a satisfactory exhibit of the prisoners' hospital fund at Camp Douglas.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. F. WHELAN,

First Michigan Sharpshooters, Post Surgeon.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, November 3, 1863.

Colonel J. HOLT, Judge-Advocate-General U. S. Army:

COLONEL: Captain Frank B. Gurley, a Confederate soldier, was taken prisoner in the recent occupation of Lookout Valley by General Hooker.
