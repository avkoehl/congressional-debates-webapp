There is heavy skirmishing in front. We are still advancing. If some of those gun-boats could be sent up they would give us great advantage, event without firing a gun. I am about 6 miles, and our advance fully 7, from the ground we occupied this morning.

Brigadier General WILLIAM DWIGHT,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy is reported in position his right resting on the river and his left on the lake or marsh, between Wilson's Landing and this place. In the mean time Captain Hinkle, commanding my rear battery, reports that he is attacked. I have detached infantry to support him. I think it proper to advise the general commanding of his and to ask to close on my rear before I order the attack in front.
