lands.
Gentlemen, in their earnest efforts to secure
congressional aid for the industries of their own
section, seem to overlook the great industry of
this country, surpassing in results and numbers
engaged all others. Not disparaging any other
employment, I desire to urge that the agricul-
turists and the agricultural States of the Union
are deserving of the like consideration that is
claimed for miners or manufacturers.
West of the Ohio river and north of its mouth
dwell one third of the present population of
the Union; within this area ten States contain
over 12,000,000 of industrious, intelligent peo-
ple ; a soil of surpassing fertility yields a sur-
plus, yearlyincreasing, of agricultural produce.
Millions of bushels of wheat, corn, and oats
and vast quantities of beef, pork, and other food
must go to other States and other countries for
consumers. _ The farmers of that region have
invested their frugal earnings in the lands upon
which they reside. They have paid the Gov-
ernment for the right to possess and cultivate
them ; their capital consists of their farm and
improvements, with their implements and
stock ; whether profitable or unprofitable they
cannot abandon their.homes or allow their
fields to lie waste ; they accept less compensa-
tion for their labor and theuse of their capital,
and hope to reduce the cost of production in
succeeding years or obtain a better yield and
a better price.
Chief among these States having a common
interest from contiguity of territory and simi-
lar production is my own State of Illinois. If
there is an agricultural State in the Union
she can claim the appellation. In 1868 her
production of corn was 134,360,000 bushels;
of wheat, 28,560,000 bushels, being nearly one
seventh of the whole product of the United
States for that year. Besides this she exported
large quantities of beef, pork, seeds, and other
farm products.
The Commissioner of Agriculture estimated
from returns to his Department the total amount
of wheat grown in the United States in the year
1868 at 224,000,000 bushels; of this probably
32,000,000 were used for seed for the succeed-
ing crop, and the custom-house returns show
that our exports of ivheat and flour above
imports for the fiscal year 1868-69 equaled
28,000,000 bushels. This leaves 164,000,000
for consumption in the United States, or about
4} bushels per capita,, estimating the popula-
tion for the year 1868 at 38,500,000.
Let us inquire where is this raised, and what
States have an excess, and what a deficiency.
The following table taken from the report of
the Commissioner of Agriculture as to amount
raised in each State, basing the population
upon estimates made and published by Edward
Young, esq., of the Statistical Bureau, shows
the amount of wheat raised and exported in
the grain-producing States and necessary to be
imported for consumption by the other north-
ern States:

- The northwestern agricultural States pro-
duced 188,000,000 bushels of wheat and a sur-
plus, by this estimate, of 74,000,000. But
allowing that consumption of a product is
greatest where produced, and that the northern
States consume more and the southern States
less than this proportion, the northwestern
il States export beyond their own borders at least
| 65,000,000 bushels of wheat in flour and wheat,
h -Llie same States in the year 1868 also Droduopd
400,000,000 bushels of corn, a large part of
which was exported in kind or in their shipments
of cattle, hogs, beef, and pork.
Where is found the market for this surplus?
Pennsylvania will take perhaps 4,000,000 bush-
els. Her farmers can furnish almost sufficient
for the laborers in her mines and factories.
Fifteen million bushels of wheat constitute the
home production of that State. New York, the
prosperity and business of whose railroads,
canals, and commercial cities are identified with'
the development of the agricultural resources of
the western States, needs but 14,000,000 above
what her own grain-fields supply. New Eng-
land is content with the purchase of 15,000,-
000bushels, leaving31,000,000 bushels to seek
a market in the southern States and foreign
countries. The latterpurchased of us 28,000,000
bushels; almost as much as we could induce the
manufacturing regions of the United States to
buy. The balance of the wheat and flour must
go abroad, and the price abroad will govern
the price both at home and abroad. This
seems to'be admitted by every gentleman who
has advocated or opposed the increase or con-
tinuance of the present high duties. In an able
argument for protective duties the cost of trans-
porting wheat from the vicinity of Chicago to
Liverpool was given as follows:
Putting a bushel of red winter wheat at SI 30(nine
shillings per one hundred pounds,) its price in Liv-
erpool on Christmas eve, 1869, we find its value in
gold to the western farmer by the following deduc-
tions:
Carriage from Chicago to New York  30
Marino freight  10

Equal in gold to 151- cents.
Total deduction from price in Liverpool, 09 ecru-;
leaving to the farmer 61 cents in gold—73 cents cur-
rency—per bushel.
The distinguished gentleman from Michigan
[Mr. Blair] adds:
" This shows that wheat is now worth 73 cents at
Chicago lor export. Let the farmers consider this
table."
The farmers are considering the facts and
reply, "Let Congress consider this table." Is
there no relief but to increase the cost to the
farmer of production and transportation, so as
to break down his business and drive him to
engage in more favored industries? With the
highest tariff ever enacted in this or any other
country, the surplus grain product increasing
and price diminishing, can Representatives see
no way to aid the farmer but to increase still
higher the cost of the articles he must neces-
sarily use ? Will not the reduction of the cost of
iron, steel, salt, and other commodities, ofwhich
he js the greatest consumer, reduce in greater
ratio the cost of raising grain and stock, and aid
instead of depressing his industry ?
The price of wheat at railroad stations and
towns from 100 to 150 miles from Chicago varies
at the present time from 60to 70 centsper bushel.
ihe farmer is notrcceivingmore than about
(10 cents per bushel for No. 1 wheat in Illinois,
and this tor the best quality of spring wheat.
_ Ihe low price of wheat abroad is the result
m part of increased facilities of transporta-
tion. Causes which are to some extent per-
manent will keep the price of wheat low.
_ Ihe total population of the people border-
ing 011 the Mediterranean is 180,000,000. A
well-mformed writer says:
Into that sea and its tributaries empty thelargc-si
rivers ot iiurope and Egypt—rivers that peneirnt'?

factures can produce, and inhabited by people wlio
require all the articles of commerce usually taken
by civilized and refined countries.
