HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, August 2, 1864-9 p. m.

General S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General:

There has not been much firing on my front to-day, though it is now quite brisk. The following observations are reported by Colonel Humphrey, commanding Second Brigade, Third Division: The enemy shows great activity in strengthening their old and throwing up new works. The redoubt on Cemetery Hill appears completed, and arranged for five or six guns. A considerable work was done in smoothing down the ruins of the redoubt destroyed on the 30th, and a work, I think to be used as a covered way, leading from the ravine on the left (enemy's left) diagonally across the field to this redoubt has been thrown out. A heavy fatigue party has also been at work during the day in front of the right of the line occupied by the Fifth Corps, in a ravine running parallel with the enemy's main line, and between it and his picket-line. A considerable quantity of lumber has been carried to this party to-day. I have also observed more smoke from what appeared to be the enemy's camp-fires than for some time past. These fires were well to the rear of that part of the enemy's line in front of the Fifth Corps. In the reported construction of new works between the picket and main line both scantling and boards were seen.
