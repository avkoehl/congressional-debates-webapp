HUNTSVILLE, September 14, 1864.

Major B. H. POLK,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Granger directs me to say that I have information from Whitesburg that Roddey, with 1,000 men, camped last night twelve miles from there, on opposite side of the river, intending to cross the river at some point near Guntersville. A scout of seventy-five men has been sent to Claysville and the gun-boat to patrol the river near this neighborhood.

WM. P. LYON,

Colonel, Commanding Thirteenth Wisconsin.

DECATUR, ALA., September 14, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am informed that Wheeler and Roddey [are] at Cheatham's, below Florence, with a force about 6,000, with large train, &amp;c. The common rumor of their camp that they intend to return to Middle Tennessee; also that General Smith has gone back to Memphis, and that his infantry has been sent to Potomac and cavalry to Missouri. this is telegraphed to me by General Starkweather as the report of one of our men who was prisoner at that point and encamped. This will leave Forrest at liberty to join Wheeler. Is he not likely to make this combination? If not objectionable, please inform me if Smith has returned to Memphis.
