THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 13,
four prime articles of the consumption of civ-
ilized man, forming subjects of the largest
commercial transactions of the world, and the
sources of vast individual and national wealth.
There was no labor on this continent fit and
adequate to produce those great articles, in any
degree approximating the needs of the country
and the world, until the African negro was
brought to their production; and as he was
an untutored savage it was a necessity to bring
bim as a slave, and to hold him and his chil-
dren to involuntary slavery to get the labor
required for those great fields of the low lati-
tudes. Here, in this quarter of the world, no
substitute for negro labor in those productions
has yet been found, and there is no promise
that it ever will be found.
The northern colonies and States were not
favorable by climate and soil to make slave
labor profitable ; the South was eminently so
in both respects, and the consequence was that
the northern Statesbecame commercial chiefly,
the southern planting, growing cotton, sugar,
rice, indigo, and tobacco. The necessity of the
latter States was laborers from Africa; the
business of the former was commerce, and
they entered eagerly into the slave trade as
giving the largest profits, and sent their ships
to Africa and purchased negroes who had been
taken prisoners in war, or kidnapped, and
transported them to the southern States and
colonies, and sold them into slavery.
As events moved on the African slave trade
was made piracy and suppressed by the United
States, and the slaves were no longer the ori-
ginal stock of foreign-born, ignorant barba-
rians, somewhat ameliorated in their enslaved
condition by contact with white masters and
overseers, but they were the children and chil-
dren's children of that first stock "to the man-
ner born," in the midst of a Christian people,
possessed of a considerable degree of civiliza-
tion and intelligence, many of them professing
and living up to the Christian religion, and
generally docile, gentle, and faithful to their
owners, the white and black members of the
iamily living together in a patriarchal state.
The maintenance of slavery in this country
throughout theeighteenth century, when slaves
were mostly heathens and savages, and from
ten to five fold less in number, was a much
easier task than it come to be in this nine-
teenth century, when the opposing forces of
their augmented numbers, civilization, and in-
telligence, had become so powerfully reen-
forced by the advancing sentiment of the world
toward its utter reprobation. The conflict
between its assailants and supporters con-
stantly becoming fiercer and more extended,
it was apparent to calm and intelligent ob-
servers more than half a century ago, that this
institution, founded in force, wrong, and op-
pression, could not long be sustained, and the
slave States should then have broken the force
of its impending fall by organizing systems of
gradual emancipation. But passion and in-
terest prevented them from realizing the great
necessity. The States that assaulted their
property rights in slaves, had brought them
within their borders and had been chiefly the
vendors of human flesh to them for gold ; and
that those States should be making strenuous
efforts to wrest that property from them in
defiance of the guarantees of the Constitution
and without compensation justly excited their
extreme resentment.
The slave States, previous to 1860, had always
possessed a large influence in the administra-
tion of the Government of the United States,
and this was their security against the aggres-
sion of the free States upon their slave prop-
erty ; they had been most fully and distinctly
informed by the free States, that whenever they
got the uncontrolled possession of the United
States Government, all its great powers would
be perverted to rob them of four million slaves,
worth, by the modes of estimating all property,
$2,000,000,000. It is true, thl abolitionists
sought to obtain possession of the Government
partly for its offices and emoluments, but that
was a secondary object; the paramount one
was to abolish slavery; so the primary, the
great purpose of the southern States to hold
a commanding control of the United States
Government, was the protection and security
of their slave property, they well knowing that
this was the only labor to cultivate their exten-
sive, fertile lands and to produce their great
staples, and that the value of those lands, their
incomes, and the individual and aggregate
wealth of their country were dependent upon
their ability to control and command that la-
bor. Such was the principal and great stake
which the southern States had in the grand
game for political power which the northern
abolitionists had so long and so fiercely waged
with them, and which they finally and utterly
lost in the great political campaign of 1860.
If there had been no crusade by the north-
ern States and people against the slavery of
the southern States, the people of the latter
States would never have thought of much less
have attempted secession ; and after their sig-
nal overthrow in the elections of I860, by which
the power of the General Government passed
forever from their hands to the northern abo-
litionists, and which they regarded as the pre-
cursor of the liberation of their slaves by un-
authorized power, they attempted to avert that
consequence by secession. The possession of
the Government and its powers, offices, and
emoluments, was certainly an immediate and
great object with them, but was regarded by
them as the only means by which their slave
property could be preserved, if they continued
in the Union; and when it was finally lost, the
South resorted to secession as their last hope
to perpetuate that property.
This movement combined and precipitated
against them two great forces, the fixed enmity
of a large portion of the American people to
slavery and the deep and fervid attachment
of a much larger portion to the Union ; and as
the struggle progressed, these forces became
augmented and intensified, and at length bore
down all resistance.
The least that can be said of secession is
that it was a deplorable mistake. The southern
States and people should have made timely
preparation for the inevitable event, but hav-
ing omitted that, should have asserted their
rights under the Constitution and within the
Union.
The Republican party, like the Democratic
party in 1860, is now in power, its popularity
and strength on the wane, with clear indica-
tions that the people have already decided to
take the Government out of their hands; and
they are wholly unwilling to surrender it to the
order of those to whom it belongs. But in
other respects there is essential difference in
the position of the two parties. The property
and material prosperity of the southern States
were threatened with impending destruction;
and it was to save these that they strove to
cling on to the possession of the Government,
that they inaugurated secession, revolution,
peaceable as they hoped, and which they had
so much reason in that form to desire. But
the sole object of the party in power is the Gov-
ernment, the offices and emoluments, the spoils
and plunder; and such has been the paramount,
the absorbing end for which they have admin-
istered it from the day they took possession to
the present time.
It is the highest duty of every party to which
the people intrust their Government to place
in its offices their best men, and to administer
it in conformity to the Constitution, upon just
principles, and for the good of the whole coun-
try. It was the wish of every patriot, of the great
mass of the American people, that the Repub-
lican party with their best men should so ad-
minister the Government; and had it realized
that hope it would have had a legitimate claim
to the confidence of the country, might have
secured the continuance of its trust, and no
good man would have had sufficient cause to
regret its retention in power upon that con'
dition.
But all its leading measures have been devices
in flagrant derogation of the Constitution, out-
rages upon the liberties and rights of the south-
ern people, and the subversion of their gov-
ernments and the substitution of military des-
potisms to enable it to hold on to power. Its
general policy since the rebellion was sup-
pressed, in 1865, has been a greater mistake, a
greater crime than even secession ; and the
passage of the bill under consideration would
be the continuance, the repetition, a great aug-
mentation of that mistake, that crime. It is
entitled "An act to enforce the provisions of
the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution
of the United States, and for other purposes."
A truer title would be "An act to authorize the
President of the United States to take military
possession of any or all the States, to suspend
the writ of habeas corpus, and establish mar-
tial law therein, and to supervise, control, and
direct the administration of their governments
and laws for his own reelecRon and for the
continuance in power of his party." To enforce
the fourteenth amendment to the Constitution
of the United States is the shallowest pretext
for introducing this bill, and I propose now to
attempt to make good this position.
Its third section provides, thatâ€”
In all cases where insurrection, domestic violence,
unlawful combinations, or conspiracies in any State
shall so far obstruct or hinder the execution of tho
laws thereof and of the United States as to deprive
any portion or class of the people of such State of
any of the rights, privileges, or immunities named
in and secured by this act, and the constituted au-
thorities of such State shall either be unable to, or
shall, from any cause, fail in or refuse protection of
the people in such rights, and shall fail or neglect,
through the proper authorities, to apply to the
President of the United States for aid in that behalf,
such acts shall be deemed a denial by such State of
the equal protection of the laws to which tbey are
entitled under the fourteenth articles of amend-
ments to the Constitution of the United Srates;
and in all such eases it shall be lawful for the Presi-
dent, and it shall be his duty, to take such measures,
by the employment of the militia or the land and
or naval forces of the United States, or of either,
or by other means, ashemay deem necessary for the
suppression of such insurrection, domestic violence,
or combinations, &c.
Section four says:
That whenever in any State or part of a State
the unlawful combinations named in the preceding
section of this act shall be organized and armed,
and so numerous and powerful as to be able, by vio-
lence, to either overthrow or set at defiance tho con-
stituted authorities of such State, or wben the con-
stituted authorities are in complicity with or shall
connive at the unlawful purposes of such powerful
and armed combinations; and whenever, by reason
of either or all of the causes aforesaid, the convic-
tion of such offenders and the preservation of the
public safety shall become in such district impracti-
cable, in every such oase such combination shall be
deemed a rebellion against the Government of the
United States, and during the continuance of such
rebellion, and within the limits of the district which
shall be so under the sway thereof, such limits to
be prescribed by proclamation, it shall jbe lawful for
the President of the United States, when in his judg-
ment the public safety shall require it, to suspend
the privileges of the writ of habeas corpus, &o.
Those sections, and the whole bill, are studi-
ously verbose and vague, and some swelling
language is used for effect. But by the third
section, for three or four men riding up to a
railroad station in Kentucky, one of them being
armed with a pistol, which was taken from him,
and he afterward making an ineffectual attempt
to drag the black mail agent from the car, it
would authorize the President to march into
that State any number of the " militia, or the
land or naval forces of the United States," and
employ them, or any other means he might
deem necessary, according to his discretion ;
and by the fourth section the same affair is also
to be deemed a rebellion against the United
States, and to authorize the President to pro-
claim martial law, suspend the writ of habeas
corpus, and establish a military despotism in
that State, to continue at his pleasure.
That this and similar offenses against tlio
laws of the United States, or the States, should
be proposed by a bill introduced into the two
Houses of Congress to be made a cause for
investing the President with such tremendous
