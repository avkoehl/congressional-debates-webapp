HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE EAST, New York City, July 17, 1863.

Brigadier-General CANBY, Commanding the City:

GENERAL: I understand that you hove ordered a regiment to Union Square. I think you had better send it to Madison Square. The position of Union Square is too far from the meeting. Brigadier-General Kilpatrick says that he ought to have some artillery. He will present this note to you, and will confer with you on the subject presented. I am apprehensive that we may have trouble this evening. If proper measures are adopted and carried out, we will have no trouble to-morrow. I have great confidence in the gallant General Kilpatrick. Very respectfully, your obedient servant,JOHN E. WOOL,

Major-General.

Numbers 2. Reports of Mr. Edward S. Sanford, U. S. Military Telegraph Service.

SIR: What is represented as a serious riot is now taking place on Third avenue, at the provost-marshal`s office. The office is said to have been burned, and the adjoining block to be no fire. Our wires in that direction have all been torn down. A report just in says the regulars from Governor`s Island have been ordered to the vicinity.

Respectfully,

E. S. SANFORD.

Honorable E. M. STANTON.

NEW YORK, July 13, 1863. (Received 2. 30 p. m.)

SIR: The riot has assumed serious proportions, and is entirely beyond the control of the police. Superintendent Kennedy is badly injured. So far the rioters have everything their own way. They are estimated at from 30, 000 to 40, 000. I am inclined to think from 2, 000 to 3, 000 are actually engaged. Appearances indicate an organized attempt to take advantage of the absence of military force.

Respectfully,

E. S. SANFORD. Honorable

E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War.
