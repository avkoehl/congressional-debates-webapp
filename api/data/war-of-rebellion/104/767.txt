HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Nashville, May 14, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER,Chattanooga:

When Governor Brown, of Georgia, and Jeff. Davis, Southern Confederacy, reach Chattanooga, a strong guard will be placed over the cars to prevent any communication whatever with the prisoners, except in case of sickness, when Surgeon Jones will attend them in person. Their meals, if they desire any from the hotel, must be taken by some trusty member of the guard which accompanied them from Georgia. They will be placed in a passenger car provided with privy arrangements, and sentinels so posted that none of the party can possibly escape, and they are to be treated with the utmost courtesy consistent with perfect security, and protected alike from insult and the annoyance of curiosity hunters. Telegraph me when they leave Chattanooga. Governor Brown will not be detained to await the arrival of Jeff. Davis, but will be forwarded by the first passenger train that leaves after his arrival. Jeff. Davis will be forwarded by a special train sufficient to accommodate the guard and prisoners only, and no person whatever will be allowed on the train except the guard and prisoners. Acknowledge receipt.

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
