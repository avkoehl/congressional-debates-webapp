COMMANDING OFFICERS FIFTH CORPS:

The commanding general considers it better taht you should not cross your train to-night. Wright's head of column is not up yet but will start as soon as it arrives, and as your train has begun to move it will be cut by his troops.

Major-General MEADE:

In my haste to send you some word during the row to-night I said "Longstreet' men", I should have said " Wilcox's men." I do not know if more attacked us.
