him, so I have returned here to move down to the White House, where he must come unless he goes to Gloucester. As soon as he takes transports I will move as you direct. There are some troops at White House, with a gun-boat, and I wish to attack them before Sheridan can get there. If he goes down this river in transports I think that I can damage him at Cumberland. I have directed Chambliss to join me to-day. Scouts report large number of transports loaded with troops going up Potomac toward Washington. My command is moving down beyond Hanover Court-House.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.

NEW MARKET, June 21, 1864-7.40 p. m.

(Via Chaffin's Bluff.)

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

If the two brigades ordered can be spared they had better come on, as I cannot ascertain the enemy's intentions. It is just reported that three or four regiments of cavalry are moving from Deep Bottom toward Cox's Landing to get in between us and Chaffin's. I doubt the report to its full extent, but, considering the nature of my command, I have thought it best to withdraw it behind the fortifications. Colonel Gary, with the assistance we can give him, will endeavor to hold New Market.*

Brigadier-General.

NEAR TUNSTALL'S STATION, June 21, 1864-8.30 a. m.

General R. E. LEE,

Commanding:

GENERAL: Sheridan crossed at Dunkirk yesterday morning and marched toward White House. He did not cross there, but I anticipate his doing so to-day. There are four regiments infantry-one negro-at White House; two batteries artillery, and two gun-boats. I drove most of the cavalry that was there and all the wagon train, which was a very large one, across the river with artillery yesterday, capturing a few prisoners, horses, &amp;c., but I did not assault the works because my force was not large enough to do so. I however occupied Cumberland Landing, cutting off the boats, and if a few troops can be sent here I think all the force at White House and the boats can be captured or destroyed. I shall take position, if Sheridan crosses, near Bottom's Bridge, so as to be near enough to attack if he attempts to march by me. He went as far down as Walkerton, and I then came across the Pamunkey to be ready to move to Petersburg as you had ordered. I could not remain longer so far from my supplies, and was thus forced to return. After I left, Sheridan marched back, and then crossed. He may wish to take transports at West Point. If he does take them I will at once move to Petersburg. At present I regard myself as carrying out your wishes best by keeping in front of Sheridan.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.
