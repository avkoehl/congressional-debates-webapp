Fitzhugh, Capehart, Stagg, and Pennington, brigade commanders; my staff, and every officer and man of the First and Third Cavalry Divisions, I return my sincere thanks for patriotic, unmurmuring, and soldierly conduct.

To Major H. H. Young, of my staff, chief of scouts, and the thirty or forty men of his command, who took their lives in their hands, cheerfully going wherever ordered, to obtain that great essential of success, information, I tender my gratitude. Ten of these men were lost.

Our entire loss during the march did not exceed 100 men, and some of these we left by the wayside, unable to bear the fatigues of the march.

This report should be regarded as the preface of my report of operations in front of Petersburg and Richmond, as my command only rested one day before its commencement.

I forward herewith list of prisoners captured and property destroyed.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

Bvt. Major General JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff, Washington, D. C.:
