EASTPORT, MISS., May 13, 1865.

(Via Johnsonville 15th.)

Major-General THOMAS:

Regiments of Roddey's and Forrest's command wish to surrender at Iuka and Corinth. Shall I parole them or send them to Meridian for this purpose? Most of the guerrilla bands of this vicinity are coming in. I have the telegraph wire up to Corinth this evening. The battery sent here is a light field, and I do not think will work toward Mobile far enough to make the connection.

Lieutenant-Colonel WISDOM,Nineteenth Tennessee Cavalry:

COLONEL: In reply to your request to make an arrangement for the surrender or your command, and the Confederate soldiers of McNairy County, Tenn., you can assemble your command and those soldiers at Corinth, Miss., for parole under the agreement of Major-General Thomas, commanding Department of the Cumberland, whose terms are the same as those agreed upon between Generals Lee, Johnston, and Taylor, and General Grant and Canby, and which I am instructed to carry out by the major-general commanding department. You can say to all irregular bands operating upon either the Confederate or Union side, without authority, they will be received upon the same terms, failing to accept which, they will be treated as outlaws. Rations will be furnished for your soldiers and irregular commands during the time required to consumate this arrangement. You will, on returning these men to their homes, say to them that they will be allowed to organize the civil authority of their country. Captain Rumple, of my staff, is designated as the proper officer to carry this agreement into effect.
