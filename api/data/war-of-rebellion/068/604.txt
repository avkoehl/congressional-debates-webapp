General HUMPHREYS:

When I returned last night I found that my picket-line, contrary to my positive order, came back again nearly to the position it held before in front of Crawford's division, and the firing we heard was caused by the enemy restoring theirs, I believe, as it was reported the command, "forward guide center" was distinctly heard. Some officer, I don't know who, said he saw the enemy when he was on the advanced position moving regiments to the east, but the statement is too confused to make much of. I had intended to thoroughly reconnoiter the enemy's position in person at daylight but this falling back prevented me. I have again ordered an advance.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 10, 1864-8.40 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I am pushing forward as promptly as possible. My left, which advanced first, is across the Alsop road. The enemy are entrenching in front of my left, and occupy rifle-pits in front of my center. I will determine very soon in what force.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 10, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

General Hancock has been ordered to throw out two divisions of his corps on your right, with which and your corps an attack on the enemy in your front will be made at 5 p. m. this day. You will accordingly make all necessary disposition. Major-General Hancock will by virtue of seniority have the command of the combined operations.

GEO. G. MEADE,
