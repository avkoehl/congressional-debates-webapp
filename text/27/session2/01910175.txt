peace. But how past was the difference between the last war
and that which was now to happen? The English party in the
neighborhood of New England would again raise the blue lights,
as they did then, to guide the enemy'  ñeet to oui shores But
now this party would make war, not to defend their own pro
perty, but to attack that of their countrymen At that day the
couDtiy had but seven mi hoi's oí inhabitants, yet the moral
and physical sueugth of the nation had pioved ¡sufficient to pu
down the blue light paiiy, who were disposed to sue foi peace
with the enemy And Mr W had no doubt but that their suc-
cessors would be defeated, dishonored and (h«graced as they
had been Ihe a,bohtn>nists and the dissolutions might
agaiii asbemble at llauford, and declare it against then reli-
gious sense of right to go towai with hngiand to defend slave
property, but their iate would be the tame as had miehgious
letnbutiun oveuaken their predecessors—tobe hated—-tobe
ever after suspected—to be omc a by word—and, he would not
eay, to be politically damned m the minds of all uuv nentad

Mr W said he had hitherto been speaking against the danger
of ioteign influence But, let it he remembered that the voice
of that Farewell Address, which Washington bequeathed as his
last legacy to his be'oveil country, warned us no less against tlie
dang^is oí sectional influence It wlined us against the rui-
nous consequences of ai raying the North agamst the South—the
East against the West Yet, what had we seen in the very

Washington had recommended, looked for, hoped for, lonsed
