be convenient to hive the bond and resignation arrive here
by the eatly part of September
I am, &c ,                             LEVI WOODBURY,
Secretary of the Treasury
G D  Boyd,                                                             *
Receiver of Public Money, Columbus, Mississippi
He permits him to tesign, and commends his
couise as " ftankandhonoiable1" Boyd is retail-
ing lands plundered from the people at an im-
mense profit—is making a fortune by his defalca-
tion—is permitted by the Secietary to stiutoff
with his " hands full," unscathed by a prosecu-
tion, he is elected an independent Locofoco Sena-
tor to the State Senate of Mississippi, and there
is a warm and grateful supporter of Mi Van Bu-
rén ' Well he may be' Such is his fate compared
with that of Tobias Watkms, to whom I would
beseech you again to go and buy soap to clean
yourselves. These are the crying abuses, sir,
the flagiant enormities, the damnable outrages
upon the public interests and morals, upon my
patience, which have so roused my spirit oft-
times, as to afford you and your party grounds
for representing me to be mad' Yes, sir, and I ap-
peal to every honest man if such monstrous abuses
are notenough to make the blood boil—to fienzy1
Would a pure Secretary ever have allowed Gar
esehS to address him as he did Woodbury' Did
not Garesché know that Woodbury was himself
corrupt, or would he, a subordinate, have dared to
address to him such reasons for retaining in pub-
lic trust such a faithless villain ' Would a Craw-
ford, or even a Rush, have been thus addressed >
Would a pure President retain such a Secietary,
who could unblushmgly report such appeals to
his dishonesty in an official communication > Sir,
Garesché concludes his report thus Speaking of
Harris, the predecessor of Boyd, he says
"Various are the reports of the late receiver's solvabil
ity, some say that he will piy the whole whilst oth rs,
and the greatest number, do not believe that he will pay
seventy five per cent, but the> all concede that his intem-
perance has been his greatest crime and that the loss oflns
money has been caused by that of his reason and th it, is
m algebra, the minus on one side has been made plus on the
other It is my belief that hi  forced confidence has been
sadly abused    He, too, passes for an honest man
tl I am, very respectfully, sir, your obedient servant, ,
"V m GAftEscrrc
" Hon Levi Woodbury, Secretary of the Treasury "
Why should not such a Secretary be impeached >
Impeach him, and I will go before that humbled
and disarmed Senate, and convict him out oflns
own mouth and the mouths of his own minions.
I will call no other witnesses. I will daie the
constitutional judges to acquit him—oveiawed as
they are by an arrogant Executive, they might
acquit him in the face of these facts, and in the
face of the people if they dare To read the
Swartwout report, one would think Woodbury
was astonished, astounded by a defalcation, yet
here are fifty cases of like character with those
of Linn, Harris, and Boyd.
It is worthy of remark that Garesché, in a sub-
sequent report, dated October 12, 1837, says
"I understand that Mr John Davis, of Columbus, has
applied for the office of receiver of public moneys, m the
room of G D Boyd, resigned I rom what I know of the
character of the postulant, I think it would be a very judi
cious choice, he has been brought up toihe bar, is amiable
and talented, and a warm friend of the Administration I
should be surprised if the Department suffered disappoint-
ment from that quarter "
No;"likely enough not to suffer from a warm
friend of the Administration, after the expeuence
of the two predecessois in that office '
But to pioceed. I will give you the case of the
" Receiver at Fort Wayne " To save time and
space, instead of reading all the letters and docu-
ments, I will give you, sir, the synopsis of this
case, as detailed by my fuend B Peyton, in his
testimony before the select committee of which I
was chairman, in 1837-
" I believe the Secretary of the Treasury has heen guilty
of a violation of official duty in retaining in office Colonel
John Spencer, receiver of public moneys m the land office
at Port Wayne, Indiana It appears, by a letter from the
Secretary of the Tre istirv, bearing date April 25,1836, in
his report to the House of Representatives of the 4th of
Sebruary instant, an extract ot which I herewith file, as a
part of my evidence, is m these words
"' The returns required to be made to the Secretary, as
you will perceive from the inclosed circular, are monthly,
&c As these statements for January and Tebruary last
have not been received at this Department, I must claim
your attention to the omission, and insist on their trans
mission, m future, immediately after the close of each
month.   At the same time, I would also claim your strict
attention to the regulations of the Department m respect to
the periodical deposits of the public money, and to the duty
of transmitting the usual evidences of such deposits to the
Secretary oí t íe 1 íeasurv, as the instructions require '
" [Signed by the Secretary of the Treasury, &c "j
In another letter of the Secretary to said re-
ceivei, bearing date May 23, 1836, he holds this
language-
" Since the date of my letter to you of the 25th ultimo,
your returns for the month of Apnl hive been received,
from which I percrive that the public moneys in vour hands
on the 3t)th ultimo amounted to the sum of i$247,2.}l 64,
which amount is the accumulated receipts of your office
since the 1st of Jinuarj last You cannot but be aware
that the retention of the public monejs in your hands be
yond the period of one month, unless the receipts of such
month be less than $10,000, is a violation of your instruc-
tions
" The object of this letter is—
" I To require that the whole balance on hand at the time
of the i ecu pt of this letter shill be immediately deposited,
and a certificate of such deposit tian-mitted to the Depart-
ment without delay
" 2 To inform you that the Department cinnot overlook
the omission to do so, or your future neglect to deposit
monthly, and to transmit your monthly returns, accompa-
nied by the evidence ol your deposit, in time to be received
at this office within the month next preceding that for which
the return is rendered
"31 hat any neglect ox inattention to these requirements,
unless satisfartorilvaccounted lor will require oí me, from
a sense of official duty, thatjou be r< poned to the Presi
dent, with a recommendation that you be removed from
office
" [Signed by the Secretary, and directed to the same ]"
In the two letters above leferred to, the duties
of the receiver ai e so cleai ly defi ned, and the con -
sequences to him of futuie neglect so explicitly
stated, that it would seem theie was but one al-
ternative left for him, that is, a strict perform-
ance of duty on his pait, oi a prompt removal
from office on the part of the Secietary, by le-
poitmg him to the President
Secretary of the Treasury to Elltan Ji  Broun  JSie , Com
imssioner of the General J and Office
" Sir It is desirable th u ui examination should be made
of the land office at I ort Wi\ up, Indian i And 1 request
you o notify Nathaniel We t, jr , ot Indianapolis, th tl lie
lias bi en selecti d foi that purpose and forw ud to him the
usual instructions, and piriiculirly to dueet his inquines
into the causes ol the delav on the pirt ot the receiver in
forwarding the returns 1i quired under the regulations of the
Department, and in making rliposits to the credit of the
Treasurer Tint officer Ins lately nnde a deposit of a large
amount, which has been acruuiul mug for seveial months
pa=t The examiner will aseen nil if possible, whether the
receiver or register hid heen using the money received on
siles in any manner, by loaning it or otherwise and what
are the reasons for the del ijs in depositing the money, and
in making returns, by both the register and receiver "
To which Mr Blown replied, giving certain
information, by his lettei of the 1st of July, to
which Mr Woodbuiy replied, as follows
" Tub/1, 3836
' Sir Your letter of this date, icspectlng the examination
of the land office it Foit Wayne, Ins been received I see
no excuse in the pipers picst tiled with jour letter fortbe
receiver not having deposited i íoílarfioin March till June,
nor having sent any monthly nbstricts to me m that time,
nor answered my letters remonstrating against his neglect
These things I wish specially mvestigitt d, as well as the
present state ot money on hand, &c , and the points before
indicated "
This is the tone in which the Secretary speaks
at the baie suspicion which attached to the íeceiver
But see how changed, how softened, his tone, how
ready to find excuses for him, when all the facts,
and more than he seemed to have apprehended,
were established by Mr West, the examiner'
From a letter of the Secretary of the Treasury
to E A Brown, Esq , Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office, dated July 8, 1836, it appears
that—
" I he returns of the receiver for the month of May have
Ken received, and exhibit a balance of money in his hands
at the close of that month, amounting to $601,380 49 He
has transmitted, under date of the 27th ultimo, a certificate
of deposit in the branch bank of Indiana, made on the 27th
of the same month, of $540 41109, leaving i balance in Ins
hands of $80,947 10 I have to request that you will instruct
Mr West, the examiner referred to in my letter above stated,
to make special inquiry into this matter, and to report to the
Department the result," &.c , &c
Mr West was appointed and entered on his
duties on the 11th day of August, 1836    In his |
report he says he shows a balance of $18,795 03
then due from said receiver to the United States
He says.
" Why this balance of §18,795 03 appears, has not been
explained, and if any explanations could be made, Mr
Spencer's absence precludes me irom giving it His clerk
thinks that he has still more money at Richmond, but is he
left for collection there, on the 1st of June, what they, on
the 1st day of August, finally passed to hi  credit I have
thought this not v«ry probable.  His clerk, though called I
up, gives me no schedule of the money he took with him to
Richmond, when he went to make his deposit on the 1st
of June
" IthmkMr Spencercouldnotwithpropnetyurge,when
he went to make a deposit on the 1st of June, as a good
cause for delay for not having done so before, the state of the
roads, as 11ree passage was open to lum via Logansport,
and no difficulty in his way "
(See his apology in his letter of the 20th June,
1836 ) He represents the books, papers, &c , in
the office, as being very negligently kept.
" The clerk urges as an excuse for the return not being
regularly made, during the months of January, February,
and March, that Mr Spencer did not think it necessary, as
the office was closed and no business doing This is a dif-
ferent excuse from what Mr Spencer made His irregu-
larity since, he (the clerk) states is owing ' to the great prcs
sure of business,' and I am convinced it has been very
great
" In answer to my question, why the present large sum
now with Mr Spencer wis allowed to accumulate, they
offer the letter of the president of the Indianapolis Bulk is
an excuse, a copy of whi.h is herewith inclosed It does
not appear when it was received, hut probably about the
22d ot July  
From this it appears that the $100,599 32spok-
en of by the receiver in his letter of the 22d of
August, as having been retained so long on hand,
was so íetamed by him without any such ej.cu.se
as therein set up
But what is stated heretofore by the examiner
may fall, perhaps, under the head of gross negli-
gence on the part of the receiver, which should
have been considered good cause of instant re
moval from office
But what follows must be placed under the head
of positive offense against law, principle, and mo
rahty.    He says-
" Upon the subject of using the money of the United
States I beg leave to state that 1 find it universally stater"
and believed md it is conceded to as a (act by the clerk 
i ii the receiver's office, that both he and his relative Dauson
have been much in the habit, m the office, ol shaving money
th it is, exchanging the money which could not be receivtc/
for public lands, the rate of exchange or discount vaiymg
ii in three to five per cent I find in the case of Isaiah
ti ells, ot Marion county, Ohio, that so íecently as the bib
instant, he paid into the hands of tin receiver, hi his office
ciju doll lislor exchmging $p40 ot Ohio bank notes of five
d< 11 irs each Fo whit extent this shaving business has been
carni d on in the office, of course I do not know, but I am
satisfied it his been to a very considerable extent, and tint
the Government money paid in by one ptrson his heen
handed out by the receiver in exchange lor uncurrent, or
not land office money—he receiving foi his ow n j rtuoie use
the discount as agreed upon , and that the same Govern
ment money again is passed into the land office, to be again
used for the like purpose, in pay lor the public lands 1 hat
the receiver has taken m banknotesof fivedollars, contrary
to orders, lhe schedule prepared at his office, herewith in
closed, will prove, that he received a bonus for taking the
same is, I think, almost beyond a doubt "
The examiner adds
Í(P S Mr Spencer has just come in, having been as far
as Richmond, where, by obtaining a rfwcotoir on some drafts
due in September, originally taken here for land, he was
enabled to swell his deposit theie to $j.2,831 34, which,
together with the nionev taken with him iiom heic, and
some other money, emblid him to deposit to the eiedit of
the United States $455,906 His own account will stand
thus
Here he states the account dcbtoi and creditor,
and strikes a balance, bringing the said receivei
indebted   to the United   States m  the  sum   of
l $5,206 84, which was at first stated at $3,216 84,
but corrected on the last page
After this report of West was made, William
Hendricks wrote to the Secretary the following-
Madisoi , ¿tugust 31, 1836
Sir I am informed that some things are stated recently,
to the prejudice of Colonel John Spencer, receiver at Fort
Wayne , and I am requested to write you
In doing so, I cm only say tint I have been gratified m
learning that his deposits have been made to your satisfac-
tion and if so, I hope that minor matters, if mere irregu
lanties, will be overlooked He is reputed tobe an honest
and honorable man, and I do not believe that he his míe n
tionally either done wiong, or violated his instructions H
would, to some extent, produce excitement, if he u-ere re
moved, for he has many u-arm and influential friends both at
i oii Wayne and in Dearborn county, from which he re
moved to his present residence    Bettfr i ex it be
With much respect,         WILLIAM HENDRICKS.
Hon Levi Woodblry, Secretary of the Treasury
This was enough " Better let it be'" And
immediately the Secretary wrote to Spencer the
following
Treasury Department, Scplcmbei 2,1386
Sir I hive received the report of Mr West, upon the
transactions of the land office under your charge, upon
v. hich I beg leave to remark, that the Department trusts
your deposits will hereafter be promptly made, and thitno
exchanges whatever, of money, will take place on any
terms, as they open a door to improper practices arid un-
founded imputations.   I am happy w add that the Depart
