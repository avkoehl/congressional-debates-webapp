upon Vicksburg. Moving forward the distance of 10 miles, I remained over night.

On the morning of the 19th, I resumed the advance in the direction of Vicksburg, 2 miles in the rear of which place I arrived with my command at 10 a. m.

In submitting this report, which is hurried and somewhat imperfect, I am pained to record the loss of Colonel Richards, commanding the Twentieth Illinois Infantry, mortally wounded in the battle of Raymond while in the discharge of his official duties; an efficient officer, the loss will be keenly felt by his fine regiment, greatly reduced by casualties incident to long service in the field.

I am also grieved to announce the death of Lieutenant-Colonel Snook, commanding the Sixty-eighth Ohio Infantry, killed in the action of Champion's Hill.

To particularize numerous instances of personal valor, where all evident such readiness to brave the danger of the battle-field, would be unjust to the general good deportment manifested by the officers and men of the THIRD DIVISION. Exposed to unusual hardships in an arduous campaign of thirty day's duration, with insufficient transportation, marching a distance of 200 miles, and actively engaged in four well contested battles with an ambushed enemy, the willingness with which all orders were carried out affords the commanding general a conclusive proof of their soldierly qualities and strict discipline.

To my brigade commanders, upon all of whom weighty responsibilities were imposed, the fidelity with which their various duties were discharged contributed to the success which has attended our arms. All of them gave me repeated indications of the coolness, firmness, and decision of character so essential in time of action.

To Major Stolbrand, my chief of artillery, I am indebted for valuable aid. To Major Townes, assistant adjutant general; Major John C. Fry, provost-marshal; Captain Wheaton, acting assistant inspector-general; Captains Holcomb and totaling, Lieutenants Moore, hoover, and Davis, aides-de-camp, and to Captain Wickizer, assistant quartermaster, and William H. Holbrook, acting commissary of subsistence, I am indebted for the prompt discharge of their various duties on the various marches for the prompt discharge of action, rendering me incalculable aid through their efficiency.

The following is a list of the casualties which occurred in the several battles in which my command has been engaged since the 1st instant:
