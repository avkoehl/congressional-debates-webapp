wit his cavalry at Richmond, and General G. Clay Smith, with the Ninth Pennsylvania Cavalry at Dnaville, have been notified to report to you ont e route at Mount Vernon or other point, withsuch informatinofthe enemy's position ad frce as they may ascertain. YOu will conduct this movement according to your judgment and in such manner as your knowledge and experience may dictate. It is important to keep open the line of transit of subsistence to General MOrgan's army at the gap; and, as his supplies may be limited, it is desireable that your movement be executed with dispatch. It is proper to say to you that the country beyond the Big Hill, in Madison County, is barren, and very little subsistence can be had for your men and temas, and you will have to take with you subsistence. You can require the farmers of Madison County to haul forage for you over the Big Hill to convenient depots, causing certificates to be given for fair prices.

Resepctfully,

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier- General, Commanding.

Major-General WALLACE,

Lexington;

General Smith telegraphs me from Crab Orchard that Barboursville is occupied by 12,000 or 15,000 rebel troops, ad Mount Vernonb y large cavalry force and artillery. If the forces at Lexington were drilled troops I would not hesitate to order an advnce to relief of General M	organ. Act on your judgment, as you know the quality of the troops. I can send several Indian regiments to you. I send balance of Andrews' battery.
