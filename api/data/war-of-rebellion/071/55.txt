WASHINGTON, July 4, 1864.

Colonel E. M. GREENE:

DEAR SIR: The troops that left here to-day for Harper's Ferry have arrived at monocacy and returned to Monrovia to unload and await orders from General Tyler, who is at Monocacy, if needed. I will act strictly in accordance with instructions to start the troops and battery from here together.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. KOONTZ,

Agent.

MONOCACY JUNCTION, [July 4], 1864.

Major General L. WALLACE,

Middle Department:

Everything quiet along our line. Major Waite, at Muddy Branch, reports that men in citizens' clothing are patrolling the Potomac, and when they find our men separated from their commands they bushwhack them. These men are supposed to belong to a Lieutenant-[Colonel] Mosby's gang of outlaws. I have instructed my command not to bring any of them to my headquarters except for interment. I think the Potomac up to the Point of Rocks well guarded, except against a large force. My men are throwing up earth-works at Monrovia and mount Airy to protect themselves against cavalry. We have a large force at this point.

E. B. TYLER,

Brigadier-General.

JULY 4, 1864.

Brigadier-General TYLER,

Send back the cars that brought up the Washington troops, as they are wanted immediately.

LEW. WALLACE,

Major-General, Commanding.

BALTIMORE, MD., July 4, 1864.

General MORRIS,

Fort McHenry:

Information received that the enemy have crossed the river at Point of Rocks, moving eastward. Put your command in readiness to act in the works, or to move, as may be necessary.

By order, &amp;c.:

SAML. B. LAWRENCE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
