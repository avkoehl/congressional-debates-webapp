Mr McKAY called Ike attention of the House
to Iht fict, that they had not proceeded m accord-
moo with the resolution of 1819, and even if we
had, th it resolution was believed by a good num-
ber of gentlemen to be unconstitutional, and not
binding upon them If, then, it was not binding
upon them, the inquiry might ause whether Blair
and Rues, h iving received a pluiahty of votes,
weic nol p't eled In proof of Ihis, he alluded to

to know how Ihe democratic republicans would
stand on this question, but as the question co lid
not now be irade, he would move to lay the leso-
lutton of the gentleman liom Missouri on the
table
