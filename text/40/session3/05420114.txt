It is argued with great earnestness that Con-
gress has no right to create a corporation in a
State. I grant that this is so, except in cases
where the creation of such a corporation is a
necessary, or at least a proper means of car-
rying into effect some one of the powers
expressly granted to Congress by the Consti-
tution. If the power to regulate commerce
among the several States be one of these pow-
ers, if that commerce must be to a very great
extent carried on over railroads, to deny to
Congress the right, under proper restrictions
and limitations, for the benefit of commerce,
to create a corporation for the purpose of
making that commerce free from the imposts
and heavy charges imposed either by indi-
vidual States or by corporations created by
such States, would bo to construe the Constitu-
tion as as if it read thus: "Congress shall have
the power to regulate commerce among the
several States, subject, however, to the con-
trol of each individual State at its pleasure."
This is not a case of first impression. The
precise point was argued by very eminent
counsel and decided by the Supreme Court of
the United States in the case of Osborn vs.
United States Bank, 9 Wheaton, 860, Chief
Justice Marshall delivering the opinion of the
court, and deciding that Congress has the
power to create a corporation in any case
where it is a proper instrument to carry into
effect any power vested in the Government of
the United States. Whether the bank was a
necessary agency in carrying out any of the
express powers conferred by the Constitution
upon Congress may be a matter of argument,
but no one can doubt that a railroad between
Washington and New York is an agency neces-
sary for the postal, military, and commercial
service of the United States.
But it is insisted that Congress has not the
right to authorize the taking the land of indi-
viduals within the several States. The right
of eminent domain existing in the States is
qualified by whatever right the Constitution
has vested in the United States. The question
is: is it necessary or proper, for the proper
regulation of commerce among the several
States, that a railroad should be constructed
between two or more States? If it is, Congress
has clearly the power to authorize its construc-
tion, and it is believed to be precisely the same
exercise of power as would be the improve-
ment by Congress of the navigation of a river
running through several States. In both in-
stances it would be the creation of a moans of
transportation of commerce not before exist-
ing, and would require in each case the appro-
priation of some soil of the State; and yet the
power to improve the navigation of the rivers
extending from one State to another has long
been exercised, and is believed to be unques-
tionable. The right to authorize the building
of bridges across the navigable waters of the
country has been repeatedly exercised by Con-
gress; and the exercise of such right repeatedly
sustained by the Supreme Court.
It is urged that Congress can pass no law
whereby the title to the soil can be divested
from the owner and vested in the corporation,
and that the power of the Government, unin-
terruptedly exercised from the beginning, to
erect light-houses, forts, arsenals, and dock-
yards is derived, not from their authority to
regulate commerce, but from the following
clause in the Constitution :
" To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases what-
soever over such district (not exceeding ten miles
square) as may by cession of particular States and
the acceptance of Congress become the seat of the
Government of the United States; and to exercise
like authority over all places purchased by the con-
sent of the Legislature of the State in which the same
shal 1 be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals,
dock-yards, and other needful buildings."
And contending that the consent of the State
was by this clause required to the erection
of light-houses, dock-yards, and other need-
ful buildings; and it is argued that this is
inconsistent with the idea that Congress pos-
sessed the power under other grants of the Con-
stitution. The mistake in this argument is
evident in not adverting to the real object of
the clause in question, which is not to enable
the United States to hold lands in the States,
but simply to give Congress exclusive jurisdic-
tion over such places as should be purchased
with the consent of the States.
The Supreme Court have decided(3 Wheaton,
388) that Congress may purchase land for a
fort or light-house and erect such buildings
without the consent of the States, but that in
such cases the jurisdiction remains with the
State, and cannot be acquired by the United
States except by a cession.
Mr. VAN TRUMP. Will the gentleman
yield to me for a question?
Mr. COOK. I will.
Mr. VAN TRUMP. I would inquire of
the gentleman why the several State conven-
tions, preparing constitutions for the respective
States, expressly declared the power of emi-
nent domain to be in the States, while the Fed-
