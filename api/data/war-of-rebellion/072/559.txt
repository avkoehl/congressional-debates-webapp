officers and men of this command are entitled to high commendation for the manner in which they went into and sustained themselves throughout this engagement. I but quote the language of a distinguished division commander, who witnessed the progress of the battle, when I say that "no troops ever fought better or more bravely."

I have the honor to transmit herewith the reports of the different regimental and battalion commanders, and would respectfully call attention to their commendation of officers for gallant conduct. I would also respectfully call attention to the fact that there is not a sufficient number of officers with the command to enable the brigade to operate as effectively as it could if more were present. In my judgment, the thanks of the country are due to all the officers of this brigade who participated in the battle for the intrepidity of their conduct in action. To the battalion commanders-Captain Jewett, First Battalion, Fifteenth Infantry; Captain McManus, Second Battalion, Fifteenth Infantry; Captain Barry, Sixteenth Infantry; Captain Kellogg, Eighteenth Infantry, and Captain Mooney, Nineteenth Infantry-great praise is due for the manner in which they maneuvered their commands, and for their personal bravery in action. I regret to say that Captain Kellogg was severely wounded in the arm while leading his command (Eighteenth Infantry) up to the breast-works of the enemy. Captain Kellogg had crossed the works on horseback, and was urging the men forward at the time he was wounded. Captain Hull, of the same regiment, then assumed command, and fully sustained his high reputation as a soldier. It is due to the three officers serving on the brigade staff, Captains Fetterman and Mills, Eighteenth Infantry, and Lieutenant Estes, Sixteenth Infantry, to say that throughout the whole day's operations, their conduct was conspicuous for gallantry and bravery in the discharge of their duties.

Appended I have the honor to submit a condensed report of the number of muskets taken into the battle, together with the loss in killed, wounded, and missing.
