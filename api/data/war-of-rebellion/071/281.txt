The following has just been received:

I have my men, about 250, posted within one miles of Rockville. Captain McKendry who was sent out toward that place, has just been driven in. There are many rebel sin the town now, and I hear that there is a brigade on the other side of the town, drawn up in line. I have sent out a party to see if they can see them, and will report as soon as they come in. the enemy has evidently a strong rear guard.
