this harbor and also the exit of any private boat from the harbor without reporting at Fort Pickens. The commanding officer of Fort Pickens will appoint an officer of his command to examine all such vessels. If any private boat attempts to pass the line between the wharves of Pickens and Barrancas without indicating an intention to stop a blank cartridge will be fired at her; if that fails to bring her to a shot will be fired in front of her bows, and the officer on duty at Forts Pickens and Barrancas will be justified in firing into any boat disregarding a second challenge. The cornet, four fields red and white alternate, commencing with the red on the hoist, hoisted at the mizzen masthead of the guard ship Potomac, will indicate s suspicious vessel off the port.

Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Mil. Div. of West Miss., New Orleans, La.:

COLONEL: I have to report that information was received here on the 1st instant from General Gillmore leading to a suspicion that Jeff. Davis and other prominent leaders of the rebellion might attempt an escape through Florida. On the 2nd I started for Cedar Kyes, which was reached on the 4th. Major Weeks, commanding that post, was immediately ordered to picket the mouths of the Suwannee, Wacasassee and Crystal Rivers; also at the mouth of the Withlacoochee and at Bayport. While at Cedar Keys a citizen was brought in who reported a party of thirteen persons, three of whom he thought to be general officers, as having brought a boat through the country on wheels and landed the same at Crystal River, and were to have started for Bayport on the 2nd. Immediately I started down the coast, hoping to overhaul the party. I cruised beyond Cape Sable, narrowly inspecting the coast and searching all vessels encountered. I am satisfied that the boat has not escaped. I then picketed the reef from Key West to Indian Key, the navy picketing from the latter place to Cape Florida, where the East Gulf Blockading Squadron joins in this duty
