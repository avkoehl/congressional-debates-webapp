to our military success. About one-half of the officers of these corps capable of taking the field have thus gone into the volunteers, and those that remain, though in the most responsible positions and performing very arduous duties, have daily to undergo the extreme mortification of being below nearly every one around them of their own age. At the present moment the Chiefs of Engineers and Topographical Engineers of our armies, of from fifty to one hundred and fifty thousand men, are only lieutenants and captains, while their juniors of their own and almost every arm of service are brigadiers and major-generals of volunteers, who have by no means more important duties to perform.

The organization proposed by this bill gives some increased rank to our engineers, thus offering a somewhat adequate reward for their talents and services and stimulating them to remain in the performance of their necessary professional labors.

This organization is also more in conformity to the practice of most governments, which appreciating the elevated function of engineers, confer upon them the advantages of high rank so essential to their positions in armies, and so liberally compensated in civil life.
