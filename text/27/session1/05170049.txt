Abolition Petitions—Mr Rayner.

Slat  i ouiy pjit ot a grade a-, i wd'r rmv -

what has taken place n toe Weil India islands, m
Africa, and in China itself I was really surpn ei
to hear a mancf his reach and power of under-
standing ad anee an argument on this ground
which tin most pigmy intellect could put down m
a moment What' «¡r,does a> put the power o'
this House rn i frvel with the power of ¡re British
Parliament? Has he qjite iorgotten tae C nsi m
tion? Has it escaped bis recollection that our
powers a^e bm ted, while that ot the Parliament is
said to be oran potent? If the Gov, mm r of
England and F anee hsv seei fi to abolish I /p

lause    And wi'h icgaid to ihe in
terference ot the gentler sex in this question, of
Abo'ition, h* would only say that those who kne.w
him well, knew that he would be the last ¡nan,up-
on earth th it would say any thing against the fe-
male portion of creation. No one bowetl with
-nore sracr ly to the majesty of woman than h«
did, and it v is his high regard for the female oha-
i acter, and hi- conception of its dignity and its
worth, whic-s made him look upon the fact of their
interference in this question with sorrow and re-
gre' Worn* n have no business to be interfering
where men are contending for empire, and
siinnld never mingle in such political strifes
ss men vx re frequently contending for. On
tn contran , it was the part of woman to sooth and
allay the 'ormy and angry pas ions of men, in-
stead oi w< itmg them to persevere and plunge
leeper and 'ceper still in angry and violent contro-
ver íes Bi t when thev wffild amu«e themselves
by ii errer r¿ m scenes m which they ought to have
noth n  lo c' , they must expect (heir conduct to be
arragned rind commented upon, and this he felt
hi nselt bt i nd lo do in th° discharge of his duty,
and m vmdioiton of the character of the females
of the Sout , whose modesty and sense of pro-
p lety, he would say, would prevent them from
adopting the course which had beentaken by those
of their own sex at the North. In his opinion, it
always denoied a distempered state of the'public
mind, when women were to be seen taking part in
p diiieal aflVirs All the plans and intrigues which
e1 to ¡he eh vation of Cromwell, as Protector oí
Engl nd («nd sho, he might say, was one of the
greau scoundrels ihat ever lived,) were managed
and concerle I at meetings for prayer, in Which
wom-B par i"ipated. What sort of an Administra
non v* as he t m the reign of Charles IK Why,
muioeisw r turied out of and put into office un-
d"r the mfiu nee of the Duchess of Cleveland, or of
No l Gwy n and tne revolution of Pans, and all
the horrid bi tohcrips and disasters which resulted
from it, pr< ct edtd mainly from the influence of the
women He regretted, then, to see that the female
poraon of ihe Northern community should have
laken any part or lot m the proceedings of the
About  nisi- or should have exercised their influ-
ence i-> any alie npts lo destroy the peace and bar-
n ony c t he Siuth, and to overturn Ihe foundations
of í   s polit ra' fabric.
Mr R c íe now to speak of this subject in
ralhei ■> ufl rent point ofvievthan any in which
he hid yet n icrd it He cafeto speak of it m
connect on wim ihe pr«.g ess of afFiirs m this hall
H> thought it was time lhat the North and the
S uth shou'd understand each other on tbis sub-
jpct. He wi bed the South to know who were its
inends and vro were its enemies The gentleman
'r it  Massachusetts took the portion that this was
he great quts ion between ihe North and the South,
H'd u e q un betv ecn liberty and slavery.
He [Vír "¡o  is] ha 1 sS1j ihat the 21st rule was
ajopted in tbj i? t Congress as an Administration
i ifia^ure, an ' he spoke wuh apparent supprise of
ts abolitii n ai ¡his sesionas a Whig measure.
Ni , he cou'd harJly think that this was really the
tpi uno ih genileman Tom Massachusetts But
i wa s sto o ' 11 the speech of the genileman from
t ssacbuse and it nad gone forth on the wmgb
of h- w nd in 1 t had received the quiescent ap-
, robot on o t e neople Now, if this was a ques-
ion i o w =i e North and the South, and a ques-
u n ol Ho r ¡rd spvery, and f we were to be
eirn? ly ao> yedon the subject, and if all politi-
es en i jit \ d fferenees were to be merged
n «ii  grt i question, the sooner it was decided
11 bo er 'Vere Northern gentlemen, he asked,
wi i'pg to pnlerce ihe proposition of the gen-
pinan from Massachuselt^ If not, why did
y suffer t>r firebiand to be hurled from his
i|i b < t abroad in toe country, without any
Ho t being mtde lo extinguish Us fire? Now.
t ue ¿t¿s oris thing very certain m regard to
i pet p'e t ( die South, and he did not pretend to
peak for any t tlvr portion of it except his own
d tnct, and he knew that the people theie would
r her die than t e driven from their rights Bat,
11 the Soalliffin country, it mattered not what
mi«rit be the political d fferences which had existed
heietofore on other subjects, they, at least, upon,
