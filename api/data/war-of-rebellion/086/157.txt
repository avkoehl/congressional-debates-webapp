CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., October 21, 1864.

General EWING:

I have not yet heard form the force I sent to Fredericktown and Pilot Knob, and as there was a telegraph operator with them I judge that the company intended for Fredericktown went to the Knob. I have ordered two companies of Enrolled Missouri Militia to be at Fredericktown next Friday with orders to report to Major Williams. Will you please notify him?

H. M. HILLER,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
