HDQRS. DISTRICT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, Tenn., September 24, 1863.

[GORDON GRANGER,]

Commanding.

[J. S. FULLERTON,]

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

GENERAL: This is the most complete statement that Major Fullerton can furnish. It is correct as far as it goes. Nashville and La Vergne he cannot give.

C. GODDARD.
HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY, DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Island Ferry, September 24, 1863.

General GARFIELD,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Mr. Evans, a citizen just in from 10 miles north of Chattanooga on the Cleveland and Chattanooga road, reports that the enemy are concentrating a large cavalry force in the vicinity of Cleveland, and intend trying to cross the river at some point between Soddy Shoals and Blythe's Ferry. I have cavalry at Soddy Shoals, and have ordered Minty to look out there above wherever they could cross.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL: General Mitchell went off before this letter was finished. He directed me to say that the command was getting very much extended, stretched out along the river, watching the fords. I trust my explanation of the reason assigned above will be satisfactory.

WM. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
