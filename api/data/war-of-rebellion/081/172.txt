General MEADE:

I sent one brigade of Ayres' this morning to assist General Cutler on extreme left, who is directed to get possession of the redoubt and some houses on the enemy's right of the intrenchments Burnside took yesterday morning. Crawford's division is in with General Burnside's men on his left, and ordered to attack with them. I have Griffin's division and two brigade of Ayres' in reserve to send in anywhere they may be wanted.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

P. S.-Griffin just massing here. Orders to Crawford to advance and Ayres to support.

Birney has advanced, and reports no enemy in his immediate front. What is the state of the case with you, and what is the delay in your attack?

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-5.20 a.m.

The last report from Birney is that a deserter just in says the enemy have retired to an inner line of works, not very distant from those occupied yesterday.

(Same to General Burnside and Neill.)

General Cutler has advanced to the enemy's lines on the extreme left and found them deserted. Heavy smoke can be seen from that point toward Petersburg. He is ordered to advance, keeping his left resting on the railroad.
