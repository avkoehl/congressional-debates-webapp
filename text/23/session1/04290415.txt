for the original resolution of th  House, are ready
to vindicate its legality, justice, and propriety,
and for that purptee have ¡ecommcnded most
respectfully the on'y measure which appeared to
them consistent with nose principles They are
not in teai of the judj; oent of their constituents
Gentlemen may talk foi effect of the arrest of
dis'inguished citizens, and may pompously parade
before the pi bhc mind th¿se torn teen gentlemen in
custody of our Sergeant at Anns This scene
cam ot detei any man in the performance of his
duty No one has ever attended the session of a
county court who has not witnessed similar pro
ceedings There, if a witness refuses to obey a
summons., he is attached for contempt, and fined
or mprisored, at the discretion of tie enmt
There, a sheuff or juror is liable to the service of
the sime piocess
But, wnat shall we say of another por'ion of
the remaiks of the dist nguished gentleman, with
whose opinion alone, let it be understood, Í am
combating? lowards him personally I wish to
manifest, what I feel, a sincere respect But what,
I repeat, must be the judgment of this House
and of the public, on the attempt to ridicule the
idea hat our Sergeant at Aims can arrestfouiteen
men' Are we, then, to conclude that gentlemen
are prepared to resist the lawful authority of the
House? He mquiies, too, will the State of Penn-
sylvania pe mit fourteen of her citizens to be puis
moneri to the bar of this House? Sir, (said Mr
r ,) the people of Pennsylvania are not ready to
rebel at the will of any m in or set of men T hey
will not be prepaied to resist the laws at the bid-
ding, or to promote the ultenoi purposes of any
paity Let but an msuneetionary spnit display
i self, and eveiy man who loves the institutions
which have shed then benign influence upon every
part of this noble Confederacy, will stand forth to
vindicate the supremacy of the laws
Mi T said,he hoped the House would pardon
these remaiks He was sensible they would be
more apprrpiiate when the reports of the bank
comm ttee cune un for consideiation He dis
lrted seuously the practice which prevailed here
of discussing questi >ns not immediately before the
House, yet he could not consent to have his own
course, and a measure of which he uecidedly ap-
proved, done injustice to in tnis debate, without
íeply tie hoped tne House would not adjourn
until the 30 h of June, and before that day would
act decidedly and correctly on the grave ques-
tions which were involved in the bank report,
and oi other higl 'y impoitant measures not yet

Mi HlLSiERienewed the call foi thepievious
