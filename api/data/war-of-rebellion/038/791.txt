MERIDIAN, April 26, 1863.

General J. C. PEMBERTON:

I just received the following dispatch from General Ruggles:

COLUMBUS, MISS., April 26.

Major-General LORING:

From information, the report of the enemy in large force at Bankston is without foundation, in my opinion.

DANIEL RUGGLES.

W. W. LORING.

JACKSON, MISS., April 26, 1863.

Major-General LORING, Meridian, MISS.:

As no additional force has passed the railroad, they can have no more than had before. You have troops enough to defend Meridian and Enterprise.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 26, 1863.

Captain R. C. LOVE, Brandon, MISS.:

Ascertain where the enemy is, and go in that direction. You will not stay at Brandon, but if enemy is at Raleigh, go there and get on his rear, and plant ambush and annoy him. See if something can be done.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, April 27, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

However necessary cavalry may be to Army of Tennessee, it is indispensable to me to keep my communications. The enemy are to-day at Hazlehurst, on New Orleans and Jackson Railroad. I cannot defend every station on the road with infantry. Am compelled to bring down cavalry from Northern Mississippi here, and the whole of that section is consequently left open. Further, these raids endanger my vital positions.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

TULLAHOMA, April 27, 1863.

General PEMBERTON:

Cavalry from Mobile is directed to operate in enemy's rear. Am sorry that you did not sooner report raid in Southern Mississippi. Above 3,000 cavalry have crossed the Tennessee, but are employed by the troops from Corinth. We are informed that FIFTEEN of twenty-four transports on the Tennessee are from Grant.

J. E. Johnston.

RICHMOND, April 27, 1863.

Lieutenant General J. C. PEMBERTON, Jackson, MISS.:

Impossible to comply with your wish respecting cavalry. Enemy's fleet still on the coast of the Carolinas and not expected to move south of Florida.

S. COOPER.
