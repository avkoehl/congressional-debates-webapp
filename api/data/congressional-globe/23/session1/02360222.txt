REMARKS OF MR. WRIGHT,
OF   NEW YORK,
In Senate, Thuisday, Match 6, 1834.
[The question being upon the fifth resolution
offered by Mi Poindlxtek, and he having mod-
ified the resolution so as to authorize the committee
to have deposition"? taken at a distance, as well as
to examine witnesses befoie themselves, and Mr
Siiiiiiy having moved an amendment to direct
the committee, when the testimony to be taken was
of a character to implicate the official conduct of
any officer, to give that officer notice, and an
oppoitumty to attend at the taking of the testi-
mony, and to cioss examine the witnesses]—
Mr WRIGHT said, heshould ha\econsideied
tt e mollification made by the honorable chairman
of the commi'tee full and ^ufiuent, but for decla
rations which had fallen from othei members of
the Senate He did not rise to express any want
of confdence in the committee Under the mod
ification of toe resolution, he should have assumed
that the committee would have given notice to any
office of the Government whose official acts were
impigied by an> evidence appearing be ore them,
and that they would have given such officer an
opportunity tor exculpation by testimony, before
they would report matteis of accusation or im-
peachment He would have entertained this opin-
ion,  because the course  would be  so   palpably
required injustice to accused public officers; and,
but for the declarat ons to which he referred, he
would have cheerfully concuired in the remaik
made by the honorable S°nator from Alabama,
[Mr Kimg,] and would have presumed that the
course of the committee, in making their mvesti
gations, would be such as he had indicated
He was, however, not now at liberty to make
this presumption, because it had been distinctly
declared by the honorable Senator from Connecti-
cut, [Mr Smith,] and intimated by several other
memoers, in the course of their remarks, that it
would not be the duty of the committee to give
any notice to any accused officer, that the com
mittee were a mere inquest, that they were to act
as grand jurors, and in no ether character, that
they were not to hear exculpatory evidence, if
offered, but that they were to act exclusively m an
ex parte and accusatory character This was pre
sentmg the duties of the standing committees of
this body in a new light to him Were they mere
bodies of inquest, mere ex parte examiners of the
subjects referred to them' He had not so under-
stood the matter He had understood that the
duty of a standing committee of the Senate was to
examine the merits of the questions referred to
them, and to advise the Senate as to ltsfinsil action
Now, it seemed that they were meie bodies of ex
paile inquiry, and what, he would ask, was to be
done with such a report when it came in ' What
was this ul'enor and finpl action of which gentle-
men spoke' Was it to refer the report back to
the same committee, with instructions to examine
the other side of the subject' What else could it
be' If the Senate was not to obtain full inform
ation through its committees, how was that ínfoim-
ation to be obtained' What was the course of
the committee upon ordinary bubjects' Was it
merely to make ex paite inquiry' If so, where
was the testimony upon the other side to come
from' Mr W said, the position was a mistaken
one The committees of this body are not placed
in the situation of grand jurors It is not their
duty to make expaite examinations, but to inquire
into themeuts oi allsubjects referred to them,and
to make a íeport advising the Senate as to its final
action. Until, therefore, he could receive some
intimation that this committee would so consider
its duties, that it would feel bound to notify such
officers as might be accused before it, and to give
them an opportunity to be heard in their defence,
he could not vote for the resolution, as modified
by the honorable movei, but must vote for the
amendmentwhich made thatan expressduty He
could not believe it was the intention of theSenate
to make the duties of this committee under the
resolutions accusatory only, to put whole classes
of officers witmn their power for the purpose of
having them íeport to the Senate, and spread be-
fore the public, ex paite examinations and accusa-
tions which the persons accused had had no op-
portunity to answer or explain Still such had
been the piactical effect of the opinions and views
expiessed by the honniableSenatoi from Connec-
ticut, [Mi Smith,] and,as he understood, assented
to by others, and until counter indications should
be given by the committee, he must be in favor of
the amendment
[Mr CLAY replied, referring to companies
which had been formed to speculate in the pur-
chase of lands, and inquired who weie to be noti-
fied' That if the comoiittee weieto be compelled
to give notice, it would defeat the whole object of
the inquiry, thatgentlemen seemed to be mistaken,
and constantly to suppose that officers were to be
accused that auch was not the object of the in
quny, that the mquny was to be made for the
purposes of general legislation and to correct abuses
al'eged to exist in the system of selling the puolic
lands, &c , &c ]
Mi WRIGHT said, the second resolution re-
fers to ti e combinations and compames to which
the honorarle Senator fiom Kentucky [Mr Clay]
alludes To those peisons he did not a&k that
notice should be given He cared not what the
result of an investigation might be to them They
were not public officers, and had acted upon their
private responsibility only But if the iionorab'e
Senator had cast his eye over the thud resolution,
he would have seen that he was widely mistaken
in sunposing that the express direction to the com-
mittee was not to mqu.re into the official conduct
of every land officer in the whole united States.
He would read the resolution     It was as follows:
"3 Resolved, That the said committee be in-
structed to inquiie whether the registeis of the
land offices, and the receivers of public money,
at any of the land offices of the United States, or
either of them, hav e, m violation of law and of their
official duties, demanded or accepted a bonus or pre-
mium from any purchaser or purchasers of the
public lands at public or private sale, for the ben-
efit of such officer or officers, as a condition on
which such purchaser or purchasers should be
allowed to enter or purchase any tract or tracts
| of land offered for sale by the United States, and
also, whether any register or receiver, as afore-
said, has been guilty of fraud or partiality in the
I sales of the public lands by adopting rules and
regulat ons, in then respective offices, inconsistent
with the laws of the United States "
Here was a positive direction to inquire into the
conduct of these officer?, and info their violations of
the laws of the United States, and to make these in-
quiries only It was to such officers that he
thought notice should be given He d d not be-
lieve that they should be cot demned unheard If
the honorable Senatoi would look further, he would
find that the fourth íesolution contained the same
direction, confined to the land offices in the State
of Mississippi, and to a particular description of
illegal acts [Here some Senator remarked that
this íesolution had been so modified as to extend
to all the land offices of the United States ] Mr.
W proceeded He said he stood corrected, 'hat
he was told this resolution also had been made aa
broad as the third, and it only strengthened the
ground for which he contended
The Senate wou'd see that he could feel no in-
terest in these inquiries The land offices were so
far removed from his State that neither himself
nor his constituentsknew much about them, or the
officers who oecup'ed them That abuses might
ex st was no more than likely, and he hoped to be
believed when he said that no member of theSen-
ate was more willing or anxious than.he was that
where they existed they should be ferieted out and
the guilty punished Still he was unprepared to
say that ex parte accusations should be spread be-
fore the public against any officer of the Govern-
ment AH ought to be heard, and to have an
opportunity for explanation and defence, and his
present object was to cause the question before
the Senate to be clearly urtdeisiood, that every
member might vote as his judgment should dic-
tate For his own part, aftei the distinct declaia-
tion of the honorable member of the committee,
[Mr Clay,] that notice ought not to be given,
that he, as a member of the committee, should not
feel bound to give such notice, but should consider
it improper to give it, he (Mr W ) had no alter-
native but to vote for the amendment, which re-
qmied that notice should be given to any accused
officer, and that he should be allowed to cross-
examine the witnesses against him, and to make
his defence
Conclusion of the Iiepoi t of the Comwtlee of Ways
#nd Means, on the removal of the Deposites.
It will be seen by the views already taken by the
committee, that in their opinion the deposites have
been lawfully íemoved fiom the Bank of the Uni-
ted States, and the money now in the Treasury
has been legally deposited in theSta'e banks
In these circumstanies it remains to be consid-
eied whether any, and if any, wnat legislation la
necessary, in consequence of the change of the
deposites
It is the opinion of the committee that the Bank
of the United States ought not to be rechartered
The constitutional objections to it are, in their
judgment, insuperable, and if its chaiter could be
justified by the Constitution, recent events have
demonstrated that the continued existence of such
a vast concentrated money power must prove
dangerous to the freedom and purity of oui insti-
tutions
And after the great abuses of which it has been
guilty, a rechartei, under any modifications, would
I be offering the high legislative sanction and appro-
bation of Congress to the various acts of miscon-
duct detailed in this and former reports to Congress
I It is impossible that a corporation, which is proved
