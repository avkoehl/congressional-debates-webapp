Major W. HOFFMAN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Southern Div. of Louisiana, New Orleans:

The water is falling here very fast, leaving the ground around our levees in many places exposed and smelling badly. There is no doubt but what we shall have a great amount of sickness among the troops stationed here. The air will be bad the water poor, and vegetables, on account of the overflow, very scarce. I therefore respectfully request permission to dismantle Fort Buchanan and remove its armament to this point, and as soon as that is done to remove part of the garrison to Franklin, a healthy location, and one, while it covers, the post here, is easy of access.

I am, very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

R. A. CAMERON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding District.
