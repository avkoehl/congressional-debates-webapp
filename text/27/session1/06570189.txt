__27thCong-"1st Sbs8_._             _         Appeal on a Point of Order—Mr. Bayard.                                          _          Senate.
Mr CUTHófe-RThadbutafew word  to say
m allusion to the compliments pa d him by the
Senator from Kentucky He hoped he wou'd not
upset the Senator'  htlant, by «tatmg that he (Mr
Cuthbert) hau ro ambition to see the Senate imi-
tate the House m ih  sort oí "action, action,"
wh ch the Senator so much a Inured—action with-
out debate It the Senate uasslowtr m us pro
gress, it was becau«e n took time 'o deliberate
The Senator felicitated himself ve-v jocularly on
having a Whig Hou e (f Representatives to his
own mmd, and acting as he dictated, wit íout de-
bating. The difference is, there he has a Whig
House, which decides measures without debating
them here he is not s0 fortui ale, he cannot get
his measures passed without being d bated
Mr. CLAY Well, Í don't kn ; but the Sera-
tor from Geoigia is entiiltd to his irmarks with
out further observation He (Mr Clay) fe't in
too good humor to put himself under tne n cessit/
of being agam reproved from tnat qj3r t A-
long as tne i/ther House dec de as it do=s -without
debate h  (Mr ClayI is i'erv w<II sausfi d with
it. That House is doma glorious wo t with «it
debate—pacing, in ucecssion, a loan bil',
a tariff b 11, a dis nbu ion b 11, aid no v,
to crown all a glorious Bank b It This wasdoi g
something bettei than debating It was doing so
surpassingly well, that he dd not know but the
people would decide unrn h v r>g all their bu i iess
henceforward done witro it debating at ail When
the people contiast the u/0 House , th°y will cer-
tainly rkeide against debating Tie did not doubt
but it would be a gr at improvement With re-
gard to the doctrine  rf the Senator from South
Carolina, he takes up Mr Jefferson's Manual and
says, don't talk of yocr Hou?e of Representatives
while >ou have this Well, vvat is if Why, it
is nothing but Mr Jeffe«,o[ >, Manual af er all. It
is a manual co npiled from H?t e1, ti'Ewes, bx¡i
other ; and pr nted by au oí * oí Oorgrtss, ru
though Congress m*y b-s.. d by it n the absence
of us own rules, theti is no obi gation that i
should be so. The same Manu il has been trans-
lated and pri«'ed in oth r countries, and js merely
referred to by deliberative bodi s m the ab enee of
local rules, wnich must always- be paramount It
cannot ha /e 'h= same .iiithor t? as ¡lie rules and
usage of Cou-ress itreif To say, then, that the
decisions of trie Hna^e of Re[ resentatnes are not
to be looked mío n preteicnce to ihe Jtr sion* of
the Hou=e of Commons m En?'and, was a doc
trine which he ho¡>e i the Sei alt was too patriotic
not to repudiate He re3lly thought there had
been inou^h of his contest, and that, foi the sake
of getting inwih the bj ine s o the countiy so
anxious y locked for, the woo o subject ought to
be laid on the table
Mr EVANS had if"  word  'o ayonlheques
tion of oide Cm <m appe 1 ron the decision
of the Ch i on a qjrsli " ol orter be lai 1 on tKe
tablea Tn\t is ti* quest o i He wa clearl) ol
optn on it could, except in ca«">s of known exemp
tions, sucias motions of postponement, brcaise
the motion u postpone recssarily carries v th it
the prueipal subject Ta" curse seemed to b*
necessary in order to a'lrw 11 Senate to shield i -
presiding officer from a 'erisi >n calculated to es
sen the respect which "-houl I o  pnterta ned for
him Such has b>oa he usa >e foi six or seven
years m the other Hoase It o get rid o astil

is in fart a pprn drcision
Mr CALHOUN i «pianed that it cam   ir m rr I
position of tne Hous  m r lanon to Aoolmon peti

Mr EVANS s?ul he ad mi led the far!, but
it had authority from paruamtn'aiy i)=agc, as
the Senator v oul I find f he too et mo Ihe
prac ice tí the < iher House, i hundreds of
other tne It is mged that by laj n? appeal O't
the iab e,ir*v "ower ,. «e it- the pre id tig oTi
cer, buti it not always m t e poser  f ihe Se
nate to wi hhold that poOTr by refusing to lay the
appeal on th" tab et In Sir Adams' ease he had
made hi  appeal and then -a down, it was afer
he had tak..n his seat that the motion to lay on the
table was made
Mr C4LH0ÜN That dd not alter the ease
The object was to rut off debate on thp Abol ion
subj'Ct Mr Adams, in order to elude the rule,
made a motion of appeal on which he and his
friends migh speak It was to defeat his tbjert
that the motion to lay the appeal on the taMe pre
vailed Itwa? out of this distorted practice that
the moistious rule grew which is now sought to be
applied 11 ihe Senate Was it proper to take from
that subject any precedent frr this bod)? It the
gag iv to b appl 'Met it n< I be through that in
strumenta ity But, <-a,d Mr C I nave s tit lor
the j urnalsofthe House, and I find that my im
predion was corrrctm supposing that the e?s  rose
oi oer an Abolition pe mon pre enitd by Mr
Aiams to the House, a d which was onri'd fo the
tibie without drbat  under a ptsitue ru'e of the
House which ordered all -uch petitions to be laid
on ti e tibie without debate This rule Mr Adams
attemnted toe\ale by raising a question of o'der,
w th a view of discussing the question of Abolition
The Speaker dpeided him to be out of order An
appe?! was m d  from the decision oí the Chair,
whtn ihe d cu sion of Abolition wa, ¡enc^rd, to
prevent v^hicn it was moved to lay the appeal on the
tabie Such were the peculiar circumstances, under
which thismtonous precedent was made, and which
it is now insi ted shall become the estah ished rale of
tn s hody The question of Hying the aioeil was
taken by yeas ana na}- At thi head of the nnjsl

Evai s I would bt> glad to know whether he i«t tne
gentleman who now. so manfully suppi rts vhat he

The Senitor from. Maine is very positive in his
assertion that tj. appeal can be laid on thp tab e
He would ask hm whether a qies'ion of ord i,
oefore it wasdecidtd by th" Ohuir, cjuld b  bid

Hon
Mr F^VANS I ditroi repud ate it in th" other
House I merely voted wilh my friend , because
I considered it a settled po n —t^e maj< r ty had
decided it
Mr. CALHOUN First impressions are gene-
rally sale, and may be trusted. As to the decision
beinj of long standing, he believed that was a
mistake, it certainly began in. the very case cited.
Bad as it was in the other Housp, it would be in-
finitely worse m this There the Speaker was one
of the body, elected to the chair by a majority of
the House Here the chair is filled, not by one of
our members, but by an officer chosen by the
people.
Mr. LINN said he did not profess to understand
all the mtiicauesof rule  of ordei very well; bat
he hou„ht hetould take a plain common sense
view of the subject, and it was this; that if there
are ruks which have been found sufficient tor fifty
jears to g¡ vera the Senae, they ought to be ad-
hered to tih snppla ited by better rules, and if new,
rules are wanted, let a committee be established to
get toem up Such a committee, acting on the
pnncipls of the caucus c immtttee n another "glo-
rious" place, could get up i«ies to&mt every occa-
sion, atl hbiium The "tntlemen in power
could ih°n have rules manipulated into any
^hap to suit their convenience. He really
thought some of the members of the Sena e
mus' have been m the habit of associating wnh the
celebrated Joe Smth., the Mormon, for they had
picked up his system of miracle-making to perfec-
tion Joe'i rtle was to have a fresh revelation
every morning, suitable 10 the emergency of t¡-e
day If he ranted to do something to-day that he
aid ni t wunt to do vesterday, he had a fresh reve-
lation to di cloacas a foierunner So it is with the
Senator f wh n they want to apnly the gag to the
Oppo'-m >n side of the House, they have a revela-
tion to make of an Abolition rule that has worked
muacles in the other Hou<e If the gag was in-
convenient <o themselves, they would have a f-esh
revelation that it was not appl cible to this cham-
ber at all This iey can, h> a species of Mormon
revelations 1 ke those of Toe Smith, make the i ule
woik not only ooth. ways, but work or not work, just
at p easure It would be reco'lected how miracu-
lously they worked their revelation on the subject
tf the public prmling They actually discovered
new rulea that the uninitiated in political revela-
tions hid ovirlooked for twentv-twc }ears. The
peculiar discovery seems to be, that if they find
out a rule that works in favor of a political
opponent, they may u ake use of it themselves first,
but ihe mom nt it i s sanded over to their competi-
tors, a new revelation ma\ be had, by giving it a
dexterous shake, ard then it is no longer a rule,
but the shadow of «. i ule Now, with regard to ihe
matter at piesent un'er discussion, if he (Mr
Linn) oiidi rotood it, it was this that a motion was
made '< print, which was ordered le he tn the ta
ble That was, m efftct, a civil way of refusmg
to punt, but imoun d fo nothing more Well,
the >, stpprse thp mover did not thma: 'he printing
e«ber tia1, -in i then moved lo lay lh<  papers on ti c
tibb a so, i r t íeftr ti em to a select commu'ee,
W( uld he not have a rt ht to do sc' Certainly he
wou'd Yei, how (oul! be do n, if th  decision of
the Ci-iir vtas c nect that the motion to pr nt car-
ried  iti it the pape s themselves') It did appear
o him I'm *n attempt to sustain such a decision
was not t ns mm win the g od feelings which
the hi°rr fr, of this body ha ' al«ays heretofore
er tertame I for each other, in «pite of political com-
plect ns There was a point beyond which no
p<irtv<ould go wi h impunity Up io the point
vhere fribearince c a«es to be a virtue, it was
m'  lipn«tl to go There hai always been a
diopositio i sinng y evinced in this body io
sus am (he Chair Thai disposmon sti'l existed
on bo ti sides of the house The Opposition had
alwa\- trrated the pre ent incumbent of the chair
with the u most c urtesj Indeed, ihe leaning of
in* hoi'bo-f} was natuial y towards sustaining
the Ciiatr but when a decision of ihe Chair l* so
outiageous as to caII for tie interference, it was
ce tain that that decision should be either receded
from or reversH
Mr B4YARD «aid as it was his lot to differ
from the Senator from Kentucky with whom he
generally c-tn urred, it became proper for him to
state his reasons for dissen'mg from that Senator's
opiuion, on the  question at issue     He thought
