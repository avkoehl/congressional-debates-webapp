HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-1.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Respectfully forwarded.* Your telegram of 12 m. received. I will await the developments of the day before sending Warren any instruction based on it. Indeed, his orders last night contemplate his making and retaining a lodgment on the railroad.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 18, 1864-1.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have endeavored to ascertain the probable cause of the heavy cannonading last night, but without success. It commenced a little before 2 a. m., on the right of the Eighteenth Corps, by the enemy, and was quickly taken up by all their batteries to our left, and as quickly responded to by ours. The enemy, in the afternoon previous, told the pickets of the Ninth Corps not to be alarmed in the night because they were going to shell the negroes. The probabilities are that they suspected some movement on our part which they thought they might interrupt, or they suspected we were, or had been withdrawing and they would draw our fire. From all I can the casualties on our side are: Ninth Corps, 2 killed, 10 wounded; Eighteenth Corps, 5 killed, 15 wounded; in all, 7 killed, 25 wounded. I have given orders hereafter our batteries are not to open at night unless there is evidence they are able to accomplish something.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
