I think the whole command, including Crook's and the mounted infantry, should move at once to Fayetteville and meet him there. I have notified Crook of the information, and directed him to be ready to move at short notice. Send me orders what to do and what dispositions to make of the command at once.

Major-General THOMAS:

Later information from Colonel Galbraith says he has reliable information to the effect that General Sherman's cavalry drove Wheeler across the river on Wednesday last. He has heard of only half of his force crossing. However, he has scouts out watching, and will report everything he learns.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 24, 1863.

Major General JOSEPH HOOKER, Stevenson:

A dispatch just received from General R. S. Granger says you are turning over the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad to him and withdrawing your troops. For fear you may not have received former orders, the general commanding directs me to repeat the order for you to leave one division of the Twelfth Corps to guard from Murfreesborough to and including Bridgeport. Acknowledge receipt of this order.

By order of Major-General Thomas:

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HEADQUARTER DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Chattanooga, October 24, 1863.

Major General JOSEPH HOOKER, Stevenson:

The general commanding directs that the One hundred and second Ohio, now on the line of the railroad, probably at Tullahoma, be sent at once to Nashville. That as soon as the change can be effected Colonel Coburn's brigade, except the regiment at McMinnville, be concentrated at Murfreesborough, relieving the troops of the Twelfth Corps now there, and that Colonel Coburn's present guard duty be performed by the division of the Twelfth Corps, which previous orders directed you to leave to guard the railroad. That division will be held responsible for the road from Murfreesborough to Bridgeport, including that, post, while Murfreesborough and the railroad north of there will be provided for from other troops. The changes of troops from one station to another can be effected gradually, so as not to leave the road exposed.

By order of Major-General Thomas:

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
