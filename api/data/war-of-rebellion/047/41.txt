To prevent a recurrence of the evil complained of, the Secretary of War directs that you arrest all newspaper correspondents in your command and keep them in confinement at Hilton Head until your operations against Charleston are concluded.

He also authorizes you to impose upon the writers of such letters such punishments as the nature of the case may require.
