SWIFT CREEK, June 15, 1864 - 11.45 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

General Wise reports General Dearing's cavalry driven back on Petersburg, with loss of one piece of artillery. Enemy reported three brigades of infantry and considerable force cavalry, apparently moving toward Baxter and Jerusalem plank roads. He calls for re-enforcements on his whole line. We must now elect between lines of Bermuda Neck and Petersburg. We cannot hold both. Please answer at once.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

SWIFT CREEK, VA., June 15, 1864 - 1 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Hoke's division is ordered to Petersburg; hope it will get there in time. I will hold lines of Bermuda Hundred Neck as long as practicable, but I may have to re-enforce Hoke with Johnson's division, when line would be lost. I advise sending forthwith another strong division to intersection of turnpike and railroad near Port Wathall Junction.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

SWIFT CREEK, June 15, 1864 - 1.45 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Richmond, Va.:

Your telegram of 12 m. received.* I did not ask advice with regard to the movement of troops, but wished to know preference of War Department between Petersburg and lines across Bermuda Hundred Neck, for my guidance, as I fear my present force may prove unequal to hold both.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.

PETERSBURG, VA., June 15, 1864 - 9.11 p. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Re-enforcements not having arrived in time, enemy penetrated lines from Battery 5 to 8, inclusive. Will endeavor to retake them by day-break. I shall order Johnston to this point with all this forces. General Lee must look to the defenses of Drewry's Bluff and the lines across Bermuda Neck, if practicable.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
