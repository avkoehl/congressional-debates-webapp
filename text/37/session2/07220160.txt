Postal Eeform—Mr. Hutehins.
Ho. oi? Reps.
-. The main reason why, in my judgment, these
statistics'show so favorably to Great Britain, is
. in tfao superiority ofher postal system over ours,
"ifcf fates of postage^are so low, and her postal
ftcifities so great, that most of the correspondence
of;her people is transmitted by mail instead of
'tteekiag other channels of transmission; but this
3§mnot bo said as emphatically and truly with
«re|ird to the correspondence of this country. It
' wtU-surely not be asserted that the people of the
'Omted States are less active, less attentive to
business, or less intellectual than the people of
"Qreaf Britain. It wilt not be denied that intelli-
gence and education are more generally diffused
here than in the British Isles.
, If" Congress will adopt a low and uniform rate
of postage that will stimulate correspondence and
accommodate the public with postal facilities, I
can see no substantial reason why our active peo-
ple will not write and send by mail as many let-
tors per annum as passed through the British post
office in I860,to wit: 504,000,000; being 380,000,000
more than passed through our post office during
the same year. The average postage of an inland
letter, (exclusive of official letters; for, as a gen-
eral tiling, they are heavier than private letters,)
according to the official report of the English post
office in 1851, was about one and one eighth of a
penny, or two and a quarter cents our currency,
fey this estimate, which is a fair one, (for many
of the letters sent by mail will weigh more than
half an ounce,) the gross increased revenue to our
post office ptfr annum, from this source alone,
would be £8,550,000. As a question of revenue,
is not the experiment worth trying? Not an in-
stance can he found in the postal history of Groat
Britain or of this country where ail increase in the
rate of postage has resulted in a corresponding
increase of the postal revenues; and, on the con-
trary, not an instance can be found, in any coun-
try where the rate has been reduced, but what the
result has been, in a very brief period, to stimu-
late correspondence largely, and to increase the
■revenue. As t have before stated, there must be
a limit to the reduction with a view to this result;
but 1 contend that limit is below the rates fixed
;in this bill.
I will now briefly explain the principal features
• which this bill proposes to incorporate into our
postal system. I will first remark that there is
nothing new in the bill but what has been suc-
cessfully tested by the Hritish system.
1. UiiiJ'onnily of rate of two 'cents for all dis-
tances.—This t regard all-important to the success
of the system, as it is economical, convenient,
and labor-saving. Where is the necessity or value,
nmincitilly or otherwise, for the two minimum
rates of one and three cents for mail and drop let-
ters, circulars, and other minor articles, when the
medium rate of two cents will give us uniformity,
and produce as much revenue? By adopting a
thtee cent rate for letters, you break the unifoim-
attained by the bill; for three cents is too high
fov drop letters, transient newspapers, and circu-
lars. When the bill was drafted, the rate of letter
postage for over three thousand miles was put at
eight cents, upon the supposition that that rate
would add largely to the revenue. Subsequent
examination of our postal statistics lias fully
satisfied me that this is a mistake; and that the
bill should be amended in this paiticular. There
IS no reason why our cnterpnsing fellow-citizens,
those hardy pioneers who have settled on the Pa-
cific coast, and who have opened to the nations her
golden gates, should be taxed fourfold on their
business-and social correspondence. The num-
ber of letters sent between New Yoik and Cali-
fornia—probably two thirds of the whole corre-
spondence between the Atlantic and Pacific coasts
—in 1860 and ItiGl, was 1,534,928, or an average
of 767,404 letters m one year. Add to this fifty
per cent, for other coirespondencc not through
iNew York, and we have 1,150,000 letters per an-
num to and from California, Oregon, &c. At the
present rate of ten cents per letter, this corre-
spondence produces $115,000 a year. Were this
postage reduced to two cents, and were there not
an increase of a single letter, the reduction of
revenue on the California correspondence would
be $92,000. 1
But we should inevitably have a very large in-
crease On the correspondence between the East
and the far West in consequence of so material a
reduction in the cost. It would be safe, I think,
to assume that correspondence would be tripled
within .two years. This would give an income
from California letters of $69,000, in place of
f115,000, or a falling off of only $46,000 per an-
num. Is it fair, is it just, is it sound national pol-
icy to levy this exorbitant tax on a people whose
productive wealth is so great—the coining of
850,000,000 a year of solid gold out of the dust of
the earth, all of which is essential to our national
revenue, the balance of trade,and our commercial
prosperity—when the financial result of this high
postal charge is not j50,0D0 a year? This extra
tax on the people of our western empire, and the
numerous friends they have left behind them in
the old States, breaks in upon that unifoimity
which is so essential to a good postal system.
To show the useless details and vast compli-
cation of our present postal rates as opposed to
the simplicity, economy, and convenience of one
uniform charge for all the letters and minor arti-
cles that make up forty-nine fiftieths of our mail
matter, the folio wing catalogue is most instructive,
giving side by side the present and the proposed
rates. I copy itfrom an article on " uniform post-
age" in Hunt's Merchants' Magazine for May,
1862:

Is any elaborate argument necessary to show
the absurdity and uselessness of this vast number
ot charges and " extra" charges, when a single
stamp of two cents would pay the postage at once,
without any further trouble or "extra" charge
whatever? I think not.
2. Letter delivery in cities and towns.—This is
a very important feature, of the bill. Our present
mode of postal delivery in cities requires an extra
cliaige on all mail letters delivered by carriers,
furnishes little accommodation to the public, and
produces 110 revenue to the Department. The fol-
lowing table of comparative postal statistics of
L,on(ton and New York, compiled by Mr. Phut*
Miles from official sources, throws a ilood of li^ht
on this question: °

What is meant by ''postal district" in this
table is the space of country accommodated by the
city post office. Many persons not living within
the city limits of London or New York do most of
their correspondence through the city post office.
i invite special attention to these figures, carefully
compiled from official sources. The looafor drop
letters in London number 63,221,000 annually,
while in New York, they are only'1,500,000.
The net profit to the post office department on
local letters in London yearly is §900,000. Net
profit on local letters in New York nothing.! The
postage on local letters delivered in London is two
cents and in New York one cent. Why, it may
be asked, if cheapness stimulates correspondence,
and letters are delivered one half cheaper in New
York than in London, that so many more local
letters are written in the latter than the former
place? The reason is obvious. The letter delivery
in New York does not accommodate the public.
The people are therefore obliged to seek other
channels, private messengers and errand boys, for
the transmission of their local letters. Suppose
the omnibuses on Broadway, instead of running
constantly to accommodate the traveling public
on that great thoroughfare, should only run six
times a day, would the stock in those omnibuses
be valuable? Certainly not, for the public would
be obliged to go on foot or seek other modes of
conveyance. A merchant in London residing
miles from the post office, or the point at which he
wishes a letter delivered, can d-rop it into a letter
pillar or deposit it in a receiving office near his
residence, and by the time a special messenger
could deliver it, it will have reached its destina-
tion, by the magic of the London letter delivery
system. New York is as commercial as London,
in proportion to her area and population,and her
citizen merchants, manufacturers, mechanics, nnd
artisans are as active, intelligent, and enterpi ising
as the same class in London. G ive New Yoi k the
same postal faciintes as London, and she will con-
tribute to the postal revenue as much in propor-
tion to her population as London. New Yoik,
Brooklyn, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Boston, Cin-
cinnati, Chicago, St. Louis and Buffalo, have a
population of a little over 2,500,000. Were the
local correspondence of these cities equal to that
of London, (2,500,000 people,) 63,000,000 letters
annually, the postage would amount, at the rates
proposed in this bill, including- the attendant
printed matter, to the sum of $1,600,000, as fol-
lows:
Local letter    $1,417,500
Local printed matter  -182.500
$1,000.000
This revenue is lost to the Department under
our present miserable system, or rather want of
system of letter delivery in cities. The loss in
time to the public in our cities and towns, by the
ptesent mode of letter delivery is enormous, and
almost beyond the power of accurate estimate. a
distinguished citizen of Massachusetts, then a Rep-
tesentative from that State in Congress, and now
postmaster of Boston, Hon. J. Gh Palfrey, in Feb-
J*««ry, 1849, made an able speech in the House of
Representatives on "postage reform," and upon
the point under consideration, used the following
language: °
And especially there is crying need for a substitution,
ot a svbtctu (or collecting and delivering letteis from boiwe
to house, instead of tlie toolish audenoimous waste os time
and labor now expended in visits to the contra! post office.
