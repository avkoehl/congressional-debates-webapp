HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,July 10, 1864-8.50 a.m.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The following changes have taken place in my line since last report: All the reserve troops have been placed in line to extend my line to the left, taking up the entrenchments vacated by Sixth Corps. I have relieved Sixth Corps picket-line. General Ferrero has reported to me with his division and forms the left of my line, extending nearly to the plank road.

Major-General.

General HUMPHREYS:

The picket officer of the day reports that this morning at daylight the enemy's pickets advanced on the right of General Birney's line, crying out," The Yanks have gone." They were fired upon and a number killed. The firing extended to the right and left. They probably inferred that we had gone from having heard the "marches," boots and saddles," &amp;c., and having seen the fires, caused by burning refuse material, which continued until 3 o'clock. If General Crawford will put in his reserve brigade I can get a brigade. I can get one or two brigades now in reserve for the left, which does not now extend to the plank road.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

Your dispatch received. As material changes will be made in the lines as soon as the redoubts are finished, probably to-morrow, the commanding general considers it unnecessary to make any new disposition of the troops of the Fifth Corps.
