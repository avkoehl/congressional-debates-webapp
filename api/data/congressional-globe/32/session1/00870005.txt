RECEPTION AND ENTERTAINMENT OF.KOS-
SUTH.
Mr. FOOTE, of Mississippi. I beg leave to
notify the Senate that to-morrow", as soon as I
can do so, after the reception of the President's
Message, I shall ask leave to introduce a joint
resolution in relation to the reception and enter-
tainment of Louis Kossuth, Governor of Hun-
gary. I may venture to remark, that f shall do so
in unison with the Administration, and somewhat
at the instance of the Secretary of State, and after
full consultation with as many of my friends in
this body as I have had an opportunity of con-
fering with. I would like to getan informal order
for the printing of this resolution, so that honor-
able gentlemen may have a chance of reading it
and seeing that there is no mischief in it what-
ever; so that it may to-morrow morning be unan-
imously adopted.
By unanimous consent, the resolution was or-
dered to be printed, as follows :
Joint Resolution in relation to the reception and entf r-
M tamment of Louis Kossuth, Governor of Hungary, in
th& United Slates.
Be it, «5'c., That a joint committee of the two Houses of
Congress, to consist of members of the Senate and 
members of the House of Representatives, be appointed by
the presiding officers of the respective Houses to make suit-
able arrangements for the reception of Louis Kossuth, Gov-
ernor of Hungary, on his arrival in the United States, and
to communicate to him assurances of the profound respect
enteitainccl for him by the people of the United States; and
to tender to him, on the part of Congress, and in the name of
the people of the United Stales, the hospitalities of the
Metropolis of the Union.

The Clerk announced that two hundred and

and that there was a quorum present. ^
ELECTION OF SPEAKER. s
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee, moved that the
House proceed to the election of Speaker viva voie;
which motion was agreed to. \
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I believe nom:
nations are now in order?
The Clerk. They are in order.
Mr. CAMPBELL nominated Mr. Steyens, of
Pennsylvania.
Mr. RICHARDSON. I understand that nom-
inations for Speaker are not necessary. .
The Clerk. The gentleman from Illinois is
correct.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Against the will
of the House, then, I am certainly not disposed to
make any nomination. I desire simply to say,
that for one, I shall vote for Linn Botd, of Ken-
tucky, for Speaker—not because he has received
the nomination of a .caucus, but because I know
him to be a sound Democrat, and a tried and
thorough compromise and Union man.
shall vote for him for Speaker- * <. ;
Mr. CARTTER. I desire, to-say that I feel
very happy in concurring with', the' gentljemttn
from Tennessee, [Mr. Jones,] and. shall voAeilpSr
Linn Botd for Speaker, because he'is the nomi-
nee of the Democratic party1. < . "
CAUCUS NOMINATIONS—THE COMPROMISE.
Mr. STANLY. I should be -glad toknowSif
there is any difficulty about the nortinatioii.Be-
tween our friends upon the other side of the
House? I - . v -V-
A Voice: None whatever.
Mr. STANLY. But something is the matter.
A Voice. Oh, we will settle that by a vote.
Mr. STANLY. But I have heard of some
trouble about these compromise matters; and since
the ball has been started,! should be glad if'the
gentleman from Tennessee, [Mr. Jones,}'or the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Cartter,] would give
the country some little information upon this sub-
ject. We want to know how far a coalition which -
has existed elsewhere, is to be brought forward
and sanctioned by the votes of this House.. One
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. STEvfesrsl has
been nominated by a gentleman from Ohio. There,
has been a secession from our ranks on account of
the adoption of the compromise measure^, I want
to know how far the compromise measures have
been repudiated by our friends on the other side
of the House, for I understand they havebeeh re-
pudiated. ;
Mr. SAVAGE. It is not an uncommon thing
for individuals to console themselves in their mis-
fortunes by seeking out the misfortunes'of others.
I imagine that if the gentleman would turn to his
own side of the House, he would find ample need
of consolation. [Laughter.] I am not aware of
any misfortune in our ranks.
[Cries of " Call the roll!" " Call the roll!" from
all parts of the Hall.]
Mr. CAMPBELL. I do not know that it is
proper to discuss the merits of the various-gentle-
men who may be presented as candidates for the
Speakership. I do not design doing so. I desire
simply to say, that as for the gentleman whose
name I have presented to the House, he is as true
a friend to the Union as there is in the Union; and
I believe he is just as good a Whig as can be found
in the Union. As to the compromise measures,
I hope those gentlemen who are so much opposed
to agitation will not bring forward those measures
for discussion so early in the session. I am
against agitation just at this particular time. I do
not want to plunge this House into another revo-
lution such as we had in our efforts to organize the
last Congress. I would suggest, therefore, to the
honorable gentleman from North Carolina, [Mr.
Stanly,] and to the honorable gentleman from
Tennessee, [Mr. J one s,] and to my colleague, [Mr.
Cartter,] that perhaps the less said upon this
matter just now the better. When the time comes,
should gentlemen insist upon agitation, we will be
ready for it. We will take care not to throw the
first stone.
Mr. CARTTER made some remark inaudible
to the Reporter.
Mr. CAMPBELL continued. I have not said
one word in relation to the merits of the compro-
mise measures, because I do not wish to get up
agitation so early in the session. We shall have
enough of it after a while, but I do not think it
prudent to begin now. I hope, therefore, that the
roll will be called.
,'[Cries of "Gall the roll!" "Call the roll'."]
f Mr. BROOKS. The honorable gentleman from
jbennessee [Mr. Sayage] has tauntingly advised
'us Whigs before we proceed to a vote, that instead
of reproaching the Democratic party, we first heal
the differences in our own ranks. It is good ad-
vice: and but. for that advice from the other side
of the House I should not have said a word upon
this occasion, nor have had the opportunity I now
have of informing the gentleman that the breaches
in the Whig party have been healed. 1 now have
the pleasure of informing not only that gentleman,
but all others associated with him in his party
connection, that the Whigs of this Congress as-
sembled this morning in large numbers——
Several Members. How many?
Mr. BROOKS. Enough to give a decided and
emphatic expression for the Whig party 
Cries of " How many were there?"
Mr. BROOKS. There were fifty or sixty pres-
