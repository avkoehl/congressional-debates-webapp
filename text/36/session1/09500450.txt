APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE!
[May 8,
36tii Cong.... 1st Sess.
The Tariff—Mr. Houston.
Ho. of Reps.
For the current fiscal year, terminating 30th
June, 1860, "the Secretary of the Treasury esti-
mated the receipts from customs at §56,000,000; j
and the receipts up to this date fully satisfy me i
that his estimate will be realized, and the law will, I
the present year, exceed the estimate of its friends t
by about $6,000,000. The Secretary estimates ;
for the next fiscal year, ending 30th June, 18G1, ■
$60,000,000; and if nothing occurs to disturb the j
prosperity of the country, no man who will ex- j
amino this subject free from prejudice will von- i
ture to bring that estimate in serious question. |
I have heard much in praise of the law of 1846; j
I concur m giving it praise; it vindicated itself!
most triumphantly, and established for its pro- i
jectors and friends a just claim to wisdom and |
statesmanship ill its enactments. Bat how much j
more revenue was it yielding when it gave place
to the act of 1857 than the latter is now yielding?
The law of 1846 was m operation for about ten
years. The highest yield under it for any one
year was |64,224,190 27, in the year 1854. The
last year of its existence, ending 30th June, 1857,
it yielded §63,875,905 05. Its average yield for
ten years was $50,021,000 93. We reduced the
rates of duty as established by the law of 184C,
because that law was yielding too much revenue,
and now when the law of 1857 is yielding many
millions more than its friends expected, and but
little under the law of 134C, it is proposed by the
protectionists to make the duties much higher than j
they were even under the act of 184G, when all
sides admitted that the receipts were too large. Is 1
it possible that any one can fail to understand this? j
Their object is not an increase of revenue, but \
pr tection. If they wish an increase of revenue,
how do they expect to obtain it > Take their prop-
osition,which is the bill under consideration, and !
what will likely be its yield? The gentleman who
reported it [Mr. Morrill] says:
" After a most patient examination, i feel confident the
importations under this? bill would produce §30,000,000 or*
revenue, and not mote."
If that bo its yield, why change the existing
law, which will yield more than that, with a much
smaller tax upon the people. The Secretary of
the Treasury estimates, as I have already said,
the revenue fur next fiscal year at $60,000,000.
Thus you will see the two estimates arc the same,
while the rate of duty or tax, which the gentle-
man from Ohio [i\lr. Sherman] admits is paid by
the consumer, is much higher 111 the bill under
consideration than in the present law, or the law
of 1846. Then, can any one doubt that the pur-
pose is protection, regardless of revenue? We
all know that the law of 1846, with much lower
duties than those in the proposed bill, yielded
several millions more revenue, at the date of its
repeal, than gentlemen even claim for this bill.
Then, if revenue be the object, why not propose
to reinstate that law, which we all know will yield
enough revenue ? Why make a guess, when you
can make it a certainty ? That law has been tried,
and we know it will yield enough. Why not
take it? If you are candid m saying you seek
revenue, and believe the present law will not give
it, why hesitate to propose one that has been tried,
and yielded on abundance? 1 have no doubt the
present law wiii furnish all we need; and I will
not willingly give it up even for that of 1846 until
I am satisfied to the contrary.
Tiu  friends of this bill estimate that it will yield
$60,000,000, u and not more1 am aware that it
is very difficult to estimate for any new tariff law,
for the reason that we do not always know the
effect it will haveupon commerce: mid especially
is it diilicuU to estimate for thus bill, with itseom-
i plicated duties, made up of ad valorem and spe-
j cilics, introducing the condemned and exploded
! principles of minimunis, square yard, number of
I threads, and othorabsurduies; yet I have a table,
prepared as well, I presume, os it can be done in
advance of the operation of the law, from whrh
it appears that, upon the imports of the year 1859,
this hill will yield $72,113,135 05, being over
$20,000,000 more than the yield under the pwaent
law. Let me ask gentlemen what they propose
to do with $72,113,135 65 per annum J Why
take it out of the pykets of the people ? We do
not need it, and the consumers should not be re-
quired to pay it. But gentlemen say it will only
yield $60,000,000 yearly. Upon what principle
do they make such estimate? No one familiar
|j with the subject will be at a loss to understand
j t how they reduce it so much. They are correct
in making ieduced estimates of its yield, but they
ti fail to go far cnouah. They know the rates of
!j the pending biil are strongly restrictive of im-
j, ports, largely prohibitory; and it is by n restraint
upon commerce that they expect it to yield only
i: £,60,000,000. I have no idea it will yieid that
j; much. I would be witling to stake what little of
|1 reputation I may have that its yield would be
!! millions below that sum, because of its prohibit-
1ory character. Upon the amount of imports in
(■ 1859, as I have already shown, this bill would
ii give$72,113,135 65, while its advocates only claim
11 for it $60,000,000. To reduce it to that sum, your
imports must necessarily be, to a material extent,
; prohibited; your trade abroad cut off and de-
, stroyed. Another very objectionable feature of
': this bill is, that its high duties are mostly on arti-
,; clesof necessity, such as all, whether poor or rich,
I! must have, as shown in the tabic, which I read:
Statement of some of the principal articles imported into the United States during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1859, upon which the duties are increased by
the proposed tariff of Mr. Morrill, and exhibiting the rates and duties prescribed thereby, as compared icith the rates and duties under the tariff act of 1857.

Another objectionable feature of this bill is its '

#8,912,145 of imports, which now pay a duty of I
$434,G57 73, and the articles thus released from
duty are such as do not enter into the general
consumption of the county, but are almost ex-
clusively used by the manufacturers; so that the
|.424,657 73 is, by operation of this bill, (if it shall
become a law,) taken from the Treasury of the
