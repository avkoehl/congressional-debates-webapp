APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

was the fluctuation in the prices of that artic'e af-
ter the National Bank commenced business, that
jn 1820 floor fell to #4 72, the smallest average
price in the Philadelphia maiket since 1790.
Here we find that when the National Bank was
in all its noon of power and fame—in the prospe-
rous golden days of 1830—the prices of produce
were considerably lower than they now are, under
all the hindrance and embarrassment which a sus-
pension of specie payments by the "great regula-
tor" and its attendant satellites was calculated to
produce.
The embarrassment and distress which gentle-
men complain of have been produced, in a great
measure, by the very policy which their own politi-
cal friends have advocated and forced on the coun-
try.
I propose, sir, to examine some of the prominent
causes of this imputed embarrassment and distress;
and, unless I am grossly deceived, or wholly inca-
pable of comprehension, I think I may affirm that
the Administration is in no way responsible far
them. The secret of the pecuniary revulsion which
has fallen on the banks, impaired their credit, and
disconcerted the natural order of trade, lies in
causes over which the General Government could
«xercise no control, without a total prohibition of
all the wise and salutary principles of the Consti-
tution.
It is the province of a considerate mind some-
times to recur as well to fundamenial principles, as
to past events, and to profit by the lessons which
Doth jare calculated to afford. To that wholesome
preliminary of political action I fain would invite
the gentlemen on the other side.
But I cannot anticipate obedience to the invita-
tion. Gentlemen seem desperately engaged in a
struggle for lead and authority in the national
councils; and insist that the spoils of office they
hum to enjoy, are abused and perverted by their
political opponents. In the patriotic pursuit of the
glittering prize, gentlemen are so blinded by preju-
dice and rage that they cannot ste, or seeing, will
not admit, that any thing that is good, praiseworthy,
or honorable, can kbe accomplished by any other
mortal man than the modern Federal Whigs; or
that any calamity, private or national, can fall up*
on the land, without the direct agency or sinister
•onnivance of a Democratic Administration.
However capricious in principle, familiar to the
changes of their party cognomen, and habituated to
«very shifting and occasional expedient of public
policy, no wild bee woos the odors of the morn
with more delight, nor takes a course more direcily
tocthe honeyed hive, than do the Federal Whigs
in their inflexible endeavors after power and place.
The wealth, glory, and stability of the nation
most all be levelled to the miie, that Federal
Whigs may rise npoa the collected ruins.
A little attention, sir, to the condition of our fo-
reign trade for several years past, and a comparison
of £our exports with our imports, will satisfy the
committee that the balance of trade has accumu-
lated against us to a very mjudicous amount.
The reports of the Secretary of the Treasury
show, that from 1820 to 1830 the imports were

Presenting for that period an average balance
of foreign trade against us of three millions four
hundred thousand dollars per annum.
From 1830 to 1838, the imports were #869,780,304
Exports        .... 675,460,384
Making an excess or balance against
ns of         -          -          -          §194,319,920
In eight years, averaging upwards ot twenty-four
millions each year.
What produced this fearful balance against our
foreign, trade?
One of the most direct and efficient causes was
the free and continual issues of paper money,
Which occasioned a rise in the nominal price of
«very commodity among as.
The consequence was th tt the high price of fo-

large amount of commodities, while the high price
of our domestic productions prevented foreigner 
from taking m exchange a large amount oí our
own commodities. As therefore we bought from
foreigners more than they bought from us, they
'   would not take the paper, but the coin of ihe banks.;
I   and they took the coin in such quantities as to
leave the banks without an adequate supply for
banking purposes.
The consequence was, the banks failed, violated
their engagements to the nation, and defrauded their
bill holders. If the affairs of the banks had been
previously well mannaged, the.banks might have
diminished the issue oí notes, callea in a portion
i of their debts, and stopped the exportation of sil-
II   ver and gold.
11 Another cause of this balance ef trade against
us, is to be traced to the prodigal facility wiih which
the various States created public debts, fur the re-
demption of which they pledged bonds and stocks,
which «ere sold abroad at depreciated prices,
! and for what they would bring.
A printed publication, under the authority of
Mr. Flagg, late Comptroller of the State of New
York, shows the debts contracted under the autho-
rity of the different States that have, from 1820 to
1838, resorted to the expedient of borrowing mo-
ney on the credit of their stocks and bonds bear-
ing interest, and redeemable at a distant day.

Making an aggregate of State debts of $170,80 6,277
[ Of which sum #148,226,657 were contracted be-
tween 1830 and 1838; during which period the ex-
cess of imports over expoits swelled to the enor-
mous sum of $194,319,920.
To the amount of thh public debt, created by
j'  the States, may be added the bonds and other liabi-
) i lities which, within andsince the period which I have
[   named, have been issued and sent into foreign mar-
,   kets for the benefit of incorporated   companies;
and which, according to  a recent computation,
swell the grand aggregate of our foreign debt to
#200,000,000.
The ¿security upon which this fearful balance
was suffered to remain unliquidated, was founded
principally on State bond, and stocks, and notes
issued by corporations created by the States. For
the redemption of the principal and interest of such |
bonds and stocks, the faith of the Statrs has been
solemnly pledged. These bonds and stocks are most
iy in the hands of foreigners, but a fair and honest
redemption of them is not, on ihat account, the
less sacred and obligatory.
A public debt of $200,000,000, and an annual
interest of ten or twelve millions more, with the
unavoidable pecuniary means annually to be raided
to discharge the currenf and ordinary obligations
of the State and Federal Governmen's will, ior ma-
ny years to come, tax the property and industry of
the people, and weaken the resources of every State
which has improvidently borrowed capital to in-
vest in expensive and unproductive schemes.
I have already stated that from 1830 to 1838,
there was an average excess of imports over ex-
ports of twenty-four millions of dollars, every year.
Through the instrumentality of bankers and attor-
neys, our State bends and stocks reached the hands
of foreign capitalists, who paid for them principal-
ly in promiscuous merchandise, wh le the foreign
gold and silver, which we received in part pay-
ment, only stimulated the spirit of extravagance .
and speculation; and were quickly reinvested again
to bk at the excess of our impoi tations.                       |
From 1820 to 1830, the exportation  of gold
from the United States amounted to #70,932,660
The importation of gold into the

And the aggregate excess, for eight
years, amounts to        -             -    #192,610,935
Whoever, sir, will examine the origin and pro-
gress of our foreign debt, will perceive that ihey
have closely indicated ihe constantly growing ex-
cess of our imports over our exports, since the
year 1820.
From 1820 to 1830, the amount of our State
debts was only #26,000,000; at which period the
balance or excess, of imports over exports was only
#37,662,959. And here we reach the fatal period
at which State legislation began unwisely to pam-
per the extravagancs of the day; when State bonds
and State stocks were con'inually and profusely
issued for public objects of imaginary utility.
From 1830 to 1838, the stocks and bonds, issued
under the authori'y of State Legislatures, amount-
ed to #148,000,000; during which period our im-
ports exceeded oui exports by #192,610,935.
i Private and incorporated companies, reckless in-
dividuals, and sovereign States, all indulged m the
1 heedless enterprise of a speculative cupidity. Thu
pervading spirit multiplied banks, and covered ihe
land with paper money.
In 1820, there were in the United S'ates 308
banks, with a capital of #137,110,611, whereof
#19,000,000 were in specie.
In 1830, there were in the United States 330
banks, wiih a capital oí #145,192,263; whereof
#22,114,917 were in specie.
In 1838, there weie in the United States 829
banks, with a capital of #317,636,778; whereof
#35,184,112 were in specie.
There is, Mr. Chairman, another comparison of
cotemporaneous events to which it may not be in-
appropriate to allude.
From 1820 to 1830, the sales of the public lands
amounted to the sum of #13 300,826.
From 1830 to 1838, #69 917,824.
In the single j ear of 1836, fie sales of the pubic
lands amounted to the sum of #25,167,833.
Here we see that the effect of the issue and sale
of State bone's and stocks, and of corporate liabili-
ties of various sorts, furni.hed ihe means of feed-
ing and sustaining the inordinate speculative spint
of the age; and which led to an exchange of mil-
lions of acres of the most valuable public domain
for depreciated bank note , till the (anions specie
circular of 1837, rrea urably checked the general
mischief, by requiring payment for the public
lands to be made in com.
But io deeply seated was the passion of specu-
lation, that even after the banks suspended in 1837,
the specie payments for publ.c lands exceeded, in
'hat very year, #7,000,000.
Again, 6ir, trom 1820 to 1830, there was not
one barrel of flour, or one bushel of wheat, im-
ported into the United States. Whereas, from
1830 to 1838, we imported into the United States
5,643,075 bushels of wheat.
This shows that the spirit of speculation had so
greatly diverted the labor of the country from the
cultivation of the soil, that gome portion of our fo-
reign debt was created even for the necessaries of
life.
Yet, sir, with all this startling evidence before ns,
gentlemen can find nothm  in the legislation of the
various States, in the unbridled avarice of banking
institutions, nor in the geneial, wide-spread prodi-
gality of the age, which could disturb the whole-
some regularity of thatforeign trade with which oar
own domestic prcspeuty ba* btcome so intimately
blended.
No, sir, this loved disturbance of the country's
weal mast be traced to a Democratic President; or
