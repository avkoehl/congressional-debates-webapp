of the same denomination can not circulate
together It is iu Voin, then, to attempt to widen
the eu dilation of gold and silver by any other
means than by the suppression of bank notes of the
lower denominations But, not now to dwell on
this view of the subject, (which I have fully deve-
loped and enforced elsewhere,) I maintain that the
collection of the public revenue m gold and silver,
while the common currency of the country consis's
of bank paper, instead of «. idemng the circulation of
those metals would have the effect of taking them
out of genei al circulation altogether In the remark?
I have already made, I think it has been satisfacto-
rily shown that the necessary effect of this policy
would be to cause gold and silver to bear a pre-
mium Bearing a premium, they would not cir-
culate as currency at all, but would be at once con-
verte 1 into sn article of merchand se The public
debtor would buy them of the broker to pay his
dues to the Government, and when paid out to the
public creditor he would go and sell them again to
tne broker Instead of entering into circulation,
a'l of them that were seen would be restricted to
tus narrow round of traffic, while the great mass
of them would be withdrawn from public \ie\v as
well as use
Then, sir, as to the tendency of this policy to
"mciease the safety of ban! paper " would you
increase the safctv of bank paper by abstract ng
the fund ¡or its redemption' Yet such \ ould be
the plain operation of this | obey The Secretary
of the Trcasuiy has referred to the condition of the
Treasury m 1834 as affording a general average
to illustrate the opera ion of the ne * financial sys-
tem he pioposes In looking at the Treasury state-
ments for that j ear I find that tne average amount
of pubhe moneys on deposite in the city of "S'ew
York, during that year, was about five million,
v.hile the whole amount of specie in tne banks ot
the city was about two million Taking this as a
iair average for that city, what would be the influ-
ence of this new policy of collecting the public dues
in gold and silver on the safely of bank papei there'1
Where would you get *he five million of specie to
meet this demand for the public revenue'1 It is
evident the banks nould be drained by it of their
stock of the precious metals, and ihe community
wou'd thus be deprived of the seeurity on wh ch
they relied for the soundness of the bank paper
held by them Ttie " improvement of the general
currency," then, which the President anticipates as
the result of the policy he proposes, would, unless
the principles heretofore received as incontestable
truths on the subject of the currency be utier fal-
lacies, amount to this that the precious metals
would no longer form apart of the general circula-
tion , that they wouid cease to be currency, and be-
come mere articles of merchandise, to be obtained
only at a premium , and that the specie basis, on
which the soundness and safety of bank papei so
mainly depend, would henceforward, to a great
extent, be withdrawn and monopolized by the Go-
vernment
But it has been said, and I regret to perceive that
the idea is countenanced by the high authority of
the President, that the general currency of the
country is a matter with which this Government
his nothing to do, that its duties are confined to the
exercise oí the coinage powei, and the collection of
its own revenues m gold and silver, and that the
general circulating medium of ihe count'y must be
entirely abandoned to the separate and often con-
flicting control of the individual States Now, <yr,
as my opinion differs alike from this view of the
subject, and from that urged a few days ago by the
Senator from Massachusetts, (Mr Weoster,) I beg
leave to state briefly what they are The whole
history of the formation of the Constitution, as well
as the internal evidence of its provisions, prove,
beyond question, that the frameis of that instru-
ment intended that there should le a c mmoi cur-
rency for the Union, and n( t " as many diffei nt
currencies as there are States " The}, doubtless,
believed that that currency would consist almost
entirely of gold and s Iver There were but two

currency of the country, tlwn they foresaw the two
gieat discoveries of the age—steamboats and rail-
road —which have had so extraordinary an influ-
ence on the w ealth «md resources of the country
Believing that gold and silver would continue to
constitute the currency of Ihe country, they placed
the " regu'ation" of that currency express]} under
the control of Congress, and took it away, in terms
equally expi ess, from the States But, while they
did this, they left with the States (foi the omiss on
to take it aw ay amounted to the same thing) the
power of mcoiporatmg bpnkmg institution^ In
the general and extensive exercise of that power by
the States, the issues of the banks have come to
take the place of gold and sfher, ?nd to foim the
actual currency of the countiy In the practical
working of our system, then, a state of things has
grown up entirely unforeseen by the founders of
tne Constitution This Government has no au-
thority, by force of law, to put an end to that state
of things, nor is it desirable, considering the many
and indisputable conveniences of a sound paper
currency, in the present advanced stage of com-
merce and civil zation, to destroy it altogethei
But, as the original design and intention of the Con-
stitution certainly «as that there should be a com-
mon eunency for the Union, it is incumbent upon
Congress, m the exeicise of the powers delegated to it,
to do all i' can to fulfil that design, and to render
the actual currency of the country as sound, as
equal, i>nd as nearly equivalent to gold and silver,
as possible
Tris duty is essential to the harmony and friendly
intercourse of the Stales, and i^, indeed, intimately
connected with al' the objects of a commrn Govern-
ment wh ch led to th= establishment of the Consti-
tution But tms duty is to be measured by the ex
tent of the powers which have been delegated to
Cc ngi ess, ft r it mus' alw avs b< bi i ne m mind that
this Co\ernment can exercise no other powti than
such as hav e been specifically delegated to it Now
w hat are those powers m regard to the question of
the currency 1 The Senator from Massachusetts
(Mr Webster) argued, the other day, as if the
Constitution had gi\ en to Congress a substantive
and plenary power to " regulate the currency," eo
nomme, and inferred from thence the power to esta-
blish a national bank to regulate the issues of the
State banks, which form the actual currency of the
country But, in the fiist place, the Constitution
has not delegated to Congress any gener?l or sub-
stantive power to " regulate the cuirency," nor has
it, anywhere, either by express giant, or necessiry
implication, given to Congress the power to create
a banking corporation What, then, are the pow-
ers it has vested in Congress on the subject of the
currency t In the first place, it gives to Congress
" the power to com money and regulate the value
thereof " But since the precious metals form so
small a part of the actual circulation of the coun-
try, this power, however important in itself, cm
exert no controlling influence on the gene-
lal currency We then find that the Constitution
gives to Congress the power " to 'ay and collect
taxes, duties, &c , to pav tre debts, &c , of the Uni-
ted States" Trom the large amount ot tne re-
ceipts and disbursements of the Government, this
power is susceptible of an extensive and importart
bearing on the gsneral currency of the country In
the exercise of u, it is incumbent on Congress to
make it instrumental to secure to the whole coun
try, as far as possible, the benefits of a sound and
equal currency, equivalent eveiy where to specie
It may be so managed, by receiving the paper and
employing the agency of the State banks in the
fiscal optra'ions of the Government, under certain
salutary res notions and conditions, as to impart to
the issues of tho^e banks, forming the actual cur-
rency of the country, some of the most essential
qualities of a *ound, stable, and equal circulating
medium But if, on the other hand, this, ine den-
tal contiol, through the revenue oower of the Go-
vernment o\er the actual eunency of the coun n
is to be aban ioned, and that currenc} b  regulated
exclusively, as is now proposed, to the separate and
conflicting legislation of the individual States, our
whole monetary system, affecting so widely and
deeply the interests of society, must run into wild
dtsoider and confusion, and one of the highest ob-

jects of the Constitution be nullified and defeated
This, sir, was the doctrine steadily maintained
by the late administration From the removal of
the deposites from the Bank of the United Stales,
down to the close of that admimstiation, it was
constantly put forth, m bold lelief, m the measages
of the President, and the reports of the Secretary of
the Treasury, as well as in the speeches of its
leading friends in this and the other branch of Con-
giess The obligation of the General Government
to watch over the general cuirency, and to secure
fo the w ho e country, as far as possiole, ihe benefit
of a circulating medium that should be sound and
of equal value, was distinctly recognised and ad-
mitted , and it was coitended that this object could
be as effectually accomplished thiough the State
banks, as by the ase cy of any national incorpora-
tion The management of the revenue through
those institutions, wis to be the instrument by
which the end w as to be accomplished, and thepar-
licul ir means relied on was to make a suppression
of the small notes, and some other reforms in the
currency, the conditions of a deposite of the public
funds in the banks, and of the receivability of their
notes m payment of the public dues By the em-
ployment of these means, the late President, m"his
last pnnual message but one to Congress, said,
" w e should soon gain, m the piace of the Bank of
the United States, a practical reform in the whole,
paper sy stem of the country ," and, looking forward
to the ultimate suppression of all bank notes below
twenty dolíais as the result of this policy, he hailed
it with enthusiastic patuotism, as " forming an
era in the h story of our country, which would be
dwelt upon with delight by eveiy true friend of its
liberty and independence " The present Chief
Mag strife, n his celebrated letter to a member of
the other hou«e, speal mg of this same policy,
aid " no hing but a fathful prosecution of it by
the General Government and the States is neces-
saiy to place us on a footing of equal ty with other
nations," enjoying, in the highest degree, the ad-
vantages of a stable and uniform currency. Tbaii
this I was a smceie convert, and am still I still
believe that it is the duty of this Government—a
duty from which it can not free itself without be-
traying one of the highest objects of the Union—
to exercise a supeimtendence, m all constitutional
modes ovei the general currency, so as to secuie to
the vhole countiy a sound, stable, and, as nearly
as may be, uniform medium of exchange, and, to
use the language of the la e President of the United
States, that " the management of ihe public reve-
nues, through the State institutions, may, and
ought to be, made auxiliary" to the accomplish-
ment of this great end
'I he measure which I nov offer to the considera-
tion of the Senate, and which received the almost ,
unanimous sanction of both houses of Congress
at the last session, is the result of these views.
Permit me, for a few moments, to inquire what
would be its practical effects on the general con-
dition of the currency, if the policy it holds out
should be earned into full effect by the co-Opera-
tion of the States and the General Government, as
I think it w opM be if sustained here It contem-
plates the gradual supprev-icn, after given periods,
of all o ink notes under ten and twenty dollars re-
spectiv elj Supposing this last limit at ¿med, how
would the eunency of the country then stand under
i's operation t Aocoiding to a calculation I sub-
mitted last winter, founded on authentic data, it
wouid, m that case, be constituted enarlj as the
currency of England is , that is^neaily one-half of
the precious metals, and the residue of convertible
paper Woul 1 not such a constitution of the cur-
rent as this accomirodr'e all the wants of the
