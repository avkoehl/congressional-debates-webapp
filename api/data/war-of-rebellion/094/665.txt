General G. T. BEAUREGARD:

(Care of General Cobb, Macon, Ga.)

The following received.*

Strange dispatch. It would be well to recommend to Department that General Brags be sent at once to relieve Smith, and organize and administer trans-Mississippi, and General R. Taylor to command troops. This would be a strong concentration and secure prompt action. Otherwise, we shall not be able to open spring campaign.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

A good lieutenant-general should be sent here at once, to command the corps now commanded by Major-General Cheatham. I have no one to recommend for the position.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

Major-General Cheatham made a failure on the 30th of November, which will be a lesson to him. I think it best he should remain in his position for the present. I withdraw my telegrams of yesterday and to-day on this subject.
