GALLATIN, December 19, 1862.

Lieutenant-Colonel GARESCHE:

It is now certain that the enemy is at Hartsville in some force; how large, we have not been able to ascertain. This information was first communicated by negroes, and afterward confirmed by Colonel Wolford's scouts, who report them in considerable force, with infantry, cavalry, and artillery. With the present disposition of our forces, we could not resist a large force of the enemy. We need some more cavalry to protect that region of country. This point is far more important than is generally supposed. There is now no longer any doubt in my mind as to an attack at some point in this region. It will certainly be made, unless prevented by the presence of quite a large force. They will not come without a force sufficiently strong to carry the place, with its present defenses.

Brigadier-General FRY,

Commanding:

Your report as to Morgan's movements is confirmed. He has started with from 5,000 to 6,000 cavalry, for the purpose of breaking the railroad. Be on your guard.

Brigadier-General FRY,

Gallatin:

Have you plenty of scouts out in direction of Lebanon? Shall send strong reconnaissance that will hurt somebody on the Silver Springs road to-morrow? Could you not assemble your forces and attack them, if only cavalry, at Hartsville by 7 o'clock to-morrow morning?

Brig. General R. S. GRANGER,

Bowling Green:

Yes; the force at Mitchellsville should go to Buck Lodge or come to you. How many troops has Bruce? Is he intrenched? If not, by moving to Clarksville at once, he will find intrenchments, in which he can hold himself safe. You have force enough to whip anything that will come there, and Morgan too. Aim to find his encampments and surprise them.

Major-General.
