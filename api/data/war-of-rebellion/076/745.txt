[AUGUST 31, 1864.-For roster of troops in the Military Division of the Mississippi, not serving in the Atlanta campaign, see Vol. XXXIX, Part II.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,In the Field, Smith's House, near crossing of Mill Creek,

September 1, 1864-12 m.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: General Stanely is at Morrow's Station. He reports to me that all the road to this rear, as far as his camp of last night, has been destroyed. I have ordered him to concentrate there, and to move right down upon Jonesborough. He will connect with General Davis' left, which will make our line complete. My skirmish line has moved forward now and driven the enemy from the ridge bordering Mill Creek on the south.

Respectfully, yours,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
