of the enemy, and by no means to abandon their works. This order was handsomely carried out by the brigade and regimental commanders on this occasion, and led to the most beneficial results.

In pursuance with this order, Colonel Harriman, commanding First Brigade of this division, and posted on the left of the Third Brigade, ordered up the One hundred and ninth New York and Thirty-seventh Wisconsin Volunteers to report to General McLaughlen, but, as General McLaughlen could not be found, these two regiments were formed in line in rear of the skirmishers already mentioned and entrenched themselves to resist the large force moving down the rear of the line toward Haskell. The enemy was now confronted on this flank by the troops in Fort Haskell and the skirmishers of the One hundredth Pennsylvania and Third Maryland. The enemy made three advances on Haskell, all of which were gloriously repulsed. Meantime several ineffectual attempts were made by General Hartranft with a portion of his division to regain Fort Stedman by an advance on the rear of that work, but very soon after the repulse of the enemy at Fort Haskell the Second Brigade, of Hartranft's division, came up and formed on his left, the left of this brigade stretching toward Haskell. On the appearance of this new line the enemy, already repulsed on both flanks and considerably demoralized by the fire of our well-served artillery, were seen breaking away in small detachments from Stedman back to their own lines. This was quickly perceived by our troops on-all sides. Major Maxwell, One hundredth Pennsylvania, with the skirmishers of his regiment, under Captains Johnson and Book, and those of the Third Maryland, under Captain Carter, immediately started along the trenches toward Stedman, capturing a large number of prisoners in the bomb-proofs from Battery Numbers 12 to Battery Numbers 10. The first Union colors on the recaptured fort were planted there by Sergeant Oliver, One hundredth Pennsylvania, who captured a stand of rebel colors, at the same point and at the same time, with his own hands.

Hartranft's line advanced rapidly, enveloping the rear of the works. The Seventeenth Michigan, on the extreme right, dashed forward and gained the trenches lately occupied by the Fifty-seventh Massachusetts but now held by the enemy, capturing prisoners on that side. The retreat of the enemy was soon cut off by the troops of this division gaining the rear of the main body along the parapet of the works, and a large number of prisoners and some colors were captured by the troops of both divisions. One thousand and five prisoners, besides some of the wounded, fell into the hands of my own command, also seven stand of the enemy's colors, together with one of our own flag-staffs recaptured.

It was found on regaining our works that the enemy, while they held possession of them, were not able to carry off or effect, any damage on our artillery, which they temporarily held and partially used against Battery Numbers 9 and Fort Haskell. They carried one Coehorn mortar over the parapet, but it was regained, and not the least damage was inflicted on any of the guns or gun carriages. No colors or guns were lost by us.

The following are the names of the captors of enemy's colors in this division: Captain John L. Johnson, Company D, One hundredth Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers; Captain Joseph F. Carter,* Third Maryland Battalion Veteran Volunteers; Sergt. Major C. H. Pinkham, Fifty-seventh Massachusetts Volunteers; Color-Sergt. Charles Oliver,* Company M, One hundredth Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers; Private Joseph B. Chambers,* Company F, One hundredth Pennsylvania Veteran Volun-
