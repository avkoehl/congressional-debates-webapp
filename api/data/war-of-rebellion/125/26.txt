CIRCULAR WAR DEPT., ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, No. 3. Washington, January 12, 1864.

The following instructions concerning credits on the quotas of States and towns are furnished for the information and guidance of all concerned:

Recruits will be credited to the localities from which they received local bounties, provided the muster-in rolls show them enlisted and mustered in as of the said localities. The muster-in rolls us show the facts of the case, and will be the evidence for awarding the credits.

Veteran in service, re-enlisting, will be credited to the localities to which the re-enlistment and muster-in rolls show them as belonging. Therefore, until veterans have been remustered, it cannot be determined to what particular locality they will be credited.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
