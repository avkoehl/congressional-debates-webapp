make the people believe that only thirty thousand dollars had
been collected after a perfect crusade through the whole coun
try, and he was opposed to this indirect mode of taxation for
the benefit of individuals He would vote with the boldest
hearts here to erect a suitable monument to the memory of the
Father of his Countiy—he would vote a million of dollars, but
he considered it a reproach to the country to commence the

this country are involved, for they have lent the high sanction of
their names to encourage this undeitakmg It was an abuse of

moie than all the íest ot the Union? In that pioportion, there
must have been moie than a million made up lie hoped that
those who felt themselves aggrieved, would give to the public a
