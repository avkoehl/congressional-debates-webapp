two companies of Third Cavalry, and suspended issuing commissions therein. I would suggest that the two companies of cavalry of Third be assigned-Captain Reeves to the Eighth Infantry, Captain Conger to the Ninth Infantry, and also a company forming on Kanawha under Captain Young, to the Eleventh Infantry, as mounted infantry. With your permission I will commission them, or by an order of the Department assigning them to those regiments will recall their commissions and commission as assigned. Captain Baggs' company is the only independent acceptance. His company has been highly serviceable and should in my opinion be kept as they are-free to act.

The manner in which the mustering into U. S. service has been done has caused embarrassment, because of the uncertainty existing in regard to whose jurisdiction parts of companies are, and the only way to get the time and manner of muster in will be through the Pay Department, from their rolls, so that of the forces mentioned in the statement inclosed I cannot state how many have been transferred to the Federal Government, but presume nearly all. All regiments and companies complete certainly so, the incomplete companies being the uncertain forces referred to.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

H. J. SAMUELS,

Adjutant-General of Virginia.

REMARKS-The Twelfth and Thirteenth are intended for East Virginia regiments; part East Virginia brigade. Captain Reeve's and Captain Conger's companies, cavalry, eighty-five men each, commissioned as Third Cavalry Regiment; Lieutenant Young, forty men, same regiment; Captain John Baggs' "independent acceptance," fifty-three men (Snake Hunters), scouts, and effective men. The Seventh, Eighth, and Eleventh Regiments will probably complete by 10th of February; the residue by 1st of March, except the East Virginia regiments, of which we have no returns.
