HEADQUARTERS, Near Chattanooga, September 26, 1863.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: May I take the liberty to advise you of our condition and our wants? On the 20th instant, after a very severe battle, we gained a complete and glorious victory-the most complete victory of the war, except, perhaps, the first Manassas. On the morning of the 21st General Bragg asked my opinion as to our best course. I suggested at once to strike at Burnside, and if he made his escape to march upon Rosecrans' communication in rear of Nashville. He seemed to adopt the suggestion, and gave the order to march at 4 o'clock in the afternoon. The Right Wing of the army marched some 8 or 10 miles, my command following the next day at daylight. I was halted at the crossing of the Chickamauga, and on the night of the 22nd the army was ordered to march for Chattanooga,
