COLUMBUS, OHIO, September 26, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The urgent call for troops in Kentucky compels me to send six or eight regiments before their organization is entirely completed. They have the men and arms, and are ready for service, but wooing to the want of mustering officer many of the muster-rolls are unfinished, and the field and staff and many of the company officers have not been mustered in, and under your Order Numbers 66 cannot take command and draw pay. This will create great embarrassment unless you authorize me to give in all such cases effective commission of proper date.

W. DENNISON,

Governor of Ohio.

MY DEAR GENERAL: Inclosed I send you the letters of the two French princes accepting their commissions.* You will perceive by an order indorsed on the envelope by the President that the oath in these two cases is to be dispensed with.

Very truly, yours,
