HDQRS. SECOND DIV., TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS, Chattanooga, October 1, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded.

I am unable to give the works a personal inspection, and therefore forward the report of Captain Steele, topographical engineer of my staff.

JOHN M. PALMER,Major-General, Commanding.

HDQRS. RESERVE CORPS, ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND, Chattanooga, Tenn., October 1, 1863.

Major General GORDON GRANGER,

Reserve Corps, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The communication herewith inclosed was received from the department headquarters about half an hour ago. I sent an order for Colonel McCook to report as required. A messenger has just arrived from Colonel McCook, bringing me a letter in reference to brigade matters. I make the following extract therefrom, which partly answers General Garfield's inquiry:

I have heard nothing of General Crook. Hope he succeeded in repulsing the enemy, for a march of 50 miles will not be very pleasant this bad day. Nothing new.

The messenger left Colonel McCook at 11 a.m. Please bring General Garfield's letter back to the office with you; must file it.

Very respectfully,

J. S. FULLERTON,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Inclosure.]

Major General GORDON GRANGER

The general commanding directs you to ascertain whether Colonel McCook has gone to the support of General Crook, and, if so, what force he left at the mouth of Chickamauga Creek. He must give notice when he moves from his present position, and also what force he leaves. Ascertain what news he has from up the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

CHATTANOOGA, October 1, 1863.

General MORGAN,

Stevenson, Ala.:

No news from you of railroad matters or arrival of troops. Send full and frequent reports of all that transpires. Our road must be made as safe as possible.
