Brigadier General JAMES B. FRY,

Prov. March General United States, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that Colonel Bailey, by direction of Governor Smith, of Rhode Island, called at this office on the 28th instant for the purpose of looking up the credits which have been given to that State under call of July 18, 1864, and to be informed upon what basis the quota of that State was arrived at under the call of December 19, 1864.

The principle of apportioning the quota was fully explained, and Colonel Bailey expressed himself perfectly satisfied, not only with the manner in which we arrived at the quota, but also with the credits given under call of July 18, 1864, the excess of which, after satisfying that call, was taken into account in assigning the quota under call of December 19, 1864.

The records of this office (Enrollment Branch) give an excess over all calls prior to July 18, 1864, of 628 more than was claimed by the State authorities, and this excess has been credited.

Respectfully submitted.

GEO. E. SCOTT,

Captain, Veteran Reserve Corps.
