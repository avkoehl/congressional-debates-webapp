Governor JOHN A. ANDREW,

Boston, Mass.:

DEAR SIR: I have the honor to forward you, inclosed herewith, the plan of the organization of the volunteers for three years, or during the war.* Six regiments are assigned to your State, making, in addition to the two regiments of three-months' militia already called for, eight regiments. It is important to reduce rather than enlarge this number, and in no event to exceed it. Let me earnestly recommend to you, therefore, to call for no more than eight regiments, of which six only are serve for three years, or during the war, and if more are already called for, to reduce the number by discharge. In making the quota of three- years' men, you will please act in concert with the mustering officers sent to your State, who will represent this Department.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

(Same to Governors of other States, May 16, 1861, for their several quotas, as follows:

Connecticut.-One regiment for three years, or the war, in addition to the two regiments of three-months' militia already called for.

Illinois.-Six regiments in addition to six three-months' regiments.

Indiana.-Four regiments in addition to six three-months' regiments.

Iowa.-Two regiments in addition to one three-months' regiment.
