in a deep hollow. On the other side is a rifle-pit near the creek. To the left and at a distance of 300 yards from the creek is a strong lunette, connected with the other works to our right. This is on the crest of the hill. Nothing further was discovered of importance, and no enemy found on the southern side of the creek.

Major General F. STEELE,

Commanding U. S. Forces before Blakely, Ala.:

The enemy had in Blakely yesterday about 2,700 men. They have been re-enforced to-day probably to the extent of 1,200 or 1,500 men. With your own force, Veatch's division in reserve, and Garrard's on your left, I do not think they can trouble you seriously, but it will be necessary to guard your right flank closely and have your reserves well in hand. They are superior in artillery, and your entrenchments should be made as perfect as possible. Keep your wagon park well back toward O. Sibley's.

Major General F. STEELE:

We shall open on Spanish Fort with all the batteries we have in position at 5 o'clock this afternoon, and will probably have a 30-pounder rifle battery in position below Blakely early to-morrow morning.

Major General F. STEELE,

Blakely:

Contract your lines as much as possible, keeping very strong reserves. As soon as the guns can be had they will be forwarded to you, and you will be enabled to act offensively. Inform us of any movements there. Spanish Fort Alexis will be bombarded this p.m. from 5 to 7.

P. JOS. OSTERHAUS.

Major General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: May I use Veatch's division to complete the investment of Blakely? The line is so extensive that I shall require a portion of his division for this purpose, leaving strong reserves.

Very respectfully,

F. STEELE,

Major-General, Commanding.
