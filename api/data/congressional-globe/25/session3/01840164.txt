ously signed by citizens residing on the northern

gesting the propriety of authorizing the Secre-
tary of the Treasury to construct a steam rev-

asked might be íeferred to the Committee on Com-
merce
Mi KING remarked that the Secietary of the
Treasury had aheady the powei, if he deemed it
proper to exercise it, to construct a steamboat for
the collection of the revenue; but inasmuch as it
would involve some additional expense, it might
| be desaable for Congress to expiess an opinion
, as to the piopiiety of the measure, and tins he
would endeavor to obtain at some not very re
mote period

SLAVERY QUESTION.
Mr MORRIS submitted a resolution directing
the Committee on the Judiciary to inquire into
certain matters pertaining to the institution of
slavery m the States and Terntoiies, and to re-
poit thereon to the Senate; which he moved
should be laid on the table and ordered to be
printed
Mr HUBBARD said he hoped that the Sen-
ate would not, at this late period of the session,
be called upon to act upon the resolution just pre-
sented by the Senator from Ohio. This subject
has been befoie repeatedly brought to the notice
of both Houses of Congiess He was entnely
opposed to the consideiation of this resolution at
this time He could not believe that the Senate
would undettake to discuss this agitating ques-
tion at this penod of its session He had, ever
since he had been a member of the Senate, op-
posed all action upon the subject of abolishing
slavery in the Dtstnct of Columbia He had íe-
peatedly expressed Ins views upon this matter,
and he had mvauably urged it upon the Senate
that it was « mallei of pohcij, if not of duly, to let
this whole subject alone. At the other end of
this Capitol, his friend, one of the Representa-
tives from the State he had the honoi in pait to
repiesent, felt it to be his duty to offei sundiy-
resolutions m relation to the subject of slavoiy.
These resolutions have been iully discussed
thiough the public piess, and notwithstanding
then author has received the most umneasuied
abuse fiom paiticulai public journals, yet he wis
free to say that he (Mi H ) most sinceiely
concuned with his fuend in every sentiment
exptesscd by him in those resolutions, and he
might add that a gieat majonty of the constitu-
ents of his friend, he had leason to believe, weie
prepared fully to sustain him in the couise lie
had puisuedupon tlnssubject With these opin-
ions he could not consent to consider the subject
at thi° time He was now, as he had heretofore
been, wholly opposed to the consideration of this
mattei He would not, unsolicited by those
whose interests are to be affected by tins pro-
ceeding, act in any way upon the subject cm-
biaced in the resolution of the Stnatoi from
Ohio
Mi   CLAY, of Alabama, mquued if it would
' not be in oidi r to move that the íesolution should
not be ifceived
The PRESIDENT stated that the rule of the
Senate, diiicting that icsolutions submitted by
membeis of that body should be ieceived, was
posmvt, and did not admit of any question.
Senatois who ob)ected to the íesolution would
have an oppoitunity to monow, when it came up
foi consideiation, tomo\i for its rejection, that it
might be laid on the table, or foi its indefinite
postponement
Mi FOSTLR expiessed his suipuse that the
Senate 11 id not the powei by an instantaneous!
•vote to lefuse to leceive the motion
Mt CXtt \Y, of Alabama, said that in analogous
cises leave was asked and granted before propo-
sitions could be submitted to the Senate, and in-
stanced the case of a Senatoi who wislu d to m-
ttoduce a bill In that case leave was asked,and
the question   piopounded was, should 1. ave be
i gianted, and the power of gianting leave implies
the powei of refusing it This pnnciple, he
thought, was also applicable to the reception of
i evolutions, and that the Senate had powei to íe-
ject any pioposition they thought pioper It is
possible to conceive acasewheie a pioposition
might be submitted which was abusive oi libelous
of the Senate itself Would they have no power
in such a case to leject it' He meiely put this
to lllustiate Ins position, that the Senate was not
bound to entertain eveiy proposition submitted
I to it.    As the question would agam come up to-
