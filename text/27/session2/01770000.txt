Mr CLIFFORD hoped, he said, tut the gentleman fiom

that proposed by him foi the consideration of the bill Many
of the State L°gislatures n iw m session weie anxiously wai'mg
the action of Confess on in ¡3 important question And if an
early disposition was not made oi it an extid session oí those
Legiblatures would become m Impensable, or the subject must
necessarily go ovei for one yeat fro n the regular time of elec

Mr C J INGCRSOLL wa&undeutood to say tlat he hid

for eaily action upon 1 Batit w*s neces aiy that the papers

Mr W C TOiENSON adid tha ' is o i,,ee 1 making the mo
tion was no' only to elect a joneial understinhn* on the pait
of all the States, so as to meet on some harmonious giound, but
to ensure speedy action When the sentiments ol each o| ihe
Sutes hdd been ascerlainwl through such a committee, the
House would receive such a report as would meet the eenti
ments of all parts of the House, and thus preventa long and te
diousdiscussion, whereas, as the matter now stood,there wou d
be almost an interminable debate ¡such a con mittee would
have all the light before them, which would enable them *o em
body the opinions and sentiments of all the States and to pre
sent a. bill on which prompt action could be had, and it would
b*1 a great economy of time
Mr WLLLER make a few remarks m oppo&ition t"> it,
principally upon the giound that too much time would be
consumed by it, and consequently the I egislatures of se
veral of the States would be compelled to have an extra se&
sion
Mr BIDL CK said, if the gentlemin from Maiyland [Mr
JoHN30N]had eubmit'ed such rrtJPos tion at the commence
mentof the session, he (Mr B ) would have agree 1 to it Rut
it seemed to him that, actirg under instructions fiom theLe
gtslature of Pennsylvania, he and his colleagues would be ne
glectmg their duty if they ('id not oppose the motion now He
felt bound, under the circumstances, to vote to make the bill
the special orderofthe day iui as eailyaday asthe requisite
printing could be executed
Mr W C JOHNSON desned to inquire of the gentleman
from Pemisylvana [Mr" Bidlack] wlie*her the Legislature of
that State had instructed him to support the ratio which these
lect committee hadiust reported
Mr BIDLACK replied, most assuredly not The Le
gislature had only ms ructed him and his colleagues to
obiect to any unnecessary delay, and to bung the mattei to
a close, that it might be submitted to the trtates as soon as pos
sible
Mi CUSHING said that there was no foundation for the ob
jection that the State Legislatui es would he compelled to have
extra sessions, if this hill was not speedily actedon Theie
was a more material question, involved, and that was that the
representation of the fetales should beappoitioned on acouect
basis, and that object was not to be accomplished by limned ac
tion He deprecated the iaea that this, the ereatest bill of the
session, and irrepeaiabje for ten yediá mu t necessarily be
pa&sed in a few days and that, U0, perhaps under theie tuc
tions of the previous question bet au^e some oi the States roi-mt
otherwise have to putoff then emotions for anoihei year Mr
C eonsideied Hfo hehisduty to íesist the passage oí this bill
m its present shape by all honorable parliamentary mean^
and if the motion of thegentleman from Marylan 1 should not
prevail, he would move the commitment of it to a Committee oí
thQ Whole Hou e If the gentleman fiom Pennsv Ivan a sup
posed that there was to be an expeditious action on this bill and
that it was to be passed m us piesent shape to gratify the Lc
gislature of Pennsylvania, he was mistaken fie hoped the
House would take m consideiation the impoitance of
having a correct basis of repie=entation and with this end in
view accede to the proposition of the gentleman from Mary
land
Mr CIIPFORD did not wish to be understood as beirg in
favoi of the bill as it then stood, because he wished to ha\e a
speedy action on it On the contrary hp was oppo ed to it,
and would join with the gentleman frumMa ->aciiiineit'*m endea
vonng to see justice done to several of the S'ates which weie
not treated fairly by it But (said Mi C ) M the ! ii! he refer
red and reported on as often as gentlemen pleaded, i! mustcomp
back to the House at last, and there be di^cu^ed at length and
finally moulde 1 into such a shape aa the majority should dp
cide on He was opposed to the commitment solely <rn the
ground that delay would be occasioned by it without obtaining
a report that would be satisfactory to the Hous" He agreed
with thegentleman from Massachusetts that the bill was an
important one, and deserved to be well con ideted 1 nd whpn
it should come before the House he turned an opportunity
would be allowed for an ample discusión
Mr C BROWN observed that the question would be settled,
not by a committee, but by votes He was opposed io a com
mument, because no possible advantage o mid be gamed by
it It would be impo sible for a committee to fix up >n a ratio
of representation that would please e\ei y b dy *md theie fore
he eonsideied it best to have that unuei eonsidertd m the
House where it must finally be settle 1
Mr JOHNSON modified hn m >tnn si ¿stop ovilethat
the committeeshould have powet to sit dumg the 'essiom of
the House
Mr PICKENS spoke in favor of the motion of the g^nde
man from Maryland, and evpressed his ii^appiobati m of the
bill, as unfau and unpjst in it* p^oviotons fit v uu diather

the
tee of twenty six members, a ratio could not be made satisfac-
tory to the whole number, and it would then probably be pro-
posed to commit toa committeeof two or three, or perhaps-of
all the members from each State He was one of the committee
who reported this bill, and he beloved it would be found? that
the ratio left a smaller aggregate fraction than any other ratio
reported by the Secretary of ¡state, and was as near equah when
they looked at the different sections and interests of thecoun-
tiy, as could be made «ome of the State legislatures were
now in session and if, by coming to a vote and bringing up this
matter immediately, these States could be saved a called ses-
sion, it would be desirable He did not advance tins argument
as conclusive for hasty action but as entitled to some weight
A report irom a committee of twenty six members would not
diminish debate, would save no time, and would come no nearer
to a satisfactory conclusion than that now made
Mr RHETT advocated the motion, contending that it was
proper to give the smaller States, m matters qf this kind, as
much influence upon the committee as the larger State , and
by this mode thatjuatice would be done to all
Mr WISE mquned what would be the effect of the previous
question—-if it would not cut off the motion of the gentleman
from Maryland? To which the Speaker replying in the affir-
mative, Mr W said that the only way to cut off this debate
was by general consent He thought they had had enough de
bate on all sides, and withoutgivmg his opinion either way^he
called the yeas and nays on the proposition of the gentleman
fr >m Maryland, and he hoped the House would now consent to
takethequestion without further debate
Mr STUART of Illinois said-they would have to settle the
matter bycompiomise at last, and it would have to go into
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union, and be de-
cided by a majority of the House He moved to refer the bill
to 1! e ( ommittea of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr FERRIS opposed thfi reference to the committee of
twenty six, and held that the bill should be taken up and acted
upon m such a manner that each State might hav© an equal
voice, m proportion to its populat on
[Ct íes of * question, question "]
Mr PENDLETON said that the Legislature of Ohio had
urged the necessity of speedy action upon this subject, and he
should suppoit the )_ropot>ition of the gentlema  from Mary
land, because sucha committee, 1 epresentmg all the interests
of the country, Would be moie likely to harmonize the opinions
of all, and because this reference would be the most direct and
speedy process of bunging about the desirable result of settling
this important matter
Mr J G FLOYt , m buef remarks, very indistinctly heard,
was understood to advocate the reference to tha Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union, as affoiding an opportu-
nity for full discussion on a subject of so great importance,
Mr PROFPIT advocated the same reference
Mr WISE again appealed to the House to let the yeas and
nays be taken upon the motion of the gentleman from Mary-
land
Mr HOI MES advocated the motion of the gentleman from
Maiyland, and contended that such a committee was calculated
to harmonize all the interests of the country in the settlement
of this question
Mr W C lOIINSONsaidhe wished to disabuse the minds
of some gentlemen who supposed that he had offered this pro-
position to give the small States any advantage here He did
not make any imputation upon the large States of this Union
The couise proposed was not novel, it would ettect justiceand
expedite business and by it the voice of everv State would he
heard in committee
[Cries of "question, question "]
I he SPEAKER said that the first question would be on com*
ranting the bill to the Committeeof the Whola on the state of
the Union
On this question the yeas and nays were asked, but, not being
ordered by the House, the vote was taken by tellers, who re
ported 105 in the affirmative and 75 in the negative
By this vote, the reference having been made to the Com
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union, the other mo
tions weie suspended
Mr EVERE1T then ronevved the motion to pnm 3,000 ex
tra coi ieb of t lie report and bil 1
Which motion after a few remarks byMessis EVERETT,
