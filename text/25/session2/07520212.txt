ot Kentucky ten to one more favorable to her now
than then. Yet this Senate is to be lectured, and
the peop'e of the United States to be terrified, with
a tale oí the rum of these exchanges, brought
about b ' the mi*rule of a senseless, wicked, ím-
practieaole, and outlandish Administration Such
is tht re«u't, the same m exchanges as in com-
mer p and in every thing else, the country mconi-
p uablv ¡ eiter off than it ever was before And
jet giavt Senatoi , or Senators who ought to be

their faces for the expiesaion of wo, attune their

I «ill gr?nt you, continued Mr B that do-
mestic txdianers are deranged al present,—much
deranged, but not so much so as in 1826, and w hy
are *hpy deranged now? Because specie pa) inents
are suspended let specie payments be resumed, and
domestic exchanges instantly tegulale themselves,
«inri e fleet tht íegulation upon the simple and eter-
Jiai principle of the expense of freight and msur-
sneem we tiansporlation of metallic money lhe
freight and insurance of silver, between any two
extreme points in the United States, is 2 pel cent,
and lhal it the fair exchange on siher between ihe
extremities ot the U non The exchange on gold
is less than half what it is on silvei, the height be-
ing so much less, and, m addition to all other argu-
ments m ía\or oí a gold currency, that oí being the
best reguUtui of exchange, is one of those which
presents used to the mind of every political ocono-
imst
Mi B w euld malte a ftw obsei vations upon tins
subject ol domestic exchanges It was a subject
on which cveiybod) had got to talking within a
few }ears past, and which «as now thrust into
•very aignment upon the question oí currency and
finance All this has grown up since the Bank.of
the United States had undertaken to regulate the e
exchanges More had been said and written on
this subject smce Mr Biddle became president ol
the National Bank than in two hundred years be-
fore, more m fact than had bten said upon it since
the day that John Cabot first came m sight of the
North Ameiioan coasl And why' Because m the
administration of thai bank, immediately after
Mr. Chev<"> left it, commenced the abuse and pu-
version of the business of exchange, which was
soon imitated by local 1 .inks, until it has now be
come a mean*- of extorting usury, transcending
all oiher means oí extorticn, and brought to bear
upon people who «i^h to borrow money, and not
to sell bills, and m<n\ of whom never heard of a
hill of exchange until they learnt thatit was theonly
way in which roonev Ci old begotontofa bank The
Legislature of Indiana hasjustmade examinations
upon this •ub.ectwn thsh iw the nature of iheabu e,
but the practice of it was inconsiderable in that
State compared to whai it was in other places The
retu'is ef the uepisile banks and of the Bank of
the Un tee! Siates s o\v the extent of the prat .ice
and refe r ng to the iast oí these returns made be-
fo t, the suspension of specie pa) ments, and the
mass of e"e" i gs in ibe^e bills, and their excessive
disproportioi < ordu ary loans, become . mipies-
sively striking Í cou d name a bank, an inienoi
one, noi in a great cuj, nor even on a gieat nvti,
in which the pj'chase ol bills was {,690,000, while
the loins in the o'd v av, on nole^, were but «s4 728
and 34 cenf '
[Mr Blcha\/n and othe,. Senators heie asked
fj, the name oí the bank |
Mr H said his object was to expose a general
¡ vUi'c,«nd/i t to exhibit paiticular instances, but
as t le nam*, c 1 thi baok was called for, he w ould
g ve it w th tut icai e of the ) oung Senator from
(OhoFMr Axlin] it was the bank in the town of
Ins i stuoce, Chilhcolhe But why mention par-
x r Siar a-.tani.ee where the practice is gei aa!1 The
icturriH o' lhp Bank of the United States show that
twenty rrH mihions vere often out m elomestic
"bills oi «"Y^nge, the last returns of the deposite
hai> «, bel or  they suspended, showed that they had
loi'y-iuu millions out in that way, nine of them
only h*j ivjcnty-tiro millions in these bilk, a 4 m
looking ovei the column of suspended debts, it is
seen that default m payment clneflv occurred on
this description of debts Much of this is an abuse
of exchange Much of it is a meie meide of cover-
ing usurious loans A citizen is farced to give a
bill when he only wants to borrow, il he got the
money as a loan on his note, he would pay nothing
but mteiest, bulge ting it on a bill he has topa} ex-
change in addition to interest, and then commis-
sions beside> Where the citizen is obliged to hai e
the money, the tank can put the exchange at what
it pleases, and so practice extoition and usury to
any extent that it is willing This business, as an
abuse, began with the Bank of the United Stiie-^
under the administration of Mi Luidle It \ is
one of my original objections to that bank lis
blanches weie engines for piactismg this abuse,
and its own friends weie among the first that ever
complained to me rbont it In the lcform of the
banking sjstem to Ihe necessity of which the pub-
lic mind is now waking up, this abuse of the busi-
ness of domestic exchanges is enutled lo the hrst
notice It is a vasts)stem of usiuy, extoition and
oppiession ol the community, a total perversion ol
the business of a bank, ami a souice of enormous
and illicit gams, enabling them, aftei dividing vast
profits, to givi to thtn presidents and cashiers, in
many instances, salanes tianscending those of our
Heads ot D( paitinents, Vioe-Piesidcnt, and Chief
Justice of the Supiem" Court of the Unitpd States
Mr B then aelvei led io the rum of prices, which
had figuied so laigely m gentlemen's speeeh s on
the calamines ol Ihe cuuntiy Pioperty, pioduce,
labor—everything, accoidin" to them, was now
without juice Put how «as it in the fine limes
of Mi Adams's admintstidtion ? ( omp-te ihe
pn< es of the two penods Pork, then $1 2& per
handled, in tie wtsum country, uheit, some
30 odd cents per bushel, flour, j¡,3 a hairel cott in,
8 oi 9 cents a pound , and even thing else in ih 
same proportion The people íomembii all tin,
and read with astonishment the distie s harán" irs
which go forth ironi this floor The) know v y
well tint all prices are betlei now, even when
leduced to the specie stindaid, thin they weie in
the time of thp national bank, and under th  Peric-
ial Administraron They hue memoiy, and c n
lecollect ten or iwehe ye-ais back Memory s
the lowest atuibule oí the mind It belongs even
to irrational animals—to cattle And yet ihe Fede-
ral gentlemen do not s em to know that the people
have mcrnorj, much less reason and judgment,
and here is the fault, or the misfoitune, of the gen-
til men of the Federal paity They believe they
monopolize all the intelligence t f Ihe country , and,
by consequence that the pet pie know nothing, anil
will haie to believe all they h< r and, there-
upon, thev tell them most mcred ble things Now
this belief of a mon poly of all the mlellisence ex
tant, would be a very sweet eonce t lo in lulge in
pnvaHv,  r e\en to point a Baechinalian son?, or
21 ice i barbecue speech or to swell the exultati >n
ol midnighl oijfir , but it i, fatal to ait upon it in
the business of hie "Ihe fate ot the panic makers
of 18J3, should warn tbem of that' when eiciy
panic making candidate for the Presidency, mstei I
ol kilhnp Jacksi n and Van Buion killed himself
off of the list ol candidates1 And w hen the lug of
uai came, they were found to be, what the broken
bank notes aie in the Treasury,—an unavailable
fund' So mi) it t e again The people h ive me-
nioi), and ktii wledge, ind rea on, and judgment,
and it will not do ler politicians to t ct them as
wanton boys do }oung robins, when they throw
them g-avel m place of bread The people know
their own condition, and the) see through ihe con-
due t of othei s T*o farmers w ho were selling ther
produce in 1826 for Ihe one third, the one-half, or
the three-fourths of what they are getting for it now
will not believe in the ruin of prices with which ]-o-
hticians assa ' their cars
Mr B finished th  comparison, or rati er the
contrasts, between the year of Republican ruin, and
the pel od of Fedtral pto<penly, with the expression
of bis confident benef that the fallacy of all the
gentlemen's lamen'ations had heen completely
shown There was no rum, but in their own ima-
ginations The }car 1837, though not equal in the
general activity (f business to the bloated over-
action of 3836, was yei transcendently superior to
any year of Mr Adams's administration Making
a due allow anee for an mcre?se of population, ami
Ihe superiority was still fal beyond that increase
Hai ing \ indicated General Jackson's Admmis-
Iration from the imputation of having brought rum
upon the country, Mr B proceeded to notice soma
of the wars which he was charged with waging
upon some pub'ic institutions, and some branches
ot industry     lie y\ as charged by two Senator  on
this floor [Me--sis TALXMADGr and Clay] with hav-
ing made  war upon the late Bank ot the United
Si-itts, and one of these Senators [Mr Clay] had
e haif id this wai   to  the base  motive ol íevenge,
because he toutd not succeed in his attempts to se-
duce ibis vutuous institution into the field of poli-
ties,  and  into  the support of his own political
\iews     The  first remaik which I have to make
upon thi*. imputed war, ib upon the new ideaxvhich
it presents ot the right oí the bank to be continued
in Us existence, when to  oppose that continuation
of existence is deemed a violation of that nght, and
a commencement of hostilities upon the institution
Geneial Jackson made no mo\ement against the
existing chatter of the late bank, he made no at-
tempt to impan, or to oestioy, the existing charter
Ihe extent < f his acnon  w..s   to lecimmend to
Congiess the non-itntyyal of the charter, and, af-
terwaids, to disapprove tbe new charter which Con-
gios had granted    This was  the extent of his
acti n—directed against a non-existent, and not
against    an    existing    charier      According   to
ihe Bepublican  reading  ot the Constitution,   the
Piesident had a >/g/<(   to do   these things    nay
more   that it was his duty  io  make  this reeom-
mendd on, and to express  this disapproval, if he
thought the Oi nsutution, or ihe public good, forbid
ih< fulure existe nee of the bank     He had a clear
right,   nnd r  the Cc nsutution, to do what he did,
bii   iccoiu oa to ihe Fedti   1 reading of ihe Consti-
tuí i n   isexluliid   b\    tins objee i n, he  had no
ueh ri^oi   but v lsgin'ly ef I  wlest. violenc , and
vi lge I wai of on ihi institution, boih m the recom-
irend itii n,   in I in ti e exercise of the veto     This
i   the fan inference result ng from the accusation'
ciioh ísihepiogiess of anii-repubhcan ideasamong
ns' i leas which go to invent a moneyed corpora-
ti n with a rigMml ciaim to a perpetuity of exis-
tence, and  to stigmati/e as u>ai the constifutional
exercise of Executive eights and duties.
With these remarks, to show the progress among
us of ideas towards the r yal doctrine of legitima-
cy I come to the mam inquiry—the truth of the
charge liseli Is it true that General Jackson nnde
w ar upe n ihe Bank of the United States? Is it true
tint lit was in favor of that institution, and only
turned igamst it aflei his clecuon to ihe Presiden-
cy, and after he hid filled in anatiempt lo convert
it into a pi iitic 1 machine, to subserve his own po-
litical puiposis"! These are the questions which
aie now to be answered, and, happily, they will le-
ceive answers n h ch w ill consign ihe charges to the
h w est place in Ihe deepest aby s of political calum-
nc< These oh r^esfirst crept into da) light at the
yeto session of 1842 and attained iheir full form
and sh-ipe at the fimous puncsession of 1833—'34
In loin us mees they cm mated di ectly from he
Bank ol the Un tedStalcsi' ilf, an 1 in the matured
form which die) received m 1833, in a report of a
committee of that Bank approved by ti e majority
of its directory, they imposed that, immediately af-
ter the eli nation of Gen Jackson to the Presidency, a
meeting was held, of the pimciipal chiefs, U con-

a combined ijfm< to lender the Bank sKtwtUfnS

u vei) p  iic, an I vciy susctplible of pioof, if
t ic e v it an) tru h m it No proof, however, has
ever been attempted by those who made it, and no
other speoiticction under it, but the fort) times ex-
p'oded misrepresentation about Jeremiah Mason,
the president of the Portsmouth branch bank The
cabinet meeting, and the application for the re-
moval of Mr Mason, are fixed for the spring of 1829;
and as the whole attempted seduction, or destrua-
tion, of the Bank, was then planned, and as far ai
