Your regret at the failure oí my effort to obtain an interview

be greaier than my own I could have expíame 1 to you more
fully the causes which have m ei vened to delay the completion

"Washington February 11 1S42
' Dear Sir I must express my surprise at some of the re
marks, contain  d in yours ofyesterday, more especially the ap
piehensions you express that official harmony between theap

'guilty custom house officers and other accompi ces ' I leave
the remark without comment
"Nor can I do les3 than express my regret that you have found
it necessary to couple the ¡ ame ol Mr "Webster with a conspi
racy 'to destroy you m my estimation,' aproceedure which, if
it have existence in any quaiter, has not come to my knowl

word of disparagement of you to me, nor am I aware of his

Mr UNDFRWOOD, m concluding his remarks, moved to
amend the motion to print by adding thereto an amendment,
which, after seveial modifications, was read as follows
' But, in p-inting the message and accompanying documents,
this House dt es not intend to approve or sanction the institu
tion of this commission, it being the opinion of this House that
the Piesident has no rightful authority to appoint and commia
sion ofhceis to investigate abuses, or topi ocuie information for
the President to act upon, and to compensate such officeis at
public expense without authority exprés ly given by law "
Mr PROrriT obseived that aremaikable change had taken
place m the opinions of members of that House since the ter
mination of the laH Fresi lential election He remembered
welt when this commission was first instituted and then all t! e
Whig members of Congress and all the leading Whig papersm
the coimtiy, lauded the President to the skies for instituting this
commission, as they did General Hainson for instituting the
com mis ion m this cuy [\lr Unbfrwoo  here said ' So
mu(.hihewoi«e] Well, then, why did not ihe gentleman, or
bimeof his inends, at the extra session offei a resolution call
ir g on the Piesident for his authority for instituting this com
mission? A íesolution of this nature wa^ offered, and the Pies-
ident answered it, sending his reasons for what he had done,
and giving a« his authouty the clause in the Constitution under
which he acted Ml P recollected very well the day when
the answer to thisiesolution was brought in and read at th.%
Clerk's table, and everybody acquiesced in the justice of the
reasons given by he President for his conduc 1 he gentleman
found no fault then, nor did he at the extra session Why
dil he not at the extr.i se=¡s10n find fault with, and ca
vil at, this commission? Why did hu not cad on the
President then to stop ji Why did he not then declaie
tint it was illegal? Mr P guessed the reason very well
At that Mnie no quarM had taken place between the President
and the great Whig party Then it was all ri?ht, then the
President was discharging a high duty to bis country Now st
wosallwiong, and he was violating the Constitution Whv
was no objection made when the PresidentNamwerto the reso
UUion was received?   Not one single person at that time was
found to rise in hw place and object to the grounds laid down by
the President for instituting the commission He would auk if
the House had treated Mr Poindexter properly? Had they
tieated the President properly? and had the debates on thi*
question been conducted properly? No Previous to the pa-
pers being laid before the House, they were prej udicmg the pub-
lic mind in lelation to them—telling what they contain, without
know)n«wkat they are, and talking of rumors, and this was
called debating in the House oí Representatives ^^^J^81
did the gentleman from Kentucky say? Why, that the Whig
party had committed a great blunder in ordering the printing
of Mr Poindexter's report This, Mr P thought himself, for
it was impossible for the committee to have read and un-
derstood it before they made it a pait of their report
With regard to this report, what were the facts connected
with it? "Why, theauihontyot the Speaker was called for, to
lorce Mr Poindexter to give this report to the committee The
subpoena was dated on the 27th of last month, and on the 28th—
the veiy next day—a repoit of 360 pages was laid before the
Hou-e One week befoi e the order ot ihe Sptaker w Governor
Poindexter, thitreport was 11 the possession of the committee;
and one (.ay before, it was in the possession of the President It
was handed m to the Secie.ary of the Treasury on the 12th of
April withdrawn for the purpese of bemgeorrected, and not re-
turned till the 20t!, ind on the very same day, and before it
was given to the Pie ident, the oi der was issued to Mr Pomdei-
tei to bnrg it before the committee, and on bis refusal, the
Speaker issued his suhpeena on the 27th The repoit was,
tlere'bre, in the possession of the committee one week before
the order was issued, and one day toefoieit was in possession
of the Piesident And we have had speeches (said Mr P)
sentoit to the country cen^uimg the President for withholding
it fiom CongiesSj with a det gn to screen Mr Curtis
He was as anxious (Mr P said) as anybody to have thia
leport printed, but he was arxious, also, to speak on it, and
explain the action of the P-esident in íegard to it The Previ-
ous question, however, cut off the debate, and prevented the
friends of the Presi ent from making any explanation to set
aside the imputations against him Who was it that voted for
the previous question? Not this side of the House, (said Mr.
P,) but the gentleman from Kentucky and his friends
Mr P then replied at length to Mi Underwood's argument
m relation to the power of the President to institute the com-
mission, and contended that he had both the legal and consti-
tutional right to do eo
Mr STANLY said, before he went into the remarks he m
tended to submit he had a word or two to say to the gentleman
fiom Indiana, [Mr Proffit ] That gentleman had expressed
great surprise that the Committee on Expenditures should have
produced to the House the letter, an exuact of which was read
to (he House Now he wanted to know whether there was any
more hat in in the committee's obtaining a knowledge of this
lettei than in the gentleman's obtaining a like knowledge of the
very same paper? The gentleman spoke of it in a manner
which showed him to have got at its conten s in seme way.
The committee had a legitimate mode of obtaining a copy of
it having been armed by the House with power to send for per-
sons and papers, touching ma ters belonging to their department
of public duty They had not tome into the poises ion of thia
paper as early, by some vi eek* a^ the gentleman and his friends.
The gentleman said there was no difference between the report
sent to the commitree and that sent to the President How diá
he know this? The othei day the House were told, tx cathedra,
that theie was a difference between them It was a new doc-
trne that the possession of papers by a committee exempted
the Pr sident from all further responsibility m regard to the
subject to which they relate! Because a committee had got
info their hands a letter (he was about to say an insolent letter)
of the President's, charging the existence of a cabal at this end
of the avenue (he won Jeied which of the cabals he meant—
that of the Locofocos, or that of his own peculiar friends here'i)
therefoie the President was to be discharged from the entire
duty of correcting publ c abuses, and recommending great
measures of public policy ' In what a poor, mean, childish,
spiteful attitude did this present the Chief Magistrate of such
a nation'
Mr PROrFIT here entered into an explanation, qualifying
what he had before said
Mr SIANLY said he wasquite willing the gentleman should
qualify is far as he hked The gentleman now said that the
extmption of responsibility on the part of the President, and its
transfer to Congre-s, was to continue only until the President
got back the paper* sent to the House f but the gentleman had
not said so before , neither did the President bay so m his com
mumcation
Mr S would now turn to a different matter
I endeavored (said he) to ob am the floor immediately after
the gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wi^e] concluded I wanted
H but ten minutes, but the estimable gentleman from Kentucky
[Mr Underwood] saw fit to deny me an act of courtesy seldom
refused by ihe Hduse But,sir,Iam satisfied I was not ma
humor to have said what I had to say in a mild or modera'o
waj 1 am generally easily provoked, I fear, by the assump-
tion of audacious insolence, and probably more provoked than
I should be
The gentleman from Virginia seemed to be writhing under
the consciousness that he had a desperately bad cause to defend
and as he had no arguments or proofa to offer to the House, he
must content himself with violent gesticulation and immodest
asseverations
If the Committee on Public Expenditures had not been tin-
grac ously assailed, I shou'd have ieemed any thing said on
■Saturday by the gentleman from Virginia as unworthy of spe
cial notice from ine lam notsute whether much he said was
intended to hp applied io any individual yet it looked like it m
a portion of the lemark ! to which I shall leply
OntheSthof May, 1792 Mr Fitzsimmons from the commit-
tee appointed to inquire roto the causes of the failure of the late
expedition under Major Geneial St Clair reported that the
committee had according to ordei, proc°eded to examine all
the papers furnished by the Executive Department relative
thereto sundry papers and accounts furnished by the Treasury
and War Departments wuh explanations of the same by tfte
head1} rf those departmpnts in person, to hear the testimony
of witnesses upon oath, and general remarks by General St
Clair upon the facts established by the whole evidence and
that,asthe,esult of their inquiries, the committee had agreed
to the following report                                                         ■
