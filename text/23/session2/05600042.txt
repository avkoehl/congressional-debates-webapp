42                                       THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                       December 16,
Mr WEBSTER said he did not understand [
whether the subject mattei of the present reso- j
lution was foi an appioprittion to improve the
Wabash, 01 whether it was the resolution sub-
mitted some days ago by the honorable membei,
[Mr Tipton,] which directed an inquny, by a
committee, into the expediency of making a poit
of entry high up on the Wabash
[The resolution was again read at Mr  W 's
request ]
Mr W  resumed     That «solution, as Ite un-
derstood it, was for the purpose of removing the
* lish a character for ti uth and %ci acity among the
'people vf Indiana, before they will lake his word
' against one they have known long, andhnown well
'The writer of the aiticlerefeiredto has mistaken
'his man, if he thinks that I can be lashed into
' silence, for the power of the press, nor no othei
'power, can intimidate 01 will keep me silent
'while the interest of Indiana is at stake, and in
'this case of the Wabash bill I contend that
'justice has not been meted out to her '
"We ha\e maikcd in italics the passages in
the above to which we would invoke the att* ntion
of the public It will be seen that Mi Tu i on
makes a question of veiacity with us, which he
refeis to its decision We most cheerfully submit
ouisehes to its judgment, and will agree to stand
forever branded as a calumniator, if a single
honest man in the country shall say that, in the
article to which Mr Tipton alluded in the Senate,
there is one false chaigc brought against him, or
anything like abuse
" We give below the whole article on which
the Senator from Indiana has based the charge,
that we have ' DtvoTgD thrff or four of its
(the Globe's) long columns in abusing him'—
and we peremptorily deny, that theie is a single
line in that aiticle, or that we e\er wrote any
other article m relation to Mr Tipton, which
will justify his assoition On the contrary, it
will bt seen that, although m his circular Ik has
insinuatid a strong impeachment of the Piesi
dent's motives m r< fusing Ins signatuie to the
Wabash bill, yet, in our leply, which was in
tended to vindicate the Chief Magistiatc fiom
the aspersions of the Senator, we caiefully ab-
stained fiom making any rcmaik whic h could be
construid into ritihition, 01 savonng, in the
slightest deguo, of vindictive íetort
"As Gcntial Tipton has so wantonly and
unjustly assailed us on the floor of the Senate, as
having abused him, and of violating tiuth in
giving vent to the bad feeling which induced such
a course, he will pardon us foi stating some cn-
cumstanees which, we trust, will satisfy Mi
JTipton that our disposition towards, him has,
been directly the reverse of that imputed.
" Mi. 1 in on was for many years an Indian
agent He has acqun ed a gi eat estate in the lands
obtained by treaties from the Indians, while he
held his agency These lands he upon the
Wabash, and m the neighboihoodof the route of
the canal, through which the Senatoi proposes to
unite the navigation of the Lakes with that of the
Mississippi One of the Representatives of Indi
ana had icsolved to exhibit charges against Mr
Tipton. We entertained so good an opinion of
Mr Tipton as to bclie-ve him incapable of the
wrong imputed, anirroterested ourselves person-
ally to prevent the publication of the contemplat-
ed accusation against him We still hope that
there is some mistake in the grounds upon which
the gentleman to whom we have alluded intended
to rest his charges, but when we find Mr Tipton
constitutional objections urged by the President I
against the appropnation by Congress foi the
improvement of that river He did notpiopooe
to argue the question involved m the objection at
this time, though he pioposcd to do so when the
question should come up He would, however,
only íemark that hedid not compiehend,if Con-
giess did not possess the constitutional power to
improve the navigation of a stream, how the po wei
todo so could be acquned by first establishing a
port of entry upon the stream As to the present
resolution, he thought theie could be no objection
ready to assail oui press without cause, to grati-
ly the malignity of the Opposition m the Senate,
and evidently with a view to conciliate their sup-
port to a measure calculated to advance the value
of his  lands, we must confess that we feel our
faith in him somewhit diminished     What will j
not a man do, who is íeady, without provocation, |
to saenfice a friend to  the Moloch opposition, to |
induce them to pander to his own personal in-
terests ?
"But Mi Tipton is ready to appeal to the
ambition, as well as the malice, of the Opposition
leaders, to cany his measure in the Senate
" 'This subject of impiovingour nveis cannot
' rest here     The people should take it into their I
' own hands, and, in selecting a successor for the I
1 present incumbent, before they cast their votes,
' they should asceitaniwhethei hei« for or against
' internal  improvement      No,   sir,  that is  top
'bioad a term, it can  be  explained  away, 01
' construed to mean anything 01 nothing, they
' should know whether the candidates are for or I
' against improving the navigation of our rivers,
' and I aver that no men holding the opposite doctrine
' need expect one fourth of our votes '
" Mi  Tipton having thus, in effect, promised
tin ee fourths of the State of Indiana to some can-
didate for the Presidency in favor of 'impioving
the navigation of our ra>ei<!,'Mi  Webstfr in
stantly takes him at his word, and responds
"' With regai d to the i f solution undci considcr-
' ation, he had no objection to its adoption He had
' no mme doubt of the right oj Congiess to improve
' the navigation of the Wabash, than to appi opnate
' money foi the Delawaie b> eakwatei, jor the un-
' piovemeiit of Boston haibor, to ei ect Jortifications, ,
(to improve a harboi ml alee Enc,oi to build a light-
' house at the mouth of the Bahze
"So, it seems that the log-iollmg system of
yoting away money laised by taxes on the people
geneially, to secuie the influence of paiticular
sections or States, is to be íesumed, under the
auspices of Mcssis WrissTkR and Tipton This
looks like a wedding ' ' '
" With one further íemark, we dismiss the
subject    Mi   Tipton says
" * Jill other rivers haie been improved except the
' Wabash, while bills for that liver are vetoed ot with
' held '
" Is this tiue# We deny it positn ely   The ap-
pi opuations applied under the direction of Piesi- '
dent Jackson have all been confined to streams I
leading to ports of entry or delivery     Mr Tip- ,
ton instances the Monongahek as one to which
an appropnation has been made, and on which
no poit of entry has been established     It is true i
that an appropnation^was put at the disposal of I
the President, authonzing him to lay it out in I
impioving the Ohio, Mississippi, and Mononga- l
hela     He exerted the discretion given him in the
act, and applied it on the Ohio and Mississippi— I
and exclusively  below the ports of entry   on |
each."
to it He voted hst year for the bill making the
appropnation to impio\e the Wabash and he
entertained no moie doubt about the constitution il
power of Congress to do so, than he did of the
powoi to construct a bie ikwatei at the mouth of
the Delawaie—to elect foiuftcationb—toimpiove
Boston harbor, oi the harbors in Lake Ene He
had no sciuplcs whatevei ibout it He thought
last ycal that the people of Indiana had clauiib,
and theiefoie he voted for the bill And if the
honorable gentleman thought he had any píos
pect of obtaining the passage of a law for the pur-
pose, he would support it igam He (Mr W )
thought there was no íeasonable piospect of
success, so long as the councils of the nation
were so much divided as they were at present on
this subject
Mr TIPTON made a few other remarks, after
which, the resolution was adopted
