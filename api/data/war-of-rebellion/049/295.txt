BEVERLY FORD,

October 12, 1863-9. 50 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

No infantry or artillery discernable opposite the ford. Quite a large force of cavalry massed opposite to the right of where they were grazing this morning early, Dr. Green's house. They seem to be concentrating at this point and in rear of it in the woods.

HOLLAND,

Signal Officer.

P. S. - The ridge this side of Brandy Station has some force upon it. That which can be seen appears to be cavalry and a battery.
