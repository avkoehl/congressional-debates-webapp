DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, February 8, 1862.

B. T. HALLETT, Esq., Boston.

SIR: I have received your note* of the 6th instant accompanied by a copy of a letter read in Faneuil Hall to an assemblage convened for the purpose of urging the release of hostages and the exchange of prisoners. In reply I have to inform you that measures for those objects have for some time past and still are in progress, and nothing compatible with the dignity of the Government and the public interests shall be omitted for the purpose of accomplishing them.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

PADUCAH, February 8, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK.

GENERAL: Can General Tilghman and other officers be placed on parole and confined to the limits of Paducah? Answer Colonel Stuart, commanding at Paducah. I would suggest the privilege be given them.

U. S. GRANT,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, February 8, 1862.

Colonel STUART, Commanding at Paducah:

They can be released as proposed.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, Mo., February 8, 1862.

Surg. J. J. B. WRIGHT, Medical Director.

DOCTOR: It is absolutely necessary some officers of your department should attend to McDowell's College to arrange for the disposition of sick prisoners of war. Those who are too sick to be removed (the removal will take place to-morrow) will need to be removed to general hospital under the direction of a medical officer. I mention this for your information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SCHUYLER HAMILTON,

Brigadier General of Vols., U. S. Army, Commanding Saint Louis District.
