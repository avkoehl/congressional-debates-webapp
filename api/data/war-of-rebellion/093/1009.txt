Your dispatch received. I have just received a telegram from General Burbridge. His advance will be at Barboursville to-night. Scouts report main force of enemy at New Market, eight miles from Strawberry Plains, gathering in supplies.

The enemy is near Morristown. General Stoneman is here. I have a small mounted force at this place; no others, but am expecting some.

LEXINGTON, KY., November 23, 1864.

(Received 12.30 p.m .)

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Great complaints seem to have been made concerning the arrest of Lieutenant-Governor Jacob and ex-Colonel Frank Wolford by General Burbridge. I state the sentiment of the leading loyal men of Kentucky in saying that General Burbridge's action was advised, and is fully indorsed by them. These men are too dangerous to the safety of Kentucky to be permitted to remain here making incendiary and treasonable speeches. It is hoped General Burbridge's action may not be interfered with. I will write you by mail.

W. C. GOODLOE.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, November 23, 1864-2.20 p.m.

Major-General BURBRIDGE, Lexington:

Where is Governor Jacob now, and is he in custody?

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

LEXINGTON, November 23, 1864.

(Received 5.45 p.m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

Governor Jacob was sent to Catlettsburg, Ky., with orders to the commander of that place to send him up the valley of the Kanawha into the rebel lines. He was at Catlettsburg on the 14th instant, since which time no report of him has been received. General Burbridge is in command of his troops en route for Cumberland Gap.

Respectfully,

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
