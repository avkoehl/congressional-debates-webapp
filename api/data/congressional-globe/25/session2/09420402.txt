drawing to a close, and that, consequently, our
time tb precious but the recollection that I have
seldom, heretofore, obtruded myself upon the
Hou.e, or committee, and always with brevity, in
connection with the importance of the subject now
under examination, will, I trust, relieve me fion
the charge of asking, on this, occasion, an unrea-
onable indulgence. No question, perhaps, since
the American Revolution, and the subsequent
adoption of the Federal Constitution, has arisen in
the United States, involving more seriously and
extensively the principles of civil liberty and free
government
Ought the financial operations of the Federal
Government to be entirely and completely sepa-
rated frum the business and the transactions of
banking institutions? Ought that "Treasuiy,"
merit oned in the Constitution, required by it, in
wh'ch "all public money" is to be placed and
\opt, and from which "no money shall be drawn,
but in cons"quence of appropriations made by
law '—ought that "Treasury" to exist separately
and distinctly organized—Onght that "Treasury"
to be independent of the banks of the country? Or,
o"ght that "Treasury" to be closely connected and
allied with the banks, and made essentially de-
pendent on them'' Does the Constitution require that
this "Treasury" shall, in any manner, be connect-
ed with, or made dependent on banking compa-
nies'! Does ihe Constitution requue, did I ask—
does it peí mil ihat money in the "Treasury" may
oe promiscuously blended with the funds of these
drnoames, and used and employed in their busi-
ness, so that its ultimate avatlibility to the Go-
vernment is left to depend upon their honesty, their
solvenc r, their success or failure in trade' And if
the Constitution does not positively enjom such
con icction, st d is it practicable or possible to dis-
pense witn li? Is such a connection "necessary
and proper for carrjing into execution" any power
vested bv the Constitution in the Government of
the United States, or in any department or officer
thereof? Can the "Treasury" of the United States
be properly, completely, and constiMionaUy orga-
nized, and made to perform its appropriate func-
tion- successfully, without the aid or interposition
of bank agency?
Sir, these questions in\olve the gieat problem,
are the people capable ol solf government, whose
so ution, us had flattered ourselves, had been defi-
nitely accomplished by the establishment «foui Re-
publican and representative sjstems Substantial-
ly the momentous, the vital question, is revived of
th"* i ight and the capacity of the people to govern
themselves
I ask, Mr Chairman, if the framers of the Con-
stif> tion hid sufficient wisdom, and did they cxer-
cts* this wisdom, in forming a plan of Government
capable of healthy existence, and efficient action,
independent of the fact, whether companies, with
the power of banking, would, or would rot, be cre-
ated Can the people of the United States, through
their onn agents, constitutionally appointed, and
constUu'icnally icsponuble, administer this Federal
Gevernmcnt peacefully and successfully1 Or, must
they, with a shameful and degrading admission of
their incompetency, resign the management of a
portion of the affairs and business of their Govern-
ments—a portion, too, vitally important; must the
people of the several States confess their utter in-
capacity, and quietly submit the management of
their finonces, their entire moneyed concerns, u
artificial persons—to bodies politic, nre-ponaible to
the constituted au formes ef the United btatts, dis-
tinguished from the mass of the community, not by
their superior integrity, but by their odious mono-
polies and exclusive privileges, who boast of vest-
ed rights, not enjoyed by the rest of society, but in-
violably secuied by charters, which, in most in
stances, presumptuously claim to be beyond Ihe
reach of repeal or modification by the whoje legis-
lative authority of the country?
Mr Chairman, I desire to examine this proposed
union of Banks and Government according to its
own intrinsic merit I will not yield blind obedi-
ence to the opinions or dicta of any, however emi-
nent I will deliberate and reflect I will draw
my own éonclusions. I will form my own opi-
mpns-, and I will venture to express them, I hope,
with becoming boldness I will not search for
precedents, scatteied through the history of Federal
legislation, opposite and irreconcilable in charac-
ter, and borrowing their complexion from the al-
ternate ascendancy of party No, sir- were all
such precedents collected, and congregated into a
mountain'  magnitude, they would not, they ought
not, to preponderate over my own deliberate con-
victions of the true intent and purposa of the Fede-
ral Constitution It is my duty to exercise the fa-
culties of my own mind, however feeble, m apply-
ing the test of immutable principle, and the Con-
stitution, to every measure presented here for adop-
tion or rejection A tame submission to prece-
dents, an acknowledgment of their binding obliga-
tion, may protect error, and promote a continuance
of its evils in society, whereby the development of
truth is retarded, and the gradual work of ím-
proiement is impeded. On this doctrine of prece-
dents, I beg leave to read to the committee some
brief extracts from a political work, written by one
of Virginia's most illustrious statesmen. I refer to
the late John Taylor, of Caroline, than whom no
man had more thoroughly considered the principles
of the Constitution, and to whose writings Mr Jef-
ferson himself confessed that he was indebted for
the correction of some errors of opinion into which
he had fa'len
' Lnt us (says he m his Construction Construed ) look at the
logic which supposes that acquiescence makes pucedents, and
that precedents make reason All piectdents 01 laws aie at
fiist theory and acquiescence alone can convert them mto
piactice Bank ng began as a theory, and political augits
differed intheit prognostications ef its effects The worst pie
cedents are often but tittle felt m their infancy, because they
move with caution intil they gather strength, and thewoise
they art, the more time is eften lequired to develope then cha
racier Some foretold that banking would be beneficia), otheis
that it would be pernicious to our country Tt would be an odd
judgment, howevei honest, whichshould assert, that fulfilment
ought to desti oy, and falsehood to establish an augury, because
just -uthetime when experience has conveued the theory of
banking into evidence, both felt and undf rstood, acquiesence
has also mellowed the sanie theory into a precedent, and a
precedent deprives us of the benefit of experience, so that the
tune expended in ascertaining then nth oí falsehoidoi an au
gury, renders it impossible to remedy its imposition, just at the
momuit when it is discovered }
And in another place he continues
1 Pi eredents would make a gti mge species of Constitution
according to out no ions they woul 1 be repealal le by the í e
g ^latures which ma 'e ihem In t^Obe counmes wheie the Go

poitanct after have obtained the title of pie^pdents It will
th n become a ma ter of very great ¡mpurtanee to asceitam by
horn this title is to bo btMowed '
And whilst I repudiate the authority of precedents,
I will not search for practices or professious of
party to guide me I will not hunt up the isolated
opinu ns of this or that illustrious statesman, living
or dead, as a rule by which my own vote is to be
controlled Much less will I i el y on any hasty or
detached opinions of my own, expressed or infer-
red, on former occasions My freedom of thought
and my right of independent deliberation, shall not
be fettered with the chains of prejudgment The
illuminations of experimental truth shall not be ex-
cluded from mv political path, because heretofore I
may have boggled in darkness, or been misled by
an imperfect light or a false glare The friendly
advances of reason and argument, -with all their
benign influences, shall not be obstructed by any
barriers which pride and prejudice may exeit in
defence of primary positions. No peculiarity of
position, no associations, personal or political, con-
nected with its first occupancy, can justify, for the
single purpose of holding out in its defence, an
abandonment of the interests of the w hole country
Whilst pride may urge selfish considerations in
favor of obstinate perseverance, patriotism will
strongly recommend the surrender of original pre-
possessions for the sake of a nation's good. Those
who wi 1, may make their boasted consistency the
sole deity of the.r adoration, and may fall down at
its shrme m blind iiid unthinking devotion Those
who will, may remain immovably fixed to their
peculiar positions, and may spurn with scorn every
change or modification which time and circum-
stance, and the development of principles, may
suggest and invite, until their positiors, by their
outre and inharmonious appearance, as contrasted
with (he surrounding improvements, effec eil by a
judicious application of political seience to human
affairs, will serve only to excite the ridicule of all
intelligent and patriotic observers. For myself, I
shall ever hold my anxiety for consistency m strict
subordination to my love of tiuth The correctness
and sincerity of my present convictions, are to me
a matter of much higher consideration than their
conformity to opinions of a previous period on
other subjects, and in a far different condition of
affairs. Instead of appealing to formal precedents,
to the influence of conspicuous names, or mooting
the unimportant question of my own consistency, I
prefer to recur to fundamental principles, and to
the plain letter and spirit of the Constitution, and
by these to test the correctness of my present
views.
It is then, sir, a fundamental principle, that there
is a division of political power between the States
and the Federal Government. The powers con-
ferred on the Government of the Untied States, in
the language of the Federalist, "are few and de-
fined," whilst, without exception, " the powers
not delegated to the United States by the Constitu-
tion, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively, or to the people " The
powers, therefore, which remain with the States
respectively, and with the people of each State,
"are many and undefined." These Governments
having a separate and distinct organization, and
having a separate and independent action of each
other, in the execution of their respective powers
and duties, there is necessarily a dititdMig-Zjne, whieh
must be kept constantly in view. The more clear-
ly it is marked and defined, the more certainly will
each Government-be restricted within its own ap-
propriate and constitutional province, and the more
effectually will confusion, embarrassment, and col-
lision be avoided m the progress of their adminis-
trations. An obliteration of this line, ah encroach-
ment upon this boundary, mars the beauty, de-
ranges the design, destroys the harmony, and im-
pairs the strength of our whole political system.
Having presented to the committee tins funda-
mental and essential principle of a separation of
the powers of the States and of the Government
of the United States, I beg leave to read certain
expuss provisions of the Constitution, to which our
action, to be rightful, must conform in prescribing
regulations for the administration of the finances.
Section eight of article the fl st, vests Congress
with power—
" lo lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts, and excises, to pay
the debts and provide for the common defence and general wel
faro of the United States, hut alt daties, impose, and excises,
sh ill be unifoim throughout t^e United Stan s,
"To boi row money on the credit of the united States,
"To coin money regulate the value theteof and of foreign
com and fix thestandaid of weights and measures,
" 11 piovide for ihe punishment of counterfeiting the secu
ntie« and current coin of the Lnited States,
" To make all laws which shall be necessary and pioper for
carrying into exection the foregoing powers, and all o her pow
ers vested by this Constitution in the Government of the United
States, or m an) depaitment or officer thereof '
Sec 7, Anr "1 'All bills for raising revenue shall originate
in the House of Repiesentative  "
Sec 9 "No money shall be drawn from the Treasury but in
consequence of appropriations made bv law and a regulai
statement and account of the receipts and expenditures of all
public money shall be published from time to time "
Sec 10 ' No State shall com money, emit bills of credit,
make any thing but gold and silver com a tender in payment of
debts"
Now, Mr Chairman, it is proposed, on one
hand, to'orgamze the Treasury of the United States,
so as to d spense with bank agency, and to con-
form strictly with the requisitions of the Constitu-
tion, on the other hand, it is proposed to engage
and employ, by contract, State banks, corporations,
to perform the oflice of fiscal agents to the Federaj
Government. Thus a direct issue is, made up
between the advocates and opponents of (he two
schemes, and fairly presented to the country. To
the employment of the State banks, an objection,
m Zitnitte,has sometimes been urged—that they axe
contrary to the Constitution of the United States.
It is not necessary to the course of argument which
I propose, to enter m'o the question of the constitu-
tional power of the States to inooporate banking
companies. From careful study and honest con-
\ iction, I belong to that political party who insist
upon a strict and limited construction of the grants
of power enumerated in -the Constitution, and
who, in my own State, m the early struggle waged
between State rights and Federal encroachment,
concurred with the General Assembly in. peremp
tonly and explicitly declaring that "u ,w#feM
