I propose to rendezvous my command at Austin and push toward Clinton until I can hear where Fagan or Shelby is, when I will take them by detail or united, as the case may be.

Major W. H. MORGAN, Assistant Adjutant-General:

I inclose a letter from Captain Ferree, commanding Island 63. I have sent the Lexington down. The bearer, captain of steamer John Raine, reports all quiet and the Lexington at anchor. The Elwood is safe, and will be until you can send relief. I have a letter from Major-General Dana; all right. My scout is not in from Colonel Winslow's command.

ISLAND 63, MISSISSIPPI RIVER,

September 6, 1864.

Colonel CROOKS, Commanding District of Eastern Arkansas:

COLONEL; I had scarcely arrived at this place this evening when I learned from good authority that Forrest and Chalmers, with their forces, were crossing Sunflower River, sixteen miles east of this place.

The plan is to take the island, and then General Smith's fleet as it comes up the river. Can you send me a gun-boat immediately? I will defend the island until the last extremity.

I remain, colonel, your very obedient servant,

S. G. FERREE,

Captain, Commanding Island 63, Mississippi River.
