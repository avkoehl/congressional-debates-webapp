HEADQUARTERS, Richmond, Va., April 23, 1862.

Brigadier General S. G. FRENCH,

Commanding, &amp;c., Wilmington, N. C.:

GENERAL: In reply to your telegram of yesterday,* I am directed by General Lee to say that all available arms have been given to General Holmes for distribution to the troops under his command. There are none now on hand for issue save pikes. He thinks you might arm the regiment at Wilmington by placing pikes in the hands of the men at the heavy batteries, and giving their muskets, as far as they will go, center companies with pikes, the flanking companies having the rifles. This is the best arrangement that can now be made.

I am, very respectfully your obedient servant,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
