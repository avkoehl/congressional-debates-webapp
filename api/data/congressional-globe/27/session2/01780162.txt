ever, that the gentleman from  Massachusetts had a right to  1
raise the question of privilege, andrefer to the petition so far
as was necessary to elucidate the question
Mr WtsE asked if the quest on of privilege was not made
yesterday, and if that question was not contained in "the whole"
sü ject," that-was laid on the table
Mr ADAMS I claim it aa a matter of right and privilege to
be heard in reply to the charges contained in that petit on
The Speaker decided yesterday that it was my right, and if the
fentleman chooses he can appeal from the decision oí  the
'hair
The SPEAKER, in reply to Mr Wise said that the question
of reception, and the motion of the gentleman from Kentucky,
[Mr Marshall,! meielyweie laid on the table by the vote of
yesterday The Chair did not thmk that the question of p ivi
lege was ever pending and consequently it was not laid on the ;
table The question of pimlege was one that the gentleman
could raise at any time
Mr WISE Did I understand the Chair as saying that the
question of privilege was not laid on the table, and ihat the
t^emleman can raise it now? If so, I must insist that the gen
tjeman confine himself strictly to it
Mr HOLMES asked if it had ever been known in that as
sembly before, or m any other aa&embly, that when a gentle
man, whe her under erroneoua impressions or otnerwu,e, ap
pealed to the courtesy of hu= fellow member5 to be heard m
reply to adegations affecting his. chaiactei or his conduct,
that courtesy had been defied him Whatever was the charac
tei of that memorial, whether it was a hoax, as some gentle
men supposed, or a genuine paper, as the gentleman from Mas
sachu&etts believed it to be, whatever might be the impressions
of honorable members with regard to it, he was unwilling to
deny the gentleman who was assailed in it the privilege of a
reply
Some remaiks were here made by the SPEAKER not heard
by the Reporter
Mr HOLMES The question is whether the gentleman shall
be permitted to address the House m reply to the charges con
tamed m the petition If there be a doubt, it should be con-
strued In favor of courtesy
The fePEAKER said that the gentleman from Massachusetts
had a right to be heard on the question of privilege
Mr ADAMS [much excited, and raising his voice ] Yes,
sir, piovided there is no point of order raised—no fifty or one
hundred questions of order raised to gag me, as the gentleman
from Maryland and Virginia [Messrs Johnson and Wise,]
have been doing
Mr WM COST JOHI\SON again addressed the Chair on
the point of order raided by him, and m the course of his re
marks observed that the question of privilege had been with
drawn by the gentleman from Massachusetts, when the gen
tientan from Kentucky [Mr Marshall] moved that he be per
mitted (o address the House m nis defence
Mr AD WIS interrupted Mr J and (raising his voice with
much exct'ement) said  ir, the gentleman from Maryland
speaks false, I said no such thing, I waived the question of
privilege, I did not withdraw it
Mr JOHNSON I will appeal to the recollections of the
gentlemen present to bear me out m what I say [Here wa¿
a perfect uproar 3
Several voices  "He did withdraw it "
The SPEAKER called Mr Adams to order, and directed
him to take his seat
Mr WARREN of Georgia moved a reconsideration of the
vote on laying the whole subject on the table
Mr W CO  r JOHNSON said, that before he took his seat
he would withdiaw his point of order, alter the motion of the
gentleman from Georgia, [Mr Wakrun,] which he regretttd,
and would say but a word oi two in leply to theiude re-
mark of the member from Massachusetts 1 hat all t! e mem
heraaiound himagieed in the aeouricy ofhiJ(Mr 1 b)stae
ment, and he appealed to the recotlecuonof all the memlvis
who were present, if then lecoliection did not accoid with his
<Mi Is) And he (Mi I ) would say that, if othei gentlemen
felt privileged t« be rude and coarse in pastion and wanton
ne¡>s, that no departu e by othei s, no ebullition oi feeling, no
s ene of excitement, no violent and course assault from that
gentleman, would ever betiay him for a moment to depart
from the rules of Parliamentary propuety and the conduct of
a gentleman
Mr ADAMS Sir, the gent'eman has had an example of
that    He has heard it before
The question on reconsideration asmoiedbyMr Wapren,
yras here taken, and carried w about a division
Mr WISE asked the Chair to state tie question as it then
stood
The SPE AKER said that the question recurred on the mo
non of the gentleman from Tennessee to lay tne whole subject
on the table In his judgment, the question of pnvilege was not
i i volved in this motion, and that that question wa& not pending
before the House when the motion was made, in a manner that
made it a question to be laid on the table
Mr AAROA V BROWN called for the yeas and nays, */hich
were oideied
Mi WiSF wished to know ti the question of privilege was
then bef>re the Housed
Ihe&PLAKEK. nd not think that it wis
Mi aVUTHof Vngima Have we gained any thins?, then,
by the decision of the last question takenl
The fePEAKCR    That is for the House to decide
The question was then taken on laying the whole subject on
th-1 table, and Io«st
1 he question then came upon Mi Marshall's motion to
albw the gentleman 'rom Massachusetts [Mi Adams] to a 1
dress the House in reply to the charges contained m the peti
tinn
I he leading jf the petition was called for
Mr WISE would dsk,„before the peti'ion was read, if it was
m possession of trie Hou^
TheoPUAKER It is not in the possession of the House but
it is a paper m the pos^eíbion oí the gentleman from Ma sachu
sett , which he haj a right to hive read at the Cleik e table
Mr WISE called for the reading of Mi Mat1 s>hall s motion
anl it was accordingly read by the Chrk, fiom his minutes
llhemoaonwas m ¡substance, that Mi Adam  be permitted
to   > Hre=s this House in rep y to "the petm m in his poshes
810(1 ' ]
Mc WISE I would inquire what petition that motion refeis
^0,111 «peakfng of "the petition ' and I wish to know if that
motion puts tne petition upon the Journal of the House The
motion is, that the gentleman fiom Massachusetts he heard in
reply to the petition in his possession Now I ask whether it
will not require a majority of two thirds to carry that motion?
I make the noint, that, inasmuch as the motion makes the udu
sual request that the House will hear a member in reply to a
paper that is not in its possession that it is within no rule, and
therefore requires a majority of two thirds to pass it
Mr EVERETl moved the previous question, whwh was se
condedhy the House
The question "shall the mam question be now put*" wasde
cided in the affirmative
The main question (being on the motion of Mr Marshall)
was then taken by yeas and nays, at the call oí Mr Wise, and
decided in the affirmative, as follows*

Mi J CAMPBELL rese to a privileged question Hero=e, he
said, lot the puipose of moving the reconsideration of the vote
just taken, and he begged leave to make the remaik that he
had vo ed with the majority, because he was not allowed an
opportunity of explaining himself and that he might, by
making the motion, he now di I obtain that privilege
Messrs  LVERE1T and MORGAN rose to oruer, and the
former asked if the question was debatable
The SPEAKER said it was
Mi ADAMS said that if ltwas debatable on one side it cer
tamly was on the othei
Mi GARRET DAVIS rose also to a prmledged question
The gintleman from South Carolina, he said, had no right
to take the floor from the gentleman from Ma^aachuse t=s
Ihe'iPDAKFR said that the gentleman from south Caioh
na was in order, and was the first to obtain the floor after the
vote had been announced
Mr CaMPBELI was about commencing'With his reraaiks
when
Mi BRIGG3 called him tooidei, on thegmund that hi° col
league [Mr Adam^I was entitled to the floor
Mr WISE Did not tne Specker decide that the gentleman
from South Car dina had the floor'' [The Speaker replied
m the affirmative 1 Then I call the gentleman from Mib&achu
setts to oider
Mi MARSHAI L heie stated m teply toa remark of some
gentleman not seen oi heard by the Reporter, tint his motion
was to allow the gentleman fiom Massachusetts [Mr Ad wis]
to be heard in defence of the charges made against him in the
petition not as a matter oí privilege but as an act of < ourtesy
on the pan of the Home
Mr WISE To defend himself from charges contained
in a paper that is not m the posse* ion of the House
Mr CAMPBELL of south Carolina commenced again with
his explanation, but was interrupted again with deafening cries
tn nuler and aftei order was somewhat restored, said that the
motion of the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr Marshall] was
that the genUeman from Massachusetts [Mr Adams] should be
heard in hisowndefenceagam°t thechirgescontainedm thepe
tition which he himself had presented to the House, and which he
believed to be genuine That there was no quest on of pnvi
lege involved, Mr C thought could be easily demonstrated,
foi whatever charge had been brought against the gentleman,
had oeen brought by h.m^elf m piesenüng the petition, and he
was therefore ins own accusei and con! 1 at any time with
draw the accusation Again there was no question of pnvi
lege foi another reason, and that wa^ if the charge that the
gentleman hboied under a monomania could bt pi o\ed, if af
(or led no gionndd for accusation against him inasmuch as it
mí not an ofenoe of which the Hou>e could take cognizance
But tne gent km an from Massachusetts having made it aques
tion of pr vil ge, and the gentleman from Ken'ucky fMr Mar
shal-0 having moved that he should be heard in his defence,
tl e matter assumed a different aspect, in I for one he would
say that hewoud, with great pleasure, allow the ventrable
gentleman O explain him^tdf but for one reason This charge
was based in the course which the gentleman and hi1? fuends
thought H to be their duty to pur ue on a que^t-on of grea deli
cacy—a course which he and other gentlemen weie orrc-ed
to as in the r minion detrimental to the LD3t ínteres a of the
countrv and the narmony of the Imion, and in defending him
.self hewiuld most probab y, descant on top cs of an exciting
*and iiritaungthaidUei He would tin refor with great defet
ence, ask of the \ener> ble gentleman if itwould bepibtoi ge
nerous for him tobe allowed to di^cuM matte s injurious to the
feelings of other gentlemen who could not have the privilege ol
aieply He had no objection to the discussion of this subject
of petition He believed it had nof been sufficiently ducussed,
that the view taken ol it by the gentleman from Massachusetts
and his friends was of Uil most superficial character, and that
the course pursued by him (Mr C ) was not only dictated by
the first law of nature, that of self preservation, but that it vio-
lated no constitutional right of any citizen of the United States
If this question* was thrown wide open to discussion, this House
would not adjourn till the dog days If the gentleman was al-
lowed to defend himself, he must condemn tho^e who pursued a
different course, and, therefore, it was the duty of all theee gen-
tlemen—a duty of self rebpect, a duty which they owed to
themselves, unless they had full assurance that they should
have an opportunity to reply—to vote aga nst allowing the gen-
tleman to proceed
Mr ADAMS said that the gentleman from South Carolina, in
making this motion of reconsideiation, by which he admitted
tnathehad voted against his conscience, had thought proper
not only to enter into the merits ol the question, but, unrebuked
by the bpeakei, had thrown open the whole subject of his con-
duct, and that of manv of his tuencK, m íeference to the treat-
ment of petitions    He thanked the gentleman foi it
Mi CAMPBLLL begge ! leave to correct the gentleman He
had confined himself to the pomtinvoived m his motion for re-
cxnsideiatio"—diat the gentleman irom Massachusetts could
not be heaid in hig own ce^ence without attacking others, who
ought a so to be heaid
Mi >I)A la 1 he gentleman fiom ^outh Carolina said that
he hud conlit td himself to one print Now did ne confine him-
self to hi point when he eckrowled«ed that he and his friends
had ¡iot do>~e light with legaid to the reception of petitions
Thegbntk nat had not done jusuce to tí e people of the United
Statc.& in tiamp ug upon their lights involved in the great right
ofpum n
>ír WisE demanded tha the gent eman be confined to the
quest on
Mi A DIM*- Why did not the Speaker confine the gentle-
tleman from Somh Caiolma to the question 1 I thank the gen-
tleman from ¡so Uh ( arohnafoi ihrowmg open the subject, and
I thank the Speaker foi not rebuking Mm for it I and my
friends than^ wod, have now ihe \\ ho e subject open, and we
will avail ou selves ol it
Mr WiSL'o^e to a point of order He asked if it was right
for the geitleman to discuss the right of petition on the leave
granted bv the House for him to proceed
The SPFAKER said it was not, and the gentleman from
Massachusetts must confine himaelt to the question
Mr CAMPBhXL I rise to another point oí order [Laughter]
Mr Al)A"ViS made some remarks not distinctly understood,
and
The SPEAKER referred him to a decision which the House
overruled, in which this pi ease point was involved, the gen-
tleman from Massachusetts himself voting to ieverse the deci-
sion of the Cnair
Mi ABAMS Did that justify the Speaker in not confining
the gentleman from South Carolina (o the question, and in,
confining me to it in applying the rule to me, and not apply-
ing it to another1*
The SPEAKER The gentleman from feouth Carolina
[Mr Campbell] spoke in geneial terms, had said that he and
his friends bad taken one course, and the gentleman from Mas
sach isottsand his friends had taken another, without saying
what that course was ! he gentleman spoke in general terms,
and n the gentleman from Massachuseits would do the same
thing, the Chair would not interrupt him
Mi ADAMS The gentleman Irom ^outh Carolina gave as
one of h s points, that 1 could not reply to the charges contained
in this petuion, because 1 presented it myself— because I was
my own Tccuser Does it deprive me of the right of self de-
fence, because lam he first to make known to the House the
charges that have been made against mel Sir, there was a case
which the gentleman irom Virginia himself ought to recollect,
asd which was lounded on a newspaper paragraph It is a
ommon occuuer ce foi gentlemen to bung to the notice of the
Hoiibe a paiagraph in a r ewspaper, and say that it is a breach
of pn\ ilege It is utterlv at variance with the known practice
of the House, to say that because I bring the memorial to its
noüue, 1 cannot answer it But I have another reason for
wishing to reply to the chaiges contained in this petition which
I have not yet made known to the House It is this In the
letter transmuting this memorial to me, the leasons are given
why it is sent to me, m& ead of one of the gentlemen belonging
to the Geirgia delegation m ( ongres I will read the letter
it is \ ery respectful and courteous m its language
[Mr A here uaJ the letter which wa¡>dated at Clarksville,
Georgia, 10th December, 1841, and commented on it as he pro
cee led X he writei giving as the reason why the petition was
tiansmitted to Mr Adam** instead of one of the Georgia delega-
tion, that the petitioners weieamwilling to be the cause of any
unkindness between Mr A and the gentleman who might pre-
sent it ]
It was a deliberate thing, said Mr A and was s gned by the
Secietary of the meeting
Mi WARRLN    Read the name of ti e secietary
Mr ADAMS It is James Play fair, and his name cone-
sponds entirely with his chaiacter There was fair f lay m the
c mrse he t ad pursue 1, and he honored 1 im foi it
Mr IlABFRfellAM     1 here is no such pei«on in the county
Mr ADAMS Tie gtmleman from Georgia [Mi Haber
sha.m] said yesteuby thattheie wet o no such persons m tho
c un y as the signéis of tht pe mon
Mi IIABCR&HAM I «¡aid that I kneio of no such persons in
mj coun y, and certainly theie is no such pet «on m it as James
PUyfan
Mi ''ADAMS The gentleman fiom South Caiolma [Mr
Holmes] «ai 1 he di 1 not be ieve the petition to be a hoax and
thai I ought tobe heaid in ler ly to it
Mr HOI ML  «it] nl to explain what he did say ltwas
tha , hoax oi no hoax courtesy leqmrtdthat the gentleman
should he heard
Mr ADAM'-' Weil ir I thank the gentleman from South
Carolina i peiceive that he belongs to the ' Playfuir"
family    [I au^htei ]
Mr ADAMS then went on wi hhi<* comments on the letter
tiansmitnng the petition to him The^e gentlemen, while they
thought him utterly incompetent for ihe station he held as
chan man of xh° C( mmiftee oi I oreign Relations pieseived to
him all pionur de icacy ar d decorum, so much so as to fear
that the sending their i etition to ore of then ow r Representa
tives might etc ite unkind lteupgson his part towards him, and
thereiore they sent then pe m n to him (Mr A) He would
