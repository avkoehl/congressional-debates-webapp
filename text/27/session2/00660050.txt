CONGRESSIONAL, GLOBE.
South must not be left to perish She constitutes a glorious
part of this great Confederacy Her lands must not be left uo
run to waste, hei slaves must not be left m idleness, her gentle
men must not be broken down and ruined No you shall
buy at home—you musí get your cotton, from Charles on, and
"Savannah, and Mibile You shall not breakore half this Union,
to throw all the profits oi your business into the hands of a fo
reign nation " That was what he would say to New Eng
land m such a case And if Southern gent'emen would con
aider it sound xeasomng then, why was it not equally sound
now?
Now then cry was,' Let us alone—let ua buy wheie we can
buy cheapest—you force us t  buy from a home market,
when we prefer a market abioad—jou violate free trade—
you tax us fot the benefit of Yankee minufacture^ " I hat
was now the argument—that was now the Southern doctime
and the Southern policy And Mr M said h*2 thought he had
gone a good way to say that, admitting their pobiuun to be cor
rect, ho was willing to ' go the wiole hog," and compel rsew
England to protect tneir cotton But such was not the true
docfnne of protection The lankees, owing to their pecuhur
national character and condition, were as well calculated to be
comea, manufacturing people asa/iy in the world and they
could lnrn^toh to the South whatavei the South needed on better
teims than any body else, and protection extended to them was
merely protecting private and domestir capital against the hos
tile policy of foreign Governments Manufactures! if they
were to ñoun«h, must at first be nourished, guarded, courted,
fondled dining theu chil hood Mr M would heie assert that
there never had been a nation oneaith which had ¡succeeded in
establishing manufactmes among its people without making
their protection the business of thur legislation, and apart ol
their national policy
En° land had, at this day, the finest marine perhaps in the
world An 1 look athei celebrated 'Navigation Act,J a law
* In which, with the most jealous anxiety, she fostered the ante
rest of her own naval aichirecture against thit of all other
nations So oovious, so pal-able was the benefit to her of
su^h i policy, that even Adam toinith himself, the great advo
cateof freetradeand lis kindred doctrine'?, eien he was com
pelled to admit that the policy of that act was sound, and went
to make Britain the first maritime natmn of the wo  Id Yet
her cairymg trade mi Tht have been coaductel on cheaper
terms m I>utch bottoms, cutshe was wisely content to pay that
small additional difference for the sake 01 insuung permanent

of the world ihis was the course of Great Britain
feo &he had ever done and what haj been the result? Had
theie not been other great commercial cities m Europe besides
Londonl and had there not been $reat manufacturing establish
ments m Euiope before Eng and owned any? Yet, by steadily
persevering in one lin of wist, protective policy those haughty

Mr M sud he was no enemy to Southern labor when advo

phed, ai, not to feel the los&—thia, this would be, to me, the veiy
realization of Amencar independence and prospenly But this
country is not and never can be truly independen ,so long as
our own labor and our own capital are left unprotected Neve*
so lorg as it is the darling objectof our own Government to
crush the industry and dash down all the enterprise of those
it should protect and foster

sinner If to feel the gTow of one common nation m my bosom
—if to bold that the man who resides at the extreme Noith is
as much my Mother as the cotton planter of Georgia—if this 13
hostility totle&outh then I am her enemy
But, as to Southern rights, let no man lay his bands upon
them My observation m I.fehas taught me tobelieve thatm
all domestic quariels theie aie usually fauHs on both sides
And I will say to my Northen friends, Why be eternally sink
mg at that soie which, God knows, is sore enough without
blows from you^ Why keep up this eternal turmoil and excite

When Amencars spoke of dissolving the Union, they spoke
of what they Bhould not—the idea was unnameable The
Greek legislator gave it as a reason for providing no pum&h
ment for parricide, that such a crime ought never to be men
tioned but if Northern gentlemen chose to use their strength
for buch an end as Abolition, this Union mubt crumble, come
whaf might Jo attempt «ueh a thing was to violate the on
gmal compact of all the States Ihe slave States were slave
¡states befoie this Union exited they were slave States when
the Cavahersof the South first joined the Northern Presbyte
nans to drive back the assaults of oppression When Greene
and Manon fought sideby side in the ranks of armed freemen
for the protection of then rights, the Southern States were
s'aveholdingMates, and their rights as slaveholders were among
those for the pi otection of which the sword of the Revolution
was diawn They held a constitutional recognition and a con
stitu'ional guarantee of their rights as slaveholders, m the pro
vision which required their sister States to delive  up runa
ways, when found, to then ughtful master* and to aid their
Southern brethren m case of a ¡servile insutiection The di earns
of modern philanthropists about all men of all co'ois bein¿
posseted of equal political rights had not been the doctrine of
those days, and African slaves weie not then íecognised nt
treated as Ameucan citizei s The national guaiantee then
thrown over the slaveholding States guarded them as w 11
against tneir sistei States as against th^ rower of the General
Gov mment The State of Ohio must deliver up the fugitive,
despite ot all her Sute sovereignty and ail hei Abolitonno
tions Southern institutions were solemnly reco^ms^d by the
organic law of ne Gi nfederacy, and vet gentlemen now came
fo warl and insisted that, because fl ey were the stiopgtr
partv they might do what wxs exn esy fmbnlrl n bv the on
gmal compact that held us ad together' Ifiheysnould attempt
tms it would be an act of lawless, violence—an act which could
not, whic1! ojnht not, and which would not, be borre
On this subject of slavery, Mr M said he might pmsne
what policy he pleased h t, State was soveie gn and could act

Mr M m conclusion, observed that he had come to the House
prostrated by a nervous headach, and he ought not, under such
ciicuinstances, to rise on that floor without fear and tiembling
This wasan evil which had been shaied by other men, butthere
was no one. he believed, who had been so harshly treated by the
letter writers of Washington The\ hunted him to taverns,
they letailed his private conventions If he spoke a word in
a public bar mom, they took it down (All in shorthand, he
supposed ) [A laugh ] Now, in Kentuck), no matter how hot
might be the political d.sputes prevailing, that son of thing was
dro cnbed not so heie He was himt-eK too old and toe tough
tobe much annoyed by this comse of things, but there were
othei«, out of the Capitol, who felt some inteiest in his course,
andwho^e eyes were constantly turned this way lornewaof

him his heaitfeltthanks
Mr RHETT having obtained the floor, offered the following
as an amendment to the amendment of the gentleman from
New Hampshne, [Mr Atherton 1
"With instructions that, should it be in their opinion expedí,
ent to lay additional duties they shall be so laid as not to dis
criminate m favor of any particular claes of industry in the
United states"
And the quebtion now being on the amendment to the amend-
Mr Rhbtt said the observation had been made that he had
stated he did not undeistand how a tariff for revenue could be
laid compatibly'with a tanF for protection He had said this
m distinct bearing on the proportion before them and that if
a duty foi protection was incompatible wtth a strict tariff for
revenue, and if the object ut the Hou«e was to lay a. duty for
revenue it would appeal that the message should "0 to the
Com ni'tee of Wa>s and Means, but if on the contrary, the
two were tompatioie, it might, withou any great violation  of

thrown out tms ore reason wh oh he thought should govern

had discu«eed it in the usual way wuh iho e who were unable
to meet an argument the, hac1 resorted to simp!" denuncia-

ic wasiidiculoa-, aid ome other me  bcr th n it w<ts ab urd,
yet nope of them had met the propo* u on and endeavored to
si ow, either by fads or íeasoning that it was untenable
He (Mr R ) believed it to be strictly true There were
those who contends 1 that Government has the power in it
self of laying a j. roteen e duty on tne giound of providing
' foi the general welfaic,' and others who cl imed this as an
incident to the po«ei of protecting < omrntrce, but the ground
thatnau been taken m justification of piotec'ive duties by all
who h«a precede 1 him, except two gentlemen, was that the
powei of laying da íes foi piotection was incidentally included
m laving duties foi revenue The gentlemen horn 'New York
