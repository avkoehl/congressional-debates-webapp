HEADQUARTERS MOUNTAIN DEPARTMENT, April 13, 1862.

Brigadier General R. C. SCHENCK, Cumberland:

General Milroy's pickets were attacked yesterday by a force of about 1,000 infantry, two companies of cavalry, and two pieces of artillery. The skirmishing was brisk for some time, but the rebels were finally repulsed with considerable loss.

If General Banks has not yet advanced so that you are not yet prepared to move your infantry, send forward your entire force of cavalry to make a demonstration toward Franklin.

J. C. FREMONT.
HEADQUARTERS MOUNTAIN DEPARTMENT, April 13, 1862.

Brigadier General R. C. SCHENCK, Cumberland:

Every effort has been used to get from the Department the necessary transportation. It is reported to have been ordered, and upon its arrival no time will be lost in forwarding it to you.

Blenker's division is moving toward Moorefield. Advance to that place as rapidly as possible.

J. C. FREMONT.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 13, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Yours giving Blenker's position received. Am studying distances, roads, supplies, &amp;c., with a view to move via Thornton's Gap to Harrisonburg. Await answer from McDowell, Blenker, and Banks to propose something promising, as far as seen.

W. S. ROSECRANS,Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.

WINCHESTER, VA., April 13, 1862.

E. M. STANTON:

Difficulty in getting forage increases as troops advance. It will take system. Recommend that quartermasters be instructed to gather from the country systematically, without distressing. Fix moderate prices, and pay in United States bills. Confederates give scrip, not certificates. Bills will give satisfaction, and create an interest in our success. Prompt pay will cut off all complaints.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army.
