Have you good communication with General Sedgwick, and are you certain that he has received your dispatch with respect to the operations of his corps? Please answer immediately.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 4, 1863 - 6.20 a. m.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

I am anxious to hear from General Hooker. There is a strong force in front of me, strongly posted. I cannot attack with any hope of dislodging them until I know something definite as to the position of their main body and ours. I have sent two or three messengers to Banks' Ford, but none have returned, nor have I heard from the general since yesterday.

Send a regiment of cavalry to Sedgwick, to join him by Banks' Ford, if practicable, as it was yesterday.

Brigadier-General and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 4, 1863 - 6 a. m. (Sent 7 a. m.)

General HOOKER:

By an aide just from Sedgwick, I learn that Warren had fully explained to you his position. Warren's dispatch to Sedgwick had not reached him at 4 o'clock this morning. I fear it may have been captured. I learn it left Banks' Ford by an orderly for General Sedgwick, who had not returned. Copy was furnished for my information. I have sent it post-haste to General Sedgwick. It is important that you and he should know if the dispatch was captured.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
