This place is considered the most important of any place on the sounds of North Carolina, and a moderately respectable force should remain here to protect it. The force now here can hardly be called sufficient, and I certainly could not advise any further depletion here. Until the rebel ram at Plymouth is put hors de service all the troops that we might place on steamers for the relief of that place will be, in my opinion, useless.

Present for duty.

HDQRS. ARMY AND DISTRICT OF NORTH CAROLINA,New Berne, N. C., April 20, 1864.

Colonel RIPLEY,

Commanding Sub-district, &amp;c., Morehead:

We are threatened by the enemy and my forces are inadequate to guard the State of North Carolina. Plymouth is besieged and General Wessells needs help. Under such circumstances it is my duty to take any that comes to hand, until the crisis is passed. My order is his protection against all parties for any delay. In all probability one, two, or three days' detention will suffice. I had supposed that Colonel Scroggs would gladly come to the rescue of the cause of the country. If he declines you will place him in arrest and send he next officer in rank with the command to New Berne for temporary duty.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.
