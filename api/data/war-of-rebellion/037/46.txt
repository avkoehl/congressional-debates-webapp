119 MISSING; total, 1,202. When it is considered that this loss, being more than 28,7 per cent., took place in less than four hours, it is believed that few parallels can be found in the history of the present war. The greatest loss per cent. Took place in the Twenty-fourth Indiana, being over 40 per cent.,201 being their casualties out of less than 500 engaged in the action.

My DIVISION captured in the field over 300 prisoners, under fire, and 400 after the conflict ceased, making a total of 700; besides this, general McGinnis paroled sick and buried 221 rebel dead. Colonel Slack also paroled 189 wounded rebels and nurses, making a GRAND total as follows:

Eleven guns were captured before we received support from Quinby's DIVISION, and two of them brought off the field. The SECOND capture of the remaining five guns was the joint labor of my DIVISION and the re-enforcements sent to me from General Quinby's DIVISION. Colones Macauley has the battle flag of Fowler's battery.

By the aid of Dr. Robert B. Jessup, medical director of my DIVISION, and the untiring labor of Captain George W. Jackson, with his famous pioneers, comfortable bowers were made, and the wounded well provided with every necessary and luxury that could be found within their reach.

The medical corps of my DIVISION have again distinguished, themselves, and deserve special mention. Dr. J. W. H. Vest, twenty-eighth Iowa, rendered most efficient service in rallying the men in his command at a critical moment.

Chaplain Simmons, Twenty-eighth Iowa, and Chaplain Robb, forty-sixth Indiana, were found where good men should be-among the wounded and dying, rendering all the consolation and aid in their power.

On the 17th, my SECOND Brigade marched to Edwards Station, the First, under General McGinnis, remaining to care for the dead, wounded, and prisoners.

On the 19th, the First Brigade arrived at Edwards Station, and, with the DIVISION, marched to Black River Bridge.

On the 20th, the First Brigade marched to the Vicksburg fortifications, the SECOND Brigade remaining at Black River to guard the bridge.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

ALVIN P. HOVEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant Colonel WALTER B. SCATES,

Asst. Adjt. General on Major-General McClernand's Staff.
