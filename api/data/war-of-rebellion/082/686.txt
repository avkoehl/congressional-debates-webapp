HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, Friend's, July 30, 1864-2.50 p. m.

General MEADE:

After receipt of your orders to draw out my corps from the trenches in General Burnside's front, General Turner reported that he would by drawing out leave lunette where his men were with but one brigade to man it, in his opinion not-enough, and as General Burnside's men had suffered in the assault I concluded to leave two-thirds of Turner's division and all of Carr's there until night, when General Burnside could relieve them. Ames' brigade has gone to camp where Second Division was. Can I camp here to-night?

E. O. C. ORD,Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-7.30 p. m.

General ORD:

Can you not get your wounded off after dark to-night? The last time we had wounded left on the field Beauregard, on my application, refused to have a flag of truce to take off the wounded. It would, therefore, be useless to try it again.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH CORPS, July 30, 1864.

General MEADE:

The enemy have a terrible cross-fire at short range on the ground. It would be impossible. They have many wounded and dead there, and our trenches rake the place so that an offer might be mutually acceptable.

E. O. C. ORD,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 30, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General ORD:

Can you not give me an estimate through your medical director of the number of wounded; also the killed to-day in your corps? I want to make a consolidated estimate for General Grant.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
