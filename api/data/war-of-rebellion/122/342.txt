Colonel Briggs, arranged for Thursday. Thirteenth and two others, if possible, shall leave next week.

JNO. A. ANDREW,

Governor.

NEW YORK, July 22, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

Let the Government call instantly upon each State to double its quota of troops. No hesitation, but looking our disaster and danger full in the face, organize at once for success. In no other way can you preserve the unity of the North.

EDWARD P. COWLES.

NEW YORK, July 22, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

General Scott sent me order last night to hurry all the regiments to Washington. Three will go immediately. The first leaves to-day. I hope to-day to be informed that orders have been issued to purchase here at least the indispensable articles of equipment for them. Up to this hour we have received neither pay, clothing, nor anything but subsistence from the Government, and unless something be done for them I anticipate serious difficulty in getting some of them off.

DANIEL E. SICKLES.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

July 22, 1861.

Honorable D. E. SICKLES,

Colonel First Regiment, New York:

Quartermaster-General has given orders to quartermaster at New York to provide for your men such equipment as pertains to his department.

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.

HARRISBURG, July 22, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

From the two regiments now here of the three-months' men, about being mustered out of service, I am of opinion I can form a new regiment and send it on immediately. Shall I do it if I can?

A. G. CURTIN,

Governor.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., July 22, 1861.

Governor A. G. CURTIN,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

Form a new regiment as proposed if possible, and it will be mustered in as soon as reported.

By order of the Secretary of War:

J. LESLEY, JR.,

Chief Clerk.
