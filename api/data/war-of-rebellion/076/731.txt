at Morrow's yesterday and it seemed a good point, but examine well. I do not think the enemy will attack now, because Howard is within 800 yards of the railroad at Jonesborough, intrenched. He has three bridges and feels strong, but the darkness of night prevented him reaching the road, but he was to resume operations at daylight. I have ordered one of Davis' divisions down to Renfroe's, and expect to send the whole to Howard's flank, but will keep Stanley near him, but will soon send him to the right and let you stand the brunt if Hardee comes out of Rough and Ready. He has some works about the Mount Zion Church, and likely has his corps there. It is not as good as yours. I don't wish you to attack it in position, but to hold it and as much more as possible, for the other which is the real attack. After selecting your ground feel the enemy with skirmishers, and if possible you may push in a strong party by Thames' Mill, aiming to reach the railroad about two miles below Rough and Ready. This can only be done, of course, in case of what I want to prevent-Hood fronting Howard with all his combined force. Relieve Howard all you can, but prepare to take advantage of all successes. I want Garrard's cavalry the moment you can spare him, and you can spare him the moment you have a good flank. Colonel Garrard with his cavalry can serve as vedettes. The moment you can spare Garrard send him to me. I send Audenried to you, who will describe to you the roads, positions, fields of grass, corn, &amp;c.

Captain Audenried has just handed me your dispatch of this morning and explained your wishes. My troops are now massing near Stanely's left, and reconnoitering the ground toward the mill. I will get my troops into the desired position without delay, and then commence to demonstrate against Hardee and toward the railroad. I will do all I can to carry out your instructions.
