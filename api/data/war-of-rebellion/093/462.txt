Thirty-third Missouri, was seriously wounded; Captain McKelvy and Lieutenant Potter, of Seventh Minnesota, slightly wounded; 11 men were killed and 89 wounded.

I cannot too highly commend the gallant conduct of all the officers and men of the brigade; no troops ever behaved more gallantly. The Twelfth Iowa had not a single line officer, owing to the recent muster-out of non-veterans, yet their conduct was none the less soldierly and brave.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

There were captured by my command in the two days' engagement, 5 12-pounders guns-4 brass, 1 steel-(exclusive of the 2 Napoleon's conceded to Colonel Hubbard, which would have made the number 7), 5 caissons, 1 battery wagon, about 500 prisoners, and 2 battle-flags.

There was expended, by Captain Julian's battery, 2,000 rounds of 3-inch shell and solid shot; by the infantry, mostly by the skirmishers, about 7,000 rounds of rifle-musket ammunition.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

In accordance with instructions from your headquarters, I had my men under arms at 6 o'clock on the morning of the 15th, and at a few minutes after 8 moved outside our line of works and formed line to the right of the Hardin pike; my regiment formed the right of our brigade line; afterward being ordered to the left, I moved my regiment to the left of the pike and formed as the left center of the brigade line. We then threw forward a heavy line of skirmishers, and awaited the forming of the general line.

Our main line advanced steadily and without opposition, constantly changing our point of direction toward the left, until we had advanced two miles, when, coming on to the crest of a hill, we were opened on by one of the enemy's batteries, posted directly in our front and distant about 1,000 yards. Our men were then ordered to lie down, and our brigade battery brought forward and opened fire on the enemy. We here held in this position for about an hour and a half, the enemy keeping up a constant fire on our line, doing us but little damage.

We were then moved forward, swinging
