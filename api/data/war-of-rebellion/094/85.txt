NASHVILLE, TENN., December 7, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

The enemy has not increased his force in our front. Have sent gun-boats up the river above Carthage; one returned to-day and reported no signs of the enemy on the river-bank from forty miles above Carthage to this place. Captain Fitch, U. S. Navy, started down the river yesterday with a convoy of transport steamers, but was unable to get them down, the enemy having planted three batteries on a send of the river between this and Clarksville, Captain Fitch was unable to silence all three of the batteries yesterday, and will return again to-morrow morning, and, with the assistance of the Cincinnati, now at Clarksville, I am in hopes will now be able to clear them out. So far the enemy have not materially injured the nashville and Chattanooga Railroad.
