Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have sent orders to General Sherman to move east toward Stevenson, leaving everything unguarded, except by the way of the Army of the Cumberland, east of Bear Creek. The possibility of the enemy breaking through our lines east of this, and present inability to follow him from there, if he should, is the cause of this order. Sherman's forces are the only troops I could throw in to head such a move.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
