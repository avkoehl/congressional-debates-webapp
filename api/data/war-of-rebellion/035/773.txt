IN CAMP NEAR TULLAHOMA, TENN.,

April 15, [1863]

DEAR BROTHER: * * * Our army at this place is Hardee's corps, with Breckinridge's and Cleburne's divisions; Breckinridge's composed of Adams', Brown's, Preston's, and B. H. Helm's brigades. Helm commands the Kentucky brigade, composed of the Second, Fourth, Sixth, and Ninth Kentucky Regiments, whose loss at the recent battle at Murfreesborough was heavier than any other brigade. It was commanded then by Brigadier General Roger [W.] Hanson. Cleburne's division is composed of Lucius [E.] Polk's, Liddell's, Johnson's, and Wood's brigades, making an aggregate of about 19,000 men. Polk's corps (Cheatham's, McCown's, and Withers' divisions) are at Shelbyville, about 15 miles west of this place. The two corps contain about 35,000 or 40,000 effective infantry. Morgan's command is at McMinnville, about 30 miles northeast, with 6,000 or 8,000 cavalry; Wharton's north, toward Murfreesborough, with about 2,000 at Beech Grove; Forrest and Van Dorn at Columbia with about 10,000, operating against Nashville and its envious and very successfully. Thus, you see, our army is not so small as some suppose it to be, nor have I overestimated the figures.

The troops are in good spirits, and are confident of success when an engagement takes place, and, if the weather continues good, we expect it soon, although the enemy have not yet advanced from their stronghold at Murfreesborough. Morgan's (assorted) command are still in Southeastern Kentucky. Pegram has met with indifferent success in his late raid there. The health of our army is good.*

Your brother.
