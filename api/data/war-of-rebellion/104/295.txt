There he will form, together with the First Division, the extreme right of the investing army, resting his right on the river. General Smith, commanding Sixteenth Corps, marches with the First and Third Divisions and all his artillery by either of the pontoon bridges toward the invested place, together with the Second Division already there completes the lines on left, resting his left on the river and extending his right across the Pensacola and Blakely road. General Steele will occupy with the divisions of C. C. Andrews and Hawkins the intermediate ground between General Granger's left and General Smith's right.
