in large force. I think it advisable for you to send me a full regiment at once, as the fort is large to hold them efficiently in addition to the troops I have. Artillery enough in the fort and all inside.

PILOT KNOB, September 26, 1864.

Major-General SMITH:

It may be advisable to move the regiment at Mineral Point by sending it here, or taking it to De Soto, as the enemy are certainly in force enough to whip, if not capture, it. I have ordered the colonel commanding to keep his locomotives supplied with wood and water, and all ready for prompt movement, and if the road is cut north of him to fall back here, and if south to fall back to De Soto. Advise as to further movements of that regiment.

THOMAS EWING, Jr.,

Brigadier-General.

PILOT KNOB, September 26, 1864.

Major-General SMITH:

I have four companies of your command here and one regiment is at Mineral Point, where I suppose you are; the other companies I brought from De Soto, and four companies at Irondale and at the two Big River bridges.

ROLLA, September 26, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

The Osage can be crossed at this stage of water everywhere; it is merely a succession of pools. (See Morrill's survey.) The Gasconade is almost a dry river and can be waded from its mouth to its source. No attention need be paid to fords on either stream.
