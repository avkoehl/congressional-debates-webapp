Captain RAMSEY,Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. Dept. of the Cumberland, Nashville:

CAPTAIN: As supplementary to my report of my operations in North Alabama, directed to be sent in by the major-general commanding, I inclose a copy of a letter from Major-General Steedman, which left me free to make the expedition after the enemy's pontoon train or not, as I might deem best.

i am, captain, your obedient servant,

WM. J. PALMER,

Colonel, commanding.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE ETOWAH, Courtland, Ala., December 30, 1864-5.15 p. m.

Colonel WILLIAM J. PALMER,Commanding Cavalry:

COLONEL: Your dispatch just received. The infantry, if it should move now, could not reach Leighton before 2 a. m. to-morrow. You will, therefore, have to exercise your own judgement as to whether you can safely make the expedition without support from the infantry. It is fair to suppose that the pontoon train has a guard at least equal to your own horses, but leave you free to make the expedition, if you think twenty-five of your men for courier duty. Please inform me whether you pursue the train or not.

By command of Major-General Steedman:

S. B. MOE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Numbers 230. Medals of Honor awarded for distinguished services under Resolution of Congress, Numbers 43. approved July 12, 1862, and section 6 of Act of Congress approved March 3, 1863.
