yesterday returning. Have brought them here for burial. I learn that about 150 guerrillas have arrived in this vicinity within the last week, 80 or whom have been seen northeast of this place. I am satisfied that they have sufficient force, when concentrated, to take all the stations in your sub-district, and am of the opinion that they intend to try it. Morning report shows 56 privates here for duty, 40 or whom are out now on a scout. The 15 men will start out as per order to-night. Have not got the men to send out in Lieutenant Spencer's place. Have ordered the forage train not to go to Hickman.

Cannot send escort with main until our scouts return, which will be to-morrow.

Major O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Cassville, Mo.:

Major Melton, commanding at Berryville, reports that he has what he considers reliable information that General Shelby is on the Osage below him, with 2,000 men and six pieces of artillery, and is conscripting everybody. If he advances I shall withdraw the troops from Berryville and probably Cassville, as the stock is so weak that I cannot re-enforce those places in time to do any good, and it is difficult to hold them against artillery. I shall go from here to Mount Vernon to-day and home to-morrow.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,In the Field, May 27, 1864.

Major MELTON,

Berryvile, Ark.:

Send out scouts and spies immediately and ascertain whether Shelby is in that country or not and has artillery. The parties sent out shall be paid. If Shelby is there with any such force as you report you will fall back immediately to this place-that is, if he contemplates advancing. Have your scouts ascertain this. Seize and use all means of transportation in the vicinity, and any property that you cannot bring out destroy. If Shelby continues to advance after you reach this point, you will fall back toward Springfield or Mount Vernon as you may hereafter be ordered. I shall leave here this morning. You will put your command in readiness to move at once.

Yours, &amp;c.,

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

P. S.-If your information is such that you have no doubt of its correctness, you will move at once, but I cannot see how 2,000 men can line there a single day.

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
