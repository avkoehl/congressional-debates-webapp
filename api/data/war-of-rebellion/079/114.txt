General CORSE, Commanding, Allatoona:

DEAR GENERAL: This evening I got a signal from you giving me the first real intelligence of the safety of Allatoona and of your wound. At some future time I will add my high appreciation of your services, but now I want to prevent any more misehief to our roads. Allatoona is now safe on this front. Leave enough to cover the bridge to the rear as against a cavalry dash and send all you can spare back to Rome, to assure* the safety of that place, although in the end I suppose I will have to use the iron on that road and to destroy the town. I doubt if any force of Hood wil cross the Etowah, but still it may. I will tomorrow continue to demonstrate against him and make him keep his people together. Unless your wound is too severe, exercise a general command, for you head is worth than a dozen of any I have to spare. I have sent these orders by signal, but fear they may reach you mutilated. If possible, get a message in cipher up to Chattanooga for them to work this way whilst we work the road back. We have abundance of food, but little forage.

Yours, truly,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major - General, Commanding.
