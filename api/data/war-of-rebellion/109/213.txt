SIR: Assistant Secretary Scott, writing from Cairo, reports that the 600 soldiers ordered to be sent from here to man the flotilla at Cairo are not an adequate force, and that 800 more are required. I would therefore request that in view of the important operations of that flotilla you should immediately send the additional force specified.
