General BIRNEY:

If the enemy are in earnest you will next hear of them on your left.

Look to that a little.

HEADQUARTERS, EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 25, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

It was reported to me, between 1 and 2 a. m. to-day, that only 700 of the 1,800 that started yesterday to relieve Ames reported; the rest straggled on the road, so that I did not relieve Ames. I will order such as were relieved to be forwarded at once. General Meade informed me yesterday he had positive information that Mahone was to relieve Pickett, and I concluded the force in my front to be Pickett's. Shall I send General Ames, now, out of the trenches?

E. O. ORD,

Major-General.

General BIRNEY:

Forwarded for the information of General Birney. Do you think that it is necessary to bring Ames out of the trenches?

What could cause so much straggling?

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

Major-General BUTLER,

Commanding:

I only wish Ames to consummate the exchange. I feel quite confident of holding my front with my present force.

Major-General.
