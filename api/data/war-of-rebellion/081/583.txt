HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,City Point, July 2, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

I have directed Butler to have Kent, the Tribune correspondent, arrested and sent to these headquarters. As soon as he arrives I will send him to your provost-marshal-general for such disposition as you deem fit to make of him. If you desire it I will order him away from the army, not to return, either before or after sending him to you.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

JULY 2, 1864-10.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The exclusion of Mr. Kent from the armies around Richmond will, in my judgment, answer all purposes. I proposed his being turned over to the provost-marshal-general, Army of the Potomac, in order to over to the provost-marshal-general, Army of the Potomac, in order to bring him before a military commission for trial on the charge of publishing false intelligence for a malicious purpose; but this is probably attaching more importance to the individual than he deserves.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,City Point, July 2, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

On inquiry Mr. Kent is found to have gone North. I have directed notice to be sent to him that his pass to visit army is revoked, and that he will not be allowed to return.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, July 2, 1864-2 p.m.

General GEORGE G. MEADE:

Please detail 150 men as an additional guard for the general herd of cattle, now numbering some 3,000, and being grazed or directed to be grazed on the James River, near Coggins Point. Direct the detail to report to Captain W. R. Murphy, commissary of subsistence, in charge of herd. It would be a further protection to locate the camp for the dismounted cavalry at Coggins Point while waiting to be mounted, if it can be done without inconvenience.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

[Indorsement.]

General WILLIAMS:

Let this detail be made at once, and advise General Sheridan of the wishes of the lieutenant-general commanding.

G. G. M[EADE].
