HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Suffolk, Va., May-, 1863.

MAJOR: In compliance with orders from headquarters I respectfully submit the following report as to the operations on the Edenton and Somerton roads and the line of defenses under my command, extending from Fort Nansemond to Fort Halleck, during the late investment of this place by the enemy:

On Saturday, April 11, it being reported that the enemy was advancing against this place, I immediately repaired to my front and had all the troops placed under arms and ready for action. The enemy did not, however, advance within sight, and this condition of affairs remained until Monday afternoon following, when an advance was made
