General Pleasonton clams to be here under the direct orders of General Hooker, with certain plans to carry out. Please inform me whether I am responsible for the defense of this part of the river, and whether I have command of all the troops in the vicinity.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY,May 5, 1863 - 3.45 p. m.

General BUTTERFIELD, Chief of Staff:

Two brigades of rebels can be seen moving toward Hamilton's Crossing; eleven wagons following first brigade. A regiment can also be seen in rifle-pits on the ridge back of Fredericksburg. If you have pushed them to-day, this would indicate a retrograde movement. Have the rebels any means of crossing below Fredericksburg? Perhaps they have a pontoon train we know nothing of.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
