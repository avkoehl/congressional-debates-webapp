CAPE GIRARDEAU, June 10, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding:

I have obeyed every order of yours. I have all my men in the saddle. I have but 16 for duty this morning. I hope to hear that they kill all of these swamp thieves. The line to New Madrid is all right this morning, the first time for a week.

Will keep you posted as far as I can.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, June 10, 1864.

I am inclined to think Kitchen is below you, and that is the reason they try so hard to keep the line down. I would suggest that you send reliable scouts below. Also send a party up toward Charleston each day, to meet my men, so as to keep the line up. I have 200 men between you and Charleston. If you get any further news let me know at once, and I will assist you with every man I can spare. Show your teeth.
