to level them. The fort, therefore, should be made capable of withstanding the battering of breaching batteries and still be secure against assault. Its isolated position on the southern coast makes this the more important.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel A. S. HARTWELL,

55th Massachusetts Vols., Commanding Post of Folly Island:

COLONEL: By direction of the brigadier-general commanding I have the honor to invite your attention to the following extract from the report of October 13, instant of Captain Thomas L. Appleton, Fifty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, provost-marshal, Northern District, Department of the South:

The whole force on Long Island is, commissioned officers, 6; enlisted men, 192; which is not enough to do the duty as it ought to be done. The island is 3 miles long and I only found six posts at the front, where there should have been double that number.

The brigadier-general commanding directs that you will cause the number of posts to be increased if it can be done without detriment to the service, and that you will report your action in the matter without delay to these headquarters.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

STUART M. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Some slight movements of the enemy at other points require us to be on the alert.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
