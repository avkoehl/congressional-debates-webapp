attack from some of our forces upon their rear, and that they were fronting toward Richmond. (I do not know enough about military matters to understand the latter portion of that, but those are his words.) He states that the rebel General Thomas was killed yesterday, General McGowan's eft arm was broken, General Scales is missing; cavalry J. E. B. Stuart is slightly wounded but still on duty; General Pettigrew wounded, but on duty; Colonel Brown, Fourteenth South Carolina Regiment, killed. If this mand could be escorted to army headquarters he could perhaps impart some useful information. He exhibits every evidence of sincerity. If he is required I shall expect him to be returned to me, as I have employed him, he not being a slave. Please excuse this pencil scrawling, as I cannot procure ink.

I am, captain, &amp;c.,

CHARLES E. CADY.
