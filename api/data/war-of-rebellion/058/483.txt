HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, February 27, 1864

Major General J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

Longstreet having gone, cannot you now send a regiment and two pieces of artillery to guard the bridge at the Hiwassee? Every man we can spare is now engaged before Dalton, and the enemy has a cavalry force largely superior to ours, and the bridge over the Hiwassee would be a difficult one to replace. Colonel Long, who was at Calhoun, is now guarding the left flank of our army.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Ringgold, February 27, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Brigadier-General CRUFT,

Commanding First Division, Fourth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The general commanding the department directs that Brigadier-General Cruft, return to his late camp at Blue Springs, accompanied by Colonel Long, to cover his right flank, after which Colonel Long will proceed to Cleveland and await further orders.

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General, Commanding.

FLAT CREEK, February 27, 1864

Major-General GRANGER:

General Whipple asks for a regiment and two pieces of artillery to guard the Hiwassee bridge. Send them if you think they can be spared from Sheridan's division. You have nothing to fear from this direction. Telegraph me, also General Whipple, what you can do.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, February 27, 1864

General SCHOFIELD,

Flat Creek:

I have a man just in from Morristown; left there Thursday night. He says the rebels are all gone; the last left the night he did. They removed everything they had. The cavalry were going up the French Broad road; the infantry to Virginia, a portion to stop at the salt-works, the balance to go to Mobile. This he says is reliable.

R. A. CRAWFORD,

Colonel and Chief of Police.

MADISONVILLE, TENN.,

February 27, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourth Army Corps:

I have the honor to report that one of my scouting parties has just returned from Sevierville, which place they left yesterday morning.
