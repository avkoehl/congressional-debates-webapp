Major General AMBROSE E. BURNSIDE, U. S. Volunteers,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I am instructed to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 29th ultimo, in reference to sending the Third Division, First Army Corps, to the State of Pennsylvania for recruitment. The same is answered by the following indorsement of the General-in-Chief:

JANUARY 3, 1863.

There are numerous applications of this kind on file in regard to regiments from other States, which have been greatly reduced in recent battles. If granted in one it must be in al similar cases, which would the armies in the field as not only to prevent any further operations for three or four three or four months, but to endanger important positions now held by us. The War Department has uniformly refused applications of this kind, and I cannot, at the present time, advise a different policy.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Approved.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

The attention of the State authorities has been invited to the evils resulting from the present system of selecting officers for the organization.
