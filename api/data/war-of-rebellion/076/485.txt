Major J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Ohio:

MAJOR: Colonel Garrard reported last evening an appearance of increased cavalry force in his front pressing him closely. I therefore marched General Reilly's brigade across from the Campbellton road to the Sandtown road, and put them in camp on that road beyond the hospitals, &amp;c., and just in rear of the cavalry camp. I put Colonel Stiles' brigade between the Sandtown road and General Hascall's headquarters, where I had one regiment the night before, and placed Colonel Casement's brigade in his old works just in rear of the line where he relieved part of General Hascall's command two days ago.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. D. COX,
