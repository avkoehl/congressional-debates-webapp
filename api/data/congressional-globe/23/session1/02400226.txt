THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 10 
emor with the Legislature of Virginia as a most
auspicious omen, which would have salutary-
influence elsewhere, after investigating the pnnci-
pies upon wmch the Government was founded, he
could not conceive in what way he had transcended
his official limits.   For this inoffensive matter,
however, this act is to be classed along with the
manifesto of the President, and with other danger-
ous assumptions of power on the part of the Exec-
utive, and the Goveinor, when about to retue into
his wilderness, is sought to be made as a scape-
goat to cover other executive assumptions.   He
would not pretend to say that the sacrifice would
be so accepted by the people, but he might be per-
mitted to say that so long as there was on the
watch-tower a person so cautious as his colleague,
little danger   could arise from the Governor's
assumptions.    He must deny, as alleged by his
colleague, that the State Legislatuie, in adopting
theseiesolutions, had abandoned the ancient prin-
ciples which the State had so long acted upon, and
he referred to the various numbers voting on the
several resolutions adopted by the Legislature to
show that public opinion was not misrepresented
by the votes by which they were severally passed,
and which, as they varied in number, proved that
the members of the Legislature had been actuated
by a deep sense of the responsibility which devolved
upon them    They had judged each resolution
upon us own proper merits, and, as he was happy
to inform the House, they had not m that Legisla-
tor e any party machinery, caucuses, or conven-
tions, which were ultimately destined, instead of
representing, to bury the voice of the people     His '
colleague had objected to the preamble ot the reso-
lutions    But while Virginia had enough of abuse
heaped upon her, while she had been denounced
by the press, abused as being second only to South
Carolina, he little expected to find one of her sons,
and one of whom she was justly proud, joining
with those who wished to expose her, and he might
be permitted  to wish that, after the excitement
which prevailed in debate had subsided, his hon-
orable colleague, m his cooler moments, had not
reiterated his objections in the terms he did, but
that he wouid have dropped a tear of regret upon
them, and have blotted them out forever.
Mr G .afteradvertmgtotheargumentsadduced
to maintain the power of the President over the
Tieasuiy, contended that their great error was in
supposing that the Treasuiy Depaitment was an
executive one, and he refened to the proceedings
of the conventions held m New York, Virginia,
Massachusetts, and Pennsylvania, to show that it
was not consideied so, either prior to, or by the
articles of, the Constitution itself The position
that had been assumed was, that the Piesident.m
his executive character, being responsible to the
people, had the right of supervision 01 control,
and could remove irom office such officers only as
were gi\en to aid him in the discharge of his
executive duties He did not conceive that the
President had any right to remove fi om office those
who were not responsible to him, for a mei e d 'ffer
ence of opinion , and he argued to prove that if the
dccjrmes maintained, that the President had this
umcstncted right of removal, were correct, that
ultimately he must ingulf all the powers vested by
the Constitution m all the other branches of the
Government
Mr G proceeded to a-gue that the power of
removing thedeposites was notan executive power
The very fact that the Secretary was obliged to
comeheie with his reasons was sufficient Voof
of the fact that Congress intended to render the
Secretary independent of the Pi esidert in the exer-
cise of the power of removing the deposites The
President had powers in reference to the lank, but
o. a diffeient natuie fiom this He could issje a
scire facias against the bank, and try the question
oí its alleged violation of the charter But the
Resident says he had not time to issue a sene
facias, and that he must, therefore, m order to see
the laws faithfully executed, remove thedeposi es,
and remove the Seci eta  y of the Treasury in order
to remove the deposites This construction of
executive duties, Mi G pionouneed to be dan- i
gerous as well as absmd                                            '
Mi   G  then passed to the consideration of the j
mmcmles contended for by the Secretary m his
íeasons,, and isked, who had made the Secretory
the political and moral monitor of the nation  Who
had authorized him to travel beyond the laws and
his leger to pick up newspaper charges against the
bank, and exert his financial powers for the pres-
ervation of the public morals, &c. He averied
that the Secretary had not offered one single finan-
cial reason for his act
Mr G submitted to the House whether a single
evil alleged as a reason for the removal of the de-
posites had been avoided or cured by the act.
The Secretary knew that the bank was a hard
master, reaping where it had not sown, and it was
his duty to foresee the results of his rash measure.
It was his duty to know that the act would not
only embarrass the business of the country, but
would, by diminishing the revenue one third in
amount, lender necessary a resoit to an increased
tariff of duties.   Mr G could not help coming to
the conclusion that there were other reasons for
the act than those which met the eye.   He could
hardly believe that the Secretary himself was sat-
isfied with the reasons which he had presented.
His impressions were strengthened by the fact that
Mr. Dnane, m.his third letter, states that the Pres-
ident had said of the last Congress,'that if it had
sat one week longer it would have been bribed by
the bank to renew its charter, and that the same
would be the case with this Congress if he did not
interfere by removing  the deposites before  the
commencementofthesession.    Heasked whether
the House was prepared to sustain the President
in acts which were founded on such suspicions ?
He himself felt assured, and upon his representa-
tive responsibility he would express his belief, that
the President asked and used the influence of per-
sons who were unworthy of his confidence     He
compared his administration to the reign of Eliza-
beth, beginning in biightness and glory, and end-
ing, through the influence of bad counsels, m dis-
grace arid gloom.  The cry of " Recharter, rechar-
ter," which was raised whenever the subject was
touched, was wholly unfounded   The whole of
the southern States, in a body, were opposed to
the recharter of the bank    The President, the
Vice President, ard a majority of this House were
opposed to a recharter, and the object, whoever
might have itmview, was altogether unattainable.
For Jiimself he thanked the chairman of the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means for his second resolu-
tion, that " the bank oughtnot to be «chartered,"
and would support it.    But he wished to see the
mjuiy done to the Constitution and to pubhcfaith,
by the íemovalof the deposites, repaned by their
restoration
Mr MOORE,of Virginia, spoke in earnest vin-
dication of Governor Floyd from the charge of
having addressed an offensive and improper letter
to the Representatives of Virginia   If the Governor
had committed an offence, he was entitled to a fair
trial, and to be confronted with his accusers   But
to drag the Goveinor to the bar of this House, to
answer to the House, as judge* and accusers, for
an offence against the dignity of its measures, was
a measure which the sense of the House would
revott at     For his part, he would rather that the
waves of the ocean should roll over the State and
blot itout forevei, lhan that it should undergo such
a degradation    His colleague had asked where
Governor * loyd had got his notions     I can tell
the gentleman    He got them in the mountains of
Virginia, where men aie as free as the air which
they breathe   He would suggest, too, that if Gov-
ernor Tioyd had no right to comment upon the
course of the Virginia delegation, his colleague had
no right to comment upon the R chmond resolu-
tions     It is settled bv the practice of the House
that a man might abuse his own constituent-!, but
not that he may call in question the views of those
who are not rus constituents    It seemed that his
colleague had heard a voice from Virginia, diffei-
ing from the sentiments of the Legislature   It was
true, that the question of removing the deposites
had sunk into insignificance    It was now a ques-
tion between hoerty and slavery, and it was much
to be feared that the removal of the deposites was
but the hist m a series of measures by which it
was designed to transform our institutions into a
corrupt monaichy, based on the influence of office-
holders and State banks     He spoke much of th 
danger tobe appieherded from theforty thousand
office holders, and stated that the danger from this
course of a consolidation of powers m the Govern-
ment had ear'y attracted the attention of the Le-
gislature of Virginia    The talk about the political
influence of the bank was absurd.    In the great
State of Pennsylvania, where last year the Legis-
lature voted unanimously m favor of the bank.lhe
National Administration was stronger than in any
other State.    If the bank could not control the
politics of the State where it is located, how idle it
was to apprehend its influence over the politics of
other States.    The people could not much longer
be deceived.    The southern merchants when they
go to New York to buy goods, and find that they
have to pay four or five per cent, discount on their
money, will come home and tell their neighbors
what is the effect, and what is the object of the ex-
periment of the Administration.    He would sug-
gest to the advisers of a specie medium, the expe-
diency of fiist trying the experiment of depriving
the people of the facilities and comforts which they
have derived from the paper system.   The ser-
vices of General Jackson would not much longer
blind the people to the fact that he is under im-
proper influence.   The day of reckoning was at
hand.   The people would require an account of
the twenty-two millions which had been squan-
deied during the last year.    He knew the opera-
tions by which the public sentiment of Virginia
was to be revolutionized, but he was also certain
that they would fail of effect.    The people of Vir-
ginia would not be reduced to political prostitution
by the offei of the Vice Presidency to Virginia.
He did not know that it had been offered, but he
expected soon to see, in some distant newspaper,
the nomination of a son of Virginia as the next
Vice President.   Mr M , in conclusion, alluded to
the party divisions of Virginia which now weak-
ened her strength, and declared his belief that those
dissensions would soon vanish, and that the whole
State would present an undivided  front against
executive abuses and usurpations
Mr. PINCKNEY rose and said, he must deny
the right that was assumed by the member from Vn -
gima, [Mr. Patton,] on a former day, to censure
the convention and other proceedings which were
held in South Carolina; but as the State had been
thus assailed, he hoped he might be permitted to
defend it. Upon this occasion, he felt he must
lament the want of that member from Virginia
whom they had so lately followed to the grave,
[Mr.BotjLDiN,] for he would not have thus charged
South Carolina, but would have thrown himself
into the breach, and have gallantly maintained the
rights of South Carolina, as he would have his
own beloved Virginia He was the steadfast ad-
vocate of State rights It was a remarkable fact,
that this worthy successor of Randolph, and dyin°-
with that name upon his lips, shortly previous to
his death, stated to him (Mr. P.) that he had de-
fended his State from charges similar to those which
had been preferred against her
The gentleman said South Carolina had acted
"rashly " He should like, if so, to know what
constituted prudence Was it not notorious that
she petitioned,and by her Legislature sent remon-
strances to Congress for ten long years' And with
what result >—-that her petitions and remonstrances
were treated with neglect, until at length that act
(the tariff) was passed, which went to make her
slaves to the North, and filled up the measureof her
degradation Would the honorable member from
Virginia have had hei fold her arms and make no
effort in her own defence > But the men who were
thus charged with acting "rashly" well under-
stood the perils of their situation They looked,
however, to the consequences, they looked to the
cost, they found there was nothing so intolerable
to bear as the chains of slavery that were forged
for them                                                                  °
The gentleman said if they were not so lash,
Carolina would have pot better terms, but he con-
tended tha* what they desired they had generally
obtained Although there were some objectionable
provisions in the compromise bdl, yet she obtained
by her own exertions, much that was substan-
tal and valuable, for which she had contended.
He would ask, what better terms could she have
made The compromise bill, bad as it might be
in some respects, found no favoi fiom the Admm-
istiation.and if it were not for the exertions of the
distinguished statesmen, whom Caro'm i honored,
little indeed would the South have obtained at their
hands He would here remark, that hereafter,as
the people of Carolina now knew their situation,
