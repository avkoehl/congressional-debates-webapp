Send your best scout to Jackson with my orders to General Smith to push down as rapidly as possible, crossing at Bolivar or wherever else he can get over, that the main body of the enemy is on this side.

Your dispatch received. Will start the scout to Smith immediately. Colonels Prince and Trafton, of the Seventh Illinois, have arrived with most of the regiment. Our loss was small. Enemy reported at Somerville. Have ordered Mizner, on his arrival at Corinth, if he cannot communicate by telegraph, to move southwest toward Riples.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I regret to have to inform you that the lameness from which I was suffering when I left Washington was so much increased by the ride over the mountains as to prevent my riding or moving about, except with great pain. I determined, however, to get along as well as I could, but on the 23rd my horse, in passing over an inclined ledge of rocks, fell and caught my wounded leg under him. This has disabled me so that it is impossible to perform the duties on the field, made necessary by the presence of the active enemy in front. I am, therefore, forced to ask to be relieved, and wish that it may be done
