commencing at 3 p.m., and will be conducted to their division by the shorter route by a staff officer from these headquarters. The nature of the movement the command is about to make is such that its success will depend to a considerable extent, if not entirely, upon the discipline and steadiness of the troops. Commanders are enjoined to take effectual measures to prevent straggling. The men will be instructed, in case my of them fall into the hands of the enemy, to give only their names and regiments, and no information which will disclose the strength of the command.

By order of Major-General Hancock:

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, July 26, 1864-6.07 p.m.

The command will march to the Point of Rocks, on the Appomattox, in the order in which the troops are now moving. On arriving at a point near that place the divisions will mass in succession, taking great care not to pass over any ground before massing which can be seen from the opposite side of the river. Commanders will await orders at that point, but if the leading division moves out the other troops will follow.

By order of Major-General Hancock:

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

No fires will be built at any halt.

By order of Major-General Hancock:
