bursement, and to have their notes received a¡> cash
m the dues of the Government. I then asked jf we
had a right to make such a bargain'' The Senator,
leaving out all these particulars, represented me as
saying that the Government had no right to make a
bargain with the banks, and then undertakes to in-
volve me jn an inconsistency, m supporting the
bill, because it proposes to bargain with the banks
for the use of their vaults, as a place of safe keep-
ing for the public money as if there was a possible
analogy between the two cases Nothing is more
easy than to refute the most demonsirative argu
ment in this way. Drop an essential part of the
premises, and the most irresistible conclusion of
cour e f nK
In the same summary and easy modf of íeply-
nng tD my arguments, the Senator perverted my de-
nial that the Government had a right to receive
bank notes as cash, into the assertion that it had
no right to receive any thmg but cash, and then
accuse1: me with inconsistency, because I voted, at
the extra session, for the bill authorizing the receipt
of Treasury notes m the dues of the Government,
as if any one ever doubted that it could receive its
own paper, or securities in payment of its debK
Such are the miss atements of the Senator, taken in
their regular order, as they stand in his reply, and
they present a fair specimen of what he chooses to
consider an answ er to my argument. There is not
one less unfairly stated, or unfairly met, than the
instances I have cited
The Senator presented two difficulties in reply to
what I said against receiving bank notes by the
Government, which demand a passing notice be-
fore I dismiss this part of the subject He ob-
jected, first, that it was contrary to the provision of
the bit1 itself, which authorizes the receipts of the
notes of specie-paying banks for a limited time i
To answer this objection, it «ill be necessary to
advert to the object of the provision. By the pro-
visions of the joint resolution of 1816, the nctes of
specie pav ing banks are made receivable m the
dues of the Government, and, of course, on the
resumption of specie payments, bank notes would
again be received by the Government as hereto-
fore, without limitation as to time, unless some
provision be adopted to prevent it In a word, the
Gov ernment, though separated m fact at present
Irom the banks, is not legally separated, and the
object of the provision is to effect the separation
as -Hell m law as it is in fact This it proposes 10
d) by a gradual repeal of the joint resolution of
1816, m order to prevent, as far as possible, any
injurious effects to the community or the banks
The Senator, in making his objection, overlooks
the broad distinction between the doing and un-
doing of an unconstitutional act There are some
unconstitutional acts that are difficult, if not im-
possible, to be undone, such, for instance, as the
a dmission oí Louisiana mto the Union, admitting
it to be unconstitutional, which I do not. There
are others which cannot be undone suddenly,
without wide spread distress and rum, such as the
protective tariff, which, accordingly, the compro-
mise act allowed upwards of eight years for the
gradual lepeal Such also is the case under con-
sideration, which, under the provisions of the bill,
would be eflected in seven years. In all such cases
1 hold it to be not only clearly constitutional for
Congiess to make a giadual repeal, but its duty to
do so, otherwise it would be often impossible to
get cleai of an unconstitutional act short of a revo-
luti in His next objection was, that the reasons
which would make the receipt of bank notes un-
constitutional, would also make theCnma trade so,
w Inch he represented as absorbing a large portion
of the specie of the country. There is no analogy
whatever between the two cases. The very object
of specie is to cany on trade, and it would be idle
to attempt to regulate the distubution and fluctua-
tion which result from its operation Experience
proves that all attempts of the kind must either
prove abortive or mischievous. In fact, it may be
laid down as a law, that the more universal the
demand for specie, and the less that demand is in-
terrupted, the moie steady and uniform its value,
and the more perfect!), of course, it fulfils the
gieat puipose of circulation, for which it was in-
tended     Theie  are, however,  not a few who,
12
Waking public officers depositaries—Mr. Calk
taking a different view, have thought it to he the
duty of the Government to prohibit the exportation
of specie to China, on the very ground w hieh the
Senator alsumes, and I am not certain but that he
himself has been m favor of the measnre.
But the Senator did not restrict himself to a reply
to my arguments. He introduced personal re-
marks, which neither self-respect, nor a regard to
the cause I support, will permit me to pass without
notice, as adverse as I am to all personal controver-
sies. Not only my education and disposition, but,
above all, my conception of the duties belonging to
the stat.on I occupy, indisposes me to such con-
troversies We are sent here, not to wrangle, or
indulge in personal abuse, but to deliberate and
decide on the common interests of the S ates of this
Union, as far as th-y hav e been sUbj cted by the
Constitution to our jurisdiction Trus thinking
and feeling, and having perfect confidence m the
cause I support, I addressed mj self, when I was
last up, directly and exclusively to the understand-
ing, carefully avoiding every remark which had the
leasr personal or party bearing In proof of this,
I appeal to you, Senators, my witnesses and judges
on this occasion But it seems that no caution on
my part could prevent what I was so anxious to
avoid The Senator, having no pretext to give a
personal direction to the discussion, made a preme-
ditated and gratuitous attack on me I say having
no pretext, for there is not a shadow of foundation
for the assertion that I called on him and his party
to follow my lead, at which he scemeá to take of-
fence, as I have already shown I made no such
call, or any thing that could be construed into it
It would have been impertinent, in the relation be-
tween myself and his party, at any «tage of this
question, and absurd at ibat late period, when
eveiy Senator had made up h s mind As there
was, th-n, neither provoeaticn no> pre ext, what
could be the motive of the Senatoi m making the
attack' It could not be to indulge in the pleasure
of personal abuse, the lowest and basest oí all our
passions, and which is so far beneath the dignity of
the Senator's character and station. Nor could it
be with the view to intimidation. The Senator
knows me too long and too well to make such an
attempt I am sent here by constituents as respec-
table as those he represents, in order to watch over
their peculiar interests, and take care of the gene-
ral concern, and if I were capable of being deteired
by any one, or any consequence, in discharging my
duty, from denouncing what I regarded as danger-
ous or corrupt, or giving a decided and zealous
support to what I thought right and expedient, I
would, m shame and confusion, return my com-
mission to the patriotic ard gallant State I repre-
sent to fee placed in more resolute and trustworthy
hands
If, then, neither the one nor the other of these be
the motive, what I repeat, can it be'J In casting
my eyes over the whole surface I can see but one,
which is, that the Senator, despairing of the suffi-
ciency of his reply to overthiow my arguments, had
resorted to personalities, in the hope, w th their aid,
to effect what he could not accomplish by mam
strength He well knows that the force of an ar-
gument on moral or political subjects depends
greatly on the character of him who advanced it,
and that to cast suspicion on his sincerity or mo
tive, or to shake confidence m his understanding, is
often the most effectual mode to destroy its force
Thus viewed, hi  personalities may be fairly le-
garded as constituting a part of his reph to my ar-
gument, and we, accordingly, find the Senator
throning them in front, like a skilful general, m
ordei to weaken my arguments before he brought
on his mam attack In repelling, then, his person-
al attacks, I also defend the cause whicn I advo-
cate It is against that his blows are aimea, and
he strikes at it through me, because he believes
his blows w ill be the more effectual
Having given this diiection to his reply, he has
imposed on me a double duty to repel his attacks
duty to myself and the cause I support I shall not
deel ne its performance, and when it is discharged,
I trust 1 shall have placed my character as far be-
yond the darts which he has hurled at it, as my ar-
guments have proved to be above his abilities to
reply to them.    In doing this, I shall be compelled
Senate.
[ to speak of myself. No one can be more sensible
than I am how how odious it is to speak of oneis
self. I shall endeavor to confine myself within tire
limits of the strictest propriety, but if any thing
should escape me that may woand the most deli-
cate ear, the odium ought m justice to fall not on
me, but the Senator, who, by his unprovoked and
wanton attack, has imposed on me the painful ne-
cessity of speaking of myself.
The leading charge oí the Senator—that on which
all the others depend, and which, being overthrown,
they fall to the ground—is that I have gone oyer;
i have left his side, and joined the other. By this
vague and indefinite expression, I presume he
meant to imply that I bad either changed my opi-
nion, or abandoned my principle, or deserted my
party. If he did not mean one, or all, if I have
changed neither opinions, principles, nor party,
then the charge meant nothing deserving notice
But if he intended to imply, what I have presumed
he did, I take issue on the fact—I meet and repel
the charge. It happened, fortunately for me,
fortunately for the cause of truth and justice, that
it was not the first time that I had offered my senti-
ments on the question now under consideration.
There is scarcely a single point in the present issue
on which I did not exphctly express my opinion,
four years ago, m my place here, when the remo-
val of the deposites and the questions connected
with it were under discussion—so explicitly as to
repel effectually the charge of any change on my
part, and to make it impossible for me to pursue
any other course than I have without involving
myself in gross inconsistency. I intend not to
leave so important a point to rest on my bare asser-
tion What I assert stands on record, which I
now hold in my possession, and intend, at the pro-
per time, to introduce and read. But, before I do
that, it will be proper I should state the questions
now at issue, and mv course in relation to them, so
that, having a clear and distinct perception of
them, you may, Senators, readily and satisfac-
torily compare and determine whether my course
on the present occasion coincides with the opinions
I then expressed
There are three questions, as is agreed by all,
involved m the present issue •   Shall we separate
I the Government from the banks, or shall we re-
vive the league of State banks, or create a national
bank2 My opinion and course in reference to
each are well known. I prefer the separation to
either of the others, and, as between the other two,
I regard a national bank as a more efficient and
a less corrupting fiscal agent than a league of State
banks It is also well known that I have ex-
pressed my self on the present occasion hostile to
the banking system, as it exists, and against the
constitutional power of making a bank, unless on
the assumption that we hare the right to receive
and treat bank notes as casi in our fiscal opera-
tions, which I, for the first time, have denied on
the present occasion Now, I entertained and ex-
pressed all these opinions, on a different occasion,
, four years ago, except the right of receiving bank
notes, in regard to which I then reserved my opi-
nion ; and if all this should be fully and clearly
established by the record, from speeches delivered
and published at the time, the charge of the Sena-
tor must, in the opinion of all, however prejudiced,
sink to the ground I am now prepared to intro-
duce, and have the recoid read 1 delivered two
speeches m the session of 1833-34, one on the re-
moval of the deposites, ana the other on the ques-
tion of the renewal of the charter oí the late bank.
I ask the Secretary to turn to the volume i, ing
before him, and read the three paragraphs market
m my speech on the deposites I will thank him
to raise his voice, and read slowly, so that he may
be distinctly heard, and I must ask you, Senators,
togrveyour attentive hearing, for on the coinci-
dence between my opinions then and my course
now ray vindication against this unpiovoked and
groundless chaige rests.
