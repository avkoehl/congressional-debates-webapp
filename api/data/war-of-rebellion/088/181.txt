General FOSTER:

SIR: I have passed through the woods and marched a quarter of a mile beyond, and am trying to communicate with General Hancock; have not done so as yet. Enemy's main works are in sight. My men are nearly exhausted and I am resting them.

I am, sir,

G. B. DANDY,

[Inclosure Numbers 2.]

AUGUST 14, 1864.

General FOSTER:

SIR: I cannot find General Hancock. There is one of his regiments supporting a battery in an earth-work near the housed. We occasionally get a shot from the enemy's sharpshooters and are in sight of their works. I have crossed a road which I am told is the New Market road, but I do not know. Both myself and men are very much exhausted, but are getting rested. I shall throw a line of skirmishers out to feel the enemy's sharpshooters and in the direction to the right of this works.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

G. B. DANDY,

Colonel 100th New York Volunteers.

Major-General BUTLER:

When will Kautz's regiment at Fort Powhatan be back? His force is so small that it is difficult to cover our left and rear without this regiment, so he reports, and this duty, owing to Gregg's absence, is very important. Can you not order it back to report to Kautz?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
