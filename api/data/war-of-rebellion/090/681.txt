Your telegrams@ of yesterday has been received. The Government is taking all the measures within its power to protect your State from the rebel forces. Much might be done by the loyal people to impede any advance if it should be attempted by cutting down trees and blocking the roads and destroying bridges. If you would give attention to this subject and induce your people to do something themselves they could in the way suggested accomplish a good deal for their own protection and aid our forces in following and destroying the rebels.
