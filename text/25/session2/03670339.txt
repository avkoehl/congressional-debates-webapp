legislate with more certainty and effect with regard
to them. One of the objects oí the bill was to
elevate the Indian character, and to give them
respect for, and confidence m, themselves, and
the most effectual way of doing so would be to
give them the incentive of honorable office, and
the committee thought it important that such in-
centives should be held out to the ambitious and
enterprising ol this people, instead of the ambition
they now have to become warlike chiefs The
bill was, m his opinion, the most effectual measure
that could be devised for the security of the States
of Missouri and Arkansas, on the borders of which
such numbers of these Indians had been thrown,
and also the only feasible plan of saving these un-
fortunates from utter destruction They had been
crowded back by the white population until they
could go no further west, and now was the accepted
time tor the philanthrop st to step forward and
preserve them As the State of Missouri had been
alluded to, Mr L, readseveial passages from the
memorial of the Legislature oí Missouri on the
subject, in which 'he policy embraced in the bill
was strongly urged.
Mi LUMPKIN uiged the Senate to proceed at
once to the consideration of the measure, which he
looked upon to be the best that could be devised,
not only for the protection and security of the fron-
tier States of Missouri and Arkansas, but of the
Indians themselves, and as eminently calculated to
elevate and improve their condition. The objects
embraced in this bill, Mr L said, were not new —
The subject had been before Congress from the
days of General Washington to the present time,
and by a reference to the public documents u
would be seen that Mr Jefferson, and all of his suc-
cessors, had viewed it as worthy of the most favo-
rable consideration of Congress
In the course of his remarks, Mi L adverted
to the two able reports made on th subject by Mr
Monroe and by Mr Calhoun, and said that the
subject had been discussed until it would seem that
it was not only familiar to every irember of Con-
gress, but to the whole reading portion of the com-
munity. If this, he said, were not enough, the in-
formation presented during this session, and the
able speech of the honorable Senator from Indiana,
[Mr. Tipton,] so replete with information and de-
tail, would be sufficient to call the special attention
of every Senator to the subject. Mi L said he
would not now attempt to enter into an argument
•n defence of the bill, for he concurred with the
chairman of the Committee on Indian affairs that
this would be uanecessaiy, unless some more pHu-
sible objections should be urged against it ¡Inn hid
yet been heard Should it bi come nece sary, he
was confident that th friends < f the bllwoukl be
fully able to answer any objet ons th it might be
made to it, and he himself wou'd cbcciully con-
tribute h a mite

strance oí the Choctav/ and Creek de'cgationwbieh
he had presented As to the objections made by
tnese delegations, he was po.v sa> sued that they
had no foundation, and that they had no right to .n-
terfere, as no trice would become part oí tKis t on-
federacy witnout their express consent Mr C in
corroboration of this, quoted the tv o j revisions of
the lull applicable to the case Wit i vard to the
objection of the Senator from Michigan, [Mr Nor
VÜ.L.L,] he differed with him entire'}, an t he thought
that the section ought to be preserved both on ac
count of economy and oí good faith The pro-
vision objected to, was better than the present mode
of treating with the Indians, by which delegat ons
of the various tribes were frequently permitted to
come to the seat of Government at the expense of
the United States One of the inducements hell
out to the Southwest Indians when they agreed to
remove to the west of the Mississippi, was that thev
would be allowed to have a delegate at the seat of
Government. Sir. C was truly anxious to get nd
of the Indians that were ¡ft the old States.   They

their own way, by remaining where tl ey are Mr
C. said that he would not peisi^t m his motion for a
postponement, though he w ould rather have had
more time allowed him for consideration
Mr NORVELL here modified his amendment
by striking cut the provision m the eighth section
for a delegate of Indian uescent to reside at the
seat of Government during ihe sessions of Con-
gress, and to insert agent instead, and to strike out
the vvotds "with the «ame compensation as that of
a member of Congiess," and also to strike out the
preambl" to the section in the following words
'Sec 8 And to promote the advancement of
such confedeiated tribes m the science of civil go-
vernment, to afford them a convincing proof of the
desire of the United States that they may be se-
cured the enjoyment of the benefit oí fue govern-
ment, and to enable them at all times to represent
their condition to the Government "
The object of this amendment was to allow the
tribes an "agent," instead of a "delegate," as in
the bill, and to leave the compensation to be set-
tled hereafter He wished also to strike out the
preamble, because it contained prec sely the words
by which the attempt to establish a free negro re-
presentation in the United States might be urged
He was not opposed to the bill, Mr N said, but to
this section.
Mr ALLEN threw on* some objections to the
principles involved in the bill, w ih a view of eli-
citing inquiry, and an answer to them from some
gentlemen better acquainted with the subject, than
he professed to be Tms Government had always
acted towaids the Indians under the tieaty making
powei, heating them as communities, but now it
was proposed to act towards them m a kgis'ati e
capacity, tieitwg then asm livid lis He wished

These were the scruples which he enteitained, an 1
unless they could be removed, he must vote
against the bill

the Indian were natural enemies, that the bill pro-

posed an increase of the energies, and an organiza-
ron of the lorces, of our enemies, that the lands
upon which we had located these Indians might be

sir, the Senator had assumed th  brord ground
that the v bite man and the Indian are b} nature
enemies to each other
[Here Mr Allen rose ard said, that he had no
particular allusion to any vindictive or hostile feel-
ing existing personally between them ]
Mr S said he had no disposition to misundei-
stand ¿nv Senatoi, nor could h° believe that he had
mi.conceived the Senator from Ohio , for, sir, it is
not to be di gmsed that a large poition of the argu-
ment of that Senator was based upon a supposed
danger tint was to be apprehended from a concen-
tration of tho,e tubes on the borders of the fron-
tier States, and it was iepe?tedly slid that they
were our natural enemies, and on'v wanted con-
centration and oigamzation to bring down their
\engeance upon us
