Brigadier General A. AMES,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: General Ord wishes you to march your men through the ravine or valley a little to the left of his headquarters, and all the way to cover them, if possible, from the enemy. Relieve your division this morning from the trenches if you can do so with safety, and march them across the Appomattox as fast as you can do so. Please report as you start. Be careful to prevent straggling.

Respectfully,

S. S. SEWARD,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
