DUBLIN, May 8, 1864.

Major-General BRECKINRIDGE:

McCausland detained here by order of General Bragg. Cant' tell when he will leave, if at all. The enemy's five regiments infantry, ten pieces artillery, and two companies of cavalry, were on Walker's Creek road, six miles beyond Shannon's, at 10 a. m. No later news. Jenkins is in line of battle about Back Creek. Averell, with ten regiments of cavalry, threatened Saltville through Tazewell. We will give them a warn reception here. Deem it imprudent to mention our disposition, as I have no time to put my telegram in cipher. But, unless enemy display greater activity and skill, we will not be driven off. I remain here a few hours, but will see the fifth.
