Captain EDMUND P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, San Antonio:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that the prevailing unfavorable winds retarded the placing of the obstructions across the main channel to such exigent that to last night only three rafts have been anchored. When during the night of the 21st one of the fastened rafts was found blow up, after examination I came to the conclusion that tit wad one by one of the torpedoes placed by Colonel Forshey, and not anchored sufficiently well to prevent its drifting with the tide under the raft and exploding. If all the rafts had been fastened across the damage would have been almost immaterial. But as it is, it caused the chains of the different anchors to be entangled and some moved out of position, so that it doubles the original amount of labor of placing them, being obliged to disentangle, loosen, raise anchors, repair raft, and them commence placing them again. It will require probably fifteen working days to complete the work. The balance of the works are progressing as well as could possibly be expected from eh amount of labor and material at my disposition.

I have the honor to remain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

V. SULAKOWSKI,

Chief Engineer.
