Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr. Wise.

us, in the name of God let it go to the S ates, and
do some good, whatever it may
Bat, sir, though we are told these funds are una-
vailable, yet we are at the same time told tha' the
Government cannot get on w it out these lúa s
If the funds are unavailible, how n ill hey enable the
Government to get oni Now sir, I fieely confess
that I cannot comprehend this alleged deficit m the
Treasury I, like Other pumpkin hcahd gentle-
men on thi« floor, cannot un lerstind the ''icie'aiy's
report I figuied upon i s da a unul I threw dojm
my slate in despan B i', -=ii, I hive been stiuck
wifh this singular spectacle—such an one I venune
to say, has never been e\hibiel befoie, it is a
perfect commentaiy u¡ n the misrule which has
brought us to this scene ot miserv and distress We
see on one Sj.de tne opposition to a man striving to
demonstrate that the &ev eminent has fan 'sand can
pay it¡ debts And we seethe administration, on the
other side, those who were bound to see that the
Tieasuiy was not exhausted and the public credit
preserved, to a mo ?i, ft om the ixci clary down,-tinting
topiove tluct the 'Vteasuiy zn their hands, and undo
than ¿ole supei inte"dcnce, h « Hidden y, from an oier-
flovniig staU, become bankrupt" Sn, I call pnb'ic
attention to this utter profligacy I ask, I implore
the people to consider tins spectacle, to contrast it
with scenes which transpired before then eyes but
yesterday A moment ago we had a surplus—the
party boasted of our means—they claimed the
credit of an unexampled prosperity, to day, they
come in to take the benefit of the insolvent law—
they are ready to swear they have not, of all this
surplus, left one dollar to pay our honest creditors '
Such is their effrontery, the case speaks for itself,
and I would speak to them Sir, I would say to
them, you must quit Hading, you must give up the
concerns of Government, you have pioved your-
selves mcompe ent from knavery or folly " No
man should trade on borrowed capital " You have
brought the Governm ntto bankruptcy and borrow-
ing, you have three years to wind up your affairs,
we will give you that time in which to settle with
the People, and then we require you to give up
their Government to safer and honester hands Yes,
sir, let us call to mind the scene exhibited here m
March last, when the Greatest and Best was retir-
ing from office, and his successor was installed,
with his high approbation, under a solemn pledge
to carry out his hallowed policy, big with national
prosperity and grandeur—when the flow of milk
and honey was promised tj the land—when gold
was to glitter on our very streets—when the great
chief and the little jtmtr^l were drawn on the frag-
ments of the Constitution by lour white horses, as
the kings of old, the hoises almost pawing down
the crowd, and the crowd shouting hosannas to their |
great benefactors Sir, let us remember that scene
in the etet portico of the Capitol1 All was well'
The nation v. as prosperous and happy on the 4th
day of March, 1837' Sir, / was a miserably dis-
contented man, the old chief had told us the same
story m his last message , I joined issue with him,
I was gailty of sacrilege for dai mg to deny his state-
ments He said the Treasury Department had
been well conducted I drew Mr Woodbury and
Reuben, and the whole pack, before a committee
of inv estigalion, they all swore that all was right—
the deposite banks, the Treasury, the whole De-
partment, all, all was safe and sound Sir, look at
Mr Woodbury's examination and the report of the
committee last spring, as late as the third of March
last, the delusion was kept up to the very instant
of time, the 4th of Match the inauguiation day,
when the pet banks tumbled dow n one after anofher,
like so many bricks on their crd-- in a row
Trub truly, it may be said, sir, mat the evil
which General Jackson did Ives after him lie
was the most fortunate man that God ever peimit
ted to not in success rnd to triumph overmuch
ihat v asgooll Hen aired wi nout ceasing against
the Bank oí the Unued S ates, he rendered it an
odious monster, and kil'ed it in the confidence of
men, yet, all the time tnat he vas in power and
wielding that power against that institution, it was
fmctifvmg the nation, sustaining exchange, main-
taining credit, a sound currency, regulating, in a
measure, excessive bank xSsues, meting out to labor
its reward, insuring confidence m trad?, keeping
prices steady and advancing, pad m every way
warding of the evil dav until after Gencia' JaeV-
son's term of office ex}i red His, monster lived to
keep him an 1 his power and popu'arity a'ive, until
t was too late to rebuke him for the mischiefs we
now endure It gave us a seeming prosperity
which was all ascribed to Geneial Jackson, and
verily his enemy was made to praise him Su, it
was the most signal instance of goo 1 fortune in his
whole life, that the bank continued m existence un-
til within one year ol the expnation ot hisieign,
and that the effects ol its d«a h eo lid no be felt un-
til one year afcei the expiiaujn of its chatter, and
one day afici his polmeal carecí ceased' It was
wonderful m the concidence ol events No one
thought tha' disorder would so soon amve—it
waited not a moment after Jackson ceased to be
President You may look thiough his whole life,
I say, to the cock-pit, the hoise-race scenes, to his
hair breadth 'scapes in war, and to his glorious \ le-
tonas, and n 5t find a parallel instance of good luck
with this We were told that the bank would fall
like the oak in the forest, crashing every tendei
shrub in reach of its giant trunk and branches
Not so, it died like a good man, quietly, and al-
most in silent piayei The eaith shook not at its
fall, and v et, m one year from that event, the cied-
itot the Government and the ttade of the people
are crushed Sir, when it died, the artenal blood
dried up, its bills ot exchange, which it kept at the
lowest rate m market, were that blood—it circulat-
ed m the great ai tenes between the exporting and
importing points—between northeast and southwest,
New Yoik and New Oileans The bank was your
importing and exporting agent, theaitery of inter-
nal exchange was cut, and the nation now lies
bleeding to death1 None oí this happened, be
cause it could not, until aftei Jackson ceased to
reign Now, oh1 ye, the people, contrast the " last
annual message ot the Chief, and his farewell ad
dress," with the fir«t exliaordmary message ol his
successoi ' Sir, the Administration either knew ol
all these íesults which we have witnessed, so rum
ous and disastrous, or they did not They may
take which Horn ol the dilemma they choose V
they did not sec the operation ol causes and the
coming ol events almost touching their noses-
events which were predicted for years—events
which have lollowed so suddenly upon their boasts
of prospent}, upon times when the Administration
party was for votmgawaymillions for every species
of extravagance, upon times when, instead of with
holding appropriations, they were making the most
numerous and extensive Government contracts—
contracting away millions in a month—I will not
be harsh, I will not say il they did not know and
did not consider, they must have been lools, or, if
they s>aw and knew what was coming, they did not
wain the people, and they must be knaves A
friend the other day said he would put forth horns
upon them, and make the beast complete ' I will
not say tney must be both knaves and tools, but I do
say there has been most shameful, wilful, blind, and
gross mismanagement, and mal administration, and
if theie be no hope of reform, all hope of preserv-
ing the Government and its lieedom and puntv
must cease' Their great panacea, then deposite
bank system has signally, wofully failed, it was
recommended and defended but yesterday as the
best substitute lor the Bank of ihe United Slates,
it was to supplv exchange, and pel lot m ev cry finan-
cial and commercial function, a id we have seen,
ma day, m what it has resulted Fhey now re-
commend another sovereign remedí another king
cute all a sub treasury system Are they to be
confided in i Aie they and their plan not to be
distrusted i Are the people not si ck of experiments 1
But, sir, this part of the discussion I must reserve
for the time when the sub treasury system comes
up, though I do not believe it will ever be present-
ed, in good faith, to the decision and action of this
house
To return to the subject of this bill The chan-
man of the Committee of Ways and Means says
the qaestion is as to oar ab'hty to drpontt, not to
pay this fourth instalment The amoun1 ol the in-
stalment is unquestionably m the deposite banks
If this, as I ¡contend, be a d'posilc only with the
States it will not in the least dimmish th" funds m
your Treasury Sir, according to m, construction
of the deposite act of 1S36 von may ev ti v day give
thir'y days' notice, and call m the amounts allowed
under the act, upon giving such notice^ And, if
this be to deposite merely with the States, the ob-
lection to depositing the fourth instalment, urged
by the gentleman from Sou'h Carolina, (Mr Pick-
ens,) that if the fourth mstalrent siould not be
postpone 1 the bin dens of ta> paying people must
be increased, vanishes If a deposite meiel}, the
money still remains in the Treasury, and there will
H. of Reps.
bs. no necessity for raising levenue or increasing
taxes
But, if we will not postpone the fourth instal-
ment, we aie asked how we will relieve the Trea-
suiy, and tuimsh it with funds'* We leply, sus-
pend your enormous appropriations, stop your ex-
travagant expenditures We are answered, that
contiact, have aheady been made for most of the
appiopnations ¡an, I do njt believe the fact as-
sette I The Secretaiy has been called on fof a re-
port oí amounts contracted loi, he has not yet fur
nished the house with the infoimation Have the
departments all been striving to make contiaas as
fast as possible, and loan exient andanount un-
heard of, in Older to make out a deneiency in the
Tieasury ! Sir, I believe thev have, and this of it
sell is a serious instance of mismanagement Let
the informa ion come from the Secretary, andjoa
will find millions uncontracted for But, sir, be-
foie the inhumation comes, we will have acted on
this bill You rush y our bills ihiough the commit-
tees, and in the '■■ouse you will not wait a moment
to ob ain the light necessary foi us to vote undei-
siandtngl} I now see my friend over the wav
(Mi C'ushman) ready to move the previous ques
tion, when I am done, he will pop up like the
striker in a piano foite
[Mr Cushman here interposed J
Mr Wise Sir, I did not know the gentleman
had resigned his office I mean to < omplam that
just as we get a bill through, generally, the propei
information comes m and is punted and we are
left aftei wards to wondei how «o many mistakes
and so much mischiei could have happened' This
information now wanting is most important Who
can answer how much oí your enormous expendi-
tures are contracted for"!
Sir, my li lend from Tennessee has been asked
why he does not bring in a billto icpcal appropin
lions'! We answer that theie is no necessity foi
such a bill Sn, if you withhold means loi all th s
extravagance, some ot the appiopnaaous must be
expended by the Executive The Secretary him
sell tells us that he has taken the responsibility ol
suspending fifteen millions Why cannot he sus
pend more 1 Does the gentleman from South -Caro-
lina (Mr Pickens) desire the responsibility to be
taken off the shouldeis of the Executive, and does
he wish to see a scramble m tins house between the
different delegations who have iavonte objects of
expenditure, as to which shall be suspended1 Does
he desire to set us by the ears, to determine whether
the reduction shall be made on harbois of New
Yoik or Ohio, or whether it shall be made on such
objects as the exploring expedition "> By the by, I
would ask the gentleman Irom Ohio, (Mr Hamer)
what has be< ome of that beautiful project i I would
inquire of that good old bachelor, the Secretary ol
the Navy who studies botany, I am told, how many
vessels Captain Jones has at Norfolk, how long
have they been there, in what state of pi eparatiori
are they for sailing to the south pole, how muehil
will take jet to fit them for sea1 Some half of a
million perhaps has been expended, and Captain
Jones has not been enabled by the Department, I
believe, to sail fuither than from the Norfolk navy
y aid to Himpton roads* and back I wonder if hf
met anv ol the South Sea Islanders' But the gen
tleman from North Caí olma (Ml McKay)tellsu
that all the ordinary appropriations are as small as
tho.se un lei the condemned Administration of the
ostiacised gentleman fiom Massachusetts (Mr
Adams ) He says the enoimous appropriations an
all 'ec'ranrdmr/ri/'" And, sir, verily they are
It is oí tueir being extraordinary that ve complain
Sir, the gentleman shall not escape in that way
Are ert to ordinal y appropriations to be toleralei
simply b'cause thev arc eittaordwaiy7 I slwtik
think, sir, that would be the best reason for suspend
mg them And,m these very extraordinary times
I should think Mr Secretan woald be very justifi
able in suspending some of them H"should-kno\
the mosipioper objects of expenditure, andhesjiouh
I novv best where the reduction ohould be made
wnl insure it, sir, that he finds out x ery certainly
if left to himself, how 'oget along without this pos
ponement of nine millions to the States and wit?
out giving him, m addition, ten million  of Tic

But the gentleman from South Caiolma h
rather tu ned upon his old party associates m th
opposition, and complains if a biH t i suspend a¡
