President DAVIS:

I thank you for your kindness. The Arkansas was to have been out this mornign; have not heard yet why she has not made her appearance- look for her every moment. She has much to contend with here, but it was deemed better to let her try her strength than to get aground in the Yazoo and be burnt up like the rest. Pinckeny should be tried by court- martial. Arkansas ordered to run the gauntlet, andm, if successful, to seweep the reiver below and run to Mobkile as soon as out. I will inform you of rexssult. Canal not yet in running order.*

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

President DAVIS:

All the vessels of war of the lower fleet, except sloop- of- war, and all trasports, have gotten up steam and are off to get out of way of Arkansas. One mortar- baoat, disabled and aground, is now burning up.

VICKSBURG, July 15, 1862.

To the PRESIDENT:

Arkansas, under cover our batteries, ran gloriaously through twelve or thirteen rams, gun- baots, and sloops- of- war. Ten men killed and less wounded. Captain Brown, her commander and hereo, was slightly wounded in the head. Smoke- stack riddled; otherwise not materially damaged. Soon be repaired and then, Ho! for New Orleans. Two of the enemy's baots ran into shore to keep from sinking- struck colors- many killed and wounded. Glorioius for the navy, and glorius for her heroic commander, officers, and men. They deserve your tanks.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.

President DAVIS:

Enemy opened all their guns and mortars last evening and shelled the city and batteries until after dark, when eight of their vessls of war passed down under fire of batteries and Arkansas' baraodsides. What damage was done to them have not larned, though they were repeatedly pierced by shot of heviest caliber. One heavy shot passed through side of Arkansas, killing 2 men and wounding 3. This was all the damage done to us, with exception of one house burned down in city. Our troops have cotnempt for fleet and bombardment and await coolly for troops to land. The Arkansas is the admitration of all, and her daring and heroic act has inspirex all with the greatest enthusiasm. She is now being repaired and will soon be ready for orders.

EARL VAN DORN,

Major-General.
