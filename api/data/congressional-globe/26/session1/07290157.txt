at the very foundation. He did not wish to be
understood as making any allusion to either of the
parties in the present case; for although but one of
thíse pames had, to the best of his recollection,
made allegations of illegal votes, yet in this, as in
mo^t other cases of highly excited election, it is
not improbable that illegal votes have been re-
ceived for both.
He coQld enumerate many evils attendant
on the investigation of the ballot box, espe-
cially when the ballot is by secret voting;
but all these objections sink into insignificance,
when compared with the high and permanent im-
portance of preserving our elections pure.
He would here merely allude to a circumstance
that had taken place previous to the reference of
this case, as ind cative of the sense of the House
at that time, as to what should be the course of the
commitiee.   To the resolution proposing the re-
ference, there was an amendment offered, instruct
ing the committee, in substance, to make a repor
as to who should occupy seats until the election
was decided on its merits.   The mover of the reso-
lution distinctly refused to accept the amendment
a* a modincat on.   The House diJ not adopt it,
and the resolution passed in comprehensive terms,
instructing the committee to inquire and report
who were "entitled to occupy, as members of this
House, the five contested s>eats."
Observing by the c'ock that the time had almost
expired, allowed by the rales for the consideration
of reports from committees, he would not detain
the Home longer ihan to exprets his thanks for
the attention with which he had been heard, and to
express his conviction ihat they whose claims are
founded in justice, have but little to apprsbend
frjin a thorough investigation into thib subject, but
will ultimately Uke their seats in this hall the un-
challenged Representatives of the freemen of their
State.
SPEECH OF MR. DAVIS, /
OF MASSACHUSETTS                I
In ¡Senate, January 23, 1810—The Independent Treasur
being under consideration, and the Senate having c-4i'
determination not to adjourn without taking the
upon the final passage of the bill—
Mr DAVIS said  Irise, Mr President, with great reluctance
at this late hour to address the Senate, (aligned as it is with an
unusillj lung session, and exhausted by the dubate, but, painlul
a¡> it is, I mustciHi eat then indulgence while I make a brief re
ply to the new doctnneb which have been nuw, lor the first
tune, published litre, and come to us through channels that
Itave fi i doubt of their being the doctrines ot the Administra
lion    rhey involve and have drawu into this debate great and
momen.ous considerations, affecting the mot cherished nilc
rests eftUe people I representas well as of nearly the whole
cjuntry    With  the   exception oi a few  incidental remarks
mide by me a day or two a¿o, no oie fiom the North ami East
lias addressed you during tins discussion, and as sume part ol

P'rei nally, as il the positions assumed wete incapable  f refu
ation, I feel urged by an n resistible sense of duty—nay, I  can
n Jt reconcile uiysell to forbear from making some reply
The Senator I rom Mississippi, [Mr Walker,] with his usual
acknowledged ability, and the distinguished Senator I rom Penu
sylvauia, [Jlr Buchanan,] following in his track, have ad
vanead the propositions that the embarrassments and distress
with which the country lias been grievously afflicted for several
\tare pa^t, and wlueh now paialyz all iu energies, are impu
table to the pernicious influence ol bank paper, that this bill
contains the necessary eortec ive, as it will cheek im/ oi tations
of foreign goods, suppre=.¡* what they call the creditsyjtem, and,
by restoring a specie curreuey, leduce the wages ot (he labor
er, once the value ol pioperty
lilisis the character inven to the measure by its frieud^, and,
alarming as the doctunes are, I am gratified that they are
frankly avowed I have been anneipated, to a considerable e\
teut, by the Senator fiom Mississippi, [Mi Hindbrsjn ] In
'•vh.at I have to sav, I shall, however, confine niysell chiefly to
t ie speech of the senator Irom Pennsylvania, who has gone
more m detail into the subject, lor we all acknowledge his
ability on this floor, and his capacity to do ample justice to the
subjects w hich he discusses
I do not propose to follow him through a very large portion
ofmselabo ate argument to prove that Executive powei has
of late been shutmed, instead of being sought after, or that the
present and the old Bank ol the United States are identical, and
horn National Banks Enough has been «aid on these points
He lias, however, asserted that we have abandoned all the ai
guments which we have before used against the Sub Treasury,
because the progress of events has ptoved them, unsound Not
•o, far from it With others, I entered into that debate, which
is before the public, and the arguments umrefuted stand as firm
a  ever, but it would be a profitless task to reiterate them
here, and this is the reason why they aie passed over in the
dlscussio i
But,iir, I win not dwell upon any of these matters, but go to
that in hand lue Senator «ay* we labor under distressing em
barrassoieuts, and so w e do, no one will have the hardihood to
deny it, foi all the country in sorrow bears testimony to it We
have, It is true, seen an occasional gleam of light, but it has
toen soon olmi-ured, ami we have been shrou led in a gloomy
uncertainty He says, further, that the cause «excessive issues
of bank paper, «peculation, md a bloated (I use his words) ere
dit system He lodges the guilt on the shoulders of the banks
alone It is neither j nst nor fair to hold them alone responsible,
and I will make it manifest by showing that they were seduced
into their errors by the Administration
Before the late President (Jackson) seized the public money
and took it into his own custody, in 1833, there was no com
plaint about the currency, all the people know this, for all, even
the President himself in one ot his messages, united in declar
lug, in substance, it was sound, and equal to that ot any nation
on earth There was no complaint, no inconvenience, no em-
barrassment, from this source, in doing business but content
ment and satisfaction every wheie About this theie could be
no mistake, nor will any one heie attempt to íefute the well
known facts
But fiom that act of the President, which was the first move-
ment to relorm the currency, to this day, there has been what
the Senator is pleased to call "expansion, contraction, and ex-
plosio i," in rapid and feartul succession, cusís upon ciuis,
pressu e upon pressure, panic upon panic, have succeeded,
till we have reached a state of suspicion and alarm that has de
ranged and almost suspehded business The storm in its fuiy
has swept over the country, once and asain uprooting the
stateliest and firmest trees, and leaving in its tra k a dreary,
desálate waste Its marks are too deeply engraven, too dis
tinct, too well defined to leave any thing uncertain—any thing
equivocal Itfelluponus with such withering energy as to
leave no doubt when, where, and how it began
Gentlemen may tax their ingenuity, they may task their in
ventions, to discover other causes of distress—they may belabor
an 1 hold up to scorn and execration the banks as long as they
pleise—they cannot change the facts, for they cannot obliterate
liis'ory Things were well, and every body knows it, till 1833
'I hen began the bank reform by the removal of the deposites—
and then began the rapid series of "expansion, contraction,
and explosion"—then followed crisis after crisis—then came
thedenngementof exchanges, and then the embarrassments
which have overwhelmed the country—then came, too, the
nine Mmci  ed banks of which the Senator speaks, though he
has probably swelled the number beyond historical truth
The Senator admits, what cannot be denied, that the Admi
msnation proposed and earned into effect the State bank depo
site system It was in this place and by them that State banks
were taken into favor, petted, and boastmgly held out to the
country a  affording a better and saler currency Into them
was the revenue put in enotmous sums, and they were directed
to • in fieely upon it by the President for the accommodation
of the people, and it was lus pride and pleasure to make known
to us t mt the public money was thus emplo} ed instead of being
locked up, a sulking commentary upon the piesent plan ol
vaults and sales, Mr President
The Senator admits that this was the policy of the A minis
tration, and that the disastrous consequences predicted by the
Opposition have been venfied    lie might have gone fuithei,
(or it is truth equally undeniable, tint this policy sowed the
seed of nearty or quite one halt ot the whole number ol banks
—between eight and nine hundred—and ol more than one
half of the capital, that it was the parent of the paper "ex
pansion, contraction, and explosion," of which he has spo
ken in terms ol just seventy  that it is alike the paient of the
bloated credit system whuh he affirms has made us all gam
biers  and that the mad speculation which raged ovci thecoun
try, and has furnished the theme for declamation and denuncia
tio.i in these halls (or three yeais past, was begotten by it
Such arc the facts, and on the projectors of this policy let the
responsibility re=t    We had had no ' expansions, contractions,
or explosions," lor a long period, that did not fanly belong to
the vibrations ot trade, none that excited alarm, or seriously
disturbed public confidence, till we came to this retorming poll
ry, but since then the public mind has scarcely been tranquil
In d.   In  1831 came the first fell swoop, which overtuined
and bankrupted thousands, and it originated here    In 35 -b
came the gieat era ol bank making and trading upon the
public money, then accumulated to sixty or seventy millions,
as nearly ai I remember, which threw the country into a fever
ish excitement, and even fiim, well balanced minds out of their
adjustment    There was arage for fortune-making and fortune
hunting such as had never been witnessed, and which nothing
but this pelio was capable of generating    The Senator might
and ought to have limited the bloated credit system that made
us all, as he affirms, gamb'ers, to this period, and left the
offspring to stand beside its parent as a proot of the disasters
ol this policv, and of the fulfilment of the predictions ol the
OpiHjsition, for go together they must, and live together thej
will m history  and no sephulry, no ingenuity can ever sepa
ratethcui     While the Senator admit' tins pohc) to heleng ex
cluaively to the Administrado >, and to have been strenuously
opposed by U3, and Us melancholy consequences predicted, he
now repudiates! it a's erroneous, and we must allow to him and
Insiriendo whatevei credit b longs to an abandonment of it
after it had literallv exploded, and the mischief is as accom
pllshed    But, «sii, he and they must be reminded that I could,
if I would, read from the messages of the President, and from
thesuccessive reports of the Secretary of ihe Tieasuiy, lan-
guage of exuItation, triumphing in the entire success of the
policy, boasting that the currency was on a better footing than
ever, that the exchanges weie greatly improved, and that, too,
at the very moment when the bloated credit was most ex
panded, and speculation was the mostufe and rank   Such was
the delusion that the madness which had seized m ultitudes wag
trumpeted  forth  as  evidence of success  and general pros-
perity    The Senator clearly reasons from false premises when
he makes the banks the origin of our embarrassments, for
they were onlv instruments in the hands of those who pro
jected the  measures that have  made  them what they are
But the Senator goes furthei, and tiaces the evils of banks
an 1 bank paper into England, and alleges, without qualification,
that from this cause business there is as badly paralyzed as it
is here, and I am not about to make an issue upon that point,
for I must hurry on to ot*ier mattei a    He makes an inference,
however, w iich I must notice    He says that tothiscircum
etam« alone we owe our ability to manufacture goods    If
England was a hard money country, our mills and hammers
would all be silent, but the paper system so raises the price
of wages, and, consequently, the puce ol production, that she
cannot send forth her goods so cheap as she otherwise could,
or so cheap as they are made in haid money country where
wage* are lower    And do we owe our success to this folly 1
Do we stand on such a slippery basis, having no foothold but
upon an error of policy, stupidly persisted in1   I desire to be
informed how iho hard money countries, as they are called—
Italy, Spain, Holland, France, and Germany—lor they have all
been put into that class, though not With strict historical accura-
cy—stand the.corhpetition of England, With her bloated creditsi
Yes, how, sir, do they figure iu the competitioni Who has
supplied our markets and the markets of the world? If me-
tallic cuirenry makes production cheaper—if it gives vantage
ground to a country in the general round of trade, how is it
that these nations have not long since run England out of oui
market with then cheaper goods! How is it that we draw an-
nually from England twofold more of imports than from all
the residue of Europe! Why is it that they, especially France,
shut their ports against most kind3 of English goods, to pro
teet their own manufactures? Why is the same policy pur
sued elsewhere! In these countries the hard money scheme
has had a long, full, and faithful trial, and we know the re-
sult England, without any advantages ovei them in our ports,
has overwhelmed them with her competition , and so it is
wherever trade is open to her upon a footing of equality with
them
Is it not, Mi President, i surpiismg fact that, the Senators
who have spoken upon this subject have selected the two
most tree, most commeicial nations—nations which, by their
e\traoidmary enterprise and then unsurpassed knowledge of
business, have carried then trade to the remotest parts of the
earth, and excelled all others in the accumulation of wealth,
and the enjoyments it bungs with it—nations highly civi
lize 1, and standing among the most enlightened in the globe —
as the examples ol unwise, imprudent, and vicious govern-
ent—so destitute of the first pnnciples of political economy
t waste the pioducts of their laboi through the unseen and
ncomprehensible influence of bank paper?
There is no denying that they have outrun all others in
prosperity while in the use of this paper and yet, accoiding to
the theory of the Senator, they have all the time labored un-
der a most oppressive policy, bloating wages and property,
while it has been the happy lot of other countries to live uu
der the auspicious influence of haid money Spain, Italy,
France, Holland, Germany, on the other hand, have become
pattern nations, distinguished for their wisdom, and also for
the happy condition of their laborers, who, doubtless, failing
to realize their condition, escape, whenever they can, to this
country or some other part of this continent
But, sir, I must leave tins topic and go to another The
Senatoi assures us that tins paper brings with it this alarm-
ing attribute—as it expands and contracts,  o property and
wages rre and fall, thus making it the vital principle of the
body politic, giving to it pulsation In speaking of paper, I
once and for all, wish always to be understood as meaning the
pa| ei ol sound specie paying banks, redeemable at sight, un-
less 1 otherwise specify Is this a sound axiom of the Sena
t >r? Is bank r aper the sole or chief regulator of the value of
nasres and property" If so, whenever theie is a common cur-
rency there should be a uniform price Let us see how the
position is sustained in the United States, where, in all parte
of the country, we have binks Ihe Senator from Missis-
sippi [Mi Hfnderson] stated that the services of an ordi-
nary laborer, which would cost fifteen dollars in his part of the
country, he had ascertained could bo had at Pittsburg for a
quaiter, or less, ol that sum, and in New England, as I uu-
deietood him, lor about half Eveiy body knows the vast dif-
ference in the expense of living between Boston and New
Orleans, and between New York and any remote country town
But how is it with haid money countries'! Expenses of all
sorts are unquestionably fourfold greater in Havana than in
Floience, audi might ?o on multiplying examples, for it is
much more difficult to find two places that correspond than
two that are at vauance Does it not not follow that currency,
while it undoubtedly has an influence, is not even the pnncij al
cau<¡eot this diveisity5
Hut, sir, I cannot dwell on this The Senator contended, by
an ingenious aigument, that a reduction of wages would be be-
neficial to the laborer, because property would necessarily
fall in the saint ratio, and, m thelervor of debate, addressing
N ew England through me, he appeals to her to embrace this ai
ternatvve as a resource to rescue her manufactures tram the ruin
which lays in prospect Embrace what, Mr Mr Presideut/
How will a conesponding fall of wages and propelty aid the
laborei! How is his condition to be unproved by ití The
* most that can be said is, that his relative condition is unchanged
But can he embrace the degraded condition of by fer tire larger
class of laborers in England and Ireland, where the alms-houses
are filled with paupers, and those who support themselves
struggle for life? Can lie descend a grade low er, to hard mo
nev Ttaly, where, as the authority read by the Senator from
Maryland [Mr Merrick) will prove, but I will not stop to read
it, w ages are three pence a day? Is ft an invitation to abandon
the physical, moral, and intellectual comforts and enjoyments
which sunound the industrious man here, and descend to the
deplorable coudition of those who fly from their country to
this a  a place ot reluge for the poor, the naked, and the
hungry?
But, sir, as 1 have more to say of this in a more appropriate
connection, I shall pass it foi the piesent, with a sinjtetre-
mark—it such are the advantages of other countries, way
do 'he pooi emigrate hnher, and why do not ourcitutens emi-
grate thithci'
I will new notice the effects upon the public policy which
ai e imputed to this bill We have always been told that it was
a simple proposition to divorce the Government from the
banks so as to enable it to hold its own money, and, therefore,
harmless in its character, as it would affect nothing else.
But, sir, the Senator from Pennsylvania, while he declares
that he is not for an exclusive haid money currency, or, in
other words, is not hostile to well regulated State banks, if
they can be well legulated, as he expresses himself, argues
that this bill will dimmish importations, suppress credit, arid
stop speculation, by modifying the currency so far as to work
out these extraoidinary ends
I am by no means satisfied that it is capable of producing «il
these consequences, but, as such a power is imputed to njaj
its waimest friends, and those who are in the councils and confi-
dence of the Adminlsttation. who bring it forward, sal no
