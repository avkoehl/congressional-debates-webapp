orders. I know nothing of whereabouts of Indians, but believe they have gone to head of Yellowstone to meet Crows and Blackfeet for general war in the spring.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, March 3, 1865.

Brigadier General J. H. CAMERON,

Commanding Department of New Mexico, Santa Fe, N. Mex.:

GENERAL; I am in receipt of your communication of January 24, 1865, addressed to Major General S. R. Curtis. I am pushing troops out and shall occupy Forts Atkinson, Larned, Zarah, and other points on Lower Arkansas route, and as soon as they move I shall have 800 to 1,000 cavalry ready to move against the Indians in that country, wherever they may be. The posts from Riley to Fort Lyon will be sufficient and strong enough to protect the route and give proper escorts. I inclose orders* prescribing the manner emigrant trains must travel over the plains. If you will designate some point for trains going east to organize I think we can control the route. I am in favor of building the telegraph, but very much doubt whether the War Department will order it. I will cheerfully co-operate with you to the extent of my means, and with the posts you propose to occupy I have no doubt we will be able to hold the route open. The Indians of the plains have been operating extensively on the North Platte route and have now gone north toward the Black Hills, for the purpose, it is said, to form a junction with the Crows and Blackfeet for a general war. I shall be glad to hear from you at any time.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
