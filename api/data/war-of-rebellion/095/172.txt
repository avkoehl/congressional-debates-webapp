These figures are too simple and convincing to require remark, other than to explain that every possible care has been taken to secure accuracy. They are taken from the daily reports of the batteries, where men are specially detailed, under the close supervision of the battery commander, to note the effect of very shot. If any uncertainly exists the shot is entered "uncertain," and is not included in the final ration. I believe that such records have never before been attempted in actual service, and therefore regard them as extremely valuable.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Captain of Engineers, U. S. Army, Bvt. Brigadier General of Viols., Commanding

Brigadier General RICHARD DELAFIELD,

Chief Engineer, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS SIEGE ARTILLERY,Broadway Landing, Va., April 25, 1865.

GENERAL: In accordance with the requirements of the circular of July 29, 1864, I have the honor to submit the following report for March, 1865:

The following u, K&lt;] i in my command: On March 10 the three companies of the First Connecticut Artillery returned from Fort Fisher, N. C. On March 21 Major-General Hartsuff, commanding Defenses of Bermuda Hundred, announced me as commander of the artillery brigade of his command. This added a light battery to my forces, and thus placed me in command of eighteen companies; aggregate, 2,700 men and 199 guns. Of these, eight companies were serving with the Army of the Potomac, and ten with the Army of the James. On March 28 Brevet Major-General Hunt ordered me to report temporarily for the former to Major-General Parke, commanding Ninth Corps. During the month I was detailed by Major-General Meade as a member of a board to examine certain officer of the Fifteenth New York Volunteer Engineers, and by Lieutenant-General Grant as a member of two boards, one to report upon Colonel Tal. P. Schaffner's system of artillery mining, and the other upon Mr. R. L. Fleming's incendiary shell. These boards all completed the work assigned them and adjourned.

The following exhibits the firing of my batteries during March: Coehorn mortar, 1,107 rounds; 8-inch mortar, 461 rounds; 10-inch mortar,
