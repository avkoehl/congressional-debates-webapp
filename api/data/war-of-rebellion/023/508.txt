Governor Robinson reports that you are intending to remove the troops at Louisville to cincinnati, and he and others protest against it. If possible do not abandon Louisville, for with it we lose Kentucky. I have no desire to interfere with your details, but we ought not to lose Louisville. Please answer where your troops are and what you intend to do.

CINCINNATI, OHIO, September 11, 1862-11 p. m.

General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

I had no intention of abandoning Louisville or leaving it without strong protection. Cincinnati is seriously threatened,while the former is not. Two regiments only have been withdrawn from Louisville, Leaving there-three regiments of infantry, two of cavalry,and three complete and two incomplete batteries, to which should be added four or five more regiments and ten guns ordered in from Lebanon. It may be necessary to draw still further upon this force, but Louisville will be made safe.
