COLD HARBOR, June 7, 1864. (Received 10.50 a.m. 8th.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

All has been very quiet to-day. No casualties reported. My telegrams would be more frequent but for the fact that Mr. Dana keeps you fully advised. Permit me to renew my recommendation of T. S. Bowers for the position of assistant adjutant-general in the regular army to fill the vacancy created by Colonel Buell, placing Bowers at the foot of the list of majors.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS OF THE ARMY,Washington, June 7, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

In the Field:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 5th, by Lieutenant-Colonel Babcock, was received last evening. General Meigs has been advised of your wishes in regard to ferry-boats. He will keep all he has or can procure in the vicinity of Fort Monroe subject to your orders. Many of the side-wheel boats in the quartermaster's department will also answer all the purposes of ferry-boats. The barges will also be excellent for teams and stores, and can be towed by the tugs. Everything will be sent forward as soon as you direct. They are now mostly engaged as transports to White House. Nothing has recently been heard of Generals Hunter and Crook. Sherman is still doing well, but some apprehension has been left about Forrest's movements to cut off his communications. General Canby has sent forces to Memphis to assist in driving Forrest out of the country. Nothing recently from Steele. I inclose a list of the troops forwarded from this department to the Army of the Potomac since the campaign opened-48,265 men. I shall send you a few regiments more, when all resources will be exhausted till another draft is made.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
