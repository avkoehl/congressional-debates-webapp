Since writing the above I have received telegram from Major French as follows: "I am informed this morning by Bee &amp; Co. that they cannot send out orders for commissary supplies and that we cannot rely on them for importations; their funds are exhausted. This cancels the last contract. "

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK G. RUFFIN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.

SECRETARY OF TREASURY:

The perusal of this copy of an official letter in regard to the want of funds to supply the Army with the meat ration leads to refer it to you for attention. Colonel Wood will deliver it and may furnish you other facts.

The PRESIDENT:

When Colonel Ruffin applied for sterling the account of the Treasury Department with the depositaries in England was overdrawn 120,000 pounds. This was fully explained to Captain Strother, who applied for the 27,500 pounds, and if it was not made known to Colonel Ruffin also it should have been.

Had all of Colonel Ruffin's requirements been complied with, however, it would have contributed nothing to the relief of the Commissary Department, it being ascertained that the parties who offered to contract for the delivery of meat have so supplies in the islands. And if the supplies are to be procured from the British North American Provinces and from England, this can be accomplished as speedily and more economically by the Government.

I am informed by the Secretary of War that the Commissary Department will send out a special agent, and arrangements have been made to place at his disposal 100,000 pounds to be used partly in the British North American Provinces and partly in England to procure supplies. An order for 20,000 pounds has also been sent to Messrs. Crenshaw & Co., in Liverpool, to apply that amount from the proceeds of cotton to the purchase of commissary stores.
