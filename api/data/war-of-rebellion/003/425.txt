Can send five regiments, if leave is granted by the Department, as I am ordered to send them East as fast as ready. They are mostly river-men, and are well adapted to your expedition. They have been promised rifles by the Department, which have not arrived as yet. What kind of guns will you give them, and where are they at? Will telegraph the Department.

The governor of Indiana, in answer to my urgent request for troops, informed me by telegraph that he has five regiments ready, chiefly made up of river boatmen, but they are under orders for the East. He will ask for them to be kept on Western duty. They cannot be more urgently needed at any place than here, and I ask for them as immediately as the order can be given. Answer by telegraph.
