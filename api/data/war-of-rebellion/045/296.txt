SPRINGFIELD, ILL, June 24, 1863.

(Received 3 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Please answer whether you desire me to raise six-months'

troops, as I desire not to leave home for awhile. I think Illinois could furnish 10, 000.

RICH'D YATES,

Governor.

Harrisburg, June 24, 1863-4 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Washington:

I am of the opinion that not less than 10, 000 rebels-infantry, cavalry, and artillery-are between Shippensburg and Greencastle.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

BLOODY RUN, June 24, 1863.

Major-General COUCH:

McConnellsburg is in possession of the enemy. I think General Milroy had better [move] toward Mount Union, to cover that bridge, and be near you if you want his troops at Harrisburg.

WM. F. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.

Harrisburg, June 24, 1863.

General MILROY, Bloody Run:

Send 400 to 500 old infantry on horse, if possible, to hold the gaps near McConnellsburg and the one toward Hancock. Push this matter right trough without delay. Use horses to move rapidly. The troops there are not reliable.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.
