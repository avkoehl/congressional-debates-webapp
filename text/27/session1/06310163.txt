Fiscal Bank—Mr. Buchanan.
Sfnate.
of judges and consti utional lawyers, but if, after
all, thi-v failed to convince me that the law was
constitutional, I should be guilty of perjury before
high Heaven if I voted in its favor
I respect judicial dec sons, within their ap-
propriate sphere, as much as any Senator on
this floor They put at r st forever the con
troversy immediately before the court, and as a
general rule, they govern all future cases of the
same character, but even these decision , like all
other human things, are modified and changed by
the experience of time, and the lights of know
ledge The law is not now what it was fifty years
ago, nor what it will be fifty years hereafter.
But how does the constitutional question stand
at the present moment, even upon the authonty of
judicial precedent? Have the Supreme Court de-
cided that any independent p< wer exists in the
Constitution authorizing Congress to establish a
National Bank? No, sir, no such thing, because
this would have been in direct opposition to the
well known vo'e of the Convention itself, refu«mg
to Congress the power of granting charters nf in-
corporation There is no judicial precedent in
existence which can restrain or ever intended
to restrain the freedom of members of Con-
gress, in voting on ihe question ot a new
bank. Directly the rever e is the truth The
opinion of the Supreme Court, in the case 0f
M'Callough against the State of Maryland, decides
nosuch principle On thecontrary,it expresslj refers
the constitutional question back to Congress upon ev-
ery new attempt to pas  a new bank charter This de-
cision is founded upon two clause? ot the Constitu
tion, the one conferring on Congress the power 'to
lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excisi&"
for ihe purpose of paying me debts and providing
for the common defence and general welfare of the
United States, and the other, "to mak  all laws
which shall be nece sary and pirper for carrying
into execution" the enumerated power* The t nly
point decided is, that aftcr Congress have c'eter-
mmed that the establishment < f a bantt is a m ans
necessary and pioper for the collecttrn and dis
bursement of the public revenue, the Supreme
Court will not rejudge their justice and declare
that Un not a nec°s ary agent to accomplish these
purposes. They say that it must be an extreme
case indeed wh ch wouH induce them to ¡declare
that the means selected by Congress to carry into
effect any express power, were rot necessary and
proper to accomplish the purpose Th°y thus ex-
pressly rerer the question back to each Senator and
Representative called to act upon the subject, and
cast upon hiai the responsioiliiy of deciding whe-
ther a bank <f the United Sates be necessary to
carry into effect the power of taxation This is
the very point of ih dec si n But strange as it
may seem, whilst the Supreme Court have thus ex-
pressly devolved up n Congress ihe decision in thf
first instance of thequesion, whether a bank be
constitutional or not, keen seen ed gentlemen rise
m their places heie and gravely contend that this
very question has been so conclusively settled b
the Court as to fetter our judgments an4 conscien
ces, and compel us to abandon the we ot our rea-
son when legislating upon the subject So long
as the late bank was in exis ence, th  judgment of
the Court 1 clarmg it to be conitituiional, was the
law of the land in relation to hat institution But
it has passed away, an i now when it is pioposed to
estábil h a new bank, it becomes the imperative
duty of one and all of us, even in the opinion of ihe
Court, to decide (or himself whether this is a ne-
cessary agent to carry into etfect tie tax n<  power
For my own part, I do not think it is I believe
that the Independent Trea ury is an infinitely bet-
t-r agent for the purpose < f ct liec'mg and disburs-
ing the public revenue I shoul 1 g'e'Uly prefer, to
a United Sti'es Bank, even a system of special de
posi'es of the public money m Sta'e banks, prohi
biting them under severe penalties from using it
for basking purposes, although in c mpanson with
the Independent Treasury, I should disapprove
and condemn such a plan But any agent for me,
rather than a National Bank. The Judiciary,
then, most clearly have not settled this question
But even if the Judiciary had set'led the ques-
tion, I should never hold myself bound, by their
decision, whilst acting m a legislative character
Unlike the Senator fr m Ma-sachusetts [Mr
Bates] I shall never consent to place Ihe political
rishls and lib rti s of this people in the hands of
any judicial tribunal It was, tnere'ore, wit i the
utmost astonishment I heard the Sena or declare,
that he considered the expositions of the Constitution
by the judiciary to be equally binding upon us,asthe
expositionsot ihe moral law by iheSaviour of man-
kind, contained in the Gospel were upon Christians,
and that these judicial f xpesitions were of equa1 a 1-
thony with the text of th  Constitution This, sir is
an infallibility which was never before claimed for
any human tribunal, an mfallibihtj which would
convert freemen into abject slaves, an infallibility
which would havp rendered the infamous sedition
law as sacred as ihe Oc nstitution Use f the judicial
having decided this Jaw to b" c nstituti na\ end
wh ch would thus have annihilated throughout
the whole extent of thi  U ion, the liberty of the
press and the freedom of speecn No, sir, ro it
is not 'he genius of cur institutions to consider
mortal men as infalible
No man hole's in h gher estimation than I do, the
memory of Cuef Justice Marshall, but I should
never have consented to make eien him the final
arbiter betwee n the Government an I people of Ihi^
country on questions of ccnstitutioral liberty The
experience of a 1 ages and oounfeshas derntn
süated that judges nstme ively 1< ?n towards the
prerogatives of Government, and it is notorious
that the court, during the wlule period which he
presided over it, embracing «o many ye,ir ot its
existence, has inclined towards ihe highes asser-
tion of Federal power That this has been done
honestly and conscientiously, I eneitain not a
doubt
The principle of cor tnut onai construction
which woull deduce the power to establish s> Bank
of the Ui ited St  is from t e source «he e it is
said to ex st, would b akdown all the barriers
ereclelbyour fathers between F deial and S ate
authority If jou can infer this poner fnm Ihe
simpl" power p taxation m iheC ns ituiion, I a k
what other powri ihicu you may desire to exerci e
m-y not be inferredfiom hat ir some otner clause?
An ingenious man nght thusf-stsri any power
which Congress or the President rnav desir° 10 ex
ercise, on some one of the expr ss prints contained
in the conslitu ion * But the incident cannot
transe?nd its principal—the stream cannot ascend
higher than its fountain and upon the mere power
of levying the taxes neces ary to support ?n
economical Government, you can never erect a
vast corpcntion to overshadow the whole laid,
a d, if not in fo m, yet in substance, to change ibe
character of all our institution Never, neve ,
can you fairly infer the existence of the power to
create a Bank from hat of the p-wer "to ¡ay t d
collect taxes " But it nenh r v as nur is my pur-
p se to en er upon theeonst tutional argument i jr

The committee say that "thej ha  e adopted
Washing on city, proposed by the Secretar/ oí the
Tieasury, as th" place <f location of t e principal
Bank" The Sen-tor from Kentucky [Mr. Clay]
has intormed us that h° felt a si ght preierence fi r
other places, but he agrees with the committee in
believing that this is "a subordinate question " He
has, therefore, I suppose, kindly yielded the point
to his companions on the committee, for the sake
of harmony Now, sir, I consider this point which
he has tbus surrendered to be of the very last
importance
Washington city, then —a place destitute of com-
merce, either foreign or domestic—is the chosen
home of this gr^at central money power If you
desite a tank for the purpose of facilitating the
commercf, «ncouragmg the manufactures, and
promotirg the agriculture of the country, Wash-
ington cttv i the very worst spot f< r its location
vhich could >e selected within the broad limits of
the Union Bit, sir, if you wish to establish a great
Treasury Bauir, which shall be under the direct in-
fluence and control of the Government, this, above
all plaees > ihe umver-e, t' tr>e very place for its
location Tie reason is palpable Here the mo-
ney power o I the Union will be brought into con
junciitn wi h the political power, and here they
will act tege her in perfect concert and harmony.
Hencef rward there will be no jarring between
these tyvo high power
Now, su, whatever may have been the
dewgn of i s projectors, this Fiscal Agent,
should it t ver b* established, will be, both m fact
and in form, nothing more nor less tnan a Govern
ment Bank If I were asked for a definition of a
Government Bauk, could I give a better one than
to say it >s a bank over whose directors the Go-
vein nent will possess, from the very nature of its
oiganization, a controlling influence,—whose stcck
will be chief!/ owned by the Government,—whose
surp'us pr< h t be>ond a limited dividend to pri
vate stockh Iders, will all beiong to the Govern-
ment,—and whose chief source of profit will be to
loan out to individuáis, and use, according to Us
own  discre i >n, the money of the Government?  I
hink I couli noi. give a more perfect defi i ion «f
such a B ink Inin i embraced in the particulars
which I have ju.t enumerated If this be true, and
who can doubt it, then this Fiscal Bank of the Uni-
ted States v ¡h be a Gi vernment Bank
And, ii tne fir t place, tne Government will have
a controlling influence over the directors of its own
Fiscal Agent Who will these direc'ors be' Not
merchants, t it manufacturers, not men actually
engaged in b smess. Such men will never leav 
their home a d tVir empKyment, to reside in this
city, ¿ndkb come directors d this Bmk They will
rema n m B sun, in New York, in Pmladelphia,
in Baltimore, in Richmond, and every where else
except in this city, attending to their business Here
no such pr i< ica! men can be found, and the Sena-
tor from Kentucky is, therefore, of opinion that the
direeiors oug it to be selected beyond the limits of
th  Distric Who, then, will these directors be?
Does it not rrsult, from the very nalmeof things
that they mu t be politicians? Who would come
t this cm, and spend the whole, or the greater
p^r of the j ar here, as a director of this Bank,
unless it werí wme p lit cal cormo BTit desirous
of obtaining u fluence for himself and office for bis
family  and   friends?    Now         if you desire to
