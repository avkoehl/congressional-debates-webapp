Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN, Secretary of War:.

SIR: I have just had the honor to receive your letter of the 26th instant, inclosed with one to General Beauregard, assigning him to command at Columbus, Ky..

General Beauregard will be relieved from his present command to-morrow..

I reg ret very much that it is thought necessary to remove this distinguished officer from this district, especially at the present time, when the recent law granting bounty and furloughs, &amp;c., is having a disorganizing effect.

In this connection permit me to urge the necessity of this army for the general officers I have asked for more than once..

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,.

I am sorry that I can afford little information and less aid in relation to the important and interesting objects of your communication. The troops under my command have generally come into the my department with arms in their hands. I had and have no means of ascertaining by whom the arms were furnished. I understand that Virginia does not wish to reclaim arms now in actual use. As some arms have become disposable by the death or discharges of soldiers, they have been withdrawn from my control under orders of the War Department of the Confederate States. These orders have been repeatedly issued by the Department and executed by me. Of late they have gone to the length of taking the arms of the sick. When removed from this army, the arms of course passed under the direct control of the Department of .
