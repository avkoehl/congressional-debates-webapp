1834.                                 THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                  258
ident for this purpose was, he thought, the very
vorst that could be devsed
Hedweltupon the injurious effects which would
follow a i eduction of the currency The whole
property of the State of Georgia he estimated at
seventy millions of dollars, and its circulatirg
medium four millions If the circulation was re-
duced to two millions, the property, he said, would
be reduced in price to thirty five m.lnons, and
another reduction of the currency to one million,
would reduce the value of the property to seven-
teen and a half millions What would be the
effect upon maividuals 5 A man who has a thou-
sand dollars in property and owes two hundred
and fifty dolíais becomes barkrupt Those who
happen to have the money, become possessed of
all the property in the State Thus it had always
b°en, and thus the fortunes of the poor were to be
promoted by the present expeutrent Mi W
adverted to Mr Duane's statement that the Presi-
dent had remarked that two thirds of Congress
would have been bribed by the bank if they had
remained in session one week longer, also to
the reports that it was the intention of the Presi-
dent to adjourn Congress, m case of a disagree-
ment between the two Houses as to the time of
adjournment, and commented upon them with
much severity The committee, Mr W said,
had decided questions which they had not argued,
and had argued questions which they had not de-
cided They shun putting to the House the simple
proposition, that the reasons of the Secretary are
satisfactory, and put before it the proposition that
the bank ought not to berecharteied We under-,
stand this, sn, said Mr W It is to show the'
strong wing to the enemy, and to keep out of view
the weak one
But of wnatuse is the declaration that the bank
ought not to be rechartered ' The bank don't ask a
recharter of us, and we cannot bind our successoi s
The Administration desire to comm t us, but why
should we desire to commit ourselves? Let the
Go< ernment go on with its scheme If the State
banks fail, let them try a specie currency, and every
other project But when all their piojects have
failed, let us be left untrammelled to try a scheme
which never has failed He had intended to con-
clude his speech by a motion to lay the proposition
of the committee on the table But as many wished
to express their opinions upon it, he had deter-
mined, instead of making that motion, upon offering
the resolution which he had sent to the table After
some further remarks, Mr  W  concluded
On motion of Mr PINCKNEY,
The House adjourned

he desired only to have ltprmted and laid on the
table for the present    Agreed ta
Mr C also reported a bill making grants of land
to disbanded officers and others, for sei vices during
the late war, which was read twice, and he then
moved to have it committed to the Committee of
the Whole on the state of the Union
Mi MASON, of Vnginia, objected to its com-
m tnent to any but the usual committer for such
subjects—the Committee of the Whole House
Mr WILLIAMS said that bills as interesting
as this had been lefeired to the Committee of the
Whole House
Mr CLAY said the bill had been reported at
the instance of various Legislatures of the Union
He wished to have its consideration msuied during
this session, for which pu pose he moved its ref-
erence to the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union
Mi MASON considered that this was in its
nature a pnvate bill he could not^ therefore, see
any reason why precedence should be given to it
over all others fife moved its commitment to the
Committee of tne W iole
Mr CLAY remaiked, that although the bill
should be sent to the committee which he desired,
yet it did not follow that it would have any pref-
ei ence given to it, unje&s it should be the pleasure
of the House to take it up

|     The House proceeded with the following resolu-
tion submitted by Mi Mardis
Resolved, That the Committee of Ways and
Means bemstructed to inquire into the expediency
of repoitmg a bill requiring the Secretary of the
Treasury to deposite the public moneys of the
United States in the State banks, and, also, as to
the expediency of defining by law all contracts
hereafter to be made with the Secretary for the
safe-keeping, management, and disbursement of
the same
Mr BURGES resumed his remarks, and spoke
in opposition to the resolution until the expiration
of the hour allotted for morning business
The CHAIR communicated to the House a re-
port from the Secretary of Wai, transmitting the
Annual Registerof the Army. Laidon the table,
and ordered to be printed
THE DEPOSITES AND UNITED STATES BANK.
The House resumed the consideration of the
resolutions reported from the Committee of Ways
and Means, together with the amendment moved,
by Mr Wilde, of Georgia, declaring the reasons
offered by the Secietary oí the Treasury for re-
moving the deposites to be unsatisfactory and
insufficient
Mr PINCKNEY, of South Carolina, took the
floor His reasons for rising to occupy the atten-
tion of the House for comparatively a short time,
after the able arguments ot thegentleman who had
pieceded him, was the interest which his con-
stituents felt n the question He represented a
city which was deeply concerned in commerce,
navigation, and agriculture, and which now felt all
the embarrassments growing out of the measures
of the Executive Recent advices from Chailes-
ton infoimed him that rice, which ordinarily was
worth $350, was now scarcely worth $275 Lands,
negroes, and town property, had fallen to a most
alaimmg extent The losses sustained by South
Carolina alone, if accuiately ascertained, would be
found to be laige enougn to excite the sympathy
of every individual on this floor, and perhaps of
the President himself Under these circumstances,
he would be recreant to his duties did he not
express his .sentiments on the subject before the
House Before he proceeded to discuss the main.
question, he must be allowed to touch upon a few
incidental points, even at the risk of provoking the
ridicule of his fiiend from Kentucky, who had
remarked that he [Mi Pivckney] could talk upon,
nothing without introducing nullification The
opinions which he entertained on that subject
were, he believed, the same which the gentleman,
under similar eircumstarces, would entertain He
reminded the gentleman, too, that the doctrine
originated in Kentucky It was m that State that
íesolutions were adopted in reference to the alien
and sediuon laws, declanng that nullification was
thenghtfulremedy, a principle upon which South
Carolina had stood, and struggled, and ti lumphed.
He had already, on a former occasion, noticed the
attempt to create the belief that all who were op-
posed to the removal of the deposites v ere in favor
of the recnartei of the bank The merchants had
also been attacked lheir deputations were not
only repelled with indignity, but now they were
denounced as enemies to liberty As far as his
constituents were concerned, he repelled the at-
tack, and as to the gieat body of the merchants,
hepionounced it to be uhj jst and unfounded
Mr P went on to speekef the character of the
President's motives, which, he said, could not, if
good, lustifyhis measuies, and hereferred to Mr
Dujne's letters foi an explanation of the principles
on which the President acted It might be that
his language was disrespectful to the President,
i and he might be told, as the Governor of Virginia
was, that he had no right to hold any opinion m
respect to the Presidert'scourse Thegentleman
from Virginia [Mr Moore] exulted in the idea
that the proclamation hid destroyed nullification.
Poes he not know that this doctrine brought Mr
Jefferson and the Republican party into power'
And does he exult that the doctrines of Jeffeison
have been destroyed by Jackson' that the doctrine
of Virginia has been swept away by the procla-
mation ' Buthe need not lay that flattering unction
to his soul Thedoctnneisnow more liimly estab-
lished than ever Thousands were now convinced
who formerly doubted The proclamation had
not only confirmed the State Rights party in South
'  Carolina in their opinions, but has gained thou-
