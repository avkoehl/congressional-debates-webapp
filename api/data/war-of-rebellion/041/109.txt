MAY 27.

Commodore PALMER:

All is going well with the army; they push the rebels hard on the right. Do not fire again.

ALDEN,

Captain

MAY 30.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The shells fired from the mortar fleet at the batteries at 1 o'clock this morning fell on the right of our lines; five-eights of a mile to west, with same range, and you will hit the enemy's forts, or 100 yards to left, and you will hit their rifle-pits.

G. WEITZEL

General.

MAY 30.

Admiral FARRAGUT;

General Weitzel says continue the firing as we direct.

STATION AT THOMPSON'S CREEK.

May 31.

Captain WILLIAM B. ROE:

I was on the point opposite Port Hudson yesterday p.m. Tell General Banks or General Weitzel I would like to repeat my trip, and bring my notes for examination to-night. A battery of Parrott guns would be a thorn in their side. Roads go do levee high, range short.

S. M. EATON,

Lieutenant.

MAY 31.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

Let the mortars fire on that gun which shot at us last night.

WEITZEL,

General.

General BANKS:

An orderly reached Bayou Sara last night with dispatches for the Hartford. Not waiting transportation, he started by land, and has not yet arrived.

S. M. EATON,

Lieutenant.

JUNE 2.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

If possible, I will send the Parrott guns to your side. It offers a good position. We are getting in position for a vigorous attack, and are confident of success. We are getting the large guns up to-day. I will keep you well informed, and am sorry so few messages reach you.

N. P. BANKS,

General.

JUNE 2.

General BANKS:

Your telegrams about Parrott guns for the Point received. Do not think it safe. Have written fully.

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Admiral.

JULY [JUNE] 2.

Admiral FARRAGUT:

The steamer Crescent is here. She will return in the morning to New Orleans.

JOHN WATTERS.
