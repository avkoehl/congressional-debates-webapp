CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr FILLMORL moved that the HoM^e resolve iteeif into
Committee of the Whole on the state uf the Union
The resolution of Mr Adams was thereupon laid over
LOÁIS i ILL
And the House again resolved into Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union (Mr   Brtggs of Massachusee s m the
chair) on the bill authorizing a I ^an not exceeding twelve mil
lions of dolían
The pending euestion being on the motion to strike ou , the
enacting clause of the bill-
Mr JONES of Virginia, who was entitled to the floor, said
herose iorthefirst time toaddiessa kgislative bo iy bytne
clock A rule of the House made it the duty of the chairman
to say to him, sixty minutes irom this time he must resume his
seat
Mr J said that the loan proposed by this bill was to pay, as
was alleged, the debts oí the preceding Administration It
wasabill based upon a report which if hewasto judge from
its great accuracy, must have cost its au hoi many a day of
hard labor, and over which probably he must oft have burned
his own midnight lamp Time would not allow him (Mr J )
tosayallthat he desired to say up->n that document, but he
was in hopes that putting together the fragments of time occu
pied m us examination by those who had preceded him, and
who probably ¡right yet come alter him,) they would be ena
bied to present it to the House and to the countiy, in such a
way as that it nugnt be p^tftc ly unrleistood
This was a financial question It w^s I is intention to con
sider it absuch 3nd if he did not demon trate that there existed
no necessity foi this loan 01 in other word that theie would
be no deficiency at the elo-apoi the present yeai it wr uklnotbc
becau&ehe had not the most aupe material to make to id
that position, hut the fault wool í heniher in ihe one lour
rule to which he had referred, 01 i would be in himself It
might be that he should be able soto pi erent the ficta as to
enable the House ai d the countiy to see the n a? in tiuth they
existed.
Theie was no'subject in which the peoplejustlv felt a deeper
interest than m the revenues and expenditure5* of their Govern
ment, and to keep them correctly advised of the i real burdens
was no less in  duty oftho0e charged with the administration
of the Government itself, than of their own immediate Repie
aentatives His own experience hal taught him that there wa=¡
a great difficulty 11 this task—a difficulty perhaps inherent in
the subject itself, but vastly increased by tho«e difficulties
which it was at ah times m the power of ingenious partisans
to throw around it Thisiemarkhe did not apply exclusively
to any party, for he knew that to some extent, it was alike ap
plicable to all

then alluded to the opoortunny which he «aid, had been given
at the last Congress ftomthe composition of the committees
under Mr Speaker Hunter to make revelatuns a  to the
state of the Departments if any c mid be made and to the fail

was the result'1 Had they ma e it p^aL that there were
debts a id labilities on the pait of the Government to the
amount of forty millions oí d lllars as hal been contended for
by a prominent member of the WhiCT paity lrom the fetale of
New York, [Mr Barnard,] and wiose statement* (greatly
magnified, however) were ( n the lips ofeverj man who under

been able to show that, wf on the 4xh of Match last, there wa« a

the United Sna es was leovtllv chargeable'* Jir 1 irsi&ted
that there was ?iot, and examined wi h giedt minuteness the
statements made m the repor of ¡he secretary oi the Treasury
to sustain tin-* position
If then Mr J sail there was such a debt, how did the Secte
tary make it out1 And what became of the ch-ree of a forty
millions debt1* for so it would be understood, although he wa*-
bound t believe since the gentleman f'om New York [Mi
Barhand] had disclaimed that s ich was not the intention But
even those who ma ie the chaige must admit if they would loek

in the first instance, but now abundantly manifest
He came now to the report of the Secretary of the Treasury,
wnii a. he must chaiactenze rts delusive, deceptive, and eminent
iy caiculited to mislead the public mind, though piobably not
so intended He (Mr 7 ) did not charge th it it wis «so intended,
but he spoke of the document as he found it And when he
mide s ich a declaration, it would be expected that he should
furnish ^ome evidence ol its truth This he would now proceed
todo ¡n his opinion, there was no individual in the couatry
who had more right to complain of this report than the Piesi
deru himself He (Mi T ) made no charge ¿earnst tbePresi
dent is to any statements Vvlnch he might have made They
weie based he tooki for granted, upon papéis furnished to
him, foi although it was to be supposed that the President
should he generally acquainted with all the financial affairs of
the countiy, yet he could not be expected to understand the de
tails of every thing so well as the offieer who had the e peciai
charee of the Department
Mr T then proceeded to point out the alleged discrepancies to
be found between he statements of the Pre^i lentofthe United
^tates-and thereof the tsecretaiy of theTieasury inflation to
the f nances He contende 1 by figures, that the President had
been misled that this House hsd been no ess so that the pab
lie press all over the rounti y had been misled and that it was to
be expected that the people would fait even into still gieater
err rs
Fiom this topic, Mr J passed on to examine the e tímate  of

the showing of thr Secretaiy, the means of the Government
would amount to ©20 730000 Now, by the word "means."
Mr D understood money, cash, or something that was avail
able othei than Treasury notes Mr D here went into a list of
the items of which this gross aura was made up Deducting
ihe amount of Tieasury notes, and the interest upon them, Üxa
sum would be reduced to a little over fifteen millions But then
there was a further deduction to be made for notes that would
romo in, amounting to $5,648,000 Subtracting this amount
from the fifteen millions and upward, would leave in the Trea-
sury of available means at the command of Government, hut
«10,966,000
Mr 1) challenged any gentleman to demonstrate that the
amount would exceed this sum Yet the gentleman from North
Caioiina [Mr McKay] had ventured to advance the very extra-
ordinary position that, after the payment of all the Treasury
notes, there would still be twenty millions left in the Treasury
The gentleman had mistaken the true amount by the small pro-
portion of one half
The next question was, whether the estimates of the Secre
tary as to accruing revenue were too low1 On that subject
one fact furnished a piettygood criterion to judge by The
estimates fium the customs for the quarter just expired had
been three millions, whereas the actual amount received, it had
now been ascertained, had been about nine hundred thousand
dollar*    The inference was, that the estimates erred, it at all,
being too laige
As to the public lands, it was known to every gentleman that
he sales had recently been suspended This suspension was
one of the legitimate fruits of a favorite measure of that gentle-
man viz the pre em| uon law The settlers who had gone
upon the \ ublic domain finding themselves unable to pay for
their farms, had petitioned the Ptesidem to make this suspen-
sion, and their request had been complied with This was a
relief measure, ihe policy of which Mr D gveatly doubted It
set a bad precedent, and, o ce -begun, the sytem was very like
ly to be continued One suspension led to another Mr D here
went into a list of items m the Secretary's report, commenting
on them as he proceeded One of them was 294)000 dollars,
still due for the expense of taking the late census, and, though
it had been appropna'ed, jthad not yet been demanded, and
therefoie foimed a charge upon the Treasury Between the
1st of June last and the 1st of September next ensuing, there
was to be disbursed eleven millions of dollars, four and a half of
wh ch was foi the military service Now, Mr D considered it
very unfair to complain of the laigeness of this amount, inas-
much at. there weie great arrears of labor to be performed,
win h ought to have been accomplished m previous years, and
the summer was the time into which the work must for the
most pait be crowded Of these eleven millions, the Secretary
had but five millions in his hands Was any gentleman here
leady to take theiesponsibdity ofrefusinsto provide for these
woiksof defence? Vet, m the face of this ebviousantt glaring
deficiency of means, gentlemen would have the audacity to
n=em their places and tell the nation that the Secretary had
rreano en nigh in his h nds
Mr D here releired o, andreal largely fiom, a printed
&} eech in which it had been attempted to show that theactual
deficit in LheTreasuiv was tnu 1  1,740 000, and that the Secie
taiyin his report had been at least fourteen millions wide of
the truth loarnvc at such an extraordinary conclusion as
this, the author of the speech had assumed the whole twenty-
four millions stated by the Secretary to be available means,
such as could be realised, apart from Treasury netesj whereas
Mr D ba 1 airea ly shown that the true amount of such means
was not ovei $10900000 This was in fact, whatever itmight
have bet n in intention, piactismg deception upon the country,
it counted on Treasury notes as so much income, instead of so
much charge and buiden upon the Treasuiy
Gentlemen had tiled to make a greatdeal out of alleged dis
crtp«.n Lie^ bi. tucen the statements of the President m his mes
«dge md of the --ecretarv in his report but, m truth, there was
no discrepancy whatever, b cause they rested on statements
made at different dates OU was bated on the report of the
Register of the Treasury wi rch came up to the 27th of May,
the other on that of the Tiea^urerof the United States, which
went up to the 1st of June
Before gentlemen withhold their votes from this bill, let
them show that the Government had available means at
its disposal to meet its debts and liabilities The Secretary
wanted twenty six millions, two millions and upwardss of which
consisted of arrears left on bis hinds by the late Administration
They suggested, d\ pieferaule to this hi), a new emission of
Treas ry m es Mr ii hoped that no such measure would
