Report of Lieutenant Colonel William D. Ward, Thirty-seventh Indiana Infantry.
HDQRS. THIRTY-SEVENTH INDIANA VOL. INFANTRY,Atlanta, Ga., September 9, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of this command during the campaign, commencing May 7, 1864, and ending September 8, 1864:

On the 7th day of May the regiment broke camp at Ringgold, Ga., and marched about eight miles and bivouacked in about three miles of Buzzard Roost. The next day the regiment moved about two miles to the front, and on the 9th of May the regiment moved in line of battle across an open field under the fire of the enemy, and took position on a hill in a short range of the enemy's artillery and sharpshooters. This position was held until 10 p. m. May 10, 1864, when the regiment was relieved by the Fifty-first Ohio Volunteer
