HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,May 29, 1864-3 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Barlow has advanced 3 miles on the road from this point and has reached the forks leading to Hanover Court-House and to Cold Harbor. He has passed the scene of yesterday's cavalry fight, 1 1/2 miles. He neither sees nor hears of anything of the enemy. From all I can learn I am under the impression the enemy has withdrawn behind the Chickahominy, but as yet this is only surmise. Nothing reported from General Wright or Warren. No firing heard.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

HAW'S HOUSE, May 29, 1864-3.30 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

General Barlow reports meeting a skirmish line of the enemy supposed to be cavalry. The people in the vicinity tell him there is a line of battle 1 mile ahead on Southard's Branch. Barlow is advancing to ascertain the true state of the case.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

MAY 29, 1864-4 p. m.

Major-General MEADE, Second Corps Headquarters:

It will be well to keep the troops that have gone in search of the enemy to the front and close up on them in the morning, or, if you think their position unsafe, strengthen the front to-night. If the enemy has gone behind the Chickahominy the trains should all be brought to the south side of the Pamunkey in the morning. Your dispatch of 3.30 just received since writing the above. If the enemy is found in the position described by General Barlow, he had better be supported before making the attack. They are probably only covering whilst getting everything well ready to receive us on the south side of the creek.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

HAW'S SHOP, May 29, 1864-5.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Barlow has met the enemy in force about 4 miles from this point. He reports artillery in position and infantry in rifle-pits. In accordance with your dispatch I have directed General Hancock to support him, and he is now moving out with his corps. General Griffin met the enemy about 1 mile from the Totopotomoy ont he road to Shady Grove, and is now skirmishing with him. General Warren is prepared to support him. General Wright reports his reconnaissance being within one-fourth mile of the railroad. Hanover Court-House in sight; only cavalry pickets encountered. He will be directed to hold his advance position and support them if necessary.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
