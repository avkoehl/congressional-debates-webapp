broad fields are waving with rich grain nearly ready for the sickle? The Government demands only your surplus supplies, and for them will pay remunerative prices. Fortify the hearts of our soldiers, then, by showing that while they illustrate the chivalry of Georgia upon the tented field, we at home are ready to dispense with all superfluities, relinquish all luxuries, and make any sacrifice necessary to maintain and perpetuate our honor and our liberties. While we may have erred in our judgment as to what is a fair compensation for some of the articles in the above schedule of prices, we feel that we have stood impartially between the Government and the producer, and while protecting one have not lost sight of the other. We have omitted to annex prices to certain articles, either on account of their scarcity or because the Government is fully supplied. At the proper time prices will be fixed for all.
