(Received 25th.)

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Scouts report Fort Morgan ceased firing 6 a. m. yesterday; whole interior in flames. About 1 p. m. heavy explosion took place in fort. No enemy's ships at wharf. Attack of Mobile may commence at once. Need much more and good troops and ammunition. Enemy has retired from Oxford. His advance passed Holly Springs 10 a. m. yesterday. General Taylor expects to cross into this department in a few days. State troops come in slowly; much sickness amongst them.

Major-General.

Major General D. H. MAURY,

Commanding Dept. of Ala., Miss., and East La., Mobile, Ala.:

DEAR SIR: I am directed by Governor Clark to urge you to aid in arming his troops. We have now 5,000 in camp and not half of them armed. MISSISSIPPI will not have less than 9,000 or 10,00 troops ready in a few days, and we fear from present prospects that arms cannot be procured. Captain Evans, the ordnance officer at this place, seems to be doing all in his power, yet the arms do not come fast enough to arm the men. Your strong helping hand will no doubt facilitate matters. Give it to us and let MISSISSIPPI elevate herself.

Wishing you well, I am, very respectfully,

J. D. STEWART,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Ordnance, State of Mississippi.
