HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 3, 1863-8 a. m. (Received 5. 10 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The action commenced again at early daylight upon various parts of the line. The enemy thus far have made no impression upon my position. All accounts agree in placing the whole army here. Prisoners report Longstreet's and A. P. Hill's forces much injured yesterday and many general officers killed. General Barksdale`s (Mississippi) dead body is within our lines. We have thus far sent off about 1, 600 prisoners, and a small number yet to be started. I have given certain instructions to General French, which he will telegraph you. The dispatches from you yesterday, owing to the disappearance of Caldwell, telegraph operator, are here in cipher, unintelligible.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK, (Received 11 p. m.)

General-in-Chief:

At the present moment all is quiet. Considerable firing, both infantry and artillery, has taken place in various parts of our line, but no development of the enemy's intentions. My cavalry are pushing the enemy on both my flanks, and keeping me advised of any effort to outflank me. We have taken several hundred prisoners since morning.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The enemy opened at 1 p. m. from about 150 guns, concentrated upon my left and center, continuing without intermission for about

three hours, at the expiration of which time he assaulted my left center twice, being upon both occasions handsomely repulsed, with severe loss to him, leaving in our hands nearly 3, 000 prisoners; among the prisoners, Brigadier-General Armistead and many colonels and officers of lesser rank. The enemy left many dead upon the

field and a large number of wounded in our hands.
