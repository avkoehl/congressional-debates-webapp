cruits. Inclosed I send a form* of account to be used for the dismounted troops. The form of account explains itself. I propose dismounting the troops at Lewisville and transferring the dismounted men at once to the infantry.

I have the honor to be, general, your obedient servant,

J. BANKHEAD MAGRUDER,

Major-General, Commanding District of Arkansas.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF ARKANSAS,Washington, December 20, 1864.

Brigadier General W. R. BOGGS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following plans for the organization of the cavalry of this district are submitted for the approval of the general commanding department. The first is the one I most approve and recommend:

PLAN FIRST.

Cabell's Brigade Arkansans.

Men.

Monroe's regiment (Webb's, Kidder's and Roberts' unattached

companies)................................................ 495

Slemon's regiment and Harrell's battalion, consolidated... 400

Crawford's and Gordon's regiments, consolidated........... 400

Marmaduke's Brigade Missourians.

Greene's regiment......................................... 400

Lawther's regiment........................................ 400

Burbridge's regiment...................................... 400

Shelby's Brigade Missourians.

Gordon's regiment.......................................... 500

Shanks' regiment........................................... 500

Smith's regiment........................................... 500

Elliott's regiment......................................... 500

Brooks' Brigade Arkansans.

Newton's regiment.......................................... 300

Logan's and Stirman's regiments, consolidated.............. 300

Slayback's regiment........................................ 300

My reasons for approving this plan are: First, that the whole number of cavalry is less than in any organization proposed; second, that it will give greater satisfaction and is more symmetrical, and comes practically within the limits laid down by the general commanding department.

In his letter of the 9th instant, he states that he desires that I shall form two brigades one to be Shelby's and to other to be Marmaduke's or Cabell's, and one other small brigade. I have formed two small brigades and two medium sized, effecting a greater reduction of the cavalry than in any other way, and not dismounting either of the old cavalry brigades, which would create great dissatisfaction and would not seem to be right.
