general gives you carte blanche, provided you do not unduly risk the loss of your command. Bayard will be instructed to-morrow to move toward Warrenton. When you reach Sperryville the general desires that you send him the latest news. He will send infantry in the direction of Culpeper as soon as possible, but do not calculate on it. Depend upon your own resources. You will be kept fully posted as to the position of the troops.

Major-General SIGEL,

Thoroughfare Gap:

General McClellan directs me to inform you that the troops are in the position indicated in my dispatch of last evening.* General Franklin's corps will be in the vicinity of and in front of White Plains to-morrow. General Pleasonton, with his b rigade of cavalry, met a superior force of the enemy's cavalry at Barbee's to-day, drove them back, and the last report we had from [him] said that he was following the enemy toward Chester Gap.

P. S., 11.20 p. m. - The general desires me to add that he has just received a dispatch from General Pleasonton, near Sandy Hook, who says that he thinks the enemy's cavalry that he defeated to-day are going to Warrenton, although they made for chester Gap, and that the greater part of their infantry have passed Sandy Hook. He apprehends that they may attempt to strike you a blow near Warrenton. General McClellan thinks it may be well for you to look out in that direction, although he is in position to give you any support that may be necessary. General Pleasonton will probably be thrown in rear of Warrenton to-morrow.
