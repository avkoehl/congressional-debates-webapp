HDQRS. DEPT. OF Mississippi AND EASTERN LOUISIANA,Jackson, MISS., April 14, 1863.

Major L. MIMS, Chief Quartermaster, Jackson, MISS.:

MAJOR: In connection with the accompanying communication from General Stevenson, referred to you, I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say he thinks it better to haul the machinery, iron,&amp;c., to Vaughn's Station from Yazoo City, and that to take off the wagons from hauling corn to Vicksburg would be to prevent the accumulation of corn, &c., on the line of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, which is now so much desired.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MAJOR: In reply to your communication of the 13th instant, asking for information in relation to the amount of supplies that can be collected at once on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad, say at Meridian, Enterprise, Macon, and Columbus, I have the honor to state I am accumulating supplies rapidly along the line of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad; but the amount I can collect it is difficult for me to determine with any accuracy. Inclosed is a consolidated statement of the store now at different points along the road. * As they accumulate I will inform you.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
