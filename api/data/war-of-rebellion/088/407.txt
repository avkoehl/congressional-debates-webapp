(Through General Warren's headquarters.)

General Warren reports the enemy to have retired from his front and that his pickets are moving forward, feeling. The commanding general directs that you maintain a corresponding movement on General Warren's left flank. Prisoners report W. H. F. Lee's division and Dearing's brigade on the enemy's right.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

Blick House, Weldon Railroad, August 22, 1864-11.30 a.m.

Brigadier-General GREGG,Commanding Cavalry:

The major-general commanding directs that you report at once the disposition you have made of your force to protect the party destroying the railroad and cover the left flank of the army; and that you establish your headquarters within easy communication of this point, communicating and co-operating with the commander of the infantry at this point, Major-General Warren, as well as with the commanding general. A division of infantry of the Second Corps will be sent to co-operate in the protection of the railroad party, and for the purpose of destroying it.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

August 22, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General GREGG,Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: It was the disposition of you whole force and not the mere picket-line that was wanted. It was expected that you would have a considerable part of your force concentrated on or near the railroad, or the roads adjacent, for the operations required of you. The commanding-general thinks it better to retain Colonel Spear to increase your force for such purposes. Some part of the country or line you are endeavoring to picket is represented to be impassable, and if so, needs but very few pickets. It appears that the only point at which our cavalry is in contact with the enemy is about Colonel Wyatt's. The commanding general directs that you feel for the enemy's cavalry line, and ascertain how it is posted and connected with the enemy's infantry. General Warren will furnish you an infantry support should you need it upon your calling on him.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
