and thirtieth Indiana Volunteers, Colonel Charles S. Parrish commanding, and the One hundred and twenty-ninth Indiana Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel McGuire commanding, were moved to our former position behind the works. The One hundred and twenty-third Indiana Volunteers, Lieutenant-Colonel Walters commanding, went into and fortified a position on the left of the Trent road. One company (H), One hundred and twenty-third Indiana Volunteers, Lieutenant W. F. Burk commanding, was sent forward one mile, and found the enemy had abandoned his position in our front. The command remained in position, as above stated, during the night.

In closing this report I wish to say that the officers and men, without exception, acted with coolness and bravery, and promptly executed every movement ordered, and in my opinion merit the confidence of our commanding general.

Herewith I send the reports of regimental commanders, and append a complete list of casualties of the brigade. *

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN C. McQUISTON,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigade.
