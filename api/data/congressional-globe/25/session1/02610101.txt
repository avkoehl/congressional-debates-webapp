willing to proceed cautiously, and not, at the first,
go the length of demanding exclusive specie pay-
ments.
But the Senator from South Carolina has thought
differently, and I shall be compelled to voie tor or
agaanst his amendment Giving e/ery considera-
tion its proper weight, I have, since he has agreed
to modify it, determined to yield it my support As
it now stands, the notes of specie-paying banks n ill
be receivable in the payment ot all the public dues
up-ltllthe la&t day of the year 1838 during the
year 1839, o-e-fourth will be required m specie,
during the year 1840, one-hall, during thejear
1841, tbree-fouitbs, and not until the year 1842
shall we reach the point ol exclusive specie pay-
ments Its operation will be slow and gradual,
arid if, m the mean time, we should discover, it
any stage of its piogiess, that it is too severe, we
can easdy change the law
What objections have been uiged against the
entire s) stem presetted by the bill and the amend-
ment'
The first is, that it will increase Executive patron-
age To this I flatter, myself I have already given
a conclusive answer
The "second is, that it will operate with such se-
venty upon the banks, and through them upon ihe
countiy, as to produce wide-spread disastei and
ruin Gentlemen have taxed then irmsinations
to present the scene of suffering and desolation
which it will pioduce
Now, sir, I cannot leah/e any of these horrors
The cause is too impotent to pioduee any cuch effects
On the contiaiy, I fen that it will go but a small
u ay indeed towards checking the exti avagant i sues
oí the banks, and thai its influence will scarcely be
felt With tne public revenue i educed to tie
standard of the public expenses which it now is
and probably will be for man} >eais to como, ti e
specie mil flow out of the Treasuiy almost as ía-
pidly as it flows in It will be kept in constant cir-
culation. The accu tnulation must be comparative-
ly trifling According to the estimate of the Presi-
dent, ten millions of dollars m gold and silver will
be suffic lent for the purpose of paying and disburs-
ing our annual revenue I think his estimate ex-
travagant, because one dollar Mill make many pay-
ments in the course ot the same vear The opeia-
tion of the system w ill be ver) gradual, and the
necessaiy quantity ol specie will gtadually be
brought into cucuhtion « ithout pro luc imi) m-
¡unou>results to the banks Itma\,aid 1 trust
will, m i>ome degree curtail theirextravagant issues,
and thus benefit the community, and render their
own condition more sound After the year 1838,
theie probably may, and I trust will, be a somewhat
greater demand upon them foi specie than there has
been, but this specie will go into the genual circu-
lalionof the country, and thus gold aid silver will
be made, to a greater "xiept, the basis oí our piper
circulat on Will any Senatoi object to o1 r-h a
change1
Why, sir, when last m New Yoih, I was in-
formed that the money U nsactions m Wall street
often amounted to £,5,000,000 pei dav Fhe tiade
and business of our countrv is vas , almost be-
vond conception The receipts and disbtusements
of the Government Ivmi but a very tutlin^ pro-
poitton to the re< eipts a id pa) roents oí mdi\ iduals
How, then, can it be ippiehended for a moment,
that ten millions of dolkrs m spec e, finving into
the depositories m little nils, fiom eveiy poition of
the Union, and coistantlj ¿owing back agun to
the places fiom «hence it came, can produce anv
injurious effects upon the bus n°ss oithpr ot well
conducled banks "i ol the couiin' Away with i
such idle fears Upon trial, tney «ill be 1 lend to
be the meie ceation= or   ancy                               i
The banks might be injuuou'l}  affected   v ere I
if not for the amendment whiui was piooosed by ,
the Senator from M ssoun,  (Mi   Benton,) and
which I tiust miy beahpted     Th ¡> Mill oblige I
the holders of Tiea^ury d-ans on Jc¡h> itoii<"s to
present them for pav merit, wi hm a sinrt poind
Without such •> provision these drafts -n ould iw i-
tably go into the general circuí uion of the country
Representing ihe amount of silver and gold wmca
appears upon then face, and having the eventual
responsibility of the Government to sustain them,
if, in case of accident, they should not be pa'd bj
the denoiitory, they would be more valuable than
specie itself, fore\eiy puipose of lem ssion They
w< uld, therefore, remain m cucuhtion, whilst gold
and silver would accumulate in the Treasury
Specie would thus continue to be drawn fiom the
banks, to pav ihe dues of the Government, anda
great part of it would not return into circulation
The interest of the hanks íequires that this amend-
ment should be adopted, although these Tieasury
drafts would constitute to a limited e\tent, the
soundest and best medium of exchange which the
world ever saw
A thud objection to the proposed s)stem is, ihu
it -R dl furnish one land of currency for the people,
and another foi the Gov ernment or, in the lan-
guage of the Senatoi from Massachusetts, it will
set the offictis dovvn to the first table, and the peo
pie to the second Birectt) the reveise will be
the effect It is run object, by these measures, to
elevate the people to the first table, from ^vhIoh
thev have been excluded by the hankeis, and bro-
kers, and speculators of the countiy We wish to
spread before the Ameucan people a rich lepast, and
place them all upon the same level It is our pur-
pose, so far as the influence of this Government can
extend, to furnish them all with a currency of gold
and silver, oi of paper at all times convertible
into gold and silvei The only means we possess
of restiai ling th^se banks from making extravagant
over issues, and thus always pieserving them m a
cond t on to rec'oe n their notes in gol ( and sdi er,
ft to withhold from them our revenue, and require
the payment of our debts m specie It would be a
great blessing to the countiy if this can be ac om-
plishcd Has any Senator proposed that v e shall
rece te d«pielated bank paper inpayment of t e
public dues' Not one If we were to adopt such
a measure, it is tiu" we uuglu all sit down to the
same table, but it would be a table coveicd with
irredeemable and depreciated bank papei, witheut
hope for years to come of enjoying any better fare.
The Government must stand firm at Ibis cusís, m
order to secure a sound currency for all the people.
A fourth objection uiged against this system
has been its want of security, and that the public
money will not be safe in the hands of oui deposi-
tories This objee'ion comes with i bad grace
from those w ho desire again to entrust it to the
keeping of deposite banks I might sav, if I
thought piojiei, thai it will be at l—>st as s?fe m
the hands of ourofnceis as it has been in the depo-
site banks The} at least will not lock it up and
keep it altogether, unless you will leceive their owa
depreciated notes m payment The one experi-
ment has failed, and we have not yet tued the
other
But, sir, the pioposel mode of collecting and
keeping, and disbursing ihe public levenne, h?s
existed throughout tlip continent of Euinpe íom
th  da)s uf the Roman empue It is theiefore,
no  an uniiied experiment Is iheie anv reason
whv, nndei proper guards and lcstnciions, the
officers oí Government snould not sately k ep
u hat the) recciv e uti ll it isnecess?iv for them to
pay it out again"! Have we not as honest and
capable men in this cojntrj as in anv other1 No
plan which you can a lopt will altogether secuie
you against peculation, whist human naluie
remains as it is, bu* th s plan, securing as it does
the direct supei vision of the Secietary of the T>ea-
sury, an I the immediate responsibilii} to the Go-
's ernment of all the agents empkayed, furnishes as
great secui ty as any which can be devised The
truih is, that we hive been so accustomed to lean
exclusively upon banks in th'S countij, that we
fear t:> stand er"ct ?nd walk a'on , and rel) upon
our owr native s'rength
It has been suggested in a distinguished Southern
papei, (the Richmond B iquirer) whose opinions
are entitled to great íesp^ct, tnat the iuencls of the
aJmmistiation m gl r a'l unite in making a few
balks., at the p ine pal punts, the spe íal dtposito-
ues of oui moi" y My object un to a lopt this
pr posit'on arises from a conv etion tbat it vrouki
besto v exclusive privileges a" 1 advantage upon
these s^'eced banks, to the in,ury of a'l other simi-
lar m-tiHitions, and that it would, therefoie.greatlj
extend Executive patronage' What would be its >
opeiation? rue agent of the Gov ernment cójletfs afl

cially if the) were m cxtensn < credit The cosset
wonklpiv him m bank pipei, whilst an equal
amount in specie would be taken from the stiong
box of the Treasuiy and transfeiied to the vaul •>
ol the bank This would be the inevitable piocets
Tne orhcers of Government would thus be made
collectors of specie for these favored banks, to the
injur) of all the smioundirg mslituti ins, andan
extensu e cuculatioa would be secured to toeir notes
bj a knowledge of this verv fact No, sir, your(
due policy is to detach the Government from allf
banks Let them all stand upon the same footing,
and receive the same measure of justice from.
Congre <s
If anj thing could reconcile meto vote for the1"
amtudinent of the Senatoi horn Virginia, (Mr
Rivts,) ..t would be the hope—if I couiJ cherish
any such— that, thtough th  agency of the deposite
banks, we might procute a more extenled specie
basis fo'- oui papei cuirtncj But, even if we
could prevail upon them, which I very much doubt,
considering the small amount of out piesent de-
posits, to iorego the advantage of issuing five, ten,
oi twtntv dollai notes, and of receiving the notes
of othei banks who might refuse to enter into the
samr arrangement, what vv ould be the consequence'
Why, sir, the vacuum in the cnculation thus cre-
ated woud be immediate1/ filled by the notes oí
otnti bdnks of ihe denomm i'ion ot five and ten
dol!?rs Tl is von lia\e no povvoi to pi^vent
Th ie would be piecisely ihe same amount of cn-
culation in these smaller notes The only differ-
ence which could exist, would be, that ihey might
be furnished b) oilier banks of a less sound cha-
ractei The Senator calculates much upon the
moial influence which his amendment might exert
What, su' a mo al influence ovei a banking cor-
poration m o, pusition to its interest' I \ eniui e to
say, that no such agency as this can prove effectu-
al It is pow ei alone which can produce this re-
sult And wnerc does this power exist? No where,
but m the Slate Legislatuies It 's doubrtil, how-
ever, cxtremUv doubtinl, wheht-r the) tan ever
be induced to exeit it It is most difficult to tiulc
twentj-six independent sovereignties, having d f-
Jerent and ever-varying feelings and interests, in
anj such uniform system of policy, and especially
against the opposition of the local banks During
the last session, I had prepared an amendment to
the Constitution, (and had it in my desk for a long
ame,) conferímg upon Congress the powei of pio-
hibumg ihe cnculation of bank notes under twenty
lollars, but declined offering it, because I then
deemed it a hopeless attempt Circumstances have
no v v i v much changed, and s nee the Senator
fiim Ki nlucky (Mi Cutteuden) has so strongly
alv caled su n an ameulmetit, I feel some cmfl-
denc- tt>l i woikl meel with a U\orable recep-
tion fioin th" S ates Should I ooocludi o o tie it
at the next ' sioi , I shall count largely on his
able ard cfhcmit support, or, if he shou d prefer
to take the lead lupiself, I shall lender him all the
ass stmce m mv power
