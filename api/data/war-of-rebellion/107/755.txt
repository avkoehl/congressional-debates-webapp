Colonel G. D. RUGGLES,

General Pope's Headquarters, Rappahannock:

SIR: I have directed Colonel Pierce, at Manassas, to send forward and guard the road strongly from Catlett's to Manassas, and to arrest all stragglers from your army. The railroad is now monopolized by Heintzelman's division, so that it is impossible to send any from here. I think some of them will be off soon, and that may attain the end desired, but I willsend him your telegram.
