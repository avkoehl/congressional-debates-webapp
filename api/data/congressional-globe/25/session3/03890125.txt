stake, to convict 01 acquit any man' Without
such a committee, yor-r investigation will be a
mcie fatce, and all will consider it a mere mock-
ery of justice, and a mere hunt after party cal-
umny and detraction, not to "whitewash," but to
"blaclwash" the individuals and the party to
whom a majoiuy of that committee is opposed
Can aiythmg be more apparent' If we would
have an eye singly fixed upon the public interests,
with a view to investigate this transaction for the
benefit of the country, and the counti y alone, the
composition of this committee should be made of
the most impartial, unprejudiced, and unexcep-
tionable materials Sn, I wain those who now,
for the first time, have gained the power m this
House by the aid of the "sectet ballot," not to
commit in open day, in the face of the world, that
hideous, damning, and blackest of crimes, of se-
lecting a committee themselves, composed of a
majority of their own friends—a thing that they
have consumed so much of the important time of
this House in denouncing and stigmatizing as a
species of favoritism, co rruption, and prostitu tion,
piegnant with a degree of partiality and injustice
that defied all scrutiny into the malpractices of
this Government. I charge them, in the face of
this House, in the face of this countiy, not to let
then first act, after obtaining power, be imbued
with all the cumeand odium which they have so
eloquently attached to it when committed by the
Republican party m this House I charge them,
if they have yet left one sentiment of lespect for
the intelligence and good sense of the people of
this country, not to let their first act be guilty,
and convict them of this black and damning sm,
about which they have been so clamorous, and
which it has been their daily vocation, since the
organization of their party, to hold up and de-
nounce as an act of most crying injustice, and
monstrous corruption I chaigc them not to treat
with such disrespect the good sense and recollec-
tion of the people of this country
I charge them not to let this people demand of
them to know why it is a virtue in one party in
this country to commit an act which it is prosti-
tution, corruption, and profligacy, when com-
mitted by another; why it is that individuals or
parties appear before them, and denounce that in
others which they applaud, as the highest praise,
the commission of by themselves And I charge
gentlemen, in the name of our common country,
m the name of that liberty which we all profess
so much to love, not to presume too much upon
their power of misi epresentation and stultification
of the honest, intelligent, and unbiased freemen
of my country
Of all the parties that have heretofore existed
in this country, that of the Whig, now so called,
should be the last to resist and refuse the appoint-
ment, in this House, of a liberal and impartial
committee to investigate any subject, and more
particulaily the piesent The least variation from
the strictest impartiality, and the greatest liber-
ality, is at war with every profession and declai-
ation that they have made for yeais, both in and
out of this House. Sir, with them to piesume
the contrary, consistency would cease to be a vir-
tue, and sincerity of profession a damnable hete-
rodox. But how shall this party appear' How
shall the world judge them, when it is made evi-
dent, that the very first act committed by them,
after acquiring powei, I say, will be found in op-
position to all that they have said and written on
this subject ever since the constitution of this
mongrel party ? What shall the woi Id say when
their very first act is made to give the—1 will not
say what, but will call it by a milder name—the
most palpable contradiction, and open falsifica-
tion, of every profession of sincerity that they
have heretofore, with such prodigality, made to
the American people.
Now, sir, let facts speak toan impaitial and in-
telligent world; and I invoke all attention, that
nothing may be lost, that justice may amply be
done to all whom it may concern. Here are íes-
olunons adopted to raise'a committee of nine mem-
bers to effect an investigation of a transaction,
deeply imbued with fraud, as it is alleged, and in
which not only your Secretary of the Treasury,
but the whole character of this Administration, is
involved
This charge has been again and again made,
and repeated upon this floor; the charge has been
met, and all are willing to go into the investiga-
tion, and to ferret out what of fraud and corrup-
tion it is in the power of the committee in good
faith to effect. I have before said that the Ad-
ministration party, or Republican paity, repre-
senting a majority of the people of this countiy,
have at least a majority of some fifteen 01 twenty-
five of the Representatives of this body, including
the Conservatives, all of whom, he believed, had
been elected as friends to this Administration
Yet strange to tell, already,by -virtue of the "se-
cret ballot," had there been elected on fits com-
mittee, Messrs Curtis, Harlan, Wist-, Dawson,
Smith, and Hopkins, foui Whigs, two Conserv-
ative, all of whom,] udgmg from their course here,
aie as deadly hostile to all that is connected with
this Administration as they are to the monarchy
of Great Bntain Now, sn, the Whig party,
" all told," have, on this floor, from one hundred
and five to one hundred and ten Representatives of
the two hundred and forty-two. The Republicans
have from one hundred and twelve to one hundred
and eighteen. The Conservatives have ten to
twelve Representatives in this House,justenough
to give the Whigs a small majority, whenever it
becomes their interest to do so. Here is the true
position of parties, and what is the aspect before
us ' Let the country note it. Already have the
Whigs, who comprise both a minority of the
Representatives of this House, and a minority of
the people of this country, taken care of them-
selves, and wrested the power from the majority,
both in the House and out of it, and placed on
the committee four of the nine of their own mem-
bers, and for services rendered, gave to the Con-
servatives two already of the nine to íepresent
their ten or twelve on this floor, one of whom,
however, is as much of a Whig, and as deadly
hostile to the Administration, as any member of
the Whig party in or out of this House, thus se-
curing to themselves, by thealliance, a dead ma-
jority on the committee, although representing
both a minority in the House and out of it.
Now all this is no paitiakty, gentlemen, nothing
like it, and though you repiesent but a minority
of the people of this country, and the majority of
the committee represent the minority of this
House, I give you the greatest credit for your in-
genuity, your tact, and your management, you
deserve most richly a better cause
But, Mr Speaker, in all good conscience, what
will the world say in all future time of the frank-
ness and sincerity of the professions and purity
of a party who, by then first act, after obtaining
power, have committed the very despicable crime
that they have so long been wont to charge home
upon their opponents, of being of the deepest dye,
and fraught with every species of corruption that
was alaiming and appalling to the rights of fiee
men ' What will they say at the display of such
tact, management, and ingenuity, at the expense
of every profession of sincerity and political hon-
esty ' How will the world regard their clamoi,
in all time to come, about partiality, tuck, strat-
agem, and intrigue ' What have they done in re-
gard to this committee but the very thing that
they have so long denounced you, Mr Speaker,
and the whole Republican paity, foi doing' Sir,
did I say it was the very thing for which they
denounced you and the Republican party ' I beg
pardon, I will show it to be infinitely worse—yes,
sir, worse—and which, sn, will place your con-
duct in that chair in a most enviable light. Can
they possibly think that we do not see the covert
objects of this Janus-faced movement for an elec-
tion by secret ballot' Do they think that their
craft can forever protect and shield them from de-
tection and exposure' Do they think that the
people are so blind and stupid as not to see thi ough
their double object in wresting from the Speaker
of the House the power of appointment of a com-
mittee at this time' Do they think that we are
not aware of the reflection upon both the integ-
rity and capacity of the majority of this House,
who have placed you, sir, in that seat' And do
they suppose that we are not aware of another,
and a still greater object, that this put ityparty have
m view by this very reflection, and which is at
the bottom of much of this movement' Is it, sn,
to affect you'in a certain State, before whose
Democratic Republican freemen your name is
now held up for a most piotmnent station ' Is it
expected, by such hoco poco, crafthood movements
here, that the Republican freemen of that distin-
guished State are to be duped and hoodwinked
and led up to the sacrifice and immolation of one
of her own sons, who has distinguished himself
so much in his advocacy of the agí ¡cultural,
planting, and pioductive interests of the State,
against the unproductive, impoverishing, monop-
olies thathave everywhere so maued and blighted
the piospenty of our country' Let me entreat
them to respect more the intelligence, sagacity,
and practical understanding of the faraieis, and
i the productive, laboring men of my country.
i Your enemies have in this done you an act of
I justice that must exalt you far beyond anything
i that your friends could have done for you They
have shown, after all the hue and cry set up
against you, and the unmeasured tirade of abuse
which they have leveled against you, that they,
they, sir, by their first act after obtaining power,
have sanctioned your conduct to the fullest ex-
tent; nay, more, they have gone far beyond it.
You gave to the majority of the Representatives
in this House, and, consequently, a majority of
the people of the country, only a majority on the
several important committees, in conformity with
every republican usage and practice since the or-
ganization of constitutional governments that had
for its basis the control of a majority of the peo-
ple. This was your crime, and was the corrupt-
ing crime of the party to which you belonged, and
for which you have been daily threatened, on this
floor, with a political guillotine. But what have
your enemies done ' They have taken it upon
themselves, not to place on a committee a major-
ity to represent a majority of the members of this
House, not a majority to represent a majority of
the people of this country, but, worse than all,
they have placed on the committee a majority of
those who represent both a mmoi ity on this floor,
and a minority of the people of this country, and
by this means have given the Representatives of
a minority, both of the people and Representa-
tives in this House, the power to try and con-
demn, in the committee, the majority, a thing
perfectly anomalous in all free governments, in-
consistent with eveiy principle of Democratic re-
publicanism, as abhorrent with every doctrine of
equality and common justice; and one which, if
it had been committed by any Speaker of the Re-
publican or Democratic party, would have been
rung, trwnpet-tongued, through every cabin, shan-
ty, village, and hamlet beyond the mountains.
What a wonderful regard is here shown for the
opinions, the feelmgs,and the interests of the ma-
jority of the freemen of this country in the very
first act of a party after obtaining power' Whai
a commentary does it not furnish to their future
course, should they retain the power that they
have seized on by this " holy alliance;" a power
not given by a majority of the people, nor even
contemplated to have been given, but which they
have obtained by a coalition, in defiance of the
will or wishes of that people as expressed through
then Representatives
But, Mr. Speaker, this is far from being all;
the worst is to come yet. I believe it has been
customary in this House, since I have been hon-
ored with a seat on this floor, when important
committees were to be appointed, for the Speaker
to receive suggestions and recommendations of
particular gentlemen, fiom both paities m this
House, of such gentlemen as they desired to be
placed on such committees, and such suggestions
have at all times received the most favorable con-
sideration and I do not know of a single instance
where the present Speakei or his predecessors
have not yielded to such suggestions In the ap-
pointment of all oui important committees, by
both our presentand former Speakers, each party
has been generally represented by its ablest mem-
bers This, in all fairness, is all that we now
ask. Will this new coalition of Whigs and Con-
servatives, now the majority of this House, dare
to disturb this salutary usage, and, for the first
time,depart fiomits long acquiesced in propriety,
fiom which I ha\e heard as yet not of a single
act of deviation' This, however, has not been
considered by the Whig party liberal enough for
them, their complaints have continued unceas-
ingly, until they have gamed power by aid of the
