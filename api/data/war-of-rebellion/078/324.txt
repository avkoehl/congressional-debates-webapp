C. H. POTTER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., August 30, 1864.

(Received 1. 40 p. m.)

A. LINCOLN,

President:

My connection with the State militia having drawn my attention specially to the subject of our border defenses, I trust I may be pardoned for suggesting one or two matters of pressing necessity. The country between the Cumberland and Green Rivers, the resort of guerrillas, ought to be attached to the District of Indiana, and the commander of that district made independent of General Heintzelman. These two things, with an officer of General Hovey's energy and ability in charge, will enable [us] to defend the border of Indiana on the Kentucky side, check up the guerrillas bands, and insure large Government supplies to be drawn from the district residents who harbor the guerrillas. I have been on the ground and speak advisedly.

JAS. HUGHES.
