Report of Major General James B. McPherson, U. S. Army, commanding Army of the Tennessee.

HUNTSVILLE, ALA.,

April 30, 1864.

The enemy appeared before Decatur this morning with quiet a force, and opened on the place with four pieces of artillery, A brigade went out and drove them off. Colonel Phillips is following them. We lost a few men killed and wounded. The object of the enemy was doubtless to feel our position. The attack will not delay Dodge's movement.
