HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 12, 1864 - 1.30 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I have already telegraphed General Humphreys that I wish you to close in on General Wright and cover his right and send a division, Cutler's to Wright, and Griffin's to Hancock. I have sent Major Duane to examine General Wright's position and the ground to cover his flank and to communicate with Humphreys and yourself.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 12, 1864.

General MEADE:

I have about got General Cutler's division clear of my line, and twenty minutes ago the head of the line began marching to the left. I shall send General Cutler's whole division. There is some little delay in getting the forces together after the assault.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

May 12, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

I have sent [all] of General Cutler's division, and am still holding a threatening attitude to the enemy's line here. It may be of no use to hold this line, and if you want it abandoned, and all move down to the left, I can soon do so, as I now have everything in hand. General Humphreys went to find something more definite about what should be done. Shall I move, with the rest of my force, away from here, leaving only a small force to watch the right, or wait further developments?

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

TALLEY'S HOUSE, May 12, 1864 - 3.10 p. m.

Captain A. S. MARVIN, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: In relation to the battery opposite this place, previously reported to you, I have further to report that the enemy appear to be throwing up earth-works in front of their guns. The spot is the same as that yesterday shelled from this place by Colonel Tidball. The battery in question may be intended either to enfilade our lines or to command the positions now held by the enemy, in case of assault by us.

I remain, &amp;c.,

C. F. ADAMS, Jr.,

Captain, &c.
