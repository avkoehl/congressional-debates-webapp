TWO MILES FROM CROSS-ROADS TOWARD LIVINGSTON, October 17, 1863.

GENERAL: The enemy are pressing me sorely this morning. I have no doubt they are making for Canton. A rapid concentration of infantry at Canton is very desirable.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier General A. BUFORD,

Commanding, Canton.

THREE MILES FROM LIVINGSTON, October 17, [1863]-1.30 p. m.

GENERAL: The enemy are still pursuing. Have driven me 3 miles since 7 a. m. Their cavalry has been endeavoring to get in my rear and cut me off. Enemy advancing on Livingston and Brownsville road; also pushing Colonel Adams, commanding Cosby's brigade, on Madisonville road. Scouts report infantry, cavalry, and artillery crossing at Scott's Ferry. This is doubtful. I have sent to ascertain more definitely. I will keep you fully advised of all moves, and will give you all the time you require to get your force together. Enemy's force consists of six brigades (two divisions, Generals Tuttle and Logan commanding, McPherson reported to be in command of all), and three regiments cavalry; usual proportion of artillery. All the roads to Canton will be well picketed, and commanding officers ordered to report to you. Say to General Buford that I received his dispatch of 11.30 a. m. Had a handsome fight with them yesterday. They are more cautious to-day.

With high respect, general, your obedient servant,

W. H. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General.
