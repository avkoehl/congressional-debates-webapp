HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Rolla, Mo., April 25, 1863.

General VANDEVER;

I sent the infantry regiments of your division to Pilot Knob yesterday, to operate as Second Division, Army of the Frontier. I have scouts out to watch the bridges on Southwest Branch, Pacific road. Keep me posted. The probability is that I will move from there to Pilot Knob with balance of command, and take your transportation with me. We are reducing baggage and issuing shelter tents. Nothing new from Southwest.

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, Mo., April 25, 1863.

General VANDEVER;

Dispatch* received. Exercise your own discretion. Bleed the enemy, if you can, and punish his impudence.

N. P. CHIPMAN,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, ARMY OF THE FRONTIER,Jackson, Mo., April 27, 1863.

Brigadier General JOHN MCNEIL:

General Vandever directs me to inform you that he is in pursuit of the fleeing enemy on the Bloomfield road, under the belief that they were escaping, via Dallas. Last night he attacked a camp of them 2 1\2 miles west of here, ordering the First Iowa, under Major [Joseph W.] Caldwell, to charge them with saber and pistol. This was gallantly done by moonlight, and was entirely successful. Our prisoners number some 40 already, and more are being brought in. A large quantity of horses, saddles, and arms were secured.

The cannonading at the Cape yesterday was heard by our advance about noon yesterday, and under its influence we traveled yesterday 40 miles. Can you, by moving out on Bloomfield road, cut retreat?

Very respectfully,

LUCIEN J. BARNES,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., April 30, 1863.

Brigadier General WILLIAM VANDEVER,

Bloomfield, Mo.:

GENERAL: I have just seen yours of the 28th to General Davidson, asking for your transportation and saying you will occupy Bloomfield. There is nothing to be gained by an occupation of Bloomfield. If the rebels have got out of your reach, you will immediately fall back to Pilot Knob or Gape Girardeau, whichever is most convenient. I would rather you would be at Pilot Knob, where you can report to General Herron, and immediately to this place, with a view to completely repairing all damage arising from your recent hard and very successful campaign.
