This order must be read to each company of each regiment, and that immediately.

By order of Brigadier General W. T. Sherman:

J. H. HAMMOND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

FORT HENRY, March 14, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

The first word received from General Smith to-day. He has debarked at Savannah. Sent me no report, but his landing there would indicate fortifications and the enemy in force above.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

FORT HENRY, March 14, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Report and field return from General Smith just received. A battery of a dozen pieces or more found at Eastport. The general thinks Corinth will have to be let alone for the present, but will learn more and report probably by next steamer. An expedition is organizing from Pittsburg in the direction of Corinth, but east of it.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT WEST TENNESSEE,Fort Henry, March 14, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

I have been waiting for reports of sub-commanders at the battle of Fort Donelson to make some recommendations of officers for advancement for meritorious services. These reports are not yet in, and as the troops under my command are actively engaged, may not be for some time. I therefore take this occasion to make some recommendations of officers who in my opinion should not be neglected. I would particularly mention the names of Colonel J. D. Webster, First Illinois Artillery ; Morgan L. Smith, Eighth Missouri Volunteers; W. H. L. Wallace, Eleventh Illinois Volunteers, and John A. Logan, Thirty-first Illinois Volunteers. The two former are old soldiers and men of decided merit. The two latter are from civil pursuits, but I have no hesitation in fully indorsing them as in every way qualified for the position of brigadier-general, and think they have fully earned the position on the field of battle. There are others who may be equally meritorious, but I do not happen to know so well their services.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
