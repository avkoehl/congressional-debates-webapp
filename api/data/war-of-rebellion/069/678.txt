Major-General HUMPHREYS:

There are no changes discernible in the enemy's force or position in my front. In front of the left division some progress was made in opening and improving advanced works, and connecting them with the rear. Positions for two additional guns were prepared. In front of the center an advanced line was opened, which is now being strengthened and connected with the rear. In front of the right nothing was done but to finish works already commenced, and nearly completed a new battery.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

GENERAL: I will send you one of your batteries at once. My own three batteries are so close to the enemy that it is absolutely necessary to relieve them that the men and horses may have some rest. If you still desire it, I will send your other one to you. Mine ar in good position, and do good service to both our corps.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. F. SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.
