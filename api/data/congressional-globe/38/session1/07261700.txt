THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 18,
of the House at that time was my colleague from
the fifth district, [Mr. Pike,] and one ot the dis-
tinguished ^Senators from that Stale [Mr. Mor-
rill] was President of the Senate. I am not
awme that the powet has been questioned of one
Smie anting-a charier for built)tug railroads out-
side of lis territories, subject, of course, to the
consent of any other State whose territory was to
be crossed. In the exercise of this power the
Legislature of New York granted a chatter to a
company for the construction of a road across the
Isthmus of Panama, and another time, 1 believe,
for a road in Texas. The objection to Congress
granting power for such purposes to Fedeial
agents, which existed yeais ago, seems not to
have prevailed in 1862, when the act chartering
tfie Centra! Pacific load was passed,and I am not
disposed to urge now that there is any soundness
in such an objection; but 1 do not perceive any
good reason why Congress may not legislate in
aid oft* company chartered by a State winch would
not apply with at least equal force to giving power
directly to Government agents for tiie same pur-
Thc only other interest which Maine has in this
project is that which an enlightened public senti-
ment on this subject will create everywhere; an
interest created by her bold but successful ex-
periment in the Atlantic and St. Lawrence rail-
road, making Portland the terminus of the longest
continuous railway in the woild; an interest
founded on the growth and increased commerce
of Portland and othei pails of the State, occa-
sioned undoubtedly by that road. In illustiation
ofihist may be pardoned fin stating thaun 1849,
previous to the opening of this i oad, tin; ex pot to
from that place wem only $G43,5;2t); and in ]bG3,
with the road completed to Canada and tin-nee to
Detroit, th< v amounted to $5,018,3(15. The im-
ports in 1849 were *>498,346,ami in lb63 I hey had
juictertsrd to ^9,034,5^(5, including that which
passed thiough under bond to the Cumulus.
Again I say, as an additional leason why
Maine is interested, morcot'her sons and daugh-
ters, m proportion to her population, than irom
any other Suite, have emigrated mi lie .Nor ill w  it,

Uiey have learm d from personal expeiience and
obsei vation, to lend them our aid in cat <ying on
this national work. Is tins road practicable?
is it important? are questions winch we ate
called upon first to answer. Tim one already
chartered is claimed to be both piacucublo and

judgment, no other loute possesses. Tire dis-
tance is less, expense of bniUling less, and i>ieafcr
public interests will be snbsnvtd by this than
by any other communication with the Pacific.
These points 1 propose to establish.

"Thus," as Mr. Stevens says, " every seatof
eoEtjmerce on the coast is nearer to Puget sound
by the Northern route than to the waters of San
Francisco by the Central route."
in relation to obstructions from the enow and
severity of the climate, it is too well settled to re-
quire discussion that nothing need he feared from
either of these causes; but as I have recently heard
some question made upon this point by a gentle-
man on this floor, who said he "had not had an
opportunity to examine the subject. 1 will quote
from the reports of Stevens and Mullan,and trust
it will be sufficient to remove any further doubt.
Mr. Stevens says:
" In an examination of that country, which T made in
the years 1853-54-55, i deemed it a fundamental and essen-
tia! tact to l e determined, and tt was deter inured rn a man-
ner that will enable me to .-[leak positively. The passes
ot the iloeky mountains, Hell Gate, Northern Little Black-
toot, and Cadotte's pass weie crowed by my parties in the
months of December, Janiimy, Ft binary, and March, in the
year? lt-53-54, and in no one of these passes did tirey find
more than tii'lyen niches ot snow."
I could quote at length from all those who have
surveyed tins route and show conclusively that
there can be no difficulty ftom snow, but there is
not time for this. I have the authorities before
me and will show them to any gentleman who
desires it.
Again, he says:
t; [ will now consider the question of the cold. It is al-
leged that the weather is ^o eoiu on the route of t « forty-
seventh pcu.Ulel that it will be nnpinctieable to woik men

The festimony of Mr. Muilan is the same; but
I can only icferyou to his very able report for
the dermis.  .
Upon examination of the report of Mr. Col-
lins, our consul at the A moor, m ]b57-;>3, you
will find tins supposed practical difficulty of
snow and cold fully answered in ht.s detailed state-
ment of the postal service, or system of " post-
ing" in Russia. Surrounded constantly by these
ditficultiog, they have met them boldly and found
that their existence even was oniym theory. Dif-
ficulties, like dangers, 01 dm.inly U-pspd in propor-
tion. as tisey are approached, and there is no better
illustration of this, in a material point, than is
found in the practicability of traversing that vast
extent of territory between Moscow ami Irkoutsk
in eastern Siberia, of three thousand four hundred
*nd twenty-six miles, where the cold and snow
are much more troublesome than over any por-
tion of the Northern route to the Pacific. This
immense distance is traveled in Russia in twenty-
five to thirty days by the ordinary conveyance,
and on special occasions for Government pur-
poses it is accomplished in fifteen to twenty days.
Says Mr. Collins:
c< One of the mos-t singular features in this route from
Moscow, such an immense distance over such an im-
mense waste of country, is the fact that it occurs less than
half a dozen times that the change of horses does not take
placc in a crty, town, or vilUgu. I have no hesitation in
saving that I passed through rive hundred cities, towns, and
villages."
Let it be borne m mmd thatall this country thus
described by Mr. Collins lies between the paral-
lels of 52°and 58°, and that the mercury, over a
greater portion of it during the winter, is below
zero*, while on the proposed route to the Pacific
the most northerly latitude probably will not be
higherthan 470, and in my judgment will notvary
much fiom the average of the forty-sixth degree
if the bestone is adopted.
I well recollect the doubts that were entertained
when the Atlantic and St. Lawrence railroad was
first under discussion, as to the practicability of
running the cars regularly in the "winter; butthese
doubts, though apparently founded on what were
then considered sufficient data by the opponents
of the undertaking, controlled not in the least
those who had determined to complete the road
and prove by actual trial that these doubts were
unfounded. The road was finished, and there has
been less irregularity and detention on it caused
by snow than on any other road leading into
Portland. It is on the seaboard of our eastern
States that you may expect more difficulties from
snow than anywhere else, fur there it falls,damp
and heavy, and by freezing on the rail is sure to
cause frequent delays, while m higher latitudes
the snow tails lighter, and no one fall being heavy,
there is no difficulty ordinarily m running through
it and sweeping it away, with a powerful engine.
Actual experiment has demonstrated this, over the
whole distance of the Atlantic and St. Lawrence
and the Gtand Trunk railways. The greatest
detention by snow that I have ever personally
known was on the Boston and Maine railroad,
at Ipswich, Massachusetts, when the downward
tunn was kept more than twenty-four hours by
the drifting of damp snow, while the branch line,
not many miles in the interior, on the same day,
was not obstructed at all.
In view of all the testimony on this point, with
the many actual experiments already made, there
can be no longer doubt that so far as relates to
snow and seventy of climate, this road to the
Pacific is entirely practicable.
Another difficulty has been suggested, and that
is, that on this route there must be many miles
of vuy expensive tunneling. This is another
great mistake which some have fallen into. By
one of the routes surveyed by Mr. Stevens it is
true that a very consuieiable amount of this work
would be required, but this can easily be avoided
by crossing another pass in the mountains, in-
ci easing the distance some two hundred and fifty
miles. Upon this I prefer to give you the lan-
guage of Mr. Stevens, as taken from Ins report,
which is confumed by Mr. Muilan:
" It is objected io the Northern route that it involves cx-
ten^ivu tumi'-lnitf. Tim is not necessarily the ea^e. Tiio
Northern toad can bi; located \\ ith little or no tunneling, but
at a very gieut mciea^e o{ distance.
