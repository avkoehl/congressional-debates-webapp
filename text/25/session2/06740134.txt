It is true, sir, most of them are poor, but I trust
and believe they are honest I know them io be
honorable, peaceable, law-abiding citizens, who
would scorn a dishonorable action as much as the
Senator himself.   I am personally acquainted with
many oi mem they ate educated, moral, and highly
respectable Many of them would lose nothing by
a comparison with members on this floor, and if the
honorable Senator holds a different opinion, it is
because he has been lmsinlermed Those who
communicated with the honorable Senatoi on this
subject, should have given him anothei piece of in-
founation that might possibly be ol service lo him
in a coming daj. They should have informed

amm-  it He tells us that his object is to prohibit
mtliviJual pre-«mptions on th" lands lately pur-
chased from the Miamies     If his amendment be
adopted, it will make an invidious distinction be-
tween our own constituents and the citizens oí other
new States of the West, and he calls oa mt to give
a vete which would appear to deprive them of a
puvilege which this bill secures toothers. I do
not wish to be understood as expressing an opinion
that a pre-emption right, under the provisions of
this bill, can vestm the lands lately acquired from
the Miami Indians. The amendment offered by
the Senatoi from Tennessee, (Mr. Wmrs) for
which I most cheerfully voted, prohibits the grant-
ing of pre emptions to any person who settled upon
the lands before the Indian title had been extin-
guished, When all the facts about this Miami
treaty aie properly understood, it seems to me they
should quiet 'he fears of every one who opposes
the granting of individual pre emption rights to any
pot Hon of that valuable tiact of land Although
this tteaty was entered into in 18'!4, it was
not ratified by the Senate untd October last.
By the resolution of ratification, it was di-
lected to be submitted to the Indians for their
assent to ceitam alteiattons made on the part of
the United States. It was accordingly submitted,
and the assent of the Indians obtained in Novem-
ber, but will my colleague say that the cession was
complete, and the title of the United States to the
land pel feet, before the promulgation of the treaty
by Executive? proclamation'2 This publication was
not made until the 22d oí December I ask, then,
how can a pre-emption light be established to
lands ceded by this Miami Heaty, when the bill
under which they are to be claimed piovides that
the settler shall have been in actual occupation of
Ihe land on the 1st of Decembei last, near a month
before the promulgation oí the treaty which com-
pleted the title oi the United States to the land in
question? On the 1st of December last the land was
Indian land, and theamendmentof the Senator irom
Ti nnessee (Mr Whiti) expressly pi mibits the ex-
tension of this right to individuals settled upon such
land beloie the Indian title had been extinguished.
I hope the joint resolution will pass our Legislature,
and be sent on here instructing us to make an ap-
peal to the liberality of the Senate, to grant to the
State a pre-emption right to these lands at the
minimum price. We will then have an oppor-
tunity of testing the sincerity of those who oppose
individual pre-emptions, and have told us that they
would greatly prefer granting it to the State in aid
of her public words, to granting it to squatters on
the public lands It will afford me great pleasure
to exert my feeble abihues in (ui warding the
wishes of our State, but 1 greatly fear wo will be
left m a lean minority My colleage tells us he
would voie against an individual pre-emption right,
as an original proposition, that if he votes tor it now,
it will be because it has become the settled
policy ol the country I view the matter m a dil-
le rent light Nothing can afford mo more satis-
fiptio  than to vote the most valuable public land
owned by *he Government to a poor, but honest
pioneer, who seeks a home in the western woods
Those who, at this day, emigrate from the old to
the new States, art gen-rally irom the rarms,
workshops, schools, or colleges, in the Kut, who
make citi/ens o1 gieat n oral worth, and who would
grace any sociPty, arid I ask, how can a mau
whose bosom glows with patriotic devotion to his
country, deny to the prcent settlers on th« public
lands the privileges enjoyed by others for more
than a quarter of a century'!    \ Cann t   I will not
Ihe Senator from Kentucky (Mr Clay) says
there is no equality in the pre-emption system , that
it produces dissatisfaction, by going befoie the sur-
vey and seizing upon the choice spots 1 admit
that it produces d ssatisfaction m two classes of
individual-.—one, the politician in die o'd States,
who is loth to give up the poor but industrious
portion c f their population , and the other Ihe capi-
talists, who are anxious to get possession of these
choice spots, and who, by attending the public
sales and overbidding the poor i i ui, compel him
to retire, and content himseli with land of an
inferior quality They are dissatisfied, but not
wronged
My colleague complain  that politics have been
diagged into this debate. He admits that there are
those who will be influenced by political considera-
