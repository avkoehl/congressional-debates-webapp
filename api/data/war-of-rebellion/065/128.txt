HEADQUARTERS ARMY C. S., September 3, 1864.

Respectfully returned to honorable Secretary of War.

The policy of keeping ourselves at all times ready to meet the greatest efforts the enemy might make is a very safe one, and were it practicable should be adopted, but without the means the question need not be discussed. When the enemy withdraws his forces from Virginia to attack Charleston, ours now confronting him may be sent to meet him on his new field, but in the mean time I can see nothing but evil in the course advised.

BRAXTON BRAGG,General.

[Fourth indorsement.]

SEPTEMBER 4, 1864.
