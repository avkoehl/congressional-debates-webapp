Colonel GEORGE WRIGHT:

Come here immediately; by stage if quiecker than by boat. I leave for Washington in the next steamer. Denver is to relieve you, and you then go East. Order Carleton by express to send three companies to Fort Yuma and return with the rest. Concentrate all the regulars at San Pedro and San Diego.

COLD SPRING HOUSE, October 13, 1861.

COMMANDING OFFICER AT FORT WALLA WALLA:

SIR: Some days ago a number of men came here saying there were over 100 men mining on Salmon River, and were in want of provisions, and that they had viewed out a good trail as they came out. The consequence was that three trains started for that place, one yesterday and two the day before. Not knowing that any hostility existed, seven of us started to overtake the pack trains this morning. When we had proceeded some seven or eight miles, and when near Eagle-of-the-Light's camp, he and two other Indians placed themselves in the trail before us, and said if we went any further that their men were in the woods close by and were ready for us, and that we must either go back or be killed. Eagle-of-the-Light spoke of Lawyer and others of the Nex Perces as being fools and were blind, but he could see, and that he would join the Snakes, and, being united, they would wipe out all the whites who were in their country, or who attempted to go through it. Now, unless those men who are on Salmon River get assistance soon they are in imminent danger of starving or of being massacred by the Indians. The miners in this vicinity are very poorly armed. In consequence of this, and the great need of immediate and prompt action, we would respectfully solicit your aid.

Colonel EDWARD D. TOWNSEND,

Asst. Adjt. General, Hdqrs. of the Army, Washington, D. C.:

Order of the 16th ultimo just received. I leave in the next steamer, on the 21st instant, with the Third Artillery, part of the Sixth Infantry, and 10,000 muskets. What disposition shall be made of the general staff officers? Colonel Wright ought to remain here in command. The safety of the whole coast may depend upon it.
