GENERAL: I inclose a report just received from General Fitz. Lee. The pickets in front of Shady Grove, on the Catharpin road, report the same movement. Enemy had also late in the afternoon retired their cavalry from my front toward Todd's Tavern. Rosser's loss to-day is about 120 killed and wounded; among the latter, Colonel Funsten, Eleventh Virginia Cavalry, slightly.

HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVLARY DIVISION,May 6, 1864-Dusk.

[General J. E. B. STUART:]

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 3.30 p. m. just received. The enemy are now retiring from my front on the Catharpin road in the direction of Chancellorsville. In case the enemy retreat across the Rapidan, would it not we well for me to cross below them and get on their flank? It is now too dark for me to push the enemy, so I remain still and keep my horses fresh. I am very well off for rations and forage, and will be to-night on the road between Todd's Tavern and Spotsylvania Court-House. Let me hear from you as soon as possible.

Very respectfully,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General.
