Major-General PLEASONTON:

GENERAL: It is so foggy that it is hard to discover anything. There seems to be but a few cavalrymen between here and Downsville. At or near Downsville is a division of Longstreet, entrenching themselves. Their line is on a height just this side of Downsville. It extends south toward the river, in a very rugged country, with many stone walls parallel to their front.
