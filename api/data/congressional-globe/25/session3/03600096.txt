AFPSN0IX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

this can be best done by favoring their peculiar
views and policy in reference to the public lands.
. Wow, one of two things must folio*: either all the
candidates will enter mto this competition,in which
case the struggle will be who shall-go furthest, and
its consequence to give the vote to him who may
bid highest. It is easy to see how this would end.
The public domain, the noble inheritance of the
people of this Union, would be squandered, or
rather gambled away, in the contest, and would
thus be made, at the same time, the means of
plundei and corruption, and of elevating to power
the most profligate and audacious
But if, instead of all the candidates seeking the
favor-of the new States, a part should court their
interests, and the others that of the old States, the
tram of events would, indeed, be varied, but the
fBltimate result would be the same. On this sup-
position each of the candidates would resort to
means best calculated to secure the section on
whose support he might rely. Those looking to
the new States would push to the extreme the
favorite policy of those States in reference to the
public lands, while the others would take the op-
posite extreme in favor of the old States Now,
when we reflect that the new and the old States
must necessarily, from their different position and
relation to the public lands, entertain very differ-
ent views of the policy that ought to be pursued
in relation to them, in almost every point—so
twueh so, that the one shall consider that but as
the demands of justice which the other shall regard
as nothing short of open plunder, as we have wit-
nessed in this discussion—we may form some
conception of the violence of the conflict which
must ensue in the case supposed. We have had,
even in this early stage, and on this very ques-
tion, some indications of what we may expect.
The most violent animosity and hatred would fol-
low, and *very man, be his motives ever so pure
and patriotic, would be regarded the friend or the
swemy of the new or the old States, as his opin-
ions favored the policy of the one or the other
The final termination of the conflict would not be
áoubtful. Whatever turns of fortune might occur
m its progress, the new States must, in the end,
prevail Their lelative increase is fai more rapid
than the old; so much so, that after 1850—that is,
after the third presidential election from the next J
—they would be left, as I have shown, the undis- i
puted possession of the field In the mean time,
while the struggle is goirg on, the animosity would
daily increase on both sides The longer it con-
tinued the more bitter it would become, and the
more certainly and completely would the present
system be overthrown, if, indeed, the Union itself
should be strong enough to withstwd the shock
Such must inevitably be the fate of the present
system, should we have the folly, I might say the
madness, to attempt to continue it as it is, so far
as the new States are concerned, regardless of the
great changes w ich have already taken place,
and the still more mighty m progress
Having now pointed out the danger, { turn next
to the deeply important question of remedy, which
demands the most prompt and solemn considera
tion, both of the Government and the community
The question is, what means shall we adopt to
avert the mischief which 1 have shown to be so
rapidly approaching, and which must inevitably
soon arrive, if not prevented by some speedy and
efficient measure' Already onehasbeen pioposed, ¡

Treasury of us burden, but which its author (the
Senator from Kentucky, Mr. Clay) has renewed
oti the present occasion, doubtless with the view, )
in part, at least, to meet the growing disorders of
the system     His proposition is to divide the pro
ceeds of the public lands among the States, with
the double view, Í suppose, to a more equal parti-
cipation in the advantages of the public domain by I
the members of the Union, and to preserve the I
present system by a more vigilant guardianship of '
the States    I do not now intend to discuss the
merits of this measure    My object is simply to
state, in general terms, my opinion m relation to
it, without entering into the reasons on which it is
grounded.
There appears, then, to me, to be great and de
eisive objections to the measure The right to
adopt it may, in the first place, be fairly ques-

tinned. We hold the public domain as a common
property or fund, belonging to the States of the
Union in their confederated, and not in their in-
dividual character. They were acquired either by
purchase out of common funds belonging to the
Union, or by cession from the States to the Union,
to be held as a fund m common, and I am at a loss
to conceive what right we have to make that which
belongs to the whole Union a3 a common fund,
the separate fund of each State. It seems to me
that it cannot be done without a manifest breach
of trust and a violation of the Constitution. This
is no new opinion, formed for the occasion. It
was, on the contrary, formed when its author first
introduced the measure, and when he and myself
thought alike as to the necessity of relieving the
Treasury of us surplus, in order fo avoid the dif-
ficulties and the dangers which have smcefollowed.
Believing, then, that it would be effectual for that
purpose, and more easily adopted than any other,
I examined it with an inclination to embrace it as
a temporary measure of relief against a pressing
evil, but it was impossible for me to bring my
mind to assent to the right of adopting it.
But suppose this difficulty surmounted, there are
others which I regard as insurmountable Among
them the fiscal objection is very formidable The
revenue fiom the lands cannot be spared at pres-
ent, and if distributed, as proposed by the meas-
ure, would necessarily throw the whole expenses
of the Government on a single source—the duties
onimpmts—and which must be followed by their
increase This would neither be fair, nor equal,
and to which I, representing in part a portion of
the Union on which the increased burden would
mainly fall, cannot assent.
But as formidable as is this, there are others
far more so. It would not meet, or avert the ap-
proaching danger It would still leave the public
lands in the new States under the operation of the
present system, and the subject of violent conflict
between them and the old States, with all the ca
lamitous consequences to which I have adverted
Instead of preventing the danger, it would, in fact,
hasten and aggravate it It may be laid down as
a maxim, that no measure can avert it which is
not adopted with the approbation and consent of
the new States, for the simple reason that they
must soon become the predominant power, when
that which was established against their consent
would be certainly overthrown Such would be
the case with the measure under consideration If
adopted, it must npt only be without the consent
of those States, but with their strenuous opposi
tion, of which we have had the most conclusive
evidence on the present occasion When moved
by its author, as an amendment to this bill, it was
violently opposed at the threshold from that quar-
ter, and received but a single vote from the new
States It is not necessary to inquire whether this
opposition on their part is reasonable, or not,
whether it is the result of mere prejudice, or of
deliberate conviction that it is hostile to their in-
terests. The fact itself, that there is an almost
universal and determined resistance to the measure
on their part, right or wrong, is, of itself, suf-
ficient proof that it cannot be lehedon to avert the
threatening dangei On the contrary, Us necessary
effect must be to accelerate and aggravate it Its
adoption would, at once, bung the old and new
States into violent conflict, m which the former
would be arrayed, almost to a man,m determined
effort to overthrow the arrangement, or some more
hostile measure Add to this that the presidential
contest would not fail to run into the controversy,
and thus redouble the excitement and animosity,
with all the fatal consequences which 1 have
shown must follow from blending the two
Assuming, then, that the scheme is both objec-
tionable and inefficient, the question again occurs,
what ought to be done' My mind is made up,
after the most serious and deliberate reflection, that
there is, andean be, but one remedy, to cede—no,
that is not the proper, the constitutional word—to
dispose of the public lands to the States within the
limits of which they respectively he, on such terms
and under such conditions as shall, at the same
time, be just and liberal to the new States and safe
to the old We must, in a word, part with the
ownership and administration of the. lands lying withm
the States, leaving those in the Territories, and
Senate.
beyond, under the operation of the present system
The evil lies m ownership and administration, and
without parting with them no permanent or effectual
remedy can be applied.
But what shall be the teims—what portion of
the proceeds of the sales of those lands shall be
left to the States, to remunerate them for the ex-
pense, trouble, and lesponsibihty of their admin-
istration, and what portion shall be paid over to the
Government annually as a compensation for the
land > I am not prepared to answer the question I ts
decision must depend on a careful and minute ex-
amination of all the facts and encumstancesof the
case. But I am decidedly of the opinion that the
portion to be left to the new States ought not only
to be ample to cov*r the trouble, expense, and re-
sponsibility of management, but very considerably
beyond, so as to unite their interests with ours, in
order to give stability to the arrangement and in-
sure care and fidelity in the management. Resting
my estimate of the compensation on these princi-
ples, I have supposed that the new States might
pay over annually one half of the gross proceedp
of sales to the Government, and have an ample
( sum left for their compensation. But this is a
mere estimate, without sufficient data, and is, of
course, liable to be increased or diminished after
a careful calculation founded on facts.
With these suggestions as to the terms, I next
proceed to the conditions on which the lands ought
to be disposed of. I propose to suggest only the
most prominent, without pretending to a full enu-
meration.
In order to give stability to the arrangement, it
will be indispensable that the whole transaction
should assume the form of a compact; and for this
purpose, that Congress should pass an act contain-
ing the terms and conditions of the transfer, and
that each of the new States should pass one, on
their part, to be irrevocable, assenting to the same,
before it is made. The act of Congress should, of
course, determine what part of the proceeds is to
be paid annually to the Government, and the time
and manner of payment, and also to provide for
keeping regular books of accounts, to be open to
the inspection of the Government, so that the
exact state of the account between it and the
States, may, at all times, be ascertained by the
former
The act of Congress should also contain all the
prospective provisions which may become neces-
I sary in the future administration of the lands un-
der the an angement; and should then provide that
the land laws, as modified by the act, and as far
as they are applicable to the new state of things,
shall remain unchanged, without the consent of
Congress A provision of this kind would be not
less essential to the States, than to the Govern-
ment Without it there could be no stability nor
uniformity Without it the States would, in a
short time, enter into a competition to turn the
current of immigration, each towards itself, which
would commence by a reduction of price, and end
by a loss of the lands But with the provision
proposed, the system would retain its uniformity,
and become more stable than at present
To enforce the faithful execution of the compact,
the act should also contain a provision that, m the
event of the violation of the conditions of cession,
all grants thereafter made by the State should be
null and void. This would place the compact un-
der the protection of the courts of the Union, and
make it the interest of the State and its citizens to
observe it In this connection, the liberal allow-
ance proposed to be made to the States, in order
to unite their interests with ours, would be im-
portant The revenue which they would derive
fiom the land would be applied to roads, canals,
or other improvements, that would create a pow-
erful interest in favor of the arrangement, which,
with the conditions proposed, and their sense of
justice, would insure, I trust, on their part, a
faithful execution of the compact.
Such, as it appears to me, should be the leading
conditions, but, doubtless, there are many others
which would be suggested by full and careful ex-
amination of the subject.
This, Mr Presidentas the general outline of the
measurewhich I propose as a remedy, and which
brings up the important question, would it accom-
