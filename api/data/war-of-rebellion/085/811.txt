Kansas. You will also send a company of cavalry to take station at Fredericktown. Let the other companies march first, however, and at once. You will, if necessary, call all but one company from New Madrid, strengthening that part, if necessary, with infantry. I have telegraphed General McCormick as to the militia. Answer.

Lieutenant-General HILLER,

Cape Girardeau:

You will send the howitzers also to Pilot Knob. If possible send all your regiments to Pilot Knob, calling on General McCormick for such additional militia as you may need. I think your sub-district is to be defended from Pilot Knob against the rebel army when it retreats. I do not think it is in much danger from other quarters; still, I wish Bloomfield and the other outposts held.

Brigadier-General EWING:

I hear of small parties of rebels around Iron Mountain and vicinity. I think Harrison &amp; Co. are rotten to the core. There is a large amount of Government property here and at Hopwell, consisting of wagons, harness, &c.

Major H. H. WILLIAMS,

Pilot Knob:

I have ordered Lieutenant-Colonel Hiller to send you rations. A full supply will go down the railroad to-morrow. Hiller will send a company of cavalry to Fredericktown and two or three companies to Pilot Knob at once. How will it do to station two companies of infantry at Potosi now? If the Court-House is all right advise men and I will send them there to occupy the town and collect there such Government property as is lying loose around there. I have ordered the whole militia force along the line of the railroad down to the three burnt bridges to work
