just received a telegram from New Orleans
embodying a petition from twelve or fifteen of
the largest mercantile firms of the city regard-
ing the rice interest, and as it is short I ask
that it be read.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the paper will be read.
The Chief Clerk read as follows:
New Orleans, February 5,1872.
. Tho undersigned, merchants representing the rice
interests of Louisiana-, having the interest of our
constituents and State in view, respectfully beer of
youand your honorable colleagues to useyour influ-
ence in defeating the measures now before your
honorable body tor the abolition ot the duties upon
rice, as such a measure would be ruinous to the rice
culture of this State, which is and has been for sev-
eral years past one of our most important agricul-
tural industries. Our Legislature will pass resolu-
tions to that effect shortly, and will ask of your
honorable body to use your influence in defeating
these measures.

The VICE PRESIDENT. As the contents
of this paper have been disclosed by its read-
ing, the Chair must state that, it has been de-
cided by the Senate that telegrams or letters
addressed to Senators asking them to vote pro
or con on any measure pending before Con-
gress were not petitions or memorials. They
must be addressed to the Senate itself. The
Chair does'not make tho point; but it being
read in full, that fact is disclosed. If there
be no objection, however, the paper will be
referred to the Committee on Finance.
Mr. EDMUNDS. It oughtnot to be referred.
Mr. POMEROY. I wish to make this point
about it: there is no importance in it as con-
nected with this particular telegram, but I
make the point that a memorial or a petition
cannotbe sent by telegraph. It must be signed
by some one; it must be an actual document.
There is no importance attached to this point
in this case ; but the time will come possibly
when it may be of some importance. We have
no knowledge that a telegram is an original
document.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair, how-
ever, has stated on the other point which has
been ruled repeatedly in the Senate, that let-
ters addressed to Senators asking them to vote
pro or con on any measure are not petitions
or memorials within the language of the rule.
II they were allowed to be presented as peti-
tions, the whole morning hour might be con-
sumed.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I make that point be-
cause my friend from Louisiana has attained
his object, and as a precedent it is a very itn
proper thing to present letters or papers of
this kind here, because if allowed we should
sometimes be obliged to receive a letter that
it might be altogether improper to receive at
all. So I hope my friend from Louisiana will
withdraw it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The telegram
will be printed in full in the Globe, aa it has
been reported at tho Secretary's desk, and in
that way the object is probably attained.
