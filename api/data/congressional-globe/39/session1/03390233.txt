Mr. BROOKS. I desire to ask if thus stop-
ping the publication of this document until the
House committee reports may not postpone the
publication indefinitely. Is there not danger of
that?
Mr. LAFLIN. I answer that this refers to a
publication which was ordered some twelve years
since, and which has been suspended for the
last five or six years. The Superintendent of
the Astronomical Observatory is now ready to
present his report, and has notified the Superin-
tendent of Public Printing that the manuscript-
is ready for tho press. But inasmuch as there
is some question as to what Department this
printing belongs, and as there is also some
question as to the propriety of publishing this
fourth volume, it has been thought proper, at
a meeting of the joint committee, that,this reso-
lution should be presented to the House.
The SPEAKER. If there is any further
debate it must go over.
Mr. BROOKS. I have no objection, if it
has been a subjcct of consideration by the com-
mittee.
