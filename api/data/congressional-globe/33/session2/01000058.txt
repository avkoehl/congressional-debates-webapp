THE .CONGRESSIONAL. GLOBE.
December 15>
convictions are less than one hundred. I say,
then, upon the score of crime, upon the score ot
morals, I am ready to compare my State with that
of Massachusetts, or any one of the free States.
Where, then, is the moral curse which arises from
slavery ? . ,
A few facts in reference to physical develop-
ment. I had occasion, some time since, for
another purpose than the present, to look a little
into the statistics of Georgia, compared with those
of other States. I selected the State of Ohio, be-
cause it was one of the most prosperous of the
North—often styled,and, perhaps, justly too, the
giant of the West. According to the census re-
turns in 1850, Ohio had of improved lands
9,851,493 acres —Georgia had only 6,378,479
acres, the qpsh value of the Georgia land so im-
proved and under culture was $95,753,445, while
the cash value of the Ohio lands was returned at
$358,758,603—Ohio had nearly one third more
land in a state of improvement than Georgia had,
and returned at more than three times the cash
value of the Georgia lands. The whole popula-
tion of Ohio was 1,908,480, the whole population
of Georgia, white and black, was 905,999. The
population of Ohio, therefore, was more than
double that of Georgia. Here we see her free
labor more than double in number, working one
third more land, worth, by valuation, more than
three times that of Georgia. From these elements
it might not be surprising to see her agricultural
products greatly exceeding those of Georgia,
without resorting to the "curse of slavery" to
account for it. But how stand the facts? Ohio
produced the following articles:

This list includes nearly every agricultural pro-
duct of the earth in that State except hay, which
is omitted, because in Georgia there is no return
for fodder, which, in that State, answers the same
purpose of hay in Ohio, as food for stock. The
quantity of each product produced is given from
the census tables. The values run out are such
as are believed to be the usual average values of
each article in that State, except the products of
gardens and orchards, which are taken from the
tables—no other values are put upon the products
in the tables. The estimate above stated is be-
lieved to be a fair one. Now let us take up the
returns for Georgia and place upon them a like
estimated average value. Here we have:

Aggregate.
An amount so far from falling under that of
Ohio as might have been expected, actually ex-
ceeds it above a quarter of a million, without
extending the Georgia list to rye, barley, tobacco,
and other articles which are produced in that State.
Away, then, with this prating cry about slavery's
paralyzing the energy of a people, and opposing
the development of the resources of a country.
If I were to take the statistics of any other
State, and go through them in the same way, I
have no reason to doubt that an equally favoraole
result to Georgia would follow. I took the State
of Ohio, not as any disparagement to her, but to
show that even in the South, where they say the
soil is sterile,and the population inert,and cursed
with slavery, as it is said to be, Georgia, with one
half of the population, and only two thirds of the
value of land, exceeds in agricultural products by
one quarter of a million of dollars, the great giant
of the West.
Now, then, if the people of Kansas, the people
of Nebraska, or the people of any other portion
of our territory, going from old Massachusetts,
going from New York, or from Indiana, or from
the Soulh, learning and consulting wisdom frofn
the past, and profiting by experience from all
parts of the Union, should think it practically
best for the happiness of themselves and for
their posterity in the far distant future, to adopt
the social institutions of Georgia in preference to
those of Indiana, if they prefer the institutions of
the South to those of the North, 1 say they should
not be deprived of their right to do it, and the
gentleman from Indiana, and those who act with
hipi> should not set themselves up as judges and
" masters " to control the matter.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. CAMPBELL then addressed the commit-
tee during an hour, in reply to the gentleman
from Georgia. His remarks, withheld for re-
vision, will be published in the Appendix.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I desire to
disabuse the mind of the gentleman from Georgia
in regard to the result of the Illinois election. I
know, sir, it may be a little distasteful for gentle-
men to hear the truth in regard lo it. As has been
stated, the issue had been fairly and fully made
by the Senator from my State, [Mr. Douglas.],
It was made by him, sustained by hjm all over
the State, with a zeal and talent worthy a better
cause. And what was the result? Why, sir,
the popular vote in this State was sixteen thou-
sand against the Kansas and Nebraska measure.
Sir, look at the congressional districts, look, too,
at the vote as it stood here upon the Kansas and
Nebraska bill.
Let them examine the popular vote for the
members of Congress in the various^ districts,
and they will then find what is the opinion of Illi-
nois upon this subject. "Why, sir,  
The CHAIRMAN. The time for general dis-
cussion has now expired. The bill will be now
read for amendments.
Mr. 'WHEELER. I move that the committee
do now rise.
Mr. ORR. I hope the motion to rise may not
prevail, and that the bill will be reported to the
House before we adjourn.
The question was taken; and the committee
refused to rise.
The Clerk then proceeded to read the bill by
sections for amendments.
When the reading had proceeded to the section
making provisions for the Miamies,
Mr. HARLAN, of Indiana, offered the follow-
ing amendment:
For deficiency of lands west of the Mississippi river,
granted to said tube by tlio treaty of 1840,  dollars.
Mr. H. said: By the treaty of 1840 with the
Miamies, a tract of land west of the Mississippi
was assigned to that tribe of Indians, described by
\ certain boundaries, and purporting to contain five
I hundred thousand ac.rc-s; in consideration of which
! the tribe were to relinquish the lands owned by
; them, in the State of Indiana. At the time of the
ii cession, the country in which their tract was
j! assigned was a wilderness, unknown to even the
ij whitecitizens of the United States, and much less
j[ was it known to the Miami Indians. They con-
'! fided, therefore, to the representations made by
;! the Government of the United States, which as-
sured them that they were to receive five hundred
II thousand acres of land. This was done in 1840,
11 but in 1854, just fourteen years thereafter, it was
j ascertained, for the first time, that there was a
! deficiency in their lands amounting to one hundred
! and thirty-odd thousand acres.
; A portion of the tribe, however, and the portion
| for which I ask the money provided in this amend-
: ment, did not accede to the terms of the treaty,
jl arid this portion, comprising more than half of the
'' tribe, remained in the State of Indiana. The
other portion removed west of the Mississippi,
and have since been in possession of the land ceded
to the tribe. By the treaty of 1854, the whole
tract was confirmed to this portion of the tribe,
thus depriving a majority of the Indians of all
compensation whatever. It was ascertained that
the whole number of the tribe in 18.54 was five
hundred and fifty, of which only two hundred and
forty-eight were west of the Mississippi river.
The others, more than three hundred in number, '
live in Indiana, and for them I ask that this de-
ficiency may be made up.
I have left the blank to be filled by the committee
as they shall think proper.
Mr. PARKER. This is an important amend-
ment, and to enable the gentleman from Indiana to
get it properly before the committee, I move that
the committee do now rise.
Mr. ORR. I hope not. I think the committee
can very easily finish the bill to-night.
The question was put, and the motion agreed to.
The committee accordingly rose;and theSpeaker
having resumed the chair, the Chairman [Mr.
Chandler] reported that the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union had had under
consideration the state of the Union generally, and
particularly House bill No. 555, being the Indian
appropriation bill, and had come to no conclusion
thereon; and then,
On motion by Mr. McMULLIN, tne House (at
ten minutes before three t^c'ock, p. m.) adjourned
until to-morrow, at twelve o'clock, m.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, December 15, 1854.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m. Prayer
by Rev. Hessy Sljcer.
The Journal of yesterday was read and approved.
EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS.
The SPEAKER laid before the House a com-
munication from the President of the United
States, transmitting a report from the Secretary
of State, with accompanying documents, in com-
pliance with the resolution of the House of Rep-
resentatives of 27th July last.
Mr. ORR. What resolution was that ?
The SPEAKER, (after conferring with the
clerks.) It was a resolution calling for informa-
tion with reference to the expulsion of the Greeks
from Egypt.
Mr. ORR. I move that the message be laid
upon the table and printed.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I presume that there may
be something in that message that may render it
proper that it should go to the Committee on For-
eign Affairs.
Mr. ORR. I have no objection to that refer-
ence, and withdraw my motion.
Mr. CLINGMAN. Then I move that the
message be referred to the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, and printed.
The motion was agreed to.
The SPEAKER also laid before the House a
communication from the Secretary of War, in-
forming the House that he has transmitted to the
Senate the report of the board of officers appointed
under the Gth section of the Army appropriation
bill of 1852, for the examination of claims con-
tracted in California, under Lieutenant Colonel
Fremont in 184G and 1847; which was ordered
to lie upon the table, and be printed.
Also, a communication from the Treasury De-
partment, submitting supplemental estimates of
funds required for the service of that Department
for the fiscal year ending 30th June, 1856, based
on information received from distant parts of the
Union since the regular estimates were laid before
Congress.
On motion by Mr. HAVEN, said communica-
tion was referred to the Committee of Ways and
Means, and ordered to be printed.
PRINTING OF THE POST OFFICE REPORT.
Mr. JONES, of New York. I ask leave to in-
troduce a resolution from the Post Office Com-
mittee, for the purpose of reference merely. It is
as follows:
Resolved, That there be printed for the use of the Post-
master General's otlice fifteen huiulted copies of his annual
report, and the appendix, accompanying the President's
annual message.
There being no objection, the resolution was
received and referred, under the rule, to the Com-
mittee on Printing.
