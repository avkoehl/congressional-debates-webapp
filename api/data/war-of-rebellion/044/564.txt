HEADQUARTERS DANIEL'S BRIGADE, August 20, 1863.

MAJOR: In compliance with orders received from division headquarters, I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of my brigade from June 4 (the time the division left Grace Church) to July 20, when, in consequence of sickness, I turned over the command to Colonel Brabble: The brigade, consisting of the Thirty-second, Forty-third, Forty-fifth, and Fifty-third Regiments, and Seconds Battalion North Carolina troops (in all about 2, 200 men), left Grace Church with the division on June 4, and marched in the direction of Culpeper Court-House, which place we reached on the 7th without encountering the enemy, and encamped 3 miles beyond the town. On the morning of the 9th, firing was heard in the direction of Brandy Station, and I received orders to proceed in that direction. About 12 o'clock, I arrived near Brandy Station, and received orders from Lieutenant-General Ewell and General Lee to proceed to the station, and report to Brigadier-General Hampton. Upon arriving at the station, I reported to General Hampton, and was by him placed in line of battle about 1 mile in advance of the station, to support some cavalry that had fallen back before the enemy, their skirmishers being at this time a little in advance of their position, and their artillery firing upon the enemy at long range. A short time after this, I received orders from the major-general commanding the division to throw out skirmishers to the front, and move my line half mile to the rear. After remaining in this position a short time, the enemy began to retire, and I received orders to advance my skirmishers and retire my line still farther to the rear, keeping my troops concealed behind the hills during the movement. The enemy retired before my line of skirmishers. About 5 p. m. I received orders to call in my skirmishers, and move to a wood near the Botts House, and there go into camp.
