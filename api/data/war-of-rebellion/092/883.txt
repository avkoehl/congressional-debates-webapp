OCONEE BRIDGE, November 22, 1864.

Captain R. W. B. ELLIOTT:

I do not think the enemy who entered Gordon yesterday were over 200 strong; they are probably the same party who entered Milledgeville the day before. I have sent Captain brown down with a train this morning after supplies. Please have a train furnished him so he may return immediately.

AUGUSTA, November 22, 1864.

Major - General McLAWS:

Your telegram received. As president of the senate I have assumed command of the militia of the State east of the Oconee River, and have ordered all able-bodied men to report to me here. I will try and see General Wayne today, and conceive some measure with him to impede the enemy's progress. Am short of arms; can you furnish

any? Date of my commission, June 3, 1862.

A. R. WRIGHT.

RICHMOND, VA., November 22, 1864.

General B. D. FRY,

Augusta, GA.:

You will, to enable Colonel Rains to sane the valuable machinery, allow him such of his workmen and such amount of transportation as may be necessary. The great and first wish being the repulse of the enemy in the event of an advance on Augusta, every other consideration will be regarded as subordinate to that.

JEFF'N DAVIS.

General S. COOPER,
