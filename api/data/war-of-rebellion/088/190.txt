Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Chief of Staff.

[AUGUST 14, 1864.]

General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

General Grant telegraphs me that General Meade has been directed to watch closely, and if operations on the north side of the James force the enemy to weaken his lines at Petersburg to take advantage of it without further instructions. In that case General Meade has been authorized to call upon the Eighteenth Corps for co-operation, and you will receive orders from him.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 14, 1867-7.45 a. m.

Major-General ORD,

Commanding Eighteenth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that if he finds the enemy's intrenchments very thinly held, in consequence of troops being sent across the James to meet the movement of General Hancock, he will withdraw the whole of the Fifth Corps from the intrenchments. He desires to know whether you will be able in such event to extend to your left and occupy any part of the line now held by the Ninth Corps.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 14, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have now only one man to the yard on my line. The enemy's line is reported two ranks deep, and I do not deem it advisable, while their line is so heavy, to reduce mine. All my reserves are working on redoubts.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
