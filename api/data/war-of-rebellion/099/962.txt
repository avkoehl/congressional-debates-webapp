GENERAL: I have just received your dispatch of 10 a. m., and congratulate you most heartily upon your success. I find that the dispositions I have made here are in accordance with your wishes. I will do all possible to hurry up the railroad. The last reports are quite favorable. I think we may expect the cars here in four or five days at farthest.

Very respectfully,

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Cox's Bridge, March 22, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Army of the Ohio, Goldsborough:

GENERAL: I send Major McCoy in with a letter for General Grant, which I wish you to send with dispatch. I will come in to-morrow and the troops will begin to arrive to-morrow evening and next day. I propose to group this army at Goldsborough north of the Neuse and east of Little River--your present force about Kinston, and General Terry's about Faison's. The cavalry will be posted at Mount Olive--all this for the sake of forage. I hope that the Wilmington road will feed Generals Kilpatrick and Terry.

Yours,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: In your letter of yesterday you speak of putting me at Kinston and Terry at Faison's, while the main army remains about Goldsborough. Unless you have special reasons for this disposition, I would much prefer to have my troops at the same place while preparing for future operations. I have a good deal to do to get them in proper shape. Will you please let me see you before the order is made?

Yours, very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
