CUMBERLAND, February 3, 1864- 10 a. m.

Governor BOREMAN,

Wheeling.

The enemy has been driven back from the line of the railroad at all points and is now in full retreat, being vigorously pursued by our troops. The damage to the North Branch and Patterson's Creek bridges is but trifling. Will be repaired in two day. The Baltimore and Ohio Railroad will be again in working order; telegraph lines will be working this evening.

Brigadier- General.

CUMBERLAND, February 3, 1864- 8. 30 p. m.

Brigadier- General SULLIVAN,

Harper's Ferry:

Prisoners captured to- day report that Rosser was to have gone by the North western pike toward Winchester and formed a junction with Imboden and then attack Martinsburg, which he supposed weakened by the withdrawal of troops to support me, but your cavalry coming to Romney prevented his plans. You will therefore look out and be ready.

Brigadier- General.

CUMBERLAND, February 3, 1864- 1. 30 a. m.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

New Creek:

If you send 300 or 400 infantry to Greenland Gap, McNeill cannot get out of the Alleghany with cattle. He must come out by the Moorefield and Alleghany pike unless there is some road south of that that I never heard of, or you might send the force to the junction of the Alleghany pike with the Northwestern road. Consult with parties from that country. McNeill ought to be prevented from getting out, if possible.

Brigadier- General.

CUMBERLAND February 3, 1864- 12m.

Colonel MULLIGAN,

New Creek:

Captain Myers reports from Frankfort that Rosser went up Patterson's Creek with his prisoners toward Sheets' Mills, where it was reported he had two regiments infantry awaiting his return. Myers says it is understood at Frankfort that Rosser would go out by the Trough road, on east side of South Branch, crossing at Romney.
