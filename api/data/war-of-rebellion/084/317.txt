STEWARTSVILLE, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

Three hundred guerrillas attacked Plattsburg this morning; killed Captain Turney. The messenger from Captain Poe has just arrived, asking re-enforcements. All our mounted men left here for Cameron and Kingston this morning. We have no force to send.

P. A. JOSEPHS,

Major.

CAMERON, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

We have just this moment received intelligence that Plattsburg was sacked last night by a western force of rebels. They are concentrating with the eastern force, which sacked Mirabile, about eight miles south of this place. What are we to do?

GEO. SMITH.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 21, 1864.

GEORGE SMITH,

Cameron:

Major Cox is after the guerrillas with about 400 men from Chillicothe, and points eastward. Let there be a concentration of all our force, and a prompt attack and persistent pursuit of the fiends.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

CAMERON, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

We have just got the news that the rebels are about 200 strong, about eight miles due south from here, near Colonel Smith's farm. If we had a sufficient number of men we would move on them this morning.

C. E. PACKARD.

CAMERON, July 21, 1864.

General FISK:

The rebels took possession of Mirabile last night about 10 o'clock, robbed the stores, and tore up the town generally. The citizens were in arms just out of town, but as their force was too small to make resistance they left and came to Cameron. Doctor Crawford's son was in the town when the rebels were there. He states that they scattered the plunder taken from the stores along the road leading this way about one mile from Mirabile, and then turned to the left toward Plattsburg. They probably have been in Plattsburg before now.

C. E. PACKARD.

SAINT JOSEPH, July 21, 1864.

GEORGE SMITH,

Cameron:

Have the Plattsburg troops joined you at Cameron? Has Captain McDonald been heard from? What few troops can be spared from here
