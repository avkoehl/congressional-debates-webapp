General-in-Chief.

MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., February 2, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Have made no communication to the Governor of Massachusetts, nor to any other Governor, requesting troops or other supplies. Have, therefore, no copies of such communication. Never expect to ask or receive the President's permission, nor to make, without his permission, requisitions on Governors for troops or supplies.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS UNITED STATES FORCES, Forts Henry, Heiman, and Donelson, February 2, 1863.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,Murfreesborough, Tenn.:

Reports, confirmed by spy, that rebels have guns planted above and below near Palmyra, in a most eligible position, the country being broken and difficult of access. Have sent word to Colonel Bruce that any move he may make will receive co-operation from Donelson, and, if possible, from this point. Rebels reported to have an immediate force of 1,000 and 2,000 within easy supporting distance. I think the number must be exaggerated. Are there any gunboats above?

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,
