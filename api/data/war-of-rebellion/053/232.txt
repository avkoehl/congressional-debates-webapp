MUNFORDVILLE, October 9, 1863.

Captain A. C. SEMPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville:

All quiet about Glasgow and on the railroad. I am trying to capture 30 or 40 rebels under command of Richardson. I have started three detachments in pursuit. Hope he will be intercepted to-night at Three Springs, on the old Lexington road. Rebels were within 8 miles of that place at sunset.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 9, 1863.

Captain SEMPLE,

Louisville:

It is possible that Richardson divided his force. The party that I allude to passed through Hodgensville to-day. They were 6 miles southeast of Elizabethtown at 8 a.m. Have you any information about Colonel Spaulding's movements? Is three any cavalry force at Lebanon? Please inform me.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 9, 1863.

Major MARTIN,

Glasgow:

Have you any news? How many men of your command are at Glasgow?

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 9, 1863.

Major MARTIN,

Glasgow:

The rebels, 30 in number, with stolen mules, are going in direction of Three Springs. Send your cavalry in that direction; get on their track and pursue them; capture and kill every devil of them. I am sending some men from this point.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 9, 1863.

Major MARTIN,

Glasgow:

Send Lieutenant Adam's squad mounted infantry to Rocky Hill Station, thence up railroad to this place. Captain Beck will move with his mounted men by Goose Horn to Little Barren River. If he should hear of guerrilla bands he will pursue and capture them. Thirty rebels are supposed to be returning from East Tennessee in direction of Barren River. If he hears of no rebels he will move from Barren River to this place. Your men are not legitimately paroled. Let the mounted men move immediately.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
