HOLLY SPRINGS, December 21, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Cavalry here or close by. Your message forwarded.

C. C. MARSH,

Colonel Commanding.

OXFORD, MISS., December 21, 1862.

Colonel C. C. MARSH, Holly Springs, Miss.:

The enemy should be pursued. If they have gone north, pursuit may prevent them doing further damage, and by throwing infantry and artillery off in the direction they wish to return, they might be considerably damaged. There will be two divisions in Holly Springs to-morrow.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

OXFORD, MISS., December 21, 1862.

Colonel C. C. MARSH, Holly Springs:

Send a company of cavalry through to learn news from Jackson. The company can go to Grand Junction and call on commanding officer there for another company. If the wires are not at work to send by telegraph they can go until an office is found that has communication. Forward the inclosed for General Halleck.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, December 21, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Scouts returned from Lamar. No enemy in that vicinity. All information leads to the belief that after going a short distance north they took a southeasterly course toward Rocky Ford.

C. C. MARSH,

Colonel, Commanding.

HOLLY SPRINGS,

December 21, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Nothing yet from troops sent north. Information varies as to direction taken by enemy. It is certain that a portion, and that a large one, moved back on the road they came in on. Their numbers have been underrated by us.

C. C. MARSH,

Colonel, Commanding District.

HOLLY SPRINGS, December 21, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Shall I endeavor to countermand orders to fall back from Grand Junction and to destroy property?

C. C. MARSH,

Colonel, Commanding.
