Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg:

A telegram from General Sigel, just received, states that the enemy, to the number of 20,000 or 30,000, have been crossing at Antietam Ford and Shepherdstown for forty hours. Your telegram received at the same time makes no mention of any enemy, except "Imboden's men stealing a few horses. " We have nothing to confirm General Sigel's report. Have you any information from Antietam Ford or Shepherdstown? Answer immediately what measures you have taken to obtain accurate information of the enemy's movements, and the facts so far as you have learned.
