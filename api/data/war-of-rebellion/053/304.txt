forward to the Tennessee River at once. I find some of my troops at Moscow, some here. All must come forward, and I will see that cars are pushed in to bring out forage and provisions. Hatch's cavalry is ample to which Chalmers. I beat him off with less than 500 men, and I know that if attacked with vigor he will be driven as far as you please.

I think you should hold a brigade from Memphis in motion near Byhalia and Quinn's Mill all the time.

CORINTH, October 12 [13], 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

I will push all cars into Memphis. Please order them to be loaded at night and sent out by day. Every car and locomotive should be in use. I do not think citizens should be allowed to travel on this railroad at all. I believe Chalmers' force is the only force near Memphis, and Hatch can drive it into pieces and fragments if he pushes them hard. I will work all my troops forward, and hasten to reach the Tennessee River, for of course the enemy is intent on reaching Rosecrans' rear. Chalmers' move is a feint to draw off our attention; therefore chase him below the Tallahatchie. Instruct your cavalry to take all horses and mules between the railroad and the Tallahatchie, burn all mills and corn-fields, and let them feel that to attack our road will be surely followed by vengeance. Several of the dead at Collierville had your oath of allegiance and all sorts of passes on their persons.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

COLLIERVILLE, October 12, 1863.-12 m.

Major-General HURLBUT:

The repairers needed between here and Germantown on the small culverts, one of which is finished and men at work on the other two. One engine received a cannon shot which carried away some lever, so that the engine cannot be reversed.

It was the trains from Corinth came down this way to La Fayette, but turned back on hearing the firing, spreading the report that I was gabbed up &amp;c. I sent a courier to La Fayette last night to explain the whole matter, so that I hope early to-morrow all will be right.

General Corse is here with one brigade, and his other brigades close at hand. I think I will try and make Chalmers feel he cannot attack us unpunished. We gave him more than he expected yesterday, and will try to treat him so that he will remember it as long as he lives. All well with us now.

In the fight yesterday regulars lost 9 dead, 27 wounded, and 7 missing at present. Colonel Anthony's loss is about the same; his pickets were caught in the start.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
