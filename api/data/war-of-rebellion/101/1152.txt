HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, March 11, 1865 (Received 7. 20 p. m.)

Major- General HALLECK, Washington, D. C.:

The resignation of several brigadier-generals and the unfitness of others has forced General Dodge to apply for two or three officers of that grade to serve in Missouri. Discreet and prudent men are needed. He asks for Brigadier General J. W. Sprague, Brigadier General J. A. Williamson, Brigadier General J. C. Veatch, Brigadier General J. W. Fuller. Two or three of these officers, or others equally good, are greatly needed. Please answer.

JOHN POPE,

Major- General.

General DODGE:

Will you come up some time this morning to talk about your order about McNeil and Fisk and other matters!

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.

JEFFERSON CITY, March 11, 1865- 10. 45 a. m.

Major General G. M. DODGE,

Commanding Department of the Missouri:

I desire to issue a general order to- day relieving all the Enrolled Missouri Militia from active service, in order that all public property in the possession of that force may be properly turned over and accounted for prior to the date fixed by an act of the general assembly of Missouri, stating the commission of all officers on that force. I do not wish, however, to do this if it will tend to embarrass district commanders. I desire to consult your wishes in the matter before acting.

Please answer.

THOS. C. FLETCHER,

Governor of Missouri.

Governor FLETCHER, Jefferson City:

I don't think it will embarrass us much. The troops being raised under Order Numbers 3 will probably replace them.
