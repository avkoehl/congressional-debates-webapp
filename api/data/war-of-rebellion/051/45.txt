The enemy is moving with steady step upon my position-it is a strong one-and will no doubt attack early in the morning.

My troops I cannot get into position in time to attack myself at so early an hour as day-dawn. If I find he is not going to attack me I will attack him without delay.

I send you a map* of the situation. I send this by a staff officer.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General MACKALL.
HDQRS. POLK'S CORPS, ARMY OF TENNESSEE,At Mrs. Park's, near Rock Spring,

September 17, 1863-10.30 p. m.

GENERAL: My divisions left La Fayette this p. m. as soon as the roads were clear, and arrived at the end of their march about 10 o'clock. I have caused Cheatham's division to be bivouacked in nearly the same position which it formerly occupied. It followed Walker's command. Hindman's division moved out on the Crawfish Valley road, and is now encamped with its right near the point at which Cheatham's left rests, and extends thence in the direction night. Early tomorrow morning permanent dispositions will be made. I find Worthen's Gap guarded by a brigade of Armstrong's cavalry, which is supported by Wharton's division of cavalry. I understand that Van Cleve's and Palmer's divisions are on the Crawfish Spring road leading up the cove. I learn of no enemy on my right. General Armstrong informs me that he finds some of the Mills; the force not known. He is picketing the Crawfish Valley road as far as Glass' Mill. The space between Pea Vine Church and Worthen's Gap is too long for my corps.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General. Commanding.

Brigadier-General MACKALL, Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. POLK'S CORPS, September 18, 1863-8.15 a. m.

GENERAL: The order to move my corps at 6.30 a. m. was received at 6.15, and issued immediately. General Cheatham's division is in motion on the Long Hollow road. General Anderson moves on the Gordon's Mills road from Dr. Anderson's. I have ordered Armstrong to move a regiment ahead of each column; to move two regiments forward to the ford near Glass' Mill, and to hold Worthen's Gap and cover my flank with a brigade. It will be perceived that this force of cavalry is inadequate should the enemy, reported to be in force beyond Worthen's Gap, press on that flank. I have ordered my ordnance trains to be placed at Pea Vine Church, and shall myself move on the Gordon's Mills road.

Most respectfully, general, your obedient servant,L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Brigadier-General MACKALL, Chief of Staff.
