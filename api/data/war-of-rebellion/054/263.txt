ferry-boat has been used to pass over the division of Ewing and its artillery, and wagons have been forded. Sherman expects to get his whole army over by noon to-morrow, all its parts, including Granger's, being up. The distance hence to Knoxville is 34 miles. Our advices from that place are to the 1st instant, and are derived from a rebel mail captured last night.

Longstreet assaulted Burnside on the 29th ultimo, and was repulsed with the loss of 1,000 men of McLaws' division. They reached the ditch of the work they attacked, but were unable to cross it. Two regiments appear to have been captured by the garrison. Longstreet still remains at Knoxville, and very evidently supposes this army to be only a small force. All the letter-writers speak of their condition in great despondency, and regard their chance of extrication as very poor. Nights cold; days beautiful.

KNOXVILLE, December 6, 1863-3 p.m.

Sherman arrived at noon, leaving the Fifteenth Corps at Maryville with orders to halt there, and the Eleventh Corps at Louisville. Granger, with his two divisions, moves toward Sevierville to cut off any stray part of Longstreet's force that may endeavor to escape by way of the French Broad, direct pursuit of Longstreet from here being impracticable with infantry. Sherman will at once move back toward Chattanooga with all of his troops, except the command of Granger, taking the road by way of Columbus and Benton, not only because that country has not been eaten out by armies, but also that he may conveniently strike at Dalton if circumstances favor and Grant so desires.

The only ill luck in this quarter so far is the failure of Elliott to get up with his cavalry, which was at Liberty on the 26th ultimo, got orders to move to Kingston on the 27th, and should have crossed the Clinch by the 30th at farthest. Nothing has yet been heard of him. No news here from Foster.

Yesterday morning, after Longstreet retreated, Burnside had fully twenty days' provisions, much more, in fact, than at the beginning of the siege. These supplies had been drawn from the French Broad by boats and by the Sevierville road. The people of the country did their utmost through the whole time to send in provisions and forage, and Longstreet left open the very avenues which Burnside most desired. Boats came down the Holston in open day without being fired upon, and the Sevierville road was never interrupted. The losses of our forces here from the first contact with Longstreet near Loudon until the evacuation will not exceed 1,000. Ammunition got very short before the siege was over, and projectiles for our rifle guns were made here. The utmost constancy and unanimity prevailed during the whole siege, from Burnside down to the last private; no man thought of retreat or surrender. I return to Chattanooga as soon as possible, probably leaving to-morrow; arrive there 12th or 13th.
