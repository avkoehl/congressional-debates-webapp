1868.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE*

their place, until the legal tenders should be
reduced to 5250,000,000. My second object
was gradually to build up a safe and solvent
banking system, the capital of which, at the
proper time, would lend its aid to effect the
resumption of specie payments. I did not
intend to indicate that 1 would not be willing
to withdraw the remaining $250,000,000 at the
proper time, but I did intend to indicate that
another Congress could act on that subject
with a better knowledge of its effects than we
possibly can.
Before I pass from this subject I desire to
say that whatever plan may be adopted for un-
raveling the tangled skein of our finances,
something should be done to prevent, if possi-
ble, those frequent monetary revulsions which
belong to- specie-paying periods. The day
when paper money shall cease to be used in the
United States none of us will ever see. When-
ever paper money is based upon and redeem-
able in coin, panics will occur. When runs
are made upon the banks they contract their
circulation and discounts, thereby increasing
the very evils which they should be able to check
and prevent. If, in these seasons of sudden
contraction the banks could be temporarily
permitted to redeem in Government notes, they
could furnish relief to the community instead
of forcing them to bankruptcy. These notes
should be furnished by the Treasury Depart-
ment on deposit of Government securities to
be withdrawn when the exigency has passed.
In alluding to the suggestions contained in
my proposition I must not be understood as
urging them upon the Senate. My future course
will be determined by the fate of the motion
which I have submitted. If it is adopted I
shall see some hope in the future. If it is de-
feated I trust that no funding bill will be passed
during this session.

Mr. HOWARD. Mr. President 
Mr. ANTHONY. I believe the regular
order of business was laid aside informally,
was it not?
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It was.
MESSAGE FItOM TIIE IIOCSE.
A message from the House of Representa-
tives, by Mr. McPheksox, its Clerk, announced
that the House had passed the bill (S. No. 237)
in relation to the promulgation of the laws of
the United States.
The message also announced that the House
had passed the following bills, in which it
requested the concurrence of the Senate:
A bill (H. R. No. 384) to authorize the
building of a railroad bridge across the Ohio
river at Paducah, Kentucky;
A bill (H. R. No. 764) for the relief of cer-
tain exporters of distilled spirits; and
A bill (H. R. No. 832) making appropria-
tions for the service of the Post Office Depart-
ment during the fiscal year ending Juue 80;
1869.
ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED.
The message further announced that the
Speaker of the House had signed the follow-
ing enrolled bills, which were thereupon signed
by the President pro tempore:
A bill (H. R. No. 858) for the relief of the
settlers on the late Sioux Indian reservation in
the State of Minnesota; and
A bill (H. R. No. 060) restoring lands to
market along the line of the Pacific railroads
and branches.
IMPEACHMENT Ot PRESIDENT JOHNSON.
Mr. HOWARD. I move the adoption of
the following resolution and orders in relation
to the impeachment:
Resolved, That at one o'clock to-morrow afternoon
the Senate will proceed to consider the impeachment
of Andrew Johnson* President of the United States,
at which time the oath or affirmation required by the
rules of the Senate sitting forthetrial of an impeach-
ment, shall be administered by the Chief Justice of
the United States as the presiding ofiieer of the Sen-
ate sitting as aforesaid, to each member of tbo Senate,
and that the Senate sitting as aforesaid will at lha
time aforesaid receive tho managers appointed by
the House of Representatives.
Ordered, That tile Secretary lay this resolution
before the House of Representatives.
Ordered, That the articles of impeachment exhib-
ited against Andrew Johnson, President of the Uni-
ted States, be printed.
Ordered, That a copy of the "rulesofproeedure and
practice in the Senate when sitting on the trial of
impeachments" bo communicated by the Secretary
to the House of Representatives, and a cony thereof
delivered by him to each member of the House.
Mr. GRIMES. Let the vote be taken on
each proposition seriatim.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on agreeing to the first resolution.
Mr. DIXON. I object to the consideration
of the resolution.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection
having been made, the resolution will lie over
under the rules, as a matter of course.
Mr. ANTHONY. Now, I suppose the mat-
ter which was laid aside informally to allow the
Senator from Missouri to make his remarks is
regularly before the Senate.
Mr. l^OMEROY. Do I understand that the
orders offered by the Senator from Michigan
were objected to? I supposed only the resolu 
tion was objected to.
Mr. HOWARD. There can be no objection
to printing the articles and furnishing the rules
to members of the House of Representatives.
I take it there will be no objection to that.
The PRESIDENTpro tempore. There are
several independent propositions in the paper
submitted by the Senator from Michigan. The
question is whether the objection applies to all
or only to some of them.
Mr. SHERMAN. Who objected? I did not
hear any one object.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Connecticut objected.
Mr. POMEROY. I ask whether his objec-
tion can prevent the passage of the orders
which have been offered, lie may object to
the passage of the resolution.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Chair
understands an order to be in the nature of a
resolution.
Mr. POMEROY. I apprehend that an ob-
jection to the consideration of a mere order
does not of necessity carry it over until to>
morrow.
Mr. DIXON. I objected only with a view
of looking at the proposition and seeing what
it is. I now withdraw the objection.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The objec-
tion is withdrawn, and the question is on agree-
ing to the resolution offered by the Senator
from Michigan.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I am entirely-willing, of
course, that notice should be given to the House
of Representatives that by our standing rules
at one o'clock to-morrow we proceed with the
organization upon the cause they have pre-
sented; but I am opposed to the first part of
the resolution which resolves that to-morrow
at one o'clock we will proceed, for the reason
that the standing rules which we have adopted
provide for it expressly, as much so as our
other standing rules do for meeting at twelve
o'clock; and as a mere matter of precedent I
should hope my friend from Michigan would
not insist on that part of the resolution, be-
cause it would seem to imply that for every-
thing which the rules require us to do we have
got to have a resolution, to the consideration
of which any Senator may object, and we be-
come paralyzed in that way. I hope the reso-
lution maybe modified so as to provide merely
that notice shall be given to the House of Rep-
resentatives that at one o'clock to-morrow
the Senate will proceed under its rules.
Mr. HOWARD. The reason of my draw-
ing the resolution in that form is this: the
rules which we have adopted for our proceed-
ings are a sort of private arrangement among
