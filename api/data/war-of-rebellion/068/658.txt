General HANCOCK:

Wright says his right is attacked. Warren is attacking, but it is of the utmost importance you should press on.

MEADE.

SECOND ARMY CORPS,

May 12, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

I must get line [in] order first, or i may have trouble, before pressing on. I have used all the men through the woods nearly, and they have lost their organization. I am now using the artillery against them and some of enemy's. We have captured a good many guns. I suppose 3,000 prisoners. I cannot hear how many. Possibly more.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

HANCOCK'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 12, 1864 - 8.50 a. m.

General WILLIAMS:

The enemy have been attacking us with great vehemence. I am now taking prisoners from Rodes' division. We will push forward as soon as this attack is repulsed, but now I am watching my right very closely along the stream. Burnside is not strongly connected with me, though I have had some of his stragglers come in to my left. i hope he will make a strong connection soon. I have no doubt he will.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
