Wo could get any amount of names if necessary.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. Here is another,
and one of the names signed to it is that of Mi*.
Starne, formerly Democratic Secretary of State
of Illinois; a gentleman of as high standing as any
in the State.
The Clerk read as follows:
Griggsville, November 23, 1858.
To the Hon. a. v. Brown, Postmaster General:
We, the undersigned, citizens ofGrigcsville.Pike county,
Illinois, would respectfully represent that we aie members
of the Democratic party, and that we labored, in our humble
wav, for James Buchanan, in 1856; and we do enter our
protest against the appointment of Robert Allen as post-
master for the town of Griggsville : first, because he is not
qualified to fill the office; second, because he has never
been a reliable Democrat; third, because he has been co-
operating with the Black Republicans; fuuith,hi  deputies
aie all Black"Republicans.
For the above reasons, we think that a Democratic Ad-
ministration ought not to hesitate a moment, but remove
lmrt forthwith. * - 1

We jcould get any amount of names, but deem it unneces-
sary; ;
MiJ.* MORRIS, of-IIjinois. Take ano'thefcase:
influentialand^wominent JJeijioCratSidf Blatidins-
ville, in the cftunty of MqDohough, which I also
have' the honor to represent, asked for the ap-
pointment of Mr. Jones—a gentleman whom 1
know very. well,.and. who has, been a life-long
Democrat, and is well qualified—to.the office of
postmaster of ithat thriving and beautiful-village.
Their .request wasinpt only disregarded, but
spurned, and a.Mr. Delavan Martin had a com-
mission forwarded him. This individual was
voted,for by the Administration party of the
county iu which he liyes as a candidate for the
Legislature at the...late election; and, although
three,thousand seven hundred and twenty votes
were given, nineteen hundred and fifty-two of
which were Democratic, he received the enormous
number of five. Not a man in the town or in the
precinct in which he lives voted for him, and not
a Democrat there wanted him as postmaster; yet
he was appointed, in total disregard of the wishes
of the people. Mr. Martin lives in the Blandins-
ville precinct;, and, to show the fact to which 1
refer, I will request to have read the certificate of
the county clerk:
The Clerk read as follows:
State or Illinois, McDoxouoii County, ss.
I, Isaac Grantham, clerk of the county court of said
county, do hereby certify that at a general election held in
said county on Tuesday, the 2d day of November, A. D.
1858, Delavan Martin received live votes for Representative
to the Legislature of the State of Hhnoi--, as follows, to
wit: m Pi.une City piecinct he leceived one vote ; in Ma-
comb precinct ho received three votes ; and m line pre-
cinct lie received one vote, as (lie same appeals of lecoid
in my office
In testimony whereof, I have hereto subscribed my name
ami aflixed the seal of said court, at my office in Macomb,
tliid 1st day of January, A. D. 1859.
ISAAC GRANTHAM, Clerk.
[L. a.] By JAMES VV. MATTHEWS, Deputy.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I will, Mr. Chair-
man, mention one other instance. In the city in
which I reside, containing a population of near
twenty thousand inhabitants, Captain A. Brooks
was removed from the office of postmaster, and
another appointed in his place. The Democratic
party immediately took Mr. Brooks up for the
State Senate, and the Administration party ran
the new postmaster, who had the influence of a
party nomination in his favor. The former gen-
tleman was triumphantly elected, while the latter
received in the whole distiict, including the city
of his residence, the large number of about sev-
enty-two votes; while the two other candidates
received more than eight thousand. I give these
numbers from recollection, and may not have
them exactly right; but they are substantially so.
I might go on multiplying such instances of
disregard of the public choice and interest, but I
will not detain the. committee with their rehearsal.
Those 1 have named arc only representatives of jj,"
whole class of cases in the State; indeed they pre-
sent more favorable palliations than many others.
In some instances, where none could be found in
the vicinity willing to degrade themselves below
the contempt of the people and accept positions
where they were not wanted, men have been im-
ported from abroad to take them; and I regret to
be under the necessity of adding, that some of
them did not bring very good moral characters
with them. Ifamail robbery should be committed,
there are men employed in the service in Illinois
who would at once be suspected. The appoint-
ments commenced last winter by selecting, for one
of the highest positions in the State, a man who
was notoriously a public defaulter, and was shown
to be such by the records here; a man wholly
destitute of every qualification for the office, and
who deserved a prison rather than official posi-
tion. I regiet to add that, since then, too many
of this class of persons have been promoted; too
many of these camp followers, who were required
to make war upon the men and organization of
the party, and who did it with a heartless ferocity
and an unscrupulous disregard for truth or de-
cency. Willing to sell their independence for a
mess of pottage, they supposed that .others would.0
dispose of the birthright of-freemien '&$ . cheaply'
as themselves. ■ _
It is very easy for thasg-jvbphave nocharactejr.
to lose, to assume, with theT>oldjiess of igjiQr^ice^
that others are as corrupt as thems.elvef; and lhis '
,class of venal .men in Illinois, to wliO,tti tTam.,al-
luding, stood in the-public highways, with their -
rasps in their hands, to rasp <jflf'a few spoonsful'.,
from the conscience of every man who encoun-
tered their polluting touch, and from the repu ta-,
tions of all who fled from them as from a mofal
contagion. -The whole patronage and power of ;
the Government was placed in' their hands, for (
disposal,.superadded to the corrupting appliances '
of money., in order to strike down the brave chief-'
tain of-a heroic party, and with him, that party ,
itself. ■ I have in my possession" records pertain-",
ing to-some of these men,showing th«m',to be the*
most abandoned wretches that eyer lived, but I'
will' not use them' now; hereafter I may.' fiuit
what, says some gentleman, of all'.this ? Hadnpt
the President a legal right' to remove:and to ap-,
point whajaisoever he pleased ? Grant that he had
the legal right: does it .follow' he,had a moral
right to do it? The appointing .power was con-
ferred upon him to be exercised with a sound dis-
cretion for the public benefit,and nfltf6rthepur-|
pose of gratifying personal malic'e .at the expense ,
of the public interest. Ho holds it in fr'usf for the'
people for whose benefit the offices were created,,
and not as an absolute dictatorial power, to be
exercised without reference to their wishes".'
The views and feelings of the public should be
consulted, and not trampled upon. Yet, in the
instances I have presented, and many others, not'
the slightest attention has been paid to them.;
They ure treated as though they were aliens and",
serfs in their own Government, having n6 rights!
in it. "When they petition for a redress'of giiev?'
ancus, they arc spurned as indignantly away as'
were our fathers when they petitioned the_ British
throne. The President tells you, by his" acts,
that he has the power to fill the offices; that it 13
none of your concern whom he puts in them; that
he will exercise his authority as he pleases. And
this is said by a man claiming to be a Democrat,
to a Democratic constituency! I Stand here, Mi'."
Chairman, to brand with shame such outrages
upon the doctrines and usages of-the party;. They,
are in violation of public rights, and form.noPart,
of the Democratic creed, and will be everywhere'
condemned. They are flagrant, daring, and shame-,
less innovations, which must be stayed, oi' they,
will sap the foundation of our republican insti-
tutions.
The question was asked me a thousand times,
at home, how I accounted for the course of the
President? I confess that his conduct has been
so singular, so extraordinary, so distinctly marked
by every act which can "define a tyrant," that
I did not know what response to make. " Is het
ftverncd by malignity or by imbecility?" the^peo-
e everywhere inquired. It may be answered
that both have had an agency in controlling hi^
actions. His advanced age, aided by his aristo-
cratic characterand intense hatred of Judge D'ouft-
las, has led him to gratify that hatred, and to
sacrifice every interest of his administration, until
it has sunk, in the esteem of the country, below
the point of resunection. Suppose he,does dis-
like the Senator from Illinois: is that any sufficient
justification of his course? Should he carry his
hatred so far as to strike at the people?
What injury have the Democracy of my State
done him, that lie should set his servile creatures
upon the trail of every postmaster and other pub-
lic officer there?. It is true, they were in favor.of
the reelection of Judge Douguas; it is true, the
delegation m Congress voted against forcing Kan-
sas into the Union under the Lecompton consti-
tution; it is true, we voted against the bill known
by the name of the English bill, which was gotten
up by seveial gentlemen who had no very good
right to prescribe a ney party creed, when Le-
compton, pure and naked, was voted down. But
should such things, right as they are in them-
selves, and past as they are as issues, form a just-
ification of his conduct? Not only the Lecompton,
but every other policy of his administration has
failed. His measures are but the sport and de-
rision of Congress, and his very recommendation
