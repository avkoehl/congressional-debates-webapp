Vogdes, the left to General Ames. I feel quite sure of a favorable result, no matter in what force the enemy may be, and I confess I can hardly believe the constant reports of his overpowering numbers, but think that 6,000 to 10,000 will amply cover the limits of his strength.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. SEYMOUR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: I have directed Colonel Henry to keep in front of you constantluy a company of cavalry as patrol, the commander of which should communicate with you. The object, of course, to give the earliest possible information as to any movements of the enemy, which, however, is not anticipated at this moment. Should he advance in force it is not my intention to meet him at the present position in which our troops are placed, but to fall bakc to Jacksonville, which is being rapidly prepared for that purpose. General Ames' brigade arrived yesterday.
