Since closing my letter I am informed by the quartermaster of this district, and it is corroborated by the conversation I have had with the general commanding the department, that the want of funds has rendered his army miserably inefficient; that the three regiments but lately ordered away go without clothing, tents, or proper supplies of transportation, without a dollar to pay their debts, leave with their families, or give themselves a comfort on the way; that officers ordered on recruiting service cannot accomplish their mission, because they have not a dollar to pay their expenses of transportation, and steam-boats and stages refuse to give them passage; that the teamsters this day about starting with Colonel Moore's regiment have abandoned their wagons because they will not leave their families destitute, and the Government has no means to pay them; that money to some extent has been borrowed from citizens who have loaned it free of interest, and that has long since been exhausted; that the Government credit is far below par; that the certified accounts for quartermasters for articles purchased for the Government and now in their possession are selling at 50 cents on the dollar, and that the Government credit is so low that immense prices are charged for everything that has to be bought, and if remittances could be made all these inconveniences could be avoided. Let me urge upon you to remedy, if possible, these evils. By doing so you will save large amounts of money and render this military department such more efficient.

Respectfully,

F. R. LUBBOCK.

BY THE GOVERNOR:

PROCLAMATION.

To the PEOPLE OF THE STATE OF Texas:

Whereas, on the 30th day of December last you were called upon by General Orders, No. 1, issued from the adjutant-general's office, to hold yourselves in readiness to march at a moment's warning in defense of your lives, liberty, and property, I trust you have heeded the order then given and that you are now prepared to serve your country in this hour of peril and need. I am just in receipt of a requisition from the War Department, by order of the President, for fifteen regiments of troops for the war, being the number that will be required
