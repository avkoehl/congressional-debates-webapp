ROME, GA., October 12, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

I telegraphed you before we left Decatur and of first hearing of Hood's movement. The rebels have been foiled thus far in their efforts to do serious mischief. The whole army is concentrating here, leaving garrisons at Atlanta, &amp;c., and Beauregard seems to be aiming toward the Tennessee at Bridgeport or above. I can hardly believe he will be so foolish, but such is the information. Garrard's cavalry was left at Atlanta and only the infantry of the corps is here. Please let me hear from you.

Brigadier-General.
