GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 274. Washington, August 7, 1863.

I. The following is the maximum amount of transportation to be allowed in the field:

To headquarters of an army corps, 2 wagons or 8 pack animals.

To headquarters of a division or brigade, 1 wagon or 5 pack animals. To field and staff of a regiment, 1 wagon or 4 pack animals.

to every 3 company officers, 1 pack animal.

To every 12 company officers, 1 wagon or 4 pack animals.

To every 2 staff officers not attached to any headquarters, 1 pack animal.

To every 10 staff officers not attached to any headquarters, 1 wagon or 4 pack animals.

To every 16 non-commissioned officers and privates, 1 pack animal. To every 80 non-commissioned officers and privates, 1 wagon or 5 pack animals.

The above will include transportation for all personal baggage, mess-chests, cooking utensils, desks, papers, &amp;c. The weight of officers' baggage in the field, specified in the Army Regulations, will be reduced so as to bring it within the foregoing schedule. All excess of transportation now with army corps, divisions, &c., will immediately cause inspections to be made, and will be held responsible for the strict execution of this order.

Commissary stores and forage will be transported by the trains. Where these are not convenient of access, and where troops act in detachments, the quartermaster's department will assign wagons or pack animals for that purpose; but the baggage of officers or of troops or camp equipage, will not be permitted to be carried in the wagons or on the pack animals so assigned. The assignment of transportation for ammunition will be made in proportion to the amount ordered to be carried.

II. Cavalry horses are often broken down or injured by permitting the riders to carry extra baggage. Cavalry officers will be held responsible for the immediate removal of this evil.

The knapsacks of infantry soldiers will also be frequently inspected to see that they are properly packed and that nothing is carried in them except what is directed by regulations and orders.

III. In ordinary marches, where the troops can receive daily issues from the trains, they will be required to carry only two days' rations; but in the immediate vicinity of the enemy, and where the exigencies of the service render it necessary for troops to move without baggage or trains, the men may be required to carry with them from eight to twelve days' rations, as follows:

For eight days.
