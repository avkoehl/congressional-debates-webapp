HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF UTAH,Camp Douglas, Utah Ter., September 22, 1864.

Respectfully referred to the department commander, with the recommendation that if practicable a detachment of cavalry from Fort Churchill be stationed at or near Austin until after the November election. From my knowledge of the people of Austin and the emigration this year from the East, as well as from the character of the petitioners, I have no doubt that the interests of loyal citizens and of the Government would be subserved by such military protection as is asked for. I have at present under my command no available troops for that purpose.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
