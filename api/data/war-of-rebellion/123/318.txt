AUGUSTA, ME., August 7, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Our enrollment made; contains name, date of birth, and residence, and organized into companies by the election of officers. Regimental organization not completed. Will this enrollment answer? When companies are called out for draft the other facts can be obtained. Do you want full copies of enrollments, including name, &amp;c., furnished your Department? Will the method and form of drafting and the officering of regiments and companies be under the laws of the State or under regulations of the Department? The companies for the fifth regiment are already organized and will be in place of rendezvous by the 15th.

Organize the fifth regiment, if it can be done, before the 15th. Recruit the old regiments as fast as possible. The draft will be a strong inducement for volunteering.
