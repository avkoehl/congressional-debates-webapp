HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENTS OF WASHINGTON,June 25, 1863-7. 45 p. m.

Colonel C. R. LOWELL, Commanding at Poolesville:

Your dispatch just received. The object you are to have in view in patrolling will be to prevent crossing the river by spies and blockade runners, and watch carefully for all approach of the enemy in force. If guerrillas or irregular cavalry show themselves near your line, if you can do so with reasonable prospect of success, pursue and attack.

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff, Assistant Adjutant-General.

BALTIMORE, June 25, 1863-9. 30 p. m.

Major-General COUCH, Harrisburg, Pa.:

I have telegraphed General Milroy to exert himself to the utmost to get here speedily with all the troops he has with him. Under General Hooker's direction, I am to move all the force I can to Frederick.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, June 25, 1863-9. 30 a. m.

Major W. M. ESTE,

Aide-de-Camp, Bloody Run, Pa.:

You have not telegraphed. Report your movements and action. Hasten Milroy.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.

HARRISBURG, June 25, 1863.

Major-General SCHENCK, Baltimore:

It is impossible, at this moment, to withdraw Milroy from his post in the mountains. He has to remain and fight where he is.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

BALTIMORE, June 25, 1863-11. 15 p. m.

Major-General COUCH, Harrisburg, Pal.:

In their present un-supplied, disorganized, and necessarily ineffective condition, I fear Milroy's men, if you keep them where they are, will only come to grief. I desire to get them straightened up, reunited with the other parts of regiments and companies now with General Tyler, and used to add to the force I am sending to Frederick, under orders from General Hooker. I will submit the matter to the General-in-Chief.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.
