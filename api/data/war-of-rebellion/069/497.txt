HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,June 2, 1864-9 a. m.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: The skirmishers of Bates' brigade were pushed out to the cap of the woods at daylight. The line of battle was at Faehtz's fence and is again being placed there. The skirmishers from the Maryland Brigade are ordered into the tall pines. I am about to relieve the skirmishers from this division who are in front of the artillery on my right. Will you please order those troops to throw out line to replace them?

Very respectfully,

S. W. CRAWFORD,

Brigadier-General.

The enemy is in force in the heavy timber in front of the present picket-line, having a battery in position in the cap of the woods. We connect on the left of the picket-line with the Eighteenth Army Corps.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
