HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,April 9, 1865.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding U. S. Armies:

GENERAL: I sent a communication to you to-day from the picket-line, whither I had gone in hopes of meeting you in pursuance of the request contained in my letter of yesterday. Major-General Meade informs me that it would probably expedite matters to send a duplicate through some other part of your lines. I therefore request an interview, at such time and place as you may designate, to discuss the terms of the surrender of this army in accordance with your offer to have such an interview, contained in your letter of yesterday.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
