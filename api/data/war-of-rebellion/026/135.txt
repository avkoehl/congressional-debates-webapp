Officers killed.- Lieutenant Edward D. Sawtell, Sixth Massachusetts; Captain Rowley P. Taylor, One hundred and thirtieth New York.

Mortally wounded.- Colonel Charles A. Knoderer, One hundred and sixty-seventh Pennsylvania.

SUFFOLK, January 30, 1863.

Three of Follett's guns have arrived; two of them disabled by inability to get shells down; one of his limbers exploded. Our loss about 100. My extra force had arrived at the latest; also Colonel Foster. The enemy had fallen back from 3 to 4 miles since daylight, contesting different positions. I have repeatedly guarded against being led too far away in case of success. It has been a hard night and day, but I feel sure that we have a victory. One of the churches has been prepared for the wounded.

Prisoners say that battery horses were nearly exhausted and the guns wee moved by hand at intervals. Some guns will probably the secured.

JOHN J. PECK,

Major-General.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe.
