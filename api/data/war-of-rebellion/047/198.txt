By command of General Beauregard:

JNO. M. OTEY,Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 14, 1863.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Nothing worth reporting since yesterday. Enemy still working hard on Morris Island batteries. I intended attempting to drive him off the island last night, but, for reasons to be communicated by letter, it could not be done. The defensive there must reluctantly be adopted, prolonging contest as long as our available means will permit. I shall fortify Fort Johnson and Sullivan's Island strongly as practicable. Brooke and 10-inch guns are indispensable for that object.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 14, 1863.

D. B. HARRIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief Engineer:

COLONEL: Upon reflection, it is better not to destroy anything about the Marsh Battery, as we may still complete it after having finished the Shell Point Battery.

Instead of constructing those two field batteries near Legare's for two pieces each, make them large enough for four pieces, to be supported by rifle-pits and four companies of infantry to each battery. Afterward we will construct in that vicinity one or two mortar batteries against Black Island.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., July 14, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel D. B. HARRIS,

Chief Engineer Department, Charleston, S. C.:

COLONEL: I gave you this morning the probable armament of those two batteries near Legare's; since them I find we have some guns on siege carriages which I wish to substitute for the field guns already referred to. You will, in consequence, make those batteries accordingly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General, Commanding.
