PULASKI, January 26, 1864.

Major R. M. SAWYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

My forces still hold Athens. Have got all my train out. I think I will be able to whip them there. Mooresville has been notified. They should push down so as to protect my working parties south of Athens and a force posted at the junction of the railroad. The enemy crossed at Brown's Ferry. The cavalry that went to Florence are aware of the movement, and will endeavor to get in rear; the few at Athens stood up like men.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, TENN., January 26, 1864.

Lieutenant G. M. BAILEY, Columbia:

Colonel Mizner will have to attend to defense of bridge. I do not think you need fear any attack. Enemy has been badly whipped at Athens, and are now in full retreat toward Brown's Ferry. Captain Adm, of Ninth Illinois, after two hours' fighting, whipped Colonel Hannon, who had 600 men and two pieces of artillery.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

Captain FEENEY, Prospect:

Send communications to Captain Taylor direct, in the party 2 miles south of you. Tell Taylor if he is not strong enough to fall back to you, but to hold out if [he] can get a good position. Put all forces in position and hold Elk River at all hazards.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel Spencer, my chief of staff here, gone down. We must hold the enemy until Phillips can get in their rear. If you have mounted men send them to the support of Captain Adam, Ninth Illinois.
