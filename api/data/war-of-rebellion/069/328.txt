line, and that it is only a skirmish with sharpshooters. The enemy show no great force in their entrenchments, which seem to be refused at the point of connection between this corps and Sixth. General Wright's headquarters are at Overtown's, and the telegraph is being run there.

Brigadier General SETH WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of to Potomac:

GENERAL: I have received the dispatch in reference to the Sixth Corps, and have referred it to Major-General Birney for an immediate answer. General Birney, who had just left here before receiving your dispatch, remarked to me that the Sixth Corps had wasted hours in getting in position. It is a self-evident fact that the Second Corps have had a sight [sic] for the last twenty-four hours without change, expect that the skirmishers on the extreme right have been advanced toward the enemy to develop his position, as the Sixth Corps did not arrive.

General Warren reports that is attacked on his left flank. The general commanding directs that to relieve Warren you attack wherever you can find a point suitable for it.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

I find that General Barlow's skirmishers have not fallen back to this side of the stream. The report that his skirmishers had retired was incorrect. They had been ordered to fall back, but did not do so until the orders was countermanded.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
