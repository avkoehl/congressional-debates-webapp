JACKSON, April 22, 1863.

General JOSEPH E. Johnston, Tullahoma, Tenn.:

Heavy raids are making from Tennessee deep into the State. One is reported now at Starkville, 30 miles WEST of Columbus. Cavalry indispensable to meet these raids. The little I have is in the field there, totally inadequate to prevent them. Could you not make a demonstration with a cavalry force in their rear?
