THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 5,
States Well, sir, I will not deny that such em-
barrassments exist When ray constituents come
here to memorialize Congress through me their
Representative, that they at ^suffering under pecu-
maiy difficulties, I will not stand up here to deny
the fact I will not pretend to know their own
business better than they know it themselves No,
sir, I rather sympathize with them in their dis-
tress, and will cooperate in every measure which I
may deem expedient for their ielief But when
this disti ess is not of a local, but a general nature,
when it pervades not one district of the country
only, but the whole country, I must entertain my
own opinion as to its causes It is not, sir, that I
have any want of respect for the opinions of the
gentlemen who have instructed me Some of them
1 know personally—many of them 1 know by
reputation—and 1 will not pretend to put my judg
mentin comparison with theirs Butouropimons
do not always depend upon ourselves, nor can we
change them as we will
I know, sir, that in having refused to obey these
instructions, 1 have exposed myself to the attacks
of those who will be ready to assail my motives,
and to denounce me as the hneling instiument of
a party I shall endeavor to bear up against all
such attacks, with that equanimity which it be-
comes every public man to exercise in the dis-
chaige of those duties which must always, more
oi less, subject him to reproach But if the gen
tlemen who have condescended to mark my course
upon this floor for reproof, and to instruct me in
my duty heie, shall suppose that I am insensible
to their wishes, or that I have lightly and incon-
siderately disregarded them, give me leave to say
they will do me a manifest injury If motives of
selfmteiest had dictated my conduct, I should
have pursued aveiy different course No man,
sir, can envy me the position in which 1 have
placed myself, by disregarding these instructions
I have been obliged to go counter to the wishes of
many valued personal friends Alone, without
legislative experience, I have been obliged to op-
pose myself to my colleagues in office—to a dele-
gation, which, in point of abilities, of eloquence,
of learning, of every liberal and manly accom-
plishment, will not suffer m comp&uson with that
of any other State upon this floor, and with whom,
whatevei difference of political sentiment there
may be between us, I shall always esteem it an
honor to have been connected m the discharge of
my duties here But there aie considerations above
ill feelings of peisonal affection, and peisonal le-
aped And if, aflei having deliberately foimed
my opinion upon a great question of public policy,
after having maintained it for a king time thiough
evil report and through good repoit—having ie
fused to give it up in piospect of office, or rather
having made thehbeity of acting freely upon it the
condition of accepting office—aftei all this, I could
basely yield it up in appiehension of loss of office,
I should sink myselt in the estimation of those
very men who have now, as I think, somewhat
unwarily, I will not say unkindly, urged me to
do it.
I believe the House will do me thejustice to say,
that I have not very early intruded myself upon
their notice And, now that I am up, I will detain
them with only one or two íemarks more I
should be the last man to infringe upon the free
dom, or even the latitude of debate, on this floor
It is due to the representatives of the people, as
well as to those who sent them here, that they
should have the right of discussing all questions
of public policy, and the conduct of public men,
with a perfect freedom and plainness Asafuend
to the institutions and the rulers of my country,
I would not shrank from any attack that might
be made on the principles of the one, or the con-
duct of the other If they cannot stand attacks,
if they cannot bear discussion, let them go down
together, and be consigned over to the ignominy
and contempt of mankind But wmle everything
must be yielded to the light of discussion on this
floor, something may be expected of gentlemen,
if not on the ground of courtesy, at least upon the
score of decency and selfiespect And if they
will undeitake to orand the rulersof their country
with all tne epithets which the phiensy of a mad
ambition may suggest, they must be content if
they only render themselves ridiculous, instead of
injuiing the object of their attack
I     Especially would  it  become those who have
I themselves been denounced as maintaining doc
| tunes subveisive of the fundamental pi maples of
i this Government—doctrines tending to anarchy,
sedition, and civil war—to exercise a little charity
towards those who differ from them in the con-
j stiuction of constitutional questions, to leaui a
little moderation at least, if not humility, from
their own sad expeuence     It was a rule with the
ancient critics, that m his fictitious representations
the poet shoald make the language used by his
characters correspond with their situation
" 1 elephus el Feleus, < urn pauper et ex ul, merque,
ProjK.it ampullar et sc«quip diiia veiba,
Si emit cor opectanti , tetegi^e querela "
But in the theatrical declamations upon this
floor, this ancient rule seems to have been wholly
foigotten if the gentlemen who have maintained
those doctrines would condescend to bring down
their language to con espond with the position they
occupy in the eyes of the American people, we
should be much more likely to be affected by their
arguments
But, su, if it were true, as has been often as-
serted here, that a Tiberius a Caligula, or a Nero,
did in reality preside ovei the destinies of this
nation, instead of the Chief Magistrate who now
sways its councils with so much vigor, he would
not be thus deiounced and he'd up to public
teprobation Before such an event could happen,
ihe spirit of Ubeity would have departed fiom this
House and from this nation 1 he suppliant ac-
cents ef slaves would have been substituted for
the bold language of freemen, and we should no
longer deserveoui libeity, foi we should not have
the couiage to assert it Such was the case in
Rome, under Ctesai, in England, under Cromwell,
and in Prance, undei Bonaparte
But, if gentlemen will still have it that they aie
suffering undei the evils of despotism, if,-in spite
of all the ribaldry and party abuse which is daily
suffered to be poured forth against the rulers of
their country, they will still insist upon it that they
are subjected to the sway of an arbitiary monaich,
1 have one thing more to say Piom my soul 1
abhor despotism in all its foitn By feeling, by
education, by habit—in common, 1 tiust, with
eveiy citizen of this Republic—I loathe the veiy
name of despotism, in whatever alluring garb, or
in whatevei specous shape it may be piesented to
my view But bad as it is, and deeply as I should
deprecate its remotest approaches to the rulers of 11
my country, theie is one thing, in my opinion, '
still woise,and still moie deeply to bedeprecated
that is, a subjection to a pioud moneyed aristoc- I
lacy If it should ever be my misfoitune to choose
between them, I should not be long in making up |
my mind Aftei having tued every expedient that
patuotism could suggest or piudence dictate, to
| cvoid the evil, if, af ei all, the calamity could not
be averted, 1 would say,give me the man who has
laisel himself to power, although it be upon the
luins of the liberties of his country, but who, at
the sime time, has encireied that countiy with the
glories of an illustrious name—who has stamped
the impress of his own genius upon her arts, her
arms, and her laws, and who has laised her up to
be the admiration and tenor of the world, give me
him, tyrant, usurper, despot, thougn he be, rather
thanasubj ction toaproud moneyed anstociacy,
who have no ambition above the level of their own
soidid trade, who make then power the pander of
their avarice who oppiess their country when hv
ing, and who, when dead, leave no other memori-
als of their inglorious existence than the sighs, the
teais, and the gioans of their fellow citizens
Mi Speaker, I have finished all 1 intended to
say in presenting this memorial It has been a
very painful duty to me, sn, for the first time that
I ever had the honor of addressing any legislative,
and, I may add, any public assembly, to be obliged
to stand up heie in defence of my own conduct
But circumstances have compelled me to do it, and
if I have trespassed too fai upon the indulgence of
the House, my peculiar situation must form my
apology But if, m the sentiments I haveutlered,or
in the language I have used, I have been betrayed
by too much waimth of feeling into expressions
which may seem to some to bear too hardly upon
my political opponents,! can only say, I trust the
House knows how to distinguish between personal
and political hostility     For the former, I shall
offer no excuse, for I feel that I need none Piom
I the latter, I do not wish to be considered exempt
I But we may all of us have something to forguund
forgive The angry clouds which nave been so
long gatheung in the national sky have flashed
their terrific lightrwigs athwait this Hall, and
involvtd Ub in the hoi roí s of the tempest But the{,e
I temporary convulsions of the elements may, per-
haps, be but the salutary pur fixations ot oui polit-
ical atmospheie, and though now the fears of the
timid may be excited—though clouds upon clouds
may close in the prospect, at d settle down upon us
in the gloom of an impenetrable right, yet, ere
long, the light wil break forth—the thunders will
die away in the distant honzor, and the mild
evening star of peace and conciliation rise over
these tioubled waters of stufe And when wego
foith to behold the wiecks of the storm, though
we may, perhaps, find some old oak torn up by
the roots, or even a whole forest laid piostrate by
the blast, though the 1 tbois and the habitations of
men may have been swept away by theviolence of
the tempest—we shall find, if I mistake not, all
nature reviving in fresh vigor and beauty, we shall
find our liberties safe, the Constitution unimpaired,
and the great principles of freedom springing up,
in luxuriant abundance, over the whole land
