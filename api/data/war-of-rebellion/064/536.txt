HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,New Orleans, June 24, 1864.

Brigadier General N. B. BUFORD,

Commanding District of Eastern Arkansas:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 19th instant, and to inform you in reply that your action and the orders given by you to Captain Hunter are fully approved. I am also authorized to say that trade stores will not be allowed on this river, except at points where there is at least a regiment of troops, and boats will not be allowed to land at points other than military posts, or under the protection of gun-boats. Admiral Porter's orders on the subject are now very stringent, and the naval commanders will co-operate with you fully in breaking up contraband trade.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DE WITT CLINTON,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp, A. A. A. G.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

Complaint is made to me that General Brown does not do his best to suppress bushwhackers. Please ascertain and write to me at once.

A. LINCOLN,

President.

WARRENSBURG, MO., June 24, 1864-8.30 p.m.

Colonel GEORGE H. HALL,

Sedalia, Mo.:

It is reported from Knobnoster that there is a band of bushwhackers, numbering 100, 2 miles north of that place. It is probably untrue, yet I desire that you will be on the alert for them. Advise the citizen guards of the report, and the party of 40 passed south between here and Holden last night. Send 100 men to the Knob with orders to move in such direction as may be found necessary. Look out for Dresden and the eastern railroad towns.

E. B. BROWN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

KNOBNOSTER, MO., June 24, 1864. (Received 8.25 p.m.)

Colonel McFERRAN,

Warrensburg, Mo.:

One hundred bushwhackers 2 miles north of here in timber. What shall I do?

B. F. POE,

Commanding.
