CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                           as
tiemen may talk as they wal about the right of pe-
tition, and all that, but the very fact which the Sen-
ator from Vermont has stated, proves mcontrover-
tibly to my mind, that this question is solely and
wholly one of power and aggrandizement, to which
politics, religion, morality, and patriotism are all
subservient, I repeat, sir, that it is a struggle for
power—I cannot view it otherwise. I did not in-
tend or expect to have said so much
Mr. PRENTISS said that he entirely concurred
m the representation which his colleague had made
hi relation to the state of public opinion in Ver-
mont. He had no doubt that the public mind had
become much more agitated, and that tne number
of those disposed to favor the views of the petition-
ers had greatly increased within a year or two past,
and he had as little doubt that the increased excite-
ment on the subject, and consequent accession of
strength to the abolitionists, as they were called,
had arisen, m no inconsiderable degiee, from the
course which had been pursued in this and the
othei House in relation to the petitions which had
been presented to Congress How had the peti-
tions been treated here' At one time they were
received, and then ths prayer rejected mstanter,
without a hearing, without consideration This
mere formal reception, followed with an immediate
and instantaneous rejection of the prayer of the
petitions, the people ot the Noith had regarded as
trifling with their rights, as substantially a refusal
to receive the petition , and, consequently, a denial
of the right to petition More recently the form
had been changed Now, a motion to receive was
necessary, which was immediately followed by a
motion to lay that motion on th  table Now, said
Mr P to the plain common sense of the people of
the State he represented, this proceeding was
nothing more or less than a refusal to receive the
petitions. It was this infringement of a constitu-
tional right which had done much to agitate the
public mmd Many who had signed petitions were
influenced mainly by that consideration Their
purpose was to assert and maintain the r.ght to
petition, and they would persist m sending peti-
tions heie until that right w as fully recognised, by
treating the petitions with the same respect as peti-
tions on other subjects are treated.
Mr NILE8 remarked that he had nu wish to
prolong this debate, or to participate m it His
only object «as to put himse'i right, and explain
the reasons which would influence his vote He
considered that the Senate had, during the last
regular session, by inattention, falten nito a course
of disposing of these petitions inconsistent with
their deliberate decision made wo jears ago, alter
long debate At that time, a petition pia}ing for
the abolition of Slavery in this District was pie-
sented by the Senator from Pennsjlvama, (Mr
Buchanrn,) and the Senator fiom South Carolina
(Mr Calhoun) objected to its being received, and
moved that it be not received This motion was
debated for several weeks, and finally decided
against the motion, or, that the petition be received,
by a xeij large majority It was then moved that
the prayei of the pptit.on be rejected, which pie-
vailed also by a large majority Whilst this
motion was pending, and the discussion going on,
other similar petitions were offered, and the luce
motion made, that they be not leceived, and it was
then moved that that motion be laid on the table
which w as adopted But this was not considered
as a final disposition of the petitions, but only a
temporary disposition of them, until the question
under debate was decided These petitions, how-
ever, were not afterwards called up This tempo-
rary disposition of this class of petitions two years
ago, seems to have led to a similar course the
last session as a final disposal of them
Mr N said he did not hst session vote to lay
the motion to receive a petition on the tab'e, as a
final disposition of the petition, as he considered it
equivalent to a vote to refuse to receive the peti-
tion He regarded it as only an indirect w ay cf
excluding petitions A petition cannot be received
when objected to, without the consent of the Se-
nate. A motion is made to obtain such consent,
and that motion is indefinitely postponed, or, what
is equivalent, is laid on the table, with the undei-
standmg that it is not to be taken up again    Of
course, the petition is not received, it cannot be
received without the consent of the b«dy, and that
consent is not given, but is virtually refused
He could not give his sanction to a proceeding
of this kind, which seemed to him to be in direct
violation of the solemn and deliberate decision of
the Senate two years ago He had no objections to
such a disposition of these petitions as was made
two years since, to receive them, and then reject
the prayer, or lay the petitions on the table. Still,
in his opinion, a different course would be prefera-
ble We all have the same object, we only differ
as to the means of attaining it We all desire to
allay the excitement on this subject, to quiet and
tranquillize the public mmd, and to stop a course of
proceedings which can do no good, and tend to
much m schiet In an-,wer to the inquiry which
had been made as to the state of public opinion on
the abohtu n question at the North, he was souy
to say that the spirit of abohtten appeared to be ex-
tending He did not think it was nicieasing much
in his own Slate, but lhcu0ht it was spieading in
many of the eastern Siatcs In a recent e'ection m
a neighboiing State, the candidate foi ths Chief
Executive office of one party, and the pievaihng
one, was understood to be an abohtioni t, and this
seems to have been legardedasso far a recommen-
dation that the candidate ot the other paitj wis
induced to publicly declare that he was m favoi ot
abolishing slaveiy in this District. From the 
facts, he infened that abolition opinions of some
son prevailed veiy extensively in the St?te icleiied
to. If he was mconect, the gentleman from M is-
sachusetts could set him right The couise pursued
the last two years in legard to abolition petitions,
does not appeal to have checked that spint, hut
from that, or some cause, it has increased, an 1 he
believed it would be wiser to refer these petitions,
and obtain a sound, candid, but strong repoit, set-
ting forth the reasons against abolishing si iv< n in
this District <Vre we to presume ¡hat the pc >ple
vrill not be influenced bv facts by reasons and ai-
gumentst We ate a thinking and a reisoning peo-
ple, and all our institutions and all our rights re«t
uii public opinion He did not despair that even
this delicate and difficult question might be settled
and put at rest, before the great tribunal of public
opinion
Mr STRANG-E expiessed his regret that this
discussion had arisen he regretted, also, to hear it
asserted that the abolition principle had ex-
tended itseK, but h  thought that that encums'anoe
was no sufficient reason (or letciv ng the pe it ons

was made by Congress on the n^ht of petitioning,
this excitement was not in exis. ence, it had been
laised and created by the opposition, by the resist-
