He directs that you throw your bridge immediately, and cross without delay. I am also directed to say that your delay in reaching the river has retreated the operations of General Warren more than two hours, and that this delay calls for explanation.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

In reply to your note, besides the fact that General Prince is very slow, the distance too this ford from my camp is 4 miles farther than General Warren's, who, I believe, was up to Mountain Run. I can easily explain the delay on these two grounds. I have been on the ground for for over an hour, endeavoring to urge the leading division.

Respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I will cross the remainder of my command at once, and move on toward Parker's Store. Captain Cavada tells me that Warren has not yet crossed. I suppose he will have done so by this time. I cannot communicate with him unless he does. Gregg is on my left. My headquarters will probably be near the rear center of my command. I will endeavor to inform you more minutely
