RICHMOND, VA., March 28, 1862.

Governor BROWN,

Milledgeville, Ga.:

Your arms were taken by mistake and distributed to various points. They cannot be recovered, but I have ordered General Pemberton to replace them from others expected from Florida.

GEO. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Pocotaligo, March 28, 1862.

Brigadier General MAXCY GREGG,Commanding Fourth Military District:

GENERAL: The major-general commanidng wishes me to say to you that it would be well for you to notify the planters in the vicinity of Ashepoo River [Champman's fort] that as spring approaches the troops in that section will be compelled to fall back to a more healthy region of the country, and the guns at Chapman's fort will be removed to some other point, as necessity may require.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. R. WADDY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Pocotaligo, March 30, 1862.

General, S. COOPER,Adjutant and Inspector General:

GENERAL: I have the honor to transmit the two accompanying papers,* received through Brigadier-General Lawton, in relation to certain arms represented by his excellency the governor of Georgia to have been seized by Confederate officers in Savannah, the arms being the property of the State of Georgia.

The Secretary of War directs that if the arms were taken, as charged, that they be restored. It will be seen by General Lawton's letter, that, having been shipped to various and distant points, it is impracticable to recover them. I request further instructions on the subject.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Savannah, March 31, 1862.

His Excellency JOSEPH E. BROWN,Governor of Georgia:

SIR: It has recently been brought to my notice that there is at present a large amount of cotton stored in and near Augusta, and it has been suggested to me that an expression of the intention of the commander of the military department to have this cotton destroyed rather than allow it to fall into the hands of the enemy might have a beneficial effect
