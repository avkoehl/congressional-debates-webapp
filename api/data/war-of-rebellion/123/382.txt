WASHINGTON, D. C., August 14, 1862.

(Via Columbus, Ky.)

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Memphis:

The policy of the Government to permit gold and silver to be paid for cotton within our lines was determined before I came here, and I must carry it out. Both the purchasers and sellers are subject to military surveillance and control, and all suspicious persons can be kept away from our armies. Moreover, where you have good reason to believe that money in the hands of any individual is intended for the use of the rebel Government you can seize it. It, however, would be absurd to prohibit the payment of our money for cotton in Memphis while General Butler is encouraging such payment in New Orleans.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Governor YATES,

Springfield:

If your Sixty-eighth Regiment or any others of the short term will enlist for three years and remain where they are, I will let the enlistment date back to the original muster, and pay them the bounty. This has been proposed and accepted by the Ohio regiments, but they cannot be discharged until other troops come to take their place.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Governor YATES:

The 35,000 volunteers will not fill up your quota of volunteers and militia and fill up your old regiments. Thirty-four thousand seven hundred and nineteen are required to fill up your old regiments.

Governor MORTON,

Indianapolis:

After to-morrow bounty and advance pay will not be paid to any except those who enlist to fill up the old regiments, or to complete regiments not entirely filled.
