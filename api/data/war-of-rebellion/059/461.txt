HENSAL, Chief of Scouts, Decatur:

Try to get a man out east of Flint to work around in the rear toward Day's Gap, and see what is coming into the valley from that direction.

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. FOURTH DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Decatur, Ala., April 23, 1864-9 a.m.

Brigadier-General DODGE,

Athens:

A large force was found encamped on the Danville road last night at the foot of the mountains, 5 1/2 miles out. This morning scouts report the trail of a heavy force had crossed last night toward the Moulton road. Patterson sends a flag of truce on the Moulton road, dated at Oakville, 22nd, asking to exchange 7 prisoners for a like number in our hands. I direct Captain Pollock to say that we have no prisoners, but will receive our men, if he chooses to release them, and send him an equal number when we have them. I think the flag of truce is a trick. Their forces are certainly growing larger.
