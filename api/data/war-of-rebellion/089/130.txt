HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864.

General GRIFFIN:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to inform you that Colonel Dana has pushed out his skirmish line on the right, opposite to Fort Howard, driving back the enemy to their works, where they appear to be in considerable force. They have fired volleys of musketry at our men, and yell them from their works. This portion of the line has advanced as far as it can go under present instruction. Have you anything new in your front?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to General Ayres.)
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864.

Brigadier General CHARLES GRIFFIN,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The following is furnished for your information: Two prisoners from Sixteenth North Carolina, Scales' brigade, Wilcox's division, sent in by the Fifth Corps, state all the brigades of Wilcox's division are on this side the Appomattox. Scales' and Anderson's, formerly of Field's division, are not far from the lead-works, while Lane's and McGowan's, they say, are some distance off on their right, with Heth's division. They represent the cavalry to be connecting with their right. Thomas' brigade, when they last heard of it, was north of the Appomattox. This was some time ago. Thomas and Anderson are represented to have exchanged. This disposition of the troops agrees with the statement of the two deserters from Lane's brigade, sent in yesterday by General Parke. Prisoners received to-day report that Scales' brigade was sent to Richmond during the recent operations near that city and have only returned within the last three days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
