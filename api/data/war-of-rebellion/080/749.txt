At 11 o'clock last night took breast-works at Howlett's house. Other portions of same line were retaken. Pickett's division now occupies trenches from Howlett's to front of Clay's. Field's division is no the right, but I believe whole of front line not occupied. Battery at Howlett's is being re-established. Saw five vessels sunk by enemy in Trent's Reach. Behind lie the monitors; counted ten steamers within the reach. Enemy made two attacks last night on Beauregard, but were repulsed, with loss-400 prisoners, including, 11 commissioned officers captured. He has not entirely recovered his original position. Some fighting has occurred there this morning without result. Have ordered railroad at Port Walthall, destroyed by enemy yesterday, to be repaired and reopened.
