For recommendations of measures tending to the greater efficiency of the Medical Department you are respectfully referred to the special report from this office called for by circular dated War Department, Adjutant-General's Office, October 7, 1865.

In conclusion, I desire to bear testimony to the ability, courage, and zeal manifested throughout the war by the officers of the Medical Department under all circumstances and upon all occasions. With hardly an excepting they have been actuated by the highest motives of national and professional pride, and the number who have been killed and wounded bears most Honorable testimony to their devotion to duty on the field of battle.

To the medical directors of armies in the field and of military geographical departments especial praise is due for the successful execution of their arduous and responsible duties.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. K. BARNES,

Surgeon-General, Brevet Major-General, U. S. Army.
