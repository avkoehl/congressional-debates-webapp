HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-4 p. m.

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: General Ayres' advance now sees the White Oak road near W. Dabney's for three-quarters of a mile. There is a difficult swamp between the plank road and that place. I have now a continuous entrenched line from my right across Griffin's front, and along the plank road nearly down to Gravelly Run. If General Humphreys can take charge of Griffin's front, about 500 yards west of plank road, with the return down it, I can take my corps and block the White Oak road.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

MARCH 30, 1865-4.50 p. m.*

General WEBB:

A portion of Wilcox's division made a demonstration against Griffin about twenty minutes ago, and were easily driven back into their lines. We took a few prisoners-broken-down men lately forced into the service. They don't know much, but think Johnson's division moved to their right when they came down this morning. General Heth is here, but they do not think his division is. They think Heth commands the corps, and Hill all the defenses south of the James.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 30, 1865-7.10 p. m.

(Sent 7.25 p. m., received 7.30 p. m.)

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

Your dispatch dated 5 p. m. has just been received. Please find out and telegraph if possible what brigades of Wilcox's are in your front. What grounds have those men for thinking more of his brigades than their own are there?

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 30, 1865-8.15 p. m.

General WEBB:

To-night when the sun was about an hour high I ordered General Griffin to advance his whole line of skirmishers to demonstrate the practicability of an assault upon the enemy's works. I have not yet received his report.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
