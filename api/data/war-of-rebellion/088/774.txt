HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, September 10, 1864-2 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

General Mott reports at 1.30 a. m. that he has carried the enemy's rifle-pits and is establishing his line on the crest near the plank road. It was done by the bayonet. He has a few prisoners and is reversing the line.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS, September 10, 1864. (Received 1 p. m.)

General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

About 3 this morning the enemy attacked the right of my new picket-line, recapturing the picket-pits to the plank road. From that point I hold and have reversed their line for about half a mile to the left of the road. I occupy the crest at the Chimneys. At this point the enemy's picket-pits are about fifteen yards from ours and I anticipate war to-night. There was some bad management in placing the right of the line last right. It was intended to fill up the enemy's pits there and make a new line along the edge of the ravine, but the regimental commander extended his line down the ravine, which subjected him to a flank attack. I believe I sent up about 90 prisoners. My own loss in killed, wounded, and prisoners is about 40, I hear, though it may be less. Lieutenant-Colonel Meikel, Twentieth Indiana, was severely, if not mortally, wounded. Picket-firing is sharp there to-day.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

(Same to General Warren.)

Both divisions have large details still at work cutting timber in front of the rear line. The picket-line in front of the advanced works on the plank road was advanced last night to the position heretofore held by the enemy. About 80 prisoners were captured.
