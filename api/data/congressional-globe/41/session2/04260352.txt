Appropriations for the Navy—Mr. Morgan.
41st Co3stg....2d Sess.
ral $7,000; but unless duty in the Navy Depart-
ment is sea service the amount is overestimated
in the sum of $1,000. We next come to rear
admirals. The Department estimates $35,000,
which is an underestimate, the true amount
being $40,000. The next estimate is for com-
modores. The Department estimates $78,400,
which is also an underestimate, the amount
required being $80,000. ■
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I wish
to ask the gentleman from Ohio a question.
Mr.' MORGAN. I have no time to spare,
but I will hear the gentleman.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Wisconsin. I wish
to ask the gentleman from Ohio whether these
estimates were not madennder the last Admin-
istration ?
Mr. MORGAN. I esteem my honorable
friend from Wisconsin ; but his question coin-
pels me to make a statement which I did not
intend to make, i am talking about abuses
in the' Government which ought to be corrected.
The gentleman talks about Administrations.
If this thing commenced in the last Adminis-
tration, the gentleman compels me to say that
it has continued up to and so far through Gen-
eral Grant's Administration. Tt exists to-day in
the present Administration of the Government.
I am sorry to say that; for although it is true,
I did not intend to make the charge. This
abuse did exist in the last Administration ; but
it exists to-day in tlie present Administration.
I do not care when it began, or by whom it
began; these are outrages upon the country,
gross abuses against the Government, which
this Congress is bound to remedy or be pre-
pared to meet the jnst indignation of the peo-
ple.
Now, Mr. Chairman, 1 desire to do the Com-
mittee on Appropriations full justice. I wish
to do injustice to no one. 'J'hc Navy Depart-
ment asked, as salaries, allowances, and trav-
eling expenses for officers, the sum of $5,000,-
000. The Committee on Appropriations have
reported only $4,000,000, cutting down the
amount asked for $1,000,000. If the commit-
tee have a sincere desire to correct these abuses
their conduct will bo applauded by the coun-
try; but the people will not be satisfied with
finely gilded words; they want economy and
reform. The appropriation asked for by the
committee is too much by more than eight hun-
dred thousand dollars, and to that extent it
should bo reduced.
My time is fast passing, and I will briefly call
attention to the result of these false estimates.
The excess of pay asked for officers on the
active list is as follows: for captain, §7,000;
for lieutenant commanders, $30,000; for
lieutenants, $217,000; for masters, $119,220;
for ensigns, $35,840; for midshipmen, $185,-
700; lor surgeons, $44,000; for passed assist-
ant surgeons, over $30,000 ; for assistant sur-
geons, nearly $"<5,000 ■ f0r paymasters, over
$49,000; for passed assistant paymasters, over
$5,000; for assistant paymasters, over $16,000;
f'or^ chief engineers, over $20,000; for first
assistant engineers, over $70,000; for second
assistant engineers, over$8,000 ; for chaplains,
over $2,000; for professors, over $4,000; for
naval constructors, over $11,000; for gunners,
over $10,000; for carpenters, over $3,000 ; for
sail-makers, over $4,000 ; for boatswains, over
$15,000. On the retired list: for rear admi-
rals, $14,000; for commodores, over $11,000 ;
for captains, over $12,000 ; for commanders,
nearly $4,000; for lieutenants, nearly $3,000;
for masters, about $16,000; for midshipmen,
$500; for surgeons, nearly $12,000; for passed
assistant surgeons, $1,500; for assistant sur-
geons, over $13,000; for paymasters, over
$9,000 ; for passed assistant paymasters, over
$700; for assistant paymasters, $700 ; for first
assistant engineers, over $3,000; for second
assistant engineers, $200 ; for chaplains, over
$2,000; for boatswains, $1,400 ; for gunners,
nearly $4,000; for carpenters, $5,000; forsail-
makers, nearly $3,000.
So recklessly extravagant was the estimate
of the Navy Department that the Committee
on Appropriations felt called upon to reduce
it to $16,641,845, making a reduction of
$7,956,432. The appropriation proposed for
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1871, by the
Committee on Appropriations is $16,641,845,
while the amount of appropriation for the fiscal
year ending June 30, 1870, was $15,326,246 ;
showing an excess in the appropriation pro-
posed by the committee, in the present bill,
over the appropriation for the year ending June
30, 1870, of $1,315,599. The estimate of the
Navy Department for pay and allowances of
commissioned and warrant officers, and for
traveling expenses, was $5,000,000.
Mr. MISTERS. Will the gentleman allow me
to make a remark here?
Mr. MORGAN. I cannot yield. I would
need two hours instead of one to expose the
abuses of which I am speaking, and I am as-
tonished that any gentleman should desire to
interrupt the exposure.
Mr. MYERS. I am astonished that the gen-
tleman is not willing to be corrected.
Mr. MORGAN. I have said that the esti-
mate of the Navy Department for pay and
allowances of commissioned and warrant olli-
cers and for traveling expenses was $5,000,000,
and I have shown what is the amount, actually
needed according to the law of the land.
The amount required for pay of officers is
$2,970,237. The number of officers entitled
to receive rations at $10!) each and those
doing duty in what is called sea service is
twelve hundred and ninety-one. The rations,
then, for twelve hundred and ninety-one offi-
cers, at $109 each, would be $140,719. The
amount for traveling expenses, the whole
amount asked for, is $80,000. These three
sums make the total amount necessary as the
appropriation for the pay of officers for rations
and for traveling expenses $3,190,956 ; so that
the amount asked by the Secretary of the Navy
for this purpose is $1,809,044 in excess of
what is really necessary. The committee in
this bill propose for the above-named purposes
$4,000,000; while, as I have shown, the actual
amount needed is only $3,190,950, so that the
committee propose to give $809,044 more than
is necessary. Now, while the gentleman on my
right [Mr. Washiiuhx, ofWisconsin] must have
approved of this. I desire to do him no injustice;
and I have this to say, that the Committee on
Appropriations had a right to take the estimate
which came from the Secretary of the Navy as
being correct. They had a right to presume that
when the head of a Department put in an esti-
mate of what was required for various services,
where the amounts were fixed by law, it would
be in accordance with the law. All that the
committee did was to presume that the esti-
mates were true ; but they turn out to be false.
If the amendment which I propose to offer
should be accepted it would effect a saving on
what is proposed by the committee of nearly
a million dollars. A saving ! Ah! sir, we are
apt in this House to forget what saving means.
But if we forget the people do not. The tax-
payers know what it means. And in the name
of the tax-payers whose rights have been vio-
lated : iu the name of the people whose taxes
have been lawlessly taken from the Treasury
by means of false keys ; in the name of a
wronged and outraged people, I demand that
these abuses shall be corrected.
To show the utter bad faith with which Con-
gress has been treated I wish to call the atten-
tion of the committee to another fact. In
order No. 175 issued by the Secretary of the
Navy it is distinctly stated that the one third
extra allowance which had been given without
authority of law, in flagrant violation of the
express provisions of the law; the Secretary
declared that that one third extra did not
apply to midshipmen and mates; and why?
Because their pay had been increased; but yet
we find that in the estimate used by the gen-
tleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Washburn] there
was asked an increase of thirty-three and one
third per cent, to the pay of midshipmen and
mates. This demand was made, although it
was expressly excluded by the order making
the illegal increase—that audacious order
issued during the last Administration, but the
abuse has been continued in this.
Let us look for a moment, and only for a
moment, at this matter of pay. I was taken
to task by the gentlemen from Pennsylvania
[Mr. Kelley and Mr. Soopield] when, in the
early part of this session, I denounced to this
House that the Treasury was being robbed.
And I still say that robbery it is. If you
take money illegally from the Treasury it is
robbery morally, whether it be technical rob-
bery or not. If you take money illegally from
the Treasury you rob the people, no matter
whether it is, technically speaking, robbery
or not.
Mr. Chairman, here is the statute which
declares that the salary of the Admiral is
$10,000. Here is the Naval Register for 1870,
a copy of which is sent to every member of
this House. The Naval Register says that the
salary of the Admiral is $10,000. But what
salary has the Admiral been receiving? More
than thirteen thousand dollars ; the excess
over $10,000 being paid in pursuance of order
No. 175. It is now pretended that the Secre-
tary of the Navy has the right to increase the
pay of officers. If he has the right, then Con-
gress has not. Congress has said that the sal-
ary of the Admiral should be $10,000; but
the Secretary treats Congress with contempt,
usurps legislative powers, and pays the Ad-
miral and all other officers one third more than
the law allows.
We are told by gentlemen who stand here in
defense of these abuses that the pay of naval
officers was small, and that therefore the Sec-
retary of the Navy was justified in increasing
it. I hold in my hand the Naval Register for
.1860, which shows that attliattime the highest
salary paid to any naval officer was $4,500.
We find by the Naval Register for 1801 that
they advanced a little. Their approaches on
the Treasury were. skillfully made, and we
find that in 1861 the highest pay of an offi-
cer, that of an otlicer commanding a squadron,
had been increased from S4,500 to $5,000.
\Vc advance now to 1862, and then, for the
first time in our history, we find in our statutes
the title of "admiral." You have been lately
told by a distinguished citizen who holds a
high position, the General of the Army, for
whose genius as a general and whose gallantry
as a soldier I entertain sincere admiration—
you were told by that General in a letter, not
addressed to you, but to a committee of the
Senate, that England did more for its generals
than the United States. 1 believe that had
General Sherman been an Englishman instead
of an American he would have been made a
duke. It would have been in accordance with
the spirit of monarchical institutions. Eng-
land has a monarch. I thank Almighty God
the United States have not yet.
Sir, if. has become fashionable to hold up
the monarchies of Europe as models for our
imitation. The gentleman from Maine [Mr.
Hale] has referred to the vast navies of Eng-
land and France ; but he forgot, to tell us that,
France keeps up a standing army of one mil-
lion men to keep the people down. And it
behooves the people of America to beware
how they follow in the footsteps of monarch-
ies, lest the day be not distant when large
armies will be maintained to keep them down.
These titles of rear admiral, vice admiral,
and admiral are but progressive steps toward
