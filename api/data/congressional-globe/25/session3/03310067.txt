Defalcation of Samuel Swartwout—Mr. Taylor.

propriety suppose they desire to elect a blacking
committee, to subserve party purposes They
will not, of course, expect my vote for any such
ooject, and neither shall I sanction the unjust im-
putations cast upon the Speaker, by voting with
t! em to take fiom him, on this occasion, the ap-
pointn g power I have no want of confidence in
the Speaker, believing that a committee selected
in the usual mode Will be composed of men who
will faithfully and impartially investigate the sub-
ject leferred to them, having in view the protection
of the public interest and the promotion of the
public good.
But, sir, investigation of particular frauds upon
the Treasury will avail but little, unless we tuin
our attention to the remedy for these evils
The gentleman from Vnginia [Mr. Wise] tells
us there is no remedy but 11 a change of the Ad
ministration, turn out the present incumbents of
office, and put in a new set "Why, sir, this has
been the object and unremitting effoit of the party
to which that gentleman belongs, !or these many
yeais It is to get into powei by any available
means, and they would fain mane the people be-
lieve that if the pure, immaculate Whig party
should succeed, then all would be light But I can
tell gentlemen you may turn out, and put in, until
doomsday, and unless you change the system of
collecting and keeping the public money, and
remedy the defects of law, defalcations will hap-
pen, so long as man is depiaved, and subject to
temptation. And.m the language of the message
of the President, the recent defalcations "furnish
'the strongest motive foi the establishment of a
' moieseveieandsecuiesys em fot tne safekeeping
' and d.sbursement of the public moneys than any
' that has heretofore existed " Sir, it seems to be a
piominent part of the policy of the Wing party to
chaige upon the admmistiation of General jack-
son and Mi Van Buren, all the defalcations that
have happened since the organization of the Gov-
ernment And [ was somewhit surprised to hear
the gentleman fiom Virginia [Mr ¡VKsov] speak
of the alarming defalcations of the last nine years,
confining himself to that peuod,as though little or
nothing of the kind had occuned before Sir, i
have turned my attention to the celebrated docu-
ment (INo 111) which has been so fieely, and I
may say unfauly, used to convey this impression,
and it is from this that I will show how unfounded
and unjust is the charge 7 his document contains
a s'atement of amounts due from collectors of cus-
toms and receivers of public moneys, who were
out of office on the 12th October, 1837 None
of these, therefore, are chargeaole to the present
Administration The aggregate amount due fiom
collectors of the customs, since the organization of
the Goveinment to the 12th October, 1H37, as ap-
pears by this document, is about $1,445,000 Of
this amount, I find about §211,324 standing against
dates within the period of General Jackson'a ad-
ministration, excluding those cases asceitained to
be defaulters within the month of his first inaugu-
ration, and therefore not justly chaigeable to his
Administration. Of this amount, the indebtedness
of Mr Ingersoll, the district attorney of the east-
ern district of Pennsylvania, and that of Mr
McCulioch, collector of Baltimore, known to be
balanced, make in the aggregate §91,244 and
■should therefore be deducted, leaving $,120,080.
Indeed, it appears, from this same document,that
a suit was ordered agamt Mr Ingersoll for the
amount stated in the table, but that judgment was
obtained for only $3,985 78, which has been paid,
and Mi. McCulioch never was a defaulter to any
amount There are several others of this class
whose indebtedness has been i educed in whole or
m part, oi have offsets to the claims against them
and others, against whom the security is consid-
ered ample We have not, at present, the means
of knowing piecisely the amount paid and secured,
but it would not be too high an estimate to rate it
at fitly or sixty thousand dollars, leaving the esti-
mate of loss by collectois, during the eight years
of Geneial Jackson's administration, at sixty or
seventy thousand dollars It is to be piesumed
that the baknces which have stood on the books
of the Departn ent, uncanceled for the past ten
yeais, (ficrn the time General Jackson came
into office,) constituting an aggregate of about
fcl ,233,000, are not, to any considerable amount,
secured, and therefoie a large proportion may be
considered as lost In making an estimate of the
relative amount of defalcation and loss sustained
under different administrations, it is proper to
take into account the amount of money collected,
and we find the aggregate of leceipts from cus
toms, dunng the first-four years of General Jack-
I son's administration, was about eleven millions
\ more than during the teim of his immediate prede-
cessor It then, sir, appears by this celebrated
document, when carefully examined, that the
amount oí loss fiom collectors of customs, during
the eight years when General Jackson adminis-
tered the Government, will not much exceed one
third of the average amount for the same number
of yeais in all the preceding Administrations since
the organization of the Government1 And it may
not be unworthy of remark that, as I understand,
not more than two or threeof these collectors who
are defaulters were originally appointed by him,
and the balances against them are small.
As to the balances which appear in this docu-
ment against public receivers, the same remark
will apply as to such as have remained uncan-
celed for nine or ten years Most of these may
be consideied lost, while of those that have oc-
curred since that time, a large proportion have
been paid or secured, so that it is believed not
more than two hundred thousand dolíais may be
consideied doubtful, being much less in amount
than the loss sustained under previous adminis-
trations The whole amount of receipts fiom the
sale of lands since they were fust bi ought into mar-
ket, is §94,737,913, of this sum about nxty millions
were sold under General Jackson's administration,
I and in one year a laiger amount than the aggie
gate of any twelve veais preceding Heie, then,
I the companion axam results most decidedly in
I favor of General Jackson's administration, and
I if defilcatiors are to be considered as authorizing
the charge of " corruption," gentlemen would do
well to considei on whose head the chaige might
fall with greatest weight Certainly not upon the
head of the venerable Jackson
So much, sir, for this celebrated document,
which the gentleman fiom Virginia [Mr Wise]
moved to have reprinted man extra number, to be
again sent out to the public, a document which,
all now admit, does great injustice to many
worthy and honorable men, who never have been
m íeahty defaulters to the Government, but whose
accounts, not having yet been balanced at the De-
paitment, they were reported as they stood upon
the books, in conformity to a call of this House
And, sn, tms list of defaulters, without any dates
showing when the defalcations occurred—calcu-
lated, nay, designed, to give a false impression—
was, during the late political contest in the State
of New York paraded m every Whig newspaper
throughout the State, and posted up in evei y bar-
room m the country, undei the head " sub titas-
mors" Mr Speakei, if these are sub tieasurers,
I would ask, to what system is the teim applica-
ble byway of repioach' Why, sir, they belong
exclusively to your bank deposit system, foi these
defalcations aie all connected with that system,
have all occurred under it, and I had almost said
grown out of it, they have all happened while the
public deposits were made either in the Bank of
the United States or the State banks, and under
those laws and regulations for collecting and keep-
ing the public money which have long existed
And it is a question of the highest moment, and
worthy the deepest consideration, whethei the
bank-deposit system, and present defects of ¡aw,
have not essentially contributed to a deterioration
of public morals, in the strong inducements which
are offered to specuhtion, and the temptations
which are presented to the eye of avarice, without
any adequate counteracting influence, and it is a
question of no less importance to determine,
whether the indulgence heretofore given to any of
the depositories of the public money, to use it for
banking or any other pui pose, is not a violation of
that article of the Constitution which declares
that " no money shall be drawn from the Treas-
ury except m consequence of appropriations by
law"
The suspension of specie payments by thebanks,
then- refusal or inability to pay ove' the vast
amount of public deposits which they held, and
the consequent financial embarrassments of the
Government, producing a necessity for convening
Congress to provide the means of carrying on the
oidinary operations of the Government, induced
the Piesident carefully to examine this subject,
and to recommend a radical change in the system
of keeping the public moneys. And one of the
most important features in the system pi oposed,
was the prevention of the use of the public money
for any purpose whatever, except those objects
for which it had been collected from the people,
and appropriated by law This great constitu-
tional measure forms one of the prominent, and I
may say, most important points at issue, between
the friends of the Administration and its oppo-
nents So long have the banks been profited by
the use of the public money, that they have com e
almost to claim it as a right, and to piopose to
deprive them of this source of profit and specula-
tion, and to leave them, as you leave other inter-
ests, to stand upon their own foundation, you are
told at once that you are " making war upon the
banks," and the Opposition are found íallymg to
a man against the measure ' At the last session
of Congress, when a bill from the Senate, entitled
"An act to modify the last clause of the fifth sec-
tion of the depositad of June 23,1836, and for other
purposes," was under consideration, a member
from South Carolina [Mi Campbell] moved an
amendment in these words: " *lnd provided, also,
' That nothing in this act shall be so consti ued aa
' to authorise the use of the Government deposits for
' banting puiposes " Upon this question every
Whig member present voted against the propo-
sition, and evei y Democratic member in its favor;
and 1 remember well, sn, that you had the honor
of giving the casting vote in favor of the amend-
ment
Here, su, was presented the naked question,
whether the banks should use the money collected
from the people as capital for banking, to be loaned
out to merchants, speculators, and favorites, or
whether it should be regarded as a fund belonging
to the people, and to be used only for those pur-
poses for which it had been collected and appropri-
ated by law The position of parties on this ques-
tion made it quite evident on which side that power,
which consults chiefly its own pecuniary advant-
ages, would thiow, in the main, the weight of its
influence It was not expected that the class of men
who are most benefited by the use of the public
money, would yield to a pimciple which was to
deprive them of so gieat an advantage, without a
desperate effort And, aocoidmgly, we have wit-
nessed one of the most violent and bitter political
contests which this country has ever experienced,
a contest in which the power of money, the influ-
ence of associated wealth, and the combined effoits
of that class of men whose selfish and exclusive
inteiests were to be subserved in this matter by
the success of the Whi°; paity, operating with ac-
knowledged ingenuity and skill upon all the e'e-
ments of opposition, were too apparent to escape
the notice of the most careless and indifferent
observer Doubtless, sir, it may have been good
party policy to keep out of view as much as
possible this important question, and to thrust for-
ward other topics more available for electioneering
purposes, such as " the dangers of the purse and
the sword in the hands of one man," " the alarm-
ing increase of executive patronage and power,"
terms that may do very well as catchwords to be
played upon atan election, but which, in reality,
have no meaning whatever when applied to the
system proposed for collecting and keeping the
public money Let this question be well under-
stood, divested of the rubbish thrown around it to
keep out of view the true point at issue, let the
people see what motive could have moved to such
an unwonted zeal a certain class in the piesent
political contest—what could have induced that
extraordinary and profuse liberality which has
poured its thousand and tens of thousands into the
party tieasury, constituting what has been tiio^t
aptly termed " a coituptton fund," to carry an
ekction, and let gentlemen meet this question fairly
upon its true merits, upon the broad question
whethei the use of the public money, by corpora-
tions or ¡ndn uluals, foi any ourpose whatever ex-
cept as it shall be appropriated by hi', ctn be
longer permitted without endangering the pabha
