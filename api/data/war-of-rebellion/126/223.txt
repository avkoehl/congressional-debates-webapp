or of soldiers, whom employed in making up army clothing relieved from dependence upon public charity.

These depots were supplied with material from the three principal depots of New York, Philadelphia, and Cincinnati, and their operations were confined to the making up of such material into garments.

Such depots are established at Quincy, III., and Steubenville, Ohio.

The quality of the clothing and equipment furnished to the Army has been excellent; very few complaints of inferior quality have been made, considering the immense quantity of material which has been issued to the troops. The marches made from Atlanta to Savannah, and from Savannah to Goldsborough, by armies which during their marches had no opportunity to replace articles of equipment worn out, are evidence of the good quality of the shoes and clothing with which the Army is supplied.

Of the principal articles of clothing and equipage the following quantities have been purchased and manufactured at the three principal depots during the fiscal year ending June 30, 1865:
