There is nothing new from Foster. Sheridan in person is in Kautz's camp at Gill's Landing. The head of Sheridan's column is just passing these headquarters. Kautz has not commenced crossing that we know of. His orders are to await the arrival of Sheridan's column.

DEEP BOTTOM, July 26, 1864-9.45 p.m.

General WEITZEL,

Acting Chief of Staff:

All is quiet on my front now. My pickets hold the same position as when I last informed you. About dark two regiments advanced on the extreme right of the picket-line below the creek, but were opened on by the artillery and picket-line and retired in haste. The columns have not yet arrived. General Sheridan is at my headquarters. I will keep you promptly posted on all that transpires.

Respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

A new pontoon bridge is about to be laid over the Appomattox at Broadway. Arrange your transports at once, so as to interfere the least possible with this bridge, and if possible let it not be disturbed at all during the next thirty-six hours.

G. WEITZEL,
