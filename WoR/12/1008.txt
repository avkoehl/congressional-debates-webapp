Major Williams states that the enemy could not have passed the point where he struck the Hanover road more than an hour before he reached there. Captain iRoyall wished me to state that he had verbal orders to resist any force which might approach his position. This was in addition to the written instructions from General Williams. In reference to the movements of General Emorys command in pur- suit I learned nothing more than what was contained in his report and in the report of Colonel Rush, except as to the movements conducted by Maj. IR. Morris, whose report I inclose. It may not be improper for inc to state that the officers of the Fifth Cavalry evinced some discontent because they had been made to turn in their carbines.

Ijoined the advance of my cavalry at Old Hanover Court-House about 10 oclock in advance of the infantry, when I went on soon after to Old Church. I received at that time various orders from various persons to hold my own and maintain my position; to watch careftilly in front and rear;~~ not attack a superior force, & c. The enemy was supported b~ infantry, no doubt. His force was, in addition, one or two brigades of cavalry, with some artillery. I tol- lowed his trail at daydawn yesterday, sometimes on two roads, to Tun- stalls Station, having found that the White House depot was safe. I arrived there about 9 oclock.
