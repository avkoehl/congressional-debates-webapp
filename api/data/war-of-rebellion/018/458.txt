Major-General POPE,

Commanding:

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA, Washington, July 7, 1862-12.10 p. m.

Major-General BANKS,Middletown:

As soon as you approach your position near Serryville send forward the whole of your cavalry and a battery of artillery, under General Hatch, to make a night march upon Culpeper Court-House and the crossing of the Rapidan, so as to save the bridges over Mountain Creek and the Rapidan, on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad. General Hatch had best make his headquarters at Culpeper Court-House, with you whole cavalry force, or nearly so, posting strong pickets to Orange Court-House and at least 20 miles in front of Culpeper toward Richmond.

I understand by dispatch received by Colonel Beckwith from you assistant adjutant-general that your command is to remain two day-at Front Royal.

This delay would derange all my operations, and therefore I desire that you move forward to the point designated with as little delay a possible.
