General LIDDELL:

We require more tools. Will send off horses and wagons by first boat to-night. Enemy has established himself in heavy force from the extreme left to the right, and has heavy batteries along his whole line. The works are not complete on the left.

General LIDDELL:

Enemy in position from the bay across D'Olive's Creek toward Durant road in heavy force. Will know more in the morning. My force is busy on the defenses. Have received no more subterranean shells. Many of those planted have busted. Commissary building nearly done. I am going to develop the enemy at daylight if my information is not full to-night.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

General LIDDELL,

Blakely:

Drove in the enemy's skirmishers this morning at daylight, capturing guns, knapsacks, and blankets. They ran back to their log-works and appeared in a strong and extended line of battle. We had several men wounded. Several launches discovered sounding in the cove below. The guns will drive them away.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

General LIDDELL:

All quiet. Enemy still developing on my right and left flanks. He is putting up a battery upon my left. I am doing all I can to get Huger and gun-boat to open.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.
