COMMANDING OFFICER WALLACE'S CROSS-ROADS:

CAPTAIN: A spy has given information that the enemy contemplates an attack on Knoxville to-morrow morning at daylight. He reports they will cross the Clinch River above Clinton, probably between that place and the mouth of Powell's River. The major-general commanding directs that you watch most vigilantly to-night all the approaches across the river from Clinton to the confluence of Clinch and Powell's Rivers. If any advance of the enemy is made you will immediately send couriers to Maynardville and Blain's Cross-Roads, reporting the fact to our forces at those points and also to headquarters at this place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Major General E. KIRBY SMITH, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Major Harper sends this dispatch:

General Forrest three days ago was within 4 miles of Nashville. He has burned several railroad bridges; captured and killed 125 Federal soldiers; has three commissioned officers captured, and is now at McMinnville.

Major Harper is ordered by General Forrest from Crossville back to McMinnville and by General McCown to Athens. He obeys General Forest's order. The officer bringing the dispatch says the artillery captured was near Bon Air Springs, 5 miles east of Sparta, protected by 75 or 80 Rangers, and that Forrest would make a stand at McMinnville.
