HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 9, 1863-10 a.m.

Colonel INNES,

Military Superintendent, Nashville:

Your dispatch is received. We cannot spare the cars to Louisville now. Before you send troops or equipments, you must send first of all forage, and then beef-cattle, of which the army is in great need. We must also get overcoats and blankets for the men, who are suffering very much for the want of them. The general commanding fully approves the views expressed in your dispatch. Communicate this to Colonel Scott.

J. A. GARFIELD,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Chattanooga, October 9, 1863.

Colonel HODGES,

Nashville:

Horses are dying for want of forage. Many are turned out on the north bottom to shift for themselves. It is more important to send forage than troops here now. This army, unless things improve, will be anchored, for want of stout artillery and ammunition horses soon. A great oversight was not sending to Bridgeport grain in abundance as soon as the army retired to this place. Get it forward now, and accumulate also at Nashville.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.

Colonel HODGES,

Nashville:

It is supposed the Western troops will move by Corinth and bring their own transportation.

M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General.
