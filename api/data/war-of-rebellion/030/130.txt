Major-General THOMAS:

Have and keep your troops in readiness to move at a moment's warn- ing, with 100 rounds small-arm ammunition, five days' rations, three in haversacks. All who cannot march in each company to be left organized, armed, under an efficient officer, with regimental subordinate officers in charge of the baggage, which, except two tents to each company, will be packed in the wagons, and parked defensively and regularly for each division, each regimental train distinct, tent wagons to be together, so that no difficulty will occur when they are sent for. Each regimental command will encamp by its own train, and be responsible for it.
