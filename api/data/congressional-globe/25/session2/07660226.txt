Suppression oj duelling m this I) sirid—Mt. iWe?
Senate.
II    detenre ut their interests The whole ten-
riencj ol ibis infamous system ot espienage and
calumn) has been carried on for the benefit of the
idling classes, mostly to enable them to live on the
mdustn of others It is the idlers andlazy dmoluies
that feed upon the calumnie;, vomited iorth here by
these miserable scribblers
To show how perfectly reckless these hired
uiiteis are, and destitute of both respect and truth,
a statement was made bat a few weeks smee, con-
tained in die " Boston Atlas," a paper, b}-the-by,
somewhit distinguished for retailing such stuff, that
the members of this House had absolutely commit-
ted a robbery upon yeur Sergeat at-arms. Yes, sir,
that jour members of Congress had purloined fiom
the oiiice of the Sergeant-at-arms between $2,000
and $2,500, the amount of which has since been
found to have been, retained by the Metropolis
Bank, and has been accounted tor, about which nut
one word had yet been said by anj single membei
of this body No, sir, no proposition lot commit-
tees, no investigation proposed to purge the House
of this foul deed, and its perpetiators After all
tins, an attempt now to get up one upon such
vague and indefinite charges,and upon such flimsy
and wietched authority, I confess, sir, to my inind,
carries with it something more than meets the eye,anii
can but acknowledge my being totally at a loss to
account (or the zeal that has charactei i/ed sentleme, n
III  the institution of thii paUiculai investigation I
again repeat it, according to m\ humble estima-
tion, such investigations can result m nothing less
thm dieter, humiliation, degiadation and dit,-
gtace I am opposed I o a'l and every investigation
about moial chuacter, believing that that alom
belongs to ihose'coii-utuents who send us here, bc-
foie whom-we all haw to stand our trials belore
coming into this bod) I han myself often been
met by charts emanating fiom these political sca-
vengfti, whose only vocation is to collect the foul
and loathsome scandal and falsehoods upon which the)
feed and delight in, as beixg most congenial with
then miamous and most disgraceful appetites But,
sn, though they may have sometimes succeeded in
imposing upon a iew weak and credulous peopk, I
have never known that public opinion did othei-
wise than sooner or later to overtake them
The influence, if any they have, can only be in
proportion to the intelligence oi want ot it of the
people upon whom they attempt to practice the u im-
postures Such influence is evei witheied and blighted
bv the intelligence of a fi ee people But a lew months
since, a similar charge ot corruption was made b)
the same source against a distinguished Democratic
membei of this House 1 allude to the honorable
member from Maryland [Mi MeKiM of Balti-
more,) thin whom a moie coriect, high minded
man does not live, without the least shadow of
truth, and which was acknowledged, as soon as ex-
posed by that honorable membei Yet, sir, no
proposition was made to investigate that foul and
infamous s'ander, made by one of these same ktter
vmteis fiom Washington. No, sir, not one word
was said about this bise andenraordmar) accusa-
tion agnnsi one of ■\oui most i espectable mem-
bers of tin House Then, sir, why, why was there
so much sensitiveness displaced on the present oc-
casion To me, the «hole proceeding is most un-
accountable and ex laonlinary, I do not believe
that theHouseca.i he justified in consuming Ustime
in th( discussion and piuseculions of suen investiga-
lions It is only giving to the scandal of these
hirehng vreUhrs, an importance to which thty
would nevei otherwise attain
The charges and abuse of such, I have ever
Heated with that sdence and contempt with
v/hn h 1 would the abuse of a drunken, vul-
gar bhc guird, werp I to meet one m the
streets gon x from the Capitol to my lodgings, nor
^ir, to I deem the editors of those kennel presses,
ihre ugh whose means such scandal and calumny
ji  propagated, and who co-operate and act in
concert with them, a whit better than the agents
tuey einnio) to effect this vile and infamous purposes
of btockeniaz <he character of every one who has
ton much independence, self-iespect, and pure lore
of country, to kneel with them at the same altar,
sn wor hip of the ioul author oí their filthy
idolatry
But, sir, honorable gentlemen have asked will
xiti not invistióte chargfs that are made against
members of this House? Certainly, whenever those
charges are properly made, and in a definite and
tangible foim, and founded upon a proper and le-
sponsible source, but then, in my judgment, they
should be entertained onlv on the most senous and
weight) charges, such as would justify the expul-
sion of a member from thisHou e, and, letrne sn,
it will, at ail times, be a rnoit dangerous precedent
to set here to institute inquiries into moral charac-
tei There is too great a diversity oi opinion asu>
the propel standard ot mor dm in this large and
exteu-snecountiy ol ours, embracing, as it eh   
communities ol almost everv latitude and longim If
from almost everv section c t the inhabitable glohi
speaking different languages, with diflcient teli-
gion, and, of course, of dilleieut moiaK and m in-
ncrs, even attempt of tin kind would necessinlv
meet with the greatest em ban lsvinents
Let the piecilem once he samtuuwd by this
House, and how long would it be before)on \u ild
have innun>erable petitions sent here.fiom the ,ibo-
litiomsts, pet hips, to exclude from a seat m ihi

In concluding my rcmaiks, I am aware, IMi
Speakei, that I owe an apology to the House 1 n
the siiong linguage I hive felt it my duly to us 
towards a cernm set ot individuals, but it is i \
tremely diiheult louse language truly descriptive
ot such characters, without applying the coarsest
and harshest epithets. It is mressai) to present
their odious pnctices in their ippropnalc colors to
the ga/e ol an insulted and indignant peopk , upon
whom they hive so long practised tin ir foul and
infamous impostures Sir, I have aheady dwelt
too long upon this subject 1 beg pardon ol the
House for the tune I hive consumed on the occa-
sion, and will trespissno longer upon their patience

Mi ÍNÍLES sai 1 h had not intended to siy any
thine on this sublet, h d it not been for the extn-
oi dinary remarks of the hone i able fc.cn ifoi from
Delaware, f Mi Cr evT0\,] which he had heai 1
with surprise, with pain, and the trepes* regret
Such remarks from an) member ol this body lie
could not have listened to without the most painful
emotions, but coining from the quarter they did—
fiom a re«peotable member ol the Judiciary Cora
mittee, distinguished as, a jurist and for his ioiow-
leil«e oí and respect for the common law—such
remarks from such a source, from a member of the
committee which is jus,tly regarded as the guardian
of the laws, and which' has reported this bill, he
had heard with the most piofound regret
We are told that it is m vain to pass this bill,
thm it will be useless, and worse than useless, that
it will not restiam the barbaious practice which it
is intended to suppress, whilst it may encourage
us.sissinntioii'i ind othei nets ot violence Tftis
hw, if passed, it is said, cannot be enforced, and
why not, sir' The leason assigned was one he
was sony to heai, ind which he did not believe to

lieve this I cannot enlei lain so low an estimate
of the standard of moral Jtelmg and principle of
the people ol the District He had but little ac-
quaintance with the inhabitants of the District,
hut, so i.u as his knowledge extended, he had seen
nothing to justify sueh an opinion. Are we to look
(oi the evilence oi it in the wounded sensibilities
ind die biph ion. wf moial ieeliig man festcel on €i
leteni melincholy occurrence. So far as he could
judge, that painful event had produced as severe a
shock to the moral sense of the people heie as it
had thioughout the whole country "Whilst he con-
i lined wnh the Senator fiom Delaware, that the
seventy ol the punishment might increase  the diff-
cnltv of enforcing the law,still he could not believe
that this law, should it be passed, could not be cte-

The great object, and one which he rcgaided as

of loe (joveinmem, was to secure the independence

serve the confidente of the nation This confidence
