GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to inform you that the attempt made by Colonel Capehart's brigade to destroy the railroad was not successful, as the fires were not large enough nor properly kept up. The general commanding directs that Colonel Capehart's brigade renew work on the road in the morning, and directs that you give this work your personal attention.

Very respectfully,
