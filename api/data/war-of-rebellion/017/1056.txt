cavalry picketing the river. No enemy seen on opposite side of river, except what was moving up toward Sulphur Springs. A good ford about 3 miles above railroad bridge. Kearny is at Warrenton Station, picketing to Bealeton. No pickets extending from Pope's this way, and no efforts to keep up communication. The removal of his cavalry diminishes the means. Morell is near Morrisville, with Griffin at Barnett's. Sykes 2 miles to the rear, with Warren at Barnett's, to take Griffin's place when he goes to Kelly's. I shall go to Barnett's, then Kelly's, and on return give such intelligence as I can gain. Water is very scarce on the road; insufficient for large commands. Regiments have 40 rounds 2 wagons each; brigade headquarters, 1; division headquarters, 2. Will give full report on return. Four companies of Rhode Island cavalry at Rappahannock Station last night. Telegraph advances very slowly, too slowly. More picks are said to be wanted, and wire.

General BURNSIDE:

Dispatch of 10.30 received. General Halleck is misinformed in regard to Reno's location; he is not at Kelly's Ford, nor can I hear of him. No one but four companies of R. I. cavalry are at Rappahannock Station - at Bealeton. This was the last information received. Have sent to Bealeton to get information, and shall start Sykes at daybreak for Rappahannock Station or its vicinity. The Sixth New York occupy Barnett's, and are on opposite bank. I think they can hold and watch that point with the addition of a Dutch battery; but if there is a battalion of infantry available, without breaking a brigade, I think it well to put it there to-morrow. Shall leave Griffin there. Reynolds has gone, and like Reno, is beyond reach. This portion of my corps would have been one day farther forward had I had any information of Pope's forces or the enemy.

General BURNSIDE:

I am ordered to move direct to Warrenton Junction, and to push the command at Barnett's, &amp;c. The enemy have struck with their cavalry the railroad near Manassas. I expect to be out of reach of you, and you must keep back trains, &c. If you can push up ambulances, I want them much. Your animals will have to rely on grossing; there is no grain.

Major-General.
