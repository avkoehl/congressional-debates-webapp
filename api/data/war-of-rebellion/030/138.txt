GALLATIN, December 8, 1862

Major-General ROSECRANS:

General Dumont being evidently too ill to take the field, and as it is of the greatest importance that the railroad communication should be preserved with Louisville, I propose to place Ward's brigade under General Paine for the purpose of guarding the road from Mitchellsville to Nashville, and the Fortieth Brigade, Colonel, Miller, under General Reynolds, giving him two brigades to cover the front of this place until I can concentrate the other four divisions of my corps at or near Nashville or as I would recommend, near Lebanon. The enemy will use every exertion to damage the railroad, and they should be prevented, if possible. I will submit a plan of future operations by mail to-morrow for your consideration.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General

[DECEMBER 8, 1862.]

General THOMAS:

Your proposed plan for the detail is approved. Garesche will send your orders. Proceed at once to carry it out, and concentrate Fry's division for movement as soon as practicable. How long will it take?

ROSECRANS.

[DECEMBER 8, 1862]

General ROSECRANS:

If I hear of Hall's arrival at Hartsville to-morrow, I can concentrate Fry's division the day after. Paine being here, Reynolds asks to have a command in my First Division.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

[DECEMBER 8, 1862]

General ROSECRANS:

Reynolds has just come in, and says he would prefer the two brigades. Hall's and Miller's. Send the cavalry to-morrow.

GEO. H. THOMAS,.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Nashville, December 8, 1862

Major-General THOMAS, Gallatin:

All right. Will send the cavalry day after to-morrow.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, December 8, 1862

Major-General THOMAS:

The general thinks your first proposition best. In the emergency of an anticipated movement to-day, he assigned Hamilton to command Negley's and Palmer's divisions here. Palmer's will have to stay here,
