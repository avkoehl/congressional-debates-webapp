General WEBSTER,

Nashville, Tenn.:

Tell General Meagher if he will get any department commander to make application for him I will order him to report. There is surely work for all, but the trouble is to get men placed. Unless he can do this I have no orders for him. He might see General Thomas or General Schofield.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, November 5, 1864-10 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

The superintendent, Mr. Taylor, reports this morning 250 cars between Chattanooga and Kingston, bound south, detained by small accidents. These cars should be detained in Atlanta till a sufficient number arrive, say 500 in round numbers, to make everything perfectly safe and sure to clean up the entire road to Chattanooga. General Steedman should be directed to come with his troops and the balance of the stores immediately, bringing 250 cars. We propose that the whole 500 cars reach Atlanta before any trains be started back to Chattanooga. Our superintendent, Mr. Taylor, thinks he can work out your idea. Answer, if this meets your views, in order that there may be concert of action.

L. C. EASTON,

Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

General EASTON, and

Colonel BECKWITH,

Atlanta, Ga.:

Your dispatch received. It will not be possible to furnish cars as you wish, as so many are being given for the transportation of General Schofield's troops, but will be sent as fast as possible.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ATLANTA, November 5, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I believe that I have now in the commissary depots at Atlanta everything we will require for the trip.

Chief of Commissary of Subsistence.
