Brigadier General J. P. HATCH,

Commanding Northern Dist. Dept. of the South, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: After a careful examination of the questions invoked the major-general commanding is of the opinion that all property contraband of war which was found in Charleston at the time that city was captured by the U. S. forces was captured with the city from hostile possession, and should, therefore, be turned over by you to the authorized agents of the Treasury Department. He regards all naval stores as contraband of war and directs that in obedience to General Orders, Numbers 88, from the Adjutant-General's Office, War Department series, of 1863, and the orders of the Secretary of War, dated April 19, 1865, a copyof which was sent to youin my letter of the 3rd instant, you turnover to Simeon Draper, esq., special agent of the Treasury Department, all captured naval stores in your possession. Any previous orders inconsistent herewith are hereby countermanded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
