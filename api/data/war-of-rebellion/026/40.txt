bank in the rifle-pits. Some of our horse got over. The river was high, not favorable, and filled with obstructions, so that they could not bridge it under fire. Our loss, 1 killed and 11 wounded. Enemy's loss considerable.

General Ferry's demonstration is having the effect of drawing troops in that quarter, so that on the whole line we shall greatly benefit General Foster. He reports the river all blocked with trees and other obstructions; long lines of rifle-pits heavily lines with sharpshooters. Brigade of cavalry had arrived at Ivor. This last was reported to me by a man I have, and is confirmed. Has not crossed. Sharp firing now.

Franklin has been heavily re-enforced. Pryor at Carrsville on Tuesday, and remained with 5,000 infantry, with his advance near Holland's Corners. Spear is at Carrsville watching the flank of Ferry. This corroborates my information sent you from deserters and contrabands. Firing in direction of Zuni.

Memorandum of understanding between Captain Flusser and General Foster, December 6, 1862.

1st. Captain Flusser to furnish pilots for the Chowan River to the army transports.

2nd. On the 11th to be in the Upper Chowan with one or two gunboats; more gunboats if he can furnish them. These are to be re-enforced by two or more army gunboats, to be under Captain Flusser's command.

3rd. To communicate with Major-General Peck, commanding at Suffolk, by means of parties sent from Winfield. The letter to be so written that if it falls into the hands of the enemy he will think that the attack is to be made on the Blackwater in earnest instead of being a demonstration. The word "co-operate' will express this idea to General Peck in speaking of your assistance. This letter must be sent at once. The general impression to be given to those who may communicate to the enemy is that a serious attack is to be made on the Blackwater.

4th. The coal-schooner to be brought up by Captain Graves is to be sent back Roanoke Island as soon as the immediate wants of the gunboats are satisfied.
