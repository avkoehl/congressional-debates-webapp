SIR: Dr. Stephen Hagadorn was sent to Richmond as prisoner of war with a number of others. There were no papers to show that he differed from the rest. The inclosed papers contain all the information there is about him. Doctor Hagadorn has always adhered to the same statement.

Let the prisoner be released on parole and allowed to go to the United States.

OFFICE OF THE MAYOR OF THE CITY OF NASHVILLE, October 8, 1861.

[Sub-inclosure No. 1.]

BATH, STEUBEN COUNTY, N. Y., September 11, 1861.

Hon. J. C. BRECKINRIDGE.

MY DEAR SIR: Although an entire stranger to you I have taken the liberty to inclose to your address a letter to General Winder, of the C. S. Army, asking for the release of a prisoner he now holds and which I beg of you as an act of humanity and a favor to me to forward to Richmond, if in your power. I ask the favor as a political friend and a national Democrat, relying upon your generosity and kindness of heart. A perusal of the inclosure will explain its object. To satisfy you of my identity I also inclose a note received F. H. Hatch,* the collector at New Orleans, with whom I am connected by marriage and was in correspondence until the present difficulties and through [whom] I would make this application if I knew how to reach him. You are probably acquainted with him. If you are satisfied of my sincerity and honor may I ask you to add your indorsement of the request I make of the general? You will never have occasion to regret it. I may be able in some way to oblige you.

Yours, truly,

A. J. McCALL.
