therefore, for you, to consist of the Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Brigades named on the plan submitted to you, leaving the other three brigades at Maryland Heights, Harper's Ferry, and Martinsburg, to constitute a division for Brigadier-General Roberts. The objection to this assignment for you is that it will reduce your command below what you ought to have. However, besides its political importance you will be expected to claim and add to it all or most of the regiments of General Moor's brigade, sending only to Brigadier-General Milroy the two Virginia regiments which formerly belonged to his division. With a view to this it is desirable that you should as soon as possible communicate with Brigadier-General Moor, and send to these headquarters a memorandum of the forces which may be properly claimed as belonging to the Eighth Army Corps, to be oranized into a fourth brigade for you. Ascertain and state also where those several regiments are now stationed and by whom severally commanded. With reference to this change you had better, perhaps, in anticipation of it as soon as convenient after Brigadier-General Roberts has arrived and is settled at Maryland Heights, return again and establish your headquarters at Cumberland, or at such point west of Martinsburg or Cumberland as seems best to you. Before you leave Harper's Ferry, however, you will proceed to make the changes heretofore indicated by the general commanding in the disposition of the troops at that point, putting Brigadier-General Kenly's brigade, consisting of four or five regiments of Maryland infantry, the Fourteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry, the Baltimore battery of light artillery, and Seventeenth Battery Indiana Light Artillery, on the Virginia side of the river, and the rest of the forces there, including the Neew York and Massachusetts heavy artillery, on Maryland Heights and Maryland side. The general commanding will postpone announcement of any new organization until the Senate adjourns, which must be in a few days. This is on account of Colonel B. F. Smith and Colonel Morris being nominated, as he understands, for brigadier-generals. If Colonel Morris is confirmed, he can command a brigade on Maryland Heights under Brigadier-General Roberts, and thus relieve from the objection of Colonel Staunton, Colonel Schley, or another Maryland colonel having that command.

I have the honor to be, your most obedient servant,

W. H. CHESEBROUGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HDQRS. MIDDLE DEPARTMENT, EIGHTH ARMY CORPS,Baltimore, March 8, 1863.

Brigadier-General MILROY,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: The general commanding having sent the Twelft Pennsylvania Cavalry, heretofore stationed at Martinsburg and Kearneysville, to report to you and become a part of your command, there is now no cavalry remaining upon that part of the railroad except the four companies of the Potomac Home Brigade. He advises, therefore, that the scouting of your cavalry should be frequently westward, so as to cover the approaches toward Martinsburg, Kearneysville, and that direction generally.

I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

W. H. CHESEBROUGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
