With these exceptions, the claims for losses do not
vary to a greaf^r extent than must occur where ves-
sels arc constructed at shops possessing different
facilities, and located at points where the cost of labor
and material is not the same. The contract for one
ot these vessels was signed on the 10th, for another
on trie loth, for another on the 18th, and for the resi-
due on the 9th September, 1802, and required them to
be launched in one hundred and twenty-six days. A
part wore ready to be launched at the time limited,
a part in March, one in June, and two in July, 1803,
and their completion was delayed by the fact that the
machinery was not ready until the latter part of 1863
and the first part of 1864.
The contracts for the machinery for the wooden
double-onders were at $32,000 each; the cost of con-
struction. as shown to the board, excluding the Wy-
alusmg and Mingoc, ranged from §102,513 73 to £146.-
777 89, and excluding the two vessels above mentioned,
the awardc ranged iiorn. M9.1G287 to 3-01,752 51.
The cost of the machinery for the Wyalusing and
Mingoe was below the averse, so thattho award for
both was but $11,634 "to; but it will be observed that
the contractors sustainedno loss by the rise in mate-
rial, they haying purchased the same at the time of
the contract. (See recoid of board, page 2b) The
cost of the Pcoiia machinery is much above the aver-
age, and is only accounted for by the fact stated by
the contractor, (record of board, page 26,) that he was
unfortunate in the first selection and purchase ot
iron, which proved to be defective, and which was
not discovered until ho came to work it, and thereby
he was delayed. This contractor soems to have been
relieved by an act of Congi ess from the requirement of
his contract for the completion of the work at a speci-

fieri, time; but the constantly advancing cost of labor
and material could not be. avoided. Jixceptins? the
WyahiMng, the Mingoe, and the Peoria, the eobt of
the machinery for the twenty-two vessels, and tho
losses thereon, do not vary to a greater extent than
must occur where work so difficult and expensive is
constructed at shops po&se&sing dili'eicnt facilities,
and located at points whore the cost of labor and
matoi ial is not the same.
The contracts for the machinery were made in Au-
gu^t, September, and October, 1802—reventeon being
in August, two in September, and three in October—
a;id required the machinery to be ready in seven
months, or within two months after the hulls should
be ready to receive the same: but it was not. plated
in the voxels in complete condition until the latter
part of 1803 and first of 1804, and in the ea.^o ot tho
Peoria not until May, 1805. The delay m tho ea^e of
the machinery lbr that vessel was in part caused by
the iron first used proving detective, requiring an
abandonment of part ot the work. (Sec page 20 of
record of board.)
The iron double-endersSuwance.Wateree. and Sha-
inokin were constructed at Chester, Pennsylvania,
under contracts made September'J, 1802, .1 utio 24,1803,
and July 27, 1803; and the W'ateiee was to be com-
pleted in one hundred and eighty da^, and the other
two in eleven months, from theeontracts.rt spectu cly.
The completion of tho Wateree was delayed until
December, 1803, by the ditlieully in getting material
and labor and by (he tn\ asion of Peuns\ Iv ama, and
the completion of the Snwanee was delayed until
December, IS'ol, and the Shamokin until July, 1805,
by the scarcity ol labor and material and the call lor
men at the time of t he rauU into Pennsylvania. (Seo
reeoid ol board, page* 11 and 20.) Thecontraet price
ol the Suwanee wns^203,l70; cost of herconstruction,
$2,37,031 00, and the awaid, 5*28,071 18. The contract
price of the Wateree, $275,000; the cost, ot Inn- con-
struction, $307,030 00; and the awatdmade,^31,101 03,
■which the committee think ou.'dit to luwe been ^32,-

$275,000; the cost, of her construction, #310,337 05; and
the award made, $33,002 0 .
The contract for the Muscoota was mado August 5,
1803, for the completion ui eleven months: but she
was not completed till December I, 1S01, because tho
eonti aetoi had so much other work to do lor the (!ov-
cmnieiit, and tho time was waned. The contract
