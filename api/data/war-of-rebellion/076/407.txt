BEFORE ATLANTA, GA., August 6, 1864-9 p.m.

(Received 12 m. 7th.)

Major THOMAS T. ECKERT:

Palmer was relieved this morning of the command of the Fourteenth Corps, which has been handled to-day by Brigadier-General Johnson, under direction of General Schofield. Some ground has been gained on right, but not enough to enable us to command railroad yet. An attack by Schofield's corps on enemy's earth-works was repulsed with loss of 1,000 men in all. Farther extension to railroad found rebel flank; too late for further operations,but there is brighten a little. Our line of battle thirteen miles long. Generals report operations and receive orders by telegraph.
