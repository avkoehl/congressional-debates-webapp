HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-7.35 [7.45?] a.m. (Received 8 a.m.)

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

General Griffin's troops will be massed near Mrs. Butler's; General Ayres near S. Dabney's; General Crawford about half way between. They are along a wood road running from near Mrs. Butler's to W. Dabney's, on the White Oak road. It is not practicable now for wheels and there is a very difficult branch of Gravelly Run that runs south from the White Oak Ridge, joining the main stream at the crossing of the plank road, which will take a long time to make practicable for wagons. I have all the pioneers I can spare at work on it. I will send you a sketch.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-8.25 a.m. (Received 8.40 a.m.)

Major General G. K. WARREN,

Fifth Corps:

There is firing along Humphreys' front. The major-general commanding desires you be ready to send your reserve, if it should be called for, to support Humphreys. There will be no movement of troops to-day.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-8.40 [a.m.] Sent 9.30 a.m.)

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch of 8.25 is just received. There is a good deal of musketry firing going on in our lines by the men firing off their guns to put in fresh loads. Unless I break loose entirely from General Humphreys, I think the force he sent to relieve General Griffin's is much more than under any circumstances could be needed there. My troops are, however, at all times as ready to move as it is possible to keep them for a long time. If the enemy break General Humphreys' line at any time, or threaten to do so, I shall not wait for orders to assist him if I can.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General of Volunteers.
