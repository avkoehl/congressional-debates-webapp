with marked bravery. Privates Thacker, Company G, and Henry Melton, Company F, Nineteenth Virginia, deserve notice.

I omitted to state that a good many of the brigade did not hear the order to halt when given, and kept on in pursuit of the fleeing foe. When about 600 yards from our advanced lines these, who were joined by many stragglers from other brigades, were charged by a squadron of United States cavalry, but our boys, though scattered in every direction, waited until they approached within 75 yards, when a volley caused them to break and flee in all directions, leaving many men and horses dead upon the field. They did not attempt a second charge.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers B. STRANGE,

Colonel, Commanding.

Major G. MOXLEY SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
