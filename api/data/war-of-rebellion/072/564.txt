of the Eighteenth Infantry on the 14th of June. These officers, soon after joining, consolidated their commands, making but one battalion out of the two in the Sixteenth, and one out of the two in the Eighteenth. On the 1st of September the number of officers and men present for duty with the brigade were, commissioned officers, 39; enlisted men, 1,318; aggregate, 1,357.

I transmit herewith the reports of the commanders of such battalions as remained with the brigade on the 1st of September, 1864.

I cannot close this report without calling attention to the fact that more than one-half of an entire campaign of 120 days was passed by this brigade under the fire of the enemy, and that in every position in which they were placed, both officers and men performed their duty so as to entitle them to the thanks and gratitude of the country.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

JOHN R. EDIE,

Major Fifteenth Infantry, Commanding.
