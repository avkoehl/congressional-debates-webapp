HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, August 2, 1864-11.15 a. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

I have returned from Ferrero's line. He has a good position, with the addition of another battery and a cavalry outpost which I have ordered to be furnished. The only weak point on my front seems to be the salient where the new work is building, on which the woods press too closely, and I have ordered out 100 axmen to slash that down at once.

COLONEL: I have the honor herewith to report that I was relieved this morning as general officer of the trenches by Lieutenant-Colonel Barnes. Nothing of importance occurred. I was captured during the truce and carried into the enemy's lines. After a long and tedious argument, I was released. I was in the lines of the enemy from about 9 a. m. until just before daylight this morning. The abatis in front of the extreme left of the Second Division is nearly destroyed and the breast-works weak.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
