whatever troops you can spare for the occasion to defeat it. I desire you also to assist me against any movement toward Augusta. The enemy has shown some signs of undertaking another raid. I sent this least the lines should be cut at any time.

General.

Brigadier General JOHN H. WINDER,

General Hood desires to know how the fortifications for the safety of the prisoners are progressing. Do you feel secure, and can the 500 militia there be spared?

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

Exaggerated statements of the losses of this army since I assumed command having been in reports of Federal commanders, I send the following statement: The effective strength of the army when I assumed command was, of all arms, 49,012; effective strength by last report, 43,091; decrease, 5,921. Re-enforcements proper since I assumed command have been sent back.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond, Va.:

Gholson's brigade, which ought to be 1,200 or 1,500 strong, has less than 300 men. I desire the remainder with the horses of the command ordered here.
