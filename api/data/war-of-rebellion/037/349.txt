the intense theat of the sun and frequent rains, and to impure water they are obliged to drink, my men are much reduced in strength, and in may instances entirely prostrated. It would be utterly impossible for most of them to make a forced march of any distance. Many of my trenches are extremely weak and unable to undergo the slightest fatigue Perhaps on an average 200 men from each of my regiments, animated by patriotic motives and a desire to be free, might be able to make a march of 10 or 15 miles and still be in condition to give battle to the enemy but hardly more than this number.

The spirits of my men are good, and I believe that almost to a man they would be willing to make vigorous efforts and to strike a blow for freedom; but I regret to say that-two THIRDS are unable to endure a march of 10 miles

I have the honor, to be very respectfully, your obedient servant,
