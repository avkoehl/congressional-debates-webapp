from Cheney's before I came out. Two regiments Federal cavalry have moved past my position on the road from Cheney's to Powder Springs. I gave notice of their move to General Armstrong, and have just received a courier informing me that he is moving to meet them. If he attacks vigorously on that road we shall compel the force at Cheney's to develop itself. Their skirmish line is slowly and cautiously advancing upon my position.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy is not extending his lines to the right (my left). The force of infantry in my front is checked, but sufficiently far in front of Cheney's house to enable a column to move down the Marietta road from there without any discovering it. I have sent scouts in to my right, with instructions to get within sight of the road from Cheney's to Marietta, and report if any such movement is in progress. I shall be able to let you know definitely in a very short time.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy are passing from Cheney's house on the Marietta road. You mistake when you suppose the force here to be cavalry; it is infantry. Three regiments of cavalry passed toward the bridge on the Powder Springs road, but did not halt here. I have sent three couriers and one staff officer to inform General Armstrong of the enemy's position and requesting him to attack them and I would charge the enemy in my front. He replied that the enemy were in Powder Springs and at the bridge, and did not think it prudent to move to my assistance here. I have ceased to expect him. The two regiments of Humes' division have been relieved as you directed and have gone. The enemy's cavalry do not and cannot run over my command.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: There is one brigade Yankee infantry at Cheney's house. My scouts have been on the road leading from Cheney's to Marietta and find that their line does not connect with the infantry on their left.
