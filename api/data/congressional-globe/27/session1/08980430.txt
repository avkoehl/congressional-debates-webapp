27th Cokg.-.Ist Sess.                                  Fiscal Bank—Mr. McKeon.                                                   II. of Reps.
give this bill his support In our section of the
country, the present administration party avoided
such an issue Where are the resolutions or in-
structions of Legislatures 1 In the State of New
York both branches of the Legislature were of the
present administration party, but they adopted no
resolutions on the subject Resolutions were in-
troduced into one branch, but they never reached
this Capitol The friends of the bank could not
obtain a majority in favor oi the measure So far
as the Executive has spoken, we may gather lrom
his message what his opinion is oí popular senti-
ment since the expiration oí the ehartei of the late
Bank of the United States.   The Executive says—
" The charter of the Bank of the United States
expired by its own limitations m 1836 An effort
was made to renew it, which received the sancuon
of the two Houses of Congress, but the then Pi esi-
dent of the United States exercised his veto power,
and the measure was defeated. A regard to truth
requires me to say that the President was fully sus-
tained in the couise lie had taken by the popular
voice. His successor in the chair of state unquali-
fiedly pronounced his opposition to any new charier
of a similar institution, and not only the popular
election which brought him into power, but the
elections through much oí his term, seemed cleaily
to indicate a concuirence wilh him in sentiment on
the part of the people"
Does the Executive say that there was any declara-
tion made by the people jn favor of a Bank of the
United States i By no means He tells you dis
tinctly, that although the people condemned, in his
opinion, the sub treasury, yet he had no means of
ascertaining what their wishes were in i elation to
the mode ol keeping the public moneys. Had he
any unequivocal evidence that they desired a bank,
as the friends of the measure insist evidences were
given, would not thesarae truth-lovjng voire which
pioclaimed that General Tackson and his immediate
successor weie sustained in then opposition loa
bank, have declared the unequivocal sentiments of
the American people to then representatives'*
These evidences were wanting lo satisjv the E\-
ceutive, and to the absence ot these ligh s may be
attributed the Executive s silence
In vam have the opponents of the measure ap
pealed to its friends tn await the action of the peo-
ple , to postpone the consideration oí the question
until it can be fairly presented, and the decision of
the people unequivocally expressed. What could
be more just1 We are lorccd to immediate ac-
tion An í\traoidmary session of Congress is.
called Amidst the shouts of a victorious party,
flushed with luumph <ind mad with their success,
legislation is demimled. On the swollen tide oí
popular excitement, this measure is tobe hunied
tbiough, and to be fastened on the country in the
hot haste with which it is brought ionv ml, it is
presented hete a ii uid on the constitution i fnnd
oa the friends oí a bank—mis slnpen, deformed ,
and while it is calculated to provoke the animosity
ol its opponents, it receives thesupportof itsinends
ruber from necessity than from any affection they
bear to this new born monstei
Let us examine some of the features of the bill.
Are they such as arc dcsiied by the friends oí such
in institution'2 You have established the mun
bank at Washington, m the Distnct of Columbia
Inquire ot a merchant, a linincief^-any mm hav
ing knowledge oí points oí finance—whete it should
be located , and he never would dieamol this city
The bank is to be the handmaid ol commerce—the
regulator of exchange—the great fountain head of
commercial matters , and its natural location must
be that point "where merchants most do eongregate '
What would bethought of a proposition for placing
the Bank of England at one of the extremities ol
that island1! What of a proposition tor planting
the Bank of Prance at Marseille  or any humble
port of that kingdom'1 It would be considered the
wildest foil} And yet it is proposed to place in
this city, whose crmmerce is very limited, an in-
stitution with millions oí capital, to direct the mon-
etary affairs of this TJnt m ' I ma} be told that the
facilities of travel aic vcr} great between this phte
and New York Do gentlemen lemember that
every minute of time in the management of such
an institution is most precious "> The Bank of En-
gland was saved from destruction by twentv imr
hours' no ice on one occ ision In the other end of
the Capitol, a distinguished Senator (Mr Calho' n)
proposed New Orleans as the point of location
That was voted down by the friends of the measure
The same fate would loilow a proposition to insert
New York And yet that is the point which one
of the ablest writers on this subject fixes upon He
insists that " the regulator of the national currency
and the equali7er of its exchanges should there sit,
where the currency is in tiulh measured and its
exchanges equalized, at the point where the two
extremes meet, of foteign and domestic exchange ,
that point of contact where they are to be made, by
coactmg, t© sympathise with each other " He then
adds " He who supposes that he thinks otherwise
deceives himself,—he does not think, but d?earn,
for he dreams that it is a matter of doubt whether
the steersman should stand at the wheel 01 the
windlass, he doubts whether he who holds the
reins had better sit on the box or in the basket, he
doubts whether the engineer of a ra'lroad tram
should ride on the locomotive or in one of the pas-
senger coaches, for all the^e are but exemplifica-
tions of the same absurdity—all equivalent to sup-
posing that the nauonal regulator of the curren, y
should be placed anywhere but where in fact the
currency is regulated—m the city of New York
It is a ease, m short, we again say, not of choice,
but of necessity "
Am I not justified m saying that this location is
a fraud on the friends of the measure l If located
here, the bank must stiuggle against the natural
current of b ismess, and be subject to difficulties
But why was it fixed here i The answer is ever
ready,—to quiet the conscientious scruples of con-
stitutional opponents of the measure It is intended
to evade the constitution Under the power to le
gtslate for the District of Columbia, is found a germ
of the most alaimmg species of consolidation
There are those who are anxious to establish a bank,
who have, after jeais of search and patient inquiry
to discover the powet m the constitution to locate
the institution, it length settled down on this Dis-
trict, and " within this magic circle" found that
fulcrum wh,ch Archimedes would have sought m
vam The friends of the pi escnt bill refer us to the
following provision oí the constitution, under which
they propose to act
"Toexetcise exclusive legislation in all cases
whatsoever, over such district (not exceeding ten
miles squaie) as may, by cession of particular
States, and the acceptance of Congress, become the
seat ot the Government of the United States , and
to exercise hie aulhoiity over all places purchased
by the consent of the Legislature of the Sta e in
which the same shall be, foi the election of forts,
magazines, arsenals, dock yaids,and othei needful
buildings "
What w ould the fiamers of the constitution think
of the ingenuity ol their descendants in discovering
m this section power to organize a Bank of the
United Stales, and intended for the evercise of its
functions over the whole tenitory of the Union1
Whit v ere the objects of the authors of the consti
union in iiaming tins prevision 1 We all know,
from the history of the countiy, that the object of
the fatlu rs of the constitution was to give to Con-
gress a place where it would be liee from interrup-
tion. This district of ten miles square was to be
the spot whereon Congtess was to legislate,—m
the first place, foi the general purposes necessary
to l's occupancy as a seat of Government, and,
secondly, fork cal purposes oí municipal legislation
The right to establish banks m the Distnct is an
incident to the municipal authority of Congress
The right to establish a bank for the purpose of
contiolling the cuiienc} and business of the Stales,
if it exis s at all exists as much without as withm
the Distnct To deny that Congress his this right
in foiin and v et claim it as an incident to the power
of municipal legislation m the Distnct,—to deny
that Congress has the light to establish a bank to
contro1 the business and currency of the Stitos,
and } ct claiT, under the Distnct power, a right lo
establish a bank not for the purposes of the District,
but to contiol the business and cunency of the
S'ates—ii not adishonest evasion, is a gross absurd-
ity By way of proving the ridiculous chaiacter
of the whole transaction, the District bank is de-
nied the privilege of discounting tor merchants
and tracers in the District lis action within the
District is crippled, while the moment it cresses
the District line, from which it claims Us existence,
its power expands At every step of this investi-
gation, the frail tenure by which the«e constitutional
doubters hold is apparent Why do they confine
themselves to the District of Columbia i They
have, under their reading of the constitution, other
places for locating their favorite but wandering
institution     Let them not restrict themselves to
the first part of the sentence Let them read the
latter part of the sentence of the constitutional pro-
vision from which they derive their authority, and
what will they find i Congress may not only ex-
clusively legislate for this District, but shall exei.
cvie like authority overall forts, magazines, arsenals,
dockyards, and other needful buildings Why not
locate the bank at Governor's Island, in the bay of
New York—at the navy yard, Brooklyn—or in
any of the numberless places covered by this clause
of the constitution 1 The very suggestion creates
a smile , and yet it is not more ridiculou  than the
provision under which this bank now is about to be
established The flimsy texture of the veil which
is thrown around this measure cannot conceal from
public gaze its misshapen featuies Again I de-
nounce it as a fraud on the constitution
Alter establishing the bank at Washington, the
iramers of this bill were at a loss in what manner
to obtain a foothold for it in the several States
The original proposition of the Treasury Depart-
ment suggested the propriety oí obtaining the assent
of the States before any branch should be introdu-
ced Thiswastbiovvn aside, and the power asserted
to locate blanches wheresoever they might be
deemed necessary in the opinion of the directors of
the bank We all know that an effect was made to
reinstate the freasury piojet, and that effortproved
fruitless Then came this section, of which I
know not m what terms to speak Its attempt to
harmonize conti idiotions,—its studied effort to
respect the constitution, by using its language, and
yet violating its spirit,—its disposition to pay due
homage to the rights and sovereignties of the States,
and yet its absolute command to them of submis-
sion ,—all stamp upon it the impress of fraud and
of hypocrisy towaids the States, while, at the same
time, it carnes w ithin it 'he most fruitful means of
corruption    1 vv ill read to you the section
"The directors of the said (corpotauon shall es-
t iblish one competent office of discount and depo-
sito in any State in which two thousand shares shall
hive been subscribed, or may be held, whenever,
upon application of the Legislature of such State,
Congress may bv law lequne the same And the
said directors may also establish one or more com-
petent offices of discount and deposite in any terri-
tory oi district of the United Stales, and in any
State, with the assent of such State, and, when es-
tablished, the said office or offices shall be only
withdrawn oi removed by fhe said directors, prior
to the expiration oi this ehartei, with the previous
assent of Congress Piobtded, in respect to any
State which shall not, at the first session of the Le-
gislature thereof held nfter the passage oi this act,
by resolution, oi other usual legislative proceeding,
unconditionally assent oi disssnt to the establish-
ment of such office ot offices within it, such assent
of the said State shall be thereafter presumed
Andpionded, im ettheless, That whenever it shall
become necessary and proper foi carrying into exe
culion any of the powers granted by the constit n-
tion, to establish an office or offices in any of the
States whatever, and the establishment thereof shall
be directed by law, it shall be the duty of the said
directors to establish such office or offices accor-
dingly "
Was there ever such an ingenious device i The
expressions of assent and dusent with which the
section is ornamented must sound strangely to
members educated m the school which respects
the rights of the States oí this Union If the assent
is giv tn, a branch mav be located m a State , but
if that State does not, vv ithin the next session after
the passage of this act, disseiit, % branch may also
be located That dissent must be shown in the
usual legislative manner—by the united action of
both legislative branches of the Government and
the Executive It is known to every member on
this floor, that in New York the Senate of the State
and the Executive claim to belong to the adminis-
tration party of the Union The probabilities are,
that at the next session of the Legislature there will be
a majority in the House ol Assembly opposed to
any Bank of the United States Suppose a resolu-
tion ol dissent be adopted in the House of Assembly,
and be rejected by the Senate your branch may
come into New York, while a majority of the peo-
ple of that State may be decidedly opposed to such
proceeding It seems to me this section is made for
the very case You are forcing on the State an in-
stitution to which you have good reason for believ-
ing she is utterly opposed What can such a course
lead to, but collision, discord, and a tendency to a
disruption of this Union i   This section proposes
