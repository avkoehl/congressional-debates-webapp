disapproving of the firing in the channel, and also announcing the fact that a regiment of infantry will be sent to report to me before the expiration of many days. With regard to the firing, I have to report that during two nights twenty shots were fired by my batteries since my last communication. During the remaining nights the moon was so bright that the enemy's movements could be fully perceived, and as they attempted nothing there was no further firing. Regarding the arrival of the regiment, I have to say that, in my opinion, it is much needed; not from the fact that I apprehend an attack from the enemy, but on account of the necessity by which I am compelled to maintain a long outpost line. My men are often on duty for several nights in succession without sleep. This hard duty accounts for the increase in my sick list.

I have the honor to be, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
