I could show you if I had time to do it, by
turning back to the laws of Congress, that since
ISKi wo have almost doubled tho pay of the
Army.
Now let me call your attention to the pay
of a lieutenant colonel in our Array and then
compare it with the pay of a lieutenant colonel
in England. A lieutenant colonel in onr Army
gets S3,G08 02 if he is hero in Washington
city, uud if he is out among trio Indians lie
gets about one thousand dollars less. That is
the difference in forage, rations, quarters, &c.,
as estimated here and estimated there. 'Now,
what is the pay of a lieutenant colonel in
England ? It any gentleman desires to know
where I get toy information, I will tell him thnt
I take it from Whitfaker's Almanac, -which is
recognized as an authority everywhere in the
world, so far as the expenses of government,
civil, militaiy, and naval are concerned.
in England a lieutenant colonel has first, to
pay for his commission. Commissions in the
English army, from lieutenant colonel down,
are mostly purchased from the Crown. Prom
that up they are appointed as they are here.
A lieutenant colonel pays to tho Crown for
his commission £7,250,"being about thirty-
five thousand dollars. His pay is §1,400 per
annum, and that is all the pay he gets. I
know that is not enough. It is not what I
would want to pay here, but I read it in order
to show the difference between the pay of the
Army here and the pay of the army in other
countries. The men in England who purchase
their commissions are wealthy men who draw
but small pay. But an officer of the army in
England, when he is considered an officer of
orders, gets pay for his orders, and that, in
creases his pay. Regiments in England are
almost all nominally commanded by gert rals
they are the colonels of the regiments; bui the,
lieutenant colonels are the actnai command-
ers of the regiments. I do not want our sys-
tem to be the same as that, of England. I
want no such thing. I want- our officers to be
commissioned for what they have dune in tho
service or according to their capacity ar.d
ability, and not by purchase. But I do desire
that tho pay of our Army shall be put upon a
proper footing, so that one colonel shall get
the same pay as another colonel and one cap-
tain tho same pay as another captain.
Sow, in oar bill we propose to pay the Gen-
eral of the Army $12,000. Some members who
