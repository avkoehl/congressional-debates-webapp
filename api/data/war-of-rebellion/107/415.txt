Division and brigade commanders will require those regiments which have not reduced the number of their tents to four common and one wall tent for each company, and one wall-tent to other officers, at once to pack the surplus, mark them, and turn them in to Captain Woods, acting assistant quartermaster, at the depot. The spare wagons which will thus be created must be used to carry provisions. Every wagon which can be spared from treansporting the regiments will at once be sent to Colonel Crosman, who is authorized to call for what he requires. The commanding general calls upon every one to reduce the amount of their transportation to enable him to move a large force to the front and to keep this army provisioned.
