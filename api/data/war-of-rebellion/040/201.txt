Illinois, which has not yet returned from picket, and which is not fully supplied with forage. Upon examination, 50 horses of the Eighth Illinois and 100 of the Eighth New York are found to be in such poor condition that they would undoubtedly give out in two or three days' march. I have directed them to be sent to the deport, subject to the approval of the division commander.

The regiments report as follows, inclusive of packers and pioneers,

viz:

Eighth New York Cavalry.....................560

Eighth Illinois Cavalry.....................450

Third Indiana Cavalry.......................340

Third Virginia Cavalry........................60

Ninth New York Cavalry.......................90

Making the total strength.................1,500

The third Virginia have five wagons, but no pack mules nor saddles. They have been ordered to retain one wagon, to carry forage and rations.

I presume the pack-saddles could now be obtained, for which I respectfully request the approval of the general commanding.

I am, very respectfully,

B. F. DAVIS,

Colonel Eighth New York Cavalry, Commanding Brigade.
