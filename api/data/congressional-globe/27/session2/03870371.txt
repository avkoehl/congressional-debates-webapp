concentrated to a point, and about to be dissipated These ques
turns, it was true, were m the hands of the Executive, yet it
might not be long before they would be placed m the hands oí
Congress Let us, then, wait and see the issue of these ques
tions, ana seeifsomething cannot be done foi the ielief of the
country, before we entertain the question of adjournment. I he
resolutions passed at previous qpssions of Congress never tended
to any advantageous íesuit The transacting of the important
business was not expedited thereby Congress had pot yet done
any of its important business, and he wasasnamed to say that that
business was yet to be commenced He was pained to sayo,
yet it was true He trusted, theiefore, that the Senate would
not entertain the idea of fixing a pernd of Adjournment until
they had accompl shed the greatest good for the country that
could be accomplished under the cucumstances.
Mr CLAY vaidthe houi for taking up the special order had
arrived He honed the Senatoi fiom Alabama wou'd permit
the resolution to lie ovei if it was taken up, no doubt the mo
tion to lay it on the table would prevail
Mr KiNGsaid hehai no disposition io interfere with the
special order The resolution might be per touted to be nvei
if taken up, but hemfoimed the Senatoi from Sou h Carolina
[Mr Preston} that he would not abandon the piopo^mon
The probabdny was that not much of the irnpoitant business of
the session would be transacted until the day of adjournment
was fWed In reply to the Senator, he said that the circum
stance of Congress íemaining in sesaion would not have any
effect on the pending negotiations
The subject was here dropped.

Mr. CLAA'sresolutions were taken upas th^unfini^hed/bu i
ness of yesterday, the question pending being Qfi the adoption
of Mr Rives's amendments                                *            ¿
Mr BA.TD3 oba?ived that there was a sins e jpont iffit men
tioned yesterday, to which he wi hed to call the attention of ihe
Senate 11 seemed to be taken for granted by all thsf benatois
who had^pekenon the subject of the tariff, with ihjf excei tion
of the Senatoi from Connecticut [Mi Hu^TiNGim ] that the
compromise act was an authouty not to be questioned The
application of the land fund to puipo^es of revenue, le con
tended, was niconM&teiu w th the compromise act But that
was not the pomt he whdW to pall the attention oí the teemte
to it was the fact, which seemed to be ovpllooked, that the
comprom se wa^made by two pa ties havm? tquai tights m 1
if one yielded pait to letam pait so did the oilier 71 e uní!
paity hadretained rights equivalent to thobp suirendered. but

wholly abrogate tne lescrved rights of the ti-ifT pany, win
had become undei d fieient c1 re u instances, a pai y to ft c com

gle aspect of the case
Mr CLAY considered it very urftniunate that Jie guest on

He dwelt at some length on the spectacle of unstable legisla-
tion which would be presented to the country by the pioposi
tions now pressed upon Congress, and depicted m strong tetms
the Executive and his advisers
Mr RIVES would have been happy if he could have been
spared the necessity of saying any thing to protract the discus*
sion He was, however obliged to declare that much of what
the Senator had said, was said without the slightest foundation
It was he, and not himself, (Mr R ; who had come forward to
unsettle legislation He appealed to every membei of Congress
to say if the distribution act ever could have been passed
but for the insertion of the clause restoring the land fund under
the contingencies now existing Is it not the Senator himself,
by his proposition m these resolutions to revoke (fiat clause,
who comes forward to unsettle legislation? He desired to speak
with all due respect for the Senatoi from Kentucky He en-
terU ned for him the highest respect, politically and persona'iy,
and this respect he believed he had manifested in all his it^a
tions towaids that honorable Senatoi, but at the same t-me be
must be permitted to say, that upon this floor he had ever foi
lowed that course which his own breast prompted him to pur-
sue, as regarded thehonoi and the interests of the country The
Senator had thought propei to make an appeal to all those sensi
bilmes which are &oreadily acted upon,by alluding emphatically
to the instability of legislation, and at the very moment of al'
luding to this circumstance, m reference to the proceedings of
odiéis, the Senator himself was seeking, by the proposition
which he had submitted to the Senate not only to break up the
distribution act, although he himself had been heretofoie so
very as«iduousm producing its adoption, but also to break up
the operation of the comprsmise act, anothei measure about
whi Ji the Senatoi had exhibited extreme solicitude, one of the
Senatoi ?s own measures indeed, and he might, perhaps, be per-
mitted to say, it waa one one of the brightest laurels which
adorned his brow
Were not both the distribution and the compromise aets,
Whig measures'*   Undoubtedly they were, and he (Mr Rivps)
demonstrated his loyalty to the Wing cau^e by seeking to
maintain them inviolate    But the Senator himself was now
coming forward and endeavoring to bieak them up    And he
inufat be permitted to say, that if the Whig beau of the country
was io be pierced by the pioposittcn wh ch he had submitted,
or   if   the   Demociatic   heart   wat,   to   Le   wounded,   he
would  regiet   it    extiem^ly      But    while    he    was    de
sirous of avoiding   offence,    he   had   at  thp   *ame   time   a
higher motive of action, namely aieganKor the country s ho
nor, it was this only which commanded his allegiance    He
was sorry to give offence to those with wh, rn he had the honor
to co opeiate, but he never intended to make himself the mere
slave of any party, or of any party leader    1 he gieaf mteiesta
oí the country were the guides of his conduct    lins was the
sr mt in which he had ever acted    At the same time he would
deeply regret if hia course should give offence to any, for he de
sired to be at peace with all mankind, but no considerations of
tliib knd3bould foiamomeotmterfeie with whathe considered
to  be due  to the gieat interests  of   the  country    And if
theie  was  ever   a   time   when   oil   t moi    coi sideiations
<-nouid be abandoned, it wis at thefpuscnt cnsn of the alfana
of this country    The Senator haddeclaied that the propnsi
tion suggested by his amendments in regard to the d sposiuon
of the public lands was wnhont any son of utility^ that those
lands were not likely to yield more than a million of dollars
And (his, asseition he had  made in the very face of the fact
which aopeared fiom documents sub mtted to Cong) pes during
tre e\lrase--sion,  that  dunng the whtle p nolwltioh had
e'apsed since the adoption of the piesent s>«um of land sales,

Withieierence to the clause m tliecorrpromise act on which
the Senatoi from Kentucky so mucn relifd to show that revenue
alone fiom customs was looked to for the support of th> tío-
vernment, he argued that the true construction was, thatw,hen,
the resources of the Governr&elit should-fail short, art, with
twenty per cent, of duties, could jiot meetthe wants-ofan ectXBo-
mical admmistrauon, then the tariff might be raised.6 Tlie
twenty per cent should be first" proved ínsTiflicent witi> other
sources^ before the limit of the compromi&e act couíd be ex-
ceeded These other sources of revenue were dividend and
instalments from banks, debts due, and theland íun^. &
As far as he understeod the compromise act, he was ^iliiBff
to carry it out -in good -faith and m a liberal spirit T$i& con-
struction which the South put upon the compromise act waa
recognised ever since its passage up to the extra eess on-*
sanctioned by Oongiess and acquiesced m by all parties, and
never till the extra session was the question raised of the iisa
of the land fund by the Government, being a violation of the
principle of the compromise act He next advened to the
question at issue yesterday as to the suspension of the opera-
tion of ihe distribution law in relation to the land granted to the.
new States He could not agree to mix up the question of tha
grant of lands with his amendments, whuh rolated alone to
revenue
The Senator from Kentucky had asked under what particular
circumstances the propositions he (Mr Hives) had offered were
bi-oughtfnrward He would say that any movemetitpf his was
wholly unconnected with any movement at the other end of the
avenue His amendments hadbeenoFtred nefuie the message
of the Pres'dent had been piesejited He had no concert what-
evei With the Executive on the subject Infegaidto the par-
tyaspectof this question, he was not seeking to undo anything
the Whig party had accomplished at the extra session; he was
only seeking to carry out one of the Whig laws of tho extra
session
Mi CLAY did not know why the Senator fiom Virginia
had exhibited such sensibility on his (Mr C'r) allusion to ihet
rema'-kab'e coincidence between his movement and that m the
other House ancLat theotherend of the avenue He did noj:
know why the feenatoi found it necessary to decíate he would
not he governed by any party or any leadei Did he mean that
he (Mr Clay) ever assumed to be %i$ leader, or the leader of
any body elset

that lie estimated the fund fiom public Undsth n at thiee mil-
lions He denied that estimates made nine ycai s ago were ap-
plicable to the piesent time The question was could the

He then adverted to the charges mide a amst him of a pro-
position to bieakm upon two compiomi e*— ore tie compio-
