HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,June 1, 1864-12.30 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

General Meade has directed me to hold my present line.* Should I move back I will telegraph you about Owen remaining with his left fixed.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 1, 1864-1 a. m.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I am satisfied that the movement of troops on the Mechanicsville road was only the massing of a division for the attack on Willcox's left flank, in case we had made a general attack.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 1, 1864. (Received 7 a. m.)

Major-General BURNSIDE:

In order to open road to our left and to develop the enemy's position, I have had to extend my line from your left, to move upward of 4 miles. It is only a single line, assisted by entrenchments and swamps, but nearly without reserves. I shall be unable to give you any re-enforcements if you are pressed, unless I abandon my line. General Meade directs me to call on you for aid in the event of my being pressed.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,June 1, 1864-7.20 a. m.

General WILLIAMS:

Your dispatch received.+ We have been feeling the enemy this morning, and find no noticeable change. We are trying to drive his sharpshooters out of a house with our artillery, after which we will try to advance our skirmishers and support them strongly. Our new line is entrenched and is quite strong, and I think we can hold it against a force much superior to our own. General Potter reports noise in enemy's line last night as if artillery and wagons were moving to the rear and left.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
