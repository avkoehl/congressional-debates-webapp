CHATTANOOGA, TENN., October 15, 1864 - 4. 30 p. m.

(Received 16th.)

Major-General BURBRIDGE,

Lexington:

Your dispatches relative to troops are received. I presume those you sent to Thomas will be returned as soon as the present emergency is passed. I will telegraph him about it. You were left to consult your own judgment as to what troops you could spare from Kentucky, and should not weaken your command too much.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
