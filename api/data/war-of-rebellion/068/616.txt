Dam. Since I got into their rear there has been great excitement among the inhabitants and with the army. The citizens report that Lee is beaten. Their cavalry has attempted to annoy my rear and flank, but have been run off. I expect to fight their cavalry south of South Anna River. I have no forage. Started with half rations for one day, and have found none yet. Have recaptured 500 of our men, 2 colonels.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
