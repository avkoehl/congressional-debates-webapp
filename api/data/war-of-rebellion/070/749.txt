NEW MARKET, May 27, 1864-2 p. m.

(Received 2.10 p. m.)

General R. E. LEE,

(Care of General Cooper):

General Hunter commands the forces advancing upon me. He occupied Mount Jackson at noon to day. His cavalry outnumbers ours two to one; his infantry four to one; his artillery four to one. He is moving on my flank, and will compel me to fall back. There is no point this side of Mount Crawford where I can successfully resist him, and there it is very doubtful, though I will do my best.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

JACKSON RIVER, May 27, 1864.

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW:

My command now moving to Callaghan's, except guards here. I have no additional news from Beverly; none to indicate the massing of troops there.

W. L. JACKSON,

Colonel.

LACEY SPRING, May 29, 1864.

Major C. S. STRINGFELLOW:

The order received from General Lee was: "Keep commanding officer in Southwestern Virginia informed of enemy's movements in this district, and co-operate in driving him back." Enemy is again advancing to-day; as soon as his purpose is fully developed, I will notify General Jones.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

LACEY SPRING, May 29, 1864-4 p. m.

General W. E. JONES:

Enemy, 7,000 strong, advancing from Mount Jackson; also reported by signal corps in force at McDowell to-day. Is it possible for you to aid me? Staunton is his objective point.

J. D. IMBODEN,

Brigadier-General.

CALLAGHAN'S, May 29, 1864.

General W. E. JONES:

General Imboden telegraphs Lacey Spring that he is pressed by the enemy. All quiet in my front and right.
