Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Gulf:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of Your letter of instructions of the 7th instant in relation to the records and papers of the State government lately located here. One of the first things attended to upon my arrival was to serve a notice upon each of the State officers requiring them to transfer without delay and in good condition to Captain C. E. Stevens, of my staff, all public records pertaining to the State. This was done, and I believe that everything of value was delivered. This property was boxed up and forwarded by steam-boats to department headquarters by special messenger. I did not cause duplicate invoices to be made, but complete invoices accompanied the property, and duplicates can easily be made. Among the property a large amount of securities belonging to the New Orleans banks was surrendered by the treasurer, and were sent to New Orleans in charge of Mr. Graham, of the First National Bank.

I have the honor to be, Your very obedient servant,

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General.
