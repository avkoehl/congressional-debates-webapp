tice in such oases to provide by law for having
the pension relate back to the time of the
application?
Mr. MOORE. With the consent of the
House. I will state my reasons for asking that
this should go to a committee of conference.
Our Committee on Invalid Pensions has uni-
formly discriminated as to the meritorious char-
acter of claims for pensions, and in several in-
stances have gone back in order to give pen-
sion from the date when the right to pension
accrued, but in every instance the Senate has
sent back the House bill with an amendment
like the one now before the House, making
the pension begin from the date of the passage
of the act. We have gone on pursuing that
course, feeling it was a just and proper one,
and we have concurred in the amendments of
the Senate up to this time. It now becomes
exceedingly important that the House com-
mittee should have a conference with the Sen-
ate, and if they propose to establish this as a
universal rule to apply to all cases, and if they
will never go back.in any case, however merito
rious, it is time the House should know it
and the House committee should understand
it, so that, if necessary we shouki conform our
course to the course of the Senate. Half a
loaf is better than none. It becomes ridicu-
lous in us to be passing pension claims giving
arrears of pensions when the Senate contin-
ually rejects all such pensions and send the
bills back to us here with amendments and we
concur in them. We now propose to have a
conference between the two Houses to settle
the matter.
The amendment was non-concurred in, and
a committee of conference was asked on the
disagreeing votes between the two Houses.
