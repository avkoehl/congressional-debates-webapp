the functions assigned him by the Constitution Where, m
that instrument, did monopolist manufacturers find their power
of dictating to Congress what sort of revenue bill the countiy
should have! Where did they, or theinnstrumenls in Congress,
find the pewer to tax the whole comm unity foi their especial
benefit Or where, m the Constitution, did they find the doc-
trine of protection at all? It was high time to check and dis
countenance this intermeddling and dictation
He was favorable to the iron manufacturers, but hewifehedto
see them depending on then own efforts and then own mdu&tiy,
and not upon the bounty of any Government If their interests
•are to be built up by thefoiceof legislation, common sense
and experience demonstrate that they must continue to be
fosteied—that the aid and bounty to them must be progressive
ly increased, till their craving appetites become insatiable, and
to an extent that, in the end, could not be appeased by any
Government on earth Let them alone— leave them to them
selves—and they will flourish and grow up more healthily,
and will stand their ground without any props or adventitious
aid
Mr S contrasted the solicitude of hiacolleague |Mi Hunt
ington] for the iron manufacturing interest, with hi1? apathy
and disregard of the wool growing mtere&t of his Stale
Mr CHOATE observed that it was not hia intention to oc
cupy more than ten ry mutes of the time of the Senate He
would briefly state the reasons which had brought him to the
conclusion of voting for this blil He felt rejoiced that, asa
Whig and a politician, he could support this measure as a pure-
ly Whig measure He could not hail it with the sameexulfa
lion as if it were in Us original shape, but such as it was, he
took it as the best that could now be effected It would do much,
©ven now, at the eleventh hour, m its effects on the industry
of the country, and as a measure of relief to the Government,
to reanimate and reassure the Whig party
He could not, however, exult with the Senator from Pennsyl
vania, for that which was a source of exultation with that Sen-
ator, was to him and his friends a great sacrifice The Senator
fiom Pennsylvania was consoled m voting foi this bill, because
it defeated the great Whig measure of distribution But he
<Mr C ) derived consolation—not, indeed, from the same source,
for  o one could deplore more than he did the necessity of sac
nficing distribution—but from the fact that, inefead of the Whig
party being defeatedm two measures—purely Whig mea&mes -it
would succeed in carrying one, a' least, and that one would
have the eflect of cheering many adioopmg heait, and gladden
ing many a fheside, where misejy and destitution now rievail
Rejoiced would he have been if both measures could have been
achieved, but as it was no longei doubtful that to insist upon
both was to defeat both, he was satisfied that true policy ic
quired the postponement of the one, lor the sake of¡=ecurmg the
blessings of the other As it was come to a choice between
them, it could be considered no detriment to the measure of
distribution to say that its immediate consummation was less
urgent than the measure now before the Senate This is ur
gent and indispensable, it is an indispensable duty, the Govern
ment cannot exist without it, the languishing and prestíate in
dustry of the countiy must perish if it i& not passed It may
not beeveiything the country wiüheb for and wants, but it i 
something, and that something is important, and will effect much
good It is, besides, all that can, at this momentous crisis, be
obtained, and thet>e were reasons sufficient to influence him,
and satisfy him that it was his duty to support it All mu&tsee
the importance of the cnsis A whole sebsion of unexampled
length had passed away, withoutanythmg efficient having been
done to accomplish the great and leading business of the ses
sion—the adjustment of the tariff
This was the great work which the country expected at the
hands of the Whig party It had not been neglected, though
delayed till a late period ot the session, but even then, what
had been done had been rendeied nugatory by a power tl ey
could not control The desire to cany two concunent meab-
ures was said to be the cause of this failuie A diffuent aspect
of things was then pie&ented Things should oe viewed as
they really stood The Government was in a atóte of destitu
tion, there was no íevenue, for the Whig party, which had the
majority in Congress, believed theie was no existing law for the
collection of revenue, public ciedit was depressed and unavad
able, the industrial classes were m danger of being reduced to
utter destitution, and one great and beneficent measure could
reanimate and reinvigorate all Who, then, could doubt that it
was a duty to sacrifice much for the attainment of that gieat
measure of lehefi It was a measure due to the Government
and to the countr> alike
Mr C pointed to the immense amount of capital whuh had
been expended on the faith ol the protection of the General
Government, to the numerous classes oflaboierb dependent upon
that piotection foi subsistence an 1 the very bieath of life, to the
fatal effects—the destitution, beggary, and rum—which awaited
tho°e numerous classes if this countiy should be overstocked and
oveirun with the productions oí foreign manufacturer  duung
an inteimission of pro ection from revenue And he asked,
could it be doubted that hundreds upon hundreds of thoubands
of hearts palpitated with bieathle^ anxiety, awaiting the action
of the Whig party on this very b-11 ^ He-was a*aie tint the
Whig party might tiuly say they had already done all they
could do, but had been thwarted by the Executive Congress
had labored for months to perfect some measure of relief Anx
ious to preserve good faith towaida those fetatcs which had a
deeper interest m distribution than the manufacturing States,
the two measuies of revenue and distribution were ticated as
inseparable But did not his fnend fiotn Maryland see that
Executive vetoes had utterly severed the connexion for the
present? Did he not know that, until «ome change m the Con
satution, this power of the Executive was uncontrollable, and
that, therefore, there was no alternative between bepaiation
and the total abandonmpnt of both measured
The Executive leaves it not in the power ofConsre^ to con-
summate both, though alike good, but does not e\cludeacucu
on one that m itself is an im pen'ant, essential ami utal «nol
Presidential vetoes put Congress in such a condition that it can
not do better than it now attempts to do If, theieiore that
other great and impoitantgood, to which the Senator fiom
Maryland clings so tenaciously, cannot he effected, doe* ii t
the responsibility pass fiom Congress to the Executive bu
does not the responsibility remain, of providing leveimeanl
protection foi be does not, m preventing disti ibuiion ben ? mad**
effective, preven* action on the measure of revenue and proteo
«on. Could any one say that, m passing this bill without die
tribution, considerable advance wa* not made m redeeming
Whig responsibilities? He did not think there was ground for
tiie unfavorable comparison drawn by his friend from Maiy
land, between this bill and the lull formerly before the Senate
Would he not admit that circumstances had entirely changed?
Whatcannot be effected in conjunction, may be accomplished
m detail The great and numerous interests dependent for ex
istence on protection, may befirstsaved, and they will then be
placed in a condition to aid in the achievement of that good
w Inch other interests of the country languish foi
He had hitherto been influenced, as his friends had been, by
apprehensions that to yield up distribution would be to en
courage executive encroachments ol power But a more dis
passionate consideration of the subject had satisfied his mind
that the íesistance already made would have the salutary effect
of repressing such a tendency, and that, unless some great
principle of public liberty were involved ma further demonstra
tion of resistance to executive power a time had come when
his fuendswere bound todo all the good they could, even if un
dei the necessity of nanowing then purpose to that object
alone Letthismeasuie be adopted, and let men of business
see what they have to depend on New life and energy will be
given to the whole country, as well as to themachineiy olGov
ernment Public ciedi will be restored, and it is not unlikely
that, in a short time, such a surplus may accumulate in the
treasury as will insuie distribution The country will arou=e
itself, like a giant refieshed with bleep ihe national deb!,
about, which so much noise was now made, w ould speedily be
paid off For surely fifteen or twenty millions of debt would
then be found most inconsiderable, and it would be seen that
this outcry about it was no more deserving of notice than the
singing of a grasshopper in the graso This great nation can
shake off that paltry debt, as the lion shakes the dew droo from
his mane On theothei hand, decline to pass it, and adjourn—
what, he would ask, would the chance? foi future di&tubution
be worth* How many, besides the fuends of distribution,
would look to that adjournment with dismay? Cast before such
a famishing multitude the whole benefit of distribution, and it
would be but as a drop of dew among ten thousand men dying
of thirst
Would not the countiy ask, why the one measure which
cou'd be effected had not been passed—and why miberv shou id
be multiplied because, all could not be relieved? Such wnnl I
be the cool judgment of the country such would be gentle
men'bowu judgment of themselves, in their calmer moments
of lefiection They would not have returned to then homes,
and laid their heads upon then pillows foi half an hour, with
out being aiou^ed to the consciousness that they could have ef
fected a great measure ol rebel foi the countiy, but bad impiu
dentiy, in the moment of excitement and pas«ion, neglected to
do i* But paf-i this measure, and each, when he rises from
Ins nillow will led consoled fot the lossof that which lie could
not help, by the attainment ui that which had brought ¡oy and
gladness to many a constituent's fireside It should be íecol
lected that Congiess was not in a condition in which it could
command success, nei her was it in a condition in which it
could afford to put off to another and more distant day the i&
sue now penning In a contest of a pnvate rutu e, personal
Itehngb might justify what prudence nii^,ht foiego, but gen
tlemen did not =¡tand hue to gratify their private feelu gs—
they had a gieat tiust for other  to fuihi, and the dictates of pi u
dence were imperative
This was no yielding up of Whig principles     On the con
trary,itwdb the consummation of a gieat and leading Whig
measure    Neuhei  was the postponement of dibtubution an
abandonment of thit punciple    It was a postponement, nut a

Mr C dwelt a1 some length on the confusion of ideas which
had been occasioned by the supposed right of making pi otee
tion and distubuiion dependent on each o her He thought tint
more ptactical gool could be eflecteu by sepaia ing them, now
that executive vetoes had vntually cut them asundei He

out saying more about the Executive vetoes, or endeavoring1,
by anything he should say further, to head the President, he
asked—was it not competent for the Whig party, instead of giv-
mg up one great measure for the sake of carrying the other, to
support both, and share them equally with the creat interests—
looking to the one with as much solicitude as to the other? Why
should he be asked to give up and surrender one great measure,
m order to relieve the distresses of the manufacturers, without
any sympathy for the agricultural interests of the country1?
Should not each have a fair proportion of the good? Let those
w ho prize this bill so highly share the sweet, as well as the hit
ter draught with him Let them agree to abate some of their
appetite for protection, let them accept reasonable protection,
and leave to his constituents some oí the advantages of distn
bution Let the Senator fiom Massachusetts come forwaid
and compiomise with him What is this bill! It is a bill to
ta\ the interests of the agriculturists for the benefit of the man
ufaetuiers Thm the agriculturists were willing to beai, if
they had but their shaie of the benefits, but do not cast on them
the necessity of swallowing the whole bitter draught, and re
fuse to share with them the sweets
The CHAIR then put the question, Shall the amendments be
oideied to be engrossed, and the bill read a third time?—when
the v eas and nays werecalled for, and ordered
Mr. WRIGHT said he rose, not 10 make a
speech, bin «o (Velare that he was about to record
his vote in favor of this bill—a declaration which,
it pamed him to know, would carry disappoint-
ment and s-onow to the minds of many of his mo*t
respected and esteemed fnendc, both m and out oí
this hath It had been Ins habit, as it had been his
pleasure and pride, to act wiih bis politic al friends;
and he could not describe tbe reluctance under
which he now found himself compeÜeu io separate
from them. Yet, after the most mature and anx-
ious reflecuo , he had come to the conclusion that
it wa^> his duty to vote for this measure, because
he assumed that this bill must pa^s m tbe form it
now bears, or that no revenue law can pass at the
present <£^sion. It he was correct m this assump-
tion, then he c< uld not avoid the conclusion he had
announced, and he did not suppov  theie was a
single member of either Houm? of Congress who
supposed for a mom nt that, if this bill be reject-
ed upon this vole, any further attempt is to be
made, at this sesión, to p?s> a reverue bill. The
alternative presented, then, is this bill or none; and
the deep and deliberate conviction of his mind was
that this bill chould pass, bad and loaded with de-
fecN as he believed it to be, rather than that none
should pa^s.
A collateral consideration had greaily troubled
him in assenurg to this conclusion. His first ser-
vice in CoLgre^-s  as as a member of the Commit-
tee on Manufactures oí the Hou^-e of Representa-
tive*-, during the sesbion of 1827 and 1828, when
he agisted to form, and voted tor, the tariÜ bill of
1828, which ^as been so extensively denominated
"the bid of abommauors " He w?s then wholly
without experience m legislation of this class and
character, but his exprrtei ce irom that action had
taught him the truih of the adage, that "men's evil
deedú follow them " He became very soon con-
vinced that he had committed a great error upon that
occasion ar-d it was powble he was about to com 
mil another as ^reat now It grieved him to know
anü feel that many friends were wuhin the reach of
