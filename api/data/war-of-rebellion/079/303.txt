I certify that the above report is correct.

HENRY W. WELLS,

Major and Chief of Artillery and Ordnance.

LEXINGTON, October 15, 1864.

Brigadier General HUGH EWING,

Louisville, Ky.:

The Thirteenth Kentucky will be sent entire. the Forty-eighth Kentucky can be so disposed as to cover Hopkinsville and Russellville, but must operate actively against the rebels.

By order of Brevet Major-General Burbridge:

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.

LEXINGTON, KY., October 15, 1864.

Brigadier-General MEREDITH,

Paducah, Ky.:

Your dispatch received. I have again urged upon the department commander the necessity of obtaining more troops for your district. Will get you re-enforcements if possible.

S. G. BURBRIDGE,

Brevet Major-General.

CHICAGO, ILL., October 15, 1864.

Major-General BURBRIDGE,

Lexington:

I have no men to spare, but if they should be wanted for the service you indicate I'll make them. My information of Forrest's movements is in conflict with that of General Meredith. Only two days ago I was informed he had been driven out of Tennessee by General Thomas forces.

JOS. HOOKER,

Major-General.
