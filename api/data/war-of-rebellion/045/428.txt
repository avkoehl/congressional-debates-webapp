NEAR HOOD'S MILLS, MD., June 30, 1863-5 a. m.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR:

COLONEL: As far as I can learn, the enemy has all passed Westminster. Unless Hooker's cavalry can intercept them west of there, and drive them back, I believe there is little chance of their returning this way. I sent last night to communicate with Hooker's picket on the Frederick and Baltimore turnpike, a few miles west of Cooksville, but the officer has not returned. Rations are out to-day, but I can manage if you have any information that they are likely to return this way. Have sent north to Freedom, and shall wait here for orders from you.

C. R. LOWELL, JR.,

Colonel.

(Received 11. 05 a. m.)

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I could not telegraph yesterday. The immense amount of stores here cannot be removed under at least ten days. I shall be obliged to leave General Elliott's brigade-3, 300 men-with artillery and engineer company. I commenced this morning to destroy ammunition. Some of the heavy guns will have to be left. I am in readiness to move with the remainder of my force, but will await your instructions. I cannot communicate with headquarters Army of the Potomac.

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

No ammunition or stores should be destroyed, excepting in case of absolute necessity. These things should not be abandoned, but defended. You can now communicate with General Meade.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
