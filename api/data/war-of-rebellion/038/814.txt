Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond:

At least 1,000,000 rounds of small-arm ammunition, principally caliber . 69, should be sent here immediately from nearest depot, and as much as possible.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond:

I think enemy has landed nearly his whole force on this side. I am concentrating all I can. General Bowen telegraphed 5. 30 p. m. last night that he should fall back under cover of night to this side of Bayou Pierre, and endeavor to hold position until arrival of re-enforcements. If he holds that position, I have directed him, if his communications with Vicksburg are open, to endeavor to continue it, but if he has fallen back to Grand Gulf, which is reported, and which is a cul-de-sac, he must endeavor to cross Big Black, destroying his guns and stores. The battle will probably be fought outside of Vicksburg. Bowen says Grant, McClernand, Stevenson, McPherson, Smith, and Osterhaus are there.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

Vicksburg, May 2, 1863.

President JEFFERSON DAVIS, Richmond:

You know the country about Port Gibson and approaches to Vicksburg and Jackson. General Bowen, after maintaining his position below Bayou Pierre until night against overwhelming odds, informed me at 5. 30 p. m. that he was compelled to fall back to this side Bayou Pierre until night against overwhelming odds, informed me at 5. 30 p. m. that he was compelled to fall back to this side Bayou Pierre.
