MORRISTOWN, March 1, 1864.

Brigadier General E. E. POTTER,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The general commanding directs me to acknowledge receipt of 12.30 and 4.30 p. M. of yesterday, and to sayin reply that the danger of our lacking subsistence stores is greater than that we shall need ammunition. He therefore wishes the train of sixty wagons loaded with subsistence stores forage. The continued heavy rain will make transportation quickly precarious and the supply of food for a number of days in advance become a primary consideration. The general wishes the attention of those in charge of the matter particularly called to the necessity of flooring culverts, cattle guards, and bridges in case supplies are attempted to be sent by rail cars drawn by mules. Reports indicate that the bulk of Longstree'ts force is between Bull's Gap and Greeneville, and that their movement has been suspended for several days past, portions of the force returning some miles in this direction since Friday last. Captain King has been assigned to depot commissary duty as Colonel Barriger desired.

J. D. COX.

Acting Chief of Staff.
