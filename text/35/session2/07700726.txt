THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 1,
ordering the main qufetion? Will it preclude
amendment, if the motion to reconsider is agreed
to ?
The SPEAKER. The previous question ex-
tends only to the motion to reconsider.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put.
Mr. MILLSON. The previous question, I be-
lieve, has been ordered, and debate is not in or-
der. I wish, however, to ask the gentleman from
Pennsylvania if he has the slightest expectation
that if this bill passes this House, it will pass the
Senate at this session, or have any effect other
than to delay the public business?
Mr. GROW. This bill has been discussed m
the Senate during the last session, and during the
present, ar.d I think might be passed there with-
out the necessity of further discussion.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I will say to the
gentleman from Virginia that if this bill does not
pass the Senate during the present session it ought
to.
The motion to reconsider was agreed to.
The question recurred on the motion to refer
the bill to the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union.
The motion was disagreed to.
Mr. GROW demanded the previous question.
Mr. MAYNARD. I ask the gentleman to with-
draw his motion for the previous question, to en-
able me to offer an amendment to the bill.
Mr. GROW. I cannot.
Mr. SMITH, of Virginia. 1 rise to a question
of order. I wish to know if it is in order to con-
sider this bill now? In what way docs it get pos-
session of the House ? The reconsideration of
the'vote referring the bill only brings the bill back
to the position which it occupied when the mo-
tion was made; but does it entitle the gentleman
to have it put on its passage ?
The SPEAKER. When the bill was intro-
duced, it was read twice and committed to the
Committee on Agriculture. It was reported back
by the committee, and on motion of thegcntlenmii
from New York [Mr. KelseyJ referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the stale of the Union.
If the House had voted down the motion to com-
mit, the question would then have been on the
engrossment and third reading of the bill.
Mr. GROW. I withdraw the demand for the
previous question, to enable me to offer the fol-
lowing amendment:
Be it further enacted, That from and after the passage of
this act no public land shall he exposed to sale by piocla-
raatiou of the President, unless the same shull have been
surveyed, and the return of such suivey duly filed m the
Land Office tor tPn years or more hefoie such sale: Pro-
vided, however, that wliencvei the President slml! aseeiuiin
that any township or townships of the public lands are pine
or mineral ia'nds', lie shall be authorised to proclaim such
township or townships foi sale, as now provided by law.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I say to the gen-
tleman from Pennsylvania that if he insists on
that amendment, and it is adopted, I shall vote
against the bill.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. So shall I, although
otherwise determined to vote for the bill.
Mr. GROW. I renew my demand for the pre-
vious question.
Mr. MAYNARD. I rise to a question of order.
* I rose and was recognized by the Chair. While
I was upon the floor, I sent an amendment to the
Speaker's table, which I asked should be re-
ported. I have not yielded the floor from that
time to this.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ten-
nessee only held the floor by the courtesy of the
gentleman fiom Pennsylvania.
Mr. MAYNARD. Then I ask the gentleman
from Pennsylvania to extend that courtesy to al-
low my amendment to be read.
Mr. "GROW. At the request of gentlemen
around me, who wish to have a direct vote upon
a naked homestead bill, I withdraw the amend-
ment which 1 offered, and ask for a vote upon
the engrossment and third reading of the bill.
Mr. MAYNARD. Will the gentleman allow
me to have my amendment reported ?
Mr. GROW. I insist upon my demand for
the previous question.
Mr. MORGAN. [ object to the gentleman
withdrawing the demand for the previous ques-
' tion, unless he yields the floor altogether.
Mr. HUGHES. X move to lay the bill on the
table.
The SPEAXiER. The Chair recognizes the
gentleman from Pennsylvania as being entitled
to the floor.
Mr. GROW. Then 1- withdraw the previous
question simply to say that the gentleman from
Ohio wanted to ask 
Mr. HUGHES. I moved to lay this bill upon
the table.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania was upon the floor at the time.
Mr. GROW. I was about to say that when
the motion to reconsider the vote by which the
bill was referred to the Committee of the Whole
on the state of the Union was pending, the gen-
tleman from Ohio desired to ask me a question. I
stated to him that if he would wait a few minutes,
until the bill was before the House, I would hear
his question. I then demanded the previous ques-
tion.
Mr. MORGAN. I object to any question.
Mr. VALLANDIGHAM. I desire to ask for
information in regard to this bill; and I hope the
gentleman from New York will withdraw his ob-
jection.
Mr. MORGAN.- No, sir; I do not.
Mr. GROW. Then I insist on the previous
question.
Mr. ATKINS. I would vote for a proper
homestead bill. But I object to this bill, as do
some of my colleagues, for the reason that it gives
the benefits of its provisions to unnaturalized per-
sons. I desire to know if it would be in order to
strike out the fifth line, in which the benefits of
this bill are extended to unnaturalized persons?
The SPEAKER. It is not in order.
Mr. ATKINS. Then I shall vote against the
bill.
Mr. HUGHES. I move to lay the bill upon
the table.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I call for the read-
ing of the bill.
The bill was read as follows:
A bill to secure homesteads to actual settlers on the^ ublic

Mr. SMITH, of Virginia, called for the yeas
and nays on the motion to lay the bill upon the
table. .
Mr. BRANCH demanded tellers upon the yeas
and nays.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. McQueen

So the House refused to lay the bill upon the
table.
During the call,
Mr. GROW stated that Mr. Sherman, of Ohio,
had paired off with Mr. Bocock; that Mr. Sher-
man was in favor of the bill and Mr. Bocock
opposed to it.
Mr. K^ITT. If this is the time to correct the
record, I desire to call the attention of the House
to the fact that the name of the gentleman from
Tennessee, Mr. Jones, is found in the negative;
the gentleman from Tennessee who usually votes
against all expenditures from the public Treasury.
[Laughter.]
Mr. JONES, ofTennessce. The record is right;
and 1 have made a record which I am willing to
stand by.
The vote was then announced as above re-
corded.
Mr. MAYNARD. I appeal to the gentleman
from Pennsylvania to withdraw the call for the
previous question, until the amendment I desire
to offer can be read.
Mr. GROW. I cannot withdraw it. If the
House wants to vote it down, they can do so.
The previous question was seconded, and the
main question ordered to be put; and under the
operation thereof, the bill was ordered to be en-
j grossed and read a third time; and being en-
; grossed, it was accordingly read the third time,
j Mr. GROW. I demand the previous question
i upon the passage of the bill.
