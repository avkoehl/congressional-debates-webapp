TWENTY-FIFTH ARMY CORPS,

March 31, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

There is no evidence of any kind up to this moment that anything but three brigades of Pickett's division have left my front since to-day. I have a scouting party out on my right now and will send you report as soon as it returns. Richmond papers, secured a few moments ago, say that Sheridan, with cavalry, infantry, and artillery, is evidently trying to get to the South Side Railroad. I have sent you the papers. I am using every method to get information and as soon as I can report any change I will so at once. The lines in my front here show no change whatever and General Hartsuff reports none in his. Please let me know if you hear anything of Hampton's [Hunton's?] brigade, Pickett's division, or of Field's division.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

DABNEY'S MILL, [Marc] 31, 1865.

Major-General WEITZEL:

All of Pickett's division is here. We have prisoners from Hunton's brigade and I believe all other brigades of the division. Nothing has been seen of any of Field's or Kershaw's divisions, nor of Mahone's.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

DABNEY'S MILL, March 31, 1865.

(Received 10.45 p.m.)

Major-General WEITZEL:

Mahone's division is reported here this evening. This leaves, as I understand, Field, Kershaw, and Bratton holding in front of you, including your Bermuda front.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

MARCH 31, 1865-10.45 p.m.

Via City Point.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT:

My scouting party has just returned. It reports the enemy's line unchanged as far as Charles City road. Could not get across White Oak Swamp to Williamsburg road on account of high water in swamp. I have nothing further new.

G. WEITZEL,

Major-General.

MARCH 31, 1865-10.11 a.m.

Brigadier-General DEVENS:

General Grant thinks some troops have left our front. Have you any such information? We think here nothing more than a brigade of Mahone's division left.

G. F. SHEPLEY,

Chief of Staff.
