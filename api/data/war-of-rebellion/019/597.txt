Brigadier General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD:

Lieutenant Piper, with 60 of Merrill's Horse, attacked and routed 200 guerrillas near Paris, killing and wounding several and capturing arms and horses. Pursued them until scattered, making farther pursuit fruitless, and then returned to their camp and ate their dinners, which was cooking at the time of the attack.

SAINT LOUIS, MINN., August 26, 1862-7 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

When the Indian outbreak was first known here, on the 20th instant, I at once called upon the people everywhere to mount horses and with what arms they had to march to the scene of difficulty. Hundreds have done so, and they should be mustered as well as can be at once, and I would suggest Major Howard Stansbury, a retired officer of the Regular Army, resident here, for that purpose, and report to me.

ALEX. RAMSEY.

SAINT PAUL, MINN., August 26, 1862-10 p.m.

President LINCOLN:

With the concurrence of Commissioner Dole I have telegraphed the Secretary of War for an extension of one month of drafting, &amp;c. The Indian outbreak has come upon us suddenly. Half the population of the State are fugitives. It is absolutely impossible that we should proceed. The Secretary of War denies our request. I appeal to you, and ask for an immediate answer. No one not here can conceive the panic in the State.

ALEX. RAMSEY,

Governor of Minnesota.
