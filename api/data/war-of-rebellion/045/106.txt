Major-General HOOKER:

Your dispatch received. The 15, 000 infantry and artillery at Culpeper I consider to be made up in good part by the force taken back by Longstreet from Gaines' Cross-Roads. He took back a number of wagons, but no artillery of any consequence.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

General Howard is at Centreville now, General Doubleday at Kettle Run, and will push on to Manassas to night. General Meade at Catlett's, and General Birney will be here to- night. General Meade will move to Centreville to-morrow, and General Birney to Manassas. I will leave one corps at Manassas, to cover the crossing of the Occoquan. How is Pleasonton to know when General Hancock withdraws from Falmouth, that he may withdraw his pickets?

Please telegraph Pleasonton if you can.
