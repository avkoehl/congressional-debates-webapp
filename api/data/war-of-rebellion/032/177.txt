ment at New Madrid, Mo., and removing the United States troops from that place to Fort Pillow. He is not only free from culpability, but is honorably acquitted of all blame.

Neither Brigadier General Thomas A. Davies, U. S. Volunteers, nor Colonel John Scott, Thirty-second Regiment of Iowa Volunteers, should be dismissed the service of the United States.

There being no further business to transact, the Special Commission adjourned sine die.

Findings approved.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS POST OF COLUMBUS,Columbus, Ky., September 1, 1863.

COLONEL: A Military Commission, of which Brigadier General W. K. Strong was president, was convened in Saint Louis in February last, by order of Major-General Halleck, to investigate as to the evacuation of New Madrid and destruction of property there and at Island Numbers 10.

Grave charges were preferred against me, as commanding officer, for the evacuation of New Madrid, under alleged "pretended orders," and I was in arrest for two months. On the finding of that Commission, I was ordered to duty by General Curtis, but the finding was not made public, nor has been to this time, to my knowledge.

Feeling that my arrest was an outrage, and that the Commission fully justified my action, I deem myself entitled to a copy of the finding. I have applied for it heretofore in vain.

I respectfully ask that the major-general commanding the department will secure me a copy of the finding of said Commission.

Your most obedient servant,

JOHN SCOTT,

Colonel Thirty-second Iowa Infantry, Commanding Post.

Colonel JOHN A. RAWLINS, Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF TENNESSEE,Vicksburg, Miss., September 14, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded to Headquarters of the Army, Washington, D. C., with the request that, if deemed proper, Colonel Scott be furnished with a copy of such part of the proceedings as interest him.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

OCTOBER 3, 1863.

I see no objection to the Adjutant-General furnishing Colonel Scott with the opinion of the court of inquiry in his case.*

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.
