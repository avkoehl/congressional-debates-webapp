marching orders (leaving camp guards) t 7 o'clock a. m. to-morrow, and will all have breakfasted before that hour.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Colonel E. D. BAKER, Commanding Third Brigade.

The above order was sent by the hands of Captain Candy, assistant adjutant-general, who left Edwards Ferry at about 11.30 o'clock p. m. on the 20th. As the distance to Colonel Baker's camp was between 4 and 5 miles, and as many guards and pickets had to be passed, it is probable that the order was delivered between 1 and 2 o'clock a. m., 21st October. This order was followed by a verbal one, sent by Dr. J. S. Mackie, volunteer aide-de-camp, cautioning Colonel Baker not to allow his troops to march with music, but to have the mach silent as possible; and to prevent accidental discharge of fire-arms, he was ordered to see that the men marched with unloaded arms.

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS CORPS OF OBSERVATION,Edwards Ferry, October 21 - 11.50

Colonel E. D. BAKER, Commanding Brigade:

COLONEL: I am informed that the force of the enemy is about 4,000, all told. If you can push them, you may do so as far as to have a strong position near Leesburg, if you can keep them before you, avoiding their batteries. If they pass Leesburg and take the Gum Spring road you will not follow far, but seize the first good position to cover that road. Their design is to draw us on, if they are obliged to retreat, as far as Goose Creek, where they can be re-enforced from Manassas and have a strong position.

Report frequently, so that when they are pushed Gorman can come in on their flank.

Yours, respectfully, and truly,

CHAS. P. STONE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
