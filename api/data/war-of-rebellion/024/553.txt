HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., January 2, 1863.

Brig. Gen. J. C. SULLIVAN,

Jackson, Tenn.:

You have done a fine job-retrieved all lost at Trenton and north of you. I sent a fine regiment of cavalry to you. They left here on the 31st. Clear out West Tennessee of all roving cavalry. If it is necessary, mount as much infantry as you think necessary. What do you estimate the loss on each side?

Dodge is now our after Forrest's band.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

Number 4. Report of Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll, Eleventh Illinois Cavalry, of skirmish at Lexington.

JACKSON, TENN., December 27, 1862.

I have the honor to report that in accordance with orders received from you I proceeded toward the Tennessee River on the evening of the 16th instant with one section of Captain Kidd's Fourteenth Indiana Battery, under Lieutenant McGuire, and 200 of the Eleventh Illinois Cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Meek.

At noon we marched to Beech Creek, about 5 miles east of Lexington. Three days before, Captain O'Hara had been sent to Tennessee River with 68 men.
