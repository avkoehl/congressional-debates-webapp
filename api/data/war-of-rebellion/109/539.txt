Brigadier General W. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the Cumberland.

GENERAL: My scouts from the top of Lookout Mountain have returned. Mr. Botmann, a Union man, told them that a brother of his wife, who is in the Third Confederate Cavalry was at his house with fifty men. He told her that they were hunting a good road to Bridgeport and were sent to find out the strength of our forces at Wauhatchie, Whiteside's and Bridgeport; that they could not accomplish their mission as we had too much cavalry in the valley, some citizen bringing them news that we had 200 men mounted; that they had 60,000 men at Dalton and that the whole rebel army would probablybb cross Lookout Mountain soon. Mr. Botmann will be in Chattanooga to-morrow. Nothing further heard from the reconnaissance.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD.

Major-General.
