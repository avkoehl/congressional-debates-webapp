driven by a series of brilliant charges from about a dozen well-built rail barricades. A number of prisoners and about 100 stand of arms were captured. At Tobesofkee Creek the rebels, about 300 strong, were posted at the east end of the bridge, which they had fired, and had also torn up a portion of the planking. Their sharpshooters were lying behind rail barricades, and about a dozen occupied a stone mill about 100 yards below the bridge. The advance went on to the bridge at a gallop, but were stopped by the planking having been taken off. They quickly dismounted and crossed on the burning stringers in the most gallant manner, routed the enemy, and saved the bridge, which is an important one, being over 100 yards long. About three miles from Tobesofkee Creek the advance was met by Brigadier-General Robertson, of the rebel army, with a flag of truce, bearing a dispatch from General Cobb, stating that an armistice had been agreed on between General Sherman and the rebel General Johnston. This document was delivered by General Robertson to Captain Lewis, of my staff, and his receipt taken therefor. Captain Lewis handed me the dispatch, when I directed him to inform General Robertson that I had sent it by special messenger to General Wilson, and that I required him (General Robertson) to return to Macon immediately and await the reply. General Robertson declined receiving the message from Captain Lewis and demanded that it should be in writing. General Robertson's course led me to believe that he was merely endeavoring to delay my column. He had already succeeded in doing so for nearly an hour, and I feared that I would be unable to save the bridge over Rocky Creek. I therefore wrote him as follows:
HDQRS. SECOND DIV., CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Macon, Ga., April 20, 1865.

GENERAL: I have received the dispatch from General Cobb and have sent it by special messenger to Major-General Wilson, a few miles in my rear. As there may be some delay in receiving an answer, it is necessary for your to return immediately to Macon, to which place General Wilson's reply will be forwarded. I have directed the officer commanding my advance to move forward five minutes after this is handed you.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

ROBT. H. G. MINTY,

Colonel, Commanding Division.

I directed Colonel White to give the flag of truce five minutes' start, and then to push forward, and if General Robertson and his party did not keep out of his way to take them prisoners. After the expiration of the given time Colonel White pushed rapidly forward, succeeded in saving the bridge, which the rebels were about to burn, and continuing his pursuit, entered Macon with them. The city and defenses were immediately surrendered by Major-General Cobb. Our captures were 5 general and 345 other officers, 1,843 enlisted men, and 60 pieces of artillery. I beg to refer your o the reports of Lieutenant-Colonel Pritchard, Fourth Michigan Cavalry, and Lieutenant-Colonel White, Seventeenth Indiana (mounted) Infantry, which are inclosed herewith.* Both of these officers are deserving of promotion for the gallant and soldier-like manner in which they have performed their duties. Captain Hudson, Fourth Michigan Cavalry; Major Weiler, Lieutenant McDowell, and Lieutenant Dolye, of the Seventeenth Indiana (mounted Infantry, are also deserving of promotion for their gallantry. Herewith I also hand you the report* of Captain Robinson, Chicago Board of Trade
