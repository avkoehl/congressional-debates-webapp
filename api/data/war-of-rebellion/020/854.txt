30-pounders are old 24-pounders reamed up and fitten with grape and canister to fire small charges. Old carronades and different pattern howitzers are fitted up to command the roads and approaches. The whole number of guns now mounted in the above-described positions is one hundred and fifty-three, including the field pieces. The supply of ammunition is sufficient, each gun having from 200 to 50 rounds, according to its position. The works do credit to the engineer department and the ordnance officer. Lieutenant Cunningham has shown great resource in creating supplies and importing the condition of the ordnance stores. The Navy Department have, besides the State of Georgia before mentioned, the iron-clad steamer Atlanta, now at Thunderbolt, and the Savannah, just built and put in commission, will soon be ready for service. These vessels make powerful moving batteries,and add much tot he defenses of the approaches by water.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Inspector Artillery and Ordnance.
