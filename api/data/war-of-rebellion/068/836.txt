General GILLMORE:

Your dispatch notifying me that my order as to your position and the two regiments is received. you received no order from me or any member of my staff to "fall back from intrenchments" till after you had sent me a dispatch that you were falling back on two roads. upon comparing dates Colonel Kensel did not leave with the order to "hold the roads" until after your dispatch was received, and the order he carried was originally written "why falling back?"
