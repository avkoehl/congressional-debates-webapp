NASHVILLE, January 20, 1864.

Brigadier General ROBERT ALLEN,

Louisville, Ky.:

My visit to Louisville has to be deferred on account of news from the front, making it necessary for me to go there. Is it possible to get additional rolling-stock forward? Foster must be supplied almost exclusively henceforth by this route.

Brigadier-General CROOK,

Huntsville, Ala.:

The following dispatch just received via Nashville from General Dodge:

PULASKI, January 19, 1864.

[Lieutenant-Colonel BOWERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:]

A force of mine started from 6 miles west of Florence yesterday. They found one regiment of Roddey's on this side of the Tennessee foraging. All reports of prisoners, scouts, and citizens show that Roddey has and is building flats and hiding them in Little Bear Creek, where he now has over twenty; also in spring and Town Creeks, with one near Courtland. He has several in each of these creeks, and has been over two months building them. Roddey has about 1,600 effective men.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.

You will organize an expedition at once of sufficient force and proceed without delay by the most practicable route and drive Roddey out from where he now is, and destroy all boats and materials you can find that might in any contingency be used by the enemy in crossing the Tennessee River.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

PULASKI, TENN.,

January 20, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT,

Nashville:

Colonel Johnson with about 800 men is down in the Colbert Reserve, west of Florence; part of his force was in Lexington and Lawrenceburg yesterday. I think they are mostly after stock and forage.

I have no mounted forces except those left from the veterans, and they are too small to do much good. I will watch him pretty close.

G. M. DODGE,

Brigadier-General.
