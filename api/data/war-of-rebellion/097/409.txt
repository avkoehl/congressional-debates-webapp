SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-11.20 p.m. [Received 11.35 p.m.]

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I understand my orders to be to push General Miles down the White Oak road to join Sheridan if he has not by 12 o'clock started the enemy or broken through their lines, and that I am not to await any further orders from General Meade upon that subject. Let me know if I am right. It takes much time to communicate with General Miles, he is so distant.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, April 1, 1865-11.40 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Your construction of the order in reference to Miles' movement is correct. Has he advanced any? Of course if he is about advancing, or in the act of attacking, I don't understand the precise order is to halt him. The order was predicated on the supposition he could have settled the question in his front by that time.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, April 1, 1865-11.55 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

I have received no report from General Miles since I sent him your first orders to attack. There is firing now on his front by fits and starts. He must have advanced. The officer who took him the last order has not returned. He was directed to wait and bring back a report of the conditions of things. Their artillery has opened on Miles. They cheer from time to time in their works, but the cheering is not extensive.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.

APRIL 1, 1865.

General HUMPHREYS,

Second Corps:

General Meade directs that corps commanders will take their time from these headquarters in order to insure uniformity to-morrow.

A. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.

[Same to General Wright, Sixth Corps, and General Parke, Ninth Corps.]
