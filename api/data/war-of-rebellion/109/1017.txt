only forwarded as perhaps corroborative of other information. As it was presumed that General Chambliss' scouts would give quicker and more reliable information of the enemy's movements, this party was directed not to ho farther than sufficient to determine the truth of the report above alluded to. The reports of the stragglers we have picked up (some twenty in number) correspond generally with this report, with the addition that General Grant iis moving to Harrison's Landing to cross to the south side.

SPOUT SPRING, June 14, 1864.

General BRAGG:

I am at Spout Spring, eighteen miles east of Lynchburg. The Yankees burnt the depot at Concord last night. I have just received a letter from the agent at Concord who states they were from 500 to 1,000 strong and left in the direction of Campbell Court-House to capture General Longstreet.

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Cavalry still report the enemy steadily advancing. Nothing but cavalry been seen that I can hear of. General Heth has sent Cooke's brigade down the road to try and ascertain whatt iis the truth.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS,June 15, [1864]-6.30 p. m.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: Cooke drove the enemy to Smith's Store. About 4 o'clock Colonel Gary passed down with two regiments of cavalry and informed me that General W. H. F. Lee was coming up the road from Malvern to take the enemy in rear. General Heth then took Davis' brigade, and with Cooke and the cavalry waited to hear General Lee's attack before pitching in. Nothing having been heard from General Lee, General Heth has been directed to withdraw his brigade. The cavalry are following the enemy who are returning. Cooke has taken prisoners from seven regiments, and thinks it was Wilson's division of cavalry. I have taken a new line, with my left resting so as to cover the White Oak Swamp bridge, with a regiment and battery on the other side, and my right covering the Willis Church road. The line is a very defensible one.

Respectfully,

A. P. HILL,

Lieutenant-General.
