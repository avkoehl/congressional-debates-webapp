HEADQUARTERS, HICKORY PLAINS,June 22, 1864-12 m. (Via Brownsville.)

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I start northward in half an hour. I am out of forage and provisions and shall have to get along the best way I can. I sent the detachment of the Eleventh Missouri back to the Bluff, and I have ordered the detachment of the Tenth Illinois to Little Rock. In consequence of the scarcity of provisions and the bad condition of the horses' feet I have also ordered about one-third of the Ninth Iowa to Bayou Two Prairies. This will leave me about 400 men, which I consider sufficient to clear this country to Little Rock.

LEWISBURG, June 22, 1864.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Major Lovejoy had returned from scout in Perry County. There was to have been a meeting at Doctor Hill's plantation on Saturday last for the purpose of organizing the citizens in that vicinity, and after harvest to join Connelly's company, who is now in vicinity of Danville with about 50 men. They are the only organized force over there at the present time. Major Lovejoy went over last Thursday night and Friday morning with 80 dismounted men, marching 25 miles first day over the Petit Jean Mountains, in order to surprise the enemy, but news of their coming was carried to Hill by a man named Burroughs, a citizen who has taken the oath. The major captured 2 prisoners; the rest of the gang escaped. The men marched 80 miles of mountain country and returned completely worn out.

Respectfully,

A. H. RYAN,

Colonel, Commanding Post.
