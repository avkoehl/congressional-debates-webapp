1857.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
31
His fearless sincerity, his noble bearing, his
purity of character, bis surpassingeloquence, and
his exalted patriotism, were the theme of admir-
ing friends; while his rich store of humor, his fine
imagination, and his wide range of legal and con-
stitutional knoicledge, made him both acommand-
ing Senator and a universal favorite in the social
circlc.
His mind was lifted far above the level of sec-
tional prejudice or local sentiment. Deeply im-
bued with the spit it of law and justice, his impar-
tial judgment was swayed only by the dictates of
honor and duty.
Whilst his great mental powers were naturally
devoted to his own native State, he loved the
whole Union, and was emphatically a Senator
belonging and endeared to the whole country,
anxiously watching every opportunity to promote
its welfare and to exalt its position among the
nations of the world.
He has left us in the strength of his manhood,
and in the midst of his usefulness; but—
" Is it not better to die willingly
Than linger till the glass be all outrun ?"
The resolutions were unanimously adopted;
and the Senate adjourned.
