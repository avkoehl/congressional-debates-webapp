policy.] " Why is it that -we do not hear coming up
from that State the cry of outrages which wehsar
coming up from other southern States? Because in
that State the Republican partv has risen to the de-
mands of the occasion, has placed upon record and
adopted as part of its platform a declaration in favor
of general amnesty to all the people of Virginia,
and the repeal of all these obnoxious relies of the
rebellion."
My colleague refers to outrages committed
by violence, by lawlessness. Well, I believe
there has been a cessation of outrages of this
character, but it is by no means attributable
to the cause stated by my colleague. I do not
think, at least I have not heard, that any Ke-
publicans have been murdered in Virginia, or
otherwise violently used on account of their
political faith, for the past ten months, with
the exception of the murders committed in
Norfolk, under the eye of my colleague in his
late canvass. But there is a cry of outrages
constantly coming up from the State of Vir-
ginia. I marvel that my colleague does not
hear it ringing in his ears all the while. The
wail of the oppressed ! I hear it by day and
by night. These outrages in Virginia are as
atrocious and cruel as the midnight and red-
handed murders which are now covering the
soil of other southern States with the dead
bodies of loyal men.
Does not my colleague know full well that
the loyal people of Virginia cannot obtain jus-
tice in the courts of the State? Does he not
know that civil and criminal causes are daily
decided against Republicans because they are
Republicans? Does he not know that colored
men, in a colored population of six hundred
thousand, are excluded from the jury-box be-
cause they are colored, and contrary to the
express provision of the State constitution?
Does he not know that since the close of the
war it is a common practice to sentence colored
men and even women, when charged with mur-
der, to death, upon evidence so slight and
insufficient that it ought not to " hang a dog."
Does he not know that they are being daily
sentenced to the penitentiary upon insufficient
or no evidence at, all, and that every time the
prison doors close upon the form of one of the
poor, trembling wretches, the loaders of the
Conservative party chuckle, "Another vote lost
to the Radical party?" And finally, does not
my colleague know that there is no tyranny,
no oppression, no outrage, more terrible and
cruel than that which is wrought through the
forms of law?
Mr. Speaker, I have but a few more words
to say. How shall the House judge between
my colleague and myself? lie asserts that
the Republican party of Virginia are, at the
present time, in favor of universal amnesty ;
while I claim they arc not, unless at the same
time Congress shall pass laws protecting the
loyal people in their rights. I certainly should
have every reason to acknowledge that the
Republican party in Virginia was in favor of
universal amnesty if I thought such was the
case, and no reason whatever to conceal it.
I do not think I have any prejudices which
would prevent me from comprehending that
they were in favor of amnesty if such was the
fact. I run a great risk if my colleague has
correctly interpreted the sentiment of the
Republican party, for I would be placing my-
self in opposition to the entire people of the
State. Sir, can you not see that it is far more
pleasant for a Republican Representative from
the South to advocate amnesty than to oppose
it? Does it not render his personal and social
relations far more agreeable; and does it not
give him the reputation of being a generous,
magnanimous, sublime being, and all that?
Sir, the path of duty and stern justice lies in
a, different direction, and I for one shall con-
tinue to follow it without a murmur. In the
mean time 1 shall bo, as heretofore, liberal as
the most liberal in removing political disabili-
ties nnder the fourteenth ameudmeul in all
proper cases.
Sundry Civil Bill.
REMARKS OP HON. O. D. CONGER,
of michigan,
In the House op Representatives,
February 27, 1871,
On the following amendment reported from the
Committee on Appropriations to the sundry civil
appropriation bill:
Amend sundry civil expenses bill by inserting in
section two, after line fifty-five, the following:
For the erection of a Government building at Port
Huron, Michigan, upon plans which will insure its
completion for the sum of $200,000, the half of which
is hereby appropriated, $100,000.
" Ioughtalsoto state that.since making the recom-
mendation for Grand Rapids my attention has been
called to the importance of a custom-house at Port
Huron. The business and revenues of that place are
increasing rapidly, and the erection of a custom-
house cannot, properly be delayed for any consider-
able time. Under the circumstances, I suggest the
expediency of malting an appropriation for Port
Huron also."—Secretary of the Treasury.
Mr. CONGER. Mr. Speaker, I ask the
attention of the House for a moment to the
statement which I submit in regard to the
necessity of a custom-house and bonded ware-
house at Port Huron, Michigan.
The Huron district was formed of a part
of the Detroit district, somewhat over four
years ago, and the statements added will
show how large an interest has grown up in
this new district, making it now the most
important, in many respects, of any in the
Northwest. With a shore-line of more than
five hundred miles, embracing part of Lake
St. Clair, all of St. Clair river, the Saginaw
bay and river, and all of Lake Huron within
the United States, and being the port of entry
for all the merchandise of the St. Lawrence
and Portland trade to the western States and
the Red River country, it has no custom house
building, no bonded warehouse building, and
all the bonded goods for Milwaukee, Chicago,
Cincinnati, St. Louis, Red river, and other
interior parts are now kept in wooden flour
sheds, exposed to fire, theft, and damage.
As this is the most northern point on this
continent where railroad crossing is practi-
cable in the lake region, it must always be of
great commercial importance in the transit of
goods and the interchange of land and water
communication. The Grand Trunk railway
from Portland, and from Quebec, by way of
Montreal and Toronto and Buffalo, and the
Great Western railway from Niagara Falls,
coming to our border at this point, and the
Grand Trunk and Port Huron and Lake Mich-
igan railways connecting them with the South-
west and West, and, in course of time, with
the Northern Pacific by the Straits of Macki-
naw, together with the vast fleet of vessels
and steam craft passing up and down the St.
Clair river, amounting, even now, in the num-
ber of passing trips, to more than twenty-five
thousand in a single season of navigation,
render the erection of a suitable building for
a custom-house and bonded warehouse a mat-
ter of public necessity, which ought not to be
longer delayed, and for which the Committee
on Appropriations has wisely provided in this
bill. It is not a matter of mere local import-
ance, but concerns the commercial interests
of the East and West.
I give an abstract of some of the principal
items for the lijst four years, from 1867 to 1870,
both inclusive:
District of Huron, Michigan.
Value of imports $2,407,699 00
Value of exports  7,203,563 00
.Duties on importations, (coin)  583,082 43
Duties on importations to Red river  336,265 57
ices, tonnaget ax, hospital dues, &c  96,744 89
Aggregate of duties, feos, &c  1,016,092 89
iN umber of entries of imports  27,082
Kntrios and clearances of vessels  39,360
Number of immigrants  156,693
Number of passages of vessels  100,144
I send to the reporters the following state-
ments, (Nos. 1 and 2,} giving more particular
information; which I ask may be printed with
these remarks:
[No. 1.}
[From the Port Huron Times of January 20,1870, j
Customs.—Table showing the imports and exports^
amount of duties collected, and other business trans-
acted at the port of Port Ifuron, since October 1,186#.
We give below tables showing the business trans-
acted in the collection district of Huron since Octo-
ber 1, 1866. The steady increase of the business of
this port is a matter for general congratulation, a 
this business contributes in no small degree to the
growth and prosperity of the city itself, and is an
indication of the increasing importance of Port Hu-
ron as a commercial point. The district of Huron
was organized on the 1st of October, 1866, and com-
prises a lake and river coast-line of about five hun-
dred miles; but nearly all the imports and exports
pass through the port ofPortHuron.
The following is the table, as copied from the
official records:
