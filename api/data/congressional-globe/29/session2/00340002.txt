Mr. REID rose to oiler an amendment to tiie
oi initial lesolution; I nt
Tiie SPEAKER having ruled his amendment
OUt of O>•<!'">!'—
Air. RE! D contended that, as the amendment
proposed to sLiiiiio out the o'luina^ resolution and
vii'tuji'v to insert a. ^ub'-ititiui:, it wus ]) irhamen-
tary to perfect the original resolution i.'Ter'- the
qu,jsr.on should he U;keu on the sui;slu-.Ue; i>ut
ti'o Onair insisted on hs jticir nent.
So the resolution proposed by Air. Re id was
not received.
The yefs a-'d nays bcin^ oy/iered on Mr.

tesaois.
And on the question being taken by yeas and
nays upon the proposed amendment, it was de-
cided in the negative: Yeas 80, nays 113.

iccted.

posed by Mr. Andrew Johnson; and, being put,
it was decided in the negative.
So the amendment was rejected.
Mr. RE[D moved to amend the resolution of Mr..
Cobb, by adding at the end thereof the following:
Provided, That if any member shall be known
to be detained on his way to this City by the ill-
ness of himself or family, or other unavoidable

p offered by Mr. Cobb, and it was agreed to.

;! forming the flouse that the Senate had appointed
Mess/s. Breese, Crit-ienden, and Fairfield, a
;1 committee on its part to wait on the President.

! ceed to execute the order of the House by placing
;! in a box the name of each member and delegate
upon a separate piece of paper, and drawing them
H out, one at a time, until all tiie names were drawn,
jl each member choosing his scat as his name was
