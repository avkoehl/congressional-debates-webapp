HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Sain Louis, April 7, 1862.

Brigadier General FRED. STEELE:

The concentration of enemy's forces at Jacksonport and Pocahontas render it perilous for you to advance farther south than Pitman's Ferry. I send you a pontoon train to enable you to operate on Black and Current Rivers. Push your reconnaissance in direction of Salem and White River to connect with General Curtis, who is moving from Forsyth towards Salem. The enemy is reported to be in considerable force at Yellville. If the attempts to move between you, operate against his flank.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, April 7, 1862.

Captain W. D. PORTER, U. S. N.,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

CAPTAIN: Flag-Officer Foote, commanding flotilla in Western waters, has designated you to take charge of fitting out two gunboats to be purchased at this place. It is proposed that they be altered as to serve the double purpose of gunboats and rams. The Quartermaster's Department will purchase the boats under your direction and supply all the necessary means for fitting them out.

It is expected that the work will be pushed forward with all possible dispatch.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, April 7, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

General Denver goes to Indian Territory, Sturgis to Kansas, and General Craig to Overland Mail Route. Until General Brice is confirmed I have no one to command New Mexico expedition. Flag-Officer Foote has designated Captain Porter to direct the fitting out of new gunboats. I shall probably leave on the morning of the 9th for Tennessee. General Buell's advance guard has reached Grant. Entire force will connect in two or three days. I will write you about dispositions of Generals Curtis and Steele.
