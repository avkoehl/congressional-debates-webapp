HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 29, 1863-10 a. m.

General SEDGWICK:

Since my first report of this morning, General Wadsworth threw over in boats one of his brigades, and the engineers are now building the bridges.

They say they will have the bridge in order in one hour, which means two. Hope to get one finished as soon as possible. We took probably 40 or 50 prisoners out of the rifle-pit.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

JOHN F. REYNOLDS,

Major-General Volunteers, Commanding.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Major General D. BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The enemy are moving wagon trains to their rear. Their force which is in position opposite our crossings is very light; I should judge not more than we now have across the river.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief of Aeronauts, Army of the Potomac.

GENERAL: About two regiments of the enemy's infantry have just moved forward from the heights and entered the rifle-pits opposite our lower crossing.

Heavy smokes are visible about 6 miles up the river, on the opposite side, in the woods.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief of Aeronauts, Army of the Potomac.
