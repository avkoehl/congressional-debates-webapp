^iry atl ibis tune, and tbe manner of using such an
immense power, which must also, under the Con-
stitution, b  a proper one, ¡*, by ih s bill, after all
our r-cent experience, manifestly left in several im-
portmt respects dangerou , injurious,  and highly
improper
But passing by all these considerations as to the
unconsa utionahty of ihe measure—founded whe-
th«r on the bro&d ground first noticed, that no
banking corporation whatever is admissible, or on
the other, that non  with a large capital for dis-
counts and circulation is not/ either necessary or
proper—I hapten to the consideration, that if a
b*nk of the latter character be cons tutional, it is
not cxpet'ien', and hence that my motion to strike
out the capital ought to prevail
I consider such a Bank as this, with an enor-
moj , capital, and subject to be increased still fur-
ther, as not expedient at itiis time Because we
know, by actual expenme v, that a fiscal agent can
bp dtvised, and p oveifficient lor all mere fiscal
purposes, without n This has been =hown by the
inipppnrent Treasurr, as well as bv th° btate
banks from 1789 to 1792, from 1811 to 1817, and
fron 1833 to 1839 Because the Gtovt-inment
shou d not r m m debt (i an immense capital,
which is not necessary, and which may not be pro
fitable, but even lost, besides inflicting, through its
political and speculating uses, evils on the coun-
try, ncalculable in amount and dmation—because
Any new institution 1 , by 1 s provisions, forbidden

great improvpffients a «holer time rnisut di close,
and howevei much the public mter^slo might ap-
pear to demand a change.
How lift e bet er is this, in principle, than it
woul 1 be t ■> make the charier perpetua , and thus
attempt to t e up, m a sort of en ail or mortmain,
forever, a most odious monopoly in one of the
greatest interests in society
Inexpedient—
Becau e it is a party  mpasure, as be'bre   ex
pla ned, and will aggravate, in a tenfold degree, all
party acrimony, virulence,  and  derangement of
great public interests
Because it wid not ma! e the suspended banks
resurre as it po esses *io means to operate on
them, but will dra n tf th°n torn and embarrass
