APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Oct. 1838.
25th Co\g-*-*£ni> Sess.
Independent Treasury—Mr, Legare 
H. of Reps,
Mr LEGARE addressed the committee, m substance, aa
follows
Mr Chaisman I do not know how I can more appropriate
íy begin the iemaikuld.md.buut to make than m the very words
with which a most able Eighsn wnter addressed himself to
the cause and character ol the recent crisis The events [says
Mr Samuel Jones Lloyd, in a pamphlet published last spring]
which have occuued, m connection with the late pressure, up
on. the moneyed and mercantile interests, are full oí instructive
lllu&trationsoi the effects, both beneficial and othei wise, ol our
present system, and the evilcousequ^nces of this pleasure w li
be &* nothing eompaied wnlms benefits, if amongst these We
s'iail he enabled tuieckon an increased degiee oi intelligence
upon subjects connected with currency, and a nearer approxi
ma! on to sound principies m the management of our paper it.
sues Tne tevulaion, it is ti ue has been far mote disastrous on
this siJe of the Atlantic than in England, and yet even at its
darkest period—now, aa I confidently believe, passed away to
give place to returning prosperity—I found consolation in the
idea, thatdeaily ad we weie buying oui experience in this im
portant matter, the price would not be too high for the benefits
we should ultimately dem e from our res erses A national vi
ertation ought to oe considered as a great providential lesion
It teaches the most momentous  truths, and it teaches them in
ue most impressive man lei, and what we have recently seen
and felt will dispose us -if any thing can dispose us—to look
the difficulties, with which this subject is surrounded, fairly in
the face
Sir, u is surrounded with difficulties Even in England, aa
you perceive from the citation I have just made, they die felt
an i acknowledged by the most able men I have upoa my
desk many other proofs of the same fact They abound, for in
btance, m the minutes of evidence taken before the committee
of the House of Commons on the renewal of the charter of the
Bank of England, in 1832 You will find there that while high
uu honties* agree m thinking that there shwuid be but one Bank
of issue foi the capital, at least, if not for the who e coumry,
the lepr^Bentatives of the great commit cial and manufacturi g
interests on the coitraiy, piotest ag-tinst the continuance of a
monopoly io which they impute tne most sinister influents
o/er then immense business t and demand a sybtem of joint
block banks, regulated by principles more agreeable, as they
contend, to the couise and policy oí trade A third party in
sists upon the neces&ity of compelling all banks of issue to give
adequate security to the public (in Government stock, &r ) foi
the redemption of their issues,? while eveiy stockholder or
partnei shall continue to be, as at piet>ent, responsible for all
the debts of the company to the whole amount of his private
futtune A fourth (and Í have just received from London a lit
tie volume in which that opinion is most plausibly maintained)
utges the most unlimited freedom in banking, and sees nomoie
danger to society from perfect liberty m this than in any other
bianch of business, the supplying, for example, the market of
a great capital with the necessaries of life § In this complexity
and distraction of English opinwn upon this subject, however,
ail paities agree m one thing, and that is, in adheung io the pa
per system nobody there thinks of anv thing so extravagant
as the overthrow of that system, whatever defects may be seen
or supposed to exist in it, or whatever projects may have been
im igmed to purity, to coriect, and to improve it
But if such is the state of English opinion in regard to this
subject, how hiust it be with «a, when to all the intrinsic ditficul-
t esof the thing itself we add those arising out of the complicated
structure of our \ olmcsl institutions'* It would be hard enough
to say what ought to he done, m the present emergency, were
thu a fcimoh? consolid tted Gov eminent, but how much harder is
it to advise the administra) ion oi^federal Government as to the
course it ought to pursue, where one happens to doubt us pos
sessing all the power necessary togivecomplete íelief, without a
co npeiation of others For, sir, it the risk of being set down in
thatcategoiy of "tiny politicians" of whom the gentleman
irom Maiyhnd, [Mr Wm Cost Johnson,} m avery amusing
speech, in the course of which, howevei, he uttered somesrave
ani important tiuths, spoke last night with «¡u^h profound con
tempt, I must confers I agree with the Executive in the gene
ral principles of constitutional law involved in the message
In the division of the attributes oí sovereignty between this Go
vernment and the States, it may and must happen that we
bhould experience sometimes a cha&m, and sometimes a con
diet of poweis Mora is taken from the Estates, perhaps, than
has been given, to the Confederacy, neither can do enough,
while eacn can do too much, for periect harmony, delects dis
ciepancies, and contradictions, exist in the scheme itseli, de
tected only in along course of practice, and which nothing but
practical skill, the wisdom called foi and ca'Ied forth m the ma
nasrementol great affairs, especially political affair?, can recon
cile and tec ify Undoubtedly, the taekis ai immensely difli
culk one—but it must be undertaken, and it must be done The
subject be An e the commit ee is an example of the high, and dif
hcult duties I refer to, nor can I imagine an occasion belter
fitted than this to awaken the House to a lively sen«« of its infi
Mite responsibilities to the country
Judge then, sir, with what deep disappointment and regret I
learned that the bill on the table was to le pies&ed upon us at
this snoi t session It is quite enough for me that it proposes a
great innovation upon the whole course of the Government,
lrom its foundation up to the present moment, and upon all the
habits of our people They who see deeper or clearer into
such matters than 1 do, must pardon me for declaring tha I
cannot conscientiously v>te for the measure in suchha&ie If
I had nopositixe obje' tions to it, it would be quit*- enough foi
me that 1 have not had sufficient time to reflect on it Dunne
this extraordinary session, (for so it has ueen m every sense of
the word) iitigued, harassed, exhausted, by incessant atten
dan «, by night and by day, in this hall, it has not been m my
pow"er to inform myself on any subject as I could have wished
to be able to do I have hadabaOiuiely no time for minute re
search, hai Ily a few hours lor calm reflection Under such
ci cumstances I cannot vote for the bill    I must go home to
Messrs Korsely Palmer, Tooke, Rothschild, &,c
t iiesar& Butt, Smiih, and Dyer of Manches er  It is word y
to remark, that ihese remonstrances were admi tea to be well

my constuuemsand talk with them Many, perhaps most of
them, understand these matters better than I do, but w hen I
le t them although this subject had been discussed, and ably
discussed, here and there, by an individual or two, public at
tention had not been awakened to it, <md nothing like an opi
nion, certainly no opinion favorable to the principle of the bi'l,
had been formed m regard to it
And here, st, I might take my seat again, i! I had risen only
to exp'ain my vote, oi to influence those of others, on the pro
prosed measuie Hut the true issue seems to me very far to
tian^cend, m importance, lhat single measuie, impoitant as it
unquea lonably is It involves m my opinion, the whole credit
system of the country I do not say that the bill on your table
piesents that i^sue—stl< lees that the Executive message pre
sentedu,or piopounded anypnncip'e or opinion that should
lead to it Hut no one who his watched the piogressof this
discussion in this House or in the Senate m or outof ¡hi& Capi-
tol, will deny that it must soon come to that Sir, if there is
any truth at all in what ha  been uiged with gi eat ability, dud all

any idea of rigorously canying out the principles th<y profess,
to then losital consequences, in practice, if what they say in
the highest places, on the most bolemn occasions, is not -uch
idle declamation as such men are not to be suspected of, they
mean that, and nothing short of that Doctrines have been
uttered with all the authon y which can be imparted to para
dox from talent ripened by experience, which seem torn'1 m
consistent with the Constitution not  n!y-of American hut of
all mo lern society, with its whole spirit and tendency, with all
its wants, and all its ways I have sometimes, in the course of
the debates, looked around me to &ee wheie I really was,
whether the shade of "ome old lawgivei, some Mmos orí ycur-
gus, had not been evoked, to bring a degenetate age back to the
¡«tern \ nncipke of Dmuui polity, to an Agrarian equality of
property, to iron money and black broth oi else, if it were not

to the old saw, is the rum oi S'ate , and that sumptuary ana

penmentupon my constituents, it lea*t without receiving an
express instruction to that effect lrom them I am afraid they
have no taste for black btoth, that Spartan discipline will be
irksome, and even revolting to them In short, sir, I have rea
son to believe that, without being as deeply imbue 1, perhaps,
as other people are with the spmtof Ihe age, they do still par
take too m*chof it to he willing to forego the many agreeable
objects that principally engage and excite it
Sir, I am far from denying that, in the eyes of a stern re

is a perverse and crooked one    We love mone), T admit, as

beg you, sir, to believe thatldo not speak in what is called*a
' sectional" spirit, for I pretest before Ood that nothing can be
furtherfrom my heart Butletnot thosewhogemindshavebeen
recently so much inflamed against what they consider as theabo-
m matum of domestic servitude, shut their eyes to the troth. Sir,
I allude to the cultivation of cotton, and its effects, through
the increase of commerce it fosters, upon the condition of so
ciety Whoever shall write the political history of that iava
luable plant will have a more important work w perforin than
has ever fallen to the lot of a biographer of statesmen or phi-
losophers I will venture to say, without gomg more into de
tads, that the single circumstance of bringing the wnnderfuilv
cheap fabrics produced by modern machinery, within the reach
of even the humblest «f the laboring classes, «f sabsututing
decent and comfortable raiment for the few scanty and filthy
rags—the squalid exterior, which makes poverty notonjy irore
painful but atonce more humiliating and degrading to its vie
tim, and more disgustful to others than it ought to be, will signal _
ly contribute to e evate the condition of the poor in the eoc.t 1
scale, to raise iheir self esteem, and to increase the sympathy of
others for them—m a word, to make them feel themselves men,
entitled toa place among men n<5t pariahs and outcasts, whe^e
contact is contamination A people well clad and well housed will
be sure to provide themselves with ail the other comforts of hie,
and it is the diffusion of these comforts, and the growing ta¡>te for
them, among all classes of society in Europe, it is the desire
of riches, as it is commonly called, that is gradually putting an
end to the destiuctive and bioody game of war, and reserving
all the resources hitherto wasted by it for enterprises of indus-
try and commerce, prosecuted with the fiery spirit which once
vented itself in scenes of peril and carnage
But, sir, the result of all this is that very inequality of
wealth, that accumulation of vast masses of it in a few hands,
against winch we have heard so much said lately, as it it were
something mconsis ent with the liberties, the happiness, and
the moral and intellectual improvement of mankind Gigantic
fortunes are acquired by a few years of prorperous commeice,
mechanics and manufacturers uval and surpass the prmces oí
the earth in opulence and splendor The face of Kurope is

continent which the ■spirit of gam, with its usual concomitant-*,
industry and improvements, has invaded since the peace, at an
interval cf fifteen ieare, and been struck with the revolution
that is going on Ihere is a singularly beautiful though rathtr
barren tract of country between Liege and Spa, where, in 1&19,
my attention had been principally attracted by the striking fea
tures of a mountainous region, with here and there a rum of
the feudal past, and here and there a hovel of some poor hind,
the veiy haunt of the "Wild Boar of Ardennes,''* in the good
old times of the House of Burgundy I returned to it m 1835,
an 1 saw it covered with mills and lactones, begnmmed with
the smoke and «¡ooteffcieam engines, us romantic beauty de
