done by the State authority. There is no way in which this Department can interpose. But we will accept volunteers to go into the old regiments, and any excess after they are filled might be credited to the State in reduction of the draft.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

MADISON, WIS., August 11, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Orders and arrangements for the draft are received from Adjutant- General. I am proceeding to the enrollment, and will have it completed as soon as possible. It will be at least the 10th of September before drafting can actually commence. Volunteering in this State has been delayed by the harvest, but I think we shall fill our first call by the 15th. The spirit of volunteering to avoid draft is very active. I am constantly besieged by letters and dispatches from towns to know whether, if they furnish their quotas of volunteers for both calls, they will be exempt from draft. The plan of only receiving volunteers for old regiments after 15th instant will work badly if the localities are not to be credited with those volunteers; for all such volunteers being taken will, of course, increase the chances of draft in the localities from which they go. It is very desirable that we should be allowed to receive volunteers and organize regiments down to the time when the draft begins. If so, it will greatly accelerate the filling of our quota. If you prefer, fix a later day for this State beyond which volunteering cannot be received. Fix 10th of September, if possible, or 31st of August, if you cannot take so late a day. To cut off volunteering by the 15th of August will check the spirit among the loyal people of this State, who are thoroughly aroused to the determination to fill all by volunteering, if they can be allowed to do so by giving them time enough. Do not put a damper upon the present enthusiasm of our people. If the Government will allow this, I will assign enough of the volunteers to fill the old regiments from this State. I must have the authority asked for. To cut off volunteering in this State when it takes ten days to reach the most distant portions is unfair and unjust, and our people so feel it.

E. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Some proper person in the various localities should be designated to give passes to persons traveling on business before the time for drafting cod that all travel shall cease till then. Do not throw the burden upon me. I have no time to attend to it.

E. SALOMON,

Governor of Wisconsin.
