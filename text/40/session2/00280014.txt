SUPPLEMENT TO
records, books, papers, and other public property
now in your custody and charge.
Hon. Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War.
To which said order the said Stanton made
the following reply:
Wab Department,
Washington City, August 12, 1867.
"Sir: Your note of this date has been received,
informingme that by virtue of the powers vested in
you, as President, by the Constitution and laws of
the Uuited.States, I am suspended from office as Sec-
retary of War, and will cease to exercise any and all
functions pertaining to the same; and also directing
me at once to transfer to General Ulysses S. Grant,
who has this day been authorized and empowered to
act as Secretary of Var aclinterim, all records, books,
papers, and other public property now in my custody
and charge. Under a sense of public duty, I am
compelled to deny your right, under the Constitution
and laws of the United States, without the advice
and consent of the Senate, and without legal cause,
to suspend me from office as Secretary of War, or
the exercise of any or all functions pertaining to the
same, or without such advice and consent to compcl
me to transfer to any person the records, books,
papers, and public property in my custody as Sec-
retary. But inasmuch as the General commanding
the armies of tho United States has been appointed
ad interim, and'has notified me that ho has accepted
the appointment, I haveno al ternative but to submit,
under protest, to superior force."
To the Presidunt.
And this respondent, further answering,
says, that it is provided in and by the second
section of "an act to regulatethe tenure of
certain civil offices," that the President may
suspend an officer from the performance of
the duties of the office held by him, for certain
causes therein designated, until the next meet-
ing of the Senate and until the case shall bo
acted on by the Senate ; that this respondent,
as President of the United States, was advised
and ho verily believed and still believes, that
the executive power of removal from office
confided to him by the Constitution as afore-
said, includes the power of suspension from
office at the pleasure of the President and
this respondent, by the order aforesaid, did
suspend the said Stanton from office, not
until the next meeting of the Senate, or until
the Senate should have acted upon the case,
but by force of the power and authority vested
in liirn by the Constitution and laws of the
United States, indefinitely and at the pleasure
ot'the President, and the order, in form afore-
said, was made known to the Senate of the
United States, on the 12th day of December,
A. 1). 18G7, as will be more fully hereinafter
stated.
And this respondent, further answering,
says, that in and by the act of February It!,
17'J5, it was, among other things, provided and
enacted that, in case of vacancy in the office
of Secretary for the Department of War, it
shall be lawful for the President, in ease he
shall think it necessary, to authorize any per-
son to perform the duties of that office until a
successor he appointed or such vacancy filled,
but not exceeding the term of six months;
and this respondent, being advised and be-
lieving that such law was in full force and not
repealed, by an order dated August 12, 18G7,
did authorize and empower Ulysses S. Grant,
General of the armies of the United States,
to act as Secretary for the Department of War
ad interim, in the form in wliieh similar au-
thority had theretofore been given, not until
the next meeting of the Senate and until the
Senate should act on the case, but at the
pleasure of the President, subject only to the
limitation of six months in the said last-men-
tioned act contained; and a copy of the last-
named order was made known to the Senate
of the United States on the 12th day of Decem-
ber, A. U. 18G7, as willbehereinaftermore fully
stated; and in pursuance of the design and
intention aforesaid, if it should become neces-
sary, to submit the said questions to a judicial
determination, this respondent, at or near the
date of the last-mentioned order, did make
known such his purpose to obtain a judicial
decision of the said questions, or such of them
as might be necessary.
And this respondent, further answering, says,
that in further pursuance of his intention and
design, if' possible to .perform what he judged
to lie his imperative duty, to prevent the said
Stanton from longer holding the office of Sec-
retary for the Department of War, and at the
same time avoiding, if possible, any question
respecting the extent of the power of removal
from executive office confided to^ the Pres-
ident by the Constitution of the United States,
and any question respecting the construction
and effect of the first section of the said " act
regulating the tenure of certain civil offices,"
while he should not, by any act of his, abandon
and relinquish, either a power which he be-
lieved the Constitution had conferred on the
President of the United States^ to enable him
to perform the duties of his office, or a power
designedly left to him by the first section of
the act of Congress last aforesaid, this respond-
ent did, on the 12th day of December, 1867,
transmit to the Senate of the United States, a
message, a copy whereof is hereunto annexed
and marked B, wherein he made known the
orders aforesaid and the reasons which had
induced the same, so far as this respondent
then considered it material and necessary that
the same should be set forth, and reiterated
his views concerning the constitutional power
of removal vested in the President, and also
expressed his views concerning the construc-
tion of the said first section of the last-men-
tioned act, as respected the power of the Pres-
ident to remove the said Stanton from the said
office of Secretary for the Department of War,
well hoping that this respondent could thus
perform what he then believed, and still be-
lieves, to be his imperative duty in reference
to the said Stanton, without derogating from
the powers which this respondent believed
were confided to the President, by the Con-
stitution and laws, and without the necessity
of raising, judicially, any questions respecting
the same.
And this respondent, further answering, says,
that this hope not having been realized, the
President was compelled either to allow the
said Stanton to resume the said office and re-
main therein contrary to the settled convictions
of the President, formed as aforesaid, respect-
ing the powers confided to him and the duties
required of him by the Constitution of the
United States, and contrary to the opinion
formed as aforesaid, that the first section of the
last-mentioned act did not affect the case of
the said Stanton, and contrary to the fixed be-
lief of the President that he could no longer
advise with or trust or be responsible for the
said Stanton, in the said office of Secretary for
the Department of War, or else he was com-
pelled to lake such steps as might, in the judg-
ment of the President, be lawful and necessary
to raise, for a judicial decision, the questions
affecting the lawful right of the said Stanton
to resume the said office, or the power of the
said Stanton to persist in refusing to quit the
said office if he should persist in actually re-
fusing to quit the same; and to this end, and
to this end only, this respondent did, on the
21st day of February, 18G8, issue the order for
the removal of the said Stanton, in the said
first article mentioned and set forth, and the
order authorizing the said Lorenzo F. Thomas
to act as Secretary of War <id interim, in the
said second article set forth.
And this respondent, proceeding to answer
specifically each substantial allegation in the
said first article, says: He denies that the
said Stanton, on the 21st day of February,
18G8, was lawfully in possession of the said
office of Secretary for the Department of War.
lie denies that the said Stanton, on the day last
mentioned, was lawfully entitled to hold the
said office against the will of the President of
the United States. He denies that the said
order for the removal of the said Stanton was
unlawfully issued. He denies that (he said
order was issued with intent to violate the act
entitled '' An act to regulate the tenure of cer-
tain civil offices." lie denies that the said
order was a violation of the last-mentioned
act. He denies that the said order was a viola-
tion of the Constitution of the United States,
or of any law thereof, or of his oath of office.
He denies that the said order was issued with
an intent to violate the Constitution of the
United States or any law thereof, or this re-
spondent's oath of office; and he respectfully,
but earnestly, insists that not only was it
issued by him in the performance of what he
believed to be an imperative official duty, but in
the performance of what this honorable court
will consider was, in point of fact, an imper-
ative official duty. And he denies that any
and all substantive matters, in the said first
article contained, in manner and form as the
same are therein stated and set forth, do, by
law, constitute a high misdemeanor in office,
within the true intent and meaning of the Con-
stitution of the United States.
answeb 3j0 article ii.
And for answer to the second article this
respondent says that he admits he did issue
and deliver to said Lorenzo" Thomas the said
writing set forth in said second article, bearing
date at Washington, District of Columbia, Feb-
ruary 21, 18G8, addressed to Brevet Major Gen-
eral Lorenzo Thomas, Adjutant General United
States Army, Washington, District of Colum-
bia, and he further admits that the same was
so issued without the advice and consent of the
Senate of the United States, then in session,
but lie denies that he thereby violated the
Constitution of the United States, or any law
thereof, or that he did thereby intend to vio-
late the Constitution of the United States, or
the provisions of any act of Congress; and this
respondent refers to his answer to said first
article for a full statement of the purposes and
intentions with which said order was issued,
and adopts the same as part of his answer to
this article ; and he further denies that there
was then and there no vacancy in the said office
of Secretary for the Department of War, or
that he did then and there commit, or was
guilty of a high misdemeanor in office, and this
respondent maintains and will insist:
1. That at the date and delivery of said writ-
ing there was a vacancy existing in the office
of Secretary for the Department of War.
2. That, notwithstanding the Senate of the
United States was then in session, it was law-
ful and according to long and well established
usage to empower and authorize the said
Thomas to act as Secretary of War ad interim.
3. That, if the said act regulating the tenure
of civil offices be held to be a valid law, no
provision of the same was violated by the issu-
ing of said order or by the designation of said
Thomas to act as Secretary of War ad interim.
ANSWER TO ARTICLE III.
And for answer to said third article this
respondent says that he abides by his answer
to said first and second articles, in so far as
the same are responsive to the allegations con-
tained in the said third article, and, without
here again repeating the same answer, prays
the same be taken as an answer to this third
article as fully as if here again set out at
length ; and as to the new allegation contained
in said third article, that this respondent did
appoint the said Thomas to be Secretary for
the Department of War ad interim, this re-
spondent denies that he gave any other au-
thority to said Thomas than such as appears
in said written authority set out in said article,
by which lie authorized and empowered said
Thomas to act as Secretary for the Department
of War ad interim ■ and ho denies that the
same amounts to an appointment and insists
that it is only a designation of an officer of
that Department to act temporalily as Secre-
tary for the Department of War ad interim
until an appointment should be made. But,
whether the said written authority amounts to
an appointment or to a temporary authority
or designation, this respondent denies that i:i
any sense he did thereby intend to violate the
Constitution of the United States, or that he
thereby intended to give the said order the
character or effect of an appointment in the
constitutional or legal sense of that term. Ho
further denies that there was no vacancy in said
office of Secretary for the Department of War
existing at the date of said written authority.
