Major-General ROSECRANS:

John Kelly is hereby authorized to raise a company of mounted men to serve for twelve months, which you will have mustered into service when organized upon the conditions which have this day been forwarded by mail. Is there anything that I can do in your rear that will promote the interests of the Army of the Cumberland? If so, say what it is. The holding of your recent position is looked upon as a great victory and the nation will appreciate.

Is there any service that General Gillem or myself can render you by being there in person?

We are making all possible progress with the Northwest railroad. We now realize its value to your army in the present crisis more than ever.
