GENERAL: Deserter from Tenth Florida, Finegan's brigade, came in at 9 o'clock last evening. Has no knowledge of position or movement of troops except in his own division (Mahone's); that Mahone's division is in the same position it has occupied for the past two weeks, excepting Wright's brigade, which moved day before yesterday. Informant thinks it went to the north side of the Appomattox, but his information is founded on rumor. Cannot give any information of other divisions.
