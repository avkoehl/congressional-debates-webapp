HEADQUARTERS POST,Salina, Kans., October 26, 1864.

Lieutenant A. HELLIWELL,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: A number of Kaw Indians have just come in from a hunting expedition and report the Cheyenne and Kiowa Indians to be in large force forty miles from here up the Salina River. They also state that they had an engagement with them and were repulsed with the loss of two men. They propose going back and fighting, provided there are rations issued sufficient to last them and their families during their absence and a sufficient force sent them to insure safety. They also captured a Government horse. Said horse has been with me to be turned over to Government.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

Your obedient servant,

JACOB VAN ANTWERP,

First Lieutenant, Eleventh Kansas Volunteer Cavalry, Commanding Post.
