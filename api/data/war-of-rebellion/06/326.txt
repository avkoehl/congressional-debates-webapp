for cavalry, and equipments, and a few hundred bags of buck-shot. If General Trapier should decline the command here, and your excellency would prefer to have the military department under the command of an officer appointed by yourself rather than the governor of Florida, then I respectfully recommend Colonel Richard F. Floys, a citizen of this State, a native of Georgia, and now in command at Apalachicola by my appointment. He is about fifty years old; a soldier and a gentleman of strict sobriety and integrity; a good disciplinarian, and a gentleman of excellent sense and unquestionable courage.

Respectfully,

JOHN MILTON.

STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA,

Headquarters, November 19, 1861.

General LEE,

Commanding:

SIR: As you have recently arrived to take command, I think, perhaps, it may be useful to you to have a general and authentic statement of the forces now in actual service for Georgetown to hardeeville. I therefore inclose the within statement, that you may know what troops you can use for any immediate emergency.

I am not yet prepared to state exactly what regiments can be raised immediately or mustered in. I suppose you will have about 2,500 or the arms recently arrived to put in their hands and I think I can have 1,000; that is, in all 3,500. If the regiments are mustered in and get those arms, which no doubt will be their case, it will give about 20,000 men, who can be relied on, with arms. As to what you can get in an emergency from General Lawton and General Anderson, I can know nothing certain.

With very great respect, your obedient servant,

F. W. PICKENS.

[Inclosure.]
