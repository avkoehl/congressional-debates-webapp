THOS. J. McKEAN,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTH KANSAS,Paola, Kans., May 25, 1864.

Colonel C. W. BLAIR,

Commanding 1st Brigadier, Dist. of South Kans., Fort Scott, Kans.:

COLONEL: By direction of the general commanding the district, I inclose herewith copies of several communications from the major-general commanding the department, in reference to an escort for refugee Indians now at Humboldt. You will perceive that it is expected that the necessary escort will be furnished from the troops on our southern border as far as Fort Gibson, unless relieved before reaching that post by troops sent from there. General Curtis desires that the Indians be indulged, if practicable, in the matter of sending a "gun on wheels." If possible a howitzer will be sent with the escort. All the information upon the subject that has reached these headquarters is contained in the telegrams alluded to. You will make arrangements for carrying out the intention of General Curtis in the matter by sending a proper escort from your brigade, under command of a good officer. Lieutenant-Colonel Plumb had best not be detached at present, as it might interfere with the progress of the defenses at Humboldt. You will perceive that transportation and subsistence for themselves is all that the escort will be obliged to take.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Captain J. W. PARMETAR,

Twelfth Kansas Infantry, Commanding Post, Fort Larned, Kans.:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor of acknowledging the receipt of your communications in regard to the troubles with the Indians in your vicinity. The general commanding the district directs me to say that a company of cavalry has been sent from Fort Riley to re-enforce your command, which will probably arrive at your post before you receive this communication. Your communications, together with the report of Lieutenant George S. Eayre, have been forwarded to department headquarters, for the information of the major-general commanding.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. S. HAMPTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
