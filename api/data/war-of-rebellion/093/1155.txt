matter of the dispatch. Will learn from him how much sick he has and how many contrabands that cannot march with him. I told him his sick might go to Chattanooga on the two trains going down:

TULLAHOMA, November 29, 1864-8.10 p.m.

Major General L. H. ROUSSEAU:

Dispatch received. Shall I march as soon as the supply train moves off? Shall I take the block-house and bridge garrisons with me as I march? What disposition will be made of the sick in hospital here and the hundreds of poor contrabands? Shall I take in the garrisons between this and Elk River?

R. H. MILROY,

Major-General.

L. H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864-10.30 p.m.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Murfreesborough:

Your dispatch of 8.45 p.m. is received. Say to General Milroy that his sick can be sent to Chattanooga and that his contrabands can go cross Elk River and go to Cowan, where General Steedman will be with sufficient force to protect them. The garrison between Elk River bridge and Tullahoma will be collected together and taken to Murfreesborough with General Milroy's troops. He will also draw the troops stationed in block-houses, &amp;c., between Tullahoma and Murfreesborough on his way back.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

MURFREESBOROUGH, November 29, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

What shall I do with the garrisons on the road between this and Tullahoma? Elk River is very strong, and with plenty of supplies and ammunition cannot be taken by cavalry. I should be very glad to be allowed to keep the garrison there, giving it abundance of supplies and ammunition, the bridge and block-houses being worth the risk. I have time yet to withdraw that garrison, except ten men to guard the bridge until the trains go over, and then go on the trains, and let it march to this place with General Milroy.

LOVELL H. ROUSSEAU,

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, November 29, 1864.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Murfreesborough:

The garrison at Elk River bridge can remain, as you desire; they will report to Major-General Steedman, at Cowan, who will afford assistance if necessary. I have directed that 500 cattle now at Tullahoma be driven to Elk River bridge, to be turned over to the garrison at that place. A hospital train will be at Murfreesborough at an early hour in the morning. I wish you to have the train loaded immediately upon its arrival and returned to Nashville.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
