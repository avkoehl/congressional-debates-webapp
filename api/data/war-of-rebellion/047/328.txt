Another heavy bombardement of Sumter yesterday afternoon and to-day. Damage to walls considerable, but fort shall be held to last extremity. Intercepted letters of enemy indicate determination to run past forts with iron-clads. Have made my preparations accordingly.

WAR DEPT., ADJT. AND INSP. GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Richmond, September 1, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD, Charleston, S. C.:

GENERAL: The President having received notice of the bursting of two of the heavy rifled guns at your batteries, within a few days past, and of the large amount of ammunition daily expended, has requested me to suggest, for your consideration, whether the firing the heavy guns at too great elevation, and with too heavy charges, may not tend to render the guns and carriages unserviceable prior to the time when they may be most required for use with the ordinary service charge; and also whether ammunition may not be economized to some extent without injury to the defense of Charleston.
