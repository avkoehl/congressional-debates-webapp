nient If the territory now forcibly and exclusively
occupied by British power on our northeastern
frontier was a constituent part of one of the States
of this Union, let an end be put to that assump-
tion ind let the laws of Maine and this Union oe
made to extend over the entire territory, and to its
utmost limits
One gentleman on this floor, I regret to hear,
apologized for the British m their recent violation
of our sovereignty, m catting out in the night time,
with an armed force, from the American shoie, the
steamer Caroline, throwing her over the falls,
and slaughtering our defenceless citizens He
seems to think the British commander may not bo
to blame
Mr HAMER    Does the gentleman refer to me'
Mr CILLEY    I do
Mr H4.MERdisclaimed having made the state-
ment on his own authority, or as having expressed
his own belief He had merely re'ered to what
had b«en read by the gentleman from Buffalo,
(Mr Filmore) and what he had advanced was
bast d on the statements then made
Mr CILLEY resumed I did not understand
the gentleman as expressing fully his own belief,
but the tenor of his remarks were calculated to
carry the conviction to my mind, that it was lci-
sonable to conclude that this omrage ft is wholly
unauthorized by the commander of the British
tones at Chippewa, and that ihe British «okliery
h,ul committed the wrong of their own motion
Now, sir, I have no douot that the outrage will be
disavowed by the commander and Government
State policy may dictate this, especially when they
learn the feelins it jusfl} excites, but I must be
permitted to express my own belief that the out-
rage w as commuted by the orders, and with the
countenance ot the British authorities then m com-
mand The circumstances of the case all look
that way It was in keeping with the domineering
spirit of British authority They had seen the boat
ply between the American side and -Navy Island,
where are binded together what they please to
term pirates, traitors, and rebels, and robbers
They determined to take her anil destroy her, utter-
ly regardles  of our rights and sovereignty in so
doing What, sir, has been the conduct ot the
British authorities on another, though more distant
portion of our frontier' Had they not seized Ame-
rican ciu/ens on our own terntoiy, earned thtm
off, and cast ihem into prison, where even 01 e so
seized is held in durance to this hour' It is eisy
here for gentlemen to blame the hasty zeal of those
of out en/tus who live upon the borders, but do
they know what those men have to suffer from the
violence of British authority' I admit (hit citizens
there, as well as elsewhere, under the influence rf
excíteme it sometimes act in a hasty an 1 unguard-
ed manner, and that it becomes us, as good
citizens, to maintain the neutrality of our Go-
vernment If the existing laws are insuffi-
cient for the purpose, let stronger be enact-
e I But it is e\ idem, from all we have heaid
fir v ears past that a great contest is going on m
the British provinces to the north of us, and that
the crisis is neai at hand The people ot the Ca-
ñadas are unfavorable to the longer continuance ot
Br tish dominion over them They are about de-
c eeing, if they have not already done it, as oui
t ithe s did more than half a century ago, that Bn-
t sh oppression and usurpation shall cease among
the n, and that they will hereafter choose their own
men to make and administer their own laws, and
l> control their own money These were feelings
in which American patriots were ever ready to
sympathize, and no powei on earth should ever
compel him to suppress the feelings of his heart m
favor of those who, capable of self government,
ind risking all minor things, were manfully con-
tending for the liberty to establish it Noi do I
believe that, by our citizens expressing such senti-
ments, H'e shall provoke a wai with Great Britain,
or any other foreign power, and least of all can
we avoid War by s ibrmttin,; to encioachmeuts,

MR   CALHOUN'S RESOLUTIONS
DEBATE IN THE SENATE,
JiNiMKr 6, 1838
Tie  question  being on Mr   Morris's amend
mint to the third lesolution, declaring the freedom
ot speech and the  pi ess on all subjects indisputa-
ble, and under the supervision only of the Stite m
which such freedom is exeicised—
Mi D WIS «aid that he had several times briefly
addiessed the Senate upon this subject, which ioi
two veais or more had been gieatly agitated,more
so, jirobibly, than w as useful As long ago as
that, an eiiort was made to suppress petitions upon
the subjcci of abolition in this body, and from
thence till now ihe matter had received much at-
t ntion at times, though both here and in the other
House much i egret had been expressed that it was
agitated at all
At the first session of the last Congress, after a
long, animated, denunciatory debate, carried on
chiefly by the members from the South, the Senate
arrived at certain results m regard to abolition pe-
titions, in which he (Mr D ) did not concui, but
a very great majority did It was propel to
recurro the slale ol things then, and to call to mind
the sentiments of that day The leading argument
in that debate was, that tne agitation ol the ques-
tion wis a source oí great dangei, pregnant with
imnous consequences to the country, causing sen
ons obstruction to the action of Congress, and
great uneasiness out of doors And it was most
urgently insisted that it was one of ihose delicate
topics w hich it was not sale to discuss, which, in
truth, we had no right to discuss, either as regard-
el ihe States interested, oi the District of Columbia
or the Teiritones.
Such, sir being the avowed sentiments of a
majouiy of ihe Senate, they proceeded to give to
them sanction and practical effect, and they d d
suppress debate, and close the doors against peli-
t ons, for, thuujh they resolved to leceive them,
yet ihey immediately afterwards adopted the prac-
tice whieh has ever since been in force, as the
journal willpiove A Senator, foi example, offers
a petition, another objects to the reception, the one
holding the petition then moves for its reception,
the olhei immediately moves to lav this motion on
the table which motion is not debaleable, but is
carried bv t large majonty The consequence
is, that the one presenting the petition is denied the
right to lay it before the Senate, as the Senate re-
fused to íeceive it The Senator from South Ca-
rolina (Mr Cilhoun) was in the lead* of these
measure^, and is it not true that he was sustained
by an overwhelming majority'
Mi Cilhols said the course which he marked
oui was not followed at all
Mr Divis I did not mean to say that the detail
of the Senator's proposal  was adopted, but that
the Senate sustained ihe chief purpose he aimed at
Mr Caí hoiin I was in the minority in every
v te on this subject I wished to meet the petitions,
and to refuse th<> admission of them I wished to
take higher and stronger ground I was not averse
to agitation
Mr Divis I did not allege that the Senator
was averse to agitation, but that it was geneially
deprecated, and that his proposed measures looked
to that end, as the journal most fully proves If
the Senator had not interrupted me, he would have
had no occasion to complain, or to correct me, for
I vv as about m notice whit I am aware of, that th<
propo ed eO'irse of the member was to meet the
petitioners at the door, shut it in their faces, turn
Senate.
them down staiK*, and bid them begone, and ihat
he urged the Senate to sustain that view of the
matter In that I know there was a failure, but
in his general object, though attained by different
means, he did fully succeed. He and his friends
did erect a barrier as high as he could deStre—a
barrier insurmountable to the petitioners, and as
effectual to stop agitation and debate m this cham-
ber, and the presentation of petitions, as it could be,
short of penal liabilities Discussion died with
this ai binary rule, because the Senate yielded obe-
dience to it If any thing of much importance had
since been sard, it had escaped my observotion I
therefore íepeat that the object of the Senator had
been attained, the petitioneis have been driven
away without a hearing, no answer to their prayer
has been made, no, not so much as to say they
weie in error What, I would ailt, could the Sen-
ator do beyond this, if the Senate yielded itself to
his will?
The Senator lrom Virginia (Mr Rives) said
yesieiday, that the States could take care of them-
seles, d the channel through this Government was
closed uji, f( r he feared nothing from Ihe Aboli-
tionists in then own tetntoiy Did not the Senate
close ivp this channel most effectually' Is it not
choked to the lop, so that nothing can reach the
Senate' What higher or strongei barrier can be
made? There is but one that can be more effec-
tual, and that is, to make a law of Congress, con-
sisting of pains and penalties Make it felony,
punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary
lor any one to petition for the abolition of slavery
in this Distuct If there be no right to petition,
and the petitioners are violators of the Constitution,
disturbers of the public peace, criminal agttatois,
threatening the safely of the Unien, then such
a law will be both constitutional and expedi-
ent Let it be brought forward, for it will test the
principles advocated, and put members to vote
upon a responsibility beyond a mere expression of
opinion Send such offenders a?amst the public
peace and public justice to the judicial tribunals, it
such is the sense of Congress, to receive the reward
of their merjts This would bear the stamp of con-
sistency If the doctrines winch tend to such re-
sells are sound, then let them go forth m a form
that shall be understood and felt Let those who
demand relief take the remedy learlessly into their
hands, and they will soon learn, the views of the
public on thia right of petition This would be
more manly than to agitate the public with threats.
It would fence the people out from the Capitol, and
separate them jrom their own Government It would
consign ofltnders to infamy for presumptuously
danng to -ipptoach these halls to make an liurable
lequest The Senator has not propose I to go this
length, and although he was quite right in saying
he was m a minority, yet it is obvious that he ef-
fected his mam object Petitions continue to come
heie, but to what end' Neither to be lead, heard,
nor received Not oue has since come to the pos-
session ol the Senate, so as to be in order for its
action, nor, under existing practice, could one come
to its possession
I     In this stdte of things, why are we appealed to
I for new measjres, which can do no more than ac-
complish  Ihe  same thing, if   they do as much'
I Why does the Senator from Carolina, when so so-
licitous to exclude trom these halls the petititions—
when he has steadtastly maintained that Congress
has no light to debate or act on the subject—.why
does he voluntarily introduce  it heie'   A subject
, too delicate to asitate oi e « hich it is said we ought
not to discus    and have no light to consider' Why,
j then, is discussion invited' Why is examination
provoked?    Whv is controversy challenged?
For myself, said Mi D I have been dis-
posed to respect the avowed feelings of southern
Senators, and as iliev seemed to deprecate discussion
as a cilannty, I have avoided it, leaving it m the
handsofthe mover and those interesteu I had no pur-
pose ol changing my course till that Senator,yester«
day, threw down the glove, and challenged discus-
sion, m terms which almost made it dishonorable
to forbear This ehallenge, and this alone, has ia«
duced me to rise, «oi I had resolved that fee Sena-
loi should be left free to act upon the majority,
