that the exhibit cannot be furnished from this office. I would add, however, that the information must already be in the office of your adjutant-general, since by paragraph 15 of the Revised Mustering Regulations copies of the muster-in rolls are directed to be furnished him. In addition I will state that no changes have been made by this Department in the exhibit from this office of May 19, save to credit your State with 152 men of the First Cavalry, and the 82 men of the Hospital Guard, making a total of 234 men.

On the 30th of November I had the honor to inform you that 9,150 men had been mustered into service. Deducting therefrom 6,663 (strength of regiments per statement of May 19, exclusive of recruits and nine-months" men), there appeared a gain of 2,487, and deducting the 2,131 recruits, as per that statement, a net gain of 356 three-years" men. Since that date additional musters have been made, and the account, therefore, stands at the date of December 31 as follows, viz:

Exhibit of May 19:

Three-years" regiments .................................. 6,663

Three-years" recruits ................................... 2,131

Two regiments nine-months" (2,059) - equivalent, when re-

duces to the three-years" standard, to .................. 515

(Four nine-months" equals one three-years".)

Letter of November 5: First Cavalry and Hospital Guard .. 234

Letter of January 22:

May 19 to September 30, 1863 ............................ 799

October 1 to December 31, 1863 .......................... 1, 183

------

Total credits to December 31 ............................11,525

In reply to that portion of Your Excellency's letter in reference to the three-months" men, I have to state that as yet no State has been credited with that class of troops. Can you conveniently cause me to be furnished from your State records with an exhibit, by regiments, of the number of such troops furnished by the State? If so, it will be useful for the purpose of comparison with the returns here filed.

I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,
