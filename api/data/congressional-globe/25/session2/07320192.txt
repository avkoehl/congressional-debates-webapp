concerned, and it would be not less rational to
suppose, that such a power on the part of indivi-
duals, would be consistent with a uniform and sta-
ble currency, than to suppose the receiving and
treating bank notes as a substitute for money by
the Government Would be The only chet k or
remedy is to restrict them to their proper sphere—to
circulate m common with bills of exchange or other
private and local paper, for the convenience of bu-
siness and trade. So far from such a course opera-
ting injuriously on th« people, or from being liable
to the charge of forming one currency for the peo-
ple and another for the Government, as has been
so often and with such effect repeated—it * the
very reverse. Government by refusing to receive
bank notes, as it is bound to do, would in fact fur-
nish a choice to the peoplei to take either money
notes at their pleasure The demand of the Go
Vernment will always keep a plentiful supply of
the former m the country, so as to afford the peo-
ple a Choice, while the the opposite would expel the
money, and leave ho option to them but to take
Bank notes or worse, as at present
I have now shown how it is proposed to fonn
the league of banks, and have presented the con-
stitutional impediments that stand in the way
These are numerous and strong, so much  o, that
they ought to be irresistible with all, except the
latitudinous in construction, bin I cannot expect
they will produce their full effect I know too
well the force of long entertained impiessions,
however erroneous, tb be sanguine—how strongly
the mind rebels against the expulsion of the old
and fee admission ef new opinion  Yet, in this
Case, where we clearly see how gradually and
Silently efrür crept íh Under the disguise Of words
applied to new and totally different ideas, without
exciting notice or alarrh, and when we have expe
fienced such deep disasters in consequence of patt-
ing from the plain intent and meaning of the Con-
stitution, I cannot but hope that all u ho believe
that the success of the Government depends on a
rigid adherence to the Constitution, will la) aside
all previous impressions, taken up without reflec-
tion, and give to the objections their due weight
I come now to the next point, to show how this
league is to be revived or stimulated into life Till
this can be done, the substitute, should it become
a law, would be a dead letter The selection is to
be mads from specie paying banks None hut
such can receive the public deposites, or hive their
notes received in the dues of the Government
There are none such now The whole banking
system lies inanimate, and must be vivified before
it can be reunited with the Government Ho one
is bold enough to propose an union with this life-
less mass How then is the vital spark to be re-
vivad? how the breath of life, the Promethean fire,
to be breathed into the system anew, is the que 
üon?   This is the task
The mover tells us that it must be the work of
the Government, He says that it is bound to aid
the banks to resume payments, and for that pur-
pose ought to hold out to them some adequate in-
ducement He tells us that they have been long
preparing, and had made great effort , but can go
no farther, have rolled the round, huge rock almost
to the summit, but unless the Government put forth
its giant arm, and give the last push, it will recoil
and rush down the steep to the bottom, and all past
labor be lost Now, what is this adequate in-
ducement'' "What this powerful stimulus, which it
is proposed the Government should apply, in order
to enable the banks to accomplsh this herculean
task?   The substitute shall answer
It prosposes to fix the 1st of July next for the
p iod of resumption, and, as the inducement to re-
sume, it proposes to select twent}-five of the most
respectable and solid, out of the resuming banks, to
be the depositories of the public monejs, and the
fiscal agent of the Government, as has been already
stated. It also proposes, and this is the stimulus,—
the essence of the whole,—to make the notes of
such banks as may resume on or before that day,
exclusively receivable in the public dues Here is
a oiifá pro quo; something proposed to be done, for
which something is to be given We tell the banks
plainly, if you resume, we, on our part, stipulate to
jhtóe twenty-five of you our fiscal agents and de-
positories of the revenue, and we further stipulate,
that those who resume by the time fixed, shall have
the exclusive privilege,/   ever of having their notes
receivable in the dues of the Government, in com-
mon with gold and silver If the banks perform
their part, we shall be bound in honot and good
faith to perform ours It would be a complete con-
tract, as obligatory as if signed, sealed, and deliver-
ed    Such is the inducement
The next question i% will it be adequate? Yes,
abundantly adequate The battery is stiong
enough to awaken the dead to hie, the considera-
tion sufficient to remunerate the banks for what-
ever sacrifice they may be compelled to make, in
order to resume payment It is difficult to estimate
the value of these high priviliges, or prerogatives,
as I might justly call thfm They arc worth mil-
lions If jou were to inter into a surilar contiact
with an individual, 1 doubt not that he could sell
out in open maiket loi at least thut) , ioity, oi fifty
millions of dollars I do then the mover the jus
tice to sa), that hio means are ample to eilect what
he proposes As difficult as is ihe w ork of resump-
tion—and difficult it v ill turn out to be when tried
—the inducement will pwne all sufficient But the
, resumption, however desirable, may be purchased
too dcai 1), and such would prove to be the case,
should the pn jeet sneceed Not only is the oiler
too great, but the mode of effecting it is highly ob-
jtctionable Its operation would prove not less
disastrous than the baigani has been shown to be
unconstitutional, which I shall now proceed to
establish
Thi oflti will ha\e a double effect It Will act
as i powerful stimulus to resumption, but will act
at the same time with equal loice to excite a strug-
gle among the banks, not onlv to resume them-
selves, but to prevent othtr*! frum resuming The
íeason is clear The advantage to etch will in-
crease, as the number of the íesuming banks de-
ceases, and oi coursi, the gieat point of contest
among die strong Will b« to restrict the proffered
pn/t to the smallest number The closer the mo-
nopoly the gieater the profits In this struggle, a
combination of % few powerful and wealth v banks,
the most respectable and solid as designated in ihe
substitute, will overthrow and tiample down the
residue Their fall -will spread desolation over Ihe
land Whatever may be thi fate of other., in this
desperné contest, there is one in relation to which
no doubt can be entertained 1 refer to the United
States Bank of Pennsylvania, a long name and a
misnomer, and which, for the sake of brevity, but
with no personal disrespect to the distinguished in-
dividual at its head, I shall call Mr Biddle'sbank
That, at least, will be one of the winners—one of
the twent} five to whom the pn/e will be assigned
Its vast resources, its wealth and influential con-
nections, both at home and abioad, the skill and
ability of the officer at its head, and, what is less
honorable, the great resource it holds in the notes
of the late United States Bank, of which more than
six millions have been put into circulation, in vio-
lation, to say the least, of a trust, constituting more
than five sixths of all its circulation, and whi<h it
is not bound to pay—with the still greater amount
on hand making in the whole more than twenty-
six millions, and which may be used in the same
way, if not prevented—would place it beyond all
doubt among the victors
He starts without proper weights, and will
lead the way from the first Who the others may
be is uncertain, tins will depend mainly upon his
good will and pleasure It may be put down as
certain, whoever fhey may be, that they will be
powerful and influential, and not unfavorable to
his interest or aggrandizement But the mischiev-
ous effect will not be limited to this death-like strug-
gle, in which so many must fall and be crushed
that might otherwise weather the storm The
forced resumption, for such it will be in effect,
would be followed b) wide spread desolation It
is easy to sink to suspension, but hard to return to
resumption Under the most favorable circum-
stances, and when conducted most leisurely and
cautiously, the pressure must be severe, but, if
coerced or precipitated by bankrupt laws or temp-
tations such as this, it will be ruinous To make
it safe and easy must be the work of tune.   Go-
vernment can do but little. The disease originates
m excessive indebtedness, and the only remedy is
payment or reduction of debts. It is estimated
that when the banks suspended payments, the com-
munity was indebted to them the enormous sum of
$475,000,000. To reduce this within the proper
limits, is not the work of a few days,-and can be but
little aided by us. The industry, and the vas>t re-
sources, of the country,with time, are the only rem-
edies to be relied on for the reduction, and to these,
with the State Legislatures and the public opinion,
the resumpuon must be left To understand the
subject fully, we must look a little more into the
real cause of the difficulty.
This enormous debt was incurred in prosperous
times. The abundant mean  of the banks from
the surplus revenue, and a combination of other
causes, induced them to discount freely. This in-
creased the circulation, and, with its increase, its
value depreciated, and prices rose proportionally.
With this rise, enterprise and speculation seized the
whole community, and every one expected to make
a fortune at once, and this in turn gave a new im-
pulse to discounts and circulation, till the swelling
tide bursted its barriers and deluged the land Then
began the opposite process of absorbing the excess.
It it had been possible to return it back to the banks,
the s-ources from which it flowed, through its debt-
ors, the speculating, enterprising, and business por-
tion of the community, the mischief would have
been, in a great measure, avoided. But circulation
had flowed off into other reservoirs, those of the
moneyed men and bankers, who hoard when prices
are high, and buy when they are low The por-
tion thus drawn off and held in deposite, either in
banks or the chests of individuals, was as effectual-
ly lost, as far as the debtors of the banks were con-
cerned, as if it had been burnt The means of
paj ment were thus diminished, prices fell in propor-
tion, and the pressure mcieased as they fell.
Though the amount in cuculation be greatly redu-
ced, yet the banks are afraid to discount, lest, on
resumption, the hoarded mass of deposites held
by individuals or other banks, should be let
loose, and, in addition to what might be put
into circulation should discounts be made, would
cause another inundation to be followed by another
suspension How is this difficulty to be safely
surmounted, but by unlocking the hoarded means?
And how is this to be done, without deciding the
currency question? This is the fiist and necessary
step That done, all will be able to calculate, and
determine what to do The period of inaction and
uncertainty -would cease, and that of business re-
vive funds that are now locked up, would be
biought again into operation, and the channels of
circulation be replenished in the only mode that
can be done with safety Thus thinking, I am now
and have been from the fir  t in favor of an early
decision, and averse to all coercion, or holding out
temptation to resume leaving the disease to the
gradual and safe operation of time, with as little
tampering as possible In the mean time, I hold
it to be unwi«e to cease discounting, and to adopt
an indiscriminate system of curtailment Its effects
are ruinous to the business of the country, and cal-
culated to retard, rather than to accelerate a resump-
tion The true system, I would say, would be to
discount with business paper as freely as usual, and
curtail gradually on permanent debts The for-
mer would revive business, and would increase the
debts to the banks le s than it would increase the
ability of the community to pay them.
Having now shown how this league, or combi-
nation of banks, is to be formed and revived, with
the difficulties in the "w ay, it remains to determine
what will be the true character and nature of the
combination when formed It will consist of State
banks retaining, their original powers, that of dis-
counting and all, without being in the slightest de-
gree impaired To these the substitute proposes to
add important additions to receive their notes as
gold and silver m the public dues, and to give
them the use of the public deposites, and to or-
ganize and blend the whole into one, as the fiscal
agent of the Government, to be placed under the
immediate supervision and control of the Secreta-
ry of the Treasury. Now what does all this amount
to?   Shall I name the woj-d—bg n.Qt startled. A,
