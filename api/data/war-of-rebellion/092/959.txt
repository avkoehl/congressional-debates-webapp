General S. COOPER:

If enemy take Savannah it is evident that by using the river as a base he may cut the Augusta railroad at many points, and Charleston would then become soon after untenable. I have ordered river obstructed at many points.

General.

CHARLESTON, December 15, 1864.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Lieutenant-General Hardee has nothing new to report to-day. There are 5,000 prisoners at Thomasville, GA., that should be removed to Andersonville. Will you please give the necessary orders.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

General Hardee reports at Savannah, on 9th, his effectives of all arms at about 10,000. General Jones reports from Pocotaligo, on 12th, his effectives of all arms at about 5,500. There is no report from General Wheeler, but his forces must be about 3,000.

CHARLESTON, December 15, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

General Beauregard has ordered rations for 15,000 men for sixty days to be collected in Charleston. Am informed depot commissary has on had 500,000 pounds of sugar; large portion ordered to Richmond. In present deficiency of meat rations cannot the sugar be detained here for General Hardee?

H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CHARLESTON, December 15, 1864.

(Received 12 p. m.)

General S. COOPER:

My instructions to Lieutenant-General Hardee are based on the fact that, having no army of relief to look to, it is more important, after proper resistance, to save our troops and material than to sacrifice all by too protracted defense. I desire being informed if these instructions are approved by the War Department, and are applicable to Charleston as well as Savannah.

G. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
