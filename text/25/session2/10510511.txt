Territory of Iowa.—Mr. Shepard.
H. of Reps.
then we will find it inch pensable to have a United States Bank
owned by mdiv du lis or a Treasury bank owned by the hi ¡led
States, and gov erned at the will of the Executive
Being opposed to both these, and thmking the coin try mu^t
have credit  in so lie Jhape, I Ouppoit fetate banks as the only
means of pie vening the establish men of some one of the others
I think them hah uncois ltuuonal, and the lieaaUiy bank
infinitely the mo«i dangeious
We might as well at once put the whole rnontyo of the
Governmental the dispj itunufthe Executne as lo uassthis

It is true we wete not eitnei Whig^, Tones, or Democrats by
inneritance, but there is much m blood, much m education
Early ldascns from mothers are apt to have an inflt ence upon
us through life What the fathersays when he first sends his
boy to school is hardly ever forgotten
When that law was passed, and for yeaia aftei ward, the first
morning the son was to start for school, he was sure to receive
the fathers advice, m emphatic terms, caculated to make a
lasting impression, m language like the fallowing My son,
you aie now going to school, you must rendei a willing obedi

Cm'dien were taught from infancy the doctnne of equality,
tnat no distinction ought to exist, except that which was pro-

\nd as to a circula ing medí urn, this old act contains a yolume
of n « action for me At that day, the medium of our ex
cha j «i wp skins and pel i y oi furb Tl ey were the currency
m winch the people were obliged to transact their business, and
my labor when voting fer that law, thought it just that our
ofiicei 1 rom the Governor to the constable should be paid m
the sime kind of cutiency which the people were compelled
to u«e in their dealings with eaeh olhei, and so think I now aa to

the m     i ty of my constituents from my youth to this day
My \ shi^to carry into effect their will If I had fortitude
enough to venture irtoan unknown world I would rather do
so nou 0.1U upon tm^ spot than krowmg y to eive avote upon
a sueject so lrnpe i tan , which would disappoint the wishes of the
companions of my yoj h, the associates of my maturei yiars,
and those who have evei sustained me against all attacks, at

WnatI believe to be their will corresponds with my own
judgment on this ¡subject anj howevei much 1 may and do
