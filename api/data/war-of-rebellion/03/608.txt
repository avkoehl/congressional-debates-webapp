BENTONVILLE, ARK., July 15, 1861.

Major-General PRICE, Commanding Missouri Troops:

GENERAL: I find it impossible to occupy any point near the State line, owing to the scarcity of water and supplies; consequently, I will remain in this neighborhood until I learn more of the movements of the enemy. If I could be informed, at short notice, of the advance of the enemy from Neosho towards you, we could reach you in time to support you, in the event of your checking him on Buffal Creek. A day or two will develop his plans, and I may return to my former camp or one still nigher to you. If there were supplies to be had, I would at once occupy Pineville. As soon as I hear from you and the enemy, I intend making an examination of the road as far as Cassville in person, so as to be able, if necessary, to take a position near that point.

Please keep me well informed of the movements of the enemy, and oblige your obedient servant,

BEN. McCULLOCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
