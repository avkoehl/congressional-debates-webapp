Mr LINN remarked that m the Senator fiom 11 liana [Mr
Pmitb] had the  floor for to day upon the resolution of the
60MGftES§i0KAL GlOBÉ.
Senator from Kentucky he wonld suggest that the resolution
now before the Senate be passed over informally until to
morrow
Mr MERRICK hoped that the suggestion would not he ac
qmesced m, as the resolution would not cause much debate,
and as it could be easily disposed of
Mr LTJSN a^suied the Senator that there was likely to arise
considerable débale upon thp subject, and on his motion the
Senate proceeded to the orders of the day
The orders of the day bi ought up Mi Clay's retrenchment
and reform resolutions, as the unfinished business of yesterday,
Mr Smith of Indiana being entitled to the floor
Mr SMITH observed that m proceeding to address the Se
nate he could not allege as other Senators frequently did, that
he had1 only a word to say "for he had many and would proba
bly have to proceed at ccnsidpi able length,and yet not be able to
present to the Senate all he wished But he did not expect to
cover the whole ground which such a wide field of argument
as the^e resolutiors o, ened up That, however was no reason
why he should either be wholly silent, or limit himself to a
brief and imperfect analysis of Mich branches of the subject
as he considered most important In dwelling on these sub
jects he would endeavor to lo«e as little time as posible in un
meaning language, for he had always made it his practice to
abide by the golden rule—' never to speak without having some
thing to «ay "
In the outset he would state that he had not come to day for
themerepuiposeof answenngthe able and msreneous argu
ments of his eloquent friend from New York, [Mr Wright]
who addressed the Senate yesterday, and he hoped he would
pardon him if he should not pay as much attention to his
speech m dptad as its confessed ability would justify
His object was to present his views in a plam manner—fully
aware that no diess in which he could clothe them would have
any efTest on public opinion nor could he say that he had any
desire hisdeclaiationsehould have that influence He left such
impressions to be made on the public mind by the orthodox
fathers of the church m political matters His dependence for
effect was upon a simple array of fact=< and not upon rheton
cal flout ishes which others could wield <?o much more dexte
rously than he Indeed he did not know that a great deal was
gamed by such rhetorical flourishes for he had been an obser
ver of publir men during the la-it ten years and the result of
his observation was at last, a conviction that the speaker who
relip^ on a well arranged statement of fatts, always accom
pl'shes more, and reaches his object mu^h sooner than the
speaker who places his chief íehance upon what is called elo
quent declama ion
He liad said that it was no pait of his purpose to answer, in
iletail the very able speech of the Seratoi iron New York he
would however, select fron his remarks one or two topics unon
which he fel him elf bound to enter somewhat atlaiee The
first topic he should select wa", that of the D tribution act of
the late extra session Before he to kit up hxwever hB would
íemark that he had spoken to one or twoofhisbrotf er Senators
on the bubjeptoftbe ¡senes cf resolutions now under dihCu&sion
an 1 found they concuired with him in con idering them as a
sytem of policy so vast and impouant in th* r consequences
that it would be improper to despatch them with a n eie curso
i y cui^ de a ion I was therefor ti lie c\f ected tl at they
wouMehci nuch deiate and he had accoid ngly, expected
the Semtot from "New Yoik would have taken tl e rpso u'tons
m detail and devoted to each much moit, attention than he had
He appealed to have selected the fifth because pi obably he
tno lghl it the most \ nlncrable Be that as it nay, the Senator
] al bestowed on it his chief assaults
\ though lie (Mr s* iith ) on thp introduction of the Distri
button bid at the ex i a session had e^rre^edh g «entimen «* m
relation t> the measure the deoate upon it which foi o a ed had
rendei*d it necessary that he should prepare himself for a reply
to the arguments in oppr<=¡ tion and as the discussion proceded
he did ^o But it woull be íecol ected that, fowards the con

HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES.
Thdesdat, March 3,1842
The Jeurnal of jesterday was read and ap-
proved.
On leave given, petitions were presented by ihe
following gentlemen, and were appropriately re-
ferred-
From New York  ByMr.RIGGS.
From Delaware: By Mr RODNEY, -who pre-
sented the petition of John Jones, asking additional
compensation for work done upon the Pea Patch
island, in fulfilment of the contract mad? by the
Government.
TEMPERANCE.
The unfinished business was Ihe motion made
last evening by Mr. Bowne (pending whi"h ihe
Houce bad adjourned) that the rnles of the House
be suspended for the purpose of enabling him to
introduce a resolution grant ng th* use of the Hall
to the Congressional To al Abstinence Society for
Monday evening next
Mr SNYDER asked the ye?s and nay?; which
were refused.
And the question being taken, the rules we
suspended, and the resolution, without debáis or
division, was adopted.
PRINTING UNDER THE SIXTH CENSUS
Mr THOMPSON of Indiana, on leave given,
introduced a j mt resolution, rr¡ vidn g that the
nionejs heretofore appnprated by Coigress 'o
pay ihe exp"n«es ct the Sixth Census be so far sus-
pended, as that no more sh-11 be pud lot ih° print-
ing of the papers urder the s^m ensus until the
further ordsr of Congress.
[Mr. T had given notice last evering of bis in-
tention to psk leave to m roduce tbi^ íesoluiien,
but the title thereof did not ¡each the ear of tha
Et-porter ]
Tne resolution was read, and, without oivision
or deba'p, was pdop'ed

REFORT ON RETRENCHMENT
The u nm^a'd business cf ihe morning hour was
ihe ¡hird of the ser es of ihe re^olu ions reported
fr<  n the Select Comrm"ec on Re'icnchment, m the
following words
Resolved, That the office of lliaughtpmanof tht House be,
and the same lsheieby atohshel
Which said re-olution Mr JOHN G FLOYD
had moved to amei d by in ertmg the words "and
postmastPi "
Mr HOPKINS had yesterday sugge^'ed lo Mr.
Flotd tbat the abolition of 'he office of postmas-
ter would render useless all the officers therewith
connected, and that they, therefo'e, thould be in-
cluded in ihe amendment
The Reporter did not hear Mr Floyd accept Ihe
modification, which, hon ever, it seems, as ^he ques-
tion stood upon the journal, he did.
So the amendment read as follow :
Insert after the words "draughtsman 10 the
House" the words "and the postmaster and all offi-
cers connected with tbe post office "
The indefinite lanauage of the resolution gavo
me to some doubt, suggested by Mr. MORGAN,
vhethor the Postmaster Genera! or tbe prs mas er
of the Hou«e was intended to be abolished by this
res-o'ution. It appeared, however, to 1 e fin* ly
understood that Mr McCormick and no> Mr
Wickliffe was referred to.
The immediately pending quest on ri> on the
demand made yesterday by Mr MORGAN tor
the previous question, (pending which demand th'
morning hour had expired, and the Hou°e ba
passed to the orders of the day )
