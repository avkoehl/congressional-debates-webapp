precautions for insuring the health of troops, which the united experience of the armies of Europe and our own has shown to be indispensable to their efficiency.

I have unceasingly impressed upon all officers of this department the primary importance of carrying into effect sanity measures to prevent sickness, and my suggestion and directions have been carried out with an intelligence and zeal which it affords me great satisfaction to bring to the notice of the commanding general.

It also me pleasure to state that the medial officers have found their military commanders, with very few exceptions, willing to carry into effect their suggestions to their end.

Much, very much, still remains to be done; but the earnestness and ability of the medical officers of this army to which I have alluded, and to which much of the improvement the health of the troops is due, give the assurance that, so far as depends upon their exertions, nothing will be left undone to raise to a still higher degree the effective strength of the Army of the Potomac.

Respectfully returned to the Secretary of War with the accompanying report of Major J. R. Smith, U. S. Army, by whose action the report of the medical director of the Army of the Potomac was published.

I am sure Dr. Smith was actuated by on improper motive, and that his conduct was an inadvertence, to which the best of us are liable.
