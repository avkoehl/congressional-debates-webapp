The Tariff—Mr. Brooks.

tory in Massachusetts, tile duty was made 5
cents per pound; and Michigan then got the
vote of Massachusetts only by a compact of
this sort! On Florence leaf or Dutch metal,
which the manufacturers of paper-hangings
use, the duty was raised from 10 per cent, to
45 per cent., under the plea that one of its
component parts was copper, though the arti-
cle contains but 8 per cent, of copper. Hence
paper-hangings, stamped gold paper, now come
from the other side instead of being manufac-
tured here; for the duty of 45 per cent, on this
8 per cent, of copper discriminates against the
American manufacturer.
The increase of duty has destroyed or dam-
aged two manufactories of copper, destroyed
one outright in Boston, at the entrance of its
harbor, which ought thereto act as a beacon to
warn Massachusetts against such foolish legis-
lation, and damaged or crippled another in
Baltimore.
An honorable gentleman from Michigan in
the Fortieth Congress (Mr. Driggs) tempted
the House to impose a heavy duty upon im-
ported copper, to give a bounty to the copper
miners of Lake Superior; and he did it with
the belief, I have no doubt, that it would run
up the price of the article. My honorable col-
league on the Ways and Means, from Michi-
gan, [Mr. Blair,] cooperated with him; but
the result has been just the reverse of what
the honorable gentlemen expected—as in the
case of wool. Copper ingot in 1868 was 22
cents per pound, by the ingot; and pending the
agitation for the bounty increase from 2J to 5
cents per pound, the price ran up to 24£ and
25 cents; but after the levy of the 45 per cent,
it ran down soon to 22 and 23 cents, and it is
now only 20J cents per pound. So that the
copper producer of Michigan, instead of reap-
ing the benefit of his increased bounty has had
the article left upon his hands 3 or 4 cents less
than he might have had but for the bounty
sought for here.
masufactVeed iron and stetci,.
In the opening of the debate, when this bill
was first reported, I stated that the duty on
manufactured iron was raised on most of the
articles in this bill. The honorable gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Kelley] denied the
fact. _ Between an assertion on his part and an
assertion on mine, I did not suppose either of
us could, without demonstration, bring others
in the House to our belief of our statement and
of our facts. Therefore I resorted to outside
testimony, and the best and most irresistible
that could be got; and I hold in my hands the
verification ofmy statementfrom large import-
ing houses, not foreign, but American houses
of the very highest respectability in New York.
I have statements from the house of Oothout
& Co., an old Knickerbocker house of over 30
years' standing, I think, and of Sampson &
Brother, showing the rates of increase in this
bill as proposed by the Committee of Ways and
Means ; and these I append.
Let me say, however, before I go into those
facts, that the iron classification in this bill
from the Committee of Ways and Means—
which I may as well say just here came to us
from Pennsylvania, and is not all our own—is a
most ingeniously arranged bill to throw dust
into the eyes of the people, and to blind the
members of this House as to the exact real
effect of the proposed legislation. Nothing
more ingenious could well be Contrived by
human legislative ingenuity. I could not tell
at first, and I do not believe any member of
the committee could then tell what it meant.
I therefore resorted to Oothout & Co., and
Sampson^ & Brother, as well as to other houses
ia NewYorkforinformationandforthe devel-
opment of this ingenious classification, and
their verification shows the following increase
of rates in this bill over the present tariff:
Statement of the house of Oothout, one of the oldest houses in New York, and of Knicker-
bocker origin.
Hon. James Brooks, M. C„ Washington, D. C.:
In answer to your inquiries as to how far the proposed tariff bill reported by General Schestok from the
Ways and Means Committee, either increases or decreases the duty on iron or steel, we hereby give you
the following result.
Your obedient servant, W. OOTHOUT, 3 Cliff street.

Statement of the house of Sampson & Brother.
New York, February 12,1870.
Sir: In answer to your letter we have to state:
That under the tariff in force in and prior to 1860,
which was a revenue tariff, the duty levied and
collected upon all descriptions of iron was 24 per
cent, ad valorem, and upon certain descriptions of
steel 12 per cent. In 1861 the tariff was changed
to specific rates, amended in 1862, and again in 1864,
which last amendment, with its varied and perplex-
ing schedules and classifications, is now in force;
and it is between the ad valorem act of 24 per cent.,
the present, and theproposed specific rates that these
comparisons are made. We state farther that the
present and proposed acts levy duties on iron, ac-
cording to width, thickness in inches, (or fractions
thereof,) and gauges, ranging from 1 cent to 1$ cent
per pound; and both are arranged with peculiar skill,
so as to assess the highest rates in many instances
on those articles most in demand. The calculations
we annex tabulated, so they can be understood at a
glance :
We present—
First. The sterling cost free on board in Liverpool.
Second. The sterling cost in gold dollars/at $4 84
per pound sterling.
Third. The ad valorem, rate of 1860, or 24 per cent.
Fourth. The present specific duty.
Fifth. The amount in dollars of increase over the
ad valorem duty, and the percentage of such increase.
Sixth. The relation or ratio of present duty to the
sterling cost.
Seventh. The proposed duty.
Eighth. The ratio of increase in the proposed over
ad valorem duty.
Ninth. The ratio of proposed duty to sterling cost
in percentage, all of which calculations are in gold.
Tenth. To proposed duty we add 20 per cent, pre-
mium on gold.
Eleventh. The currency increase in dollars and
cents over thq ad valorem rate, and tho percentage
of such increase.
# v * * it-
Hi is proper to state a difficulty occurs in arriving
at.a satisfactory sterling value in England, as the
price in 1860 was much lower than now; but this is
worse for the protectionists, as the lower the sterling
cost the greater ia tho percentage of increase over
that cost.
