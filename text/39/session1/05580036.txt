APPENDIX -TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[December 4,
Ho. of Reps.
Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
39th Cong.... 1st Sjsss.
articles for which there has been a demand,
have been, with slight fluctuations, constantly
advancing from the commencement of-the war,
and are higher now, with gold at forty-seven
per cent, premium, than they were when it was
at one hundred and eighty-five. Even those
which were affected by the fall of gold upon the
surrender of the confederate armies, or by the
increased supply or diminished demand, are
advancing again to former if not higher rates.
The expansion has now rcached such a point
as to .be absolutely oppressive to a large por-
tion of the people, while at the same time it is
diminishing labor, and is becoming subversive
of good morals.
There are no indications of real and per-
manent prosperity in our large importations of
foreign fabrics; in the heavy operations at our
commercial marts; in the splendid fortunes re-
ported ,to bo made by skillful manipulations at
the gold room or the stock board; no evidences
oi increasing wealth in the facts that railroads
and steamboats are crowded with passengers,
and hotels with guests; that cities are full to
overflowing, and rents and the prices of the
necessaries of life, as well as luxuries, are daily
advancing. All these things prove rather that
« foreign debt is being created, that the num-
ber oi' non-producers is increasing, and that
productive industry isj>eiiig diminished. There
is no fact more manifest than that the plethora
of paper money is not only undermining the
morals of the people by encouraging waste and
extravagance, but is striking at the root of our
material prosperity by diminishing labor. The
evil is not at present beyond the-control of legis-
lation, but it is daily increasing, and, if not
speedily checked, will, at no distant day, cul-
minate in wide-spread disaster. The remedy,
and the only remedy within the control of Con-
gress is, in the opinion of the Secretary, to be
found in the reduction of the currency.
The paper circulation of the United States,
on the 01st of October last, was substantially
as follows:
1. United. States notes and fractional
currency   8454,218,038 20
Z holes oi the national.banks  185,000,000 00
o. JNotes oi fetute banks, including out-
standingibsues ol'tfutebankscon-
vertcd into national banks  65,000,000 00
$704,218,038 20
_ The amount of notes furnished to the na-
tional banks up to #ud including the 31st of
October, was a little over $205,000,000, but it
is estimated that §20,000,000 of these had not
then been put into circulation.
In addition to the United States notes, there
were also outstanding $32,536,900 five per cent,
treasury notes, and_$173,012,140 compound-
interest notes, of which it would, doubtless, be
safe to estimate that $30,000,000 were in cir-
culation as currency.
_ From this statement it appears that, without
including seven and three-tenths notes, many
ot the small denominations of which were in
circulation as money, and all of which tend in
some measure to swell the inflation, ihe paper
money of the country amounted, on the 31st of
October, to the sum of $734,218,038 20, which
has been daily increased by the notes since fur-
nished to the national banks, and is likely to
be still further increased by those to which
they are entitled, until the amount authorized
bylaw ($300,000,000) shall have been reached,
subject to such reduction as inay be made by
the withdrawal of the notes of the State banks.
The following is a statement of the bank-
note circulation of the country at various pe-
riods of highest and lowest issues prior to the
war:
January, 1830 $61,324,000
January, 183-> 103,692,405
January, 1836 140,301,038
January, 1837 149,185,890
January, 1843  58,564,000
January, 18o6 196,747:950
January, 18d7 214,778,822
January, l o8 155,208,344
January, 1800 207,1«2,0()0
It will be noticed by this statement that
the bank-note circulation of the United States
increased from $61,324,000 to $1-19,185,890
between the 1st of January, 1830, and the
1st of January, 1837, in which latter year the
great financial collapse took place; fell from
ijl49,185,890 in 1837, to $58,564,000 in 1843,
and rose to $214,778,822 on the 1st of Jan-
uary , 1857,in which year the next severe crisis oc-
curred j falling duringth^tyeijr to $155,208,344,
and rising te $2Q7,]$2,§0O oil :tiie 1st of Jan-
uary, 18G0.
The following is a statement Qf bank deposits
and loans in the same years:

January 1, 1860 253,802,000 691,915,000
On the 30th of September, the date of their
last quarterly reports, the deposits and loans of
the national banks (the Secretary has no reli-
able returns of these items from the few re-
maining State banks) were as follows:
Deposits, individual ajid.Government 5544,160,194
Loans  :..$485,313,029
To which should be add-
ed—
Investments in United States
bonds and other United
States securities  427,731,600
 §913,045,629
These figures are history in themselves,
exhibiting not only the past and present condi-
tion of ihe country, in matters of exceeding
interest, but indicating unerringly the danger-
ous direction in which the financial current is
sweeping.
On the 1st of January of the memorable year
1837, the bank-note circulation of the United
States was $149,185,890, the deposits were
$127,397,000, the loans $525,115,000. In Jan-
uary,^ 1857, tho year of the next great crisis,
the circulation was $214,778,822, tho deposits
were $230,351,000, the loans $084,456,000.
There are no statistics to exhibit the amount of
specie actually in circulation in those periods,
but it would be a liberal estimate to put it at
$30,000,000 for 1837, and $50,000,000 for 1857.
These wereyears.of great inflation, the effects
of which have been already referred to—the
revulsion of 1837 no,t only producing great im-
mediate embarrassment, but a prostration which
continued until 1843, at the commencement of
which year the bank-note circulation amounted
only to $58,564,000, deposits to $50,108,000,
loans $254,544,000—flour having declined in
New York from $10 25 perbarr.elon the ls^of
January, 1837, to $4 69 on the lstof January,
1843, and other articles in about the same pro-
portion.
The reaction in 1857 was severe, but, for the
reason before stated, less disastrous and pro-
tracted.
On the 30th of September last, the deposits
of the national banks alone amounted to
$544,150,19-1; their loans — estimating their
national securities as a loan to the Government
—to $913,045,029; both of which items must
have been increased during the month of Octo-
ber ; while on the 31st ol' that month thp cir-
culation, bank and national, had reached the
startling amount of upward of $700,000,000.
Nothing beyond this statement is required to
exhibit the present inflation or to explain the
causes of the current and the advancing prices.
If disaster followed the expansions of 1837 and
1857, what must be the consequences of the
present expansion unless speedily checked and
reduced!
It is undoubtedly true that trade is carried
on much more largely for cash than was ever the
ease previous to 1861, and that there is a much
greater proper demand for money than there
would be if sales were made, as heretofore, on
credit. It is _ also true that there is a larger
demand than formerly for money on the part
of manufacturers for the payment of opera-
tives. But, making the most liberal allowances
for the increased wholesome demand arising
from these causes and from the advance of the
country in business andpopulation, it is appar-
ent from the foregoing statements, if the ad-
vance in prices did not establish the fact, that
the circulating medium of the country is alto-
gether excessive.
B.efore concluding his remarks upon this sub-
ject, it may be proper for the Secretary, even
at the expense of repetition, to notice briefly
some of the popular and plausible objections
to a reduction of the currency:
First. That by reducing prices it would oper-
ate injuriously, if not disastrously, upon trade,
and be quite likely to precipitate a financial
crisis.
To this it may be replied, that prices of arti-
cles of indispensable necessity are already so
high as to be severely oppressive to consum-
ers, especially to persons of fixed and moderate
incomes and to the poorer classes. Not only
do the interests, but the absolute necessities
of the masses require that the prices of articles
needed for their use should decline.
Nor is there any reason to apprehend, by any
policythat Congress may adopt, so rapid a
reduction of prices as to produce very serious
embarrassment .to trade. The Government
currency can only, to auy considerable extent,
be withdrawn by a sale of bonds, and -the de-
mand for bonds will be so affected by the state
of the market that a rapid contraction will be
difficult, if not impossible, even if it were de-
sirable. There is more danger to be appre-
hended from the inability of tho Government
to reduce its circulation rapidly enough, than
from a too rapid reduction of it. It is, in part,
to prevent a financial crisis, that is certain to
come without it, that Ihe Secretary recommends
contraction. Prices are daily advancing. The
longer contraction is deferred, the greater must
the fall eventually be, and the more serious will
be its consequences. It is not expected that a
return to specie payments will bring prices back
to the standards of former years. The great
increase of tho precious metals and high taxes
will prevent this; but this consideration makes
it the more important that all improper and
unnecessary influences in this direction should
be removed.
Again, it is urged that a contraction of the
currency wou^d reduce the public revenues.
_ It is possible that this might be the imme-
diate effect, but it would be temporary only.
The public revenues depend upon the develop-
ment of our national resources, upon our sur-
plus productions; in other words, upon labor.
The revenues derived from transactions based
upon a false standard ol value, or from interests
that can only flourish in speculative times, are
not those upon which reliaueo can be placed
for maintaining the public credit. What a
healthy and reliable business requires is a sta-
ble basis. This it cannot have as long as the
country is inflicted with an inconvertible cur-
rency, the value of which, as well as the value
of the vast property which is measured by it,
is fluctuating and unreliable, and may be in no
small degree controlled by speculative combi-
nations.
It is also urged that the proposed policy
would endanger the public credit, by prevent-
ing funding; and that it would compel the Gov-
ernment and the people, who are in debt, to
pay in a dearer currency than that in which
their debts were contracted.
The Secretary is unable to perceive any sub-
stantial ground for this objection. He cannot
understand how the process of funding is likely
to be aided by the continuance of prices on
their present high level, or how the credit cf
the Government is to be restored by the per-
petuation of an irredeemable currency, espe-
cially as that currency consists largely of its
own notes. While it is hoped that early pro-
