HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
MojvD4Y, March 31, 1834
In pursuance of theiuleof tne House, the States
were cahed foi thepiesentationof petitions, n emo
riulb, &e , begin mig with Mississippi, wheie the
call was suspended on Monday last, af er the
pie entation by Mi CAGE of the resolutions of
sundiy cit zens of ISatchtz, condemning there
noval of the deposites, and lecommendti g their
íestoration, die
Mi PLUMMER said that he had not niflic ed
on the House a speech dining its present ^ettSion
His silence dm ng all tl is t me had not been ov ing
to a want of coi iidence in nimself, so nuch as to
ill health The ague and fevei uitii wh ch he hat 
been a'Bicted during the chil'mg bias's of wintei,
had, on the open ng of spnnsr, left him suffeimg
under a much moiefasl lonable and prevalen di:>
ease in this climate It was a disease common to
most of tne riembe s of Cmgiess, and seemed to
be contagious it ws not his puipose to enter
into a discussion of the various symptoms of the
disease in its. diffeient Siases, noi was he capable
of throwing any hght on tl e subject, although he
had paid some attention to ti e effect  which it had
on both the body and mmd The general symp-
toms, he said, were an appaient restlessness of the
whole body, palpita ion of the heait and uneasi
ness of mind It frequently caused the features of
the patient to be distorted, muttering a jargon of
high sounding and unmeaning words sometimes
it affecte 1 him in a mannei rot unh! e the hydio
phobi8, caus ng foaming at the mouth, at others,
stamping of the feet, clenching of the fists, toisc
and ieanud looks and ludicrous motions of the
arms and othei parts of the body, and not unfre-
quently a peiveision of the truth Owing to the
Want of a classical education he did not undeisiand
the technicalities of the learned proftbsion^, but he
had heal d those who talked Greek and spoke Latin
call the disease of which he had spoken the " Ca
cocthes loquendi " It was, he said, considered
incurable, tempoiary lehef might, howeve , be ob-
tained, bytalkmgfrona o"eto thretdays Although
the membeis of the House might have cause to
legret it, he most heaitily congratulated himself
on a change of diseases He no longei felt in
clmedto yawn, pains in his bones, and cold flashes
running up his back, intimations of the apptoach-
mg ague, but he felt strong symptoms of the other
disease Unless, howevei, his ease s-iould become
more aggravated than it was at present, he trusted
that he should not occupy the time of the House
long on the subject under con^ideranon If, m the
few lemarks he mtenaed to submit he should fail
to command the attention of the House, he hoped
that he should be so well satisfied v/ith his own
efloit.ts not to beundei the necessity of procuring
an anonymous puff of himself to be published in
thenewspapers, no. of faint g into tue isshionab'e
practice of addressing a note to the editors, com
I plaining of the reporters, because they do not
make a good speech out of a bad one, or because
they fail to re; ort what he would have said, if he
hi 1 not foigotten it
Mr P said, when he rose to address the House
the other day on the presentation bv his colleague
of the íesoiutions uijei consideration, he did not
inte id to occupy moie time than would have been
necessai y to correct an erroneous impression made
| hen  urd ekewhere m relation to publi" sentiment
m Mi-.& ssippi on the all engrossing subject of the
bank Slice tha' time circums anees have devel-
oped themselves which had caused him to consider
it due to the House, to tie country, to his con-
stituents, and to h n self, t lathe should rise in his
phce -ind peak fortn the words of truth and sober-
ness He did i ot inte id, however, to di«cuss at
tl at_ time the merits or the bank question, nor
inquire into trie legality or expediency of the con-
duet of the Secretary of the Tieasoiy m removing
the public deposites from the Rink of the United
States to the local ms'itutions He rose more pm-
t cularly foi the purpose of explaining some of the
i easons why he could not consistently comply with
tl e i equests of his constituents who composed the
meeting that adopted the resolutions under con-
sideration     He agreed with them in the opinions
I therein expressed relative to the appaiently pros-
perous condition of the State of Mississippi a few
months ago and the present distress ef which they
i complained, but diffeied with them altogether as
to the origin of these difficulties and reveises, and
was opposed to the remedy which they recom-
mended It was unnecessaiy, he presumed, for
him to bear testimony to the high standing and
lespectability ot those who=e names weie men-
t oned in the resolutions 1 he most of them were
known tobóme of the gentlemen on thatflooi ,and,
to say the l-ist of it, as favorably known as those
wro had the honor of repiesenting them There
were (ne said) several gentlemen in his eye besides
his honorable collogue who would not hesitate to
vouch foi ihe names of Whkms, Grayson, Quit-
man, Bingaman, and Mernll The right of the
oeopje to instinct the lepresertatives of their own
choice ihe said) was one which he held more
sacred than ary other light claimed oi exercised
bv the citizens of i free Government He held
tnat it vas the imperious duty of the Representa-
tive, who was the public servant of the people, to
obey the mandates of his constitaents on all ques-
tions of expediency, when clearly expressed He
went farther, and admitted that it was the bounden
duty of a Representative to obey the known will
of ins constituents on all questions which might
come befoie him, either of a general or a local
nature, or resort to the other alternative, and fol-
low the piaiseworthy example set them by a dis-
tinguished gentleman from Virginia a short time
I since in the other end of the building
' What is the will of the people,and whether there
has or has not been a fair expression of that will,
aie ouest ons of which every one must judge for
himself, and upon his own respons bihty He
professed to know the sentiments of thegreatmass
of the people of Mississippi as well, but not better,
than any other man He had been among them
from boyhood He had grown with their growth,
and strengthened w th then stiength, and under-
took to asseit that thiee vfouiths of the whole
number of voters in the State were opposed to a
reohaiter of the United States Bank, and, conse-
quently, to a restoiation of the deposites He
might, be said, be mistaken in his opinion with
regard to public sentiment m Mississippi, but as
e/idence ot his sincerity, he was willing to stake
his popularity, which he prized as high as any
man, and all of his political prospects on the ques-
tion, if those who differed with him in opinion
chose to make up an losue on that subject, before
the peop'e of that State
In 182o, the General Assembly of Mississippi
paused a set of joint lesolutions remonstrating
against the introduction of a branch of the United
States Bank within the limits of that State Mr
P siiü he was a meml ei of the I egislature which
adopted tnose resolutions, and gave them his
support In 1829 and lc-30, efforts were made to
repeal the «solutions, and mvite the location of
a branch within the State, which he opposed
They were not repealed until the next session of
tne LegUatuie, after he became a member elect of
