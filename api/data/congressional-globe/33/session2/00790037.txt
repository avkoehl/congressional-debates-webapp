be fairly estimated at from six to eight dollars a
ton at the place of consumption, showing that the
people of the United States are paying for this,
one of the great necessaries of life, between sixty
and eighty millions of dollars per annum, under a
tariff levied upon them which, as hereinbefore
stated, is full forty-five per cent, protection
Mr. STRAUB. Will the gentleman yield the
floor one moment, and permit me to ask him a
single question ?
Mr. WALBRIDGE. Certainly.
Mr. STRAU B. The gentleman from. New
York has told us that the price per ton of coal was
from six to eight dollars, and the aggregate cost to
the consumers about eighty million dollars. If my
memory serves me right, the quantity of anthra-
cite mined and delivered in 1853, was a fractiQn
over five million tons; how, then, the learned
gentleman can prove the whole amount of cost to
the consumers to he eighty million dollars, he will
please inform the House.
Mr. WALBRIDGE. I answer the gentleman
by referring him to the statistics which I produce.
Nor is this protective principle of legislation,
respecting this great necessary of life, of recent
origin. For we find since the formation of the
Government a heavy restriction has been con-
stantly laid upon this indispensable article.
In 1789 the tariff on coal per ton, of twenty-
eight bushels, was fifty-six penis, or twenly-two
per cent, on its value. Oar importations that year
were 3,850 tons.
In 1800 the duty was p 40 per ton, fifty-six
per cent, on its value, and we imported 11,787
tons.
In 1810, same duty, our importations reached
14,030 ions.
In 1815, after the war, and under a duty of
$2 80, or one hundred and twelve percent, on the
value per ton, our importations fell to 3,514 tons.
In 1820, under duty of $1 40 per ton, being
fifty-six per cent, on its value, we imported
24,061 tons.
In 1825, with a duty of $1 G8, we imported
25 795 tons.
in 1830, with the same duty, we imported
58,583 tons.
In 1835, under the compromise tariff of 1833,
with a duty, say of £1 40 per ton, wc imported
59,972 tons.
The protective tarilT of August 30, 1842, con-
tinued in force until the present tarifl look effect,
1st December, 1840, the duty on coal reaching
$1 75 per ton.
In IM3 our importations readied -11,15.1 tons.

During the four years last mentioned, we have
imported an aggregate of f<ja2 tons, valued,
according to a Treasury statement in my posses-
sion, certified November 21, 1851, at $1,970,179,
or, at a geneial average of four years, §2 23 per
ton; and the aggregate duty paid on the same is
$591,053 70.
The scarcity of fuel and the demand for coal
bad, undoubtedly, their full share in influencing
the amount of importations at the several periods
mentioned. This demand for coal is still rapidly
augmenting, having risen in the last filly years
from 15,000 tons per annum to an annual con-
sumption of 10,000,000, and yet being continually
on the increase.
It is only within the last fifteen years that the
United States-have become, strictly speaking, a
coal-producing country. A quarter of a century
previous to that period there were not more than
one thousand tons of anthracite coal annually
produced in the whole Union; yet, in 1847 the
increase alone had reached to more than one
thousand tons per day, and has since increased,
and is still increasing almost in a compound latio.

The ability of the American producer to suc-
cessfully compete with the foreign importer, even
after the present protective restriction shall have
been removed, is beyond question. Look at our
superior facilities for the extraction and transpor-
tation of the article, the constantly increasing
demand, and the extent of our coal-producing
regions in comparison with those of Europe and
the British possessions on this continent.
It is to be remembered that the coal we import
is mostly from Great Britain and her North Amer-
ican dependencies. The aggregate of square miles
of coal-producing countries in Europe, viz: Great
Britain, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales; Spain in
the Astunas region, France, Belgium, Prussian
dominions, Austrian provinces, and the British
dependencies in North America, is 852,229 square
miles—the coal region of which embraces about
35,504 square miles, or a little more than one
twenty-fourth pait.
The United States contain, exclusive of Texas,
Oregon, and Washington—the lasttwo abounding
extensively in this mineral—some2,800,000 square
miles. The twelve coal States, viz: Alabama,
Georgia, Tennessee, Kentucky, Virginia, Mary-
land, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Pennsylvania, Mich-
igan, and Missouri, embrace an aggregate surface
of 5(>5,2rt3 square miles; of which the coal region
covers 133,132 square miles, or nearly one quarter
of the entire area of these States, producing, in
1850, while yet in the infancy of this great staple,
according to the census returns of that year,
5,049,954 tons.
The annual coal produce of Great Britain proper,
Belgium, France, Prussia, Austria, and Spain, in
1853, was within a fraction of 51,000,000 tons. In
that year Pennsylvania alone produced 7,000,000
tons, and Maryland more than 500,000 tons.
The produce and consumytion in the United
States for 1854 may with safety be estimated at
10,000,000 tons. Yet, notwithstanding this article
is so abundant in our country, and our facilities
for its supply so great, the pricc has risen, within
the last year, from thirty to fifty per cent., and
within the last five years nearly one hundred per
cent.
With almost illimitable resources at home, I can
see no good reason for continuing the present
exorbitant duty on coal, which, in my opinion,
should be a free article; and the earlier the foreign
coal ia brought into competition with our domestic
the better it will certainly be for the consumer.
Nor in a series of years will this prove any detri-
ment to the American producer, whose energies
will be directed to the proper application of all the
facilities possible for the cheapest mining, trans-
portation, and its delivery on the most reasonable
terms; while, as a matter of revenue to the coun-
try, it is not only not wanted, but absolutely det-
rimental to our general interests. Not a railway
is made and equipped with engines and cars, nor
a stenmsiup constructed, hut iron is required,
and, in its manufacture, coal is the material used
for the propulsion of the requisite machinery. The
growth of the iron manufacture and trade in the
United States, so intimately connected with the
coal trade within the last forty yeais,is enormous
—keeping pace, if not in advance of, the strides
in every other department of human industry. In
1810 wc had 153 furnaces, producing 54,000 tons
of pig iron. In JM5 we had 510 blast furnaces,
| averaging 900 tons each annually, yielding 480,000
11 tons, and 950 bloomenes, forges, rolling and split-
ting mills, yielding, of bar hoops, iCe., 291,000
tons, and of blooms, castings, machinery, and
stove plates, 151,500 tons—making that year an ag-
gregate of 929,100 tons, at the value of §33,910,500.
in 1853 the rapid increase in this branch of man-
ufacture was such us to yield much more than
1,000.000 tons of pig iron.
Some idea may be formed of the increasing de-
mand for coal, by even a glance at the multiplied
uses to which it is applied. We have now in
active operation 20,000 miles of railway commu-
nication, ata cost of$600,000.000,and the system
is advancing, stretching its arms, Briareus like,
far and wide over the Union, in the ratio of the
expansion of population, and the growth of the
country.
The steam marine of the United States in 1852,
was ] ,390 vessels, with an aggregate of 417,226
tons, of which 96 were ocean steamers, 523 engaged
in the coast trade, and 765 employed on inland nav-
igation. Such has been the increase of our steam
commercial marine within the last two years, that
it would not be extravagant to estimate our steam
marine for 3854, at 1,800 vessels, with an aggre-
gate steam tonnage of 540,000 tons. _
A quarter of a century ago the power of steam
upon land, and upon the ocean, was comparatively
unknown, and the vast and unmeasured material
which waked this power into life, slumbered .in
our soil.
But the use of coal for the creation of motive
power upon railroads and in steam navigation,
both inland and ocean, furnishes but an inade-
quate idea of its extensive application and value
to the country. *
" Coal has been forcibly described as the indis-
pensable aliment of industry. It is a primary
material, engehdermg force; giving a power supe-
rior to that of natural agents, sucli as water, air,
&c., procure. It is to industry what oxygen is
to the lungs, water to the plant, nourishment to
the animal. It is to coal we owe our steam and
gas. It replaces in the workshops and domestic
hearths the charcoal which had become too costly
under the last head; in our northerly latitudes it
is destined always to acquire increasing and more
general use. The employment of coal will be
henceforward no other than a question of cheap-
ness, and in the present age the first interest of in-
dustry is d!bove all to see ameliorated the ways of
communication, to lower the tolls upon the routes
and canals."
When Crcesus exhibited his golden treasures,
some one told him that he who possessed iron
could soon make himself master of them. The
ownership of the gold of the Aztecs and the Incas
yielded to the iron and steel of the Spanish in-
vader.
The Creator, with a bounteous hand, has fur-
nished us with a coal region with an extent and
richness, as I trust I have shown, unequaled by
any political community on the face of the earth,
and almost as exhaustless as the atmosphere by
which we arc surrounded. The means for the
extraction of this one of the great necessaries of
life are at hand, and all that human ingenuity and
enterprise could desire; and from these rich de-
posits a stream of wealth, now swollen, flows
into the coffers of the producer. When we reflect
that that article under a high protective tariff ia
becoming, and to a great extent has become, an
indispensable agent in every household—that it
is daily growing into universal use for all domes-
tic purposes—that it is indispensable in the ma-
chinery which fashions with artistic skill and
elegance the implements used and necessary in
every family—that it is equally needed and em-
ployed in the manufacture of farming utensils and
tools in the mechanic arts—in travel by land and
by water; indeed, for all the arts of peace, and
equally indispensable in the art of war, and for
all the means of national defense, is there any
reason why there should be an oppressive and un-
necessary tax upon that which so seriously affects
the interests of every citizen of the Republic?
Every principle of justice demands that the
shackles on this trade, which the existing tariff
imposes, should be stricken off, and that the
traffic of this important article should be opened
to the freest competition.
lu conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I have endeavored
to attract the attention of this body to the subject,
rather by a brief summary of the interests in-
volved, than by any attempt at elaborate argument.
The days of this session are rapidly diminishing.
The business of the country requires, in fact, de-
mands, brevity in discussion and promptitude of
action. As one of the representatives in part of the
city of New York, the great commercial capital of
this continent, it becomes my duty, from which I
could not shrink, to press the matter upon this
body. My constituents have a right to expect and
require it at my hands. They demand that the
abundance of Europe, which the producer there
can supply, shall be brought at once to our shores,
that they may have the relief created by a proper
competition. A city with a population of 750,000
souls, of 175,000 families, employ it for domestic
purposes. The manufacturing interests in the
furnaces, forges, and all the engines employed in
the useful arts, require it. The trading community
