Major-General BURNSIDE,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

Five thousand arms will be placed at your disposal in Cincinnati. General Meade does not believe that any of Ewell's forces have gone west. A part, at least, of Longstreet's corps has gone to Atlanta.

It is believed that Bragg, Johnston, and Hardee, with the unexchanged prisoners from Vicksburg and Port Hudson, are concentrating against Rosecrans. You must give him all the aid in you power. Not hearing from you I directed your adjutant-general at Cincinnati to push forward all available troops.
