pedpte could be taxed, and the money thrown out,
and the pfcoplfe taxed again to get it back.
Hereferred to the arguments of Mr. Yintov, who
(he said) had objected to this scheme because it
would be an opening of this country too much to the
people, and would induce them out of these manu-
facturing establishments. Mr J. took the ground
that ours was, and must necessarily be, an agri-
cultural country,; anfltif they were allowed to take
this land at prices they were able to pay, they would
not be able to keep them off.
He' contended further in favor of this bill, that it
was the duty of the general government to pass all
liberal and necessary measures to withdraw, as soon
as possible, her jurisdiction from the States. She
fexercisfed a jurisdiction now over three-fourths of
Missouri; while Missouri exercised jurisdiction over
one-fourth of her own territory. Blib ^rasnot hence
on an equal footing with the rest of the States.
The gentleman from Maryland, [Mr. Causin,] he
said had made a flourish against this bill, that
the old States had fought, and spilt their blood for
these lands; and, therefore, he argued, the price of
them should not be reduced. He (Mr. J.) asked
if the settlers in the new States, and their fathers, did
not constitute a part of the old States the time of
this fighting, and had they not an equal claim to
them on this ground?
This bill, he argued, proposed the best mode of
ascertaining thte true value of these lands. It pro-
'posed that after they had been in mai-ket for five
years, they should ,sell at one dollar per acre, ten
years at seventy-five cents, fifteen years at fifty
cents, and twenty years at twenty-five cents This
was as direct and practicable a way as there was of
ascertaining th* reol value of the lands, and dispos-
ing of them accordingly.
Mr. J. having concluded,
Mr. HAMLIN obtained the floor; and on his
motion the committee rose and reported progress
Mr. BAYLY, on leave reported, from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, a bill for the relief of

Several bills from the Senate received their first
and second readings, and were referred to appropri-
ate committees.
Mr. SLIDELL rose to a privileged question. He
moved to reconsider the vote on laying on the table
the resolutions of the Louisiana legislature on the
subject of the annexation of Texas.
Mr, S stated that his object in moving for
a reconsideration of these resolutions was to no-
tice certain assertions which he found in the Globe
this morning as having passed in this building in re-
lation to the late presidential election in Louisiana.'
[Mr. Slidell alluded to the remarks of Senator
Barrow of Louisiana, made in the Senate-yesterday
relative to election frauds in Louisiana, published in
the Globe of last evening. The rules of the House
precluded Mr. S. from speaking of what had taken
place in the Senate.]
Mr. SCHENCK called Mr. Slidell to order.
Mr. SLIDELL said he did not intend to vio-
late the rules of order; if he should do, so, the
Speaker would call him to order. He Jiad
not been willing to intrude petty party squabbles
into the discussion of so grave a subject as the an-
nexation of art extensive territory and a gallant peo-
ple to this confederacy; and for that reason, if for
no other, would he have declined replying to the al-
lusions mnde, to election frauds in Louisiana
by an honorable gentleman from North Carolina.
Other considerations, too, existed for such forbear-
ance, which would readily suggest themselves to the
House.-
But the source from which the wholesale charge
of fraud in the Globe emanates, imperatively re-
quired that it should be promptly noticed and repel-
led.
He denied, then, emphatically that the late elec-
tion in Louisiana had been carried by fraud. He
asserted that the democratic electors received a larger
majority of legal votes thou the official canvass in--
dicates. Hfe Would freely admit that there may
have been, and probably were, instances of illegal
votes cast for the democratic ticket. Such instances
always occurred in every warmly contested election,
and more especially in districts where parties
are not rticely balanced. But he did deny that
the leaders of the democratic party in Louisiana
either encouraged or sanctioned such illegal voting.
It was true that arrrangements had been made by
the democratic party to give a property qualification
id jSeison*! having the other constitute nal requisites
as electors; but in do doing they were only acting
partially, and in a comparatively- limited district,
upon a system which the whigs had organized
throughout the State. He had no doubt whatever,
that if a balance could have been struck of every
vote on either side, illegally rejected, or illegally re-
ceived, the result would have been a large addition
to the democratic majority in the State ofLouisiana.
He had no disposition to occupy the time of the
House by entering into detailc which would proba-
bly inteiest no one there; and would, therefore, re-
serve any more extended explanation until he shotdd
have seen from some responsible person a more defi-
nite charge than had yet been made.
He would not indulge in the acrimonious lan-
guage which had been used in another part of this
building, and to which the rules of this House
would not permit him more particularly to refer.
Some palliation for it might perhaps be found in
the bitterness of disappointed hopes. But he should
feel that he Was not doing justice to the democracy
ofLouisina, if he did not declare it to be his solemn
and deliberate conviction, that nine-tenths of all
election frauds that have ever been perpetrated in
that State were of whig origin, and in favor of whig
candidates. Mr. S. then withdrew his motion.

Randall; which was twice read, and referred to the

New York: referred to the Committee of the Whole

House why the report on commerce and navigation

er any additional clerical force was necessary to en-
