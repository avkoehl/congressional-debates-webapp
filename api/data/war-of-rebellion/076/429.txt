either wait our further development or try to break through somewhere else. I think they will await our initiative, trusting to catch us in an assault. I did not learn if General Corse got that hill on his left front. I would like to get a good battery as near it as possible that will reach the heart of Atlanta and reduce it to ruins, and to keep up a fire that will prevent wagon supply trains from coming into town. There is little use of your firing from the right of your line, as that end of town is of little depth or importance. General Blair's front is the only part of your line where a sally be expected.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE, August 8, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Dispatches received. General Corps reports that he advanced within forty yards of the top of the ridge which we was to take; this at 7 p.m. The enemy resisted pretty stubbornly, but he holds his ground and is intrenched; says no one advanced on his left until 8.45, the last report from him, there being some misunderstanding, and the failure in concert of action of the part of General Williams. His communication has been referred to General Williams. General Dodge thinks they will take the ridge to-night; if not,in the morning.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, near Atlanta, Ga., August 8, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD:

Has the brigade from Decatur arrived? I would like you, if possible, to hold the line from Proctor's Creek to the north branch of Utoy. This would clearly define your line from General Thomas to General Schofield, and every yard of advance would contract your line and strengthen your reserve.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE, August 8, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

A part at least of the brigade has arrived. I will ask Dodge as to the remainder. My right now rests on the north branch of Utoy. I will reconnoiter at once with regard to the left. General Williams and myself already connect on our new line.

O. O. HOWARD,Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE TENNESSEE, August 8, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Colonel Garrard, commanding cavalry regiment, reports that several hundred enemy's cavalry have halted and gone into camp beyond Utoy
