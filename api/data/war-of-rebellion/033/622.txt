together would make nearly a full regiment of cavalry. I believe it would be wise t make this consolidation, and mount this regiment and the First Nebraska. I will then be able to dispense with nearly all the Enrolled Missouri Militia, which is very important. Please see my letter to the Adjutant-General, dated September 26.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

General Blunt was surprised by Quantrill, south of Fort Scott, on the 7th [6th]. Lose 54 of his staff and escort, killed and prisoners, and all his baggage. Shelby's force, of which I telegraphed you on the 6th, has reached Syracuse. My troops have not yet been able to strike, but I hope will bring him to fight soon.

Colonel GRAVELY, Lebanon, Mo.;

From the best information I can get, Shelby did not go beyond Warsaw. He is probably attempting to return in a southeasterly direction. Tell Colonel Morton to keep a sharp lookout, and intercept him if possible. If he can detain him a short time, General Brown will destroy him.

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Department of Saint Louis:

Arrived at 3 o'clock this afternoon. Colonel Hall telegraphs from Sedalia as follows:

At 12 m. enemy moving out of Cole Camp on the Syracuse road. Advance guard 80 strong. Large number of men.

No news here of General Brown; am afraid he has moved in the direction of Osceola. I am afraid for the La Mine Bridge to-night.

JAS. TOTTEN,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, October 9, 1863

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

I have ordered Hall to join Brown if he has to leave Sedalia. I take it for granted Brown is after Shelby.

J. M. SCHOFIELD.

Major-General.
