Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Gordon, GA., November 24, 1864.

Major General F. P. BLAIR, Commanding Seventeenth Corps:

GENERAL: Your dispatches received. I think the order of march of yesterday answers your suggestions. You can mass your rear division at Station 15, if you wish, till you secure a practicable point of crossing. If no use can be made of the railroad bridge, it must be destroyed; I will look out for the bridges across Commissioner's Creek in this vicinity, and have them destroyed. Please communicate with me at this point to-night, if possible, and let me know whether you can find any practicable point of crossing except at Ball's Ferry. If none other can be found within a reasonable distance from the railroad, your bridge will be sent there.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

P. S. --The bridge train is now here. I want you to take your section and put it in shape as soon as you can. Painful cases of robbery have come to my knowledge, as money stealing, &amp;c.

O. O. H.,

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT AND ARMY OF THE TENNESSEE,Gordon, GA., November 24, 1864--9 p. m.

Major General F. P. BLAIR, Commanding Seventeenth Corps:

GENERAL: Your dispatch is just received. You may move to Ball's Ferry. I think Osterhaus' advance reached here this evening, so that there will be no haste needed. I prefer that you should threaten the Oconee railroad bridge until your bridge is down at some other point. I will join you to-morrow. Everything is up, cattle and all, and your bridge section sent on. The approach of Slocum's column to Sandersville will make the enemy uneasy; it will be near there to-morrow.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SEVENTEENTH ARMY CORPS,November 24, 1864.

Brigadier General M. D. LEGGETT, Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-General commanding directs that you cause two miles of road to be destroyed to-night, from the station toward the town.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. CADLE, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
