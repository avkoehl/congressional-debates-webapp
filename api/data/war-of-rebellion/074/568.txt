attack upon the front of the Fifteenth Army Corps, reaching around so as to engage two of the regiments in the First Brigade of this division. The enemy was handsomely repulsed at all points with great slaughter. Colonel George E. Bryant claims as a fair proportion of the killed and wounded in his front and the interval between his brigade and the Fifteenth Army Corps 250; 12 prisoners were taken. As soon as the attack was made I was ordered across Flint River, with the remainder of the division, and took position on the left of the First Brigade, where works were put up to cover the men.

On the afternoon of September 1 I recrossed Flint River with the division and moved around to the right of the Sixteenth Army Corps, and took the position occupied by General Kilpatrick's cavalry. Two brigades (Second and Third) were thrown across Flint River, where they intrenched. During the night the enemy evacuated their works, and fell back in the direction of Griffin. About 9 a. m. of September 2 the division started in pursuit, and found the enemy throwing up works in a strong position near the Atlanta and Macon Railroad. By direction of Major-General Howard I sent the Second Brigade (Lieutenant Colonel G. F. Wiles commanding) to hold a hill that had been taken by the skirmishers of the Sixteenth Army Corps.

This brigade moved forward under a heavy artillery fire, and secured a position about 400 yards from the enemy's line of works. As soon as bridges could be built across the swamps I sent up the First Michigan Battery* (six 3-inch Rodman guns), commanded by Lieutenant William Justin, which soon silenced the rebel battery, and by its splendid shooting prevented the enemy from completing his works until night. Shortly after occupying this hill with the Second Brigade I moved forward, with the First and Third Brigades, and occupied two other hills farther to the right, pushing the line of skirmishers to within 300 yards of the rebel works. After reconnoitering the ground I occupied a position, with the First and Third Brigades, about 400 yards from the enemy's main line, and secured it by a line of rifle-pits. The division remained in this position during the 3d, 4th, and 5th instant. The skirmishing was heavy and continuous, owing to the lines being so close. The losses in the division were large, being 5 killed and 40 wounded. On the night of the 5th instant the division was withdrawn, and moved back to Jonesborough, without molestation from the enemy.

On September 7 moved to a position near Morrow's Mill, and on the 8th camped near East Point.

I cannot speak in too high terms of the officers and men under my command. Their coolness under fire, the patience with which they have withstood the hardships and fatigues of the campaign, deserve the highest praise, and show a higher state of discipline than is generally found in a volunteer army.

Especial mention is due to my brigade commanders--Colonel George E. Bryant, Twelfth Wisconsin, commanding First Brigade; Lieutenant Colonel G. F. Wiles, Seventy-eighth Ohio Veteran Volunteers, commanding Second Brigade, and Colonel A. G. Malloy, Seventeenth Wisconsin Volunteers, commanding Third Brigade-for their untiring energy and the promptness with which all orders were executed.

Although the division has not been engaged in any general battles since I was assigned to the command, yet it has been constantly engaged in skirmishing, and has been well pushed up to the enemy's lines, and my warmest thanks are due to the members of my staff--
