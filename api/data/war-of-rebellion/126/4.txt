ALL DEPT. COMMANDERS AND CHIEF MUSTERING OFFICERS:

All soldiers patients in hospitals (except veteran volunteers, veterans of the First Army Corps, Major-General Hancock's, and soldiers of the Regular Army) will, as soon as they shall cease to require medical treatment, be at once mustered out of service in the usual manner. Should the commissary of musters and his assistant be insufficient to perform this duty promptly, you are authorized to appoint such additional assistants as you may consider necessary, and to avail yourself of such mustering officers within the geographical limits of your command as, in the judgment of the chief mustering officer, can be spared from their present duties. The commissary of musters must take especial pains to see that the commanding officers of the regiments and chief mustering officers of the States to which the soldiers belong are each furnished with a copy of the muster-our roll. An extra copy may be made for this purpose, if necessary. Soldiers whose claims for pensions are entitled to consideration should be discharged on the usual surgeon's certificate of disability. Soldiers absent on furlough from hospitals will be notified by the surgeon in charge to report to the nearest chief mustering officer for muster out,
