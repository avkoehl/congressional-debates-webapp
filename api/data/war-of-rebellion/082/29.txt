HEADQUARTERS EIGHTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 5, 1864.

General STANNARD,

First Division:

GENERAL: I was in error this morning when I said to your staff officer the brigade you have in reserve was encamped in the place spoken of in my note of this a.m. The major-general commanding directs that they encamp, in the woods near the Beasley house, which is the place he intended them moved to. Please see that the change is made.

I am, general, very respectfully,

Captain G. H. JOHNSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: Major Gates reports that he returned from his expedition to South Quay on yesterday. He found a force of about sixty men there, who fled to the woods on his approach. Some men were sent across the river and destroyed $20,000 worth of commissary stores, cotton, &amp;c. The boat at South Quay was also destroyed. He brought away with him four mules with harness and wagon. On account of the breaking of an axle of one of the guns he did not go to Franklin. He has been ordered to turn in to the quartermaster's department the property captured.
