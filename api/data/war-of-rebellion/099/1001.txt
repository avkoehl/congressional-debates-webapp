not been disturbed or rebuilt. The picket was from an Illinois regiment in Dustin's brigade, Ward's division, Twentieth Army Corps, or, as they expressed, it First [Second] Brigade, Third Division, Twentieth Corps. I inferred from all I saw, and all I could glean from the conversations of officers and men, that there was certainly one brigade, and probably two brigades, of infantry on this bank of Savannah River. There was nothing to show that cavalry had at any time been on this bank. I think they have the position at Cheves' house fortified. Captain Audenried said that General Sherman was anxious to commence sending out the citizens Monday (to-morrow) or at a very early day. I inclose herewith receipt of Captain Audenried for the sterling exchange sent Mrs. Cheves.

I have the honor to be, lieutenant, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General W. J. HARDEE,

Charleston, S. C.:

Have you cavalry around Savannah to prevent the enemy from foraging on the surrounding country? If so, have you a good commander for it? If not, do circumstances permit you to employ a small but adequate force for that purpose?

MONTGOMERY, January 9, 1865.

General S. COOPER:

Supposing General Hill reported for general assignment, he was ordered dto report to General Hood, who has lost many general officers killed, wounded, or captured. General Hill is now here. Shall he return to Charleston?
