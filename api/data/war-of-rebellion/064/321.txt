MAJOR: Two men, one a mulatto, captured on board the Emma, have just escaped from the rebel lines on the other side of the Atchafalaya. They state that General Major left the Atchafalaya on Thursday with a small party of three regiments, who crossed the Red River to see if they could find a place north of that where he could come in on the river and interrupt navigation. The rest of the enemy's forces they report very much the same as heretofore reported by me.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
