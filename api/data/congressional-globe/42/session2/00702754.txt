Mr. RANDALL. My friend from Michigan
[Mr. Stoitouion] wishes some explanation.
I am acquainted with this case, and perhaps
can state what will satisfy the gentleman. The

war, and died leaving two minor children.
The lady remarried, which, under the law,
would stop the pension. This bill continues
the pension in favor of the minor children.
