Mr. CLA Y rose to suggest a day for the cod$ de-

prorosition was made it. that branth of t¡>e Legis-
lature v hich was comparatively small when com-
pared with the numbei of members con-posing the
oihtr House, and which could p- pa e l'oeif at any

Ihe reasons which he had slated, could not see the
the sbghte t advantage or VMilily m the movement,
and therefore moved to lay the resolu ion on the
table, but withdrew Ihe mooon at the sugges'ion of
IVr HENDERSON, who remarked that he
hoped that the Senate would fix upon an ear') day
for au adjournment; for, after the termina ion of
the ex ia session, he merely had time to leich

The Senate tren took up the reso'u' on s 'brnit-
Itd oy ft Mj-hricK a few day-, ago, prop ) 11?
the ad jpt on as a joint rule that no arne dmett
wh'ch n/olved an approDriation rot ca ed fo  by
pre ex sti ig laws, should be made in either House
to the appropriation bills.
Mr SMITH of Indiana doubted the propriety
of such a res ktion, if, however it were so modi-
fied as to provide that no amendment which pro-
posed to appropnatt ironey should be moved by
any individual, unless the amendment had under-
gone the investigation of a committee, it would
have abetter effect, but die shape m which the re-
solution was now presented, prevented any amend-
ment whatever to be made to appropriation biltsby
the Senate.
Mr. KING tendered his thanks to the Senator
from Maryland for introducing the resolution.
Every Senator knew that whenever appropriation
b I!  came up, they were overloaded with amend-
ment after amendment, to which Senators were
often obliged to assent, otherwise the bilK could
not pass bota Houses. It was aa evil which gen-
tlemen perceived at every session, and bil's wera
verv improperly thrust through in this way, some
of them giving large sums to members in the shape
of books He hoped that the Senator from India-
na would see the propriety of this resolution, and
let it pass, as it would disemoarrass appropriation
bills and confine Congress to the appropriations
made in pursuance of law.
Mr. MERRICK desired to remark to the Sena-
tor f cm Indiana, that be mi took his inteniion,
and he eeifd to uppose that if the rule should be
adopted, the Señale wou d be cut off from their
rigot of making amendments to appropriation
bills Now, theresolution expressly excluded only
such amendments to general appropriation bills as
were not called for by pre-existing laws, and the
general scope of appropriation bills was to appro-
priate for  h<it was provided by law, but this ru 8
«as to prevent the introduction of objects not at all
germam.
Mi. CLAY was in favor of the resolution, but,
a  it can e on the Senate somewhat by surprise, he
would nove t'.at it be printed and laid on ihe ta-
1 tie, so hat Senit<-<-s might turn their attention to
its pnnc.ple , and at aiuture time adop1 this, or
strne o her resolution, with a view to accomplish so
desirable an object as was designated.
Mr. MERRICK acquiesced in the sugges'ton of
the Senator from Kentucky.
POsTPOf.E\IBNI OF THE BANKRUPT LAW
Mr BSNfONsaid tnat he was anxious to as-
een un t e sen e of ihe Senate on me bill   to   post-
p re 1 >r op"'  tn 1 of tne  Bankrupt law  until  thp
1 t dav oí JuU, 1842, and   for   tiat   purpose   he
movtd tnat the aeh¿te now proceed 'o its constde-
ratio ¡
Mr CLAY    Agreed, ag'e^d
Mr. BENTON    All I a, ant is an expression or
the sense of the Serate
M..CLAY.   We had better take up ihe bill
and vote 011 it at orce
1      The bi'l was ttsen taken up and considered as in
i co.nm t te of the whole, and there being no motion
to amend, it was reported to t"e Senate, and
Tne question row being, "Snail thj bill be en-
grossed for a thrd reading?" the yeas and nays
v,ere denaaurvd and cdered
Mr RIVES b gsjed leave to say a word or twof
and remarked tun he had voted against the pas
sage of t.ie Bankrup bill, and he had al<o voted la
favor tt i's rep a!, and s nee then his mind had
not undergone the shgh est change. He felt a
deep s -apathy tor ihose whom the act was design-
ed to benett , out h  had not, after the most atten-
tive consideration, been ab't to bring hi!, mind to
the cone usion that it ought to be a law of the
land, ?"d he tboug^t it would not so continue But
he saw no soi t of necessity ¡n agitating the public
mind with regard lo the postponement of its
operat on—it coi Id do no possible good. He
might say, t erefore, that, whi'e his former con-
vic ions ematned uchatiged, and while he felt
bimsrlf at liberty to vote for a repeal of, or for an
ainend'nent to, the law, he could not vote for the
pttpo 11 on no-1 befo'c the Senate, as it involved
t^e irteres s of a 1 utrerous portion of the commu-
nity He would repeat, that, while he was ready
to vote for a r°peal, he could not consent to agitate
the pubiiv mind upon this question
The question was then taken and decided m the
negative—yeas 18, nays 23, as follows-
