All arrangements in reference to the construction of new works, their armament, and opening fire, &amp;c., will be promptly communicated by the proper officer to the director of the siege as soon as determined upon.

Hon. E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War:

Nothing of interest during the night. No firing on our right, where the work proceeded undisturbed. On the left the enemy fired a good deal, but hurt no one, nor was the work interrupted. Have just sent a heavy field battery to silence a gun or two of the enemy that have been impertinent this morning, but have hurt no one.

Weather has improved and we are making good progress.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.
