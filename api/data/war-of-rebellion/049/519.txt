Commanding Officer Sixth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to say that the attack is suspended for to-day, and as soon as it becomes dark you will withdraw the troops to their former position, or in that vicinity. The object of waiting until dark to withdraw is merely to conceal the movement from the observation of the enemy.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
