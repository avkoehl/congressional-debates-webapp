OXFORD, MISS., December 19, 1862.

Colonel MIZNER, Vater Valley:

I want you to take all of the available cavalry, including the Sixth Illinois, but excluding that just returned with Colonel Dickney, and take the most direct route to Rocky Ford. When you get on Jackson's trail follow him until he is caught or dispersed. jackson must be prevented from getting to the railroad in our rear if possible. I have ordered Colonel Grierson to meet you with his command.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

WATER VALLEY, December 19, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

The Seventh Kansas, Fourth Illinois, and Third Michigan Cavalry Regiments are here; much of it is out scouting, &amp;c. Probably a force of 1,200 in all could go. The Sixth Illinois, I have just learned, is with General Denver. Why it has not reported to me i do not know. If Jackson passed Pontotoc yesterday he is not less than 70 miles from here know. It is 50 miles from here to Pontotoc. Jackson's force that left Grenada was reported to be 7,000; probably, however, not half that number, or perhaps seven regiments. Nearly the whole of the Third Michigan Cavalry is out, but I will collect all I can to-night if you desire me to do so.

J. K. MIZNER,

Commanding.

OXFORD, MISS., December 19, 1862.

Colonel MIZNER, Water Valley:

Send orders to the Sixth Illinois Cavalry to report to you at once. Collect all the forces possible and proceed without delay as per order.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

OXFORD, MISS., December 19, 1862.

Colonel R. C. MURPHY, Holly Springs, Miss.:

Jackson is moving north with a large force of cavalry; will probably be at Rocky Ford to-night. Send out all the cavalry you can to watch their movements. I am sending cavalry from the front to follow Jackson. Let the Second join them in the pursuit.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

OXFORD, MISS., December 19, 1862.

Commanding Officers at Holly Springs, Davis' Mill, Grand Junction, La Grange, and Bolivar:

Jackson's cavalry has gone north with the intention, probably, of striking the railroad north of this place and cutting off our communication. Keep a sharp lookout and defend the road, if attacked, at all hazards.

A heavy cavalry force will be in pursuing of him from here.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
