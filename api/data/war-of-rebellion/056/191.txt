LOOKOUT VALLEY, November 19, 1863.

Brig. Gen. J. A. RAWLINS:

It is now so foggy that I could see nothing should I go over the river. I propose, therefore, to wait until it is clearer. Please so inform General Grant.

Brigadier-General GEARY,Commanding Division, Twelfth Corps:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding desires you to send a small party, sufficient to obtain the information, and not large enough to attract enemy's attention, up the valley toward the junction of the Trenton and Whiteside's road, to move along Lookout Creek, and ascertain the points where it is fordable nearest the junction above mentioned, and also all the points this way, with the approaches. Captain Hall, aide-de-camp, who bears this, will accompany the party. Let it be off sufficient strength for an escort for him.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
