COMMUNICATIONS FROM KOSSUTH
Mr. HAMLIN. The Committee on Printing,
to which was referred the^iotion to print a letter
of Louis Kossuth to the President of the Senate,
pro tem.f together with a copy of a communica-
tion addressed by him to the President of the Uni-
ted States, have directed me to report in favor of
printing the same.
Mr. BORLAND. Before the vote upon the
concurrence in that report is taken, I desire to
call the attention of the Senate to the subject. I,
as an individual Senator, am opposed to the print-
ing of these letters; and I simply desire to call the
in tne
'iT, ire
es, &e-
attention of the Senate to it, as Senators do not
usually give their attention to these reports unless
it is specially called to them. The motion is to
print matter which I think is not at all necessary for
the public interest. It is a subject upon which we
have already had so much priming and so much
talking here, that I think it is time, with all defer-
ence to the opinions of others, that it should be
disposed of finally, and not printed or talked about
any more. I understand the usual custom is to
submit a report for the concurrence or rejection of
the Senate when it comes from the committee.
The PRESIDENT. Generally speaking, it is
taken up as soon as the report is made. The
question, then, will be on concurring in the report
of the committee.
Mr. BADGER. I really hope the Senate will
not concur in the report. I was in hopes that we
had got rid of this subject after the military ap-
pearance which M. Kossuth made in this Hall
some time ago, and that he would not be presented
here again, in his literary character. I move to
lay the report on the table.
Mr. HAMLIN. I hope the Senator will with-
draw that motion for a short time.
Mr. BADGER. Certainly, if the Senator will
renew it.
Mr. HAMLIN. I will renew it if the Senator
will authorize me to withdraw it should any other
Senator, for the purpose of making any remarks,
desire me to do so.
Mr. BADGER. I withdraw it unconditionally.
Mr. HAMLIN. I believe I have troubled the
Senate as little as any member, in relation to the
individual who has made this communication to
the Senate. I do not recollect that his name ever
passed my lips on this floor until this morning,
when I made that report. The communication is
at least from a very distinguished individual.
There are those in this body who desire that it
shall be preserved at length upon the records of
the Senate. It comes within no rule which has
been laid down by the Printing Committee, or by
the Senate, in relation to printing; but it is a
question which stands outside of all those rules.
Taking, then, the character of the individual, and
the disposition of many Senators to spread it upon
the Journal, and there preserve it, a majority of
your committee were in favor of printing it. I
will consume no more time in talking upon the
subject.
The PRESIDENT. It will not go on the Jour-
nal if it is ordered to be printed.
Mr. HAMLIN. Not at length.
Mr. BADGER. I renew the motion to lay the
report upon the table.
Mr. CHASE asked for the yeas and nays upon
the motion; and they were ordered; and being
taken, resultedâyeas 16, nays 24; as follows:
YEASâMessrs. Badger, Bell, Borland. Butler, Clarke,
Clemens, Dawson, Jones ot'Tennessee, King, Miller, Mor-
ton. Pratt, Rusk, Spruance, Underwood, and Upliamâ16.
NAYSâMessrs. Atchison, Bright, Brodbead. Cass,
Chase, Davis. Dodge of Wisconsin, Dodge of Iowa, Doug-
las, Downs, Felcli, Fish, (Jeyer, Gwin, Hamlin, Jones of
rowa, McRae, Norris, Seward, Smith, Soule, Stockton,
Sumner, and Wadeâ94.
So the motion to lay the report on the table was
not agreed to.
The PRESIDENT. The question now comes
up on the printing of the communication on the
report of the Committee on Printing.
Mr. CHASE asked for the yeas and nays upon
it.
Mr. BORLAND. Before the vote is taken, I
have one remark to make in opposition to the
proposition to print. I wish to call the attention
of the Senate to the fact, that these letters have al-
ready been printed by the Senate; that they are
printed now in the two newspapers which pub-
lish the official record of our proceedings here,
and that the whole proceeding appears upon the
Journal. By being published in the official report
of our proceedings, those letters have as much
publicity given to them as, I think, any reason-
able man can require. This is a proposition to
print these communications in pamphlet form, and
make them one of our regular documents. To
that I am opposed. It will incur but a small ex-
pense, it is true, but it will be giving an import-
ance to the matter to which it is not entitled.
Mr. BADGER. I would suggest to my friend
who is at the head of the Printing Committee,
[Mr. Borland,] that to give publicity to the com-
munication is not at all the object of this printing.
