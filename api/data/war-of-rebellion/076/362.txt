HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Before Atlanta, Ga., August 4, 1864--9 p. m.

Brigadier General M. S. HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: General Palmer is ordered to press forward onto the Sandtown road in the morning; and the programme of to-day in substance is still to be pursued during the morning. Until Palmer's movements enable Cox to work from your right we will direct our attention to your left. It occurs to me that your reserve brigade can work forward and get to the low ridge in front of your left and near the hill occupied by the rebel artillery, and I think it not improbable that we may be able to gain that hill. At all events, we will shorten the line across to Howard, and make a strong diversion in favor of operations to the right. Study the matter and see what can be done. We ought to begin pretty early in the morning.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel ISRAEL GARRARD,

Commanding Seventh Ohio Cavalry:

COLONEL: Your dispatch of to-day (dated yesterday, the 3rd instant) has been received and read by the major-general commanding, who directs me to inform you that to-morrow (the 5th instant) General Howard will send over a regiment of mounted infantry to co-operate with you on your right. The commanding general desires you, with this regiment, to guard all the fords and bridges of Utoy Creek below the point where General King's brigade crossed, and prevent enemy's crossing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

General HOWARD:

General Thomas is willing to give General Kimball, but says General Hazen is so identified with the Fourth Corps that he cannot spare him.

General HOWARD:

Order more and better bridges over Proctor's Creek. There should be two good ones where there is now one, and another opposite Davis' hill, where the old mill was.

Major-General, Commanding.
