I do not rely, but the fact of his brigade being in our front shows that all of Heth's is not in your front. Some prisoners taken this p. m. by Parke's people say the attack on your right flank was made by three brigades, one of Mahone's and two of Hoke's division. I think you have in your front nearly all of Heth's, three brigades of Mahone's and two of Hoke's, probably a division and a half, say 10,000 men. Could you not attack them to-morrow with all your forcer before they are re-enforced from the north of the James? I think if your men are in good spirits it will be your best chance, but I only make the suggestion.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864. (Received 12.15 a. m. 20th.)

Major-General MEADE:

We are prepared with the supports you have given us of the Ninth Corps to try to hold our own. We have lost in numbers but not in morale. The same number of our troops could not be better situated to show their strength than we are now, and it would be more satisfactory to me to have Mott's division retained with Parke than to have it here. If we are not strong enough to beat the enemy direction and will govern my movement according to the developments under you sanction where it is practicable.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH CORPS,August 19, 1864 - 2 p. m.

Major-General WARREN:

General Potter is now moving to join you with a portion of the Second Division. The other brigade will follow as soon as relieved. He will have, all told, about 2,400 infantry. He has been instructed to report to you. General Willcox left this a. m. to report to you. I presume he has joined you ere this. General While will follow soon.

JNO. G. PARKE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 19, 1864 - 10.30 p. m.

General PARKE:

I wish you would give directions to those regiments of General Bragg's brigade to join us the first thing in the morning, following the telegraph line. I have made my arrangements to fight at daybreak if the enemy chooses; and if not, we will re-establish the line and put your corps on it. Your corps fought bravely to-day.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
