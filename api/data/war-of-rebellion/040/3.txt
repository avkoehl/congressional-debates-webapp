HEADQUARTERS DEFENSES OF WASHINGTON,Washington, D. C. January 26, 1863.

General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington:

GENERAL: There does not appear to be much connection between the Army of the Potomac and the troops for the defense of Washington. Scarcely an order issued from the headquarters of the Army of the Potomac applies here. On the contrary, the commander acts under order from the General-in-Chief or from the War Department. The duties being so different, cannot the defenses be made into a separate department,
