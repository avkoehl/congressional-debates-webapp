vordor two in íeply He would like to know, since the Sena
♦or said hands off to thf1 General Government what ww done
at Sullivan s island, at the «nuance of the harbor of Charles
ton Had there been no appropriation asked for or gjratju i
tuerei Asd have you nohghohouaes there and near by? Aim,
he would ask, have you a right to make a Hght house for *
harbor entrance, and no right to make a harbpr, equally neces-
sary for the safety of navigation?
Let us alone, was the wish of the Senator Had South Caro-
lina withdrawn from the Unioni Had she seceded from it?
Had she separated from the other States of (he Umon, tfeatshe
wished to be let alonei He would ask, too what have you a
navy for, but to protect your commerce, but to enlarge it. aad
extend it to every sea* Have we in the West no commerce to
look after—nó commercial interests? What are thp Jakes
themselves but great inland seas'* and aie not harbors to be
made for them?
They weie not within the jurisdiction of any one State, or
even of the Union itself, and who should make harbors for
them if the General Government did nor do it? Was there,
he would ask,apawer m the Constitution to do ttws,andnot
a power to re2Jlate commerce? With respect to an economi
cal administration of Government, my friend from South Ca
rolina, said Mr C shall not go farther than I, and so in regard
to the revenues of the c mntry. He thought it disgraceful
that the finances of the Government should hem the condition
m which they now were Under such a state of things, appro
priations for these objects might not be politic or proper But
when revenue was provi 'ed harbors, breakwaters, and light
houses should be made If the let alone policy, however, ad
vocated by the Senator, was to prevail, nothing could bedone,
and I deny that therei* no common bon lof union intheeeob
jerts said Mr C or that they are not legitimately the proper
objects of our legislation The principles of the Senator from
South Carolina, carried out. would throw us back into th&
Confederation, and I am afraid we a^j^omg back to that point
ofoui colonia! history
Mr PRESTON said, among other things, m continuation of
the discussion, that the recurrence to first principles was the
great safety of 0111 institutions To erect works of the kind
named was in his opinion extra constitutional The residuary
power to do al I this was vested in the Stateb,and properly there
The power, m ht^judgment, was not vested m the General Go
vernment
The honorable Senator from Kentucky asks us if we are to
stami by and =* e these sufieiinesendmed—sufferings like those
dedicted in the tetate of Michigan by the memorialists whose
prayed had b-'en submitted lamwei, yes, said Mr P. We
ate to ->tand bv and see all the&e sufFeriii^s, sooner than violate
the Constitution of the United St ties If we could make bar
bort, we might make commercial riven and why not make a
housei it might be asited Light houses were but as lamp
posts on the avenue, and it misrht as well be inferred
that you could bud Gad~>byJs hot°l because there were
lampposts as to '■ay that y<u could budd harbors be
