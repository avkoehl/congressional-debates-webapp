HDQRS. SECOND DIV., TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,,Chattanooga, October 8, 1863.

Respectfully forwarded.

The paper marked C is a true copy. I received the order to move verbally from the general commanding the army and at once issued the order C. Before issuing order C I had sent an officer with General Negley's staff officer to point out Colonel Grose's position. I wished Grose brought off with the support of my other brigades, as he was then skirmishing with the enemy. I have referred to this matter in my report.

NASHVILLE, September 29, 1863.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I am at the end of my row. The North western Railroad will be in running order 28 miles by the end of this week if you will give me three other regiments of infantry; I have but one. I will find laborers to do the work by pressing all the inhabitants if necessary. I have no cavalry, but if you will give the three regiments asked I will make cavalry, but to press the road I must have guards enough to work all along it at the same time.

ALVAN C. GILLEM,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers.
