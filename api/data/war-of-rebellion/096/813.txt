CITY POINT, VA., March 3, 1865-2 p.m.

Major-General GIBBON:

If there are any army gun-boats that can accompany the expedition up the Rappahannock I want them to go with it. Some others should also go. Please communicate with Commodore Radford, and ask him to send two or more of his light-draft gun-boats with the expedition. There will be no objection to taking any that are now guarding roads leading to the river anywhere from Varina to Jamestown Island. The boatshe sends may start as soon as they can be got off to await the arrival of the troops in the Rappahannock.

U. S. GRANT,
