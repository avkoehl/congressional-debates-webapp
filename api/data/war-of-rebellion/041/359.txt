On the 4th instant the enemy sent in a flag of truce, proposing to give up such of our wounded as they had, not having the means to take care of them. I sent for and received 47. They refused to give up our wounded officers, among them Colonel Guppey, of the Twenty-third Wisconsin, a most gallant and meritorious officer. Though wounded, I am pleased to learn that his wound is not severe, and that all our prisoners were being well treated.

As to the force of the enemy engaged, opinions are conflicting, but, from the best data I have, I judge them to have been from 6,000 to 1,000, the whole under the command of Brigadier- General Green.

Respectfully, yours,

C. C. WASHBURN,

Major- General, Commanding.

Major WICKHAM HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant- General.
