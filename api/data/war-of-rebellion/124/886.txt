Horses are now being purchased on contract at Washington, Chicago, and Saint Louis, Mo. At other points-viz, Augusta, Me.; Boston, Mass.; New York City, Albany, Rochester, and Buffalo, N. Y.; Pittsburg, Pa.; Columbus, Ohio; Detroit, Mich.; Madison, Wis.; and Clarksburg, W. Va.-they are bought in open market, due public notice having been given in each case to all concerned.

The price of horses varies from $120 to $145 per head, being cheaper in the Western than in the Eastern States.

As an illustration of the benefit which will accrue to the Government in an economical point of view by the establishment of cavalry depots, I beg leave to state the following facts: After the battle of Gettysburg there were collected at and in the vicinity of Fredericksburg about 5,500 horses. Out of this number less than 2,000 are remaining alive, 1,000 of which have been returned to duty in the field. Of the 3,500 horses, the portion of this 5,500, which have since the 10th of July died, strayed, or been stolen, I venture to say enough might have been saved to the Government to have more than paid for the erection of stables at the cavalry depot at Giesborough Point, and which will accommodate 10,000 horses, sick and well.

The number of unserviceable cavalry horses on hand at and in the vicinity of Washington is upward of 16,000, the larger proportion of which can, with proper care and treatment, be again made fit for service in the field.

One great want felt by the cavalry service is the deficiency of veterinary talent in the country, and the impossibility of obtaining what little there is for the compensation now allowed by the Government.

The condition of the cavalry force throughough the country is reported upon, as a general thing, favorably.
