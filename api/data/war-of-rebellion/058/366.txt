LOUISVILLE, KY.,

February 11, 1864.

Major General U. S. GRANT:

We have shipped from this port and New Albany since the 1st of February 13,000 barrels of flour, 2,000,000 pounds of pork and bacon, 500,000 pounds of bread, 3,200 tons of hay, 34,000 bushels of corn, 50,000 bushels of oats, all independent of shipments by the Nashville railroad.

Three times this amount of grain is on the way from Saint Louis and ports below. We have called into service every boat within our reach, with the boats returning from Nashville, and such others as we may be able to procure. We hope to be able to transport 500,000 bushels of grain, and other stores in proportion, within the next ten days.

General Banks and General Sherman have taken from us thirty-seven first-class boats, with large amount of stores. Whatever is possible will be done.

ROBERT ALLEN,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: I have had the honor to receive your proposal to exchange 50 of our wounded soldiers now in your hands for a like number of yours which you suppose to be at Atlanta. We have but 41 wounded Federal soldiers at Atlanta, and their surgeon reports 14 of them unable to bear removal. I accept your proposed for the others with pleasure, the exchange, to be made at or near Graysville, and as soon after the arrival of the men who have been ordered to this place as may be convenient to you.

Most respectfully,
