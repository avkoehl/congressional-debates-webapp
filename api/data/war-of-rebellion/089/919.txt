Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have two prisoners-one belonging to Butler's and the other to W. H. F. Lee's division of cavalry. One of the prisoners says Hampton's whole force is here, save that left on picket. Hampton's command left Petersburg yesterday morning, when they first heard that the Fifth Corps had moved. Please inform me when my command will withdraw to the north side of the creek, that I may arrange about feeding, &amp;c. It will greatly facilitate my crossing if a double bridge is laid. Strong parties are at work on the railroad.

Yours, respectfully,
