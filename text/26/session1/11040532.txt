pelted to be connected with the banking systemi
What dictate, sir, of patriotism, or wudom, ie-
quires that the earnings of oar citizens, and the
finances of our Government, should be subject to the
control of a foreign power1? And yet it is the policy,
if not the object, of the Opposition, to brinst about
such a connection between bank and State, as
would leave the whole industry of our country at
the mercy of the English nation; in fact, would lay
the independence, and power, and wealth, of our
people, at the feet of the moneyed power abroad,
and the brokers and bankers hagued with it at
home.
I am aware, sir, that this injurious operation of
our currency is denied by the opponents of this
bill. But how is it regarded by those who reap
the rich harvest from it abroad? In their circular
of the 22d of November last, the Messrs. Baring,
Brothers, and Co. express their conviction that, by
investments in our State stocks, "England emplojrs
her annual surplus of capital both safely and pro-
fitably, and encourages her best customer," alluding
to our purchase of her manufactures. Now how
so, if such loans, which tend powerfully to expand
our currency, encourage, in a corresponding de-
gree, our own industry, and enable us to manufac-
ture proportionately cheaper? No, sir. If such
was the case, her investments would not then en-
courage the sale of her manufactures with us; we
should not, then, be the good customer represented.
This view of the subject i* also confirmed by the
admissions of i he bank agents who have visited
England for the sale of stocks. In a pamphlet
published in London, and said to be written by
James Duer, esq. of New York, is the following
argument addressed to the British capitalist:
"Thecapital borrowed by the United States is not so with-
drawn as to in erfere in any manner with the circulation, or
derange the currency of the country, [that is, Great Britain.]
It is used in payment of the debt that the United States, in the
course of trade, annually contracts. It is transferred by bills
from the banker w the merchant, and is taken to America,
not in bullion, but in British goods; every investment made,
while it adds to the income of the capitalist, swells the profit of
the manufacturer."
Not of the American but the; British manufactu-
rer, by increasing facilities for foreign remittances,
and thus inducing excessive importations.
But there is stronger proof than any mere decla-
rations of opinion, that an inflation of our currency
leads to excessive importations. Whoever will
compare the amount of onr bank circulation with
the amount of our imports, cannot fa:l of seeing the
intimate connection between the two—how they
mutually act and react upon each oiher. Every
great expansion of our currency has been accom-
panied by excessive importations; and unlets the
balance due has been invested in some of our
stocks, caused a demand upon the banks for
;peci', and a consequent contraction and prostra-
tion of business. Look at a few facts:
Year.      Bank circulation.         Imports.                 Exports.
1816    $110,000,000   $147,103,000   $81,920,452
.1817        69,000,000       99,250,000     87,671,569
1818         74,000,000     121,750,000     93,281,133
1819         62,000,000       87,125,000     70,142,521
1820         44,863,344       74 450,000     69,691,669
The effect of our bank circulation upon our im-
portations is here most clearly manifest.   In 1816,
when oar currency was more inflated than at any
other period since the Revolution, as a natural con-
sequence,our imports are seen to have increased from
113,000,000 in 1815 to 147,000,000 in 1816, while
our exports amounted to   less than 82,000,000.
This was followed by a contraction of the circula-
tion to 60,000,000, and of imports to 99,000,000.
But the excessive issues of the United States Bank
during 1817 increased the circulation to 74,000,000,
and the imports from 99 in 1817 to 121 000,000 in
1818—«showing an excess of over 28,000,000 of
imports, which caused a demand for spec e, a re-
duction  of   circulation   to 44,000,000   in 1820,
and general embarrassment and distress through-
out the country.
Mr. Crawford, in speaking of this period, says:
"As there is no recorded example in the history of nations
of the reduction of currency so rapid, so but few examples
have occurred of distress so general."
This took place under the regulation of a United
Sutes Bank. Take, as another illustration, an ex-
pansion of a more recent date:
Year.     Bank circulation.         Imports.              Exports.
1832     $59,000,000   $101,029,266     $87,176,943
1833        65,500,000 108,118,311 90,140,433
1334      94,839,570     126,521,332      104,336,973
1835     103,692,495     149,895,742      121,693,577
1836     140,301,038     189,980 035      128,663,040
1837      149,185,890     140,989,217      117,419.376
1838      116,138,910     113,717,404      108,486.616
1839      135.170,995     157,609,560      118,359,004
From 1832 to 1834, the bank circulation is here
seen to have increased from fifty-nine to ninety-
four millions, accompanied by an increase of im-
ports from one hundred and one to one hundred
and twenty-six millions, and an increase of ex-
ports lrom eighty-seven to only one hundred and
four millions. This left a large balance against
us, but instead of being followed according to the
laws of trade, by a demand of specie for exporta-
tion to pay the debt, the sale of State stocks
abroad, through the facilities afforded by the Uniied
States Bank, caused an excess of specie importa-
tions. This produced an additional inflation—an
increase, from 1834 to 1836, of forty-eight per
cent, in the circulation, of fifty per cent, in the im-
ports, and only twenty-four in the exports; show-
ing how powerfully excessive issues stimulate ex-
cessive importations, and that one,.if not the most
efficient, way to prevent them, is to give more sta-
bility to our currency.
Iu 1837, the imports are seen to have fallen off,
though there was an increase of circulation. This
arose from the suspension of specie payments, and
the consequent difficulty in making the proper re-
mittances. But upon the resumption of specie
payments ihe next year, the difficulty was removed,
and the imports are seen to have again rose with
the circulation.
It is this undue inflation of our currency, which
has rendered competition with other nations so dit-
ficult, and so often prostrated our manufacturers
It lias periodically glutted our markets with foreign
fabrics, paralyzed the arm of American industry,
and entailed upon the country a foreign debt of
near two hundred millions, to be wrung from the
hard earnings of industry, in addition to the hun-
dreds of millions of which the laboring communi-
ty have already been robbed through the same un-
righteous operation of an expanding and contract-
ing currency. It yearly exacts a tribute from our
people, for foreign nations, amounting to a sum,
which, if imposed in the form of direct tax, would
fire every patriot soul in the land, and raise a cry
of oppression that would resound throughout the
civilized world. But being in the form of an indi-
rect tax, the burden is not only patiently borne,
but the very system which imposes it lauded to the
skies.
But we have been directed to look to England
for illustrations, and to contrast her situation with
that of France. Let us, sir, institu te a comparison,
and see if the condition of the English laborer
will justify the assumptions of the paper currency
advocates; let us see whether the French laborer
should desire a more exclusive paper currency,
however much it may be des,red by ministers or
other classes.
The currency of Great Britain is estimated at
¿70,000,000 or $340,000,000; of which ¿34,000,000
is specie.
The currency of France is estimated at ¿120,-
000,000, or $580 000,000 in specie. The paper in
1837, was only $50,000,000, but is supposed to be
rather more now. The Bank of France is allowed
to issue no notes under 500 francs, equal to about
$93 00, and the Bank of Havre none under 250
francs.
Now what is the effect of these two currencies
upon prices? The difference between these two
countries is not wholly owic¿ to the State of the
currency; but this, nevertheless, bascan important
influence.
According to the Foreign Quarterly Review, an
English laborer's daily wages may be averaged at
nine shillings a week; while a Frenchman's do not
usually exceed six shillings—one-third less. But
the same authority says the average price of wheat
in England is 8s. 6d the bushel; while in Paris it is
only five shillings—that is as 17 to 10. Conse-
quently an Epgli&a laborer can purchase a bushel
of wheat with a week's work and have a six pence
left; while the French laborer can purchase a bush-
el of wheat with a week's work and have a shil-
ling left. Now, if we look only at the nominal
prices, the advantage will appear altogether in fa-
vor of the English laborer; but if we look at the
real prices—at what the wages in each country
will command—the better test—the advantage in
favor of the French laborer is seen to be no less
than fifty per cent.
That the rewards of labor and the condition of
laborers are both greatly depressed in France, can-
not be denied. But this, sir, is not for the want of
a more exclusive paper currency. If this is all
that is wanting to render the laborer happy, pros-
perous, and elevated, the task of the philanthro-
pist is indeed an easy one. The down trodden
millions of humanity might then rise at once from
their degradation of ages in all the glory of inde-
pendent and happy freemen, But has paper cur-
rency such potency? Do we find such elevating and
life-giving influence in all paper moneyed coun-
tries?
In Sweden, which by the way is held up by an
honorable Senator [Mr. Davis] as a warning
against a hard money currency, according to Storch,
bills of the nominal value of nineteen cents are is-
sued, and the "daily wages of a skilled agricultural-
ist are 7d. or 8d.; while the unskilled obtain no
more than 3d. or 4d. and board themselves. Their
food consists of hard bread, dried fish, and gruel
without meat."
In Austria, where bills of about three dollars'
value are issued, the mass of laborers have not yet
fully ob:aired their freedom, but are compelled to
work fi r the proprietors of the soil during every
day of the week excepting Sunday.
In Russia, where paper of the value of about
twenty cents circulates, the laborers are serfs or
slaves.
In Denmark, where notes of the value of about
eight cents are issued, the peasantry are also held
in bondage, and bought and sold together with the
land on which they labor.
If a paper currency is as identical with the well
being of the laborer—is as essential to his eleva-
tion, as represented, why this degradation of labo-
rers in paper moneyed countries? Why are the
laborers of Russia grovelling in the bonds of igno-
rance and servitude? Why are those of Denmark
bought and sold like beasts of burden? Why are
those of Sweden stinted to a sum varying only
from 3d. to 8d. per day? Why are agricultural
wages, under the paper currency of Ireland, from
whence have emigrated so many true friends of
freedom, as low as Is. to a 6d. a dav, while they
vary from $1 50 to $3 per day in Cuba, with its
hard money currency?
No sir, it is not for the want of a more exclu-
sive paper currency, that the laborer of France is
no better off, but for the want of a better Govern-
ment—of more freedom.   He is now surrounded
with restrictions.    He is not free to labor how and
where he will.   Without a patent from Govern-
ment, he cannot follow a trade, or carry his goods
I from  province to province.   Government deter-
I mines how many bakers, how many butchers, how
! many printers there shall be.   It comes in contact
I with individual enterprise, and cramps the indus-
try of the country by arbitrary and unequal laws.
But with all the superior freedom of the English
i nation, what is the condition rf her laboring popu-
lation?   No small portion, sir,  without fault of
their own, are doomed, from early childhood to
i premature old age, to unremitting toil, to gain the
I barest subsistence, to keep body and soul together.
Í The lowest class of laborers, according to McCul-
loch, eat meat only once a week, and the most nu-
merous class oaly two or three times a week. Con-
sidered as a whole, the  London Quarterly Review
says: "The English pauper is better fed  than the
independent laborer; the suspected thief receives
considerably mora food than the pauper; the con-
victed thief receives still more; and th  transponed
felon receives every day   nearly three times as
maoh food as the honest peasant."
It is true, sir, that a greater portion of the labor-
ers of France are deprived of the use of animal
food; bat does it follow that a* a whole they are
