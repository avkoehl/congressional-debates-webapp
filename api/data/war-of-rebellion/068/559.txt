Hon. GIDEON WELLES,

Secretary of the Navy:

I have just seen General Butler, who informed me that there was no military necessity for the naval vessels to go up to North Reach, as the height of the land there was such that they could render him no assistance, and that the occupation by the navy off Curl's Neck Reach will afford the army all the protection that it requires, from which my communications can easily be kept open.

At 10 o'clock on the 6th instant this force left very suddenly for Kinston. Our cavalry followed them to Pollocksville,
