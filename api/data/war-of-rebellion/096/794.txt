ONE MILE BEYOND WAYNESBOROUGH, TOWARD THE GAP, March 2, 1865.

[General MERRITT:]

GENERAL: Early, with four brigades of infantry and one battery of artillery, was posted behind entrenchments at Waynesborough. After an engagement of three hours I succeeded in placing three regiments in Early's rear, and completely routed him, capturing 3 pieces of artillery, 3 battle-flags, a large train of wagons and ambulances, and over 400 prisoners; also a portion of Early's staff. I am in hopes of catching Early; I am pushing him through the gap. My loss is slight.

Very respectfully,

G. A. CUSTER,

Brevet Major-General.

Another handsome battle-flag is just captured.
