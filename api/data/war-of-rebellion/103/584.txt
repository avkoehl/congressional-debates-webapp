Colonel CHRISTENSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Respectfully forwarded.

Large camp fires have been observed for a few nights past near the Spanish Batteries on east side of Mobile Bay. The rebels are evidently getting alarmed about the Mobile and Montgomery Railroad.

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., January 26, 1865-9 a. m.

(Received 10 a. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

You may order Thomas to send A. J. Smith's command to Canby with all dispatch. I do not think, however, it will do for Thomas to strip himself of cavalry as close as he propose. If he will send one division of 3,000 or 4,000 it will be sufficient.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 26, 1865-11.30 a. m.

(Received 29th.)

Major-General THOMAS, Eastport:

General Grant directs that you send to General Canby A. J. Smith's command of about 18,000 men and 5,000 cavalry* with all possible dispatch. They will report at New Orleans, if they receive no orders while en route.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

General A. J. Smith's command, numbering about 18,000 men, with 5,000 cavalry have been ordered to New Orleans with all possible dispatch. Please provide transports and supplies. They will probably move on Mobile.
