HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE TENNESSEE,

Nashville, Tenn., July 12, 1865.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

I have the honor respectfully to recommend the appointment of Colonel O. H. La Grange, First Wisconsin Cavalry, as assistant adjutant-general of volunteers, with the rank of major, to the end that he may be retained in volunteer service (his regiment being among those soon to be mustered out) until the reorganization of the army is fully determined upon. Colonel La Grange has seen much of active field service as a regimental, brigade, and division commander, and in each and all of these positions has been distinguished for his courage and skill, both in leading and directing the assaults of the troops under his command against the enemy's works. He is a most faithful and intelligent officer, and there is none more worthy, gallant, or capable in the service, being considered by his superior commander as one of the most promising volunteer officers in the army. He has rendered valuable service in many of the contests with the enemy in this part of the country, and his capture of Fort Tyler (while acting under the orders of Brevet Major-General Wilson, in his cavalry operations in Mississippi, Alabama, and Georgia) will compare favorably with any feat performed by cavalry during the war. That his services may not be lost to the army, I make a special request for his appointment at assistant adjutant-general of volunteers, with the rank of major, and that he be ordered to report to Brevet Major-General Wilson for duty as assistant provost-marshal for the Macon District.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
