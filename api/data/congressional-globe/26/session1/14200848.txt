of South Carolina, moved to amend the seel ion which provided
payment for impressed horses, carts, <kc so as to include all
other property lost in the service He particularly called the
attention of the House to the cases of s'a\ cs used as drivers of
wagons, aa sailors, laborers, <Lc. impressed into the service, and
lost, captured, or destroyed by the enemy His motion was ne-
gatived by a large majority A similar motion was made by
Br. Forsyth, on the 24th of January, 1325, to amend the bill au-
thoring further payment to sufleiers during the war, and with
a similar result
In addition to all this, the Houie of Representatives repeated
It refused, upon the most pressing and urgent applications of
Fiancis Larche, to make compensation for his slave, impressed
inte the service at New Orleans, in the winter of 1814-' 15, and
killed in the service A report of the Committee of Claims in
this case may be found in the third volume of the Reports of
Committees, 1st Session, 21st Congress, No 401, in which nu-

slave*killed in the service are referred to
CONSENT OF THB PEOPLE OP THE DISTRICT
It ¡a, in the next place, said that Congress may not abolish
slavery here without the consent of the people ol this District.
This objection has received the sanction of my venerable friend
from Massachusetts, [Mr Adams,] in an address to the people
of the United States since the last session ol Congress, and de-
serves, for that reason, if for no other, to be well considered I
understand the venerable member to nave placed this objection
•n the ground that it n against the great leading principle of
our institutions—that of self-government—that the people
should be acted on by legislation without their consent I ad-
mit the correctness of the principle, but deny that it sustains
the objection It will not certainly be claimed that the consent
must, in all cases, be expressed There are very few now on
the stage who expressly assented to the Consutution when it
was adopted, yet nobody denies that we are all bound by it in
virtue of an assent, implied. And is not the assent of the peo-
ple of this District to our legislation impl ed, upon the same
principles} When the territory composing this District was a
part of Virginia and Maryland, the assent of its inhabitants to
that Constitution which authorizes Congress to exercise exclu-
sive legislation in all cases whatsoever was, in effect, given by
the adoption of that Consutution by Virginia and Maryland, and
the present inhabitants of the District are bound to submit to
that legislation upon precisely the same principle that obliges
any of the States to submit to any legislation of Congress con-
stitutionally exercised.
If this reasoning be correct, the assent of the people of this
District to the constitutional action of Congress is implied; and
to require that it be expressed asserts a principle which would
absolve the peopleof the whole country from all obligation to
obey the laws either of the States or of the nation
And here it should be borne in mind that the objection does
*' not apply solely to legislation for'he abJlmon of slavery, but
that, from its nature, it is applicable to all subjects of legislation
affecting the interests of the people ef the District; so that the
principle it involves strikes at the whole power of Congress
supposed to be conferred in the clause of the Cunsti'ulion we
have been considering
But let us see how the new principle contended for is to be
earned out. How is the new piece of umber to be put into the
building which has been so "fatly framed?"
there must, it is said, be an express assent of the people of
the District. How is that assent to be obtained! By what au-
thority! Shall meetings be called! How and by whom! And
when they are called, and come to act—upon what principle—
by virtue of what organic law shall the decision of the majority
bind the minority, or bind those who  do not choose to attend!
And, then, in whit form and under what circumstances is the
assent too* give ! alusuHc law which we may pass be sub-
mitted to the people in their assemblies for their sanction! Or
shall they meet beforehand, and give Congress power to exer
use legislation in certain cases or upon certain subjects, leav
ingte Congress the power to settle the details of its own action!
Congress has hitherto always proceeded on the ground that
its power to act was derived from the Constitution And when
the inquiry has arisen, what are we authorized to do! Wise
and learned men have gravely looked in o the Coostitution to
determine the question B it, under the new doctrine, the rase
is entirely changed, and our wise men must lay aside their spec
lacles, shut the book of the Constitution, and go about to in
quire, what powei do the people of this District think we have
a right lo exercise! Or what power are they disposed to grant
ust We'used to think we must inquire ol the Constitution to
know what we might do, especially as we were solemnly
sworn to support it, but now we must inquire of the people of
this District i Who ever heard of such a Government as this
would he if the doctrine I am comba ting should prevail' Sure-
ly I need say no more to prove—waateveiy body must see—that
it puts an end to ibe government of Congress over this District,
and abolishes the seventeenth clause of the eighth section of
the first article of the Consutution as completely as some of the
"men and women" of the North desire to see slavery and the
slave trade abolished
1MVLIED FAITH TO VIBQ1NIA AND MARYLAND
It isfurtherobjtcted to the exeiciseof our power of abolish-
ing slavery and the slave trade here, that it would be a viola-
tion of the "good faith to Virginia and Maryland, implied in the
cession and acceptance" by Congress to the territory which
forms this District
"Good faith implied i-> the cession and acceptance " What
does this mean! It n.^i mean this that there was something
in the cession and ac ^.ptance or m the circumstances con
nected with them, that raised a confidence in Virginia and
Maryland that the Government of the United States would not
abolish slavery or the slave trade in the District, this confi-
dence, irom whichever of these sourcesdenved carrying with it
a correspondíag pledge on the part of the United States that
such action should not take place.
Now it is manifest that there could have been no such pledge
implied, because therecould properly have been none such ex
pressed. Congress had no power to make such pledge It
would nave been utterly void, if made, because the Conslitu
don having given to Ci igress power to "exercise exclusive le-
gislation in all cases whatsoever" over the District, no one Con-
gress can, by any act, restrict a subsequent Congress to the exer-
cise of that power in some cases only, if it could, it would have
the power to alter the Constitution by act of legislation.
But, waiving this, let us look into the acts of cession and of
acceptance, and we whether any thing cau be found from which
the supposed confidence could be raised on or.e side, or the sup-
posed pledge implied on the other.
I he acts of cession, one dat d December 3, 1789, and the
other December 19, 1791 areas follows
"J3e it enacted by the General Assembly, That a tract of
country not exceeding ten miles square, oi any lesser quantity,
to be located within the limits of the ¡state, and in any part
thereof, as Congress may by law direct, shall be, and the same
is hereby, forever ceded and re inquired to the Congress and
Government of the United States, in full and abso'ute right, and
exclusive jurisdiction as well of soil as of persons residing, or
to reside, thereon, pursuant to the tenor and effect of the eighth
section of the first article of the Constitution of the Government
of the United States"
Such were the cessions "Full and absolute right and exclu-
sive jurisdiction of soil and persons residing or to reside there-
on " And that there should be no hesitancy on the pait of the
United States to accept the cessions, on account of any supposed
failure to make the grants they contained coextensive with the
grant of power to Congress in the Constitution, it was added,
'pursuant to the tenor and effect of the eighth section of the
first article of the Cons'itution of the United States "
The acts of Congrtss accepting these cessions are mere acts
of acceptance, containing nothing which has the slightest bear-
ing on the present question
Now, what is there in these cessions and their acceptance to
raise an expectation on one side, or imply a pledge on the
other, that the power to abolish slavery was to become a prac
tical excepuon from the "exclusive jurisdiction" expiessed
in the cessions, or from the authority to legislate "in all cases
whatsoever," given in the Constitution, to which they refer?
What sort of "good faith" is it which, in the face of so plain a
grant of all power, excepts, without any language expressing
or implying such exception, the important power now in ques
tionl Could not the ceding States have incorpoiated in their
acts a proviso that nothing herein contained shall be construed
to vest in the United States, or to recognise, in any manner,
the power to abolish slavery in the ceded territory! And shall
they, having failed to make, or attempt to make such stipula-
tion, now claim that it was implied "in the cessions and accep-
tance of the territory! This omission to except the case of the
abolition of slavery is the more significant because theie was,
in ihe e acts, a reservation really made, namely, "that nothing
herein contained shall be construed to vest in the Umted
Stales any right of property in the soil, or to effect the rights of
individuals therein, otherwise than the same shall or may be
transferred by such mdividuals,to the United States "
Now, why was there not connected with this reservation the
i stipulation I have suggested in favor of slavery! It could not
have been for want o caution in the Legislatures of Virginia
and Maryland, for there was a very extreme caution exercised
in making the reservation as lo the soil could—since it is
quite obvious that, without such reserva'ion, no property
of individuals in the soil have passed to the Uni.ed States.
Nor could the omiss on have been the eff-ct oian impres-
sion that the grant of power by the Constitution to Con-
gress was not full and complete, so as not to require an ex-
p c-,8 exception, if any was desired or intended, because the
subjectof the extent of the powers granted to Congress over the
District had then recently been discussed, as I have shown, in
the Virg ma Convention, where it had been maintained that
the power was "unlimited"—extending to ' every possible
case " Neither could the omission have resulted from a sup
position that, as the Consutution had granted te Congress pow-
er to legislate "in all cases whatsoever," it would be incompe
tent for Virginia and Maryland to make the stipulation that it
should not legislate in a particular case—since it had been ex-
pressly declared in the Virginia Convention by Mr Madison,
the father of the Consutution, "that the ceding States might set-
tle the terms of the cession," and "make what stipulation they
please m it " Nor could the omission to make the stipulation
nave resulted from an impression that it was unnecessary to
stipulate against the exercise of a power not within the compe-
tency oflegislation, since the competency of legislative power
to abolish slavery was then universally conceded
Whence, then, the very significant and important omission to
settle this question by a stipulation in the acts of cession! Theie
Can be but one answer to this questio , and that is, th it Vir-
ginia and Maryland did not intend to make such a stipulation,
they did no , in fact, desire to make it    The subject  of the
fiower of Congress, under the geneial grant of power to leg s-
ate in all cases whatsoever, did not escape the attention of the
leading men in those States They knew that by the cessions
they parted with alljunsjiction over the TerrUerj, that Con-
gress was made its exclusive Legislature, and that legislative
power was then relied on asa legitimate means for abolishing
slavery, and yet, with their eyes thus wide open, they ceded
the ten miles square, and expressly confirmed tke ample power
over it granted to Congress by the Constitution, without the
slightestattemptto impose any limitation whatever upon the
exercise of that power in the abolition of slavery
While the supposi ion of an "implied faith" to Virginia and
Maryland is thus clearly negatived by the terms of the ces-
sion , and the significant omission of any stipu'ationm them in
favor of slavery, there are other consideration  winch render
it manifest that no such limitation can be implied
What is the ground of the supposed "good lanh" to Virginia
and Maryland! It is the assumption that the abdiuoi of sla-
very and the slave trade here would injuriously effect the inte
rests of those S ates. But i« legislation on the subject of slave-
ry the only legislation which the punciple of this objection
would reach! l|i there, in fact, any legislation capable of ar-
fecting the interests of the neighboring States, to which it
might not be applied! Might it not, for example, reach the
criminal code which we might enact for the D sti icti or the U
censing of lotteries or gaming establisements in it! oroui legis-
lat on upon the subject of the cu rency here!
Dees not the principle of this objection strip ui of all power,
not only ovei the subject of slavery, tut over every other sub-
ject, or legislation on which might affect the feelings or the inte-
interests of Virginia and Maryland, and send us, cap in hand,
to those States, in the attitude of inquiring what we may do in
the execu ion of our powers of legislation! Who is willing to
take this attitude! Who dreamed, at the adoption of the Con-
stitution, that the Federal Government would ever be brought
to the necessity of taking it!
And, then, the same difficulty would exist in case the people
of the District should—as it is contended they must do—give
their«ssentto the action of Congres  abo ishing slavery, for the
abolition would be just as injurious to Virginia and Maryland,
lfeffsctedhyCooftesi with the consent of th« people of the
District, as without it Indeed, the principle of the objection
would be just as fatal to the right of the people themselves to
abolish slavery here, as the right of Congress to do it 'I he ob-
jection, in fact, places both Congress and the people in the same
position, in regard to abolition, as are the individual citizens
ol Virginia and Maryland It is one of the most unjust and op-
pressive features of their slave sys ems, (a feature which mark-
ed the cruel and sarguinary system of Spartan slavery ') that
individuals are prohibited from emancipating their slaves, ex-
cept upon condition of the banishment or~the emancipated;
though a dispensation may be, and sometimes is, granted by
special acts oflegislation
The cruel policy which compels the citizens of those S ate9
(where the rights ol conscience are carefully guarded in other
respects, but flagrantly violated in this') to hold their brethren
in bondage, against their strongest convictions of duly, and the
noblest impulses of a generous nature, is thus extended even to
the Government of the United States, so that, although under
a conviction of the claims of justice, it might desire to abolish
Blavery here, and thus cease to siand before the world in the
character of a slaveholding Government, itcou'dnotdo it with
out going, wi'h the slaveholders of Virginia and Maryland, to
the Legislaiares of those States for the enactment of dispensing
statutes <
Such is the humiliating position in which the slave power
seeks to place the Government of this Republic '
It being thus apparent that there is nothing in the "cessions
and acceptance" implying the "good faith" which is relied on,
and that such implication, carried out, would sublet Congress
to an absurd and degrading subserviency_to Virginia and Mary-
land, the question recurs, where shall we find this mysterious
"good faith " which is in every body's mouth, but which no
body can define, and nobody seems perfectly to understand?
Mr Speaker, there never was any such thing as the "im-
plied fdith" that is contended for It did not enter the concep
tions of either of the parties when the cessions were made and
accepted Virginia and Maryland now desue ti limit the ac
tion to Congi ess on the subject of slavery. Tney then de-
sired no such thing
If the ob|ection were placed on the ground of the present
wishes of Virginia and Maryland, then I say give them all the
effect to which the desires of those States are fairly entitled,
but, when they place in thehigh and imposing ground of a
breach of implied faith, my reply to them is, that there is not
and never was any such implied faith is they contend for;
that the change of their minds since 1789, does not change the
character of the enactment and acceptance ef the cessions, and
that they must, therefore, be content to abide by them accord
ing to their fair import.
Indeed, I go further, and say that the state of public sentiment
on the subjectof slavery at that period, and the universal ex-
pestation then entertained that slavery would, at no dis'ant day,
be abolished, not ou'y negative the idea of the implied faith con-
tended for, but (urnish the strongest ground for an opposite im-
plication I «hall presently, foramoie general purpo«e, pro-
duce such evidence of the public s-ntiment and expectation as
wi'l, I trust, satisfy the most incredulous that, ins ead of object-
ing to the action of Congress on the subject of slavery here, the
States ofVirginia and Maryland were bound in good faith, lonz
since, to have abolished slavery withm their own limits, and
that their ne2,ect to do so is ju'-tgr und of utmplaint on the
Íiaitof the United Sta'es la no part of the Union were there
ouder and more bitter denunciations against slavery than in
these same States of Virginia and Maryland when the Territory
was ceded and accepted It was not only universally admitted, as
I have shown, that the abolition of slavery was within lhe com-
petency of legislation, but that it must and would be effected, to
use Washington's language, "at no distant day " The ces-
sions of this Territory, therefore, it must be apparent to all,
were accepted by Congress with the expecta ion, well under-
stood by Virginia and Maryland, that ihe District aliout to set
apart for the seat of Government would soon ceas i to be sur
rounded by a slave population—a consideration which may
well be supposed to have had great influence in inducing the
decision of Congress to locate ti e seat ol Government here.
Instead^ therefore, of the present agitation of the subject of
slavery and the slave trade here being lusfly tobe regarded (to
use the language of Mr Van Buien to the North Camilla
Committee) ' as a surprise upon the people of Maryland and
Virginia," thesmrprise should be on 'he olher side, and, in-
stead of being confi lent (to use his language) that, if the stale
of things which now exuts had been apprehended by tho;e
States, the cession of the District wouid not have been made,"
n i man can consider the stale of feeling and expectation 11 re-
gard to slavery at that time, without being confident that,' if the
present state of things had been apprehended by" the Middle
and Northern States, "the cession.would not have been" ac-
cepted
Such being the true state of this case—such the "faith" re-
ally "implied' in the history and spmt of the times to which I
have referred, is it not amazing to witness what is now pissing!
Instead of the redemption of the implied pledge to remove
from around this seat of Government the cur«e of slaveiy, it
has been permitted greaily to increase, and this very city has
become the great slave martof large portions of these State —
insomuch that the Representative from the free States, and
theirconstituents who come to this city to witness the delibe-
rations of Congress, are compelled to witness the driving of
coffles of slaves through its principleavenues, and by the very
doors of this Capitol—to witness, in fact, the slave trade, with
ail its infernal machinery of prisons whips, chains, and slave
ships—a trade little less horrible—in some of its aspects mors
so—than that whose prosecution on the high seas our laws have
subjected to the punishment of death
And now, to crown the whole the very petitions—prayers of
citizens of the United States, asking, in the name of humanity,
the aboliUsn, not of slavery in Virginia and Maryland, but of
slavery and the slave trais here, are sneered at, and rejected
without a hearing, while the petitioners are branded as "des-
perate and despicable fanatics" on this floor
Mr Speaker, need I ask who has tlw right to complain of a
violation of "good fa th" in regard lo the matter of slavery
here!
IMFLISD PLEDSB OF THE NOKTH TO TUB SOUTH IN AOOPTIHO TSfll
CONSTITUTION
I come now to another branch of the subject of implied falto
of a moi e general nature, I mean the 'implied faith" that Con-
gress will not legislate on the subject of slavery here, and that
the people of the North will not agitate the subject—draws
from what is called 'the compromise which lies at the basu of
onr Federal compact,''
