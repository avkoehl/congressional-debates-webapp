HDQRS. DEFENSES OF BERMUDA HUNDRED, VA.,ARMY OF THE JAMES,

January 29, 1865.

Brigadier General J. W. TURNER,

Chief of Staff, Department of Virginia:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that the Twenty-third Regiment Illinois Volunteers, 187 strong, have reported to me this a. m. The company of the Thirteenth New Hampshire, 35 strong, having been taken away, and Company A, Second Pennsylvania Artillery, 139 strong, about to start for Fort Fisher, leaves me really no stronger than I was previous to this regiment reporting.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. FERRERO,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,January 29, 1865-6 p. m.

Brigadier General J. W. TURNER,

Chief of Staff:

Captain Stoops, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, has just returned from a reconnaissance to Riddell's Shop, returning by Malvern Hill and Strawberry Plains. He saw nothing, and the roads do not indicate any travel whatever. I have another scout out on the Charles City road toward White's Tavern, but I do not anticipate that it will bring any information. I propose to send Colonel Evans with his brigade out the Long Bridge road, to go as far as the Chickahominy and return, unless he should strike the trail of the enemy's troops moving east toward Williamsburg, in which case I will instruct him to follow them up.

Colonel Evans will move at daylight in the morning.

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier and Brevet Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,January 29, 1865-7.30 p. m.

Brigadier-General TURNER,

Chief of Staff:

Captain Paul, Fifth Pennsylvania, sent out by Colonel West, has returned. Colonel West reports that the captain went as far as White's Tavern and saw nothing. The enemy had a scout of about sixty men, mounted and dismounted, out on the Charles City road during the day, that returned. Captain Paul heard the usual sounds of camp music, chopping wood, singing, &amp;c., but no evidence of any movement. He remained near the Charles City road for three-quarters of an hour and then returned.

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier and Brevet Major-General.
