Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Army Corps:

GENERAL: If requested by General Butler or Smith to move up to where Smith now is do so. The enemy are now seen to be re-enforcing Petersburg by rail and by troops marching. So far, however, but two regiments and eleven car-loads have been reported. Your rations have gone up. Hope they have reached you by this time. General Butler says he understands you have halted at a creek short of the one (Harrison's Creek) to which you were to go.

Respectfully,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

Major-General HANCOCK:

General Smith has carried the outer line of works and the only defensive line of Petersburg. They are crowding down troops from Richmond. General Grand supposes that you will move out and aid General Smith. Please move up at once to the aid of Smith and put the Appomattox between you and Lee's army. This is important. I have already forwarded you the same suggestion by Major Ludlow. Provisions are on the way to you. More will be started during the night. I will see you supplied. I can send you if needed a couple of batteries of artillery.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
