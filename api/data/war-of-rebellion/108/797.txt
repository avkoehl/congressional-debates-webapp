with a little delay as practicable. I have informed the officer in command in the Valley of these movements. Colonel Willis is kept informed. I sent him a courier on yesterday, giving notice of the movements of the enemy up to the date of my dispatch. He was then near Liberty Mills. I also requested General Stuart to keep him promptly advised of all movements. Nothing from the Valley this morning. It is now 9 o'clock. General Hill said last night he would send General Walker's brigade, that being the most convenient.

Very respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DECEMBER 15, 1863.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL:

GENERAL: I think I had better go to the Valley at once, and another brigade had better be sent. Of course if things did not require it, I would return immediately. If we wait further developments it might be too late. I will be over very shortly.

J. A. EARLY,

Major-General.

STAUNTON, December 16, 1863-7.30 a. m.

Major W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I arrived here at 1 a. m. Imboden at the foot of North Mountain, six miles beyond Buffalo Gap. Averell reported crossing Warm Springs Mountain in the direction of Millborough. The force of Strasburg same as last reports represented, 1,800, but no indications of a movement in this direction. Fitz. Lee is here. Shenandoah too high to cross low down. It may be necessary to send Fitz. Lee to prevent an advance by Averell on Lexington or Fincastle. Stuart had perhaps better make a demonstration in favor of Rosser. At any rate, the gaps leading to the PAGE Valley had better be watched, to prevent Rosser being hemmed in on the east side of the Shenandoah. I shall leave in a few minutes for Buffalo Gap.

J. A. EARLY,

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully submitted for the information of Lieutenant-General Ewell. General Stuart has been requested to have the passages leading into PAGE Valley watched.

Respectfully,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
