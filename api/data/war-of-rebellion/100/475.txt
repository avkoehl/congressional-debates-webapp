HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SAVANNAH,Savannah, Ga., May 11, 1865.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the South:

General Gillmore's dispatch received. Molineux's brigade, made up to 2,500 strong, has left this morning, and will arrive at Augusta on the evening of the 17th. If the general has any further instructions that should go to General Washburn, please send them as soon as possible, in order that he may be sure to receive them in time. Are there any orders with regard to the disposition to be made of the bullion captured at Augusta? The tin-clad Savannah has not arrived yet.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the South:

The Jeff. Davis leaves here to-morrow morning for up river. She will probably go up as far as Poor Robin and connect there with the Amazon next Saturday night or Sunday morning at latest. We probably can make arrangements so as to get the boat through quicker, but possibly not. General Gillmore's staff officer can go on that boat and it will be his best way as far I can see now.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the South:

The Ogeechee cannot be navigated by steam-boats of any draft higher up than King's Bridge, which is but a short distance, on account of snags and fallen trees. If it is a military necessity to establish a depot at Millen, it will, without doubt, be necessary to repair the railroad to that place.
