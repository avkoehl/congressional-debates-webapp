Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that my lookouts convey the impression that the enemy has to a very great extent weakened their lines in our immediate front within the past three or four days. At about 4 p.m. a train of wagons was seen passing northward upon the Richmond road. Thirty-three were counted, when the rain closed in and shut out all further observation. Small squads of the enemy were employed at various points of their lines, increasing the strength of the works.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Captain and Chief Signal Officer.
