Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

I learn of no force between here and Port Hudson, nor of any Major Dimitry. The told force from Woodville, Miss., rounds, is estimated at 1,200 or 1,500. An escaped conscript from Greensburg to-day reports the Tenth [Eighteenth] Louisiana Battalion, under Colonel Carter, 350 strong, mostly conscripts, left there three days ago for Springfield, near Madisonville. He also reports General Powers' return.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff:

Colonel Fonda has been to Jackson to-day and captured 3 rebels. From his information and the statements of the prisoners the information you send me would seem to be incorrect. I do not think there are more than 500 rebel soldiers in this part of Louisiana at
