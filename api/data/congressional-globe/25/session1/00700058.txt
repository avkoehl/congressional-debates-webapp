as the one under discussion, he had no doubt, for
he held that o ie Le 'Ualipe had the power to re-
peal the acts of the pieced ng one, no mat c w lat
rights h?d been given under it, excep* i   i ght ot
property S > ie sent emen conterded that the
burp 's was a gift to the States Bu he contended
that theie vveie not tie shghtest grounds foi such
an assumption One gentleman hid sa d that the
States had acquire 1 a n,ht to it, as a matter of
eqmts "Why, ne rr ght is veil contend that an
individual to whom hid been loaned a sjrn of mo-
ney, had acquired a right to keep it, from tl at fact
Had the people in 1836 understood th" bill o be
otheiwise man a deposite act, it would never ha* e
passed? No member would have dare 5 to go home
to his const tuents, and tell them that he had voted
their money out of the Tieasury and given it to
tie people The people of Georgia would spum
the idea of receiv mg the money undei such cn-
cumstances He had no desne to contaminate his
fingers with a fund which h?d been drawn from the
people without any necessity
Mi rAlRHELD, of Mame addressed the
committee as fohovvs Mr Chanman, it i> with
gieat leluctmce that I e\ei use to say an) thing
upon this fit oi, and that leluctance is increased at
the piesent tunc, by the reflection that so many
gentlemen distinguisned foi their talents and elo-
quence have, piecededme m this debate But, sn,
I feel impelled by a sense of duty which I cannot
oveicomc, to piesent ni) views \eiy bi efly to the
committee, how evet fai I may fill bihmd other
gentlemen, eithci m the matter oj m the manner of
presenting it
The  gentleman   fiom   Noith  Carolina,   (Ml
Shcpard,)  who has just  given  us   a vtiy hand-
some speech upon   this   subject, commenced with
an eulogy upon the deposite act of 183G       Su, I

I piove, and gentlemen are rejoicing c er a jieimr-
« ml change m the politics of the State, let me say,
"lav not that fia tenng unctmi to your souls "
The election, if lost, has been lost bv a c< mbiiia-
tioa of peisonal and local questions and interests,
not involving the gict political questions of the
dav Maine is essentially democratic, and the
c'emociacv vul' }et rise m tne.ii stiensth, redeem
the State, and effectually throw off any odium th^t
may have been incmr>.d i'i the late contest Yes,
sir, "the star in the Last," though its lusti° may
now be dimmed, vill ¡ et slime foi th vutl lenewed
and increased effulgence
But to return to th pending quest oi , I ne d not
saj that he ng oppo ed to the ougmal act in its in-
ception, and in all ts subseque it st o-es; and pro
cesses I am of course in fav oi of the 1 ill now
prap King the postponement of the i av, ment uf the
fourth instalment But it is said by sev i"l gen
tlemen tint we cannot 1 iwfully withhold tms n
stalment That the States hai e acquired a tested
tight in it, by virtte of a conliact Sn I had
thought that the doctrine of vested i i<*hts had be-
come sufficiently odious through the mdiscieet us 
of it b) its fuends, without attempting to applv it
to this case The gentleman fiom Massachusetts
(Mr Bnghs) has lahoied to show that there is a
conliact between the ¡states and the Goveinment of
the United States and upon the establishment of
that point, seemed to consider the nght of the
States to the instalment as clearlv made out Now
sir, does one follow th" other' It appears to me
not If it be a contiact, the next inquny is, what
are lis terms, ai d is it a Tmíttlng and valid one'
<ind foi the purposes of this trguirent, it mav b<
addmitted to be a contiact All bailments aie con-
tacts This is one 1 md of bailment and, tnere
fore, a contract It fills within that chss oí h ul-
ments, technical!.) denommittd m the law ' de-
posite,' winch is the bailment ol a thing hj one
to another, to be letuined when the bailo: calls foi
it By this, the bailee icquues no right or title
m the thing hailed, oi to its use, but is bound
to restore it V, hen called foi
On the part of the United States this bailment of
money to the States wasmeiely gratuitous, and
theie was no ouch consideration m the cáseas to
render the contiact a legal and valid one But it
is said there w as a promise on the pai t of the States
to pay back the monev, and thi constituted agiod
consideiation ^n as well mirht I set up a legal
claim to mv ueighhi i s hoi e—ay, to a tested nght
i i h n because my nei^hhoi, m the exeicise of a
smut of courtesj and kindness said I might have
mr d e of his horse at anv time, on nj pionu e to
"ctmnhim Ptn the gentleman from New Yoik
(Mi Sihicv) has undertaken to show that theie
v a, a good consmeiation upon sti ct common law
pr aciples, and has quoted fiom the old bool s th
definition of a good consideration to be, " a chugt
or trouble to one partv, or a benefit to the other°"
both of which, he sajs, exist m this case The
Stan s, ,t is said inclined chafes and tiouble in
lcceiv mg an 1 keeping this mone\, and the Gene-
ral Government domed a benefit mhav.ng it kept
foi the n Sn, I mun confess I was not prepared
to heai such a po ilion as this tal en C m it m
any sense, bo said to be a ch irge oi tioub'e to a
Stitc lo íece ve a large sum oí monej, and use it
for an indefinite penod v ithi m payi g m erest foi
l? If so, I know of a gie I man) people who
would like to be houbled in the same wa) and I
cannot siy that I snould have u.nv very senoub ob-
leetioi s o ítmysef Again how can it be -aid,

Goveinment vvithd-aws from the oanl s, ¿mddepo-

the payment ofmleist And this the contienan
from New Yoik calls a benefit In the United Slates
Goiamnenti Sir, 1 cannot conceive ol a moie
palpable perversion of our mother tongue
But, to strengthen his nosition, that the charge oi
trouble mcurrxr oj the States cons ilutes a good
co oidetation, he gentleman from New Yo U íes
on to show how the Goverm lent of his Stale d. s-
posed of 'he monev af'ci it w as leeeived, ai d how
various expenses vveie mcuned S r, is this a le-
gitimate and pioper mode ol ci nstruing a c intiact,
or foi ascerta mng whether tnere be a leg„l eon i-
deiation or not upon which it i fou^dod' I think
not A connect, illegal or mi ah I at the time of
itj creation, cannot be purged of its illegal quali-
ties, and made v altd b) any thing w hich ma) sub-
sequently be done by eith r part)
The gentleman mini I\ew Yoik has "'«-o uiged
upon us, in an eloauent and forcibl0 m^nnei, the
moral obligation which it is said we ^re undei to
pav o/er this fourth instalment Up m tms point
however, 1 will not occupy the time of <he com-
mittee, as it ha0 been full) and abiy lepheci to h)
otheis At the best, foi (hose taking this giom d,
there mav be said to be conflict ng claim  upon the
same fund That of the Government, to can) on
its neeessar) functions and operations, and that ei
the States, as borrov ers v thout interest Wb c i
of thesp ehims is paramount, I will leave fir eaei
member to decide for himself, constituí i <? as he
does an important part of the Government it^eif
But again, in íclation to the coastmction oí ih s
lleged contract, it is said b the gentleman fiom
Massachusetts, (Mi Bnggs) and others, that tus
noney deposited with the States cannot be called
back, except in the mode prescribed m the prov iso
of the I3th section of tne deposite act, that is, m
sums not exceeding $30,000 per month If this
position be coriect then this law is not w hat its
title imports, a rfcjio ite law, but is,m fact, with ie
gard to some of the States, ju least, a dish ibuhon
In New York, foi instance, the amount thusdravvii
would amount to only about the le nl nteits on
the amount deposited Sothat in arrnt seventeen
Vears, the cUim of the United Sates vul1 have
become entirel) satisfied, while evei) dollar i f the
pimciple will remain untouched m the ha^ ds ol
that Stale Now, was this the intention of thos 
who enacted this law' No, sir Its friends repel-
led the charge that it was distubution m disgms 
and stienuously maintained, wmle the bill was
undeigoing discussion m this House, that it crea-
ted a deposite meiel) Such a'so is the title of the
bill But if the constiuction of the gentleman
from Massachusetts obtains, then this law is made
what its framers nevei intended it should be, and
will make the title as peifect a misnomer as c in
be conceived Undei this view, therefore, Í cor
tend that the construction sought to b° fixed up m
this law is inconeU, and cannot be sustained
What, then, is the Hue contiact between the pai-
ties' The gentleman fiom New York (M Sib'e) )
sa)sthat the statute constitutes the con íact It
appears to me to b* otnc rvvise The statute, I a.(\-
mit, pi escribes the contiact, but iotlnn„ mo e This
contia^i is tt l e in ¿tUug, and i s terms aie «-et
forth in the statute What ai-e tne)? The lan-
glacre of the statute is as follows
" B it fmthn enacted, Tnat the monev which
