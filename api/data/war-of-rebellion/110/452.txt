once, and thereby making them available as transports. I shall be gald to receive the general's instructions upon the subject. The Ferd. Kennett is here awaiting orders. By sending a smaller boat, say the Hope, or the Cotton Plant, or the Ben McCullohc, up and down Tchula Lake, we can easily keep the whole command supplied with everything it will reuqire at this time. I recommend that one of these boats be, if practicable, assigned to this service and be made subject to the orders of Major Mohler, the chief quartermaster here. Should the enemy establish his battery, as he is endeavoring to do, the supplies for Fort Pemberton will have to be landed hereabouts and hauled in wagons along the other side of the river, and therefore I shall urge forward some wagons from my division train. I have made arrangements to send by the Kennett for trenching tools. I shall now send out some unarmed mounted men to collect them. All I had here were sent up toward Fort pemberton last night. It will therefore be a matterof some difficulty for me to strengthen my position as I design doing, though I do not now see any pressing emergency for my so doing.

Very respectfully, yours,

DABNEY H. MAURY,

Major-General.
