HEADQUARTERS SIEGE ARTILLERY, July 6, 1864.

Brigadier-General HUNT,General Meade's Headquarters:

I hear that Russell's division of the Sixth Corps is on the move. If the demand for siege guns continues I shall soon need the Second Connecticut, which is in Upton's brigade, of this division. Cannot it be ordered on this duty at once, if its division is ordered off and more guns are likely to be needed?

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery, Commanding.

General Russell's division is not under orders. We will attend to the matter when you come to-morrow. Send no guns away without my orders.
