APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

S5th Cong....1st Sess.
Upon Nouns, Pronouns, Verbs, and Mverbs—Mr. Mams.
H. of Reps.
New England States foi the fourth instalment the whole
amount of the balances due fiom all their deposite banks, thf-ie
will remain due one million four hundied and thirty thousand
eight hunched and eighteen dollars and thirty one cents paya
ble to them
If you deduct the whole sum payable foi the fourth mstal
ment to the State of Mississippi irom the v hole amount of the
balances due on the 4th of Octobei by her late depesite banks,
there will remain due fiom them the sum of one million five
hundred and twenty eight thousand nine hundred and twenty
two dolíais and twenty three cents
The balancea due, therefore, from the deposite banks, in the
em*le State of Mississippi, a State with four electoral votes, are
nearly one hundied thousand dollars more than adequate to
pay the whole fourth instalment receivable by herself, and by
thosix New England S ates

Sir, I hope we shall hear no more of the necessity of raiding,
by taxation upon the people, the sums necessaiy for the pay
meotof the fourth instalment
I will not pursue this comparative review of the sums due
to each State for the fourth instalment, and of the sums due
from the deposite banks in oich iState thiough the whole
twenty five, (font seems there was no deposite bank in Arkan-
sas,) but if any indifferent peieon or philosophical observer
will compare the lelative imountof the three several columns
against the name of each State in this table, and then maik the
names in the lists of yeas and nays npon yom journal, first
on the passage of the act to postpone the fouith deposite mstal
ment, and then on the passage of this" act, I do assure him that he
will discover secrets worth knowing He will fi nd in these ele
ments a key to the system of measures prepared by the present
Executive foi the action of Congress, m tht*< emeigency, foi
relief to the distress of the country He will see how thet,e
measure? weie adapted in advance of each other—how the ex
ce*stve oalanccs due from one set of States were to be midt
easy, by withholding from anpthei set of States the foimh
instalment, to which they weie entitled He may chanco to
discover soiie insight into the art magie of application to mo
«ves He may trace the caupe of that uneasy solicitude mam
fested by more than one membei from the debtor States,
when the postponement bill was on its passage, to set it aside
and take up this bill, before they should be Compelled to vote
ay or no upon that
This bill, as it came from the Senate, was not sufficiently
indulgent to thtir delinquent banks Instead of four, six, and
nine months of delay befme they should be called to disgorge
their millions upen millions of the public spoils, n ne, fifteen,
twenty one monthsof time, were to be granted them, without
even the payment of interest to the pfunder ed sister Sta es
And here, on this floort we beheld a pledge demanded of the
chairman of the committee, and given by him, in the face of
the House, that when that bill should have passed, and this
one should be taken up, a libpral indulgence of time «should be
allowed to the ovei burdened in 1 discardt d deposttoiv bmk-,
That bargain was not only concluded in the piesence of the
House, but was signally and indignantly icbuked at the time
by two members of the House, one from GeorgiafMr Daw
son) and one fiom Ohio, (Mi Samson Masen,) yet we aie
now witnessing its consummation This bilí is toe equivalent
for the votes indispensable to carry that—this amendment is
thepremium pi&liciti<& fox the wear and tear of chastity in
the accomplishment of that
Sir. when that bill came from the Senate, and through that
body Vrom the Treasury, it came with fraud upon its face
Mr Cambrbleng called the gentleman from Massachusetts
to order, observing that that was not the first time that gentle
*ian had thus transgiessed the rule** of oider
The Chair (Mr Howaid of Maryland) could not see the
relevancy of Mr A's remarks to the subject beiore the com
Mr Adams Am I not permitted to refei to a hill, and to
the manner m which that bill passed the House, without which,
as I contend, this bill now before the committee would not be
here  at alii   [Cues from all sides of the House, "Gi on'
g0Mi-n aÍams lesumed the thread of his remarks Yes, su, it
came with fraud upon its face itprofessed to be a bill to pot,t
none the fourth instalment it was, in fact, a bill to refeal it
It was in fact, a bill to raise revenue, and, as such, not having
originated m this House ouf ht rievei to have been entei tamed
by it A member from South Caiohna (Mi Pickens) piopfx-ed
an amendment, which made it what it pi offered to be, abdl to
postpone the fourth instalment to a day fixed—the 1st of Janu
arv 1839, to which I proposed an additional amenlmcnt,ap
oropnating these balance-, due from the delinquent banks and
a supplementary fund if it should be necessary, foi punctual
payment at the day fixed bv th° amendment of tht gentleman
from South Caiohua Wi h thoae amendments I pledge 1 my
self to vote for the bill
I was fully aware of the sacrifice of the just lights and inte
rests of my own constituents t> which I miwi assent by voting
for the bill m that form, and 1 knew that I hazarded mcurm e
th  displeasure of some of them by yielding so much Rut I
knew they were a generous people I came here knowing th it
the executive administration was reduced to great straits for the
raewui to perform the pecuniary engagements of the nation In
their distress, however brought upon themselves, I saw only the
distress of the country, and trustel tnat my constituents would
sustain me in giving up a portion of then just claims for the
general benefit of all These were th*1 sentiments with which
I came to Washington, and a<? a pledge of their sincerity, I
offere¿*with these amendment*, to vota foe that bill, and how
was tins disposition received and returned 1 The chairman of
the Commiiiee of Ways and Means, substantially the repre
sentative of the Executive in this House, would neither accep
my amendment, nor that of the gentleman fiom South Caro
1m i He foiced the bill, with all i s imperfections on us head,
abit came irom the Senate, to a thud reading, and he carried
it m the fuhest vote ever taken in this House by yeas and nays,
119 to 117, and oí the 119, one was the gentleman from ¡south
Cuolma, who so voted, as he declaied at the time, foi the ex
press purpose of moving a reconsideration of the vote, which
he immediately did The real vote, therefote, was a tie, 118 to
US, and if the bill was to be carried at all, it could only be by
the casting vote of the Speaker The chairman of the Commit
tee of Ways and Means did not venture upon that experment
He voted agaiust the ie consideration himself, hut he sufTeied it
to be earned by his friends My amendment, which was no
thing more than a pleuge t^iat the bill as amended by the gen
tleman fiom feouth Caro'ma, should be executed m good faith,
he still re/used to accept Ninety four members of die House
voted for my amendment I ran not voush thateveiy one of
them would have voted for the bill, if the amendment had been
adapted, but I would have voted tor it myself I have reason
to believe that a majority, ií n«t all, of my colleagues would
have voted font, and 1 have no doubt that sixty or moieaihrm
atne votes would have been for the passage of the bill, beyond
the meagre majonty of twelve, which was seemed only by ac
ceptmg, as a forlorn hope the previously rejected amen Iment
of the gentleman from South Carolina
Mr Chairman, I impeach the smcenty of no man upon this
floor But when I paw the ehauman of the Committee of
Ways and Means cling so tenaciously to that bill as it came
from the Senate, when I saw him, at the last gasp, permit the
amendment of the gentleman irom South Carohni to be car
lied against his own vote, tosave thehfeof ihe bdl and when
I saw him still inflexibly excluding my amendment, and spurn
a majority of foul fifth*, of the Hout>e, on the passage of a bill
so immensely important to the administration a& that was, it
was imposeiblefor me to divert my own mmd from the mquny
why it was that so feeble a mjjoiity, purchased by so humih
ating a concision as had been extoited by the gentleman from
South Carolina should ha\e heen preferred loan almost unan
imous vote, obtained by the mere mite of additional conccssioi,
yielded by a pledge of laith that the piomise of that amendment
should be perfotn ed , and I could account for this piereien<ie
no otherwise than by the beliei that it is still not intended that
the fourth m- alment shall ever he paid , that the promise to
payiton thefirstof Januaiy, 1839 is a deception, and that the
amendment of tHe gentleman fiom South Caiohm will iaic no
better than the 13th and 14th sections of the deposite law of June
23 183b
How lar thisapmehension is prophetic wc sh ill «ce in the
course of the ensuing year, and I now predict that the piisent
postponement will be siicceede 1 by anothei 1 oat as (he firR
of fmuaiy 1819, shall approach new discovenes will be m ide

the instilment can not be pud wuhout a new tax upon ti e peo
pie If the money now in the delaulting deposite bank^ should
be collected by the Government, and applied to other pin poses,
to be sure, in that case, the fourth instalment can not be paid
without taxing anew the people to raise the money, and that is
precisely the reason why I anxiously wished to appropriate
the money while it wastheie Was it the íeasori whv the ap
propnation was so ¡btubbornly refund by the chairman of the
Committee of Ways and Means? Su, we have been told, ovei
and over, that the late deposite banks inLouisiana, m Alabama,
in Mississippi, m Ohio, in Kentucky, in Indiana, are all sound,
all solvent, all able and willing to pay every dollar of their d It,
give tlvnn but reasonab e time Then the money isthcie Ihe

let us now resume the com pan on in this tabular statement
between the arromt which by law   that is by the act of 231
June, lb36 should have been deposited in each of the etvtral
Sta'es and the amount which wa  actually depos.ted in the
same States at the commencement of the present session of
Congreso and onthe 4th of October, one month later  We have
gone through the New England States, and have there found the
deposites de jure moie than a million and a half of dollars, the
deposites^ facto lets than a tenth of that sum—less than one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars    We next c* me to New
York—the JDmpue State, her proportion of the fourth insta!
ment would have been one million three hundred and thntj
eight thomandone hundred and seventy three dollar  fifty =even
cent=5    The bum which her banks actually had m deposite ¿t
the commencement of the session was one million thiechm dred
and eighty six thousand nine hundred an 1 nineteen doUaio and
eighty two cents     Theie,sn, was. something like a set oiT no
injustice was done to the great State of New York     The depo
site of fact was about fitly thousand dolíais more than the depo
site of the law     Bu  the Secretary of the Treasuiy ha-> buen
most industriously occupied dunne the whole month of Sep
tember, in drawing off from tin. New York deposite banks the
balances due by them    By the last return  of the Ti easui er s
accounts, it appears that on the fourth of October there re
mimed in balances dut from all the deposite banks of the State
of New Yoikonly eight hundied and three thousand nve hun
died and seventy dolíais and seventy cents, nearly ^ix hundied
thousand dollars has been drawn from them in the moi th of
September    And fuithei   I have seen a senes of i evolutions

sembly of citizens of that ci y, mone of which it a^seited tlwt
the banks of that Sta'e hive paisJ off almost t1 e whole of the
balances due by them   '■Mr, oui compassion has been appealed
to in behalf of these southwestern b~nks     Wc have been told
it would b^crue1 to exact payment fiem those banks   that it
would be an ex post facto law to cnarge them with mteiest for
the public moneys, which they have received in deposi e, and
refu eto pay <it the íequisition of the Treasurv Department
that they can not themselves pay without exictmg payment
from their debtors, and that indulgence must be granted to them,
that they may be enabled to grant indulgence to (he people B\\
how stand* this argument, in its application to the bank  and
ppople of ihe \sr\Kl   The}, too, weie andaré indebted to then
banks    "Were thev not in need of indulgence, as much as the
people of Louisiana, of Mw^ippi of Alabama   of Kentucky
Ohio, Indian i Missouri, and Michigan?   But what has the Se
cretary of the Treasury been doma wuh the nl Ha he not been
draining th m almost to ttieir la«t doPar  as long as he coull
claim a dollai of balance from themi   And hate they not been
obliged to put the screws upon their debtors, that they might be
enabled to pay the balances due by them, at the rrqjisiunn of
the Secretary of the Treasure   Sir, the people of the "Vortn
have en lured, they aie now enduring, that very cruelty mdop

the West can not bear You aie straining from thorn their last
cent to pay their balancet, while u the same time you have

So Uhwcst and the West, there to be locked up fornnfe( fifteen,
and twnty one months, without payment ofintere&t, because U
would be a cruel ex post facto iaw to call upon them foi any

Let us pass over the State of New Jersey—no longer a doubi

The portion of the instalment which she ought on theiirstof
this tmnth'o have received was nine hundred and fifty'five
th uisanu eight hundred and thirty eisht dollars, and twenty six
cents The sum actually deposited m all her deposite banks,
at the commencement of the session, was 8255,445 92t and; on
the 4th of th s month, it had been re lucedto 9131/67 U Eight

and the cultivation of sugat and cotton Great and glonous as
hav^-been the exertion  and sacrifices of the State Of Fennsyl
vania m the cau^e of internal improvement, and m that career
she ha not been surpassed by any State m the Union, not even
by the Empue State, yet, ll I understand the chaiaaei of her
haidy yeomaniy aright not even their partiality to the demo
crai y of numbtts will leconcile them to the application of her
property to the multiplication Of slaves and slavery, for the
cultivation ofsugarand cotton, by abytiacung it from tlu api
propnations of her own Í egislature to internal improvements
within her own dunain rather more congenial to the pnnci

on ihe fust of this month *he was entitled to receive was
$318,bl1 "5 The sum which her deposite banks held m de

Youi State, Mi Chairman, has been marvellously well
treated, for one of tl e old thirteen Her cot uiruton to the

\t tht om luiceinent o'the pi^ cntses ion th whole amount
of balances due from her deposite banks to tl  Treasury of the
United States was 403,136 dollars and 97 cents Tins was njt
enough, sir, and, accordingly, on the fouith of this month, the
balance due from her deposite banks was 739,302 dolíais and
19 cents, not quite seven thousand dollars more thaia she was
entitled to ieceive for the foui th instalment She loses nothing
by the postponement, and thn bill gives hei the use of the
money for a term at least equivalent to the loss by the delay of
the postponement to the Kt of J mu ny 18 9 Virginia, there
fore is piopmited to^ecm^ the '•uflViee of her members in
Conffiess for the passage of both the bills—the postponement
bill and this bill, and you find most of them voting accordingly
By what art magic it ha= happened that while the balances of
all the other old thnteei but one were, between the commence

merely state the facts as I find them
But North Carolina has not been so favored Her portion
of the fourth instalment, payable on the ht of this month, was
477 919 dollars and 13 cents The balance due from her one
solitary deposite bank at the commencement of the session,
was 14b 030 dollars and 12 cents, which on the 4th of this
month, was reduced to 64 638 dollars and 61 cents The loss o*"
Virginia by the&e two bdlb—the«e Siamise twins—is nothing
The loss of Noith Caiolma, like that of the six New England
States, is almost total
South Caiolna and Georgia are not much be ter treated,
t1 ough with this difference the eum that each of them was
entitled to receive was the samrt, three hundred and fifty thou
sand four hundred and seventy t ur dolíais and three cents
The bilances due fiom the South Carolina ex deposite banks,
at the commencement of the sess on were one hundred and
f leven thousand five hurdred and ninety dollars and one cent;
those from the banks of Geoj <na were one hurdrcd ai d seventy

have enjoy ed the special pi i vdege of mere ismg their balances
of debt, while all the rest orthe old thu'een ha\e been mexora
bly held to contract theiis The in rease of the South Caro

rigor of exactions and was happily, simultaneous with a
conciliatory settlement nf old political balances here at the seat
of Government, which, to tho-=e who look a good deal ahead,
haa furnished the ma ernls for much speculative animad

And now, en, that we have seen how, by the postponement,
whi"h wa1* intended to have been, and still threatens to be, the
repeal of the fourth instalment, the old thirteen s ates have
been, \u h the single exception of Virginia, stunned of the
spoils of the public Treasuiy which had been allotted to tl em—
now that we have «een how with the same exception of Vir
