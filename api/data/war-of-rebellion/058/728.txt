General WILLIAM E. JONES,

Abingdon, Va.:

You will proceed to Morristown, Tenn., and report to General J. Longstreet for duty with your command.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Strawberry Plains, February 13, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

Corn is so scarce that we cannot fed our cavalry in front. If you could order even twenty days' forage for us it would aid us very much.

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

[First indorsement.]

Respectfully referred to the Quartermaster-General.

JNO. WITHERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Second indorsement.]

RICHMOND, February 15, 1864.

Respectfully returned to the Quartermaster-General, who will observe from the inclosed dispatches* what has been done by shipments of corn from Lynchburg for the relief of the command of General Longstreet, and what probably will be done during the next ten days. I think that within the coming twenty days at least 10,000 bushels of corn will be shipped from Lynchburg and from the line of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad to Major E. Taylor, quartermaster, Morristown, Tenn.

CHARLES S. CARRINGTON,

Major and Quartermaster.

[Third indorsement.]

Corn had been shipped to General Longstreet before the date of his dispatch, but had not then reached him.

A. R. LAWTON,

Quartermaster-General.

DALTON, February 13, 1864.

Lieutenant-General LONGSTREET,

Our scouts report that troops have been sent from Chattanooga to Loudon. They could not learn the number.
