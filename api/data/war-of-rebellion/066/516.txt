May 29, 1864.

Captain H. W. FEILDEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

CAPTAIN: I beg to call your attention to the fact that the heavy batteries on the Dawho and South Edisto Rivers are, of late, frequently threatened by the gun-boats of the enemy, and that these batteries are manned only by a detachment of 20 men of Company D, Fourth Florida Battalion, the remainder of the company being on duty at Combahee Ferry in Third Military District. In addition to the fact that these men are insufficient in number, they are very imperfectly skilled as heavy artillerists. I have the honor to request that at least one large company of well-drilled heavy artillerymen may be sent me to work my heavy guns properly.

I am, captain, very respectfully, &c.,

B. H. ROBERTSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
