General HUMPHREYS:

A deserter from the Second Florida came in about 10 o'clock last night. He brings the following additional information: That Wright's brigade moved last evening to the right, and relieved Heth's division, which marched to the north side of the Appomattox. This was generally understood in informant's brigade. Does not know of any other movement. The following telegram has been received from Colonel Sharpe, at City Point:

Received last night one captain and nine men from Second Corps. They were from Kershaw's and Bryan's brigades, McLaws' division. Marched from Petersburg over the James Monday evening. McGowan and Lane, of Wilcox's division, Hill's corps, were also there as well as the Tennessee brigade, of Beauregard's corps. The four-gun battery belonged to Ewell's corps, left behind by Early on account of size. They are the same guns lately used up and down the river against our vessels. Prisoners claim they have information that Early has again reached the Potomac. They do not expect to win at Atlanta.

NOTE.- A duplicate of above telegram forwarded to General Grant by Colonel Sharpe.
