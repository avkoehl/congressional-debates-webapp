HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Washington, D. C., April 17, 1865.

Respectfully referred to the Secretary of War.

My own views are that it will be better to have Mosby's and White's men in Maryland as paroled prisoners of war than at large as guerrillas. I would exact, however, that all should be required to register their names and residence with the nearest provost-marshal to the place where they intend to live.

I would required each man to sign his own parole, instead of allowing officers to sign for their men.
