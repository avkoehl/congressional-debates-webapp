APPENDIX TO THE CONGKESSIONAL GLOBE.

country and sung praises in thefr own lauda-
tion because they had enacted and heaped
denunciation upon us because we had opposed
the odious, unequal, and oppressive tax act
approved by President Grant July 14, 1870.
I am pained, sir, to be compelled to admit
that that act was framed by an Ohioan, (Mr.
Schenck,) and voted for by every Federalist
from that State who amuses himself and seeks
to deceive the people by calling himself a
republican, Mr. Winans excepted. What, sir,
is this law which the plundered people of
the West and South and were called upon
to applaud? Let us see. According to the
figures of Mr. Delano, during the current year
Ohio will pay $16,062,000, and Massachu-
setts $4,400,000; Ohio, $11,618,000 more than
Massachusetts ; Ohio, $16,062,000; and the six
States of New England only $6,508,000 ; Ohio,
$9,554,000 more than the six States of New
England. Why should not Ohioans rejoice ?
Why should they not feel proud of then-
legislators who betrayed them and voted in
the interest of the New England monopolists!
But let us not stop here. While we have the
dissecting knife in hand let us open the bowels
of this law and examine their contents. The
tax-payers of Illinois should be happy; for this
year they will pay to the army of Federal tax-
gatherers $15,263,000, $10,819,000 more than
will be paid by Massachusetts, and $8,755,000
more than all the New England States. Why
should not the people of Illinois be satisfied ?
Ought they not to vote to keep their plunder-
ers in power? Kentucky will pay $8,709,000,
$4,265,000 more than Massachusetts, and
$2,201,000 more than the six States of New
England. Why, then, should not " the hunt-
ers of Kentucky" feel proud and joyous at the
thought that they pay the taxes of the New
England Federalists? "Old Virginia," not
yet recovered from the shook of the conflict
which converted her whole territory into a
battle- field and gave her towns and cities to the
flames—Virginia is required to pay $500,000
more taxes than Massachusetts; and Missouri,
whose condition was much like that of Vir-
ginia, is forced to pay $38,000 more than that
State, and Indiana has to pay nearly as much.
The tax paid by Massachusetts for this year
is less than one fourth the sum paid by her
in 1868, while Ohio pays nearly four millions
more. The tax of New Hampshire is only
one eighth of the amount paid in 1868, while
the tax of Illinois is more than doubled. The
tax of Maine is only one sixth as much as in
1868 ; while the tax of Indiana is nearly twice
as much. The tax paid by Vermont is less
than one seventh of the sum paid by her in
1868, while the tax on Virginia is increased
threefold, fhe tax paid by Connecticut is less
than one fourth the sum paid by her in 1868,
while that of Kentucky is more than doubled.
In 1868 the tax paid by New England was
$29,000,000; in 1871, $6,500,000. In 1868 the
tax paid by the three western States of Ohio,
Indiana, and Illinois, and the three southern
States of Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia,
was $82,900,000, and in 1871 $53,500,000.
The act of July 14, 1870, reduced the tax
paid by New England more than twenty-two
millions under the amount paid in 1868, and
increased the tax paid by the three southern
and three western States just named more
than twenty millions; twenty-odd millions
taken from Uie shoulders of New England to
be imposed upon the shoulders of six agri-
cultural States.
Mr. BE AIT Y. Will my colleague allow
me to interrupt him?
Mr. MORGAN. For a question.
Mr. BEATTY. I would ask my colleague
if a large proportion of the amount paid in
Ohio is not paid by the distillers, and paid back
to them again by the consumers of whisky?
Mr. MORGAN. It affords me pleasure to
answer my friend's inquiry, although' I should
have noticed the point that he makes in the
course of my remarks. Before answering him
let me call the attention of the honorable gen-
tleman to the amount of taxes paid by New
England during the years 1868, 1869, 1870,
and the estimated amount for 1871. In 1868
the aggregate amount paid was twenty-nine
million odd thousand dollars; in 1869, four-
teen million odd thousand dollars ; in 1870,
sixteen million odd thousand dollars; while
for the current year it is estimated by Com-
missioner Delano that the whole amount to
be paid by New England is only $6,508,000,
a reduction of about twenty-three million dol-
lars since 1868.
Now, sir, how came this reduction? How did
it happen? Why was it brought about? Sir,
it was brought about through the skill and
ingenuity of the members"from New England,
and especially from Massachusetts. They
demanded that the tax upon manufactures
should be taken off; and it was taken off.
And when we told them that the tax upon
the manufactured goods was paid by those
who bought them they still claimed that New
England was a sufferer; that the amount of
taxes in money was withdrawn from her State
and from her circulating medium, thereby
causing embarrassment to her trade ; that if
the tax was not taken off her mills would stop,
thousands of persons be thrown out of employ-
ment, and general distress follow. Now, sir,
one of the very things concerning which I was
about to complain was that the products of
Ohio, the products of Indiana, the products
of Illinois, and of the great West and South
generally, are taxed, that their manufactures
are taxed, while the tax has been removed from
the manufactures of New England. Since 1868
the amount of tax upon the New England
States has been reduced $22,250,000. But
revenue had to be raised. New Englanders
were relieved from taxation, and Ohio men,
Indiana men, Virginians, Missourians, and
Kentuckians must pay their own taxes, and
the taxes of New England into the bargain.
Mr. Speaker, I have no desire to do New
England injustice. I would not wrong her cit-
izens; I would impose neither unjust nor
unequal burdens upon them, but when New
England throws the burdens which rightfully
belong to her upon the shoulders of my con-
stituents and the people of the West, th^n in
their name I do complain. The act of July
was voted for by every supporter of the Admin-
istration from the State of Ohio but one, and
he was not in his seat. It was voted for by my
colleague who just propounded to me that ques-
tion ; he voted to make the tax of Ohio more
than sixteen millions, and the tax of the whole
of the New England States only six.
Mr. BEATTY. I would like to ask my
colleague this question: is not the larger pro-
portion of the tax which is paid under the
internal revenue law in Ohio paid by the man-
ufacturers of whisky, and do not these men
get back this tax from the people of New
England where the whisky is consumed?
Mr. MORGAN. Consumed in New Eng-
land?
Mr. BEATTY. Not altogether; I mean
from the consumers, be they where they may.
Mr. MORGAN. I have no trouble in an-
swering my friend, and it affords me pleasure
to do so.
Mr. HOLMAN. My friend from Ohio [Mr.
Morgan] will permit ine to say that the fact
of there being now on the floor no other gen-
tleman from New England than the gentleman
who presides [Mr. Brooks, of Massachusetts]
will explain why this implied charge that New
England consumes all the whisky manufac-
tured in Ohio is not promptly met and refuted.
Mr. BEATTY. I-do not charge that New
England consumes all the whisky. But I say
that the consumers of whisky, wherever they
may be, pay this tax back to the distillers in
Ohio ; the men who manufacture the whisky.
I have no doubt, however, that a very consid-
erable proportion is consumed in New Eng-
land.
Mr. MORGAN. Mr. Speaker, a tax upon
a manufactured article is a tax upon the raw
material from which the article is made.
When you impose a tax upon wool, it enters
into the manufactured article made of wool.
When you impose a tax on whisky, you
impose thereby a tax upon corn, barley, rye,
wheat, and all other articles of which whisky
is manufactured, and beyond this it is a tax
on the skill and machinery employed-. Now,
sir, if it were the fact that this tax upon
whisky had for its object any moral or honest
purpose, we might possibly bear it wifh a little
more patience than we are now disposed to
do. I admit that there is a considerable tax
upon corn, wheat, rye, and barley, from which
whisky is manufactured. I admit that, like
goods, which, after going through certain pro-
cesses, are purchased at a higher price than
they otherwise woujd be by the consumer,
whether he be the man who drinks the toddy
or wears the coat.
But, sir, if you will ask the New Englander
whether it was a blessing for him to have a
tax imposed upon his woolen manufactures
and his cotton manufactures, he will tell you
" no." We were told and told again that New
England was being ruined by the tax upon
manufactures; that some of her mills were
stopped; that hundreds of men were out of
employ. Why? Because a heavy tax was
imposed upon their manufactures. Yet these
same New England gentlemen who succeeded
in having the tax removed from their manu-
factures imposed a heavy tax on ours; and I
regret that my colleague [Mr. Beatty] has
joined with New England in imposing this
burden upon the people of his own district
and his own State.
I now propose to call attention very briefly
to the decrease in taxation concerning which
so much has been said. In Connecticut in
1868 the tax was more than $4,000,000; in
1869 it was somewhat over $2,000,000; in
18<0 it rather exceeded $2,000,000; and in
1871 it has fallen to $1,000,000, being only
one fourth as much as it was in 1868. In 1868
thi3 tax in Maine amounted in round num-
bers to $1,500,000; in 1869 if, was a little over
$500,000; in 1870 it was about $800,000; and
in 1871, $261,000, about one sixth as much as
in 1868. In 1868 the tax paid by Massachu-
setts was $17,700,000; in 1869, $9,000,000;
in 1871, $4,444,000.
Now let us see, on the other hand, how this
scale of reduction in taxation works in the
State of Ohio. In 1868 the amount of internal
revenue collected from Ohio was $12,000,000;
in 1869, $16,000,000; and in 1870, $19,000,000.
Then came areduetion of taxes, and theamount
was fixed at $16,062,000 for Ohio in 1871, and
only $6,500,000 for all of New England. From
the fiscal year 1868 to the fiscal year 1870 the
internal revenue of Massachusetts fell from
$17,000,000 to $10,000,000, while that of Ohio
increased from $12,000,000 to $19,000,000, and
thatof Illinois from $7,000,000 to $18,000,000.
Mr. BEATTY. Allow me to ask the gen-
tleman a question ?
Mr. MORGAN. Get my time extended to
two hours, and I will have no objection to
answer all the questions which the gentleman
may put to me. I will hear my colleague's
question, however, as I wish to be courteous
to him.
Mr. BEATTY. The people of New Eng-
land, according to your own statement, make
