line was occupied to-day, by direction of the major-general commanding the department, by troops sufficient to make one rank. Nothing special occurred in front. Picket-firing was quite brisk, and a few shells thrown from the enemy's batteries.

Respectfully submitted.

I have the honor to report that nothing of interest occurred in my front to-day. The enemy was quite busy with his artillery to-day, doing us but little damage, considering the amount of firing done. My command occupied the new line this morning one hour before daylight, keeping one regiment in reserve, which occupies that portion of the old line on the right of De Gress' battery. A portion of the troops in the line were occupied in trimming up and strengthening the work, and to-night will complete it, extending and throwing forward my right to connect more perfectly with General Woods' division and cover a ravine.

All of which is respectfully submitted.

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance has occurred in my front during the day. Quite an artillery duel has been kept up, but I have sustained no damage by it. There was quite a heavy infantry fire in my front about 10 o'clock last evening, but I think the cause was more imaginary than real by both parties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I have the honor to report nothing special in my front to-day except that I advanced the right of my skirmish line to connect with General Woods' left, taking three skirmish-pits occupied by the rebels in my front, which drew a considerable fire from the enemy's batteries, doing me but little damage.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. J. LIGHTBURN,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
