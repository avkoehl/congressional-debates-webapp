Mr. FENTON. Mr. President, I hardly ex-
pect to do more at present than to call atten-
tion to the important subject presented by the
bill I have introduced looking to a reform in
the customs service of the United States; but
I trust to renew the discussion next session,
and hope then to obtain a favorable expression
of the Senate.
I do not exaggerate in asserting that our
present customs service, as practically admin-
istered, mainly under laws framed at an early
period in our national history, when the mag-
nitude of our commerce and the modes and
channels of conducting commerce differed so
essentially from the present day, is entirely
inadequate duly to protect the interests of the
Government, is injurious to the honest im-
porter, and encourages the perpetration of
fraud by offering inducement to the commis-
sion of crime. Without entering now in detail
upon the consideration of the special features
of this bill, I will state that the information
elicited under the authority of the resolution
I had the honor to introduce on the 14th of
December last, and to which response has
recently been made by the Secretary of the
Treasury, tends to establish the following im-
portant facts:
First. That large amounts of money are
received by collectors and other officers from
those who have defrauded the revenue upon
settlement of cases of fraud orsmuggling, under
judgments obtained in court, usually by con-
fession; and that the amount of money tlius
received at the port of New York since the 1st
day of January, 1870, will not fall short of the
sum of $500,000.
Second. That out of the moneys so received
by the Treasury one half has been paid to the
collector, naval officer, and surveyor, and to
informers, making the pay of the above-named
officials at the port of New York ai least
$50,000 each per annum.
Third. That the names of the operators in
fraud and smuggling and the names of those
who profit by their crime are, to a large extent,
disclosed.
Fourth. That of all the criminals engaged
in defrauding the revenue but few have been
presented to the grand jury, and fewer con-
victed, for several years past.
Fifth. That while the present system of
moieties continues, it is made the direct pecun-
iary interest of the officers named that this
species of crime should go unpunished and the
fraudulentpractiees continue to be perpetrated.
Sixth. That when judgment is obtained or set-
tlement made with parties who have defrauded
the revenue by false weights, or false quantities
and qualities of goods, the Government does
not receive the full duties to which it is entitled
before dividing the amount thus received with
the officers of customs and informers.
Seventh. That often frauds of great magni-
tude are not discovered until after the lapse
of the time fixed by lawâtwo yearsâwhich
limits criminal prosecution._
Eighth. That the expenditure for collection
of customs is more than is required.
Ninth. That while the salaries and perqui-
sites of some of _Uie officials are greatly in
excess of what is atHquate to their duties and
responsibilities, the salaries of other sare too
small.
Tenth. That in some departments or divis-
ions more officers are employed than are neces-
sary, while in others men are worked to their
fullest capacity.
Eleventh. That the present manner of con-
ducting the warehouse business needs reform,
and that officers of the customs, it is believed,
are to some extent interested in the business,
which is alike improper and illegal.
Twelfth. That the general-order business
as at present conducted is injurious to the
interests of the merchants, subjecting them to
increased expenditure, and frequently causing
great delay, thereby enhancing the price at
which goods can be placed upon the market
for consumption, which is a tax upon the
consumer and an injury to the Government.
Thirteenth. That the present system of pub-
lic cartage needs reforming.
I will not now dwell upon these several
points, and I am not sure that it will be im-
portant or necessary at any time, as the mere
statement of facts will suffice to incline those
who are well disposed to give a full and fair
investigation to the whole subject. To such
the bill I present as a remedy for the abuses
known or believed to exist will find ample
justification, while no amount of testimony
will be sufficient for those who desire to per-
petuate the present order of things. I will
refer, however, to the fact that under the pres-
ent system the collector, naval officer, and sur-
veyor enjoy powers, privileges, and benefits
which, while pecuniarily advantageous to them,
tend directly to draw money from the Treasury
that legitimately belongs to the Government.
In support of this it is only necessary to exam-
ine the laws, deeisiona, and authorities which
allow these officers moieties of the fines, pen-
alties, and forfeitures exacted by judgments of
courts, or upon settlements from offenders
against the various custom laws and the prac-
tices which have thus grown up and prevail.
It will be found that the seizures of goods
attempted to be smuggled into the port of New
York during the last three years have amount-
ed to an annual average of over three hundred
thousand dollars. In addition to this, full
$500,000 has been collected from fines and
penalties for defrauding the revenue. The
goods seized generally come- within the class
called luxuries, and are those which pay the
highest rates of duty, or are of the greatest
value; such, for instance, as silks paying sixty
per cent, ad valorem; bay oil, which pays six
hundred per cent., and other essential oils;
laces, diamonds, watches, and jewels of all
descriptions. With reference to the class of
importers who have by false invoices, or by
fraud and collusion, defrauded the revenue, it
will be found that they are mainly those who
have no real interest in our Government or its
credit, but aliens, and agencies representing
foreign houses.
And here I desire to accept the favorable
opportunity presented by this discussion to
repel an imputation recently made in this
Chamber, to the effect that the interests of
the prominent New York merchants are not
identical with a faithful and honest adminis-
tration of the customs department; that they
are prone to complain when the officers in
charge do well, and to be i^uiet when corrupt
