th  posture of the question, and it is one which
A.meuca can no longer tolerate. She must vindi-
cate her rights on the Columbia; and that vindica-
tion will not be effected without the exhibition of a
war countenance on our side It i« a second
Nootka Sound contest. The Spaniard*, by pre-
paring for war, avoided war, and saved their t$r-
i'etory and their honor at Nootka It remains tor
us to mutate their example. Careless, or ignorant,
or treacherous diplomacy, has involved Ub m this
condition; arms, or the show of arms, only will re-
lease us from it. The British will hold on after
they receive notice to quit. The Columbia ques-
tion will become an affair of the fust magnitude
  between us and the English; and the aspect of thi 
question is one of the reasons which now requires
us to prepare for war; and, tor that purpose, to
adopt the amendment which is now proposed to
thubill
The other cause of dissension between the
United State? and Great Britain, which I propose
to bring to the notice of the S na'e, is the exist-
ence and the machinations of organized societies
ÍP. London, occupied with the question of slavery
m our Southern States, and tending to pro iuc> an
insurrection among us. The existence of this so-
ciety is known to the world It glorie^ m its exist
ence, and has the audacity to address is diaboli-
cal publications not only to our own slaves, but to
their master, and even to the func'ionatits of < ur
Government! They are numerous, powerful ard
zealous, and are aided by affiliated societies in Ca-
nada, and in our own country, and by agents and
emissaries which penetrate the slave States, and
insinuate themselves among the blacks, whom th«y
eseite to discontent, and stimulate to insurrection
The toleratien of such a society in the metropolis of
the British empire, is just cause of complaint
against the Butish Government It is a violation
of the laws of nations, and of the laws of friend-
ship. The effect upon the temper of our slave
population is already visible to every eye They
are becoming restless, disobedient, pione to crime,
and disposed to escape from service Fire, both
in towns, and in country houses, 1  nov the fam -
liar work of their hands Robberies are mcessaut
The murderof a white man is a common and mdit-
ferent occurrence. Innumerable are the children
which perish in variou >. ways ftom the resentments
of servants,and nurses against the parents of the in-
nocents. Flight to the British dominions in Canada
is organized into system, and pursued to excess
The Montreal Courier computes the numbei al-
ready arrived in those Provinces at twenty thou-
sand souls This is the present state of the evil,
and this evil augment1? itself daily. The result
must be a great catastrophe London is the seat
of the society whose affiliated societies in Canada,
and some of the Northern States, labor at the
work which is to end in producing upon our soil a
second edition of the dreadful tragedy of San Do-
mingo. Do people know—does the present gene
ration of our population know—by what imans
that tragedy was produced, and what weit its hor-
rors? Do they know its primary cause, and dread-
ful issue? Doubtless msiny knew, but, equally
certain, the mass of our people are wholly unin-
formed upon both points They neither know
how the San Domingo insurrection was produced,
nor the horrors of which it was the author For
the information of such, and to warn ihein m tirre
against the perils of a similar fate, I will read
some passages from a British author, which will
show that this dreadful insurrection had its ougm
in London, and that us atrocities exceed all that
the pen of man has yet described, or imagination
conceived. I read from Edward's History of the
West Indies. Listen to what he says in replying
to the inquiry as to the ORIGIN and the PRI
MARY CAUSE oe this great revolt    He'says-
"In order to reply to this question with as much accuracy
and precision as the subject wiil admit, it is necessary to recur
to the proceedings of the two associations, of which mention
was made m the second chapter of this histoiy namely ttu
British association for the al olition of the slave tiade, which
held its meetings in the Ol  Jewky in London, an 1 the society
called Les amis des Nmrs in Pans A sioit review of the
conduct of these societies will serve not Only to lessen the sm
prise which may be felt at the revolt of the negroes of San Do
mingo, but also raise a considerable degree of astonishment that
the enslaved negroes m the British islands had not given ihein
th  «sample
"I have observed that the Society in London professed to
have nothing more in view than to obtain an act of the Legisla
ture for prohibiting the further introduction of African slaves
into the British colonies 1 have said that they disclaimed all
intention of interfering with the government and condition of
the negroes already m the plantations, publicly declaring their
opinion to be, that a general emancipation of those people, in
their present state of ignorance and barbarity, instead of a
blessing, would prove to them the source of misfortune and
misery But although such were their ostensible declarations
as a public body, the leading members of the society, in the
same moment, held a very different language, and even the so
ciety itself (acting as such) pursued a line of conduct directly
and immediately repugnant to their own professions Besides
using every possible endeavor to inflame the public of Great
Britain against the planters, they distributed, at a prodigious
expense, throughout the colonies, tracts and pamphlets without
number the direct tendency of which was to render the white
inhabitants odious and contemptible m the eyes of their own
slaves, and excite in the latter such ideas of their own natural
rights and equality of condition, as should lead them to a gene
rat struggle for freedom through rebellion and bloodshed
"In many of those writings, aiguments are expiessly ad
duccd, in language which cannot fee misunderstood, to urge
the negroes to rise up and murder their masters without mer
cy 'Resistance, say they, is always justifiable where force
is the substitute of right, nor is the com? iission of a civil
crime possible in a state of slavery ' These sentiments are
repeated in a thousand different foims, and in order that they
misht not lose their effect by abstract reasoning, a reverend
divine of the Chuich of England (Mr Peicival Stockdale,) m
a pamphlet addressed to the chairman or the president of the
society which held its meetings in the OLD JEWRY, (Gran
ville Shai p, e-q ) pours forth the most earnest prayers, m the
most mi iisguised expiessions, that the negioes would destroy
all the white people—men, women and children—in the West
India Islands 'Should we not,' he exclaims, 'approve their
conductm their violence? Should we not crown it with eulo
giumif they exterminate their tyrants with fire and sword'
¡should they even deliberately inflict the most exuuisite tor
tuies on those tyrants, would they not be excusable m the mo
ral judgment of i hose who properly value those inestimable
blessings—rational and rehgiousliberty')'
"Besides distributing pamphlets of this complexion gratis,
at the doors of all the churches and places of woiship m the
kingdom, and throughout the colonies, the society, or persons
in then name, caused a medal to be struck, containing the
figure of a naked negro lotde 1 with chains, and in the attitude
of imploring meicy, thousands of which were also dispersed
among the negroes m each of the sugar islands, for the mstruc
tion I piesume of such ofthem as could notiead, but, unhap
pity, tnis instance of provident caution was not requisite, for
so many negro domestics return annually from Europe, to the
West Indies, as constantly furnish a sufficient number of living
instructors, and cei tain it is—I pronounce it from my own
knowledge íespecting lamaica—that the labois of the society
on their behalf, as well many ol the most violent speeches in
the British Parliament wherein the whole body of the plantéis
were painted as a her 1 of blood thirsty and remorseless ty-
rants, weret-^plainedtothe ntgro slaves, mteims well adapted
to then capacities, and suited as might have been supposed, to
their feelings It will be difficult to say what other measures
the OLD IEWR.Y associates could have taken to excite a re
bellion, except that of furnishing the objects of their solicitude
with fire arms and ammunition "
It is thus to the machinations of the Anti-Slave
Trade Society in London, aided by the society of
the friends of th" blacks m Pans, and the cele-
brated letter of the abbe Gregoire to the people of
color in San Domingo that this dire insurrection is
traced In its origin and primary cause, it is traced
to London; and who trut has paid any attention to
passing events does not perceive ihe same work
?oing on in London now which went oi there fifty
years ago, and produced such terrific results in the
West Indies' The same publications, the same
speeches, the same pamphlets, the same pictures,
the same medals, the same denunciation of the
whites, commiseration of the blacks, mvcatton to
revolt, and exultation at its succss. All is on
the same plan; but the operations of the present
society are more direct, open, powerful, and concen-
trated; and much more easily brought to bear upon
the dupes(and victims of their policy The society at
the Old Jswity had to operate upon slaves at a
greater distance, speaking a different language, in-
habiting an island, and of difficult access- the pie-
sent society, by their affiliations in Canada and the
Northern States, and by the intercourse of com-
merce and tra/el, are ¡n direct contact with the ob-
jects of 'heir machinations, and speak to them in
the language which is their own The slaves, too,
are many times more numerous here than in San
Dooimgo How much greater then is the danger?
But, let us proceed with the reading, and see the
truits of the machinations of which the source has
been traced to a society of fanatics, pseudo, phi-
anthropists, m the city of London The author
¡hus desenbss the breaking out of the revolt.
"It was on the morning of the 23d of August, just before
day, that a general alarm and consternation spread throughout
the town of the Cape    The inhabitants were called from their
I eds by persons who reported, that all the negro slaves in the
everal neighboring parishes had revolted, and were, at that
moment carrying death and desolation over the adjoining large
and beautiful plain to the Northeast The Governor, and most
of the military officers on duty, assembled together, but the
i eports were so confined and contradictory, as to gam but little
II edit; when, as daylight began to break, the sudden and suc-
cessive arrival, with ghastly countenances, of persons who had
with difficulty escaped the mas«acre, and flown to the town
for protection, brought a dreadful confirmation of the fatal
tidings
' The approach of daylight seemed Only to discover sights of
horror It was now apparent that the negroes on all the es
tates in the plain acted in concert, and a general massacre of
the whites took place in eveiy quarter On some few of the
estates indeed the lives of the women were spared, but they
were reserved only to gratify the brutal appetites of the ruf
fians, and it is shocking to relate, that many ofthem suffered
violation on the dead bodies of then husbands and fathers'
"In the town itself, the general belief for some time was, that
the i evolt was by no means an extensive, but a sudden and par
tial msuirection only The largest sugar plantation on the
plain was that of Mons Galhfet, situated about eight miles
from the town, the neg oes belonging to which had always been
treatej with such kindness and libeiality, and possessed so ma
ny advantages, that it became a proverbial expression among
the lower white people m speaking of any man's good fortune,
to say, i! est heureux eomme un negre de Galhfet, (he is as
happy as one of Gdlhfet's negroes ) M Odeluc, the attorney
or agent foi this plantation, was a member of the General As
sembly, and being fully persuaJed that the negi oes belonging
to it would remain firm in their obedience, determined to re
pair thither to encourage them m opposing the insurgents, to
which end he desired the assistance of a few soldiers from the
town guard, which was grante 1 him He proceedod accord
mgly, but on approaching the estate, to his surprise and grief
he found all the negroes in arms on the side of the rebels, (and
horrid to tell') then standard was the body of a white infant,
which they had íecently impaled on a stake' M Odeluc had
advanced too far to retreat undiscovered, and both he, and a
friend that accompanied him, with most of the soldiers were
killed without mercy Two oi three only of the patrol escaped
by flight, and conveyed the dreadful tidings to the inhabitants
of the town
"By this time, all or most of the white persons that had been
found on the several plantations, being massacred, or
forcedto seek theirsafetym flight, the ruffians exchanged the
sword for the toi ch The buildings and cane fields were every
where set on fire, and the conflagrations, which were visible
from the town, m a thousand different quarters, furnished a
prospect more shocking, and reflections more dismal, than fan
cy can paint, or the powers of man describe
"Consternation and terroi now took possession of every
mind, and the scieams of the women and children, running
from door to door, heightened the horrors of the scene All
the citizens took up arms, and the General Assembly'rested the
Governor with the command of the national guards, request
llighim to give such orders as the urgency of the case seemed to
demand
"These two districts therefore, the whole of the rich and ex
tensive plain of the cape, together with the contiguous moun
tains, were now wholly abandoned to the ravages of the enemy,
and the cruelties which they exercised, uncontrolled, on such of
the miserable whites as fell into their hands, cannot be remem
bered without hoi or, nor reported in teims strong enough to
convey a propel idea of their atrocity
"They seized Mr Bien an officer of the police, and havirg
nailed him alive to oneof the gates of his plantation, chopped
oil his limb*, one by one with an axe
"A poor man named Robert a cai penter by trade, endeavor
ing to conceal himself fiom the notice of the rebels, was dis
covered m his Indina place, and the savages declared that lie
should die in the way of hit accupanon accordingly they
bound him between two boards, and deliberately sawed him
asunder
"Mr Cardmeau, a planter of Grande Riviere hadtwonatu
ral sons by a black woman He had manumitted them in their
infancy, and bred them up with great tenderness They both
joined in the revolt, and when then father endeavored to divert
them from their purpose by soothing language and pec jniary
offers, they took his money, and then stabbed him to the heart
"All the white, and even the mulatto children whose fathers
had not joined m the revolt, were murdered without exception,
frequently before the eyes or clinging to the bosoms, of their
mothers, young women of all ranks w ere first violated by a
whole troop of barbarian , and then generally put to death Some
of them were indeed reseived for the further gratification ef
thelustof the savages, and others had their eyes scooped out
with a knife
"In the parish of Limbi, at a place called the Great Ravine,
a venerable planter, the father of two beautiful young ladies,
was tied down by a savage ringleader of a band, who ravished
the eldest daughter m his presence, and delivered over the
youngest to one of his followers, their passion being satisfied,
they slaughtered both the father and the daughters
"To detail the various conflicts, skirmishes, massacres, and
scenes of slaughter, which this exterminating war produced,
were to offer a disgusting and frightful picture—a eombina
tion of horrors—wherein we should behold cruelties unex
ampled in the annals ofmankmd, human blood poured forth m
torrents; the earth blackened with ashes, and theair tainted
with pestilence It was computed that, within two months after
the revolt first began, upwards of two thousand white persons,
ofall conditions and ages had been massaereed—that one hun
dred and eighty sugar plantations, and about nine hundred
coffee, cotton, and indigo settlements had been destroyed (the
buildings thereon being consumed by fire,) and one thousand
two hundied Christian families reduced from opulence, to such
a state of misery, as to depend altogether for their clothing and
sustenance on public and private charity Of the insurgents, it
was reckoned that ten thousand had perished by the sword or by
famine and some hundreds by the handsofthe executioner,
many of them, I am sorry to say, under the torture of the
wheel, a system of revenue and retaliation, which no enormi
ties of savage life could justify or excuse "
This, sir, is the nature of a negro insurrection;
this the horror of such a revolt; and this was the
work of a London society—a society no way com-
parable in numbers, wealth, zeal, organization and
facility of action, to that which now exist*, and is
new laboring at the same object. What the for-
mer society accomplished is full proof of what the
present one will be able to do. Even m 1794,
when an insurrection on our continent was not a
part of the plan, yet even then the parts nearest to
