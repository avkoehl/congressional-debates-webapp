which Colonel Blake is the ranking colonel. General Grose was temporarily in command of the brigade to which Colonel Blake's regiment belongs, because when General Grose returned from leave of absence last fall General Whitaker was commanding the First Division, to which General Grose's proper brigade belongs, and he (Grose) was averse to serving under the command of General Whitaker. Since General Whitaker went to the Legislature, General Grose has been commanding his old brigade (Third, of First Division). Colonel Blake was assigned to duty in Nashville because I considered the officer next in rank (Colonel Lane) a more competent brigade commander.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
