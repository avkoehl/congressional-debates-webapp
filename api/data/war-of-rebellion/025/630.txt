TUPELO, MISS., June 30, 1862.

General GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch about General Preston's staff was received and sent to him for information, as I replied. He is with Breckinridge's division. Was at Vicksburg. Will inform you as soon as he replies. Bombardment at Vicksburg for three days. No harm done our batteries. About forty vessels are below; if they land, Van Dorn will defeat them. Your news is most exciting. I will start immediately to threaten, and, if possible, will attack. A part of Buell's force is still his side of Tennessee.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General, Commanding.
