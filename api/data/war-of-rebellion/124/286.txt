BALLOON CAMP,

Doctor Gaines" House, June 7, 1862.

Brigadier-General HUMPHREYS, or

General MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

I ascended at 6 o"clock and remained up in all about one hour. The enemy appears to be in larger force on our left than at any other point. Our advance and the enemy's artillery are less than one mile from each other. The artillery that I refer to is about half a mile to the left of the New Bridge road, in the field and behind the woods on the opposite heights, with horses attached; there is more in the rear, with horses picketed. Their picket-line is not so far advanced as formerly. Several squads of cavalry were visible along the opposite heights. There are large camp smokes opposite Mechanicsville and beyond, but the dense haze prevents me at this time from observing details.

The Intrepid will lift three persons and ropes, and there will be an excellent opportunity for engineers to ascend. I will go up early in the morning again.

Your very obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut.

BALLOON CAMP,

Doctor Gaines" House, June 9, 1862.

Brigadier-General HUMPHREYS, or

General MARCY,

Chief of Staff:

I ascended at sundown this p.m. and find the enemy's camps located about the same as they have been for the past four or five days.

Two sections of a battery, of three guns each, are stationed in the field (with horses attached) about three-quarters of a mile southeast from Doctor Garnett's house. Two other batteries are stationed near Old Tavern. Very heavy camps are still beyond and to the right toward Richmond. There are also three distinct camps extending from Widow Price's to Doctor Friend's, on a road this side of the New Bridge road.

Pickets are visible near General Smith's advance, but no fires are built. The enemy's smokes immediately in front of the late battle-grounds are very light. Owing to the lateness of the hour before I could ascend, in consequence of the heavy winds, I was unable to finish my observation to the right, but will ascend as often as possible.

Your very obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut, Army of the Potomac.

BALLOON CAMP,

Doctor Gaines" House, June 10, 1862-4.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Topographical Engineers:

GENERAL: I ascended at 3.45 this p.m. but have nothing new to report. The enemy remain about as usual. It would be a good time for some one to ascend at Mechanicsville, but I am not able to ride there myself, and Mr. Allen is quite ill.

The atmosphere is quite clear, but the earth is heavily shaded by clouds.

Your very obedient servant,

T. S. C. LOWE,

Chief Aeronaut.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 11, 1862.

Professor LOWE:

SIR: The commanding general desires you to make an ascension this evening, if but for a few moments, to try you can see anything of a large body of the enemy, said to be in the vicinity of Old Tavern, near Mrs. Price's house.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
