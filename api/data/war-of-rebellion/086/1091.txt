manding general is anxious that this brigade should remain in winter quarters and not be removed except in case of great emergency. The Brigade does not belong to the District of Arkansas but to the command of General Maxey, and if removed must be ordered back as soon as the necessity for its presence in Arkansas ceases to exist. You should communicate constantly with General Maxey that you may mutually assist each other. The general commanding also directs me to say that he is uncertain from the tenor of your letter of the 26th ultimo whether you have yet ordered Wharton's cavalry to Texas, if not, he directs that it be done at once in conformity with previous instructions.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant-Adjutant-General.
