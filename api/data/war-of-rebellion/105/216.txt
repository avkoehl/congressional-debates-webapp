miles. We are now distant from Placerville about twenty-five miles in a northwest direction, having made a detour to the westward from the main trail by passing down the west side of Payette Valley until we reach the ferry across main Payette River, crossing at or near that point. I made this change of route from my original intention in order to avoid the mountain dividing the Payette and Boise Rivers, which at this point is represented to me as being in a very bad condition, and the grass and water very scarce. I expect to reach Boise River in four or five days, but at what particular point cannot now precisely state. Have as yet met with no Indians, nor any evidence of their proximity. The health of the command continues good, and the animals in as good condition generally as when we left Lapwai. For a more full report of the command I have the honor to refer you to the accompanying field return for the last ten days of June, which is without alteration this date.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. F. MAURY,

Colonel, Commanding.

SIR: I have the honor to report the arrival of my command at this place to-day, having marched 250 miles, estimated, from Fort Lapwai. This distance might have been reduced to 225 miles, and rafting Payette River, opposite Bonny Valley, obviated, by continuing down the west bank of Lakr or Middle Fork from the point where the trail first crosses it, six miles southwest of Fish Lake. The health of my command continues good, and the animals are in as good condition as could be expected.

HDQRS. EXPEDITION AGAINST THE SNAKE INDIANS,Camp Numbers 24, on Boise River, Idaho Ter., July 13, 1863.

SIR: I have been joined by Companies H and I, First Washington Territory Infantry, the strength of which you will see from the returns, and am now waiting for the necessary outfit, the supplies not having as yet arrived. In consequence of the scarcity and difficulty of procuring the means of transportation, I have determined to establish a depot at some eligible point between this and Fort Hall, from which I can send back a portion of our train for such additional supplies as I may require. The health of the command is as yet good, but I fear the consequence of much delay in camp, both upon its health and morale. Emigrants (two parties) from Missouri arrived yesterday. They report having seen Indians on Camas Prairie and beyond, though making no demonstration of hostilities. They also say that General Connor has been disappointed in his arrangements with the Indians;
