Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that my First and Third Divisions are now in position here, and both officers and men are in fine spirits. I am pleased to inform you that three days' supply for my command arrived here last night. I have sent (through General Brannan) to advise General Palmer of this. Perhaps information through General Thomas would reach him more promptly. I would suggest that a few couriers be ordered to report to me, to effect sure and prompt communication with department headquarters.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
