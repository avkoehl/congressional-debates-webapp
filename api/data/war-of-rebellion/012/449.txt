siderably inferior to that of the rebels, who still fight well, but I will do all I can with the force at my disposal.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, Williamsburg, Va., May 6, 1862.

I have the pleasure to announce the occupation of this place as the result of the hard-fought action of yesterday. The effect of Hancock's brilliant engagement yesterday afternoon was to turn the left of their line of works. He was strongly re-enforced, and the enemy abandoned the entire position during the night, leaving all his sick and wounded in our hands. His loss yesterday was very severe. We have some 300 uninjured prisoners and more than 1,000 wounded. Their loss in killed is heavy. The victory is complete. I have sent cavalry in pursuit, but the roads are in such condition that I cannot move artillery nor supplies. I shall therefore push the other movement most energetically. The conduct of our men has been excellent, with scarcely an exception. The enemy's works are very extensive and exceedingly strong, both in respect to their position and the works themselves. Our loss was heavy in Hooker's division, but very little on other parts of the field. Hancock's success was gained with a loss of not over 20 killed and wounded. Weather good to-day, but great difficulty in getting up food on account of the roads. Very few wagons have yet come up.

Am I authorized to follow the example of other generals, and direct names of battle to be placed on the colors of regiments? We have other battles to fight before reaching Richmond.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

WILLIAMSBURG, May 6, 1862.

Every hour proves our victory more complete. Enemy's loss great; especially in officers. Have just heard of five more of their guns captured. Prisoners constantly arriving.
