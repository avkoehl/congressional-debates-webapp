In all these States we find indications of
depressed business and increased pecuniary
loss. In States engaged both in agriculture
and manufactures, increased failures are man-
ifested amid diversified industry and an im-
mediate home market for produce with high
protective duties. The northwestern agri-
cultural States exhibit failures in 18G9 nearly
double those of the former year. If these
failures are attributable to a deranged cur-
rency or a shrinkage in estimated values,
rather than taxation, as some may contend,
still heavy burdens imposed by the Government
for revenue augment the evil, andtheirremoval
would help alleviate the financial distress.
The collection of $87,000,000 surplus rev-
enue, applied to discharge the debt, was a dim-
inution of the capital possessed by each per-
son to the extentof the tax ho paid. True, he
was. actually no poorer since what he paid to
reduce the common burden would, if the tax
were equally assessed, pay but his share to-
ward the discharge of the public debt; yet for
present use and enjoyment ho has in actual
possession as much loss capital as the sum he
has paid. While other causes are reducing
gains and even impairing capital, it will be
hard to satisfy the people that the Govern-
ment ought further to embarrass business and
lessen incomes and the rewards of labor by
extra taxation to pay off indebtedness not yet
matured.
But if the revenue frQjn customs can safely
be diminished $83,000,000, where shall the
reduction be made? What industry is most
depressed ? What dutiable articles are required
for that industry more than for others, so that
the least reduction will afford the greatest re-
lief? How can the amount required for the
sinking fund and interest on the debt be appor-
tioned so that each person who ought to con-
tribute shall pay his just proportion? Whatis
the share and how shall it be adjusted so that
each individual and each section of the Com-
monwealth shall sustain the burden alike?
These questions present themselves at the
threshold of any intelligent discussion of the
subject.
The warrant and guide for Federal taxation
must be found in the Constitution. It is there
expressly granted in clear and unmistakable
language:
" The Congress shall have power to lay and collect
taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts
and provide for the common defense and general
welfare of the United States."
But not less clearly and explicitly is indi-
cated the object for such taxation and the rule
of assessment. In order to secure equality
of contribution from the different sections of
the Union apportionment of direct taxation
was restricted to the basis of representative
population. Financial ability, resources, ex-
tent of protection afforded by the Government
were not to be regarded; simply numbers and
representation. Equality of apportionment in
case of direct, and uniformity of rate in case
of indirect taxation, is the constitutional lim-
itation. Uniformity of rate is apparently re-
quired for the purpose of securing as far as
practicable equality of contribution "through-
out the United States."
A tax upon imports may affect the members
of the community in two ways—as a burden
and as a benefit. Whatever enhancement of
price it may occasion to tho home consumer
is a burden upon him. If all that he thus pays
goes in the Treasury it is a benefit, and if his
tax is no more than the share of the national
expenses that he ought to pay, the benefit
equals the burden, if but a part goes into the
Treasury tho benefit does not accrue, at least
directly, to the tax-payer, but is shared between
him and the person or community receiving
the balance of the tax. Taxation by duties on
imports may be unequal in its burdens and its
benefits. When tho duties are imposed upon
articles of universal consumption the tax lalls
upon all parts of tho country.
To secure equality of taxation wo certainly
should consider whether tho consumption of
the dutiable articles is general or local. Is the
Treasury enriched by receiving tho whole tax
that tho consumer pays ? If the use of tho
dutiable article is universal, the tax paid by
the consumer will be distributed throughout
the United States. A largo portion of the cus-
toms received is now collected from artielesof
general consumption, that secure to the Gov-
ernment the whole tax paid by the consumer.
Where duties are imposed upon articles of ex-
clusive foreign production all the tax inures to
the benefit of the tax-payer. It goes to sup-
port the Government and reduce its debt. In
the case of duties upon articles of domestic and
foreign production where the price is enhanced
it is different. Only that portion of the tax paid
by the consumer goes into the Treasury which
is paid upon the foreign article. The home
producer diverts to himself from the Treasury
all of the tax that the Government would have
received if the home product had been imported.
Taxation is not lightened although the revenue
is diminished. There may be and generally is
a gain to the domestic producer of the taxed
commodity ; but the benefit usually is partial
and local, while the tax is general and falls
upon the whole community. The advantage
accruing at first to the industry itself may ex-
tend to other dependent local industries and to
the profits of capital invested therein, and oven
benefit the agriculturists of the vicinity ; but
it is local as to the section of country, and
•thus partial and unfair to other portions of the
Union.
Now, there are three ways at least of correct-
ing this inequality; first, the imposition of du-
ties solely upon articles exclusively of foreign
growth and production; second, tho extension
of this tariff to duties upon the import of such
articles of foreign and domestic production as
are common to all parts of the union; third,
sueh adjustment of the tariff upon imports of
articles which are of limited and sectional home
production that the benefit to one section and
industry of the Union shall be compensated by
an equal benefit to every other section and
industry.
It seems to me that a tariff framed without
reference to one of these principles cannot avoid
being unjust and oppressive to some of the
industries of the Union, and is not within the
spirit and intent of the constitutional limitation
of the taxing power.
I shall not enter upon the discussion of the
question as to whether the duty is paid by the
foreign producer or domestic consumer, or botn.
In some instances it doubtless falls wholly upon
the consumer, in other cases wholly upon the
foreign producer—usually is shared in greater
or less proportion between them. If a farmer)
havin* the choice of two cities to which he
couldlake his farm products, as, for instance,
his butter, were charged a tax of 2 cents a
pound for all he sold in one city, he would
charge the citizens of the taxing city 2 cento
a pound more for butter, and they would pay
the tax. But if the latter refused to buy at the
increased price he would take all his buttei
to the other city, where, perhaps in consequence
of the increased quantity offered there the price
would fall; but whatever the price, it would
always be :2 cents lower in the free than in the
taxing city. But if the supply of butter was
not in excess of the demand in the free city,
citizens of the taxing city would pay the addi-
tional 2 cents or get no butter.
The advocates of a tariff for protection with-
out regard to revenue, that is of a tariff framed
to lessen foreign competition and prevent im-
portations, insist that the foreign producer
pays the duty. It is needless to dispute the
proposition. ' If true, I claim that a duty which
restricts or prevents foreign competition is a
benefit to the domestic producer of the taxed
article, and that in the adjustment of a tariff
for revenue the special benefits or protection
shall accrue to all sections of the Union; that
a few industries and interests shall not be se-
lected as deserving of consideration and others
ignored and neglected; that care should be
exercised to benefit every section and industry;
that its incidental protection should extend to
mining, agriculture, commerce, and even fish-
eries, as well as to "domestic manufactures."
A resolution was introduced and passed this
House without consideration or debate, read-
ing as follows:
"Resolved, That tho interests of the country re-
quire such tariff for revenue upou foreign imports as
will afford incidental protection to domestic manu-
facture^ and as will, without impairing the revenue,
impose the lowest burden imjoii and 'best promote
and eneourase tho great industrial interests of the
oountry."
While it properly admits that revenue is the
object of the duty and protection incidental,
it restricts the protection to domestic manu-
factures.
Sir, there are other industries in this country
besides domestic manufactures that are entitled
to consideration in the distribution of the inci-
dental protection and special benefits that may
be secured through restrictive duties. Gen-
tlemen representing constituencies whose peo-
ple are interested in the production of iron,
salt, and manufactured goods have presented
to us their views in relation to the duty of Con-
gress in adjusting the tariff. They have been
faithful to their constituents, and" earnest in
the advocacy of congressional protection for
their interests and section. But when they
claim to speak in the exclusive interest of
American labor and American progress. I
deny the assumption. American labor is not
engrossed in one pursuit or confined to one
section. It is as wide as the continent, as
extensive as all the vocations and enterprises
which demand the muscle or brain of the
nation or the skill and toil of its citizens. Is
there no industry besides domestic manufac-
tures ; are there no laborers but the workmen
and artisans engaged therein ?
^ The American laborer is not only the worker
in iron and metals, in cloths and textile fab-
rics, nor is he found only delving in mines or
haininering at the forge or anvil, or plying the
needle or shuttle amid the hum of machinery
'n ®aste™ factories; he is also in the open
held behind the plow, spreading the canvas
upon the sea, in the workshop fashioning the
finished product of the manufacturer to the
particular wants of individuals. He is in the
