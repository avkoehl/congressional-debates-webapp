Brigadier-General CRAWFORD,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: I have just returned from examining our left and find my proposed arrangements very incomplete as yet, and anticipate an effort of the enemy to press us back to-morrow morning. I wish, therefore, you would have Colonel Carle's brigade under arms by 3 a.m., prepared to sustain Colonel Lyle, and moving out in that direction at that time. I shall also have a brigade from Ayres in the vicinity a little later and be there myself. I then mean to put all the axes I have at work by means of these two brigades, and put the ground around Colonel Lyle in the right condition. If necessary, I shall drive the enemy's skirmishers in. Let Colonel Carle's men have their breakfast and dinner with them. You had best, I think, be at hand yourself in person to-morrow morning early on the left. After to-morrow I shall have affairs all snug.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
