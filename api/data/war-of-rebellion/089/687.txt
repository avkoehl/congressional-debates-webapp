versation with him nothing could be elicited to show that any troops whatever had been sent from General Lee's army about Petersburg southward. An effort was made to learn if there were indications of any such movement, but nothing could be detected. They say in Richmond that Kershaw's division has been bright down because the enemy expect another attack by us on the north side, and our friends send us word that such is really the opinion. More than ordinary care is observed on the north side; the pickets there have been strengthened; additional and extraordinary rules have been added to prevent the ingress and egress of unreliable persons. Nothing is known in Richmond concerning Sherman, his progress, or whereabouts, except the meager information afforded by the newspapers. Richmond papers of yesterday are forwarded.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, November 23, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Deserters from the following commands have arrived at this office to-day: Two from Lane's brigade; two from Ransom's brigade; two from Wise's brigade. Five of them have been in the service less than two months, and one from Ransom's brigade has been in the army about three years. They report no changes in the enemy's position. The man to whom General Hancock alludes could not have arrived, as none of these men report any late movement of the enemy.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. McENTEE,

Captain, &c.
