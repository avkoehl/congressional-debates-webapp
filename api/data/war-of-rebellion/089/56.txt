HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 3, 1864-11.10 a. m. (Received 11.15 a. m.)

General HUMPHREYS:

It is reported that some 100 men have this morning moved from the line in my front toward our left. The signal officer saw 300. Captain Harn, artillery officer, thinks about 600 moved. I have sent down on the line for reports of all movements observed.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 3, 1864-12 m.

Major-General MEADE:

GENERAL: I have just come from telescope on top of Avery house. the second line of the enemy's works is filled with troops. The small parties which left the front line about 9 o'clock went to the rear to the encampment, but from there they could not be seen to pass. It has been the habit heretofore to put in the front line at one hour before daylight all the convalescents, militia from the town, and relieve them at 9 a. m. This may be the case now. The movement was by squads and in full sight, which was unusual. The tents of the enemy are up in the second line. General Miles, on our right, has been watching on his lines, but says he observes no changes.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 3, 1864. (Received 5.40 p. m.)

General HUMPHREYS:

Major Walsh, commanding the battalion Third Pennsylvania Cavalry, says his pickets at the junction of stage and City Point roads were fired on again at 1 p. m. Colonel Collis says this point is on the extreme left of Major Walsh's line, and is on the road mostly used by the enemy's scouts, and thinks it should be guarded from City Point.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 3, 1864-6.50 p. m.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

The junction of the stage road and City Point road is about one mile and a half from Prince George Court-House and at least four miles from Old Court-House. There is no cavalry at City Point to send there. A detachment of Major Walsh's cavalry at that junction and one toward Mount Sinai Church would watch the main avenues of approach, which is all that can be done in that direction.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
