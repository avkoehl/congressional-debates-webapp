HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 15, 1862-7 p.m.

General GEORGE STONEMAN, Poolesville, Md.:

General Halleck telegraphs to-day that there are additional indications that the enemy is preparing for another raid or a more general movement, and that the impression is that he will attempt to cross the Potomac below the Point of Rocks. The commanding general directs that you have the river upon your line well watched and guarded. Our signal officer on Maryland Heights, with a powerful telescope, saw what he took to be the camp of about a division of troops a little east of Leesburg this afternoon.

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

Major-General BANKS, Commanding, &amp;c.,:

GENERAL: I have but a single suggestion to make upon the report of dispositions sent in last night. I am told that there are several fords between High [Great] Falls and Seneca Creek. If so, they should be well guarded with artillery and infantry, if you can spare the forces.

Very respectfully,

H. W. HALLECK,
