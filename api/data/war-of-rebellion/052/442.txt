festly unjust that they should only receive the pay of privates, and it will detract much from the efficiency of the regiments if this is to be so.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, Trenton, Ga., September 8, 1863.

(Received 3.15 p.m., 9th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,General-in-Chief:

Information to-night leads to the belief that the enemy had decided not to fight us at Chattanooga. Our reconnoitering to-day shows that he has withdrawn his pickets on Lookout Mountain, opposite and below us. Our troops are moving into Stevens', Frick's, and Winston's Gaps. McCook and Stanley start to-morrow with advance to reconnoiter toward Broomtown Valley, and Crittenden to gain the summit of Lookout, south of Chattanooga, with a reconnaissance in force, holding his corps ready to enter the place, if practicable, Granger closed up to Stevenson and Bridgeport with four brigades.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

WHITESIDE'S STATION, September 8, 1863-11 p.m.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

SIR: Your order to abandon Wauhatchie line received. I am here with office to-night. Will open office at General Crittenden's headquarters soon as possible in the morning.

Very respectfully,

J. C. VAN DUZER.
HEADQUARTERS ANDERSON CAVALRY, Camp near Trenton, September 8, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. GODDARD,Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: By direction of the general commanding, I have the honor to inform you that there are no pickets at G and P on this sketch,* and at no other points on these roads nearer than General Crittenden's picket posts. Infantry pickets should be posted there.

I have picketed with my cavalry the roads leading from the Nickajack and McKaig traces. I have a courier post on the Trenton and Chattanooga road, about a mile beyond G, but there should be an infantry picket at G, which could also guard P.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

WM. J. PALMER,

Colonel, Commanding.
