Not more than one caisson will move with each battery, and those will be divested of two ammunition-chests which will be put where they can be easily replaced on the carriages.

IV. One ambulance will accompany each battery.

V. The Georgia battalion will move after dark to a pontoon near Mr. Ruffin's.

VI. On the return of the artillery Colonel Daniel will be in readiness with his brigade to move in advance, and Colonel Manning will follow the artillery as soon as it shall pass him.

VII. All noise, all fires, and approach during the day when a soldier can be seen by the enemy is forbidden, the whole being a secret expedition.

The command reached Petersburg by sunset July 29. General D. H. Hill, commanding, having been reported to early in the day by telegram and later by a member of my staff, sent forward for the purpose, we encamped that evening a short distance beyond the city, on the Suffolk road.
