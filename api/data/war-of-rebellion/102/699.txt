HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF ARKANSAS,Little Rock, Ark., May 31, 1865. (Received 10 p. m.)

ADJUTANT-GENERAL OF THE ARMY:

There are now on the rolls of this department about 20,000 effective men, including 4,500 colored troops. We require for the present to garrison the depots about 14,000, which number can be gradually diminished. White River country requires about 2,500 men. Arkansas, including railroad and Fort Gibson, about 9,000. Camden and other points in the south part of this State, say Washington or Fulton, about 2,500. The terms of service of the white troops in the department expire before September 30, and their muster-out is suspended until they can be replaced by other troops. This replacement is recommended, and should take place at once, as the fact of the existence of orders entitling them to muster-out cannot be kept from the troops, and impartial treatment is essential to harmony. This department daily filling up with predatory bands and stragglers, rendering immediate and prompt action necessary. Will send complete lists by mail. No account is herein taken of Alexandria and Shreveport, which must soon be garrisoned.

J. J. REYNOLDS,

Major-General.
