APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[December 1,
3Gth Cong. ... 2d Sess.
Report of the Postmaster General.
Senate & Ho. of Eeps.
Although the number of letters conveyed by
mail during the last year has increased by many
millions, (as shown by the increased revenue of
over five hundred thousand dollars,) yet the whole
number of dead letters, so far from increasing,
has rather diminished. From this fact, it may be
concluded that better attention than formerly is
now given to the delivery of letters, and that the
new regulations on the subject have had a salu-
tary effect.
Tf the proper assistance could be obtained,
further improvements might, no doubt, be made;
and I therefore again bog leave to urge the pro-
priety of authorizing the employment of tempo-
rary clerks to make the experiment with the dead
letteis, somewhat according to the plans proposed
in my special report of May 7, 1860. (Senate
Ex. Doc,, No. 41, Thirty-Sixth Congress, 1st
session.) It might, perhaps, be sufficient for the
present, simply to authonze.the use of the dead-
letter money, (which cannot be restored to the
owners,) including what has heretofore accrued
and that to accrue in future, or so much of it as
may be necessary for the improvement of this
branch of business.
The new law concerning the return of letters
upon which the names and post offices of the wri-
ters were indorsed, was communicated specially
to all postmasters; but, as yet, it seems to have
been measurably inoperative.
It is the duty of the Postmaster General to
enforce the prompt rendition of the quarterly
accounts of postmasters, and refer them to the
Auditor for examination and adjustment. On the
30th June last, there were inoperation 28,498 post
offices, making the number of accounts to be han-
dled in a year 113,396. Their bulk is such that
over four hundred three-bushel sacks arc required
to contain the accounts of a single quarter. The
post bills (weighing alone between forty and fifty
thousand pounds each quarter) have to be sepa-
rated from the transcripts, and stored in regular
order for reference; and the dead letters counted
and compared with their bills. Then the accounts
arc registered and immediately transferred to the
Auditor's office. Out of the whole number of post
offices (28,498) only two hundred and" fifty-eight
failed to make returns for the quarter ended 30th
June last.
The dead letters, which number over five hun-
dred thousand a quarter, are carefully opened,
and those with inclosures of value registered and I
returned to the owners. j
The laborconnected with the accounts and dead
letters has increased over fifty per ccnt. within
ten years. Ten thousand new post offices have
been established, and the number of valuable dead
letters sent out has increased from sixteen to
twenty-four thousand annually.
Another branch of business, involving much
labor and responsibility, is the preparation of war-
rants and drafts in payment of balances reported
by the Auditor to be due the mail contractors and
others each quarter.
This involves the keeping of summary cash
accounts with 8 United States depositaries, 29
other depositaries, (in post offices,) 842 draft
offices, and 993 depositing offices. At the depos-
itary and draft offices, $3,237,777 (being over two
thirds) of the net revenues of the Department
were concentrated, and then disbursed during the
year ending 30th June last, the remainder of the
net revenue having been collected by mail eon-
tractors, on orders prepared and sent out from
the Auditor's office.
On the 33th June, 1880, there were.. 7,445 mail contractors.

] 860 *24,000
Number of drafts and \vair«'ints> is-

Increase  8.000, or 50 per cent.
Before making payments, all the calculations
of the Auditor's office aie verified, and noted eaeh
quartei, fur which purpose summary accounts
are required to be kept for all of the 8,500 mail
routes, and the various calculations and entries
thus amount to 17,000 each quarter. This large
amount of extra work has been found necessary
since 1854.
The branch of business, however, which has
most rapidly grown, is that connected with the
postage stamps and stamped envelopes.
The use of stamps commenced in 1847; and be-
tween 1st July of that year and 30th June, 1851,
there were issued 891,000 of the ten-cent denom-
ination, and 3,712,200 of the fivc-cent denomina-
tion, equal to $274,710.
Under the act of 3d March, 1851, reducing post-
agr s and favoring prepayment, the issues were,
for the year ending 30th June, 1852:
1-cent  5,002,400
3-cent 45,9^7,900
12-com  137,750
Equal to $1,446,170.
For the year ending 30th June last, there were
issued—
l-ccnt  50,723,400
3-cent....  159,463,600
5-cent  579.360
10-cent  3,898,450
12-cent  1,653,500
24-cent  52,350
Equal to $5,920,939 00
Stamped envelopes were intioduced in 1853,
and the issues during tlie last year amounted
to    949,377 19
Total of postage stamps and stamped en-
velopes $6,870,31G J9
being an increase in eight years of $5,424,14G 19.
in the year 1852, the number of orders for
stamps was 9,200. In 1860, the orders for stamps
and stamped envelopes were, in round numbers,
80,000, or near 900 per cent, increase. The aver-
age number of orders now requiring attention
each day is above 225. Each separate order is
"compared with the ledger, and the date and amount
of stamps and envelopes previously furnished are
noted, so as to guard against over supplies.
Next, the revenue of the post office is ascertained,
and the amount to be sent is apportioned and
noted accordingly. In the third place, the .several
orders arc registered, and then charged on the
ledgers to each office.
Receipts corresponding to the number of orders
filled arc daily received and entered on the regis-
ters, and then filed until the end of the quarter,
when they are leferred to the Auditor, to be reg-
ulaily charged in the adjustment of the postmas-
ters' accounts.
The duties described, connectcd with postage
stamps and stamped envelopes, are of the very
first importance—being at the foundation of al-
most the entire revenues of the Post Office De-
partment—and require for their performance the
closest application,combined with strict vigilance
and nil the best qualifications of an accountant.
In 1852, the number of clerks on the various
duties of the finance office, as above described,
was seventeen. The present number allowed by
law is twenty-five, an increase which is insuffi-
cient for the work connectcd with receiving and
referring the accounts of postmasters, examining
dead letters, and with disbursements of the reve-
nue, leaving entirely out of view the distribution
of postage stamps and stamped envelopes, which
business has so rapidly advanced to its present
magnitude since 1852, as already shown. At
that period it was managed by one single clerk;
now, at least nine clerks arc required.
In the other branches, various improvements
have been introduced, which, together with the
growth of the business, makes additional force
necessary. At present, the work is accomplished
by the aid of temporary clerks, who are engaged
in the distribution of stamps, and paid out of the
appropriation for that purpose; and by using as
clerks persons who are employed and paid out
ot the appropriation for laborers. It is, however,
submitted that such a state of things should not
continue, and that Congress should make provis-
ion tor an additioifto the regular corps of clerks
sufficient to meet the absolute demands of the
public service. Accordingly, I recommend that
the following additional clerks be authorized; |
one of class three, at $^,600 per annum; five of '
class two, at $1,400 per annum; five of class one,
at §1,200 per annum—in all, eleven; being,
however, an additidn of only two to the numeri-
cal force now actually in service, taking into ac-
count six temporary clerks, and three laborers
employed as clerks.
