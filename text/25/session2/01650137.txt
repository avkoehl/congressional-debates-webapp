States. Bfr. C was as ranch opposed as any man,
to any violation of the rights of -the Indians 01 oí
the United States, and would go foi the amendment
-with a proper modification. He would, therefore,
before the question on the amendment was taken,
submit an amendment to the text of the bill, which
he hoped would be acceptable to the Senator from
Tennessee, and -would obviate the necessity of
his amendment. Mr C then moved to amend
the bill by inserting a proviso that it bhall not apply
to any lands to which the Indian title has not been
extinguished six months
Mr. CLAY ot Kentucky said he rose  o thank
the Senator from Tennessee (Mr White) for the
suggestions thrown out, and embraced by the
amendment offered, and they were the more gra-
tifying, coming, as they did, lrom so distinguished
a source as the head of the Committee on Indian
Affairs The object of the amendment (if he un-
derstood it correctly) was to secure from intrusion
lands not settled by treaty
He (Mr. C ) would ask the Senator from Mis-
sissippi what became of his argument in lavor of
the brll, if the amendment suggested by the Sena-
tor from Alabama prevailed1 The Senator from
Mississippi says that his bill precludes from pre-
emption all those who have settled on the public
lands prior to the extinction of the Indian title'
while the other seeks to include those m the rights
who had settled there «n anticipation of such an
event, by invitation from the Indians themselves—
a bargain made with Indians m anticipation of the
surrender If such a sjstem were to prevail,
where would it stop? Who vías there that d'd not
anticipate the extinct on, in process of time, ot the
Indian title to the whole w ide range of land to the
Pacific itself He hoped that all trespasses on the
public land, or Indian lands would be prevented
These pre-emptions-were mere struggles to get pos-
session ol the public domain, and had ever a ten-
dency to violate the rights of the Indians Let us
at least, (said Mr. C ) if we cannot protect the
public property from lawless intrusion, endeavor to
protect the poor Indians, whose rights we were so
solemnly pledged to shield from aggression.
Mr. CLAY of Alabama said he was as much
opposed to the violation of treaties, or of Indian
rights, as the Senator from Kentucky, or anj other
man, and would be ihe last man to give any sanc-
tion to it. But he denied that m the case of the
Alabama settlers any injury had been done to the
Indians or *he Government He was under the
impression that individuals had been parmitted,
under the authority of the officers of Government,
to occupy the improvements they purchased from
the Indians.
Mr N1LES made a few observations in favor of
the amendment of the Senator from Tennessee, and
condemnatory of the practice of intruding on the
lands of the Indians
Mr KING of Alabama defended the officers of
Government (certifying agents, &e ) from the im-
plications of the Senator from Tennessee He had
taken great pains to inform himself, and he was
satisfied that, with one exception only, a more
faithful, vigilant, and efficient set of officers never
were m the public service One of the certifying
agents had been dismissed for improper conduct,
and the certifying of another had been set aside on
the ground that he had been imposed on by persons
bribing Indians not entitled, to personate those who
were entitled, to reservations. He was sorry that
hts friend from Tennessee had Ihought proper to
make such sweeping denunciations, as he was satis-
fied that the officers were vigilant, faithful, and ef-
ficient While up he would take occasion to say
tnat, in general, it was a very good rulo that an in-
dividual should not get a pre-emption in conse-
quence of his having encroached on the Indian
lands. But if they adhered stnct'y 'o that rule in
a pre-emption law, many an individual, whose
claim was meritorious, would be excluded
Mr. WHITE said that these frauds «ere spoken
of by an agent of the Government He hoped they
•were not so numerous as had been repre^en'ed
He would be glad 10 exempt the persons by name
from participation in any such dee !s That frauds
have been committed, of á most gross and sicken-
mg nature, there cowlcLbe no doubt.   Not only had
thev induced one poor Indian to personate anothei
Indian in the purchase ot the e reservations, but
had taken the lands, in many instance , for the pal-
try sum of ten dolíais, and even ¡hit was taken
from them when they left th1 eei lifting office He
believed it before, an I still believed it, that tht se
frauds were on a much larger scale than was gene-
rally supposed In the first instance, one set of
agen's had been sent to cetttfy, and then another t >
examine the certificates, and last, a board ol ci m-
missioncrs had been appointed, that had alreayd
been m session some two or three years, without
giving us any thing authentic, and when trie}
would, God only knew He had said, and still
maintained, that the main cause of uird'sturbince^
grew out ot (he corrupt practices o* ihe agents that
had been sent among these people, and w ere no1
owing to the reservations, as had been afhrraed It
was alwajs painful to him to advert to such things,
and he would not v oluntanly hav e m'roduced the to-
pic Hisremarks had grown out of ihe ob^-ei vations
oftheSenatorfromA!abama,(Mr Ch3,)on!h< que-*
tion whether the amendment ought to provide tb it
no man should have a pre-emption right who hnd
settled on lands pnoi to the time the. Indian tule
had been extinguished He thought it became the
Senate especially to set its (ice against the v i >la
tion of any treaty or stipulation with the Indians
Mr TIPTON said that he should vote foi the
amendment offered by the Senaior Ocm Tennes-
see, (Mr White,) prohibiting the granting of p-e-
emption rights to settlers on the public lands, w ho
had settled and made improvements on lands owned
by the Indnn  He thought we owed it to mr
own reputation, as well as to the solemn obligation
of our treaties with ti ese people, to protect the
rights of the Indians, and those who entered
and made improvements on their lands, had no
right to expeel a pieemption, oven if those lands
have since b en puichased iioin the India\,
Sir, (said Mr 1 ) I cm lot \ ott foi the tmeiid-
ment of the honorable Semtoi from Alabama,
(Mr Cuy,) piohibitmg pic-emp'ions on lands that
were not purchased from the Indians more than
six months before ihe first of December last, and it
is proper that I should state my reasons for this
vote They are these m 1834 a tieaty was nego-
tiated with the Miami Indians in Indiana, by v hich
they ceded a portion of the most valuable lands m
that State, situated on thf line of our canal, near
to our flourishing villages, but the President
of the United Stales refused his sanction to
that treaty at that time He placed it in the hands of
a commissioner, with instructions to obtain the con
sent of the Indians to the modifications It has been
modified, and the Senate will recollect tint this
treaty was ratified at the late extra session of ihe
Senate in Octobei last He had lead and pre-
sented to the Senate petitions lrom citi/ens of
Miami county, Indiana, asking Congies* to pass.
a pre-empt on law He did not pretend to say that
these petitioners were entitled to pre-emption 01
that Congress should permit pre emption on
these valuable lands, but he could not vote
to prevent his own constituents, /us own nngltbmi,
from the benefits extended to others The State
would probably ask Congress to srant her all these
lands at #1 25 per acre, to aid hei m constructing
her public works He was in favor of giving the
State those lands on the terms he had indicated,
but he could not vote to take away the. supposed
right of the persons referred to, though he did not
believe then case a very strong one
Mr CLAY of Alabama said, whit- he was en-
deavoring to defend one right, he was not aware
that he would be trenching upon others, he would
withdraw his amendment
Mr SMITH of Indiana expressed his regret
that the amendment should have been withdrawn,
and he should feel compelled to renew the motion
He had a high respect l< r the feeUngs which
actuated his colleague in relation to these srtiieis
many ol whom were also his (Mr S\) filends, but
he v as impelled b> a higher consideration, to wi>
the duty he owe! hts State Mr S here went
