HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 30, 1863-9.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The enemy appear the same in my front. Their rifle-pits are full of men. My skirmishers advanced some distance to the front, but could not draw their fire. We took some 12 prisoners, of Hill's corps.

Very respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 30, 1863-11.30 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

If I could have four 4 1/2-inch guns I could silence the batteries bearing on Warren's right and my front. A staff officer will show a fine road to the position if the guns can be given me. The enemy's fire in my front is in a crochet, thus:

Respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.

P. S.-In co-operation I can carry the position as it now stands in my front.

[General BIRNEY:]

GENERAL: In compliance with instructions from headquarters Army of the Potomac, there will be a general assault along the entire line of the enemy at 8 a.m., at which time all of the batteries will open their fire. At 7 a.m. you will deploy one brigade of your division as skirmishers, the left extending to where the left of our main line now is, and the right to the left of the First Corps. These troops will be placed so as not to expose them to the fire of our own main line now is, and the right to the left of the First Corps. These troops will be placed so as not to expose them to the fire of our own shells or those of the enemy. The other two brigades will be deployed as supports, ready to advance as soon as the attack on the enemy's flank becomes successful. Every train and encampment must be moved back to Robertson's Tavern, or be put out of reach of the enemy's shelling.

By command of Major-General French:

O. H. HART,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Assistant Adjutant-General.
