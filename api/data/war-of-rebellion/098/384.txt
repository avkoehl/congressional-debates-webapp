Bridge and thence down the River road to within about three miles of the Wilmington and Weldon Railroad, and on the following morning moved across the Neuse RIVER into Goldsborough.

For more detailed statements I respectfully refer to reports of division commanders. A tabulated return is appended.

I cannot close this report without calling the attention oft e commanding general to the efficiency displayed by my division commanders. Major General J. A. Mower, commanding First Division, is deserving of great praise for the skill shown in crossing the Salkehatchie, South Ediston, and Pedee Rivers. Brigadier General M. F. Foce, commanding THIRD Division, at the North Edisto displayed his usual ability, and Bvt. Major General G. A. Smith, at Broxton's Bridge, on the Salkehatchie, and at Fayetteville, deserves special mention. I desire specially to mention Lieutenant Colonel S. T. Hughes, commanding Ninth Illinois Mounted Infantry. He, with his command, made several brilliant charges d was always ready for any service required. To Lieutenant- Colonel Hickenlooper, assistant inspector- general, of my staff, a brave and gallant officer, my thanks are due for the efficient manner in which he performed any duty required. Lieutenant Colonel D. T. Kirby, Twenty- seventeenth Missouri Volunteers, of my staff, was wounded in a charge on the enemy at Salkehatchie River and was taken to the rear. By this accident I lost the services of a gallant and efficient officer. Cap C. Cadle, Jr., adjutant- general, on my staff, deserves great praise for the manner in which he has discharged the duties of that most important and responsible position, and I have recommended him for promotion to the rank of lieutenant- colonel on account of the ability, zeal, and fidelity which he has displayed. To all of my staff I am indebted for their cheerful and prompt discharge of duty in the several positions held by them.

Respectfully,

FRANK P. BLAIR, JR.,

Major- General, Commanding Seventeenth Army Corps.

Captain A.m. VAN DYKE,

Asst. Adjt. General Army and Department of the Tennessee.
