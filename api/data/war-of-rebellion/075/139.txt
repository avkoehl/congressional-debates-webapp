General McPHERSON, Sugar Valley:

GENERAL: The indications are that Johnston is evacuating Dalton. In that event Howard and the cavalry will pursue, and all the rest will follow your note. I will be down early in the morning. Try and strike him if possible about the forks of the road. Hooker must be with you now, and you might send Garrard to threaten Rome and that flank. I will cause the lines all to be left at once.
