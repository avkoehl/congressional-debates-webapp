The movement will be made with the utmost dispatch and secrecy. Arriving at Hernando the town will be surrounded and every man in it arrested,and certain persons will be brought in as prisoners, who will be pointed out by the guide who will be sent to you. Any other upon whom any suspicion may rest of being connected with the guilty parties will also be arrested. The officer will return with his command with all convenient speed. He will be careful that he suffers no damage to be done to the persons or property of peaceable citizens. He will carefully note all movements of the enemy if any be discovered, and will guard well against contact with any superior force. There is no objection to your commanding the expedition in person if you think proper.
