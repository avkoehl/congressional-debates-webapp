GENERAL: General Gregg reports that he has been driven away from Sulphur Springs, and that the enemy are crossing there in large force. There is a regiment of cavalry at Lawson's and Freeman's Fords that should connect with your pickets on the right. They may be driven in in the morning, and you may be attacked. If so, I will immediately support you, but I may also send orders requiring you to fall back. Be ready for either contingency.
