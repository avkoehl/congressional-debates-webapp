Brigadier-General KELLEY, Grafton, Va.;

General Averell has reported, and will proceed on Monday to Weston to relieve Roberts. He will see you by Tuesday morning. Then you can arrange for recalling Kenly's command, and you will have to get back yourself this way. It is my impression we shall soon have business in the Valley. The Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry must return to Elliott as soon as it can be sent. Communicate with Smith, master of transportatioin, Baltimore and Ohio Railroad, for any transportation you may want.

Yes. Put the traitorous and mischievous beyond our lines. I suspect you may have enough to do soon. I shall order back from the west some of your troops. Kelley is directed to send you the Twelfth Pennsylvania Cavalry as soon as it can be done.
