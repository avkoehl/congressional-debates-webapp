ble with the guns at our disposal, the object was with the tete-de-pont to hold the bridge and annoy the enemy on the island, and thus oblige him to keep a large force there. This plan was based upon a reserve of troops at Houston, on the railroad, and at other points commanding the streams leading into Galveston Bay. The troops that were raised for this purpose have been ordered to other fields of action. Under these circumstances Virginia Point and the tete-de-pont became as untenable as the island. The general commanding had hoped that he would have been able to send some troops from this district in the direction of Houston, but the recent demonstration and attacks on the coast have rendered it impossible.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAMUEL BOYER DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
