Major-General THOMAS:

The following telegram received:

KNOXVILLE, TENN., November 17, 1864.

The garrison at Strawberry Plains has not retreated, but the enemy is between us an them, reported in strong force. Skirmished with them this evening near Flat Creek, four miles this side of the Plains, our force finally retiring. May rumors of large force coming from Virginia; nothing reliable.

J. AMMEN,

Brigadier-General.

At thousand mounted men will be concentrated at Crab Orchard by to-morrow or next day, and 2,000 more within three or four days. I have directed General Burbridge not to wait for all his forces to be concentrated, but to push them on by forced marches to Cumberland Gap, where he will find supplies, and to open up communication with Knoxville at the earliest possible moment. In order to mount his men I have authorized him to impress horses. I shall leave for Knoxville to-morrow morning, unless you direct me otherwise.
