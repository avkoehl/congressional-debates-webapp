HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES, Matagorda Island, February 28, 1864.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,Chief of Staff, Department of the Gulf:

This command being now reduced to less than a division, although composed of several detachments, and the troops now here being mostly for fatigue and garrison duty and to hold this island, and there being now present with them two competent general officers, besides myself, viz, Generals Warren and Lawler, and as Major-General Washburn, the permanent commander of the First Division, which composes the greater part of this command, is daily expected, according to private letters received here from him, and also General Benton, who also belongs to this command, being soon due, I desire, as I cannot be of much further use here, to ask to be relieved from duty in the Thirteenth Corps and ordered to report at the headquarters of the department. It is my wish, on reporting at the headquarters of the department, to ask for orders to report elsewhere for duty, to take an active command, preferably farther to the north.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
