he would move th.e previous question. If there
had not been a mistake, and gentlemen were dis-
posed to change the shape of the matter, he would
yield to them to do so.
Mi.M, in reply to a very general call, de-
manded the previous question.
The resolution and amendments were read.
There was a second to the demand for the pre-
vious question, and the mam question was ordered
to be now tak*m; (which main question was first
on Mr. Chandler's proposition.)
Mr. SI EPHEiNS. of Georgia. I will ask; the
House to give me the yeas and nays. I am op-
posed to all investigations of this kind, except
upon charges specifically made.
Mr. EYVING made an inquiry of the Speaker
not heard by tMe reporter.
Mr. JONES. As I do not think that the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means want anything to do
wiiii the matter, I move that the whole subject lie
upon the fable,
Mr. GABLE, of Ohio a^ked the yeas and nays;
which were ordered, and being takfn, resulted
yea-? 96, nays 96; as follow:

So the whole subject was not laid on the table, j
The question recurring on the amendment of j
Mr. Chandler—
All the propositions (on call of Mr. Orr and !
Mr. Stanton of Tennessee) were again read.
A*W some conversation on a point of order— j
Mr. SVVEE I'SER asked the yeas and nays on i
the amendment of Mr. Chandler, I
Mr. OLIR moved that the House adjourn. |
The House tefused to adjourn. |
Mr. JOJSES submitted to the Chair whether |
these amendments, as substitutes, were in order?
They changed entirely the chaiactei of the ou^inal i
resolution; and, in respect to the amendment of
the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Chand- .
ler,J it seemed to him (Mr. J.) that it was not in
order, because it was so framed as to avoid one of j
the standing rules of the House, which required |
that resolutions calling for information should lie
oveifcone day; and this resolution, it seemed to j
him, would have the effect to make the Commit- j
tee of Ways and Means the organ through which
to procure information that couid not be obtained
duecily by resolution without lyinjr over.
Tne SPEAKER overruled the point of otder.
It was now too iate; but even if suggested at the
riy;ht time, it would not, in the opinion of the
Chair, have been valid.
After a brief conversation—
Mr. GIDDINGS inquired if it wa^ in order to
move the reference of the whole suuject to the
Committee on Public Expenditures:
The SPEAKER. It will not be in order. The
House is acting under the operation of the pre-
vious question.
Mr. JONES made an inquiry of the Chair as
to the particular state of the question.
The CHAIR again explained.
The question was taken, and decided in the
affirmative—yeas 10o, nays 90; as follow:

IN SENATE.
Monday, June 17, 1850.
A message was received from the President of
the United State?, in answer to a resolution of
the Senate of the 11th instant, inquiring whether
any orders have been issued to any military offi-
cers at Santa Fe to hold possession against the
authority of Texas, or in any way to embarrass
the exercise of her jurisdiction over that country,
j; and to furnish the Senate with copies of any cor- jj thing from the Governmentfor his services except
'that disttict, under the auihonty of Texas.
, ' While 1 have no power to decido the question of
' * boundary, and no desire to interfere with it as a
■ ' question of title, J have to observe that the posi-
( Hon of the territory into which u appears that
j 'Mr. Neighbors has thus gone was actually ac~
i 'quired by the United States from .Mexico, and
I ' has since been held by the United States, and, in
' my opinion, ought so to remain untii the ques-
( ' tion of boundary shall have been determined by
j 'some competent authority. Meanwhile I think
| ' there is n6 reason for seriously apprehending
' thatTcxas will piactically mterfeie with the pos-
4 session of the United States. Z. Taylor."
