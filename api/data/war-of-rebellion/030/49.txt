HEADQUARTERS, Nashville, Tenn., November 14, 1862.

General ROSECRANS:

DEAR SIR: Permit me to give you the following positive information, viz: Forest, with 1,200 to 1,500 cavalry and Freeman's battery, six guns, was this side of the asylum, 6 miles from the city, on the Murfreesborough road, last evening. He returned toward Murfreesborough at night; do not know where he encamped. Breckinridge's division is still at Murfreesborough, abundantly supplied with artillery. The road bridges between La Vergne and Murfreesborough all lately repaired,except Stone's River Bridge. Hardee's staff and baggage arrived at Murfreesborough day before yesterday. Hardee is sick, but expected daily. Chaetham's division at Estill Springs, 8 miles east of Tullahoma; Anderson's and Withers divisions supposed to be at Tullahoma. There is every indication that Bragg is massing his army on the table-lands in the vicinity of Tullahoma.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,JAS. S. NEGLEY,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Post.

[Indorsement.]
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,November 15, 1862.

General Negley will please call at headquarters and explain on what grounds he rests his belief that the information within contained is positive.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS. FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,
 DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

No. 15. Nashville, Tenn., November 14, 1862.

The general commanding is pained to learn that many soldiers have sought and allowed themselves to be captured and paroled by the enemy, to escape from further military duty, and in order to be sent home. He esteems such conduct as even more base and cowardly than desertion, which, though punishable by law with death, has a semblance of courage when contrasted with voluntary capture.

All soldiers so captured and paroled will, in future, be placed under arrest and reported to these headquarters.

All soldiers captured and paroled while straggling from their commands will be dealt with in like manner.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

 DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

No. 16. Nashville, Tenn., November 14, 1862.

The following orders, relating to the reception of a flag of truce, are given for the instruction of officers and men of this command on outpost,
