HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE BORDER,Kansas City, October 6, 1863

Colonel WILLIAM WEER,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: Inclosed are copies of telegrams from General Schofield to me, and telegram from me to General Schofield,* and copies of General Orders, Numbers 16.+

Colonel Lynde is out from Trading Post, down the Osage, with 117 men. I will concentrate available troops about Westport or Trading Post. I think you had better move somewhat westward and in that direction so as not to let Shelby get between you and Kansas. Keep me thoroughly advised as to your movements, and send your messengers by some other than the ordinary route. I shall send this to Harrisonville via Aubrey. Open communication with Fort Scott at once. Perhaps you had better march toward the line nearly in the direction of Fort Scott, bearing but little west, so that, if it is threatened you may be in time for its relief. I leave the matter largely to your discretion, suggesting that it is possible the guerrillas you are after are drawing you off from Shelby's point of attack.

Yours, respectfully,

THOMAS EWING, JR.

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., October 6, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I forwarded copy of your dispatch of the 4th instant to Colonel Weer, with instructions under which he marched at daylight this morning, with 420 cavalry and 80 infantry, from Austin, via Butler, toward Fort Scott. He is south of Osage River to-night. I send messenger at once to him to countermarch toward Clinton, reporting to General Brown there. I will collect and march to-morrow afternoon, via Lone Jack, from 200 to 300 cavalry, with four howitzers.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.

KANSAS CITY, MO., October 6, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

What force is at Fort Scott? I sent, on the 4th instant, to General Blunt, tendering re-enforcements but hear nothing from him. He is at Fort Scott. Colonel Weer, with 400 to 500, is at or about Rose Hill, where 500 guerrillas were reported on the 4th instant. I will concentrate down the line toward West Point. The troops down there are guerrillas have nearly all left my district. I think Shelby will not come north of Fort Scott, or, if he comes, will scatter his troops to make a few raids, and then disperse for the winter.

THOMAS EWING, JR.,

Brigadier-General.
