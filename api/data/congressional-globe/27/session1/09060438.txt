Public Lands—Mr. Rayntr.
H- of Reps.
facilities to the transportation of the rich products of the west
«rn ierests to the commercial depots of the Atlamic coasr. '1 his
as also the ago of mental as well as physical improvement
Science is doing for mind what ait is dome fui matter An1,
judging from the history oí (he past, the problem is soon to be
solved, of how great perfecub lity the human mind is capable
of attaining i he States of this Union, through a laudable
ambition, are running a race in this career of impi ovement In
orferno the accomplishment of these great purposes, in which
they are engaged, they must have money—yes, money -which
is the sinews of impiovement in peace, as well as of war They
want money, not for the purpose of idly spending it—not for
the purpose of giatifying the ambitious enterpuse of a day-
tout for the purpose of laying the foundations of a system of
prosperity and glory to be enjoyed by posterity fot ages to come
Fortunately for oui country and oui institutions, our vast pub-
lic domain constitutes an endless source of revenue, adequate to
the gi eat puiposes to which I have adverted And those S ates
which are in advance m tins great and glorious rate of im
pvovement have, most of them, encoun'eied debts and difficul
«es, from whieh their share of this common propeuy will re-
lieve them, without imposing domestic burdens on their own
citizens.
My next principal reason for supporting this measure at this
tune is, that we should adopt some peimanent «system lor the
future disposition of the public lands—a system which will
have, as a guaranty for its duration, the faith of the Geneial
Government on the one hand, and the vested lights and indi
vidnil interests of the ¡State Governments, on the othei I
venly believe that, unless tins question is sett'ed on «ome per-
manent basis during the present Congress, the public lands will
soon cea^L-tobe a sourco either of ordinary uvenue or that
ior distribution They will eithei be converted into political
capital, with which gambling politicians will bid for the high
places of power, or ihey will be seized with the strong hand
of violenc , and appropriated to the use of (he new States
alone that have grown into power by oui fostenngcare Need
I attempt to prove the foimer of these proposition*, when
■every aapnmg politician is toituiing his brain to invent some
■vy-.temloi the disposition of these lands which may secure to
inm the fivor of ihe ne ? and us ng States on ac< unt of its
iiemg for their benefit exclusi\ely? Ha& not this mea&uie, m a
gieatdogiee, become a parly question? D> you not see men
iiom tin1 old totaled, who received these lands osan inheritance
Horn their ancestois, and who should pieserveth mas altgacy
lot then pobtenty, willing to conveit this great national tiea
taiire into political stock to be exchanae'I foi a meie eph^meial
txercise of poweil Aienot the [íowcr andpationape incident
to the survey and sale uf thtse luids daily stiengthening the
Executive arm, andthicitenmg to poison the fountains of po
Imcdl integrity?
Is there no danger of the new fot des laving claim to the
whole of the public lands within their limits'! Tell me not of
Ci nstitu tion, of law, and of j usuce opei atmg on tommumiies,
when mteiest and power are thiown in the opposite scile I et
the apportionment of jepusentafion undei the late census take
place-—lef the. ovei whelming powei of the new Síad* once be
lepiesented in tins hall, and you wilt see whethei they will not
attempt to icconcile the appropriation of the whole public do
snain to their own use with then duty to the Constitution and
then plighted fauh to the old States This proposition was
iieard only ínlamt whispeisa few > tars since, now it is boldly
proclaimed in the councils of the nation, and we ate daily ad
monishedof the rising power of the West, and warned of the
time when that section ts to dictate law to the balance of the
Union And this system once commenced, >ou can nevei ar
rest nsprogiesg—once we rcU\ our aiaip upon the public do
main n will begone forevei For, if you give to the present
new folates all the public lands within then limits, each State
m succession, as it comea into the Union, w II claim the saint
favor, and you cannot mnsistently wuhhakl it They will not
wait till they are admitted into the Union—Tcmtoiifs will put
in their ilami-.- md, hereafter, the establishment of a Teui

are fast dining between the new States and the old miegard to
this mattei and foi identifying, foiever, then interests and the
sources of their \ tospcuty
In order to thepioper understanding of the it I ttions between
the states and t! e Genual Government m ie?aid to the ques
■ ion of ihrpu uc lands, we must go bac v toan eaily period of
our hi^toiy Ihe original patentees oí the Ci own of England
claimed all the wa^te lands as far West as the Pacific ocean
Here, then v\e -oe the claim of the Colonies totheunappro
pn ittd ¡amis of th West u identified with the inst settlement
of this country When the Colonies were afferwauK converted
into royal Governments, either by grant from the patentees oi
the forfeiture of ihen char'eis theCiown succeeded to ail then
powejsand privileges andhen<-e these waste landb, even to the
Siuth sea, were (laimed by decrown liy the tn^ty of 1763
however, the Misai uppi rivet was established a^ ht bound try
between British Am nca and Lou sjana, then twned by the
í-reneh When the Co'omes levoited against 'ht, Ilim&h Go
v*rn merit, and declared independence, each one of them claimed
all the authon'y, poweis, rights, and puvi'egeb of sovereignty

co omal chartered limits rhis question— of 'he u^J ; ,* ^p
States to all the waste lands within [hen cluiei dilr s-ex
uted ereat attention atari early period 'ftlicitev ¡innon, md
prevented foi a time the ratification of the Aitii'e of Con fed e
íation. The States which held no waste 1 irjd-= insiste J —
and wdhapparent justice, too—that as they were all engaged
m a common struggle, and as the*e wane landb were to"he
wrested trom a common enemy, by a common sacrifice, they
ought to be considered as common property to be ns d /or ihe
common use and benefit of all the States Their object was, no
doubt to secute a common fund, to pay the common debt of the
Revolution
^ome of i^e Stated refused to sign the Articles oi Con/sde a
turn, unless upon the condition that the States claiming unap-
propriated lards should surrendei them as a common fund As
early as 1776 the Convention which framed the Constitution of
Maryland passed the following resolution
" Resolvrd, unanimously, That ins the opinion of this Con-
vention that tne very extensive claim of the State of Virginia
to the back lands haih no foundation injustice, and that, if the
same or any like <, laim is admitted, the fieedom of the small
States and the liberties of America may be theieby greatly
endangered, this Convention being firmly persuaded that, if
the dominion over those land  should be established by the
hlood and treasure of the United States, such lands ought to
be considered as a common stock, to be parcelled out at pio-
per times into convenient, free, and independent Govern
mentb "
Ad late as 1779, when all the other Suites had signed the
Articles she s ill refused, and instructed her Delegates in
Congress to insist upon a surrenderof the lands by those States
claiming them The Allowing is an extract from these mstruc
lions
'We are convinced policy and justice requne that a country
unsettled at the commencement of this war, claimed by the
British Crown, and ceded to it by the treaty of Pans, if
wrested from the common enemy by the blood and treasuie
of the thirtern States, should be considered as a common
property, subject to be parcelled out by Congress into fiee,
convemert, and independent Governments, in such manner
and at such times as the wisdom of thatassemUyshallheieaftcr
direct
liTiius convinced, we should betray the tiustieposed m us
by oui constituents were we to authorize you to ratify, on
fhcirbehalf, the Confederation, unless it be further explained
We have cooly and dispasionately consideied the subject we
have weighed probable inconveniences and hardships against
the saci ifice of j nst and essential rights, and do instruct you not
to agree to the Confederation, unless an article oi articles be
added theieto, in conformity with our declaration Should
we succeed in obtaining such article oi articles, then you
are heteby fully empoweud to accede to the Confedeiacy "
When Delaware acceeded to the Confederation, m 1779, she
•also parsed the following íesolution, as apart of the condition of
her accession
11 Resolved, also, That this State considers itself justly enti
tied to a right, in common with the members of the Union to
thatextensive tiact of country which lies to the westward of
th«* fionti i of the United folates, the property of which was
not vested in or planted to, individuals at the commencement
of the present war, that the same hath been or may be gained
from the King of Great Butam, or the native Indian^ by
the blood aid tieasure of all, and ought therefore to be a com
man estue, to be giantedout on teims beneficial to the Uni'ed
States "
1 he Congress, then sitting undei the Aiticlesof Confedera
Han, feeling the great importance of preserving union and
htrmony among the States, and of uniting them in one com
mon leasrue and peeing the difficulties likely to grow out of
tins question 'noL the matter in consideration, and on the 6 h
September, 1780, passed resolution*, from which the following
aie exti acts
"That it appeals advisable to pr~ss upon those States which
cm remove the embarrassments respecting the Western coun
try a liberal sunendei of a portion of then territorial claims,
since they cannot be pieserved entire without erdangenns; the
stability of the Confederacy, &c And that it he earnestly íe
commended to those Stales who have claims to the Westem
country to passsuchlaws, and give their de'egates m Congress
such powers, as m iy effectually remove the obstacle to a final
ratification of the articiesof Confederation," &c.
By a fmther icfeience to the journals of the old Congiess,
vfi* find the íjflowmg lesaolutiun, parsed the 10th of October
17HÍ                                                                                               '
"Resolved That (he unappropnated lands tbat may be
ceded to the United States try any paiticular State, pmsuant
to the recommendation of Congress of the 6'h of S ptember
list shall be disposed of foi the common benefit of the Umted
States "
Again, m Apnl, 1783, after the ccbion fiom New York, but
befme the cession fiom Virginia, the old Congress adopted the
following resolution
"Resolved, That asafmther mean as well of hártenme the
eUinqmphment of the debts as of establishing the harmor) of
the United States, it he recommended to the States which have
passed no acts towards complying with the resolutions rfCon
irehsof the 6ihof Si otemb^r and 10 h of Octobei, 1780 rela
tive to the cession of territorial claims to make the 'iberal
cessions theiem recommended, and to the States w neh may
have passed aets complying with the said resolutions hi part
i nlv, toieviae  mdcomoletesucn compliance "
These historical incidents are important, as tending to show
th*  views and feelmss which prevailed at that tune in Ward to
thismeasute—the motives and inducements which led to the
sun ender by those Sutesclrtjmirig lands and the objects and
purposes designed to be accomplisned by those States demand
ins the sunrnder
It is veiyevi lent, from the ve(y language of the resolutions
both of the old Contris-, and the Stat e*> insisting upon a feur
lendei, tint their objects, was not only to secure peace and har
mony, but to create a peimanent common fundfor the pay
menr of the dfbt then incmred,and tobe incurred, m the pio
secution ofthewai
By examining the deeds of cession from the States which sur
ren eied ih^ir wasie lands we find another condition in
<=ei r*. 1 in f\ ery one of them—a eondition accepted by the Con
f leíanos, ind whicu lias accordingly become a part of thp
cm net The -on «non wat. that these lands weie to constf
uve i í jnd 11 be u^e 1 in the common \isc and bereft of ail
theS ate-, tb3 then were or might afeiwaids bpcome membeis
of the ConfeHirv—t' e ceding States inclusive Let us ex
am no tne dte^so^c^ssion
In the deed of region from New Yoik, which was first in
point of time in! which boie date Feb  uary, 1780. we find the
folio \ing language
'And we do by the=¡epiescnt«, in the name of the ppopi  and
foi andonbehalfofthe State of New Voik andby virtue of the
poww ard trn-^t eommittcd to nsbv the said aeiand commis
sion cde, transfer and forever relinquish to, and for the onlv
ise and benefit of such of the States as are or shall become par-
ties to the articles of confederation all the light, title, interest
jurisdiction, ar-d c'aim of the said State oi New York to t¿\
ianthiertUGues^&c, "a«4 to be granted, disposed of, aud?p=
propuatedm such manner as the Congies^ of the said United or
Confederated States shall ordei anddirect "
In the deed of cession liomVngirid which followed next, and
which bore date March, 1784, we find the follow me
"That all the lands within the temtory so ceded to theUn ted
Sta eb, and not íeserved foi or appropriated to any of the be.
foremcnUc n^d purposes, or di-po-ed of in bounties to the olfi*
ceis and soldiers of the Amencan army, shall be cons.dereiá
as a common fund for the use and benefit of such of the X nuea
States as have become, orshtll become membeis of the Confe-
deration orFedeial alliance ef said States, Virginia inclusive,
according to their usual respective proportions m the general
charge a"d expenditure, and shall be faithfully and bona fids
disposed of for that purpose, andfor no othei use or purpose
whatever "
The deed of cession fiom Massachusetts, which bore date
Mai ch, 178a, declares that her delegates, "by virtue of the power
and authority to them commuted,"
"Assign, transfer, quit claim, cede, and convey to the United
States of America, fir their benefit, Missachusetts inclusive, all
right, title," &c and concludes by declanngthat the cesión ie
made "to the u^es m a resolveof Congress of the 10 h day of
October, 1780, mentioned "
In the ces&ion from Connecticut, which bore date September,
1786, hei delegates
'Assign transfei, quit claim, c de, and convey to ihe United
States of America, for their benefit, Connecticut inclusive, alt
the right, title, interest jurisdiction, and claim which the said
S ate of Connecticut hath," <&c "for the uses" in a before 're
cited act of Assemoly declared "
Theuses mentioned m the act of Assembly referred to were
"foi the common use and benefit of the said States, Connecti-
cut inclusive "
The deed of cession fio*1! South Carolina, which bore date
August, 1787, declares that her delegates do
"As&ign, transfer, quit claim, Cede, and eonvey to the United
Sfa'es ol America, foi their benefit, all the light, title, interest,
jurisdiction, and claim which the State of South Carolina hath
in and to thebefoie mentioned and described temtory "
The tension fiom Nort'i C trolma, which boieda*e February,
1790 dtciaie=,
"That wheieas the United States, in ( ongiess assembled,
have repeatedly and earnestly recommended to \h° íespective
States m tne Union claiming or owning vacant wes'ern tern
tory to make ct^sions of part of the same as a further means,
as well for hastening the e^miguishirieut of the debts at> of es-
tablishing the haimony of the United ¡States, therefore her Se
nators convev, assign, transfer, and set ovei to the United States
of America, for the~beneiit of the s ud States. North Carolina
inclusive, all the right, title, and claim which the eaid Stilus
hath to the sovereignty and temtoiy of the lando," #x
The same being m virtue of an act of the General Assembly
of the State which e'eelared
"That all the lands intended to be ceded by virtue of this
act to the United S ates of Ameuca, and not appropriated as
before mentione 1 shall be considered as a common fund for
the use and benefit of ¡he United States of America, North
Carolina inclusive, accoidmg to then respective and usual
proportiors m theg-eneial charge and expenditure, and shall be
faithfully di^pobfd of for thatputpose, and for no other use or
purpn-,p whatevei "
In the deed of ctssion from Georg a, which was the last, and
the only one executed after the adoption of (he Constitution,
heii igdateApn! 1802, it isalso expressly stipulated that the
land-. ced°d shall he
'Cor^i'ered ps a common fund for the use and benefit of the
United ¡States Georgia included, and shall be fanhfuHy disposed
of foi that puip>se, and for no othei use oi puipnse"
By comparing thf íesoluüons of the old Congress, before
cited, inviting the States to make these cessions, with the Ian
guage used by those -tetes in their deeds of cession, we are ena-
bled to discover the motnes which induced the States to make
thee tatuotic pacniices We shall ^ee that the object, to use
the language of die act of Absrmhly of Nonh Carolina, was, "as
well fot hastemrg the extinguishment of the debts, as for esta
blibhmg 1 he hai murty of the United States " Those debts having
been ey'in*nii-bed ^nd the primary objectsof the cessions hav.
mg been accomph-hed we must recui to the deeds of cession,
in order to asccr am w hat ultimate disposition the States con-
tracted to be made of these lands.
The deed of cession fiom Virginia, which was the most im
portanf, in const ouence of the grea er amount of temtory con
veyed, expiessly stipulated that the lands ceded should * be con-
sidered as a com mo t fund for the use and benefit of such of the
United States as ther had become, or should become, members
of the Confederation or Federal alliance of said States, Virginia
inclusive, accoid i g to then usual lespective pioportionsm the
general chaiee and expendí me, and should be faithfully and
bona fide disposed of for that purpos , and for no other use or
purpose whatever " Audit is a little íemarkable that almost the
identical same language sboul 1 be used in all the deed^ of cession
They alt stipulate that the lands ce 'ed should be for the common
use and benefit of the United States Why should the ceding
States have so expressly stipulated that these lands were to be
held asa common fund, foi the common use and benefit of all
the States, if the grant was unqualified and unrestricted? Tf u
was intended that these lands should become meie national
property, the proceeds of which were to go into the National
Treasury, for theordmaiy support of the Government mall fu-
ture lime, a formal giant in general terms would have been
sufficient and why insert the express provision that they should
be held for the common use and benefit of all the Stated If a
full and unconditional power over these lands was intended to be
conveyed, why should each State have expressly provided that
this common fund should be disposed of for the common use
and benefit of all the States, the ceding State inclusive? For if
it wa3 simply intended that fhe lands should become general
property, go into the general fteasu-y, ant support the Gene-
ial Government, each State, as a member of the Confederation
would have received lis benefit and advantages as such with
out the insertion of a clause include of itself Why should
each State have expressly stipulated that the lands should mure
to the use and benefit "of such States na might theieafter be
come members of the Confederation," if it was intended that
the proceeds of these lands should always continue to defray the
expenses of the general Treasury? Had this been intended,
each and every State that might ever become a member of the
Federal alliance would have received ifs benefit, in tne exemp-
tion these lands would have afforded from other purposes of tax-
'ion, had vo clause been inserted extending th? vie and beneflt
