A bill from the Senate foi the relief of the rep
resentatives of Robert Jewett, deceased, was read
twice and committed
WASHINGTON BRANCH  RAILROAD
The bi'l supplementary to t e act for the con-
struction of a lateral branch of the Baltimore and
Ohio railroad to tntcityof Washington, was read
the third time
Mi   PARKER entered at length into his objec
tions against the passage of this bill, quoting the
acts pa sed by Congtess and the Legislature of
Maiyl md, chufly on the ground th it it gave the
coraptny puvileges too great ard ex ensive
Mr CHINN said the objections of the gentle-
man were extraordinary, for he understood him,
tne othei day, to objeit to the bill because the
Gommitteeon the D stnetof Co'umbia had refused
to grant the romp my sum lent puvileges, and he
now opposed it because the puvdeges were too
large
Mf PARKER, explained lie w.shed the ben-
efits of the bill to be extended to evei y part of the
district
Mr JACKSON, of Massachusetts, wasin favor
of the bill
The bill was then read a third time and
passed
NAW PAY BILI
The bill to regulate the pRy of the ofliceis of
the Navy of the United States was then taken
up
The bill was reíd a third time, and the question

Mi Speaker, as thib bill has consumed no less

Mr HARDI N then obtained the fl oor, and said
he wished lo su rata few remarks to the House
on the bi'l under consideiation, which was one of
gieit°r mignitude than was generally supposed
In Febmaiv, 1834 a standing commi'tee of the
House had repor ed a bill to eqial z- the pay of
< tn ers of the aim y and navy, ihe bill was refened
back to a select committee, who, in May, 1834,
jepoited a pubsiitute in lieu of it, and both the
original and substitute wete refened to a Com
m tteeofthe W! ole HousQ A variety of amend
ments were maoe m comrrn tee on the original
bill, ami yesterday the q >esuon was taken upon
engrossing the sutstitute, before it was adopted,
in lieu of the original o II, and he called upon the
Cleik to say if he was not corre^m this state-
ment
The SPEAKER said that was not material, and
was not then a question of order
Mi  HARDIN did not desire to be understood as
making it a question of order, becausej although I
be had had the honor of a seat in parhamentaiy 'I
bodies for nearly twenty foui years, he never once l'
had the honor of presidio  ovei any deliberative ¡
body, either as speaker, or as deputy speakei, or ,
¡as speaker's cnairman, for he was nev r accus   l
' tomed to wait round the Speaker's chair, and of
I course he was ignoiant of all the forms of order
He had only refened to the i roceedmg on the bill ,
fir the purpose of sbosun ' the anxiety of tne
House to get the question, by having ordeted an
amendment to be engrossed instead of the original
I bill He regretted that the subj ct had been so
earnestly piesbed upon the coiibideraticn of the
House
One argument had been uiged in favor of le0tb
latmg upon this subject, which, in h s opinion,
was altogethei unsus amable It was temarked
that we were out of debt at peace in'i all the
\ oild, that our filances were in a II unshing
condition, and that now was the time tr mcreise
the piy of officers of the  navv      In answei  to
' this, he would only remark, that we had to legis   I
late foi the future, thathowevei wemightincrease
the pay, that i <rease would lemam hereafter for ,
ages to come     1 i legulating the pay of the amy, '
the  navy, and  the uvil   hot, we  shou i  bear in
mind that we ought to regulate i   with a view to
us permai ent continuance, not  foi   the sur^hine
of peace uid ptosperity    but also with a view to
the fiscal einoarrassments incident to wai    foi  no
nation could expect to go on f oi more than twenty
years, without exieuencing  the   vicissi udes of
war     He was opposed, ger eially, to illpiopibi
tions foi the incieist of pay for any officers ot   he
Government, and mvanably v jted against them
because, when a man osee got n  o office, there
was a kind of understand ng between the < facets
and the Government that the sa'ary shou! 3 not oe
diminished, and he was theie oie opposed  to an
increase of them      lie would ask, why was this
bill, then, pressed With such eirncstness?   Where
was the necessity for it'     We were tol I by gen-
, tlemen upon the fl oor of the House, and we had |
' heard it in oui private ioomb,over and over again,
from officers of the navy, that taose offi^eis tould |
not live upon thur presetitpay If that weie true
Mr II was ready to admit an increase should be
made, but if it could be pi ived to be enough, it
ought to stand as it was Wesh nil 1 bear in mind
that our navy was yet m infancy, at d u might oe
necessary, and probably would become twice as
laige as at present,and toat theie'oie we oujht to
limit oui piesent expelditu e of the army and
lavy both, within what might be consideied oui
capacity and means                                                     >
What wts the piesent pay of the navy ? The |
aggregate amount, as certified by the naval depai t
ment, was >770 OJO, using i and lumbeis The
fli eis of the navy were bat few in numbei,
j erhaps not more than from seven hurdred to a
thousand, u eluding the whole piovided in this
bill How many of them were now ( n a time of
pi 0 foil mi peace, when the necessity foi the increase
of pay had all at once   pinng up) employed?    He
I had made some calculation from the le oitof the
I Secretary of the Navy, and with an honorable
member from Ohio had compired the numbei in
commission with those on  of commission oi  on
I the stocks, í nd he had ascertained that there were
not mi re than one sixth part e mployed (-(m yeai
I lo year, one with an > her With tne exception
of those employed at the navy yaids, who, God
knows, weie well en ough provided foi, bet er than
any othei cilicei* of the Government, there were
not moie than on  ffth employed on the ocean
Wheie weie tne residue' Gen=ial!y at their
houses, or taking their pleasuie     .Now, new old
I ask, when only about one fourth oi one fifth of
these ofK e's were employed on the ocean, and the
balance at home, wheie was the imperious neces
bity for t) e increase of their p-y at this particul i-
tmW Th<-y n >w received, us lu had said ab )ut
£>770,( 00, not including the appropriations unde,
the ordinary bill Now, what was the inciease
pmposed by this bill'1 As the bi I was íepoited
last febru iry twelve month, it increased th*> pay
! of the navy $116 000, and the Day of the officeis
of the army £,70,000 in round numbers, for he
would not detain tne House with fractions On
referrn g the bill back again to a select com-
mittee, they knocked  the army olí altogethei,
and reported a suostitute for the nnginal hill,
increasing the pay of the navy $84 500, making
a total increase of $200,500 The bill was then
refened to a Committee of the Who'e House,
where it underwent a vauetyof mod fications,
and befoie it came to the amendment passed
yesteiday, Mr H sent the bill to 'he Navy De-
partment, and by that means ascertained that the
increase amounted to the sum he hud stated,
§200,500 After ti at calculation bad been made,
one of his colleagues [Mi Pope] moved an amena
ment pioposmg to incea^e the pay of past mid
shipmen A gentleman fiom Mane made a cal-
cul  ion ab to how much that amendment would
add to the bill, and he made it appeal to be %32 000
Mr II 'a calculation,founded upon the re urns of
the Navy Department, brought it to ^31 C00, and
if tnese were correct the whole increase would be

fhe modificamos of the gentlemen fiom Vn-
gima [Mr Wisr] adopted yesterday, in rela ion
to the pay of ciptaios of the navy, diminished
that sum about j, 15,000 There weie thirty seven
cap anís, about • f. o th ids of them had their pay
lessened about ¡jSOO each, and about one thud of
them £>250 each, n iking, accoiiling to Mr H 's
es'imate, about filó 00', leaving the actual in
t rease by the b I!, ab p ibsed the c immittte yes
terday J2j1,0l)0—and all this in a time of profound
peace And if, evei oui n vy should be filled up
fie had no douut the increase would t mount to no
less than $500 000 a year He was peifecily
confident that he was no maccuiate to the amount
of fi ty dollars, in any one calculation If the
estímales of the Navy Depaitment weie couect,
tnen bv the fiist bill tl ere would be an increase of
§110,000, and by tne second bill of j>84 5Ü0 addi-
tional
If the calculations of the N ivy Depaitment were
not in i^curate, Mi II was satisfied that the whole
ni ease would be £,251,(00 Gentlemen might
sijj this b II w is in lieu of all lommuta'ion, and
that the £770,000 included eveiy thing except
the item of mileage, whicn could not be calculated
with any piobablt ctitamty As this bill was an
actual increase upon the present pay of (he navy,
taking it al ogether, of about f257,000 belter
th m one fouith, and not quite a thud, the whole
wou'd heie ftu amount to about ^1,03 ,000 a
yeai, and when the mileage of ten cents a mi'e
was added, they might fnrly estimate that our
naval i fhceis in time.* of piofound peace, would
cost the Government ^1,100 000 annually He
had made inquiries a& to what the whole civil
Government, including the legislative, executive,
and judici il departmen s of the seveial fctates of
Vnginii, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois,
Missouri, Kentuckj , rein>e&s e, Alabama, North
and South Gtrolma, miking eleven S atts the
whole machinery of the Govern ment of those States
put tcgether fell short, by at least §100 000 of what
was proposed, in a time of profound peace, for the
officers of the navy of the United States Surely
there was something in this How much was it
on the old J fTersoniati plan ? That a meie hand
ful of men, m times of profound peace, when net
more than one fifth of them were engaged, shoti'd
cost the Govcinment of the United States $100,0J0
moiethin the whole civil governments together
of eleven States of the Union' Suiely, surely,
we must have fallen on fine days of retrenchment
and iefoim indeed1 in the year 1808, it was
| lomulgattd to the world what won lious things
would be done upon the subject of retrenchment
and reform ' How have thebe promises been ful-
fil led > Office after oifice had been ci eateil, emolu-
ment afttr emolument had been added and in
creased, and now, to sum no all, an inccibe of
pay of offcers of tne navy to raoi° than a fouith,
í nd little less than a thud, was to be made He
called upon those gentlemen as^-ocia ed with him,
who «e'e atlached to the political parly that
governed the nation, and who won I be held
re=oonstble to the count! y, to look at tl e leports
issued fiom the House—to look at the circilar
letteis, the speed es published, and those r'so
made oi the btump, and they would find them-
selves held responsible for all this F >r twep y
yeais Mr H had been c intendn g to bring this
Government back to its original expenditure, and
he sho lid con mue to do so as lon£ as he had the
horor of a seat upon that floor     He had not con-
