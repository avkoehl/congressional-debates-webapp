with 4,000 men, He is already on White River. Latest advises from Little Rock is that Price, with a very heavy cavalry force, was moving to cross Arkansas River, above Little Rock. General WEST is after Shelby, who is near Jacksonport, and I have 2,000 cavalry who will co-operate with West. The enemy is believed to be gathering extensive supplies at Jacksonport and Batesville, preparatory to a big Missouri raid. It may be headed off it WEST is successful; but I am confident that the enemy is bound for Missouri, unless headed off.

The Secretary of War directs that salutes of 100 guns be fired at 12 o'clock noon at each arsenal in the United States on Tuesday, September 6, or on the day after the receipt of this order, on honor of victories in Mobile Harbor, and on the day after at new Orleans, Mobile, and Pensacola in honor of General Sherman's victories at Atlanta.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

U. S. FLAG-SHIP HARTFORD,

Mobile Bay, September 5, 1864.

Major General E. R. S. CANBY,

Commanding DIVISION of WEST Mississippi:

GENERAL: I regret that you are likely to be annoyed by Kirby Smith, but as a matter of course they will use the same exertions to draw off your forces from Mobile that we were using to draw their from Atlanta. As my work appears to be at an end for the time I shall ask a respite from duty, as I have not felt well lately. I never was in favor of taking Mobile, except for the moral effect, as I believe it would be used by our own people to flood rebeldom with all their supplies. I am confiding them pretty strictly to the limits of their city, so far as the bay is concerned.

Wishing you every success, I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. G. FARRAGUT,

Rear-Admiral.
