MAROARKT ANN WALLACB.
Mr. BURR, from the same committee, re-
ported a bill (H. R. No. 1227) granting a
pension to ^Margaret Ann Wallace, with an
amendment in the nature of a substitute.
The substitute was read. Jt directs the Sec-
retary of the Interior to place on the pension-
roll the name of the applicant, widow of the
late Brigadier General W. H. L. Wallace, for
a pension at the rate of fifty dollars per month
from the 10th of April, 1862. It further
provides that the pension heretofore allowed
to the said widow under the general law be
discontinued.
Mr. HOLMAN. I see this pension is fifty
dollarsa month. It makes an exception. There
ought to be some uniform rule on the subject.
The general law allows only thirty dollars a
month.
Mr. COOK. If the gentleman will examine
he will find it to be the fact that in every case
where a brigadier general has been killed on
the battle-field, as was General Wallace, the
pension granted by special law to the widow
has been fifty dollars a month. There are five
such cases, and this is the last one that can be
affected by this rule. I have made the exam-
ination, and I understand that to be the fact.
Mr. HOLMAN. All I wanted was to be
informed of that fact. I have no objection.
I will inquire if the name of Brigadier Gen-
eral P. A. Hackleman is included in any of
these acts.
Mr. B U RR. It does not appear on this list.
Mr. COOK. I cannot tell the names of all,
but I know the names of five.
Mr. HOLMAN. I give notice that I will
introduce a bill covering that case.
The bill, as amended, was ordered to be
engrossed and read a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
