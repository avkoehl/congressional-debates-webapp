us, we opened fire, which did good service. This was about 12 m. Soon after this Colonels McDowell, Hicks,and others formed their regiments and I fell in with them, and we, advanced to the northeast across the open fields and into the fire then raging in McClernand's camp, where I was ordered by General Sherman to file to the left in line of battle which maneuver I executed well under the circumstances, the enemy's fire being very heavy. All the troops were forced back to the end of the camp under this tremendous fire, and the loss on both sides must have been heavy. We were compelled to fall back, and I again formed line on the tops of the next ridge, when you arrived with your regiment and we bivouacked for the night, being exposed most of the time to a severe rain-storm. Our pickets were placed in advance by your order, and all was reasonably quiet during the night.

Early on the morning of the 7th a severe cannonade was opened by General Wallace's battery on our right, and we were ordered to advance, which we did in good order, the Forty-eighth on the right, Seventieth in the center, and Seventy-second on the left. We, under your orders and that of General Sherman, after advancing about one-half mile, were moved to the right and ascended a hill and passed by the flank under a severe fire, where we were ordered to half and remained for about two hours, while the batteries on both sides were in full play. About 12 m. we were ordered to advance, and the Seventy-second, Forty-eighth,,and Seventieth (in this order) advanced to the southeast about three-quarters of a mile into McClernand's camp (precisely the position occupied by the Seventieth the day before), where we deployed into line under the immediate orders and presence of General Sherman (superintended by yourself), where we opened fire with good effect upon the enemy, one-half of the Seventieth Regiment firing to the right and the other to the left oblique. The enemy fell back under this fire, and we advanced to the edge of the woods at the head of the camp near a pond.

Our ammunition at this point failed, and part of General McCook's division coming up opened upon the enemy in fine style. The whole brigade retired to received a fresh supply of ammunition, which as soon as we received we again advanced over the same ground and towards our encampment; but the enemy was rapidly retiring, and we entered our original camp about 5 o'clock p.m. Our camp had been torn down by the enemy, and we lay upon our arms during the night exposed to a severe rain-storm, the enemy having hastily retreated and with great loss.

Our camp was plundered of nearly everything-officer's uniforms, camp equipments, blankets, knapsacks, haversacks, clothing, &amp;c. Our men, when called out on Sunday morning, supposed it was only to support the pickets, who had been in constant alarm for the two preceding days, and we never made any provision whatever for any retreat. In this great battle for two consecutive days, from morning till night, under the most terrific fire of modern times, I am happy to state that our loss is	 comparatively small; Killed, 9; wounded, 57; missing, 36.*

A large number of non-commissioned officers and privates behaved themselves under the most trying circumstances like old veterans. They deserve to be remembered for their good conduct. Many other brave men were broken and separated in the melee, and found their way into
