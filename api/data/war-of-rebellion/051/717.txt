number of these engines from the Ohio roads and send them on this line.

The necessity of another wire for telegraphic purposes, with a double set of operators, was very forcibly impressed upon me during these operations.

I had neglected to mention the pillaging done by the enemy at Shelbyville, of which Colonel Galbraith will make a report.

We picked up 6 or 8 prisoners, stragglers from the enemy.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major General, Chf. of Staff, Temporarily Comdg. 12th Corps, &amp;c.

CHATTANOOGA, VIA BRIDGEPORT, October 5, 1863.

Commanding Officer, Wartrace:

Move your troops at once to Duck River Bridge, and hold that point until every man is sacrificed.

G. GRANGER,Major-General, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, [October] 10, [1863.]

BEGGS: How came you to run yourself and party from Decherd to Cowan without order from this office? You must not take orders to run train on main line from any officer, let his rank be what it may, without orders from this office. A little explanation to any officer will show the necessity of this. I repeat the former order:

"All trains will be dispatched from this office."

Do not leave Cowan without orders from this office; we do not consider you to blame, but give you this as authority.

YATES.

News from the battle-field splendid. About 30 wounded soldiers just brought in. The rebels are completely routed. Several hundred reported killed and wounded, with 300 prisoners.

Respectfully,

ROBT. GALBRAITH,

Colonel, &c.
