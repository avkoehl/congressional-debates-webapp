to report in person at Jackson, which I did, and agreed to assist in organizing the troops of WEST Tennessee, General Forrest assuring me that I should have a brigade, which I have, and with which I am well satisfied, and so are the men. A copy of the orders I received from General Pillow, with my muster-rolls, have been forwarded to Richmond. I received neither arms nor accouterments from General Pillow. The regiments he speaks of arming or the ones I armed with the arms obtained from Generals Bragg and Lee. I entertain the highest regard for General Pillow, both as a man and an officer, and were he in this department could have no objections to him as a DIVISION commander but prefer remaining with my brigade in the department.

I am, captain, respectfully, your most obedient servant,

T. H. BELL,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
