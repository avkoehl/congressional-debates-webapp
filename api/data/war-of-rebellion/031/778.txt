General HORATIO G. WRIGHT:

General Kelley, in dispatch of last night, says:

I am now strongly impressed with the belief that Jackson will not attempt a movement toward Western Virginia,and, if he does, he cannot subsist a force that would be required to drive me back. I feel that I am fully able to protect the railroad and to prevent a raid on Western Virginia. My scouts report nothing new from below to-day.
