with directions to his main line to occupy their places in the advanced pits as soon as they left them, and charge as soon as the advanced line reached the works. By this happy arrangement but few men were exposed to the enemy's fire until the advance skirmish line was near enough to silence the enemy's artillery, although all were in easy musket-range. The first line advancing under a heavy fire of musketry and canister, covered by a sharp fire from the main line, soon reached the main works, and a cheer was given as a signal to charge. The charge was made successfully and taken up by the Thirteenth Corps and General Steele's command on the right. I am certain that the time the other commands started. He captured in his immediate front 1,624 prisoners, including 2 brigadier-generals and 98 officers, 4 stand of colors, 21 pieces of artillery, and 4 mortars. His loss was 42 killed, 142 wounded, and 4 missing; total 188. This makes the results of the two days at Spanish Fort and Blakely as follows: 2,164 prisoners, 71 pieces of artillery, 8 stand of colors, and nearly 3,000 stand of small-arms. The loss of the command at both places is, killed 68, wounded 461, captured 5, missing 2; total 536. I transmit herewith the reports of division and brigade commanders and a full list of casualties,* with a schedule of the artillery captured. My division and brigade commanders behaved nobly throughout, and to their energy, skill and endurance is due the main credit of the success. I would especially mention Colonel James L. Geddens, Eight Iowa Infantry, commanding Third Brigade, Third Division, for his gallantry and grit in the charge on Spanish Fort. Although suffering with a severe chill at the time, yet the remained upon the field and superintended the movements. Also Lieutenant-Colonel Lackland, One hundred and eight Illinois Volunteers, serving upon the staff of General Carr, who took a musket and led personally the two skirmishing companies that first gained a foothold within the enemy's works. Captain Bluford Wilson, assistant adjutant-general, Third Division, particularly distinguished himself during the siege and acted as aide to Colonel Geddes during the assault. Captain H. L. Wheeler, Ninety-sixth U. S. Colored Infantry, acting engineer officer, Third Division, performed his work with great skill, energy, and industry. In the Second Division, Colonel T. J. Kinney, One hundred and nineteenth Illinois Infantry, and Lieutenant Colonel Charles S. Hills, Tenth Kansas Infantry, led the advance skirmish line in front of their respective brigades and have more than earned promotion. First Lieutenant and Bvt. Captain Charles J. Allen, U. S. Army, chief engineer, performed his duty excellency well and rendered efficient appreciation and prompt execution of the duties pertaining to their several departments.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. J. SMITH,

Major-General.

Brigadier General P. J. OSTERHAUS,

Chief of Staff, Military Division of West Mississippi.
