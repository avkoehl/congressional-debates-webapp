His pickets fired and fell back 300 yards, when they were re-enforced by Lieutenant Cornell, and in turn drove the enemy back and established his lines as formerly, since which time all has been quiet and no enemy visible. This attack occurred about 7.30 a.m. A young contraband at Lieutenant Cornell's headquarters came in previous to this attack and reports two brigades of the enemy's infantry in the vicinity of Reams' Station.

GENERAL: I have just sent in two deserters from the Eighth Georgia, who can give you a great deal of information. Their homes are near Atlanta. They say all the cavalry was sent off yesterday to Hampton; that they were under arms all day yesterday and night before, expecting attack from us; that they don't think there is any idea of attacking us; that they know Kershaw's division had returned from the Valley, but think no other of Early's troops.
