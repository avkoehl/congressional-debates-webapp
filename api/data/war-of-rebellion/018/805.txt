night, but the colonel of them is going to have his own way, and is unwilling to assist as I have proposed. He is really in our way is he does not move.

Respectfully,

Major, Seventh Infantry.

ALEXANDRIA, VA., September 2, 1862.

Major General GEORGE B. MCCLELLAN:

I have the honor to report the arrival of my command to within 3 miles of Alexandria. They are very much worn-out by the last twenty days' marching and have lost heavily in the recent engagements. Generals Kearny and Stevens were both killed in the engagement my command had last evening with Jackson near Chantilly. Our loss was severe, but we drove Jackson back more than a mile, and occupied the field of battle until 3 a. m. this morning. All our wounded were placed in a hospital near the field.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. L. RENO,

Major-General.

UPTON'S HILL, September 2, 1862.

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that you hold your command ready to cover the retreat of our army should any part be driven back near your position. He also wishes you to send your cavalry scouts well out toward Dranesville, as far as they can go with safety, and watch carefully any appearance of the enemy in that direction. It is though that our army will fall back to-day. This will be regarded as confidential.

Very respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,
