Tell me your exact wants, and you shall have every man I can give, and still hold road and Kentucky. Supplies are being sent by Cumberland and Green Rivers. Hope they are navigable.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

Morgan destroyed Bacon Creek and Nolin bridges and trestle-work at Elizabethtown and Muldraugh's Hill. Will take four or five weeks to repair damage. I am sending fleet of boats up Cumberland; if they cannot pass the Harpeth Shoals by lighters, can stores be wagoner the 24 miles to Nashville? I am sending boats up Green River to Bowling Green, and can supply you in that way. After Colonel Harlan fell on Morgan, and drove him, he passed near New Market, 8 miles of Lebanon, where Colonel Hoskins attacked him, killing some, capturing 60 men, his caissons, ammunition wagons, and provisions. The Ninth Kentucky Cavalry, under Lieutenant-Colonel Boyle, and Sixth Kentucky Cavalry, under Colonel Halisy, were pursuing him. Colonel Halisy was killed. Hope General Reynolds will follow him, as he left Glasgow two days ago for Greensburg. Morgan retreating by way of Columbia. Congratulate you on your brilliant victory, and regret heavy loss of officers and men.

Lieutenant Fitch promised a convoy of gunboats up Cumberland.
