Ohio*. Though the Federal agent, on the 30th of July, 1863, notified me that General John H. Morgan and his office would be placed in close confinement, he informed me two months afterward that "the U.

5. Papers from 48 to 57, inclusive, relate to the detention of surgeons+. Before the date of the cartel surgeons were unconditionally released after capture. That rule was first adopted by the Confederate commanders, and was subsequently followed by the Federal. Some time ago, one Doctor Rucker was indicted by a grand jury in Virginia for several felonies.
