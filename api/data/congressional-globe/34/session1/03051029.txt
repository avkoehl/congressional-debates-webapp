it," would have been used. The very fact that
it was then proposed to come over the Potomac
above Georgetown excluded the possibility of
anybody entertaining the idea that they meant to
cross Pennsylvania avenue. That would bring
them into "VVashington at a point north of the
avenue; and why once, being north of it, they
should cross it to the south, and then cross it
again at another point to reach the Baltimore
depot, and take this zigzag coursfe, would be
unexplainable. They would have had to cross
it twice, if that was their object. There would
have been no sense and no reason in that. As I
have stated, however, the proposition was, that
they should have power to come along the ave-
nue, to occupy it, to put their railroad upon it,
and Congress meant to guard against that. There
was no proposition at that time to cross the Po-
tomac at the Long Bridge. I will read the enact-
ment. The first section of the act provided:
<โข* That the Alexandria and Washington Railroad Com-
pany, incoipoiated by the Legislature of Vnginia on the
27th of February, 1854, to construct a railioad from Alex-
andria, ill the State of Virginia, to the city of Washington,
in The District of Columbia, be, and they aie hereby, author-
ized to extend their road from any point on the Virginia
side of the Potomac nver to which said road may be con-
structed, at or above the aqueduct of the Alexandria canal,
into the District of Columbia."
Not at the Long Bridge, where they are now
crossing the river. No authority was given them
to cross the river at that point, but " at or abovo
tire aqueduct, "which is two or three miles beyond
the point where they are now crossing the nver.
What then? The act goes on to provide:
" Connecting with the Baltimore and Washington Rail-
road depot by Hie most convenient and practicable loute or
routes, passing tlnough and alone' such streets and avenues,
except the Pennsylvania avenue, of Washington and
Geoigetown, as the corporate authorities tlieieot may re-
spectively approve, subject to certain conditions heiemafter
expressed."
The whole legislation proceeded on the idea
that they were to cross the Potomac river at, or
above, the aqueduct; and that then they should
not come along Pennsylvania avenue. They were
not interdicted the privilege of crossing the av-
enue, because nobody supposed that they could
ever design to do such a thing. If they had pro-
posed to cross the Potomac river at the Long
Bridge, Congress, no doubt, would have said,
"You shall not cross Pennsylvania avenue;"
because then it would have occurred to every-
body at once, that if the railroad reached this
side of the river by way of the Long Bridge, it
would bo necessary to pass over Pennsylvania
avenue in order to get to the Baltimore depot.
Inasmuch, however, as they proposed to come
across the Potomac river at a point far above the
bridge, and above the termination of the avenue,
there was no necessity for saying that they should
not cross the avenue, for such a thing could not
have been m contemplation. 1 think that it is
perfectl y clear.
My friend from Georgia Kay;; that this whole
question is one of convenience to Senators. No,
sir, it is no question of convenience to Senators.
The question is, whether we shall preserve this
great thoroughfare from the encroachments of
private corporations ? If this were the only
means of connecting Alexandria and Washington
by a railroad, I would say, whatever might be
the temporary inconvenience, I would grant it;
but that is not so. You have graded the streets;
you have made them convenient for laying down
a railroad track; and a private company occupies
them because you have expended the public
money in preparing them for the track.
Mr. President, the whole scheme involved in
this matter is an attempt to induce Congress to
build a bridge across the Potomac river for the
benefit of a private company. This matter
commenced by an appeal to Congress to allow
this company to cross the Long Bridge with its
railroad. Congress refused, and told them, "You
shall not cross there at all, but you must reach
the District side of the river at or above the aque-
duct." Next we ascertain that they are running
a railroad toward the Long Bridge on both sides
of the river, not, it is true, crossing the Long
Bridge, but evidently contemplating that Con-
gress hereafter is to build a bridge at that point,
and give this company the right to run their rail-
road on it, which is but giving them J] ,000,000,
I tell you now, from the National Trcasuiy for
private company. It will cost ยง1,000,000 to
construct a bridge across the river suited for a
railroad at this point; and this company now
contemplate the erection of a bridge there by the
Government for their private use. If they did
not so contemplate, it would be a matter of no
consequence to them whether they ran the rail-
road where it now is, or not.
I have said that, if there were no other way of
connecting Alexandria and Washington, I should
withdraw my objection, and allow this track to
remain where it is; but there is another way, a
better way, a more convenient way, a more proper
way in all respects; and that is to allow the Bal-
timore and Ohio Railroad Company to cross the
eastern branch of the Potomac at the Navy-yard,
to go down on the north side of the Potomac river,
to cross the Potomac opposite Alexandria, by
steam ferry-boats, thus abstaining from inter-
ference in the navigation of one of God's great
highways. Sir, I esteem this whole proceeding
as but an incipient step towards the erection of a
bridge below Georgetown, which is to be perma-
nent, and lasting, and ruinous to that ancicnt city.
While I feel bound to protect the interests of
Washington, I also feel bound to protect the in-
terests of Georgetown. Both are within the Dis-
trict of Columbia; both are subject to our care,
and both should receivc our protection. I tell you
now, sir, that, if you permit this obstruction to
stand, the result will be that by and by this com-
pany will cross the Potomac at a point near that
where the Long Bridge now stands, and on a
bridge erected by the Government out of the pub-
lic funds. That is the scheme; I am opposed to
it. If they wish to cross the Potomac at orabove
the aqueduct, as the law prescribed, let them do
it; or if they wish to change their policy, and
cross the Eastern Branchatthe Navy-yard,and go
down on the north side, of the Potomac, and reach
Alexandria by a steam ferry-boat from a point
opposite that city, let them do that; neither will
interfere with the commerce of Georgetown, nor
with any of the rights given to any portion of the
people of this District by nature.
I shall not go further into the question; in
fact, I did not rise to discuss it; but when the
Senator from Georgia attacks the n port in this
case as resting upon unsound principles, I beg to
say to him that I have looked somewhat into the
authorities, and I feel perfectly assured that on
the legal proposition we are right: that this com-
pany had no authority to put the road where they
have put it, and that they placed it there in vio-
lation of law. I say further that the city authori-
ties of Washington have no jurisdiction over the
streets. I do not mean to say that the corporate
authorities have not the power to improve, to
adorn, to beautify these streets. I do not mean
to say that Congress may not give them the tem-
porary jurisdiction over the streets; but I do pre-
tend to say, on the authorities which I have con-
sulted, that the jurisdiction is so perfectly vested
in Congress for the benefit of the people of the
United States that it is inalienable, and thatthey
have no right to part with it.
Mr. TOOMBS. I ask the Senator if we have
any more jurisdiction over this District than Mis-
sissippi has within her limits?
Mr. BROWN. Certainly not.
Mr. TOOMBS. Cannot Mississippi vest the
control of the streets and avenues in the city of
Natchez in the corporate authorities of that city
Mr. BROWN. I stated before thai you re.'
ceived the precise soil on which Washington city
stands, not by a deed of cession from Maryland
and its acceptance by the United States. I know
that, by that deed, you got the general political
jurisdiction under the Constitution; but in addi-
tion to that, there were special deeds from the
proprietors of the soil, giving it to the United
States on conditions which they expressly pre-
scribed in the conveyance. One of these was that
the jurisdiction should bo in the United States or
in Congress, for the benefit of the people of the
United'States. Tf you can violate the deeds under
which you hold the soil, and under which you
accepted the property from the original proprie-
tors, you can cede jurisdiction m perpetuity to
the corporation of Washington; but 1 maintain
that you cannot do it. If you can, what Con-
gress is to do it? This one? "Will not the next
Congress have the same power which this has?
If the two agree, will not the thinl have the same
power that both the others had ? I hold the
doctrine to be sound, that when the jurisdiction
is in Congress for the benefit of the people, you
may grant the temporary use, but you cannot
alienate the jurisdiction. This is the doctrine of
the report.
Mr. TOUCEY obtained the floor.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. I desire to suggest to
the Senator from Connecticut, and to the Senate,
that the empty seats in the Chamber remind us that
it is impossible to dispose of this subject to-day.
It is one of importance, and the usual hour of
adjournment has arrived; therefore, with the con-
sent of the Senator from Connecticut, I move that
the Senate adjourn.
Mr.TOUCEY. I give way for that purpose.
Mr. BROWN. I shall not oppose the adjourn-
ment, as I know that very few Senators are here,
and we are not very enthusiastic over this ques-
tion; but I ask that the business of the District of
Columbia maybe assigned for one o'clock on next
Friday, so that this bill and two others may be
disposed of on that day. There may be one or
two other small bills which may be reported in the
mean time. If that be the understanding, I shall
not object to the adjournment.
Mr. FITZPATRICK. I withdraw the motion
temporarily. '
Mr. BROWN. Then I move that this bill be
postponed until next Friday, and made the special
order for that day at one o'clock, with the other
District of Columbia business.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate ad-
journed to Monday.
HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.
Friday, Jljiril 25, 1856.
The House met at twelve o'clock, m. Prayer
by the Chaplain, Rev. Daniel Waldo.
The J ournal of yesterday was read and approved.
REPORT FROM THE COURT OF CLAIMS.
The SPEAKER. The first business in order
is the consideration of the bill reported from the
Court of Claims. On that question the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Ritchie] is entitled to
the floor.
Mr. GIDDINGS. This is objection day, and
I would inquire whether the bill on objection does
not go over?
Mr. RITCHIE. Mr. Speaker, I wish to make
an explanation. I have been so engaged on other
matters, that I have been unable to prepare my-
self for the discussion of the pending question. I
have some views to submit on it, and it was my
intention to ask its postponement until next Fri-
day. If it bo in order, I now submit that mo-
tion .
The SPEAKER. It is in order.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. OLIVER, of New York. Mr. Speaker,
the memorial of R. P. Eldridge was improperly
referred to the Committee on Invalid Pensions.
I move that that committee be discharged from
its further consideration, and that it be referred
to the Committee on Military Affairs.
Mr. GIDDINGS. I have no particular objec-
tion to the gentleman's motion, but I hope that
all the committees will be afforded an opportunity
of making reports upon private bills. This is
private bill day, and I hope it will be devoted to
that class of business.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman object
to the proposition of the gentleman from iSiew
York ?
Mr. GIDDINGS. I do.
ADJOURNMENT OVER.
Mr. RITCHIE. I move that when the House
adjourns to-day, it adjourn to meet on Monday
next.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. COBB, of Alabama. This is objection
day, and I hope we shall give our attention to the
Private Calendar. I move that the House resolve
itself into a Committee of the Whole House on
the Private Calendar.
REMISSION OP DUTIES.
Mr. WATSON. I rise to a privileged ques-
tion. I move to reconsider the vote by wliich
the House on yesterday refused to sustain the
decision of the Chair in reference to the bill for
refunding the duties on goods, wares, and mer-
