CINCINNATI, June 16, 1863.

General BROOKS,

Pittsburgh, Pa.:

General Willcox tells me you have asked him for the Seventy-first Indiana. I have just ordered it to be ready to come in this direction, to be sent down into Kentucky, where our line is very weak and very much threatened, but if the danger of a raid on Pittsburgh is more imminent, I will try to aid you with that regiment or some other. Please give me as much notice as possible.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
