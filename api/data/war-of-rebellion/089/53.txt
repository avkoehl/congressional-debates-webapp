HDQRS. ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, SIGNAL DEPARTMENT,October 3, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: The following has just been received from the signal station near Jerusalem plank road, dated 10 a. m.:

About 1,500 infantry with arms and knapsacks have in small parties left their works in vicinity of the Gregory Chimneys and point of woods to the left. Also they came from the works in edge of woods in rear of Gregory's Chimneys or to the right of the steeples and from some points farther to the right. They all appear to aim for some point in the road leading southward from Petersburg, but that road is not visible until it passes the lead-works. But few troops remain visible in the intrenchments and from the lead-works to beyond the Gregory Chimneys.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. S. STRYKER,

Acting Chief Signal Officer.

Major FISHER:

Just received the following report from Captain Thickstun:

Over 300 men left the enemy's works between Norfolk railroad and plank road and passed toward large camp. Could not see whether they went farther to the left or not, as I could watch only one point at a time. A large number may have gone.
