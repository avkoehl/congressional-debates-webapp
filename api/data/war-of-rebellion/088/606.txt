Major-General BARNARD,

City Point, Va.:

General Ord informs me that there will be but two companies of infantry (negroes), numbering in all about sixty men, to go to Harison's Landing. With this force it will be impossible to do any work, as it will all be required for guard duty. The wharf will have to be repaired before the artillery and cavalry can land. I send down some engineers to-morrow early to repair wharf and erect the works.
