HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 1, 1863-5.30 a. m.

General HOOKER,

Chancellorsville, via United States Ford:

From deserter, just in, learn that Jackson's whole corps in opposite Franklins' crossing. Camp rumor that Longstreet had gone to Culpeper; that Lee had said it was the only time he should fight equal numbers; that we had about 80,000. Some of Trimble's division told him they had to march to Culpeper to-morrow. They all knew that we had crossed 40,000 men above.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD.

CHANCELLORSVILLE, VA.,

May 1, 1863-7 a. m. (Received 11.30 a. m.)

Major-General BUTTERFIELD, Chief of Staff:

Hurry over the provost-marshal-general and his cavalry. Major-General Sedgwick was directed to throw his whole force on the Bowling Green road and no other.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.

CAMP NEAR FALMOUTH, VA.,

May 1, 1863-8.30 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

Your dispatch, dated May 1, without hour, relating to Sedgwick and Bowling Green road, the bridges, Patrick's and Gibbon's movements, received. Your dispatch is dated May 1, and says Patrick and Gibbon are to cross to-morrow, which would be May 2. Is this right? I send 4 signal officers, mounted and for duty, to Captain Fisher, who is chief of the signal force on the right. Can send 1 more, if wanted. I have endeavored to send this dispatch by telegraph, but the line works very badly, and I send by orderly. I hope to have the new line constructed
