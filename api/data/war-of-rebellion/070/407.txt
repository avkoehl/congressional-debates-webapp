HDQRS. CAVALRY DIVISION, DEPT. OF WEST VIRGINIA, May 8, 1864.

[General A. N. DUFFIE:]

GENERAL: The general commanding directs you to hold your command in readiness to move at 8.30 p. m. of this day. Colonel Schoonmaker's brigade will have the advance, followed closely by your command. You will endeavor to get your command out of camp quietly, and will leave an officer to withdraw your pickets when the division is on the road. It will be necessary to be well closed up, that they may not lose the way.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,WILL RUMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Should the enemy be encountered during the night fire-arms will not be used if it can possibly be avoided.

WILL RUMSEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, My 8, 1864.

[Brigadier General W. W. AVERELL:]

GENERAL: I think it would be very advisable to issue an order in reference to the building of fires on the roadside to-day. The brigade in my front fired the woods in several places yesterday, and for two hours my command was marching through fires on each side of the road, many horses having the hair on their legs and trails burned. The command entire, with the exception of a few horses, is in excellent condition and spirit.

Respectfully,J. M. SCHOONMAKER,

Colonel.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE, Tazewell Country, Va., May 8, 1864.

Captain G. W. McVICKER,

Commanding Third West Virginia Cavalry:

SIR: You will immediately proceed with your command to one mile beyond Jeffersonville, and will picket with your command all
