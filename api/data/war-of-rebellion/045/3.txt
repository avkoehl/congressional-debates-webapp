HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,
June 3, 1863

Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS,
Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: Please show the inclosed note to Major-General Hooker. He knows who Mr. Smith is. Should Stuart attempt a Maryland raid, it
would be more satisfactory to us than his remaining quiet at Culpeper. It is my impression the rebel army has been weakened by troops sent west and south, and that any performance of Stuart's will be a flutter to keep us from seeing their weakness.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. PLEASONTON,
Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Inclosure.]

WASHINGTON, D. C.

June 1, 1863.

General PLEASONTON,

DEAR SIR: Colonel [George W. von] Schack has sent an officer to Bealeton Station, on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, and I have been ordered to join him; leave this evening for that place.

There is one thing that looks very apparent to me, and that is, that this movement of General Lee's is not intended to menace Washington, but to try his hand again toward Maryland, or to call off your attention while General Stuart goes there. I have every reason for believing that Stuart is on his way toward Maryland. I do not positively know it, but have the very best of reason for believing it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. S. SMITH
