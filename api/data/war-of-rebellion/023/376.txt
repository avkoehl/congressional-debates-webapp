HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, 1862.

COMMANDING OFFICER DAVIS' DIVISION, Near Florence or Eastport:

Instead of marching by Pulaski or Shelbyville you will move by Florence, and thence direct by Columbia to Nashville. Move by forced marches. Leave tents and all surplus baggage at Florence and carry rations in your wagons. If necessary take county wagons also. You must take at least eight days' full rations from Florence and more if possible. Keep your men on half rations. Lose no time.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, 1862.

General FRY, Decherd:

Direct General Sill to remain with his brigade for the present to assist in collecting and guarding supplies at Decherd, but to march and join General Schoepf at an hour's notice in case of necessity.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, 1862.

General FRY, Decherd:

Take all the supplies you can carry in your baggage wagons and haversacks, and be prepared in all respects for active service. I wish General Schoepf to establish himself in advance of Tracy City, if, as I suppose, there is a road leading from there to the Anderson road toward Chattanooga. He must examine into that and report immediately. Great care must be taken that dispatches are not captured.

Have you and General Schoepf the letter cipher?

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, [1862].

Colonel HAZEN, Murfreesborough:

Have you heard anything of General Johnson?

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 20, 1862.

Colonel INNES, Stevenson:

It is reported the McMinnville road will be finished to-night. You need not take your companies there. Take five companies to the Louisville and Nashville road and push it with all energy; everything depends on it.

D. C. BUELL.
