manner be discharged.
Mr. KING. The amendment has been read.
It is not necessary to recur to the provisions of
the other bill. As I said, I think a majority of
the Military Committee preferthe bill as it passed
the Senate. My own preference is for this meas-
ure, chiefly because it provides for mustering out
of service, and thus requires the action of Con-
gress to determine what the peace establishment
shall be when the time arrives for determining
that question.
Mr. McDOUGALL. I think the amendment
of the House of Representatives is legislating in
the wrong direction. I do not believe that the bill,
as originally presented by the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs, was at all adequate to our present
necessity; and I introduced a resolution this morn-
ing for the purpose of bringing before the Mili-
tary Committee the question again in a new form.
I think that we shall be able to legislate for the
future when the future has developed itself; but
at the present time we ought to put into the field,
as a permanent force, all the force that,so far as
we are now advised, will be needed until the pres-
ent war is over.
I was not satisfied with the bill as it passed the
Senate, and I am still less satisfied with it as
amended in the House of Representatives. The
provisions of the amendment are calculated to do
mischief in the service, and destroy the spiritand
force of men now engaged under arms for the
cause, and those who may be called upon to take
up arms hereafter. I believe firmly that we want
to organize a regular standing force for the pres-
ent purpose ten times as large as is named in the
bill; and when we shall have conquered a peace,
we shall have the power then, being advised, to
disband the troops, and relieve the country from
the burden of its expenses. I think, myself, the
bill was weak enough as we passed itâ€”too weak;
and worse as amended in the House of Repre-
sentatives. I am opposed to concurring in the
amendment, and hope that the Military Commit-
tee may report a bill, without providing for the
contingencies of years to come, that will organize
a regular military force upon the basis of the pres-
ent regular military establishment, so that the
officers who go into the service will understand
their business, and the men who enlist under them
will understand that they are bound by the regu-
lations of the service, and have the field officers
appointed upon consultation by the heads of the
military departments. It is required by the times,
and I think we might as well meet that require-
ment.
The question being taken, the amendment of
the House of Representatives was not con-
curred in.
  PAY OF SENATOR DOUGLAS.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore laid before the
Senate the amendment of the House of Repre-
sentatives to Senate resolution No. 5, to pay to
the widow of the late Stephen A. Douglas the
amount due to him as a Senator at the time of his
death; which was, after the word " dollars," in
line ten, to insert the words, " and also the sum
of ^1,030 for mileage."
Mr. CLARK. I desire to say that it is entirely
conlrary to the practice of the Senate for some
four or five years. I think in no ease since the
act increasing the pay of members of Congress,
when Senators have died in this way, have we
paid mileage. I think there wore three cases oc-
curring one session. We passed a general reso-
lution that the administrator or personal repre-
sentative should be entitled to the proper pay at
the rate of $3,000 per annum; but in no case should
they receive less than three months' pay, but
without the mileage. The committee reported
this joint resolution m accordance with that pro-
vision. There is a general icsolution standing on
the statute-book that the heirs of the member arc
to be entitled to his pay without the mileage. I
hope the amendment will not be concurred in.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The question
is on concurring in the amendment of the House
of Representatives.
The amendment was non-concurred in.
EMPLOYMENT OF VOLUNTEERS.
Mr. WILSON. I ask the unanimous consent
of the Senate to introduce a bill, of which no pre-
vious notice has been given; and I should like to
have it considered to-day, without reference to a
committee. It is very brief, and important.
There being no objection, the bill (S. No. 42)
in addition to the "act to authorize the employ-
ment of volunteeis, to aid in enforcing the laws
and protecting public propel ty," approved the22d
of July, 1861, was read twice by its title. The bill
authorizes the President of the United States to
accept the services of volunteers, either as cav-
alry, infantry, or artillery, in such numbeis as the
exigencies of the public service may, in his opin-
ion, demand, to be organized as authorized by the
act of July 22,1861. The volunteers thus author-
ized are to be armed as the President may direct.
They are to be subject to the rules and articles of
war, and are to be put, in all respects, on a foot- *
ing with similarcorps of th% United States Army,
and are to be mustered into service for and during
the war.
Mr. FESSENDEN. X should like to see and
examine that bill. Unless it can be explained, I
think it had better be passed over.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill, hav-
ing been read twice to-day, can only be consid-
ered by unanimous consent.
Mr. WILSON. I will explain why it is ne-
cessary to pass the bill to-day.
Mr. PEARCE, I prefer that it should lie oyer.
I do not exactly understand the object of the bill;
and I want to know something about it.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Objection be-
ing made, the bill cannot be considered to-day.
It will go upon the Calendar.
Mr. PEARCE. If there is no further business
before the Senate, I will move that the Senate do
now adjourn.
Mr. FESSENDEN. X ask the Senator to with-
draw that motion for a moment.
Mr. PEARCE. Certainly; I withdraw it.
Mr. GRIMES, [After a pause.] I move that
the Senate adjourn.
Mr. FESSENDEN'. I ask my friend to with-
draw that.motion. Why make such a motion?
We may perhaps pass the bill of the Senator from
Massachusetts.
Mr. GRIMES. Because I am satisfied there
is no necessity for passing that bill to-day. How-
ever, I will withdraw the motion, if the Senator'
desires it.
Mr. KING. I understand there will be a mes-
sage from the President in a fewjninutes.
EXECUTIVE SESSION.
Several messages in writing were received from
the President of the United States, by Mr. Hat,
his Secretary.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I move that the Senate
proceed to the consideration of executive business.
I understand there are some executive communi-
cations just received.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate pro-
ceeded to the consideration of executive business;
and after some time spent therein, the doors were
reopened, and the Senate adjourned.
