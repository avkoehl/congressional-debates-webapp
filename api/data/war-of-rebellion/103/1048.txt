He has only some cavalry, General Taylor has only garrison of Mobile, about 5,000 men, French's division,of Stewart's corps, Gibson's, Sharp's, and Brantly's brigades, of Lee's corps, in all about 2,000 more. The two last brigades are under marching orders to North Carolina. General Taylor has also Forrest's and Roddey's cavalry, about 12,000 men. No forces left in Georgia except local reserves and militia, absentees and furloughed men returning to the army. For plan of enemy's operations see Richmond Whig, 4th instant.
