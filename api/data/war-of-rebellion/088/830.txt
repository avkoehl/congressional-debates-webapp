HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 14, 1864. (Received 1 p.m.)

Major-General BIRNEY,Commanding Tenth Corps:

The concluding paragraph of your dispatch, just received, stating result of your artillery fire, leads me to think that the language of my previous dispatch was not sufficiency explicit. The intention of the commanding general was that before opening such heavy fire, under the circumstances stated, his sanction should be obtained.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
