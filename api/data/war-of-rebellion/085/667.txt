Brigadier-General FISK,

Jefferson City:

You are doing well. Say to Generals McNeil and Sanborn what I telegraphed General Brown. Take advantage of everything; strike the hardest kind of blows. The great object is to get them where we can hurt them, and then mow them. The last, not less than 800 to 1,000, put off the fight at pilot Knob, and did not dare storm Ewing's little breast- works at Leasburg.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major- General.

JEFFERSON CITY, October 6, 1864- 7.30 p. m .

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis, Mo.:

I have received your telegram of this date. The enemy crossed the Osage in large force at Price's Ferry, under cover of artillery, at noon to- day. Colonel Philips, Seventh Cavalry Missouri State Militia, was guarding the crossing at that point and fought their superior force as best he could. A few killed and wounded on both sides. Sanborn has moved to meet the enemy between Moreau and Osage,o n the route to Price's Ferry. McNeil will contest their advance on the right. I assumed command of our combined forces to- day and organized them into brigades under Brown, McNeil, Sanborn, and Colonel Hickox. General Brown is particularly charged with the completion of the defenses and preparing for one last stand int he trenches. Officers and men are a unit, all pushing in harmony. The story will soon be told, We shall fight. I trust the troops from below are close upon the foe.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO.., October 6, 1864- 6.20 p. m.

Brigadier-General FISK,

Jefferson City:

You will be senior in rank until a senior joins you. After hurting the rebels all you can outside, your next step will be to secure everything for an assault. It may be made with some vim, but after getting whipped at Pilot Knob and backing out from Ewing's little intrenchment at Leasburg, I am satisfied that all you need is coolness and determination to slaughter them. The best would be to get them to try two or three terrible assaults, and slaughter them so that our cavalry could sally on them while they are demoralized, and rout them. We will. What is the best route for myself or General Pleasonton to come with staff and escort!

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major- General.
