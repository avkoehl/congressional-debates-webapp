General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant-General, Richmond, Va.:

Owing to reduction of forces I shall leave this department with great concern, which would be much diminished if General hill were ordered to relieve me, for since his arrival here he has been making himself acquainted with the forces and localities. My chief of staff is still quite sick, and cannot be at present of much assistance to General Jones. I am confident a positive order from War Department would be obeyed with alacrity by General Hill.
