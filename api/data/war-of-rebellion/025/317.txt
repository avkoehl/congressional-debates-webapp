JACKSON, November 2, 1862.

Major-General MCPHERSON, Bolivar, Tenn.:

Hamilton started this morning. Is moving on Grand Junction. He will put himself in communication with you to-morrow. Start in the morning and try to so arrange as to have both columns reach Grand Junction about the same time. I will join you to-morrow night or the next day. Supplies will be sent from Bolivar as far as possible for further wants.

Two additional regiments will reach Bolivar to-night or to-morrow. This will give a garrison for Van Buren or other available points on the road. Every arrangement will be made to forward other re-enforcements if we should go far south. Re-enforcements are also going to Sherman, and we may look for him. Cavalry should be well thrown out to the west.

Have you any further news from the front?
