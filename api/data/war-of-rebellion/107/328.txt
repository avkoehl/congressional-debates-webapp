STAET OF PENNSYLVANIA,

Harrisburg, April 18, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

DEAR FATHER: I reached here last night and found 460 men, and they almost entirely without arms. I sent them, however, by the 8 o'clock train of this morning, in company with a company of regulars, who passed through from Minnesota, the gentlemen here thinking that they would be a sufficient escort. There will be 2,000 or 3,000 troops here during to-day, but without arms or ammunition. Please instruct Colonel Craig to give the bearer of this, Colonel McCoy, an order on the arsenal at Philadelphia for 5,000 stand of arms and a sufficient quantity of ammunition. If this is done immediately we will be able to start several thousand by Saturday morning, or if Colonel Craig telegraphs to Philadelphia early to-morrow morning we can send them by to-morrow night.

Your son,

J. D. CAMERON.
