for offenses alleged to have been committed by him in North Missouri in June, 1864, and was sentenced to be hung. General Rosecrans disapproved the proceedings of the commission (see General Orders, No. 211, series 1864, Department of the Missouri), but ordered him (Truman) confined in Alton Military Prison until further orders. The record in the case was forwarded to the Secretary of War before I assumed command of this department. The Secretary of War ordered Truman released from confinement some time in March last, and on his release he was ordered to Washington, D. C., or some place East, by Colonel Baker, U. S. detective at Washington, and we heard nothing further of him until a few days prior to my departure from Saint Louis to this place, when I was telegraphed from Macon, Mo., that Truman was up there and that met Holtzclaw, Anderson, and other guerrilla leaders, who proposed to surrender, and an escort was asked to enable him to accomplish it. After consultation with my provost-marshal-general (Colonel Baker) I gave orders to the commanding officer at Macon to furnish him an escort, under charge of a most reliable officer, with instructions to allow no outrages to be committed, and for them to confine themselves to the simple purpose of securing the surrender of the guerrillas. After my arrival here I was informed that my instructions were being disregarded, and that Truman was acting badly, and I promptly telegraphed Colonel Denny, at Glasgow, to arrest him which was done, and he is now in Saint Louis in the custody of Colonel Baker, provost-marshal-general. I inclose herewith Colonel Denny's* dispatch from Colonel Baker, and my dispatch+ directing that an escort be furnished Truman. As Judge Hall has gone out of his way to reflect on me in this matter, I desire that he shall see this.

I have the honor to be, sir very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., May 19, 1865.

Lieutenant HARDING, Aide-de-Camp,

Macon:

Send good officer in charge of twenty men to accompany Truman in obtaining the surrender of the bushwhacking gangs. The officer must be careful and allow no outrages committed. Answer.

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, June 4, 1865.

Brigadier General P. E. CONNOR,

Julesburg:

Five regiments of cavalry will leave here during the week, well mounted and well equipped and plenty of transportation. Six hundred horses have gone forward to you. No more stock. I will try to get the other 500 more infantry. I will have to get them form the East. Do you not think you could escort stages with 400 wagons?

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
