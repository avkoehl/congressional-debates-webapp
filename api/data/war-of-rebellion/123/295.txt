Commisioner.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., August 5, 1862.

His Excellency ISRAEL WASHBURN, JR.,

Governor of Maine:

Have the regiments that were to move on Monday gone?

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Similar to Governor Andrew, Boston, Mass.)

AUGUSTA, ME., August 5, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Regiments have not marched because I have not been paid United States bounty as promised for advance. There is but one mustering officer in the State, and the regiments are in different places and it will take him some time to muster and pay bounties. I asked for another mustering officer, but could not have him. Will Government require the regiments to leave the State before being paid?

I. WASHBURN, JR.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington City, D. C., August 5, 1862.

Governor ISRAEL WASHBURN, JR.,

Augusta, Me.:

Applications for men in the field to officer new regiments are so numerous that great inconvenience and injury to the service must ensue if all are granted. Some general rule will be adopted soon and made known.

By order of the Secretary of War:

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(Same to the Governors of the loyal States.)
