TUPELO, June 11, 1864.

GENERAL: The battle of Tishomingo Creek, fought yesterday by Major-General Forrest, is one of the most signal victories of the war for forces engaged. The secured results on the field so far are 200 prisoners, 12 pieces of artillery, 150 wagons, mostly loaded, and more still coming in. Most of the animals were ridden off by the enemy. The rout was complete. Our forces, less one-quarter, in close and vigorous pursuit. Our loss so far will not exceed 400 killed and wounded. Too much praise cannot be awarded the gallant Forrest and his brave command.

(Via Mobile 13th.)

Forrest fought two white and one negro brigade, of infantry and 2,500 cavalry, commanded by Sturgis and Grierson; entire force 7,000. These were not Trans-MISSISSIPPI troops. One of Roddey's brigades arrived to join fight; other brigades now coming up. Have drawn 1,200 cavalry from Alabama, leaving 1,800 for works. These will keep my force concentrated in North MISSISSIPPI for present, as Trans-MISSISSIPPI troops have arrived in Memphis from below, and some veteran troops from Saint Louis. Should force leave Memphis, can then send Forrest into Middle Tennessee. Forrest's victory will be great diversion in favor of Johnston.
