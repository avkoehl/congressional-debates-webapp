HDQRS. STATE OF ARKANSAS, ADJT. GEN'S OFFICE, Little Rock, June 15, 1865.

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,Secretary of War, Washington, D. C.:

SIR: I am requested by His Excellency the Governor of the State to ask that the citizens of Arkansas now serving in the regiments of other States be mustered out of the service. There is a large class of this class of soldiers on duty in the Department of Arkansas and elsewhere in regiments from Missouri and Kansas, and somewhat from Iowa and Illinois. Many of their families are in the State in the most destitute condition, while others are refugees and equally requiring their assistance. It is also a matter of very great importance in the maintenance of law and order, and the restoration of peace and quiet throughout the State, that they should be permitted to return to their homes at the earliest possible moment to secure that preponderance of tried loyal sentiment so necessary in the present emergency.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. W. BISHOP,

Adjutant-General.

GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, No. 116. Washington, June 17, 1865.

Enlisted men of the Veteran Reserve Corps who, if they had remained in the volunteer regiments from which they were transferred to the Veteran Reserves, would, under existing orders, now be entitled to muster out of service, will be so discharged, provided that no man shall be mustered out who desires to serve his full term.

By order of the Secretary of War:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
