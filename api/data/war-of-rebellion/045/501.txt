General ALPHEUS S. WILLIAMS:

We have repulsed them on every part of the line. Thousands of prisoners, &amp;c. Look well to your front. The brigade is halted on the road, and, if you want it, send for it. Let me hear from you often.

Very respectfully,

H. C. RODGERS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SIXTH CORPS, July 3, 1863-8. 30 p. m.

General SLOCUM:

I am pleased to inform you, should its services be required, I have a brigade you may call upon.

FRANK WHEATON,Brigadier-General.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 3, 1863-9 a. m. (Copy received, War Department, 9. 45 a. m.)

General MEADE, Army of the Potomac:

My scouts inform me that Lee is hurrying everything forward. Troops passed through Greencastle yesterday on the way to Chambersburg. Even his raw troops were pushed forward. Lee has a depot of stolen horses and baggage at Cashtown. General Smith is hoping to look after it. Is moving this morning.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 3, 1863-7 a. m.

Major-General FRENCH:

General Meade directs me to say that the enemy attacked us vigorously yesterday, and was repulsed on all sides. The conflict is apparently renewed to-day, and we have retained our position. Should the result of to-day's operations cause the enemy to fall back toward the Potomac, which you would probably learn by scouts and information from Hagerstown, &c., before you would be advised from here, he desires that you will re-occupy Harper's Ferry and annoy and harass him in his retreat. It may be possible for you now to annoy and cut his communication with any cavalry or light marching infantry you have; of this you can judge. If the result of to-day's operations should be our discomfiture and withdrawal, you are to look to Washington, and throw your force there for its protection. You will be prepared for either of these contingencies should they arise.
