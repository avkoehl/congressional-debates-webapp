Mr. DAWES. Mr. Chairman, no one, so
far as I tecolleet. has doubted the sincerity of
the eonwetions of the gentleman from Indiana,
[Mr. Kcuu:] and hence it is altogethei a
wotk of supt-reioration <m his part, to insist
upon it so often that he is sincere. It is, how-
ever, passing strange to me that the gentle-
man, conscious ol' his own rectitude in tins
matter, persists in denouncing the motives of
all who differ with him upon this tioor, and
declaring thar theiraetion is in the interest of
plunder and jnbs—of theft, and robbery.
Why. Mr. Chairman, since the foundation
of the Government gentlemen who believed
as the gentIeman from Indiana believes, have
continued this cry in the ear of the people
until the thing has become as a 44 sounding
brass and tinkling cymbal." Yet, Mr. Chair-
man, the gentleman is astonished at the indif-
ference ot the people to this outcry that comes
from himself and others. He cannot under-
stand why it is that the people look about and
test all this by the ptactical lesults all around
them. That is the whole answer which the
people give to this constant outcry coming
from the gentleman and his associates, based
upon convictions the sincerity of which I
never doubted.
Mr. Chairman, the gentleman says this pro-
posed redaction is not enough; he would like
a reduction of twenty or thirty per cent, i
know that. I know the gentleman would
prostrate the entire industries of the country
at the feet of foreign producers and collect—if
he could have his way, for I have otten heard
him say so—all the expenses of this Govern-
ment by direct taxation -ot the people of the
country. That he could not get; and there-
fore he comes as near to it as he can. He
desires to approximate all our legislation to
the condition of things which daring his travels
last summer fillrd his eyes with such admira-
tion all over the comment of Europe and the
kingdom of Great Britain. Sir, I nevjr was
there. I have a love and admiration for my
country, a partiality for its institutions and its
identity. This leads me—perhaps it is ignor-
ance of what the gentleman has seen and I
have not—but it certainly leads me to feel
that " ignorance is bliss" under such circum-
stances. I would rather have our growth ; I
would rather have our history; I would rather
have our means of development, our condition
of society, our prosperity, whatever may ha
the gentleman's theory.
Now as to this question of ten per cent.
If gentlemen desire any success in tariff legis-
lation during this Congress they must accept
this ten per cent, proposition. It is the only
thing that can become a law. Take our ex-
