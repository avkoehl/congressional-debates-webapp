PETERSBURG, June 17, 1864.

General R. E. LEE:

General Dearing informs me that young Harrison, living near Fort Powhatan, reports that yesterday large numbers of Grant's troops crossed James River above Fort Powhatan. Yankee soldier boy has stated to citizens their number to be 30,000 between James River and Petersburg, on way to join troops already here.+

General R. E. LEE:

Prisoners just taken report themselves as belonging to the Second, Ninth, and Eighteen Corps. They state that the Fifth and Sixth Corps are coming on. Those from Second and Eighteenth came here by transports and arrived first; others; marched night and day from Gaines' Mill and arrived yesterday evening. The Ninth crossed at Turkey Bend where they have a pontoon bridge. They say Grant commanded on the field yesterday. All are positive they passed Grant on the road several miles from here.

DOCTOR WILCOX'S, June 17, 1864-4 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel TAYLOR:

COLONEL: I am in sight of the enemy's pontoon bridge at Wyanoke Neck. Their infantry and artillery was principally crossed at this point in transports. Their cavalry left Charles City Court-House this morning. No troops crossed at Berkeley. The rear of their infantry column left this place last night. There are very extensive works on this place extending from the river toward Hopewell Church. They have placarded that Petersburg is taken, 22 pieces of artillery, 3,000 prisoners, &amp;c. Can see no opportunity of doing anything, as the Peninsula is flanked by large number of gun boats. There are ten in sight from this place.

Very respectfully,

W. H. F. LEE,

Major-General.

P. S.-Will return to camp to-night and await orders.
