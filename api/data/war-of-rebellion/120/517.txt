own lime I have repeatedly laid before the quartermaster, but he thought it unnecessary and impracticable, without too much expense of preparation. The great scarcity of lime is doubtless much occasioned by the absence of 100-days' men living near here. The Commissioner-General of Prisoners is respectfully reminded that I am in most matters compelled to depend upon my subordinates for facts. I have placed great confidence in Major Scovill's experience and judgement, and have given them timely and pertinent admonition about his prison duties. I think proper results will soon be reached.
