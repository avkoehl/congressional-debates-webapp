very winding. There ought to be a picket with rockets on the marsh just at Masonborough Inlet. Paris knows the place. It is about 100 yards from the breakers and men can march or ride over the marsh from there to Berry's Salt-Works.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

SMITHVILLE, December 27, 1864 - 4.20 p. m.

General WHITING:

DEAR GENERAL: Last information from you is that all is yet safe. General Bragg, I believe, visited Fisher. I am in trouble to think that you, my superior, should have to fight one of my forts, but will not complain; I understand you. I believe and hope Lamb is doing well. He ought to understand me by this time. Tell him I have heard that he has done well, as I expected. We had not the troops to meet the landing, note that, in accordance with our previous notions. God keep you. Do not expose yourself unnecessarily.

Yours, sincerely,

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

SUGAR LOAF, December 27, 1864 - 4 p. m.

Brigadier-General HEBERT,

Smithville:

The enemy has re-embarked and transports seem to be moving south. Watch and be prepared at Bald Head and Lockwood's Folly. Report instantly appearance of fleet.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

SMITHVILLE, December 27, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

General BRAGG:

If the enemy have left Confederate Point I ask to be re-enforced. I am very weak everywhere.

LOUIS HEBERT,

Brigadier-General.

GANDER HALL, December 27, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Brigadier-General HEBERT,

Smithville:

General Whiting is directed to return your troops, and the five companies are returning from Georgia. Notify General Bragg promptly of appearance of fleet off your entrance, and you will be immediately re-enforced.

ARCHER ANDERSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
