HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,November 16, 1864.

Major-General HALLECK, Chief of Staff:

I have not yet heard from the list of promotions which I asked for on account of meritorious conduct on the 19th of October. The service of some of these officers will soon expire, and they will be lost to the Government. Colonel Devin, of the cavalry, goes out on the 18th; Colonel Duval will also go out by expiration of service. The promotions I referred to are scarcely an equivalent for services performed.
