Assistant Adjutant-General.

PITTSBURG, PA., July 18, 1 863. (Received 8 p. m.)

Some uneasiness is felt about a riotous spirit that is thought to exist. To be ready for any emergency I would like to have the battery and two three-months" regiments sent to West Virginia returned. A number of colored men have been drafted and accept as substitutes. No instructions have been received as to their disposition. I think they ought to be got out of the city as soon as possible.

Do not permit any postponement of draft in districts where ordered, as has been done by Colonel bomford in the Fifth District in this city. The effect will be very bad.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General of the United States:

COLONEL: In my last communication to you I stated that there were from 4,000 to 5,000 men assembled to resist the draft. Since that time I have learned from reliable information that there are at least 10,000 men that can assemble within twenty-four hours time. My forces here at present will not exceed 150 men, which is entirely inadequate for the purpose they were designed for.
