from taking horses from Macon County. There are sufficient among the rebels down this way. Aid Forbes all you can. I have ordered ammunition form Saint Louis for your militia organization. Telegraph me daily.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

GLASGOW, September 27, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM FORBES,

Macon, Mo.:

You will remain at Macon City. Colonel Kutzner will move to Glasgow. Put your organization through vigorously. Make your presence and power felt among the bushwhackers and their friends. You will have to keep one eye to Monroe and Northern Randolph. Compel a co-operation on the part of citizens all around you. Aid the militia in a thorough organization. Consult freely with Colonel A. L. Gilstrap and other reliable loyalists. Discourage the rebels in all possible ways and encourage the faithful to rally round the flag. Hot times are upon us. Listen only to friends. Kick enemies out of your council chamber. Make them hew your wood and draw your water. Telegraph me daily. Thirteen bushwhackers's funerals in this neighborhood yesterday.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MACON, September 27, 1864.

General FISK:

Major Johnston attacked Anderson at Centralia this afternoon. Our forces are cut to pieces and Major Johnston supposed to be killed. Major Johnston had parts of two companies-probably 200 men. Captain Smith supposed to be killed. Rebels have 600 to 700 men.

E. A. KUTZNER,

Colonel, &amp;c.

GLASGOW, MO., September 27, 1864.

Colonel E. A. KUTZNER,

Macon, Mo.:

I have concluded to leave Colonel Forbes at Macon and bring you to Glasgow. You will move here with eighth companies of your regiment, leaving two companies subject to orders from Colonel Hayward if he desires it. Consult him forthwith. Make your dispositions accordingly and move to Glasgow at the earliest practicable moment. Take no horses from Macon County. Leave that field to Colonel Forbes. We must move with vigor and be prepared to meet a large invading force in the direction of Boonville. Move with caution; avoid surprises; kill bushwhackers, and worry the life out of their friends. Major Johnson can press rebel transportation from Paris and bushwhack across the country. One company will [be] left as garrison at Sturgeon. Lieutenant-Colonel Stauber will be relieved

to look after the rascals in Monroe County. Consult freely and act in vigorous harmony with Colonel Forbes. Warm times are approaching. Loyalists must stand firmly together, and rebels and their counsels must have the cold shoulder. Let the infernal rascals of this region have a good taste of the genuine loyalty of the northeast.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
