BROADWAY LANDING, VA., September 29, 1864-4 p. m.

Major-General ORD,

Old Headquarters Eighteenth Corps:

Spring Hill fort was counted upon to defend pontoon bridge; this being now removed to Broadway, receives no protection from it. There are three large companies in Fort Converse, say at least 300 men besides my company. There are only 100 men to defend the pontoon brigade, to protect my siege depot, and to load my train if ordered in. The enemy are just reported as massing in rear of the line on Weldon railroad. In view of these facts I requested the services of my company where it seemed to me they would be most useful. Unless I am responsible for the defense of the landing I do not press it.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.
