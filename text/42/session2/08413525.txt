to have taken from the Speaker's table for
consideration at this time Senate bill No. 931,
authorizing the construction of a bridge across
the Arkansas river at Little Rock, Arkansas.

a lew more members are present.

bridge, and to establish the same as a post
road, be taken from the Speaker's table, and
concurred in.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. I would like to
know something about this bill.
Mr. McCRARY. It is for the construction
of a bridge at Fort Madison, lovva. The
amendments of the Senate are for the purpose
of securing more effectually the object con-
templated.
The amendments of the Senate were read
for information.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. It appears that this
bill changes the width of tin; span of that

tunity to look into the measure. I must object
to the consideration of these amendments
now.

ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. DICKEY. I wish to'interpose an ob-
jection now to the doing of any business by
unanimous consent (I do not care what it is)
in the absence of a quorum. I do not, of
course, object to the mere reference of bills;
but I object to taking anything from theSpeak-
er's table by unanimous consent, I do not care
what it is, because that is the most dangerous
sort of legislation in the world.
Mr. RANDALL. I move that the House
take a recess for thirty minutes, with the
view of seeing whether we can get a quorum.
Mr. DICKEY. If a quorum of the House
can be obtained, of course I have no objec-
tion to business going on.
Mr. RANDALL. I have made my motion
in the interest of the public business.
The SPEAKER. It will require unanimous
consent to take a recess. Is there objection 1
Mr. KETCHAM. I object.
Mr. STEVENSON. Members of the
House are coming in. Let us proceed with
business.
Mr. RANDALL. If the chairman of the
Committee on the Public Lands [Mr. Ketciiam]
will not accept my motion, which I have made
in his interest, then I object to any business
in the absence of a quorum. I do not want to
break up the House: and that is the reason I
have proposed a recess for thirty minutes.
Mr. KETCHAM. We have some matters
ready to report which will provoke no discus-
sion whatever.
Mr. BURCHARD. I rise to make a report
from the Committee of Ways and Means,
which is authorized to report at uoy time.
Mr. RANDALL. I object.
The SPEAKER. Is there objection to
taking a recess till eight o'clock?
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I object.
Mr. STEVENSON. I think we may as
well have a call of the House if there is uo
quorum present.
Mr. McCORMICK, of Missouri. I with-
draw my objection to a recess.
The SPEAKER. Is there further objec-
tion?
Mr. STEVENSON. I object, and call for
the regular order. Let the Committee on
I ublic Lands go on with its business; if there
should be no quorum we can get one.
Mr. RANDALL. I make objection to the
consideration of any business until a quorum
is present.
Mr. STEVENSON. I call for the regular
order.
Mr. RANDALL. We may as well settle
this matter first as last. Let it be understood
that those who do come here in the evenings
wish to have the company of other members
who are in the habit of staying away.
Mr. CONGER. I do not know whether
that is desirable or not.
'1 he SPEAKER. The regular order is the
presentation of business from the Committee
on Public Lands; but the rules require the
presence of a quorum for the transaction of
business, and authorize the Chair to take note
of the fact when a quorum is not present.
