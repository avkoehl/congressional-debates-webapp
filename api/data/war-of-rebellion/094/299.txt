SIR: The major-general commanidng was this morning surprised and disappointed to learn that the railroad bridge at Franklin is not yet finished. He says that you must finish it to-day, and have trains as far as Spring Hill this afternoon. The army is suffering for forage, which it was expected the railroad would bring before this.

U. S. MILITARY RAILROADS, OFFICE OF ASSISTANT ENGINEER, Franklin, December 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I regret to say it will be utterly impossible to finish the bridge to-day. We are making but slow progress, on account of the high water and the mass of wreck and iron in the stream which it is next to impossible to remove. Our ropes freeze and stiffen, and the men are scarcely able to hold themselves on the scaffolding on account of the ice. We cannot possibly cross the bridge before to-morrow noon, unless the water falls and weather moderates. We are doing all that can be done under the circumstances. I have sent for Colonel Wright.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. H. EICHOLTZ,

Division Engineer.
