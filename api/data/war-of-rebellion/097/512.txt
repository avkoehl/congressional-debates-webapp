GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS,

April 3, 1865.

General MEADE:

You will march immediately with you army up the Appomattox, taking the River road, leaving one division to hold Petersburg and the railroad.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,River Road, near Sutherland's Station, April 3, 1865-3 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have directed General Wright with the Sixth Corps to proceed up the River road till he crosses the road leading from Sutherland's Station to Exeter Mills and then to halt. General Parke, with two divisions of the Ninth Corps, will be moved in rear of Wright. The supply trains of the Second, Sixth, and Ninth Corps I have directed to come after us on the Cox road because the River road is very bad and I doubt if the trains could be gotten over it. I understand the Second Corps has crossed the Appomattox at Exeter Mills. I was under the impression I was to follow the infantry under the command of Major-General Sheridan. My headquarters will be for the night at near Sutherland's Station. I will await further orders.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 3, 1865-9.15 p.m.

General GRANT:

I send you a dispatch just received from Major-General Humphreys.* He is on the Namozine road, has not crossed the Appomattox, and is moving under General Sheridan's orders, and has received no notification from General Sheridan that he is returned to my command. He is rationed till to-morrow night. I will send three days' rations up to him ahead of the Sixth Corps. I understand the Fifth Corps trains are on this road; if this is the case I cannot get off till their trains have cleared the road. If General Sheridan has not been advised of the Second Corps being returned to my command I would suggest its being done, or an order from your headquarters being sent to General Humphreys, as confusion may arise from a conflict of authority.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
