New Hampshire quota......................... 4,000

Deduct excess............................... 1,500

_______

Number actually required ................... 2,500

Both States now furnish in all since the last call 4,000, which is fair and just; but now by applying the system adopted the quota of each State will be seen to be different, although the same number is obtained from both together as before.

The 6,000 required is multiplied by 3, giving 18,000; to this is added the excess of both, 2,000, and the gross quotas are then assigned:

Vermont................................ 10,000

Deduct excess......................... 500

________

Divide by 3........................... 3)9,500

________

Number actually required............. 3,166 2/3

____________

____________

New Hampshire........................ 10,000

Deduct excess........................ 1,500

_________

Divided by 3......................... 3)8,500

__________

Number actually required........... 2,833 1/3

While by your own statement Vermont should furnish 3,500 and New Hampshire but 2,500. I would also bring to your attention the fact that the State with the largest excess has by this operation had its quota increased, while that with the least is diminished.

Requesting that this communication may be referred to the Board which you have appointed to examine this subject, that our quota may be assigned on the principle that you yourself have indorsed, and that you will give me the earliest possible notice of the result of that examination.

I am, sir, with the greatest respect, your most obedient servant,

JAMES Y. SMITH,

Governor of Rhode Island.

[Indorsement.]

MARCH 1, 1865.

Respectfully referred by the President to the Honorable the Secretary of War.

STATE OF RHODE ISLAND, EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

Providence, February 13, 1865.

GENTLEMEN OF THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES:

On the 6th instant I dispatched my private secretary, Colonel Charles E. Bailey, to Washington for the purpose of bringing to notice of the War Department the injustice of the quota assigned to Rhode Island under the last call of the President of the United States for 300,000 men, issued December 19, 1864.

I present herewith the report of that officer for your information.

JAMES Y. SMITH.
