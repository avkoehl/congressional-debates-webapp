Major-General BUTLER:

I have just come up the river from near Wilcox's Wharf. Captain Fitch, with the army gun-boat Parke, was near there when a section of artillery fired into the transport this p.m. and shelled them out, afterward landing a party to ascertain where they were gone.

C. K. GRAHAM,

Brigadier-General.

CHERRYSTONE, July 13, 1864

Major-General BUTLER,

Headquarters:

GENERAL: Rumors through rebel sympathizers give us fears of another raid upon this post, which at this time is invaluable to the Government business from the whole Western army, Baltimore,&amp;c., passing through this office thence to Washington via Point Lookout. Only eighteen men here, and we respectfully ask that you will increase the force to protect us in the discharge of our duties. Please answer immediately.

W. A. DUNN.

S. C. BURNS,

Operators.
