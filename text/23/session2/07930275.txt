a proposition existing to form a government of
blacks ou our borders There was one already
established in Canada, formed of the negroes flora
our own terntoiy, and occupying one of the most
fertile sections of the country He asked, what

i selves' It would beajnootnee Weiewedead

m contemplation, (though it did not deserve the
name of territory, and he would not call it such )
would  make a parallel with tallen Rome     Our
governor or supetmtendent would reeemble her
proconsuls He hoped the members of that
House would pause before they recognised the
p.maples sanctioned in the bill, and he expressed
himself opposed to it in every form
Mr   HARDIN began by an examination of the
claims of Georgia on the United States Govern-
ment in reference to the Indian titles to lands m
the Cnerokee country, &c , and maintained that
we were bound to filfil the engagen erts we had
made with Georgia for extingu slung those claims
It was the policy of the United States to give
them sucn a foim of goveinment as should induce
treaties with all the Indian tlioes, and make all
those tubes the true friends of the Um ed States
Such was the ob]ect of the bill     Notwithstanding
the profound respect wh ch he entertained for the
opinions  of the gefitlemen  from  Massachusetts
and Vnginia [Messrs  Adavis and Archer] on
constitutional law, he could not see the suljeci in
the same light in which they appeared to view it
Mr   H   then refei red to the act admitting the Ter    I
r'tory of Louisiana into the Government as aTer   I
tuory, foi  which the gentlenan from Mis«achu   l|
setts voted, and which was similar <n many of its i
provisions to the piesent oi e    The officers ofi
that Terntoiy were appointed by the President, I
and where was then the cry of despotism'   A id
lie would ask them wnere was the constitutional ¡
objection to this bill'   Military force was author-  ¡
ized m  the mcoiporation of Louisiana into the
Government     Why then object to i' here, where
tne Indians themselves were allow J a commind
ing voice in  its exercise'   He cou'd see no des
puiism m the matter    The opposition to the bill |
reminded him of the tuck of lawyers so often
lesorted to to sustain a bad cause                             I
1     Mr   H   said he would be happy to see a dele- I'
gate from that abused race upon this floor, and
he doubted not that nine times out often he would !
go with him     Give these tribes a government,
and a standing among nations     What more de   .1
graded the othei wise ran character of our country,
than the fate of this almost extinct race     The rem
rant of tnem left on this side of tne setting sun,
was a ¡eproach to Spain and to Europe     Whit
could mo e contribute to our glorv, than to be the
instruments of maKing a renaration, so long due,
to an injured—a persecu'ed race'    Mi  H alluded
to  the ndirect and inefficient attempts that had
.been made to civilize the Inuians, by sending mis
sionanes among them, cLc , but he would say, I
give them a government, give them property, give
them laws and hteratuie, and everything would I
follow They would then become Christians like
ourselves We owed it to Georgia to do it We
owed it to ourselves, and to our God, and he
never, in his life, voted more cheerfully for any
I bill than he should for the present     He had no
such fears as those dieaded by thetso gentlemen
who had  addiessed  the  House  that  morning   j
Wait till the time comes and then meet the contin-
gency     He hoped the bill would pass
Mi VIN TON sa d this discussion was unex-
pected to him It was a solemn subject, and he
feared the chaiactei of the bill was not piopeily
imdeistood by the House If the country was
charged with any violation of public faith, whiJi
boie with pai lcular force upon its na ioni.1 char
acter, it was this of its obligations to, and contract j
with, the aborigines The termor} included in
the bill ex ended over an immense poition of our
continent—bounded on one side by the twenty-
ninth degree of noith latitude, and extending over
thiileen degiees of longitude Heooi eutred wi'h
the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr Adims,]
that the government pioposed for this territory
was a despotisn—a military govemme it in em-
bijo
How was this territory to be governed > By a
governor and a council consisting of twenty-four
chiefs, whoweie" to be elected or seiecíeá " What
selected meant, he knew not Then it wag eon-
fined to chiefs, no othei Indian thanachief. Then
the Governor had many despotic powers. Mr
V recited the various piovisionsof the bill setting
foilh the same
Mi CLAYTON rose and iequested the Chair
to call the House to order, as the stir was so great
that, though sitting near the gentleman, he was
himself unable to hear him distinctly
Mr HUBBARD said as there was a great ex
citement pi evading m consequence of the import
ant news that had arrived, he moved that th«
House adjourn     Negatived
Mr VINTON resumed He was opposed to
the bill, becaus , in the first place, it was uncon-
stitutional, and secondly.it was anti-republican
If it was intended to foim a civil government, lie
was for the employment of civil officers only If,
howevei, the bill should be adopted, he should
move to lestnct the limits of the territory within
a smiller compass, so that it should not be larger
than one, or two, at the utmost, of the Western
Slaves
Mi CLAYTON reviewed the objections to the
bill Those of the gentleman fiom Massachusetts
[Mr Adams] were three, first, that it violated the
Gonstituuon, second, that it violated national law,
thud, that u would establish a despotism The
objection of the gentleman from Virginia [Mr
Archer] was that we were about to create a dan-
gerous confederacy, and those of the gentleman
fiom 0 no [Mi "Vinton] that the territory would
be too laige Mr C maintained that these objec-
tions were more imaginary than real He took
them up and answered them sei lalim He thought
that the General Government had the same power
over its own Territories that a State government
had over the teiruory within its own limits
They both had the light to impose what conditions
thev thought necessaiv for the legulations of the
people residing within the temtory Nor could
you stop after naving once assumed the ngi t
fhe United States Governn ent had done it in
various ways, and they had the same power to
extend their regulations as far as it deemed ex-
pedient Mi G then gave a historical outline
of the incidents ard events that had occuired be-
tween the State of Georgia and the Cherokee
Indians in that State, ¡.rid advocated the bill at
considerable length
He concluded by insisting that it was not the
object of the bill to establish a new territory or a
new government It was to secure a home to the
Indian tribes of the country &uch was the wish
antfteehng of the State of Geoigia, and, he trusted,
such would piove to be the feeling of this House
anu of this country Where, he asked, was the
evidence of all that l erevolence so often manifested
in this House' Now was the time to exert it
Now it could be plainly evinced by the passage of
this bill
Mi ADAMS rose to correct some statements
of the gentleman fiom Kentucky [Mr Huu>iM]in
íelation to the vote he gave on the admission of
the Territory of Louisiana into this Goveinment
He quoted from the Journals of the House from
1804 to 1806, (which he held in his hand,) to
prove that the course he pursued on that occasion
was directly the reverse of that attributed to him
He made a wide distinction between that case,
however, and the present This was for the ad-
mission into our Union of another race of beings,
and not the admission of white men belonging to
a foteign government
Mr FILLMORE pioposed an amendment to
the bill, which was decided then tobe out of order,
but at the solicitation of Mr T the amendment
was read Mr F was induced to offer his amend-
ment (he said) to apply particulaily to those tribes
of Indians residing in New York
This amendment not being considered m order
by the Chair,
Ml GILMER obtained leave to make some
explanatory remarks app icable to the subject to
which the amendment of Mr  P  alluded
On motion of Mi  JONES, of Georgia,
The House then adjourned
