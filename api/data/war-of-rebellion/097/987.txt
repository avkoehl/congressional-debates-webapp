Booth and Herold were traced by Baker to Garrett's barn, three miles from Port Royal, yesterday morning. They were secreted in a barn. The barn was fired. Booth, in making his escape, was killed and Herold captured. Booth's body and Herold are now here. They crossed the Potomac Saturday night or Sunday night. Their horses were left in the swamp and should be secured; also all persons who aided their concealment.
