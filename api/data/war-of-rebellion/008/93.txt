Numbers 3. Report of Surg. O. W. Nixon, U. S. Army, Medical Director.

NEW MADRID, March 16, 1862.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report to you the list of killed and wounded of your command in the recent action with the enemy intrenched at New Madrid.* The wounds, with two or three exceptions, were severe. Two died in a few hours after receiving their injuries and two others the next day. The wounded are carefully nursed, and every comfort at our command has been given them.

The different division and regimental surgeons have lost no opportunity, both on the field and in the hospital, of ministering to the comfort of the wounded.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. W. NIXON,

Acting Medical Director.

Major General JOHN POPE.
