wretched men relief. We have consequently to seek it through them of our own Government. There are also here 3,696 prisoners captured during the past spring. Most of these were taken on the battle-field and a considerable number have lost knapsacks, blankets, &amp;c. For the first-class (old prisoners) an entire suit of clothing is needed to each man, for the second (those captured in the spring) a supply of underclothing and shoes. In the course of a few months these last will require also an entire suit per man. You can best determine what to send them. There has also been much sickness among the old prisoners and it is now rapidly increasing among all. A supply of medicine is needed immediately, which cannot be procured here and without which great mortally during the summer months is almost certain to occur. We annex a schedule of the supplied asked for and most earnestly and strenuously beg that, without postponement or delay, they be forwarded to us.

We remain, sir, very respectfully, &c.,
