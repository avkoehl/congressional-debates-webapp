DEPARTMENT OF STATE,

Washington, May 27, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have the honor to transmit herewith for your information a statement in regard to the condition and designs of the rebels in Texas, taken from a communication made to our vice-consul-general at Havana by a recusant blockade-runner. From the circumstances of the case, as narrated by Mr. Savage, the Department is inclined to think it worthy of attention. The informer was in a position to know the facts, and no good reason appears to discredit his recital of them.

I have the honor to be, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.

[Indorsement.]

WAR DEPARTMENT, May 31, 1864.

Respectfully referred to Major-General Canby, commanding Military Division of West Mississippi, for his information.

By order of the Secretary of War:

LOUIS H. PELOUZE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
