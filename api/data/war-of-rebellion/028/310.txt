We have no definite news. Our telegraph operator at Hagerstown reports that a battle is progressing near the Potomac, between Sharpsburg and Williamsport. What success did McClellan meet with yesterday? We have not heard, and should know, in order to use our forces that are now being pushed into Maryland.
