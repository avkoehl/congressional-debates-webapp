ORDNANCE OFFICE, Washington, February 1, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: As directed, I submit the inclosed report of projectiles that are wanted, amounting in weight to about 15,654 tons, and will cost about $1,095,780. The number and kind of projectile in this report are based upon the whole number of cannon of all calibers required for the complete armament of the forts. These cannon, with their carriages and the implements necessary for their use in service, cannot be made nearly as fast as the projectiles. It is not advisable, in my opinion, to give orders for the manufacture of the projectiles more rapidly than the guns and carriages can be prepared, otherwise payments for them may so far exhaust the appropriations for armament of fortifications as to leave insufficient means for procuring cannon, &amp;c., in due proportion to the projectiles. I would suggest that at present orders be given for no more than one-fourth of the whole quantity wanted, leaving further orders to be given from time to time hereafter as the appropriations will admit, having due regard to the procurement of cannon and other ordnance supplies requisite for arming the fortifications.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. W. RIPLEY,

Brigadier-General.
