gade. If no raid is threatened in North MISSISSIPPI you might order Mabry's brigade back to Jackson, and General Adams would thus have command of that brigade and the troops under command of Colonel Wood. I cannot speak in too high terms of Colonel Mabry; he is one of the most gallant and best brigade commanders in the service.

Yours, respectfully,

S. D. LEE,

Lieutenant-General.

Major General N. B. FORREST,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: Permit me to mingle my congratulations with the applause of the whole country for your recent brilliant victories. I never hear of your successes that they do not arouse the most pleasurable feelings of friendly satisfaction. I was truly glad to learn that in your late engagement with the enemy at Tupelo some 300 men of my command arrived on the field in time to afford you assistance, and am highly pleased with your acknowledgment of their service. I send Major Cassell, of my brigade, to take command of the men referred to and march them back to this point. Any assistance you may render him will be gratefully appreciated by,

Truly, your friend,

JNO H. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General S. D. LEE,

Meridian:

Have you conferred with General Smith on the subject of crossing a portion of his forces over the Mississippi? The present seems to be a most favorable opportunity for such a move. From information just received it is believed to be practicable.
