THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 25,
pedite the settlement of accounts between the
General Government and the various States
of the Union.
Mr. WELKER. Mr. Speaker, I perceive
from the remarks of my friend from Indiana
[Mr. Okth] that he does not understand the
.whole import of this bill. Now, I happen to
know that upon this claim on behalf of the
State of Illinois, growing out of the very sub-
ject that is involved in this bill, the Comp-
troller of the Treasury has made a decision
adverse to the claim; and that the purpose of
this bill is to take the decision of that question
of making up the accounts in relation to these
claims from the Comptroller of the Treasury,
and to put it into the hands of the Secretary
of the Treasury himself.
Mr. ORTH. If the gentleman is correct,
what does, the committee propose? That it
shall be referred to the very officer who has
decided against the claim, as the gentleman
has said. Is the gentleman unwilling to refer it
to that officer, who has already decided against
the claim?
Mr. WELKER. It involves a larger amount
of money than I perceive he thinks is involved.
Mr. ORTH. 1 do not know how much it
involves.
Mr. WELKER. I do not think we should
pass it.
Mr. ORTH. We provide that our officers
shall make the settlement, and when that set-
tlement is made and the balance shall bo struck
it shall be paid, whichever side it may be on.
Mr. RA.UM. I wish to ask the gentleman a
question. It is provided that said account
shall be so adjusted as to place all the States
upon the same footing in regard to the adjust-
ment of their respective accounts with the
United States, of whatever nature. What is
that put in there for?
Mr. ORTH. The object of it is this: where
a settlement, for instance, has been had with
the State of Ohio, then the same basis shall be
adopted with reference to the State of Illinois;
that the same rule applied to the State of Ohio
shall be applied to Illinois.
Mr. SPALDING. Is the same rule to be
applied also to the rebellious States ?
Mr. ORTH. If any rebel State has a claim
against us for helping to put down the rebel-
lion would my friend from Ohio refuse to pay it ?
^ Mr. PAINE. During the Thirty-Ninth and
Fortieth Congresses we have had a select
committee to take charge of this subject of
war claims of the loyal States, and the effect
of this amendment of the gentleman from
Indiana is to transfer to a single officer, to
wit, the Secretary of the Treasury, to dispose
of this vast subject involving millions upon
millions of dollars. For one, sir, I am not
willing that a subject which has involved so
much labor and so much difficulty should be
intrusted to him now.
Mr. ORTH. Let me remind the gentleman
that no other officer is authorized.
if1'" ' object to further debate.
Mr. ALLISON. I move that the bill be laid
on the table.
Mr. ORTH. Let it be referred to the Com-
mittee on the Judiciary.
Mr. ALLISON. I withdraw my motion.
It was so referred.
Mr. SCOPIELD moved to reconsider the
vote by which the joint resolution was referred:
and also moved that the motion to recon-
sider be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
MESSAGE FHOM THE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate,
by lh\ Gorham, its Secretary, notifying the
House that that body had passed bills of the

PURCHASE OF HOUSE STATIONERY.
The SPEAKER also laid before the House
the following letter from the Clerk of the House
of Representatives:
Clerk's Office, House of Representatives,
United States, Washington, I). C.,
July 2>>, i&OS.
Sir: A question having been raised yesterday in
the House respecting the prices paid for writing
paper the past year, I have, on the suggestion of tho
chairman of tho Committee on Accounts, had a state-
ment prepared of the quantities purchased for tho
use of the House, tho persons from whom purchased,
the gross amounts paid, and the weight of the paper.
The statement is appended, and shows that—
French & Richa rdson furnish ed 810 reams S3,139 00
X. W. Price furnished 393} reams (litho-
graphed) for  2,781 35
Gingerly & Myers, legal cap and engrossing
paper, 150 reams foi  80180
Philp<fc Solomons, 160 reams for  7(13 40
$7,505 01
All of this was purchased under contract with the
lowest bidder, except the lithographed paper, which
cannot bo advantageously contracted tor in that way.
I may be allowed to add that under the system of
bidding- which has prevailed in this office for the last
five years, the Government has the advantage of a
separate bid tor each article, and of the active com-
petition which exists among the trade; and that I
have unofficially been informed that the joint Com-
mittee on Eetrenchment propose to makethis system
obligatory upon all branches of the public scrvice.
From the accompanying table it will be found that
our commercial note paper ranged from $2 50 to
S3 11, according to weight, letter paper from S4 47 to
85 58, according to weight, and foolscap from 85 74 to
$6 70, according to weight. These prices are believed
to be as low as the market afforded. It has been my
aim to invite competition, and secure the be*>t articles
for tho smallest amount of money; and I have rea-
son to believe that a comparison of prices will provo
that a considerable measure of success has attended
this effort.
I am, sir, very respectfullv. your obedient servant

Mr. DAWES. In connection with that letter
I desire to say that in the remarks I made yes-
terday I had not the slightest intention of im-
pugningthe integrity of the Clerk of this House,
or any^ officer of the House. I do not believe
there is a man living more honest than the
Cleik of this House. 1 spoke of an evil that
existed about the Government, and I hose the
plan adopted by the Clerk of the House will
ultimately bring about a reform of that evil
f ,lette<: was ordered to be printed and
referred to the Committee on Retrenchment
