Major-General GRANT, Jackson, Tenn.:

I approve of your plan of advancing upon the enemy as soon as you are strong enough for that purpose. The Minnesota and Wisconsin regiments should join you very soon, and the Governor of Illinois has promised ten regiments this week. I have directed General Curtis to re-enforce Helena, and if they cannot operate on Little Rock they can cross the river and threaten Grenada. I hope for an active campaign on the Mississippi this fall. A large force will ascend the river from New Orleans. General Stanley will be sent to General Rosecrans as chief of cavalry.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

LA GRANGE, TENN., November 4, 1862. - 8 p.m.

Troops from Corinth and Bolivar reached here to-day. Occupy the line of Scott Creek and Wolf River from 2 1/2 miles south of Grand Junction to a short distance west of La Grange; General McPherson commanding right wing, General Hamilton the left. Will remain here for a few days to get up stores by railroad and to reconnoiter the front perfectly. Enemy's pickets occupied this place on our arrival, and two captured bridges over Wolf River at this place are safe. General Sherman moves out from Memphis to attract attention in that direction. My moving force will be about 31,000.

Major-General GRANT, La Grange, Tenn.:

Had not troops sent to re-enforce you better go to Memphis hereafter? I hope to give you 20,000 additional men in a few days.

GENERAL GRANT'S HEADQUARTERS.

Grand Junction, Tenn., November 6, 1862.- 7 a.m.

Send sixteen regiments of infantry and all cavalry and artillery to Memphis. This will give two full divisions to move from there and leave a sufficient garrison. I want seven regiments here to fill present
