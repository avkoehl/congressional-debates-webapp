HOUSE OP REPRESENTATIVES,
Wednesday, December 20, 1837
Mr COFFIN, member elect from the State of
Ohio, appeared, was qualified, and took his scat
Mr. POPE \v as appointed on the Committee of
Ways and Means, to fill the vacancy therein
Mr. CUSHMAN moved that the House resolve
itself into a Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union, on the resolutions to refer the diffe-
rent subjects embraced in the President's Message
to appropriate standing committees  lost
The first business in order was the motion made
by Mr SLADE, on Monday, to refer two memo-
rials, presented by htm on that day, praying for the
abolition of slavery and the ¡slave trade in the Dis-
trict of Columbia to a select committee
Mr SLADE addressed the House at great
length on the subject He commenced by re-
marking that the business of the country was
transacted here, by a reference of all subjects to
their appropriate committees, and that matters ot
the most trivial nature met with no opposition to
sach reference But no 'ooner did any member
present a memorial i elating in the slightest degree
to a certain subject, the abolition of slavery, than it
wasdireetly attacked and placed under prohibition
He «aid that were he to present a petition from a con-
stituent involving the small sum of twenty dollars,
even that would not be denied a reference, inas-
much as it might involve an important principle,
but here were a large class of petitions, signed b>
hundreds of thousands, asking the action of Con-
gress on a subject of the greatest interest, and yet
they were disposed of with no ceremony at all
He then alluded to the course pursued by certain
members m opposition to such petitions, and ex-
pressed hts belief that all the movements in relation
to the subject had been preconcerted with the regu-
larity of clockwork
Mr. WISE explained that, as he had hitherto
taken upon himself to oppose the reference of such
petitions, he would say, once for all, that as far as
his knowledge was concerned, there had been no
preconcert in relation to the opposition to this sub-
ject, neither had he received any intimation fiom
the Speaker, or any one else, as to the mode of
proceeding
Mr DAWSON wished to ask the gentleman
from Vermont it he intended to include him in the
charge of preconcerting measures in opposition to
the subject
Mr SLADE disclaimed anv intention of imput-
ing dishonorable motives to the gentlemen who had
thought it their duty to adopt such a course He
would not say but that they had acted from pure
and conscientious motives, but he had stated whit
his own impression was, and what must be the
impression of all who had observed the couise pur-
sued
Mr S then made the motion to refer the memo-
rials to a select committee, with instructions to re-
port a bill providing for the abolition of slavery
and the slave trad" m the District of Columbia
Mr LEGARE hoped the gentleman from Ver-
mont would allow him to make a few lemaiks
before he pioceeded further lie sinoeielv hoped
that gentleman would consider well what he was
about before he ventured on such ground, and that
he woull take time to consider whit might he its
probib'e consequences He solemnly  ntipitcd
him to reflect on the possible íesults of such a
course, which involved the interests of a nation and
a continent He would warn him, not in the lan-
guage of de6ance, which all brave and wise men
despised, but he would warn han in the language
of a solemn sense of duty, that if there was " a spi-
rit aroused in the North in relation to this subject,"
that spirit would encounter another spirit m the
South full as stubborn He would tell them that,
when this question was forced upon the people of
the South, they would be ready to take up the
gauntlet He concluded bv urging on the gent'e-
man I rom Vermont to ponder well on his cour e
before he ventured to proceed
Mr SLADE again resumed his íemarks, and
aftar proceeding for some time, he entered into an
argument touching the subject of slavery in the
State of Virginia, and w as about to read a paper
on the same subject, whereupon
Mr WISE mt^iposed, and siid that the gentle-
man had been discussing slav^iv in the South,
slavery in the State of Virginia, slaver} m his dis-
trict, and he now asked his colleagues to retire w ith
him from that hall
Mr HOLSEY made the same request to his col-
leagues from Georgia, and expressed a hope that the
whole southein delegation would retire
Mi GRANTLAND also joined in the same
wish
Mr  RHETT     The whole of the delegation of
South Carolina has already signed an agreement
Mr ROBERTSON    One remark, Mr Speaker
Mr SLADE    I claim the floor
The CHAIR    Does the  gentleman from Vir-
ginia rise to a question of order'
Mi ROBFRTSON No, sir I wish to make
one observation
Mr RHETT    I rise to a point of order
Mr ROBERTSON    I wish simplv to propose
to the Southern delegation—
Mr RHETT I n-e to a point oí order The
question of order r-, whethei the memoei from
Vermont has a right to go into the consideration of
slavery in the State of Virginia 1 I say he has not,
and if it is insisted upon, I request the whole
Southern delegation to go into the room of the
Committee for the District of Columbia.
The CHAIR reminded the House that he had
repeatedly interposed when  the gentleman from
Vermont had been going into the question of slavery
in the States He was not permitted to give his
own opinions, but they might readuy be inferred by
the House He felt it his duty to state, that if it
were possibly in his power to allav excitement, and
to prevent discussions of this sort, he would do it.
Mr. TURNEY rose, he said, to a question of
order
Mr SLADE I ask leave to read a paper, and
to state what that paper is
Mr GRANTLAND. I object to the readmg of
it
The CHAIR. The gentleman will take his
seat
Mr JOHNSON of Maryland Will it be in
order, Mr Speaker, to take the sense of the House
whether the member from Vermont shall be per-
mitted to proceed1
The CHAIR replied negatively
Mr McKAY Mr Speaker, has not the mem-
bei from Vermont been declared out ot order'*
The CHAIR     He has
Mr McKAY    Then has he a right to proceed''
The CHAIR No gentleman has raised that
question
Mr McKAY Th°n, sir, I make that que-tion.
I object to his proceeding I object to his resum-
ing his remarks, and I hope the House will not
permit him
The CHAIR then, under the rule, directed Mr.
Si adf to take his seat, -nd pronounced the gentle-
man out of order for discussing the question of sla-
very in the State of Virginia Referring to the 22d
rule, the Chair added that the gentleman could no
longer proceed without the leave of the House, and
he was about to propound the question, when
Mr SLADE said he wished to state the posi-
tion m w hich he stood I propose, said he, to read
a smg'e paper------
M- TURNED 1 object to t'" ocmleman's
proceeding at all
The CHAIR said the rule was imperative The
gentleman could not proceed, under the question
made by Mr McKay, without leave of the House
Mr SLADE The question now is, whether it
is in order for me to ask for th  reading of a paper.
The CHAIR The other question is also before
the House, and must be decided by its vote, with-
out debate
Mr SLADE I ask if I am out of order while
proceeding with the leave of the House, going on
for ?tleast twenty minutes, and then merely asking
lene to ie?d a piper
TI  C H \IR sta'e-, that his p raer to (opimence
was «h n the quest on oí older was made. There-
after, the mk wis imperative, duectmg its de-
cision without debite
Mr SLADE, (who wis still on his feet) Mr
Speaker—
The CHAIR    The gentleman will take his seat
Mi SLADE then p'edged himself, if the House
would permit him to lesume, not to discuss the
question of slaverj in the Slates
Tne CHAIR then propounded the question to
the House that the gemieman fiom Vermont have
leave to proceed
Mr ALLEN asked for the yeas and nays, which
were ordered
Ml   RENCHER moved that the House adjourn.
Mr SLADE asked for the yeas and nays, which
were ordered, and were—veas 106, nays63
Mk CAMPBELL then gave notice that the
southern delegations were then assembled in the
room of the Committee for the Disaict of Columbia,
and he said he «as instructed by their committee
to request the attendance of all gentlemen repre
senting slaveholding mteiests on that floor imme
diately
