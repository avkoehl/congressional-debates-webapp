UNION CORRESPONDENCE, ETC.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, January 1, 1863.

Colonel J. C. KELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

I have the honor to send herewith copy of my reply* to Major-General Holmes' letter of the 7th ultimo, in which, by direction of his commander-in-chief, he asks full information in regard to the execution of ten men, by order of Brigadier-General McNeil, Missouri State Militia, some time since in Northeastern Missouri.

The question is one of some delicacy, and I hope my solution of it will meet the approval of the General-in-Chief.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

NORTHERN MISSOURI, January 1, 1863.

His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN,

President of the United States:

Your memorialists, loyal citizens of the United States and of the State of Missouri, respectfully represent that, since the outbreak of the present rebellion, Northern Missouri, in common with the southern part of the State, has been infested by hordes of lawless depredators, popularly, known as guerrillas, though styling themselves "Confederate soldiers," led by desperate and unprincipled men, having not even the form of official commissions from the authorities of the so-called Confederate States, and whose modes of warfare have been only those resorted to and practiced by highway robbers, thieves, murderers, and assassins. Not having from any source a recognition as belligerents, they have, nevertheless, not scrupled to wage relentless war against the Government of the United States and of the State Missouri, and against the peace, safety, and happiness of the loyal citizens of this State.
