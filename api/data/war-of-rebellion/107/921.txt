Major General A. E. BURNSIDE:

GENERAL: The following dispatch has just been received from Pleasonton:

I have been fighting Stuart all day. He is retreating by Ashby's Gap, but his train is going the road to Manassas Gap. I don't think there are any rebels this side nearer than Manassas. Have seen no infantry to-day. Please say to the general commanding that I shall push a force toward Manassas this evening; also that Stoneman's cavalry should cover Aldie and Hopewell Gap.

A. PLEASONTON.

The general desires that you give the necessary order to Stoneman.

Brigadier General A. PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

GENERAL: Couch's corps is ordered to Paris and vicinity to-day; Burnside to Upperville and vicinity; Stoneman to Middleburg; Reynolds to Bloomfield and Union. Porter remains at Snickersville. I would be glad to have you make a strong reconnaissance toward Ashby's Gap, to ascertain whether it is occupied and by what force. If it is not, please send a strong party through, to ascertain what is going on near Millwood. Having accomplished this, oir at the same time if practicable, I would like to have a reconnaissance made in the direction of Springfield, Manassas Gap, and Front Royal. It may be necessary to employ Bayard's force in this expedition; if so you will please meet him and arrange the details. As soon as possible some cavalry, perhaps Stoneman's should occupy White Plains, in order to cover the Hopewell Gap. Headquarters will probably be at Bloomfield to-night. Some of the enemy are in sight from Snicker's Gap, near Berryville. and this side of it. Wagon trains visible.

Truly, yours,

G. B. MCCLELLAN,
