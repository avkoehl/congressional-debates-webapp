No. 3. Reports of Major General Stephen D. Lee, C. S. Army, commanding Department of Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana.

DEMOPOLIS, May 11, 1864.

(Received 17th).

There are two raids out in MISSISSIPPI - one 2,000 under McArthur, moving from Vicksburg toward Benton, was checked by General Adams; the other, from Memphis, under Sturgis, four regiments of infantry and three of cavalry, now at Lamar. These movements are mostly to draw off troops from our armies and need not be feared.

Major-General.

GENERAL: A raiding party from Vicksburg of infantry and cavalry moved on the Central railroad, and while General Adams was fighting their main body near Pickens Station a cavalry force burnt Vaughan's men of Wood's regiment, handsomely repulsed two regiments of infantry from the railroad bridge and saved it. The enemy retreated to Yazoo City. The railroad but slightly injured.

CANTON, May 9, 1864.

After two days' heavy skirmishing with the enemy he has been checked in his advance toward the Central road, and is now at Benton, from which place I think he will return to Vicksburg.
