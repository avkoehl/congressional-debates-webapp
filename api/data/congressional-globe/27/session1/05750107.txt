trustees to those who may hereaiter, and that at no i
very dibtant time,, be enrolled under your banners I
m defence of your rights?
I now ask the attention of the committee to the
gross inequality of one o' the provi ions of this
bill It lb provided that 10 per ctnt more of the
moneys raised from these land?, shall be paid to
some of the new States, than to the old States Is
this equitable? What right has Indiana or any
other State to receive 10 per cent more that New
York? What has New York done that she should
not receive the same quota as Indiana1! Look to
the population of New York, and judge what miast
be the consumption of articles on uhich you lay a
tax in your import duties—then calculate how
much greater is her share of contribution in mak-
ing up any deficiency in the Trea ury than any
new Slate with a «eattered population You re-
fuse to give to the S'ate her equal shire in a di
vision ot pubhc moneys, while her pe pie must, by
taxation, contribute the largen am unt of money
to your coffers Can injustice go farther mtp
pre smg a y people' Does it become the majon y
of this Houie to sanction such mjus ice ?
I contess my astonishment at the support given
to this treasure by  meofbeis professing to be at-
tached to the S ate Rights interest      S r, I believe
that in the sovereignty of the States rest, the per-
manency of this Union     Ii this b 11, openly on its

SPEECH OF MR. PICKENS,
OF SOl/TH CAROL A,
In the House of Represenlauvts, Juty 8, 1841—On
the bill authorizing a loan not exceeding twelve
millions of dollars
The pending question being on the motion to
strike out the enacting clause of the Dill-
Mr PR KENS addressed die com Utee 'nop- [
position to the b 11 He did not de<ire, he said, to
trespai-s on she at'ention of the coomutiee He
knew how great the di<p siti n was to hurry busi-
ness through, and he knew that there was a great
indisposition on he part both of the House ana the
committee to consider suen btlU as these During
the whole pen id oi his >-erv ce here, he had been
struck with ¡he remarkable faot that on all money
questions, upon all bi K involvng gppropripnons
cf thp public money, there wai ¡see apathy and
indifference, and less consideration, in this House,
than on any other measures He did not know why
this was, but such was the fact And >et, if any
measu es were more important than other1., they
certainly were those wSich related to the finances of
the country, an' the mode and marner of raising
the wajs and me ms to meet ihe exigences and ex
pendes of  he Government
Weha/e been taught to believe that there is
nothing more imp r ant to ihe people ¡a the affairs
of Government than the exercise of the taxing
power This might be a p ejulre, but if it were,
we hid inherited it from ourancesto", and from
tie crouuest recollectitn„ of pan history. Al

th' English language—the} had been taught to
b-liev? that the line whici separated the power of
Go< eminent from priva e property, was the line
mat defined English and American liber y And
the true and real mode by which to jucge of the
privilege*and liber res of a people was the power
they had to control ana restrain taxation by Go-
vernment Connectea wiio this suoject, the>-e *as
another question as deeply interesting a? toe power
of taxa un, and that was the mode and manner in
which íevenue should be expended There is ns
opera'ion connected wi'h (government that pro-
duces so ?rrat an effec' upon the distribution of
Rational wealth a  t e mode an I manner in which
its íevenues aro disbursed or disposed of As
deeply important as mis, consideration must be to
all nations, j et it is mo e so to us as a free people
tiiai to any o he- Our coant'/ pte^ents the most
extensive territory—near t o thousard miles North
and South, and the same East an 1 West—embrac-
ing all variety of productions, altmst from the
irozen to the torrid zone\ with various and com-
plicated local in wests, and twenty six separate lo-
cal Governments. No statesman can look at these
things without seeing at once the profound impres-
sion ihat must ba produced, in the course of time,
upon tha distribution of wealth by cot only the
collections of our revenue, but, m a far .greater de-
gree, by the disbursements of that revenue. Hence
it is, that every tax bill, or loan b II, or any mea-
sure touching the fiscal action of this Government,
must always produce a deep sensation throughout
tae Republic.
In England the thing was somewhat different.
There  they had a very small  territory, with a
dense population and a perfect identity of interest
Hence it was that the British Government could
collect two hundred millions of dollars in revenue
without producing any very great imprassion upon
the distribution ot wealth, .because that revenue
was di^bur ed again amonsst the same people.   It
might affect classes and individuals, but as far as
her  resjurceo as a nation were concerned—her
capiial, h r labor, her productive industry were
involved—it   produced   litlle or  no  impression
Collecting two hundred millions from a small te*1"
tory, with a dense population and identity of inte-
rests, and then spending or disbursing the same
back again amongst precisely the same peopk and
upon ihe '•ame territory, comparatively s/eakmg,
impaired but little their íesources, and produced
but little effect upon  the distribution of national
wealth    Such a people might sustain an immense
national debt and the heaviest expenditures of Go-
vernment     But it was not so with us  Takeform-
stanee Arkansas and Massachusetts—two States of
this Confederacy, near fifteen hundred miles apart,
with very diffetent productions and pursuits.   The
question as to taxation  may present itself in very
diflei^iit aspect   to tho«e 'wo States, and particu-
larly when you connect the questiin as to the mode
, rid ma iter 11 f hich the revenue from that taxa-
ii n sha 1 be disbursed      Although you may sup-
pose ih  t bo h States may contribute in exact pro-
portit n to populatio i (a proposition by no means
¡rue)  towarls  that revenue, yet if one receive 
more in  disbursements and  the other less than it
c mtnbutes, you at once see that taxation connect-
ed vsi h disbursements may be, as far as money is
ct ncerned, a gam  to one and ? loss to the other.
h< this point of view, taxat on and a national debt
may be a ole^ing to one State, whilst they are a
constant draw and a curse to another Sute.   If,
mthecourst of 20 >ears' opeiation, the Govern-
ment were to collect 450 m Uioes of dollars from
the whole Confederacy by taxation, and were  to
exp nd 300 millions of it back on one section, and
that the smallest section,  is it not palpable, as far
as the distribution of national wealth is involved,
that t ere is a difference of 150 millions in the ope-
ration?   Suppose  that there should be two great
sections of the Confederacy  (and I will only sup-
pose  the cas  merely for illustration)  and both
should con nbuie one half, or 225 millions apiece
towvids the  450  millions—and that one should
receive back in Disbursements the 300 millions—
and t! eclhei only 150 millions—do you not see that
a  far . s tne pe< uni >ry operation is concerned that
the oie will receive back 75 millions more than it
p?id, whil-t the  other would lose exactly 75 mil-
lions?
But, than, suppose that by a peculiar system  of
indirect taxat on you were to make one section
contribute through its exchangeahle products three
hundred m llions, and the other one hundred and
fifty millions, and then that jou were to disburse
back to the latter fhre  hundred and  to the former
one hundred and fifty, then the loss to one would
b   precisely one hundred and fifty millions, and the
gam «o the o her one hundred and fifty. No^.when
\ou take taxation and disbursement together, this
is, to a great extent, the operation.    Hence it is,
hat it is contrary to the genius of our system to
bear a high rate of taxation or disbursement.   Not
that ihere i= any objection to paying what is right
for the support of Govern meat, or to contribute
reely for all those just purposes prescribed by the
Constitution—not that there is any  objection to
contributing our last dollar for the defence of the
interests or the rights  of our common country—
but that we should be cautious and forbear to make
any unnecessar/  exactions—that we should  at-
tempt, as tar as possible, to preserve justice and
equality, and to be sure and take not a cent from
