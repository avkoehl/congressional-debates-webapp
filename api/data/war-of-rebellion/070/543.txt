WASHINGTON, D. C., May 26, 1864-10.20 a.m.

Major-General HUNTER, Valley of the Shenandoah:

General Grant is between the North and South Anna. He wishes you to push on if possible to Charlottesville and Lynchburg and destroy railroad and canal beyond possibility of repair for weeks, then either return to your original base or join Grant via Gordonsville. In your movements live as much as possible on the country.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CHIEF QUARTERMASTER'S OFFICE, DEPARTMENT OF WEST VIRGINIA, May 26, 1864-10 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel HALPINE,

Asst. Adjt. General, Headquarters in the Field:

COLONEL: A courier from a detachment of cavalry sent to escort a return train from the front has reported that Mosby is in the vicinity of the pike with 400 men, watching the movements of trains. The train that started this morning, in consequence of this, will be delayed. A battalion of the Fifth New York Heavy Artillery (as infantry) are now en route to the front. The colonel commanding has been directed by Colonel Maulsby, commanding post, to take charge of the train, and has authority to regulate it progress, and to permit it to proceed rapidly, solely with the cavalry escort, when in his opinion it will be prudent so to do.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. V. BARRINGER,

Captain and Chief Quartermaster, Dept.of W. Virginia.

Until I receive further orders I will be governed by Special Orders, No. 102, from the general commanding the department. I have not yet received any orders or instructions from the War Department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,F. SIGEL,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 26, 1864-10.50 a.m.

The order of the Secretary of War did not make you independent of the orders of the commanding general of the Department of West Virginia. You were directed to take charge of the defense of the railroad in his absence, but of course subject to his orders, whenever he could communicate with you.
