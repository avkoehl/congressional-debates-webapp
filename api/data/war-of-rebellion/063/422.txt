HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., May, 3, 1864.

Colonel J. H. MOSS,

Commanding Sub-District, Liberty, Mo.:

COLONEL: I am in receipt of your communication of 2nd instant, inclosing telegram from General Rosecrans. I am not in possession of additional information relating to rebel and bushwhacking movements, excepting a dispatch from the general that Quantrill was about to make a raid from the Des Moines River. I can hardly credit this report, but think General Rosecrans believes, it. I have not been apprehensive of trouble in your sub-district if the south side of the Missouri should be well cared for. I regard your conclusion as sound, and shall so advise General Rosecrans. I have not the troops to place another company in your sub-district. You must call out enough of the right kind of militia to care well for your bailiwick. General Rosecrans' telegraphic order to you covers the whole ground. I will write you more fully to-morrow.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., May 3, 1864.

Colonel A. J. BARR,

51st Regiment Enrolled Missouri Militia, Richmond, Mo.:

COLONEL: The general commanding directs me to say that he has taken measures to have the company at Richmond filled up at once; also that he may want others from your regiment if the prediction of the people is fulfilled, and the guerrillas appear with the coming of the leaves. Nothing but the most active of measures will rid the State of them this season.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. T. CLARKE,

First Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF NORTH MISSOURI,Saint Joseph, Mo., May 3, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel DRAPER,

Macon City, Mo.:

I have the following order from General Rosecrans received by telegraph and transmitted to you by telegraph this day. I now communicate the same by letter:
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., May 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

Secretly take about 100 picked men of the Ninth Missouri State Militia, divided into squads of 20, and put them after Jackman's band. Your troops must go at this work with great secrecy, and persist and kill the robbers. Disguised only, they can learn nothing. They are spotted and reported from the time they start, and instead of entrapping are themselves deceived. They must do better.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
