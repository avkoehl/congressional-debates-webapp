HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,June 28, 1862.

COMMANDING GENERAL OF THE CONFEDERATE FORCES, or

The COMMANDING OFFICER:

Doctor Swinburne, a volunteer surgeon, with a number of the surgeons, nurses and attendants have been left in charge of the sick and wounded of this army who could not be removed. Their humane occupation commends itself under the laws of nations to the kind consideration of the opposing forces. It is requested that they may be free to return as soon as the discharge of their duties with the sick and wounded shall permit, and that the same consideration shown to the Confederate sick, wounded and medical officers who have been captured by our forces may be extended to theirs. A large amount of clothing, bedding, medical stores, &amp;c., have been left both at Savage Station and Doctor Trent's house.

By command of Major-General McClellan:

CHAS. S. TRIPLER,

Surgeon and Medical Director, Army of the Potomac.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, June 28, 1862.

N. H. BRAINARD, Secretary, &c., Iowa City, Iowa.

SIR: Your letter of the 21st is received. General Beauregard refuses to exchange prisoners except on terms which our Government will not admit. It is therefore impossible to reorganize the prisoners at Nashville and exchange them for future service till their officers can be released. Under these circumstances the Secretary of War has sent paymasters to pay them off and discharge them. It is the only thing that can now be done for them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

SIR: Yours of the 25th instant duly received. The requirements therein will be immediately complied with. The Gratiot Street Prison, in this city, is the principal place west of the Mississippi where prisoners of war are confined. There are local provost-marshals in nearly every county in this State, some of whom hold a few prisoners for trial. They all, however, report to this office and their returns can be consolidated here. The hospitals in the city are as follows: New House of Refuge, Fifth Street (city general hospital), Fourth Street, Hickory Street,
