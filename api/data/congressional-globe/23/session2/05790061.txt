ments, that would seem to contiadict what hes
been advanced—such as the battles of Bennington
and King's Mountain, but when we look at the

RELATIONS WITH FRANCE
Mr CLAY said he held m his hand a resolu-
tion, to which he desired to call the attention of
the Senate for a moment It would be recollected
that that pait of the President's annual message
which applied to our Fiench affairs had been re
forred to the Committee on Foieign Relations
After this refeience, the committee thought it
necessary, to the proper discharge of their duty
in this p irticulai, to bo put in possession of the
instructions which had been given to our Minister
in Prance on this subjeit, and also all the corre
spondence which had been exchanged between
the two Governments with i elation to it Under
this view of the case, a letter was prepared by
direction of the committee, and tiansmitted to the
Secretaiy of State, requesting that the necessary
mfoimation might be communicated This lettei
was very piomptly replied to by the Secretary,
covering the ínfoimation sought foi, but accom
paried with a íequest that it should be considered
confidential by the committee But it seemed to
the committee that, as the opinion and recom-
mendation of the Piesident on the subject had
been made public, the committee could not act
upon documents which were only confidentially
communicated The Secietary of State, in hn
letter, suggested an application to the President,
m the usual wav, and he had accordingly drawn
up this resolution, but which he would not press
upon the consideiation of the Senate now, as a
wish had been exoiessed to him to that efftct by
a gentleman who desired to examine it
Mi   C  then submitted the resolution, as fol
lows

communicate to the Senate (if, in his opinion, it
