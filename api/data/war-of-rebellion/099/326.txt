Captain W. L. M. BURGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Department of the South:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor respectfully to suggest that a small number of marine boat howitzers (Dahlgren) would be exceedingly valuable in this command. If this meets with the approval of the major-general commanding, and the howitzers can be obtained from the navy depot at Hilton Head, I would request that they be sent up here with the requisite supply of ammunition (shell and canister) as soon as possible.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,
