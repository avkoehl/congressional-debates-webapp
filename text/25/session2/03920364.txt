ment of a Vice Royalty, and the intiuduction c f a
British army to sustain it, must sensibly affect our
foreign exchanges, as they have done aheady
This is no temporary aid The Government now

would have been well, too, hid these issociations

simple ant1 just proposition has been wisely appre-

rJhe irec banking la.v of JSew i oik must not
on'y affect sensibly the hade ol the Union, hut
operate more powerfully than a1! our legislative
experiments, State or Federal, upon the exchanges,
and local cuirenctes of the Slates Trade, which
can alone regulate exchanges, has been chained
down by lestnctions at the centre of its power and
of our c relations. New York has been, from the
commencement of out Go\eminent, the victim of
unju«t and oppressive legislation, State and Fedc
ral Tins Government ñas nade two exper ments
—in 1791' and m 1816—la create an artificial cen
tro ot trade and cnculation It has attempted by
the incte power of law to p'ice tne eotrmeieial
reietiopols ot the Union—the natural cer-tie and
regalati r ot if? e<cT>n«es and commercial system
__under  th"  conliol   and  direction   of a Federal
hanker-geneial While v.e were thus (rented by
tin Federal Govemmeit, our own Sitie Govern-
mert denied us even "he humble privilege of de-
fending ourselves We were not permitted to ex-
ercise our natural right to íegulate the a'nounl of
our banking capital.     The   State   Government
usuiped this office, and we were only allowed to
employ about one fifth of the amount neces-
sary to sustain our own credit, and the exchanges
of the Union When our periodical revulsions
came, the piessuie of our credits did not fall upon
the point selected by the Federal Government, bat
the whole commercial system of the United States
pressed upon New York, the natural centre of ex-
changes We had no banking cap tal adequate to
the pressure, and tiade was prostrated. We are
now free Banking will hen after keep pace with
and regulate all other trades, and increase ma ratio
to the accumulation of wealth, and enlargement of
commercial credit Prepared at the natural centre
of trai'e with a broad foundation ol banking capi-
tal, we shall be ready to receive the pressure of
cummcical credit, and to moderate the shock of
every revulsion. We need no < bartered regulator
State ot Federal Our own banking law, the per-
petual enarler ol fiee tiade, is ail we require to bid
defiance to all hostility, protect ourselves, and re-
gulate exchanges. It is for our interest and the in-
terest of the country that the Federal Government
should never aaain untie banking with legislation,
and th it it should confine itself to its constitutional
duty ol regulating the coinage, and preserving a
broad a id ;olu! basis foi the local curreneres ol our
confederacy
With such evidences of a íevival of confidence,
«nd Lade, andan increase of revenue, and with
outstanding resources more than equal to any
amount we now require, we are not authorized to
resort to lo ms, oi to make any other than a lempo-
riry use of our credit, by carrying into effect the
Treasury note act of October last As to the sale
of the two bonds of the Bank of the United States,
even if practicable at all lo dispose of bonds of
Hie denomination of two millions each, it would
not answer the purpose of this bill, nor, at this
time, arTotd any relief whatever to the Treasury.
TheTieasuiy will haveeollecledasufficient amount
of its postponed debts to pay ofl all the Treasury
notes, before the amount could bereahzed from the
sale of these bonds That proposition is not de-
signed, however, to inteifere with this bill, for it is
admitted not to be the measure the Tieasury now
íequ.res Should s ich sale be authorized and ef-
fected, it will, however, so fai diminish the amount
oí Treasury notes lo be issued.
The measure piop >sed is the only erne apphca-
bli to the actual conditio i ol the Treasury. I
am aware of, and jusily appreciate, the genet al ob-
jections to Treasury notes. I concur with gentle-
men, that v-here there is a deficiency of usources,
Treasury notes ought not to be substituted for <i
direct loan We aie not, however, m that condi-
tion, and aie not, therefore, justified m creating a
public debt Ticas try notes 0( I10 denomination
should he rssued to raise money, when there areno
immediate resources < xisting lo redeem them
They never should he iisiied ol small denomina-
tion to circuLlc as cmrency These notes aie not
design d lot either ol these purposes We have
reso trees in hand to ledeem them, and notes of fKfy
dollars an 1 upwards cannol interfere with the cir-
culation of our cuín nt com
Our case, sir, is simply the wc are to receive
before the c'ose of the yeai a sufficient amount
from the banks and the merchants to redeem all
the notes we may authorize, and we piopose to
make a tempoiary Us*, of our credit to avoid the
necessity ol a loan, for which we have no occasion
whatever We only ask the benefit of the Trea-
sAiiy Note act of October last Upon a question of
such obvious expediency I shall no longer detain
the committee
Mr CUSHHSG said he re|oiced to perceive that
trade v as reviving, and that the banks were re-
suming specie payments, and he deprecated the
action of any banks to resist the resumptron of
specie payments for p( 1 tical or other purpose'
He lefened to the observation of Mr CiMBar-
itNo that Ihe measutes of the Government had
produced tins effect, and inquired what the Go-
vernment had done l© promote a revival of trade,
or to aid or encourage the banks lo resume the
payment of specie He said that after the Go-
vernment had found itself m a deplorable minori-
ty, the gentleman from. Ohio, [Mr. Himer,] had
1 offered a resolution declaring that the Government
wonld give aid to such banks as íJiauid resume.
He FMr. C.J had offered a similar resolution, but
both had í>eé¡í rejected by the rotes ol the friends of
the Administration.
He referred to the action of the State of New
York, and especially to the private banking act
of that State, and contended that the final effect
was doubtful. The measure might be prosperous—
he hoped it would, but it might be adverse, and
no one could yet tell which, and he argued, that
the private banking act, so fur from being a sepa-
ration of the banks and the Government, was
entirely the reverse. The Comptroller wai autho-
rized to issue Government bank notes to ihe private
banking corporations, upon a pledge of security to
the State for their redemption, and if the banking
company failed to redeem them, the Government
undertook to do it, out of the securities placed in
their hands; and that act constituted the Comp-
troller the greatest banker and Ihe greatest Govern-
ment banker be had ever known The Comptroller
was allowed to issue these notes of the Stale, to the
amount of millions, under his own sole control, and
and he considered the act a reunion, a remair.age,
under the strictest matrimonial bands, betweenGo-
vernment and banks. He referred to two bibs here-
tofore reported for the issuing of Treasury note?,
and expressed a desire to know what was to be done
with them. One of them was intended to authorize
what he called loan certificates, payable at a fu-
ture day, and, while they could be issued as-a legal
tender to public creditors-, they would be refused in
payment of duties and for the public lands, which
might, at the same time, be exacted, and, m fact,
collected m specie
Mr. CAMBRELENG said these bills had been
recommitted and abandoned by ihe committee as
not necessary in th present state of the country.
The committee had come to the conclusion that the
bill before the committee was all that the exigency
now required
Mr CUSIIING said he was glad to be inform-
ed oí that fact, and then went on to comment, upon
the remark that the present bill was simple lie
said it was simple, and that was an objectionable
feature. Somethings, m appearance simple, were
found in their operation to oe exceedingly com-
plex. The Secretary oí the Treasujy was to be
authorized to issue ten millions of Treasury notes,
and he could not understand under what limita-
tions or restitutions. He wished the bill to be ex-
plicit and guarded, that he might be able to under-
stand the limits of the power ot the Treasmy. He
contended that the measure proposed nad always
been consielcred of a doubtful and dLtngcrous cha-
racter by all the fuends of democratic institu-
tions, and that Madison and others had always
been opposed to issues of Government paper,
founded not on funds or specie, but upon
faith or credit, and only consented to its
expediency in remarkable exigencies He con-
sidered lhat the notes would be a currency, as
much as bank notes They would be issued to
pass from hand to hand, in the payment of deott.,
and would, m eiTeel, be money, and would enit<■
into the system of exchanges But he objected to
such issues, because they would always tnnd to de-
preciate. Experience had shown that whatever in-
terest they might bear, whether one mill or six per
cpnt. they would net be above the value of the
notes of good banks These notes would be useful
in the payment of duties, and so were notes of
specie-paying bames, which would be equally as
valuable The interest, he contended, would not
enhaiicc their value He had also doubts whether
the Government had the constitutional right to issue
bills of credit, loi he maintained that these Trea-
sury notes were bills of credit. They were not a
loan, but only an issue of paper, fo mdedon nothing
but the faith and credit oí the ¿fwernment, against
whiih the constitutional objectrou holds good
Mr C sud he was not prepared 'o decde that
this w'?s not die best expedient m the exigency of
the times lie wishel lor information, and trusted
it would be given to him in the eours" of the de-
bate. But there were other plans to relieve Ihe
Government from its pecuniary embarrassment,
and he alluded to the proposition to self the bond
