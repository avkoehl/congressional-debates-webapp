try and the vindication ofits honor, with the same
zeal and alacrity that it guards the hearthstone
and the fireside. Wherever Freedom has unfurled
her banner, the men who have rallied around to
sustain and uphold it have come from the work-
stop and the field, where, mured to heat and to
cold, and to all the inclemencies of the seasons,
they have acquired the hardihood necessary to en-
dure the trials and privations of the camp. An
independent yeomanry, scattered over our vast
domain, is the best and surest guarantee for the
perpetuity of our liberties; for their arms are the
citadel of a nation's power, their hearts the bul-
warks of liberty. Let the public domain, then,
be set apart as the patrimony of labor, by pre~«
venting its absorption into large estates by cap-
ital, and its consequent cultivation by " tenants
and slaves," instead of independent freeholders.
The proposition to change our land policy, so
as to accomplish so desirable a result, by securing
to the pioneer a liorcie on the public domain at the
bare cost of survey and transfer, is often rejected
by those who have given but little thought to the
subject as leveling and agrarian. When was there
ever an effort made, since the world began, to wrest
from power its ill-gotten gains, or to restore to
man his inalienable rights, but it has bet-n met
with the shout of leveling and agrarian ? That is
the alarm cry of the devotee of the past, with
which he ever strives to prevent all reforms or
innovations upon established usages. Behind
such a bulwark old abuses intrench themselves,
and attempt to maintain their position by hurling
against every assailant terms of odiutn and re-
proach, made so by the coloring of the adherents
of prerogative ana power. Until within a very
' recent period the chroniclers ofthe race have been,
for the most' part, sycophants of the reigning
classes; and, being allied with the State, have
glossed over its cotemporoneous despotism^ and
wrongs, while they have branded the true defend-
ers of the rights of the people, and the champions
of honorable labor, as the outlaws of history.
Because the Roman Gracchi proposed to ele-
vate the Roman citizen, by dignifying his labor
and restoring him to the rights ot which he had
been unjustly deprived by tin; oligarchy who con-
trolled the State, their name was made synony-
mous with infamy—as arch disturbers ol all that
was good in society, till Niebuhr tore oft the
vail of two thousand years of obloquy, and vin-
dicated to future times their memories as true
defenders of the rights of the# people, and advo-
cates of the best interests and glory of their coun-
try. Such has been the fate of the world 's re-
formers. Is it not time that we learned wisdom
from the chronicles ofthe past, and ceased a blind
reverence for customs or institutions, because of
their gray age ? "YV11 y should not the A.nieiican
statesman adapHhe legislation of the country to
the development of its material resources, the
promotion ofits industrial interests, and thereby
dignify its labor, and make strong the prime ele-
ments of national power ?
Let this vast domainr then, be set apart and
consecrated as a patrimony to the sons of toil;
close your land office forever against the specu-

| addition to all the other disadvantages that ever
beset tile unequal struggle between the bones and
'sinews of men and dollers and cents, what won-
der is it that misory and want so often sit at his
fireside, and penury and sorrow surround his
deathbed ?
While the pioneer spirit goes forth into the wil-
derness, snatching new areas from the wild beast
