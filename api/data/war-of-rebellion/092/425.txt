aide-de-camp, and T. C. Vidal, signal officer, did their duty nobly, and assisted in rallying at the front and leading forward those troops who, unable to stand the terrible fire of the enemy, were repulsed in the assault.

In the reports of brigade commanders, herewith inclosed, you will find personal mention of other officers. The medical department, under direction of Surg. George S. Burton, Third Rhode Island Artillery, proved itself highly efficient, and the corps of stretcher-bearer visited thoroughly all parts of the field where the troops were engaged. A list of the casualties accompanies this report. The total killed, wounded, and missing is 746. Of the 28 missing, I have been indirectly informed that 13 unwounded and 5 wounded men are in the hands of the enemy.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO P. HATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
