miscellaneous appropriation bill.
The House resolved itself into Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union, (Mr.
Wbteeler in the chair,) and proceeded to con-
sider the bill (H. R. No. 2705) making appro-
priations for sundry civil expenses of the Gov-
ernment for the fiscal year ending June 30,
1873, and for other purposes.
The CHAIRMAN. By order of the House
all general debate on the bill is terminated,
and the first reading of the bill has been dis-
pensed with. It will now be read by the Clerk
by paragraphs for amendment.
The Clerk proceeded to read the bill by-
paragraphs, and read the following, under the
head of " revenue-cutter service:"
For rations for crews: nine hundred and forty-
two petty officers, seamen, cook3, stewards, boys,
eoal-passers; and firemen, 344,772 rations, at thirty-
four cents, including liquor equivalent, $117,222 48.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I desire
to ask the chairman of the Committee on Ap-
propriations what ia the amount of the liquor
equivalent here provided for? The bill pro-
vides for a ration at thirty-four cents including
liquor equivalent.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. In making that
provision we follow the law. This has always
been allowed.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I offer
the following amendment:
In line forty-sis, after the word " thirty," strike
out the word "four," and after the word cents"
strike out the words " including liquor equivalent;"
so that it will read :
For rations for crews: nine hundred and forty-two
petty officers, seamen, cooks, stewards, boys, coal-
passers, and firemen, 344,772 rations, at thirty cents,
$117,222 48.
This will have the effect of leaving the
rations in the marine service the same as
the Army rations.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. The gentleman
from Massachusetts [Mr. Butler] will ob-
serve that in striking out the words " liquor
equivalent" he does not strike out any liquor.
When there was a ration of rum or whisky,
it was reckoned at a certain price in money.
When the grog was abolished, in fixing the
rations, an equivalent in money or in some
other form was given to those in the service.
If the gentleman wants to have it in money,
let him put it so. But I presume he does not
want to strike out the amount of money the
crews now receive, which formerly was re-
ceived in liquor.
Mr. MAYNARD. Does not the law fix the
ration?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Certainly it
does, and we follow the estimates and follow
the law. The omission of this would not
strike out liquor at all.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. The dif-
ficulty, I find, is that while soldiers' rations
are commuted at thirty cents, and they really
cost only about twenty cents, the ration in the
revenue-cutter service is commuted at thirty-
four cents.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I suppose that
when the rates were fixed there was consid-
ered to be some good reason for the difference
in the cost of living, and wear and tear of
clothing, &c.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. That does
not add anything to the rations. That does
not go into the belly.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. The rations have
a good deal to do with the health and general
condition of those who receive them. But if
there is anything wrong in this matter it is in
the law, and not in the appropriation bill or
the estimates. Furthermore, the gentleman
from Massachusetts himself must recognize
the fact that it costs more to live on shipboard
than to live on the shore.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I with-
draw my amendment.
Mr. RANDALL. I renew it for the pur-
pose of asking the chairman of the Commit-
tee on Appropriations a question. I find that
this bill appropriates for the revenue marine
service more than a million dollars. I should
like the gentleman from Ohio to state whether
that is the entire amount of the appropriation
for keeping up this revenue-cutter service;
and if so, I should like him also to inform
the House what proportion it bears to the
