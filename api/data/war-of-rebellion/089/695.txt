HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, November 24, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,Secretary of War, Washington:

SIR: On the 19th of September last I had the honor to address a letter to you presenting the names of certain officers of this army deemed by me as pre-eminently worthy of brevet appointments for their services in the field, and in that communication I stated the list then forwarded was reduced to the lowest practicable limit, and that it was my purpose on another occasion to submit to you a more general list of recommendations. I, therefore, now transmit such a list for your consideration, comprising the recommendations that have been sent to mile by corps and other commanders, in compliance with my instructions requiring them to present the names of such officers of their respective commands as had, in their judgment, won by their services the reward of a brevet appointment, and the names of certain officers on duty at my headquarters. Where officers have been recommended for brevets for services rendered prior to August 1, 1864. I would respectfully advise that if the appointments asked for be conferred they be given the date of August 1.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
