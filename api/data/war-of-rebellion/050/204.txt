Upsham says Bragg had no intention to flank or outwit Rosecrans, but simply to crush his army, and that the result is felt to be failure. General Gilem tells me he will have the Northwestern Railroad to Reynoldsburg finished two months hence.

On the other hand, General Thomas has risen to the highest point in their esteem, as he has in that of every one who witnessed his conduct on that unfortunate and glorious day; and should there be a change in the chief command, there is no other man whose appointment would be so welcome to this army. I would earnestly recommend that in such an event his merits be considered. He is certainly an officer of the very highest qualities, soldierly and
