Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

General Owen is on the left of McKeen, and they are entrenching. I have not heard from Barlow yet. His connection on the advanced line appears not yet to be made with Birney.

Respectfully forwarded.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864. (Received 11.50 p. m.)

General BIRNEY:

GENERAL: General Wright, with the Sixth Corps, is ordered to proceed to-night to Cold Harbor. The major-general commanding desires you to withdraw across the creek to-night, taking up the position you held this morning, leaving your skirmishers in the position now occupied by your line of battle, and placing a brigade along the line built for the artillery near the Shelton house, and disposing the rest of your force to protect your right flank from any advance of the enemy in that direction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864 - 3.40 a. m.

General WILLIAMS:

There has been considerable skirmishing going on last night and this morning where the dead and wounded lie, so that I have been unable to withdraw the Pennsylvania Reserves till after daylight. I am afraid I cannot do it til after daylight to-day. They probably would not like to go until all their dead and wounded had been cared for.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1864 - 6.30 a. m.

Major-General WARREN:

I am directed to say that the portion of the Pennsylvania Reserves to be discharged will not probably be required to report at the supply train to-day. I will let you know when they should report to General Ingalls.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
