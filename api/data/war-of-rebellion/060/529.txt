Brigadier- General KELLEY,

Cumberland:

Major Foley has just returned from Winchesters. The forces that were in Winchester yesterday consisted of 160 men of Imboden's command, who had come all the way from Mount Jackson for the purpose of capturing some officers that they expected were to be at the wedding of Miss Ginn. He reports that the entire country in that direction is open. It is rumored, the major says, amongst the enemy that there is a large force collecting at Martinsburg to move down the valley soon.
