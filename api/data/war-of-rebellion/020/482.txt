Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA,Charleston, April 23, 1862.

Major T. A. WASHINGTON, Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: I have the honor to report that in consequence of the removal of so large a part of the infantry force from this department to other points I have deemed it necessary to withdraw all troops except the cavalry between the Ashepoo and Oketie, and to locate them solely with reference to the defense of the cities of Charleston and Savannah. This will leave the line of the Charleston and Savannah Railroad with no other protection than what the cavalry companies can afford, which is altogether insufficient. Raids of the enemy may consequently be expected, and perhaps the direct communication between the two cities be cut off. The railroad connection through Augusta is delayed only by the want of iron; if it cannot be procured otherwise I shall have to impress it. This I have made arrangements to do, if necessary. The removal of eight regiments from the department leaves a surplus of transportation, as wagons and mules, &amp;c., if needed, some of them might follow the regiments, though if it is intended to re-enforce this command they will be required here.

I inclose a report of the strength of Brigadier-General Ripley's division on April 12. It will be perceived that after deducting Colonel Marshall's regiment the whole force for duty is considerably less than 5,000.

I have the honor to report that for the present I shall establish my headquarters in Charleston.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
