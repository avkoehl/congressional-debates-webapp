Brigadier Gen R. B. MARCY,

Chief of General McClellan's Staff:

Have crossed the Monocacy at its mouth. Hear nothing of the rebels.

Have sent out scouts in the direction of Barnesville, Poolesville, and at the lower fords. My command is pretty well used up, having marched over 70 miles in the last twenty-four hours. If Stuart takes back track, shall not be able to follow him, but will do all I can. The Sixth Cavalry has not reported to me.

Have just heard that the rebels passed down through a small town called Middletown, 5 or 6 miles east of this, about one hour ago, so they said. They were traveling at a trot, and were evidently making for the Potomac, to cross. I shall start at once for Frederick, and expect to hear from then at that point. They are making for other Noland's or Hauling's Crossing, at the mouth of the Monocacy.
