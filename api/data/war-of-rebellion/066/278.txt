COLONEL: I have the honor to inform you that the brigadier-general commanding has given his consent that blankets be issued to the destitute rebel officers, prisoners of war. You are authorized to make demand upon the post quartermaster for them, the blankets to be turned over to the quartermaster by the provost-marshal when the prisoners are removed from the island.

I am, colonel, with great respect, your obedient servant,

Rear-Admiral DAHLGREN,

Commanding South Atlantic Blockading Squadron:

SIR: I have the honor to report that the firing from this ship last night was occasioned by trying to bring a sloop to, in the act of violating the quarantine regulations of this port. He paid no attention to us until I fired the second shot; he then lowered his sail. I then dispatched the Larkspur (sent here to condense water for the ship) to bring her under our guns, but in the darkness she escaped. The larkspur searched for her nearly an hour. She is not in sight this morning. I also report that Acting Master E. G. Furber is still sick and unable to attend to duty.

Very respectfully,

GEORGE R. BAILEY,

Acting Ensign, U. S. N., Executive Officer.

Major General J. G. FOSTER, U. S. Volunteers,

Commanding Department of the South, Hilton Head:

GENERAL: In reply to your letter of the 5th instant in regard to James Pike and Charles R. Gray, I have to say that they were arrested in Edgefield District of this State. They were not in U. S. uniform when captured, and but about their persons certain papers which warranted the belief that they were spies. They are confined, as is usual in such cases, and will be accorded a fair trial.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General, Commanding.
