known we could decide, but active rebel operations are going on. Either they will soon meet us up here or they will be whipped back south of the Arkansas.

LITTLE ROCK, September 10, 1864.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

General Price has crossed the Arkansas at Dardanelle with a large cavalry force, variously estimated from 5,000 to 10,000. He has a large train and a pontoon bridge. It was my opinion that he intended to join Shelby, who has about 5,000 armed, and operate on my communications, while Magruder pushed in front with his infantry. But Price's soldiers all say they are going to Missouri, and almost everybody here thinks so. I cannot understand how they can subsist on the march to Missouri. They make a clean sweep of everything as they go. I have just received re-enforcements from Memphis, and shall do all I can to keep Price out of Missouri. If troops had reached me sooner I could easily have defeated Price's Missouri movements, if such are his plans. I have not cavalry enough to cope with him, and it is very doubtful if infantry can catch him. I have sent out three cavalry expeditions against Shelby, and he has evaded them all. General Canby wrote me that he could send troops from Morganza. I have recommended that they be sent to Missouri. If Price should go there we might make it very difficult for him to escape.
