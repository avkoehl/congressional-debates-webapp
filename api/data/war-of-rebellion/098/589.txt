Captain H. M. Whittlesey, acting chief quartermaster, report the number of animals and quartermaster's supplies taken from the country as follows:

Horses. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 858

Mules. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 1,252

Corn. . . . . . . . . . . . . . pounds. . . . . . . . 2,588,902

Hay. . . . . . . . . . . . . do. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 10,500

Fodder. . . . . . . . . . do. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 2,219,001

This estimate embraces only what has been taken up and reported to him. Of the hundreds of animals which have been taken from the country to supply [the places of] the broken-down animals in the wagon and pack trains, and those not reported at the date of his estimate, only an approximate account can be made. Nearly 700 of these animals have been killed. It wound be a low estimate, therefore, to state that at least 2,000 horses and 3,000 mules were taken from the country during the campaign, and that the quartermaster's statement of forage taken should be at least doubled.

Lieutenant Colonel G. W. Bulloch, chief commissary, makes the following estimate of commissary supplies taken from the country:

Ham. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . pounds. . . . . . . . . 100,000

Corn meal. . . . . . . . . . do. . . . . . . . . . . . 720,000

Fresh beef. . . . . . . . . do. . . . . . . . . . . . 706,250

Bacon and pork. . . . . do. . . . . . . . . . . . 650,000

Salt. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . do. . . . . . . . . . . . . . 30,750

Miscellaneous stores taken and issued as reported by brigade commissaries:

Sirup. . . . . . . . . . . . . gallons. . . . . . . . . . . . 4,000

Whisky. . . . . . . . . . . . . do. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 96

Sweet potatoes. . . . . . . . bushels. . . . . . . . . 3,200

Honey. . . . . . . . . pounds. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 500

These items cover but a faction of what was taken and used by the men. Large quantities of sirup and sugar, it is known, were daily taken and used without reporting. No reasonable estimate can be made of the seep, pigs, poultry, honey, and like articles of farms taken by foragers.

There were taken and reported:

Cattle. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 4,433
