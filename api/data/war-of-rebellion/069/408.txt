HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,May 31, 1864-8 p. m. (Received 9.30 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Since writing you General Potter has succeeded in throwing his force across what seemed to be an almost impassable ravine in his front, and is now entrenching his line. I think we will be able early to-morrow to take some open ground in front, which will give us fine positions for artillery. We are entirely in advance of the road which Major Duane telegraphed to Major Morton about; it comes into Shady Grove road, in rear of our line and makes a passage for troops and trains between ago our pickets reported sounds which indicated the passage of troops along the Mechanicsville road toward our left. The reports were indefinite, but we may hear something more reliable soon; if so, I will inform you.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

The Twenty-ninth Massachusetts Volunteers, one of the veteran regiments of the Ninth Corps, is now with General Lockwood in the Fifth Corps. It would seem proper that it should go in its own corps, and I respectfully request that it may be ordered to do so.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
