CITY POINT, VA., August 13, 1864-1 p.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Are there any recruits going from the Western States to Sherman? I have sent a regiment, 1,000 strong, a very excellent regiment, but composed entirely of deserters and prisoners from the rebel army, to General Pope. The regiment must now be in New York on its way. All the troops that Pope can relieve by this increase I want sent to Sherman. Have inspectors and surgeons gone to the Western hospitals to clear them out and send the convalescents to the front?

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 13, 1864.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I presume the regiment asked for by General Augur was the Second New York, Colonel Whistler. Board are sent to examine hospitals as fast as we can get surgeons. In the meantime inspections are being made by local surgeons. The extreme heat has had a very bad effect upon the sick in hospitals. All troops under General Pope not actually in the Indian campaign were ordered to General Sherman, and special inspection made of his department. A new demand for troops to-day from Indiana, and fears expressed of an attempt to release prisoners of war.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

I found the extreme cavalry outposts one mile and a half from town, and the troops at Baton Rouge, consisting of two regiments of infantry, two batteries, and over 3,000 cavalry, camped within this small semicircle. The outpost duty is done with great negligence. I suggested to Major-General Herron, just arrived, in command, that the division of cavalry, apart from other operations intended for it, should be thrown out on the Amite River. This would give a short line from the Manchac Bayou to the lake, and cover all the plantations in rear on
