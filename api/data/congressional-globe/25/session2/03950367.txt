CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

should have been glad to have got their note1?, as 1
they purported to pay specie for them.    The gen-
tleman  from Massachusetts opposite htm, [Mr.
Davis,] yesterday, in speaking of the assumption
hy this bank that it paid ¡specie, without indeed
calling it a case of "bamboozlement," admitted that
it was a case of "humbuggery."   Yes, sir, it is the
worst species of humbuggery.  He took his ground
yesterday, and stated that he preferred the bank
which  paid   out   its own notes,  though   it did I
not   pay    specie,   to   a   bank   which   purported I
to pay  specie^ while   u   had   no   notes   m  cir- I
eulation,   and  paid  out   the irredeemab'e   notes
of other banks.      He preferred  the bank which '
did not become the   conductor   of  the  notes ot i
odiéis, by which he knew that ho could sue them if
they did not meet their responsibilities.    He hoped
he should hear no mere remarks on this subject.
Several gentlemen had represented him as not be-
ing consented wi<h the barks which did not redeem
their notes, and at the same   time dissatisfied with
those    that    did   pay       He   hoped    gen'lemen
would not continue to represent him in this point
of view      He wished all who read what was said
here, to understand him as alluding to banks which
represented  themselves as   specie pajing banks,
v, hue they did not and could not pay specie, be-
cause they had taken care to have no notes out.
The Senator from New Jeisey, m alluding to the
testimony cited by the Senator from Connecticut,
[Mr. NilesJ meets it by geneial encomiums on
the conduct of these banks at an anterior period
What became of these general encomiums when
there were specific charges of misconduct that had
been admitted'* Theie was the sworn testimony of
the directors of these banks themselves, m which
these chatges were substantiated Every gentleman
knew what the law was inicíeteme to persons
who, havng seciet knowledge nuccessible lo the
lest oí the toTimumly, went out ami made pin-
chases at a piotlt. Hete were bank directors by
whose resohes the bank stops, and by whose ic-
solves the bank lesumes again, they had the gome
in their own hands, they depress by suspension of
pa) ment the value oí the notes and stock, and then
buy it up, and having bought it, resume payment
and raise it again And here, he would observe, they
put ihemselves m the situation of those who, hav-
ing secret knowledge not possessed by the cwmmii-
mty at large, went out and made then purchases at
a large profit, and in which there was no court ot
equity that would not set aside the sales Now, he
sa d, they were called on not only to sanction the
pinchases thus made, but to reward them Take,
for example, the testimony of one ot these duec-
tors—William Jewell, director of the Fatmeis and
Mechanics'Bank of Georgetown, sworn to by him-
self. He says "The bank failed during ray ab-
sence in Baltimore, and on my return 1 told Mr
William W Core oran that I wished to purchase
its stock," &c [The testimony went on to siy
that Mr. d rcoran informed him of a widow 1 idy
who had $15,000 worth of stock, and that he pur-
chased it through M¡. Corootan's agency, giving
her Georgetown property lor it assessed at ¿8,00(1 ]
Here, sa. 1 Mr. B vv<>s the duet tor'-- own stciv,
and sworn to by him Let the widow, said Mr B
go be/ore any oourtol equity, and carry nothing but
this pitce ot papei, and the judgi will -et pside the
sale, because tie puich su not only had secret
knowledge of the value of this st >ck, unknown to
the s Her, but ne coul 1 iaise and depress it at his.
pleasuie M> B said he had iicvei yet seen x bank
estubl shed, but i* ca nc in advance with a lust ot
widows and orphms petitioning for its charter,
and yet, in the end, the^e widow sand mphiiis were
the fust to be fleeced Every patt ot banking was
prohtable, and none more  o than the explosion,
when the widow and the oiph-m and the liboier
hecame the prey of the more s larp sighted specula-
tor He, Mr B ivas astonished at the efforts made
on that floor to crush the evidence made by the
directors of these banks themselves, ami to coun-
teract i' by general evidence in their favor, mide
at an anterior period. The Senator fiom Con-
necticut said that there was evidence here to show
that th se banks, during the time of suspension and
depreciation of their nates, put out more notes to
be shaved back again into bank, and here, said
Mr. B. is the oath of a director to prove it, sup-
ported by the resolve of the bank, under which the
issue was authorised Here was apiece of con-
duct on a par with that by which the widow's stock
was taken from her at halt its value, and, if he
were the chancellor that the case came before, the
widow should have her property back again m as
short a time as it would take to make a decree
The sworn testimony of Mr. Todd, one of the di-
rectors, showed that, at the time his bank stopped,
its notes were put out by a resolve of the bank to
be shaved back again
[Mr. B here read the testimony.]
Thus it would be seen that one of these banks,
the very da} after it stopped, agreed to gives its
notes to its depositors, and the notes being thus
given out, were pui chased up by Mr Pi out, a
broker
[Mr B then lead the testimony of Mr Prout,
showing the prices at which he bought stock and
notes, viz 50 and 75 cents in the dollar, and that he
purchased notes to the amount of $80,000, winch
he sold again at i small profit ]
Su, said Mi. B I wa  hei e at the time, and know
how these notes were depreciated, and how the
holders had to samfice them, how they weie got
out of the hands of the timid, the helpless, and the
ignorant, at half their value. Mr Prout said that
he made frequent sales of the notes he purchased
to the directors of these banks, by w hose resolves
they had become depreciated, among whom were
William A Biadley, president oí the Patriotic
Bank, a-nd Raphael Semmes, a dircctut of the
I armes' ami Mechanics' Bank of Georgetown
To 'ome ol thest gentlemen ho sold such notes, and
took in piynient ibeir promissoiy notes, at long
dates He further said ihitMi Cluneut Smitn,

Tne immednte (¡ncs inn before the Senate was
as to the mere i e ot ihe ripnal of these baldes
He caicd little about it. There was airead} mote
capital here—moonshine—than could be used
Read the report of the committee of the House of
Representatives, and you will find, Mr B said,
dm the tapit il ol ihese banks has literally rotted
don n, and you are now asked to incie ise it
it was a case in which a cap tal of a million
mere or less nude no difference It was in a Dis-
luct which had neither commerce, manufactures,
ntr aguculture, and ill which the Federal Go\etn-
ment poured out its money as biuntiful'y as the
ram fiom heaven, and, therefore, there was no
nee I for a banking capital. The charter provided
that for every dollar of specie paid m, ths banks
may issue four dollars of circulation, therefore,
they might issue eight millions under their present
capitals, and yet gentlemen wanted to give them
the power to issue more. Mr. B here entered into
a calculation to show the quantity of circulation
estimated by waters on political economy to be
necessary for a given population, and to show that
the present capitals of the banks were much too
large for the wants of a population of the size of
that of this District
There was no possible way, he said, m which
they could profitably employ or consume the
amount of these capitals If I lend my money,
said he, I am to get six pel cent lawful mteiest for
it, but these banks, for every silver dollar they
have, may lend out four, and thus draw twenty-
lour per < ent interest, and yet it is said that it is
not enough I now, said Mi B take the position
of which I spoke some time ago, and that is, to
maintain that the banking system of the United
States is the most unsoi d and the most delusive m
the world, and that nowhere m the United States is
it more unsolid and more delusive than in this Dis-
trict He meant to offer some amendments to this
bill to make it a little safer lor the community, and
he would bring them lorward at ihe proper time
For the present, he merely lose for the purpose of
illuminating the Senator from New Jeisey [Mr.
SolihardJ as to the meaning of the word ' bam-
boozle," and to help out his friend from Connecti-
cut, [Mr ISiLts,] who, by the way, seldom needed
helping out, by explaining that the testimon) which
he read was the sworn testimony ot these bank
dncctors themselves, and not to be invalidated by
general testimony given long before
Mr WILLIAMS a ad that, having been upon
the committee whicn leporled the bill under consi-
deiation, he felt it due to himself to say th it he was
