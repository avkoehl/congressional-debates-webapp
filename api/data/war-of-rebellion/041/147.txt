line, he will see how few men I have to guard a long and important front. Every day that I pass along it, my apprehensions are greatly increased.

I am, respectfully,

W. N. R. BEALL,

Brigadier-General.

Lieutenant J. S. LANIER, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. BEALL'S Brigadier, Jackson Road, June 14, 1863.

GENERAL: The men have repulsed several charges on this line. The First Mississippi is scarce of caps; can you send me any? I am trying to get them from the regiments on the right. Our loss thus far small; that of the enemy large. Most of our guns (artillery) are disabled on this line. Fire of artillery from enemy very severe.

Respectfully,W. N. R. BEALL,

Brigadier-General.

[Major-General GARDNER.]
HDQRS. BEALL'S Brigadier, Port Hudson, La., June 14, 1863.

MAJOR: The loss of the First Mississippi Regiment in to-day's engagement is very severe-18 killed and about 14 wounded. The command is much reduced. Cannot the 100 men ordered to Colonel [B. W.] Johnson for duty be returned to the regiment?

Very respectfully,W. N. R. BEALL,

Brigadier-General.

Major T. F. WILLSON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Third Military District.
