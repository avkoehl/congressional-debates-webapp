The conduct of Couriers Owings, Lee, Nightingale, and Henry Shackelford deserves the highest praise.

The enemy's loss was heavy. Besides leaving a number of his dead and wounded on the field,he carried off a large number on horses and in ambulances. We captured 29 prisoners-1 captain, 2 lieutenants, and 26 privates. My own loss was 11 killed, 88 wounded, and 34 taken prisoners, making an aggregate of 133. In horses, 71 killed, 87 wounded, 12 captured,making aggregate loss of horses 170.

Among the killed I deeply regret to report Major [J. W.] Puller, of the Fifth, and Lieutenant [C. S.] Harris, of the Fourth, both gallant and highly efficient officers-a heavy loss to their regiments and country.

In conclusion, I desire especially to state that Major General J. E. B. Stuart joined me before the fight commenced; was on the field the whole day; assisted immensely by his sagacious counsels, large experience, and by his usual daring and conspicuous example in turning the fortunes of the day in our favor. We share with him the anguish and deep grief felt at the loss of the noble Pelham, of his staff, an officer of the brightest promise for the future.

Major [Lewis F.] Terrell, of General Stuart's staff, beside being active on the field assisted the gallant [Captain James] Breathed in the management of the artillery. Captain [Harry W.] Gilmor, Twelfth Virginia Cavalry, a volunteer for the occasion on the major-general's staff, I also commend for his marked bravery and cool courage. I append a recapitulation of my loss.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ. LEE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General R. H. CHILTON,

Asst. Adjt. and Insp. General, Army of Northern Virginia.

SIR: I find in looking over a retained copy I have of the fight near Kelly's Ford, the latter portion of one of the sentences reads, "and a long, high stone fence, running perpendicular to my advance." Be kind
