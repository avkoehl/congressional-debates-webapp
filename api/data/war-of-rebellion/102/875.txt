HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF THE PLAINS,Julesburg, Colo. Ter., June 13, 1865.

Honorable A. S. PADDOCK,

Acting Governor Territory of Nebraska, Omaha, Nebr. Ter.:

DEAR SIR: I am in receipt of a note from A. S. porter, of Dakota, Nebr. Ter., and indorsed by yourself, which refers to the unprotected state of certain counties in Your Territory. I regret exceedingly that necessity compelled me to withdraw the troops from Dakota, Columbus, and Omaha. As You must be aware, I have a large district, a long line of road to protect, and comparatively but few troops to do it. Furthermore, it was represented to me that no necessity existed for the presence of troops at those points; and knowing that an imperative necessity existed for their presence farther west, and that the public good would be subserved thereby, I withdrew them. I have already taken steps for the protection of Columbus and neighboring settlements, and You may assure the people of Dakota that as soon as re-enforcements now en route reach me they shall have all necessary protection. I have authorized Colonel Livingston to grant the leave of absence asked for by the band of the First Nebraska Cavalry.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

P. EDW. CONNOR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
