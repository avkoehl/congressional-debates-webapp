receipt of papers connected with the Vicksburg capture before going to City Point.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. H. LUDLOW,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Agent for Exchange of Prisoners.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, July 22, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I respectfully call to your attention the case of Mayor Monroe, of New Orleans. He has now been in prison for more than fourteen months. He was placed there for his remonstrance against General Butler's order in reference to the ladies of New Orleans. Is not an imprisonment for fourteen months a sufficient punishment for such an offense?

His family is in a most wretched and poverty-stricken condition, sufficiently so, certainly, to excite the sympathy of even an enemy. Will you not make diligent inquiry into his case and use every endeavor to secure his release and his return to his family?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, July 22, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I call your special attention to the inclosed list of persons* captured in Louisiana in May last. They have all been sent to the prison at Alton, Ill.

Is it the purpose of your Government to keep these persons in confinement. If so, how long and for what reason?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, July 22, 1863.

Captain JOHN E. MULFORD:

SIR: We have several thousands of your prisoners still in Richmond ready for delivery. Mrs. Sawyer and Mr. W. Whilden cannot be permitted to land at City Point. I am sorry they have been put to the trouble of coming. I have certainly at no time hinted that they would be permitted to land. If any person has stated to them that they could, it has been done without proper authority. In view of the course which has been pursued by the U. S. authorities in reference to communication between the Confederate States and the United States, I do not see how any person could suppose that Mrs. Sawyer and her relative would be allowed to come to Richmond. With reference to Messrs. Stewart and McKenzie, I have given to Captain Hatch the proper instructions.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
