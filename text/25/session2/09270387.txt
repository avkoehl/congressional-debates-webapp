tions out of ihe present controversy.   It would be a
contest comparatively about nothing
In conclusion, I scarcely know what disposition
the Senate ought to make of this bill. It would not
be treating a sovereign State with proper respect
to vote against its introduction After it shall have
been received, should it be referred to the Commit-
tee of Foreign Relations, as one member of that
committee, I shall be in favor of letting it sleep
there, or of reporting it back to the Senate, with a
recommendation that it be indefinitely postponed
NORTHEASTERN BOUNDARY
REMARKS OF MR. HOWARD,
Of Maryland.
In the Howe of Representatives, May 29, 1838—
On the proposition or Mr. Evans, to refer so
much o( the Message of the President on ihe sub*
ject of the Northeastern Boundary, as related to
the remuneration of certain individuals to the
Committee on Foreign Affair*, and that the re-
sidue thereof be, for Ihe present, laid on the table.
Mr HOWARD (chairman of ti  Committee
on Foreign Affans) said that this debate, like one
v hich had occurred a short time ago upon the sub-
ject of ihe territory to the westward of ihe Rocky
Mouttairs, contemplated no vo'e by the House
upon any controverted po nt, and was, therefole,
important only as far as the expression of opinion
by members of the House might bréate an influ-
ence upon the public mird In the comse of the
debate, somethings had been said w hich seemed
to him to require such comments as he might be
enabled to make from hi' general recollection,
for, being entirely ignorant until that morning of
tne reasons, which induced the gentleman from
Maine [Mr Evans] to make the motion which he
had made, or of the train of argument which he
meant to pursue m support of that motion, he was
obliged to throw h'mseif upon his remembrance of
the multitudinous documents relating to the North-
eastern Boundary, without having an opportunity
of inspecting them minutely. Whilst the gentle-
men who had preceded him were addressing the
House, he had refeired to some of these papers,
and felt a sufficient justification for ¡he dissent
which he intended to express from some of the opi-
nions advanced by those gentlemen. The motion
was twofold to reter that portion of the Message
v. hich related to the claims of certain persons for
compensation to the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
and to lay upon the table the residue of the Mes-
sage. Upon each of these points he proposed to
sty a few words
The Gov ernor of Mama had addressed a letter tu
the President of the United States, enclosing seve-
ral resolves of the Legislature of that State, and
claiming lennbursement trom the General Govern-
ment, of certain moneys paid to Ebenezer S Gree-
lv, John Baker, and others, in compensation for
losses and sufferings experienced by them respec-
tively, which letter had been transmitted by the
President to the House of Representatives, and it
was now proposed to refer it to the Committeeon Fo-
reign Affairs To this reference he had not the
slightest objection On the contrary, it would give
him, índrvidua'lv, and, he «as sure, the committee,
c illactnelj, great p'easu'e to re-examine the sub-
ject, and leview the opinion which they had ex-
pressed m a report at the last session of Congress
The draanl now made by the Governor m the
same form ?s before, which did not recei.e the
sanction of th committee, and it~ repetition, under
circumstances which mamfes'e ' an entire disregard
of the principle which had gcverned the committee
m coining to the conclusion which they reached, must
be co istiued into an implied but strong censure of
that report, and he (Mr H ) felt himself called
i.pon to vind cate it He did not know whethei
the persons for whom compensation was now asked
were, or were not, the same whose cases had been
the subject of that report, as, in 1837, one of them
is called John Harford, and, in 1838, John Har-
forl, jr, and the name of Phineas R Harford,
w hich was belore the committee last year, nowhere
appeals in the doeumen s now before fie House
But, the principle is  the sime upon whrh all the
claims rest, as will be evident from a comparison
of the report of 1837 with the papers now before us
On the first of February, 1837, the President, by
message, communicated to the House of Represen-
tatives a letter from the Governor of the State of
Maine, with sundry resolutions of the Legislature
of that State, stating that there had been paid from
the S'ate Treasury to John and Phineas R Har-
ford the sum of one hundred dollars each, as a
compensation for losses and expenses incurred by
them in 1831, and claiming to be reimbursed from
the Treasury of the United Stales On the 22d of
February, 1837, the Committee on Foreign Af-
fairs made a report, from which the following is
an extract
' The uncertainty of the principle upon which the cía m
rests show? the propriety of having this, like every other case
nvjh ing an expenditure from the National Tteasury, aiibtrm
ted to an examination by a committee of Conies'), jpon n   i
reotclaun by the individuals interested    Where aíslatele
gislature interposes its decision, and asks that the money   aid
by H should be refunded, a committee of the House is placed m
the embarrassing condition of reviewing the facts and prmci
pl^s alleged to be settled by the voeofthe L°ffi luure   or ot
sanctioning the inadmisible pretension, that the opinion of
any me State is a sufficient warrant for a ch r"e upon the
Federal Treasury    There are ca es where an expenditure by
a State shoul 1 be promptly and liberally refjnded, euch, for
example as tho - in which she steps fuiwa^d to defend heraelf
noma sudden mvnson by an enen y   or to waid off" dans'1!
fiom any quaiter    Taking upon herseli the performance of a
duly winch he Con* ltution has devolved upon theTjnion it l 
liiehly proper thn' the Union shoul 1 acknowledge the service
but even m these cases the practice of the Government has
been to subject the claim to a rigorous scrutiny b\ the officers
of the Federal Government
It might be [Mr Howard continued] that these
principles were unsound, and the Governor of
Maine appeared to think so, because, in his letter
to the Piesident, after asking reimbursement by the
Government of the United States of the several
sums pa'd out of the Treasurj tf the State, he
savs
rThe pi tice and pro} ríe y ot grant ng this request I can
have no doubt wi 1 b° apparent to you and to Congress when
the circumstances undei wh eh ihe allowances wer^ made are
called to mind
It appeared somewhat extraordinary that the
Governor of Maine ohould repeat hib demand upon
the President, without taking the slightest notiee of
the fate of a preceding demand, or thinking the
doctrines la d down by the committee worthy of a
passing comment So far from being shaken m his
belief of their correctness, he [Mr H ] himself was
confirmed in his opinion of their soundness, and their
conformity with tbe settled prtct ce of thp Housp
although he was perfectly 'tiíhng, as ne had «aid
before, to have them strictly and dispassionately
reviewed by the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
now composed, in part, of diffeient persons from
those who constituted it when the report was made
He begged leave to test them by their application
to the case before the House On th" 12ih of
March, 1838, the Legislature of Mame passed the
following resolutions
"Resolved That theie be allowed and paid out of the Tret
sur} of this Sta e to Ebenezer S Gre<. v foe hundred dillars,
which sum is m fu'i for all sufViin°' an 1 h sses attendant upon
his arret and imprisonment in iht jail ?t Frekenekton N B
m consequeice of taking tne census ot Madawaska
' Resolved That the Governoi of this tetate be requested to
ask and receive fiom the Go\einmeit of the T nited *ta es a
reimbursement o the &um hereby allowed to the said Gieelj
afte the same --hall have been paid to him out of the Tiea tin
of this State
On the 19th of March the Legislature passed le-
solutions similar to theaboie, allowing to John
Bakei, Walter Posers, Nathaniel Bartlett, Augus-
tine Webster, Isaac Yea-mgton, and John Har-
ford, jr various sums of money in fu'l eomp°nka-
tion for all sufferings and losses in consequence of
organizing the tow n of Madawaska
Before any compon sail-m for losses otight to be
taken out of the Federal Treasury, it became those
who were the only constituí onal guardians of the
public money, viz the Government of the United
States, in all its branches, to see that the it sses
were of such a nature as to furnish a proper claim
upon that Government, and that the compensation
allowed was of a proper amount Bui if a State
undertakes to decide both these questions, and
leaves to Congress nothing but Ihe subordinate
duty of providing an appropriation of the amount
which another tribunal has deiermmed to he the
just debt, wheie is the svuntv for the public mo-
ney, which is the property of all the people of the
Untied States?   What is the right of one  State
must be equally the right of all; and we should
have in existence twenty-six keys to the National
Treasury, the possessor of each of which could
enter at his or their pleasure Again- the remune-
ration provided by Maine, is, m part, for sufferings
sustained What were these sttfferingsl How
much will compensate them? These are questions
to be answered only by a committee of the House
of Representatives, or some officer of the Federal
Government, if Congress choose to vest him with
t íe power, but by no means to be liquidated by any
State Government, whose opinion i¡ to be held as
final Th s is the practice of the Government, and
has been so as long back as he had been able to
trace it.
After the late war with Great Br tain, large
claims were presented by many of the States for
money advanced under an urgent necessity to re-
sist actual invasion by the enemy, and amongst
these States was the one which he had trie honor m
part to represent Maryland was obliged, fiom
her geographical position, to call out her militia
almost continually, and so promptly that there was
m time to appiy to the Federal Goierrmen , th 
consequence of which vas fhi , when the war was
terminated, sne had expended a!1 'hat constitu ed
her capital In obtaining tbe reirrtu errent, to
which every principle of honor, gratitude, or po-
licy entitbd ner, at the hands of the Federal
Government, she was neverthe'ess obliged (o pa s
her accounts through the ordeal of an Auditor s
office, where none were admitted unless they vvcie
in conf' rmity with the acts of Cong-es , and prac-
tice of the Executive Depaitaserts, and he believed
that, up to this day, she was la ge'y a end ' r of
the United States for bums whioh sh„ had sprpt In
tl>3 defenc  of the comtrv, w thout stopping to
look always at the receip s tu ve whe her or not
thev were in proper form to pass tn* Audiloi's in-
spection A gentleman of talents and industry,
atierw ards a member of ibis Hous" had * ecn ap-
pointed an agent on behalf of the Sta'e, and he had
bestowed upon his duty that care, zeal and aHVj,
which might have been expected from bis w Jl  sta>-
lished character, but, still, «peaking from general re-
collection, Mr H thought there were !ar<re sums ex
pended by the State in the desjltor} mi1 tia " ar°are
which she was obliged to carry on, for which no
sufficient vouchers ever could be obtained, and 'rev
w cio, consequently, los' Buhf ihe doctrine which
is new contended for by the Governor of Maine be
correct, it would only have been necessary for Ma-
ryland to assert that she had incurred these ex-
penses, which ought properly to have been borne by
the Federal Government, and from her decision
there would hav e been no appeal Cas s m ghf he
cited, even at lue preseni Corgress, where ihe
c'aims of a Sta*e for militia services m repressing
Indian hostilities are passed upon b\ a committee
of the House of Representative, bat it was not ne-
cessary to go further into the exammat on of this
point In all this, he did not mean to b° under-
stood as expressing any op mon as to the men s of
the claims whichnthesufleier^ in Maine might have
upon the Federal Government fhej might be
perfecilv just, and, if so, he would be amongst ¡he
first to re mbuiae them cheerfully All he meant
to contend for was, that he might be allow fd to
make up an opinion tor himself upon the evi lence
in the case and not be bound down by the opn on
even of 'he Legisla ure of a Sta'e, w h'ch althougr.
ent ¡led to greet w e gl t and respect, ought not to 1
cons dtrel obligator But he s shed >gam to sa}
that he should make no opposition o th" re<eie ic
of thi' puit of tbe rifssaa' of the Prfs ^e to the
Committee on Foreign Affairs

connected with it had grown toagieatbuik The
