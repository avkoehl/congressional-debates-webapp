General LAWLER,

Morganza:

Send General McGinnis with 3,000 infantry, 1,000 or 2,000 cavalry, and one battery,to drive off a rebel force and battery near Bayou Sara. Let the force land at Bayou Sara under the cover of the gun-boats and act from there as circumstances require. If your information warrants it vary the above force to suit the case. It is supposed General Dennis and force have returned and that you have transportation sufficient.

Major General F. STEELE:

The Nevada left Saint Charles since the Sally List, and what I can learn indicates that Colonel Moore is not doing a thing toward moving. I suggested last evening that the Celeste be sent down to bring them up. The Nevada, now here, might go down. She is not, however, yet unloaded. The Tycoon is at Saint Charles waiting.

Captain C. H. DYER,

Little Rock:

I am afraid much valuable time is being lost. If we fail in this enterprise after Shelby will not the effect the extremely damaging? If Colonel Moore is to come up he should come promptly. I don't know what business he had to send up the Kate Hard to represent the obstacles. I thought the Celeste should have been started down last night to hurry him up.
