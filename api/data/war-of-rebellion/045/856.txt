Sentinels who rest their muskets upon the ground, do not walk

their posts, and talk with any one that will listen to them, may be

Soldiers will not do their duty unless their officers require it

be held responsible for it. The heavy labor of the trenches is nearly over, and let us one and all unite, and gain for the command a reputation for cleanliness, order, and discipline that all will

refer to with pride and satisfaction.
