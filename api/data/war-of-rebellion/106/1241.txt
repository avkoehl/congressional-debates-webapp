This is said to be about sixty miles southwest of the Umatilla Reservation. The Snakes captured forty-eight horses from the firnedly Indians and drove them back to the reserves. I will go down to the reserve to-day and see if my information has been exaggerated.

If upon an investigation at the reservation I find there is a probability of doing anything, I shall order Captain Waters and his detachment inot the field, taking command in person.
