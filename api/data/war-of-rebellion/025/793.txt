the raft. I also ordered the construction of such rough log houses as may be necessary, convenient to the command, for stage of heavy articles, such as sugar, bacon, rice, and molasses, and have secured the use of such houses on the place of Mr. Ben. Roach as are necessary for storage of such articles as will be better to have kept there. I also made arrangements with him to grind corn and furnish a sufficient amount of meal for all the troops. He also agrees to furnish pasturage for 150 to 200 head of beeves. He will act as a Government agent under the post commissary to assist in purchasing and storing such supplies as can be had near and above the Yazoo forces, and thus avoid the necessary for transporting them by land from this place.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. B. REED,

Major and Commissary of Subsistence.

General T. H. HOLMES,

Your second dispatch of 8th received. Your were telegraphed yesterday, in answer to your dispatch of 5th, in which you were told you must exercise your judgment in the matter; that it is impossible at this distance to judge of your necessities, but that if you could give aid it was hoped you would do so.
