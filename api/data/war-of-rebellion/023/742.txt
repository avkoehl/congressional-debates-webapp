KNOXVILLE, TENN., August 1, 1862.

Major-General LORING,

Commanding Department Western Virginia:

GENERAL: A movement in co-operation with General Bragg is contemplated into Middle Tennessee. The great obstacle to the expedition is the want of transportation. Can you not send me some from your department? If so, --- ---, the bearer of this communication, will give you receipts for all you can spare. The animals should be pushed forward by the most expeditious route as rapidly as possible, while the wagons and harness can be sent by rail to Knoxville.

Your obedient servant,

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.
