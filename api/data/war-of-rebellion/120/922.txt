ROBERT OULD, Esq., Commissioner of Exchange:

I am informed that certain prisoners of war are now employed at labor in making army material for your forces. It is so published without contradiction in two Richmond journals. If this be so, the practice must cease. This Government has never employed prisoners of war in any other work than that which contributed to their own comfort and convenience. If this fact is not either officially denied, or assurances given that it will be stopped by your authorities, I shall be compelled to employ an equal or greater number of your men, prisoners in my hands, in the manner judged by me most advantageous to my army as you have done with ours.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner of Exchange.

ROBERT OULD, Esq., Commissioner of Exchange:

SIR: Major Mulford, my assistant agent of exchange, has at Varina about 700 invalid prisoners for delivery. For obvious reasons they cannot be received by you there, and in the present state of the roads it would be cruel to transport them far by wagons. I would suggest that they be delivered at Port Walthall, at the same point where it is proposed to deliver the naval prisoners. If so, the prisoners will be delivered there at any hour you may name. We will also receive yours at the same point, or, if you prefer, we will deliver at the point on the New Market road between the pickets.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General and Commissioner of Exchange.

Colonel C. C. DWIGHT, Commissioner of Exchange, U. S. Army:

COLONEL: I have just been advised by telegraph of the arrival of the Federal prisoners at Marshall, Tex. ; they will probably reach this place to-morrow, everything being ready for their trip down the river. I shall leave Shreveport next day, and if no untoward accident prevents I shall have the honor of meeting you at our usual rendezvous at Red River Landing on the 12th or 13th instant.
