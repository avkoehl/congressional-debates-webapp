Brigadier General W. S. WALKER,

Commanding Third Military District of South Carolina:

GENERAL: The general commanding instructs me to say, in reply to your communication of the 25th ultimo, that he has directed a "reserve supply" of small-arm ammunition, limited to 20 rounds per man, to be issued to district ordnance officers. This reserve supply is in addition to the 40 rounds per man allowed by General Orders, Numbers 10, from these headquarters, current series. On account of the great scarcity of small-arm ammunition this restriction, allowing in all 60 rounds per man on the eve of an engagement, is made a matter of necessity. Balls-crews have also been directed to be issued to the different commands at once. A general order, embracing these various points, will be issued to-morrow.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,
