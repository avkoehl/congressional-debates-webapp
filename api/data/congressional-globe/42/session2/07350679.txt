that tor in ore than twenty five your* tie hud !

he was but a ts pu of his el'f-s. The work is ,
hard, frequently p-osecuu-d with the miner i
lviug on his back .is he burrows along the
\Vi.>, or F'unding tinkle-dco-p in ivi'er that
tiiekb's cold (rom figures overhead. Such
withdrawal from the light and atmosphere of
the surface, and such labor and exposure, ere
lung weaken the constitution and rack the
frame with the pangs of rheuma'ism or other
ailments; and statistics show that the dura-
tion of the life of the miner is much below the
average of other ordinary avocations.
But not only is the every-day wear upon the
system great, the miner is besides in moment-
ary danger to life and limb. When he leaves
his family in the morning there is alwajs
weighing at the heart of each the possibility he
ni'-iy not return alive. In an instant his limbs
mat be ci ushed or the narrow pathway closed
behind him by the crumbling rock or the
sliding coal.
A sad evidence of the hazards to which the
miner is exposed is found in the number of
maimed that maybe seen in a coal settlement,
and in the touching and creditable fact of the
mutual societies that commonly exist, among
them to palliate the miseries oi the crippled
ami the bereaved.
Sometimes, too. the lurking fire-damp leaps
suddenly upon him from i's hi Men lair and
quickly P'illes his breath and sniK his heart;
or—horror of horrors!—Iignts up us suipbur-
ous gases into consuming fiatae, and makes
dea'.h more hideous by adding the torments
of tiie to the agonies of suffocation.
Mr. Chairman, in behalf of these men, and
the Man land mdustry that supports them, I
repeat, let the tariffbe revised in the spirit of
fairness and equality.
For the encourag
of commerce and j| pains to ascertain this f\c on inquiry from all
ship-budding all map-risj! used in the con- || the leading industries in the district which I
struction of vessels should be absolutely free
of custom duties.
I think when the committee propose a reduc-
tion of twenty per cent, upo^i the leading man-
ufactures of the country, without regard to 'he
present. price of materials and labor or the
profits arising fiom the capital invested, they
are perpetrating great inju stice not, only to the
capitalist, but an immensely greater wrong to
the laborer.
The reduction of duty proposed on woolen
and cotton goods, on paper, thread, and many
other articles, is altogether excessive. The
profits from these manufactures since the war
have been small, and of'en the woolen mills
have been operated at a loss to the proprietors.
And the committee have made a greater re-
duction on these than on other interests which !
have realized larger profits. The result will j
be to bankrupt, the cotton and woolen man- |
ufacturers or drive them into other pursuits i
on which a less reduction has been made, and ;
have the honor to represent, and I have no
doubt that when we consider the high rate of
wages the application of this amount of
reduction will become a seriou3 embarrassment
to those interests, and will result in a transfer
of the capital and the workmen of the coun-
try to other interests, with a tendency to break
down those interests and produce bankruptcy.
I said wages are as high to day as daring
the war. This is true of the wages paid to the
laborers engaged in the manufacture of cotton
and woolen goods, prints, rubber goods,
threads, paper, and all kinds of machinery.
Wages ought not to be reduced, and in mafeiag
a tariff we must look to the interest of labor
as well as of capital, and take into consider-
ation every interest of the people.
Mr. Speaker, I think I may claim to have
voted heretofore in accordattee with this prin-
ciple, whenever the subject has been before
Congress, since I have been a member. The
West and the South are equally interested with
these industries will, as a matter of necessity, j. New England and the great central States of
The Tariff.
SPEECH OF IIOX. H. ii. STARKWEATHER,
OF eoxMsCTtcur,
In the House of Representatives.
May 4, 1872.
The House having metfor debate as in Committee
of the Whole—
Mr. STARKWEATHER said;
Mr. Speaker: We have heard from thegen-
tleinan from Massachusetts who has just taken
his sep.t [Mr. Banks] a historv of the wonder-
ful growth of manufactures in this country,
and we have been charmed by his eloquence.
I propose to state briefly my views m rela-
tion to the legislation proposed in regard to
the tariff and internal revenue laws. A larger
reduction should be made in taxation than
has been suggested by most ot the gentlemen
who have participated in this discussion.
When the war closed we had a grea1 debt
upon us. [n the course of a tew years mil-
lions of this debt have been paid—more than
three hundred millions within the last three
ytars—and now the interests of the country
demand that an annual reduction ot at least
000 00i> should be made m taxation. I
would propose, in the first place, to do away
entirely with the internal revenue taxation,
except the tax on liquors and tobacco in their
various forms, and a portion ot the stamp
lax. The income tax must be abolished,
never to be revived. Nothing but the neces-
sities arising from the war ever justified its
enactment, for it was odious, unequal in its j
operations, imposing its burdens often on |
the business rather than the wealth of the
country, and always encouraging men ot un-
conscientious minds to evade its provisions.
New York and Pennsylvania in this question.
\ The true policy is to create a diversified and
! profitable industry iti all sections of the coun-
try. The Constitution evidently authorizes a
discrimination in legislation in favor of the
: industries of the people in respect to the
: manner of raising the revenue. It reads:
} "The Congress shalihaveoowar Bj lay and collect
'' taxes, duties, imposts, and excises; to pay debs**
and provide for tiie common defense and general
lj welfare of tiie United States."
jj It is clear that the means to pay the national
debt and the eurreut exoenses of the Goveru-
be overcrowded, and in their turn suffer.
Let the reduction be less, if any is made, and
more just and uniform.
Mr. BURCHARD. Has the gentleman's
attention been called to the application of the
reductions proposed in the committee's bill?
The gentleman will observe that they are to be
anplb-d upon those rates of duty which are
exce=sivelv high. In cotton, for instance, the
specific duties have become very high on ac-
count of the reduc'ion of the price of the
article; and in woolen the reduction is only
half that which was given as an equivalent fur !| ment ought to be raised in such a manner as
internal tixation. j| to conduce and promote the "general wel-

out the statement.
Mr. STARKWEATHER. 1 have not time
now to speak in detail, but I propose to sub-
mit a statement of facts which has an import-
ant hearing on this subject. The wages ot
skilled laborers in our manfacruring and me
chanical establishments are a? high to-day as
during the war. This statement is sustained
by all the labor statistics. And I have taken
wealth; and in this increase in enterprise and
diversity of industrial pursuit now shown by
the statistics of the Census Office is a new
pledge of national progress and wealth.
The West is uo longer a merely agricultural
people, but are rapidly and successfully com-
peting with the East in new industries. The
following table shows the wonderful increase
in this respect since 1850 :
