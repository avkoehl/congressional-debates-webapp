on the Courtableau. He instructs that you send a sufficient number of men under experienced officers to break up the traffic, and instruct them to burn immediately all cotton which has been stored in the Courtableau, including Washington, or hidden near the bank of that bayou. It is certain that all such cotton has recently been taken to such points for the purpose of shipment to the enemy's lines, as the enemy removed all which was there during their occupation of the country last spring. Similar instructions to these have been given to Brigadier-General Scurry, to be carried out by his scouting parties of cavalry on the east bank of the Courtableau and the Atchafalaya.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILL M. LEVY,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

P. S.-The major-general commanding directs that you will order the officer charged with the execution of these orders to report through you to these headquarters the names of the parties to whom the cotton which may be destroyed belonged, the quantity, and all the circumstances connected therewith, such as the time it was handed to said persons, the buyer, &amp;c.

Respectfully,

WILL M. LEVY,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to state to you as follows: Instructions have been given to Colonel W. G. Vincent to send the necessary men with suitable officers to the line of the west bank of the Bayou Courtableau for the purpose of seizing and burning all cotton has been taken to these points recently, as the enemy during their occupation of that country last spring removed all the cotton in that vicinity, and is evidently intended for illegal traffic with the enemy. If such cotton as may be seized by Colonel Vincent can be used by you for the purpose of exchange which you have been heretofore authorized to make, you will instruct Ed. [colonel] Vincent to take possession of it, and instead of destroying it you will use it if available.

Colonel Vincent will be notified of the contents of this communication from these headquarters also, as well as from your division.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WILL M. LEVY,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.
