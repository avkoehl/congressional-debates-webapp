Mr. BAYARD. I would ask the honorable
Senator from Maine whether he thinks he has
full authority for deeming a larceny not to be
an infamous crime ? A larceny is a felony at
common law; and it is an infamous crime, and
as such, within the Constitution of the United
States, cannot be proceeded against m the man-
ner this bill provides. Article five of the
amendments to the Constitution provides that;
"No person shall be held to answer for a capital,
orotherwiseinfamouscrime.unlessona presentment
or indictment of a grand jury."
The jurisdiction here given to this police
court is to try these cases without the inter-
vention of a jury, and the bill declares that the-
prosecution shall be by information without
indictment. I submit that there is a certain
care over personal liberty designed by the-
Constitution of the United States which is in-
vaded by this provision. It is well enough to
apply this bill to "simple assaults and bat-
teries but there is a statutory offense of bat-
teries committed with an intent to commit fel-
onies, such as the intent to commit murder or-
assaults against the chastity of women, which
makes these crimes, in the ordinary .statutes
of the States, felonies. I suppose the word
u simple" here used would exclude all crimes-
of that character, but 1 suggest now that ins
line eight of the first section the word 1 i larceny: r
should be stricken out. Larceny is felony, and
I certainly consider a felony "an infamous
crime." X think that this provision is a vio-
lation of the fifteenth amendment of the Con-
stitution.
Mr. HAMLIN. I think the practice which
has obtained here since we have been a Gov-
ernment is a suffieientanswer to the suggestion
which the Senator makes. The word "sim-
ple," as used in the bill, applies to larcenies
as well as to assaults and batteries, and the
question arises what are simple larcenies? As
1 understand it, the administration of the crim-
inal law has been here in all cases, where the
value of the article stolen is less than thirty-
live dollars, to try the offender by the supreme
court without indictment.
Mr. BAYARD. Nevertheless, they would
be within the category known to legal defini-
tion as larcenies, which are felonies.
Mr. HAMLIN. They have been treated as
simple larcenies. They have been so treated
in the board of justices that have tried some
of these cases, and have bound others over.
The point was selected, precisely that which
corresponds with the practice here ; and it was
believed that the practice having obtained in
that way it was competent to frame a bill which
would authorize a police court to try a man
precisely as the supreme court has heretofore
tried him.
Mr. BAYARD. Then the usual legal defi-
nition would be different from that which cus-
tom apparently has created in this District.
There were grand larcenies and petty larcenies,
the difference between which was instituted by
the law of England, in their march of reform"!
to prevent the utterly shocking and repugnant
punishment of death being inflicted for so infe-
rior an offense. Therefore they instituted the
difference between grand and petit larceny,
excluding all small! hefts from the fearful pun-
ishment of the loss of life. Nevertheless, lar-
ceny is a felony.
Mr. DAVIS. Will the honorable Senator
allow me to makeasuggestion? I would remark
to him that my attention has been drawn to the
same objection to the bill which he suggests,
and it seems to me that it might be obviated by
adding a proviso providing that any person shall
be entitled to trial by jury in all cases where
that mode of trial is secured by the Constitu-
tion.
Mr. BAYARD. I would suggest, and prob-
ably it would meet the view of the honorable
Senator from Maine, to strike out the woid
"larcenies" and insert the word "misdemean-
ors." I think that is not capable of any legal
indefinitcness. Although the suggestion of the
honorable Senator from Kentucky would reach
the case, yet it would throw ou the court at all
times the duty of defining the matter. There
can be no question as to the legal meaning of
the word "larceny." It is a felony, and a
felony is an infamous offense. I submit the
