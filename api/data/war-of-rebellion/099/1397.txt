(Via Barbee's, 12. 30 p. m.)

General J. E. JOHNSTON,

Raleigh, N. C.:

The enemy, after being checked at Silver Run, retured toward Fayetteville. Hampton has transferred his command over Black River, to be in front of any movement upon Goldsborough. I heard nothing from Butler on the Clinton road during the night, and I am holding my command here awaiting further information. Prisoners say Sherman is receiving supplies at Fayetteville, by water, from Wilmington.

Colonel T. J. LIPSCOMB:

Your two dispatches by courier (yesterday's date) came last night. On our arrival here yesterday afternoon a courier was dispatched to you, by direction of the general commanding, advising you that headuqarters are here for the present, and instructing you to so modify the disposition of your command as to adapt it to the change here made, still covering and holding in observation the approaches from Fayetteville northward and eastward, and to send your reports her einstead of to Goldsborough. These instructions or enow repeated. Your report is a little indefinite as to the crossing of the enemy at Blockersville, and proceeding up the Warsaw road. Have you since ascertained such to be the fact? It will be necessary that you send a courier daily to me to report positions, discoveries, &amp;c. Your order to Lieutenant Stack
