FARMVILLE, April 7, 1865.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

The Second Corps and Crook's cavalry are north of the river at this place. I have no report yet of appearances in their front, but hear contradictory reports-one, that Lee is going to Maysville [Marysville?]; another, that he will strike south by roads farther up the river. I think, on the whole, you had better throw your cavalry up the river toward Chickentown to watch the different crossings. The Twenty-fourth Corps will move up the south bank of the river. Just as this was written some of our men who were captured last night have returned. They state that just as they left about 1,000 cavalry were thrown out toward the crossings above here. You may be able to get in the rear of the enemy, possibly. It is reported among the citizens here that Lynchburg was evacuated last night. I do not doubt but Stoneman is there.

Lieutenant-General.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Commanding Armies of the United States:

GENERAL: I am moving the cavalry column on Appomattox Depot. There ae eight trains of cars at that point to supply Lee's army. Everything is being run out of Lynchburg toward Danville. Our troops are reported at Liberty. This must be Stoneman. One of my scouts reports this. Possibly it may not be true.

Very respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
