MILLEN, November 26, 1864.

General SAMUEL JONES:

About 10,000 prisoners of war will probably go to Florence. Wheeler says Kilpatrick has gone toward Augusta, and he will follow after him with all his cavalry except one brigade. Enemy entered Sandersville to-day in force.

W. J. HARDEE,

Lieutenant-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., November 27, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Augusta:

It was intended your command should extended to the coast and embrace all combinations against the present movements of the enemy. General Hardee will receive instructions from you to insure unity and concert of action.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

AUGUSTA, November 27, 1864.

Honorable j. A. SEDDON:

Your dispatch of to-day is received. Unable to decline a responsibility of such magnitude so unexpectedly transferred to me. In assuming it I must candidly express my belief that no practicable combinations of my available men can avert disaster.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

AUGUSTA, November 27, 1864.

(Received 28th.)

Colonel JOHN B. SALE,

Military Secretary of Richmond:

We have lost communication with the front. A small cavalry raid cut the Savannah railroad and telegraph this morning at Brier Creek, twenty-six miles from here. General Wheeler was yesterday confronting the enemy's infantry at Sandersville. An officer who left Macon on the 23rd states that one corps of the enemy was still confronting us there, our force not exceeding 5,000; nearly all militia. The force here, including all available resources, does not exceed 6,000 effectives; only one battery. I am not yet advised from Charleston and Savannah, but know the means are small. Neither point could long resist the enemy's whole force; hence my remark about concentration. General Hardee has gone to Savannah. Wheeler will continue to confront and harass the enemy. I have not learned the strength of his command. He estimates the enemy's force at about 30,000.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
