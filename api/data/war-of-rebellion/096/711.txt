Captain SAMPLE,

Company L, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry:

CAPTAIN: I anticipate a guerrilla raid to-night. Have your men all ready for service at any moment. Place pickets along the bay side in order that you may receive notice at once of any landing. Should any guerrillas land in your district, telegraph at once, or if the line is cut send picket.

FRANK J. WHITE,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding U. S. Forces.

(Same to Lieutenant Strong, Pungoteague, and Lieutenant Bowman, Onancock.)

SERGEANT IN COMMAND, CHERRYSTONE:

An attack is apprehended to-night. You will keep your guards properly posted and your men ready at the stockade, and when you see anything like an attack let me know by a special picket immediately.

Brigadier-General KENLY,

Salisburg:

I can not ascertain that any guerrillas have yet landed. If you can send to Drummondtown two companies of cavalry I may find them necessary. I have but 250 men, detached at posts over eighty miles of country. I think the rebels will land in this neighborhood.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

There is on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad from Harper's Ferry, not including Harper's Ferry, between 12,000 and 14,000 men. This includes the posts of Beverly, Philippi, Buckhannon, and Bulltown, which are covering the railroad. There will be in the Shennandoah Valley, after I leave, one brigade of cavalry near Winchester, one regiment of cavalry at Charlestown, and one regiment of cavalry at Duffield's Station, in all not less than 2,000 men, and when the force is increased by the men at Remount Camp it will number at least 4,000; then there will be the division of the Nineteenth Army Corps at Winchester and on the military railroad. This seems to me to be ample
