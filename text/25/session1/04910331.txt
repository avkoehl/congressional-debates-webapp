Making public officers depositories—Mr. Johnson*
H. of Reps.
luoaderand m>re geneial signification, ds the inducement or
motive of h/man action, but in its strict technical sense, bs the
pecuniary advantage requisite to the legal validity of a contract,
as contradistinguished from a nude pact To illustrate the
meaning of the term, in this application of it, Mr S would not
quote himself, but would resort to the unequivocal and autho
ritative language of the highest judicial tribunal
[Here Mr S read autho-met , showing that, if the peifor-
manee of an agreement between two pai ties might involve ha
zaid, service, or expenditure, to one party, and pecuniary ad
vantage to the other, such agreement contained a valid legal
consideration, the slightest degree of pecuniary advantage be
mgsufficient to cieate such consideration j
*VEi   S iht n   HiC'clJ    At ilvii' f'i-**, plain punciples to
thean mgeir ent vv'neh wt^enteial into between the Geneial
Government <i nd the State*,, can anv one fail to perceive that it
contained all the attributes of a strictly legal and technical con
tract?   Whatweie the fact**   T ie Telei^l Government found
itself tug ownei of an immense «utplus, scattered among nnu
merable local ban^s, of limited capitals, and ¡torne perhaps ef
doubtful responsibility    The=ecoipotations, prompted by the
semi authoritative encouragement of the late Secretary of the
Tieasuiy, and stimulated by the desire of gain, were flooding
the country with issues, ana bloating it with a seeming píos
penty    In this state of things it was deemed wise and pru
dent (and so it undoubtedly was) to withdraw our immense
revenues fiom these questionable depobitoiies, and place them
wheie ihey would be safely and sccmely kept and returned,
when wanted, upon thepiescnbed leims    Sn, did not this
condition of things picsent the stiongcbt possible mdu( ement*,
for the new arrangement1   Is not the safe keeping and prompt
letitin of your immense treasures  a dnect pecumiry ad van
uge to this Government?   Let the gioans which have u>«ucd
from the "white house ' and fiom the head oí your financial de
pirtment—let the bills which burden your table, and the scenes
11 which we are now now engaged answer the question    Sir,
had your revenues been deposited as they weie collected with
the States, instead of bemj; poured into the laps of your "pets,"
to be by them distributed m laigcsses to their pets, we should
have been spared this blacklist of millions upon millions of
1 unavailable funds," a list, it may be remarked, which would
have been vastly augmented but for that very law which we
now hear stigmatized asa nude pact
Such were some of the pecuniaiy advantages which, accoid
i ig to Mr 8 the Government had derived from her participa
tion m thi<i contract But, continued he, tun to the States
take New York, for example Did sue not encounter pecuniaiy
" haz irds ' when she assumed the tesponsibility of the "'bale
keeping and repayment" of upwatds, of five nnhions of yom
money 1 Aie you quite sure that she will siivUm no lof&when
the time comes for gathenna m and paym0 back this ímmei se
sumí Did not New Yoik pevfoim a valuable' bei vice" to this
Government when she took upon hei^elf the duty of sateiy
investing so large a shaie v( yom surplus revenue? Knú his
she not alieady made large ' expenditu es ' m performing this
service—m legislation, the payment of officei , investigating
title*, recoidingsecunties, and m various othei forms which
cannot be estimated? I woald not be buipused, sir, were the
aggiegate expense to the Government and people of my State,
co ¡sequent upon the execution ofthen part of this contract, to
amount to $200000 And it should be obseived ilia noadh
tion 1 chaiges of this natuie woulu be íequucd upon the pay
ment of the money now proposed to be withheld, the imc-4
inent of it having always been made so that, so far as "New
Yoik is concerned, beneficial ub^ could alone flow nam the
payment of the ir sr'rpent now due
Mr ■  had dwelt it such length upon this dry subjs t, wi h
the hope (a pieoumptuous one, he feared) of ehsembariasbing
the bub&eqnent debates upon the bill of a needles difficulty
which had buheito gifitly e icumh  ed md Letiuled then piu
gioss
He (Mr S ) vu dd n-\ the p it c of tl c ro i mttee w i 'e
he dituiHHul to eont oceit wuit i liua posutui d^suintc' by
the ftieiuK ot t ie bill wh ch seemed to him equally untenable
wi h thu ihed !y consideied
It ia insisted by gentlemen (said ^Xi $ ) whodo not seem jm p
pieparcdtoiegaid tne engagement of this Government as an
absolute nullity, that the b 11 only pioposes to effect in one
way what, by the e^pre s terms of the contract, might be done
in another "Ii,'' bay the e gentlemen, we can jpithdiaw
the money actually deposited with me States, why may we
not withhold that which leuanib in our hands? It cannot
nake any diffeience with the State, and they can have no
objection ' If he (Mi 8 ) had succeeded in proving the omd
in  foice of the contiact, then even stru t. cons ructiom&ts must
seeihattheyhadnomoie powei to alter oi modify, titan re
voke or lebeind, an entire contiaot, without the consent of all
the pai ties m interest Was the soveieiguty of the State of
New Yoik íepiesented on thw lluoi, and consenting to this
course, no objection would then exist to the proposed new
artangement But no right appeitains to the repiesentatives
oi noitions of that State, in this House to negotiate for a new
bai^ain They did not come heie clothed with that power
Í belongs to the Legislature of the State of New York, m
So ¡ate and Assembly convened, *o whom alone it is delegated
ííut the proposed change is not by any means immaterial to
thft People of that State True, Congress may recall the money
derowtJd, but howl Look ai your statute' Thnty thousand
dollars is the utmost that can be withdrawn m that y days If
the bill on the table becomes a law, upwards of S 1,300,000 ate
withheld Now, pay over that sum, then withdraw all the law
«einuw, and by the interest on the balance, a calculation might
be made of the immateriality oí this, ineasuie to his consti
mente Beside- what security have they that as soon as you
nave determined to wifhhold what is due to them, the pressing
necessities of tl is Government may not impose «Ponrtthe
ra ifulduty of leeallmga poition of the deposites? Mr S
iad no confidence-he could not have any onfidence-that an
Adimnisuauon, whose appetite foi money had not been.gorged
upon forty millions a yeai, would stay its hand until it had
.Uutched every dollar within its reach
lie called the attention ef the committee to the condition of
the countiy—to tfie f&ct that contracts had been made between
the States and .hen people, between citizen and citizen, that
public works had been undertaken, laborers employed, ys
terns of impiovementaAd education undertaken oi expanded,
and the mamiold affairs of men arranged upon the basis of the
deposite law Wa* it wise oi jusü "Was it not ciuel aad
perfidious- to throw derangemeut, dibappomtment, and coniu
won, into all those relations of society?   The «ountw wa* Kfag
genng under revulsions    Ought it to be stucken againj wiUioat
allowing it time to rally and stand erect*
It had been said that none oí these disappointments, or de
rangemente, could reach the people of New Yoik, because
their expectations were to be m^t from then own treasury
git was true that the financial head of that Government had
resolved, duung the recee^of the Legislature—as H tl e pas&age
of this bill had been predetermined—to put foith its resources
in such an emergency    But, what funds does that officer pjo
pose to substitute foi the money which the Fedeial Govern
ment had engaged to deposite in his hands'?   The revenues of
the Erie and Champlam canals, of couise     These are the
ready resort m all cases when money is wanted for any pui
pose    Those fund  ought to bu dedieate 1, he could almost aay
consecrated to thepeifectun of that system of internal improve
ment, devised for New Yoik by hci immoital statesman, and
pio&eeuted by the eneigies of her people, until it had placed
that bu e upon the piuud eminence she holds among her sis
tei  of tno Republic    In a eeuain contingency, not unlikely to
happen, these funds might be íequned to complete the enlarge
ment ot the Lnc canal, a woik already begun, and in the rapid
completion of which western New Yoik, particularly, had a
deep interest    The sooner that work was done the sooner
would the prices of transportation upon ltbeieduced, and as
the co* t of tiansportation was chiefly borne by the producei,
every farmer throughout the extended legion which sends us
pioductions to the seaboaiu, upon that gieat channel of trade,
had a direct inteiest in the question here pending
The fuend^of the New Yoik canals would nevei have con
sented, upon the dnect proposition, to the distribution of near
ly a million aud a hall of her canal funds, amongst all the towns
ii that State, and they cannot, consistently, vote foi a bill which
musf, if it becomes a law, produce the bame result
That money, if it 'hall be required for the purposos of the
canals, can only bo recxlled by a vote oí the Representatives
from al I parts of tin S ate When that questi in arises, antago
met interests may come along with it, and the restoration of
the money, so scattered throughout the ¡state, might encounter
setious, ifnotsuccessful lesintance In thelattei event, the de
ficiency could only be supplied by continuing, or increasing,
the high tolls of the Lue canal
Mr S represented a di3Uic almost exclusively agricultural,
bordering upon the Ene canal, and it was his forecast oftha
possible consequences ol this measure upon interests confided,
in some degree, to 1m eaie, that Imd ©veicume an almost mvin
cible leluctaiicc to throw huncelf upon the indulgence of the
committee
He would not giopc in the thick diikuctb oí the report of
tha Sla retar of the 1 reasury to find out by it whethei he had
the fuids to y the fourth instalment Inese funds were in
theTiQasury on thebr t day of Jmuarylasi for we had Ins

pose youretieiieh sume of your cno-mou  and useless expendí

I feel (said Mr J ) how perilous my simation is m attempting
to follow the learned and distinguished member who has just
taken his  e t At this late hour, too when the committee
have been so long in se sion, 1 am strongly appitdiensive that
1 may not compense them f any portion of their attention
I must thertfoie, throw my eitupon then magnanimity But
before 1 enter upon the sublet nndei discussion 1 leel it d. duty
which I owe to myself and to oiheit, '0 give a pas nag notice to
an observation which fell fiom the honoiable member win
last addie sed the committee
The honoiable jiember lemarked ra the couise of his ol)
sei vation , in substance, that the friend  of the Administration,
01 some of them, had said that the Opposition had, a few yeais
ago, made ch-iKi agamst the Post Office Depaitment, and,
among c fliers l " ft lend, the late Tos, matter Geneial, and that
the 4dmmistiation saenficed somi o< the metnbeis of tint
Department (at least the chief clerk) to the avenging deity oi
the ielentle«s Opposition I do not iu one moiionteuppo-e
(sanl Mr J ) that the honorable gentleman puipo-ed any per

having been 1 member of the twenty thud Congies , when tile
administiauon 01 the Post Ofh( e D&panmeiu was made a sub
ject of tpecial examination ¿nd the rer on upon that examina
tion was submitted to this House, I felt it my duty to take ai

committed in that Dcpirin'iv    <Ul uiv name lav 1 ¡. \JM\

and with a colli ion with the late Postmastei Geneial and his

said, and in gn >nj an explanation which cucumstances at the

When a bill wi-, under discussion in this House giYinf, as I
thoj¿ht, increisod patronage to that Depaitment, I took occa
sion to oppose ito passage, and to animadvert upon the corrup-
tions which weie proved to exist 111 it A spirit of intimida-
tion then still lingered m thi~ hall, and cleaily manifested itbolf,
I tnought, on the night of that discussion, for, duung that ses
