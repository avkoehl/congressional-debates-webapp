CINCINNATI, July 14, 1863.

Colonel NEFF, Camp Dennison:

Do you hear anything from your scouts in the direction of Batavia of the rebels that were reported yesterday?

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CAMP DENNISON, July 14, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I have a report from one of my trusty orderlies. He crossed over to Miamiville. The rebels have all passed. An old and respectable citizen told him that he heard some of them talking, and they said they were going to Batavia, which I think very likely. He reports them badly armed and mounted. They took all the horses they could find. This road leads into the Batavia pike, 6 miles beyond Milford. They may send a squad down to cut telegraph wires and injure the railroad. I have succeeded in saving the railroad bridge over Miami River, at Miamiville.

NEFF,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

CAMP DENNISON, July 14, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

I left General Morgan's headquarters about 10 o'clock, at which time his rear passed. The general and staff [mounted], armed, followed a few hundred yards in the rear, which was about 2 miles east of Miamiville. I think he has 2,500 or 3,000 men, armed only with rifles. They have three sections of artillery. The men and horses are very much jaded. In the event of an engagement, three out of four dismount; the fourth takes charge of the horses. I think they are making for Batavia. They are leading no horses and have no train.

Colonel PATTERSON, Aurora, Ind.:

The large majority of the enemy are near here. There can be no large force near you. No preparation are made here to prevent their crossing near you. You must concert measures with Colonel Gavin, at Lawrenceburg.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

JULY 14, 1863.

Governor MORTON, Indianapolis:

Morgan has crossed the Little Miami at Miamiville. Neff succeeded in saving the bridge and the camp. General Hobson is in pursuit, and we are making arrangements here to-day to try to intercept Morgan. He is reported to be going to Batavia. I am much obliged for your offer of Indiana troops. I shall probably order them to this place, and send the troops I have here in pursuit of the enemy.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

[Same to Governors Tod and Robinson.]
