Reports of Captain George B. Currey, First Oregon Cavalry, commanding expedition.
HDQRS. EXPEDITION INTO THE INDIAN COUNTRY, Camp No. 1, on Walla Walla River, eight miles from Fort Walla Walla, Wash., Ter., April 28, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to report that I took up my line of march for the Indian country this day and arrived here this afternoon. It is with great pleasure that I acknowledge myself under many obligations to yourself and Colonel English, commanding officer at Fort Walla Walla Wash, Ter., for very superior outfit with which I am supplied. I have 104 pac-mules loaded and eight six-mule teams. With this I am enabled to start with ninety days' rations for my command. I considerable portion of the subsistence stores which were sent to Fort Walla Walla, Was. Ter., for the use of my expedition, remains there, as my amount of transportation was insufficient to move it. The troops under my command, ninety-one in the aggregate, are in good condition and fine spirits. The amount of ammunition for my pistols which I have with me is insufficient for the entire campaign, and I most respectfully urge upon you the necessity of forwarding to me at an early day at least 10,000 additional rounds.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,GEO. B. CURREY,

Captain, First Oregon Cavalry, Commanding Expedition.

HDQRS. EXPEDITION INTO THE INDIAN COUNTRY, Camp No. 6, on Grande Ronde River, May 3, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that I reached this camp, on Grande Ronde River, at the eastern base of the Blue Mountains, on yesterday. I experienced no difficulty in crossing the Blue Mountains; had fair weather and much better roads then I expected before starting. Uma-how-lits (war chief of the Cayuse tribe) and ten of his warriors joined me at Lee's encampment, on the Blue Mountains. They are fine-looking fellows, well mounted, and seem very anxious to return with some war trophies. I could have selected more Indians, but after making calculations concerning subsistence and the amount of transportation under my command, I did not deem it prudent to take more. I remained in camp to-day to permit the animals to rest and graze, as there was little feed upon the mountain. I start in the morning at 6 o'clock, my usual hour for commencing the day's march.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,GEO. B. CURREY,

Captain, First Oregon Cavalry, Commanding Expedition.
