THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 11,
to present He should be opposed now to the
-estoration of the deposites, because the inevitable
esult of such a measui e wou'd be the rechartermg
of the Un.ted States Bank It was true, that it
flad been denied by many gentlemen that theie
was any connection between the two questions
But what did they hear' Were they not told that
it was impossible for the Government to carry on
lis financial operations without a fiscal agent, and
that, without such agency, the whole of our rev-
enue system would be involved in rum? There
were many who contended that the questions were
distinct, and, while they were insisting on the
restoration of the deposites, declared that they had
no desue to touch the question of chartering ihe
bank, but it was evident that, while affecting to
hate the traitor, they chenshed the treason If
the bank possessed all this power to cripple the
commerce of the country, to shackle industi y, and
injure our maikets.it was an establishment lepug
nant to the Constitution, and one which might
ultimately seize the reins of Goveinment If it
possessed all the tremendous power, in time of
peace, what if, in the moirent of wai, it should
take upon itself the power to control all the State
banks' It was his settled opinion, that if, ma
great war of national rights, the stockho'ders of
the United States Bank should choose to anay
themselves against the Government, as was the
case with some of the owners of capital in ihelast
war, they could arrest all the operations of the
country, stop the progiess of resistance, and com
pel the Government to conclude a tieaty—n dis
graceful tieaty C mid he sanction the institution
when it was admitted to possess such power'
Although he plactd a high value on the honor of
a seat on this floor, if he weie constrained to hold
it only as the advocate of such an institution, the
seat wou'd lose all its value in his estimation, and
he would sunender it without i egret
What did the Senate alieady begin to see' In
Pennsylvania, wheie the bank wasnituated, public
opinion was i is ng up against it The honest and
indignant voice ot the people were denouncing it
It had been tiled by a jury of the vicinage—tiled
by its own State—and there was no doubt that
the public judgment would be recorded agiinst it
Enteitaumig these views, and wiihout desiring to
throw any imputation on other gentlemen, he had
found himself impelled to offer them to the Senate
lie could not doubt tint his colleague, m present
ing his lemaiks on offering the resolutions, tad
honestly obeyed the convictions ot his mind,
anil, whne he accorded this tribute of justice
to him, he hoped to receive for himself an equal
chirity
One word fuilher lie protested ngamst the
influence of this bank bung exerted m his S ate
lie denied that ti e State was in any way depend
ent on the institution I heie was nevei agiettei
degtee of prospenty amoi g the people linn at this
time Its population consisted of industnous
farmeis, medíame , and [lanteis, and over these
he denied that the bails had any contiol They
had tl en own rcsouico, diawn from then in
dustry, by means of which they earned on their
own opeiations No national bank could leach
them They were entirely beyond its influence
and contiol
It had been stated, in a letter presented by his
colleague to the Senate, mid which h id been i en 1,
timt s ime of the notes of the Slate banks had oeen
n* eight pei cent discom t in the western part of
Noiih C u   ma That bank was in a  gr-od credit
aa any bank in the Union It was a specie ,payii g
bank, and all that he should say was, that if its
notes weieata discount of eight pei cent in the
State, it was a g—atei discount than was asked in
New ioil>, or anywheie else In New Yoik, he
beheved the ducourt was, ot ly trio per cent , and
it was «Tang , in leed, if it >vas two pei cent in
We at Yoi it, and eight per cent at ho ne He rail
noticed in a lerent paner, that commissioneis had
been appoi ited to leceive subscnptions of stock
f>r a new bank, and they weie receiving tl t notes
of the State bink for stock, because it was a
spec e pay ng bank Theie was a difficulty in
seiectm  i. bai 1 in th  State for the public depos
Ups, un il there had oeen an aaion of t! e I pgH -
ture ot the subject II s co'lesgue hat «aid, that
the fl irse was extending in the mountain legion,
that this was one of the strongholds of the Ad
ministration, but that the flame was spreading  i
and threatening a geneial conflagration     Now,
he himself had no doubt that North Carolina '
would sustain the Administration, that the opin-
ions of the people, republican as they weie, were
decidedly against domestic foes as well as foieign
enemes,  and   would  support   the Goverrment
against both     He had no doubt that these mount-  ¡
am men—mostly the descendants of that gallant
j band which so valiantly maintained the honor of
I their country at Aing's Mountain—would, on <his
¡ occasion, exhibit a firmness and courage which
would not dishonor the achievement of that day
Mr BENTON asked what could be the object   I
in punting so many names as were appended to
this memorial toice ovei ?    They had been  or-
dered to be printed in the other House already.
I     Mi   WEBSTER said that the gentleman fiom
Noith Carolina [Mi   Crown] had sdveited to the
rates of exchange of certain Lank notes     lie said
that the bills, of Noith Carolu a weie at a discount
of two per cent     The puces current ot January
24th last, rate the notes of North  Carolina ata
discount of five per cent    Those of Kemucky at
[ from five to eight   Alabama eight to twelve    The
notes of Louisiana and Mississippi at eight to
twelve     In these States, in August last, North
Carolina notes were at one and a half to two
South Carolina one and a half to two     Kentucky
four to six, and he supposed these indications of
il e cuirency and rate of exchange were as coirect
as any      He had but one word more to siy     The
gentleman had repeated what had often been re-
peated, and what was a subject only fit foi a fur-
ther lnquiiy, that the bank was  making every
efioit to prouuee thepiessure and distress which
now exists     Woj d the gentleman tell us what
the bank has done, and what it should not do '  He
surely did not mem to take up the common cry,
founded upon no data     If the bank has not dis-
counted to the utmost of its ab lity, 3how us the
giounds for the objection     What are his grounds'
So fai as we know,it has not curtailed a dollai of
its accommodations beyond the amount of depos-
ites removed from it     We see fiom its condition
in New York, where it had three millions of de
posites, and has now but $75,000, it has discounted
to the amount of half a million     This did not
rem like screwing down the community     Mr
i W  wished what the bank had done to be known,
' and so far as there was any known fact in relation
to its conduct, he shouM inteirupt ro gentleman
in exposing it     But he tl ought the charge ought
to be m ide so that the people may judge whether
the bank was in fault or not
I     Mr  BiBB was one of those who desired to
repel the idea of wishing to recharter the United
States Built     He was no bank man, and never
had been     He was hostile to that bank, «uid to all I
the State banks, but if we were compelled   to |
submit to one of many evils, he would choose the '
least, he wtuld lather oppose the whole sys em,
hut if he must submit to a tyrant, he would tathei
yHd to ore than to four bundled     Ihe man who
should invent a ililfeient sort of system  than the
piesent,  which  shall press so  lightly upon   the j
business, the debits and credits of the country, |
as that ti ey cannot be materially ailected  by it,
should hive his 1 ear'y support     This, however,
was n it the question , lesentedm these me norial , I
but it was convenient to seize on them as íeasons
foi evad n g the true causes of the distress     Theie
wss nothi ig in the natural elements ciluilued to !
Lause all this a'am and disquietude     The m im-
plication of fhese isemorials attested the fact of the '
stoppage of tl e money concerns of the countty   |
11 ere is a deep distress, a col' mildew which has
benumbed the commeicu.l and business transan
lm¡> of the couitiy     It is so, or gentlemen are
mat entne to the sources of information   they are
the representations of merchants, dealers, and tra- ¡
ders, speaking the language of soberness and truth
1 he eherter of tue bank is a contract made by the
authorities of the Goveinment, and sai canned by
the Supre ne Couitof the United States, and now '
to refuse to aoii'e by the teims or the contract and
cany it into effect, would be to stu'tify the Con
gress vhich "n?de the bank, 'or Pies dent Jackson
tostilnfv Piesidoit Mad son      It is a contract far
w.iich a ionsideiation has been given, and he fj<-
one, wou (I rot be wiling to tin ish tl e faitn of ]r
tne Government m theeyeoof Eutopt and thecw-
llized vvoild by proclaiming that the former Con-
gress did not know their duty By the eighth
article of the bank chartei it was íequnedand com-
pelled to confine its debts within its capital, and by
its charter it was bound to curtail i s debts and its
discounts in propoition to the íeduction of its pub-
lic and private deposites, and lie would presume
that it had done ail this, until some actual case to
the contrary was brought to Ins mind. He was
a Republican, but he was equally opposed to the
tumult of demociacy as he was to the calm of des-
potism He was in favor of the wilt of the people
to be expressed in its most effective form
Mr BROWN wished to say a word or two in
reply to the gentleman from Massachusetts He
had refetred to the rate of exchange to show the
value of North Carolina and other notes at Phil-
adelphia. I (said Mi B) had remarked that North
Carolina notes of the State Bank were at two or
three per cent in the northern cities, and had in-
ferred that they could not have depreciated down
to eight per cent in their own State, when they
were at two per cent at so remote a distance It
seemed that North Carolina notes v ere reported
at only five per cent discount in Philadelphia,
which was not so much as the abeged discount in
the western part of North Carolina * But he con-
sideied the Philade'phia market to be-an unsafe
guide, as it was under the control of biokers who
might be connected with the bank, and nothing
could be more easy than for a combination of tra-
ders, who w shed to depreciate the price of i otes
for a few weeks, to do so 13ut they were not so
omnipotent as to be able to do this for any length
of time There were no notes in bettei credit than
those of the North Carolina State Bank, which was
a specie paying bank The banks in the State
weie in the possession of pub'ic conidence, their
chai ers were on the po nt of expiring, except one,
which had been lately recharteied by the Legisla
ture, and they weie in the daily fulfilment of their
obligations Ihe gentleman from Massachusetts
had stated that he (Mr B ) had made grave
charges against the bank, and asked him for the
proof He thought that there was strong proof
before the world. What was its corduct when
the public deposites weie at first removed ' D d it
not immediately curtail its discounts to an amount
far beyond that which had been wi hdiawn' The
gentleman fiom Pe insylvania [Mr Wjlkins] had,
some diys since, read a papei to show that bills
of exchange were sold on Letter terms by some of
the State bai ks of Pennsylvania than by the Uni-
ted States Bank, showing the disposition on the
part of the United States Bank to embanass the
domestic exchange That was some proof What
othei proof was there' Its rapid and great cui •.ail-
ments of its accommodations everywhere, except,
perhaps, in New York, where it might have pur-
sued a different policy Theie was vet an amount
of ten millions of S| ecie in its vaults, yet it con-
tinued to reduce its discounts The great danger
was in the secret opeiations of the bank If all its
schemes could be developed, and the public could
have a knowledge of all its secret machinery, which
was employed in spreading distress through the
community, they would discovei that, like the elec-
tric stroke, it was not seen until it had fulfilled its
fatal mission
M- MANGUM said he reciprocated the kind-
est feelings towards his col'eague The Philadel-
phia stock market had been objected to by him
Peihaps he would have none to the New York
market, where the stme puces prevailed ¿The
question was not one of bank or no bank, but to
restore the faith of the Government, and to repair
the injury inflicted on it
Mr PRFSTO^ entered the Sera'e Chamber
with much agitation, just as Mr MaívGlii had
closed his remaiks, when,
Mr PORSYIH having obtained the floor, gave
way to-~-
Mr PRESTON, who smd he did not nse with
* Mr Brown d -ems it his duty to state, that
since the debate which occurred in the Senate on
tins sibjfcr, he has seen the " Mornn g Courier
and New York E qmrer," dated on the 8 h in
stant, and that the rate of diseourt in the city of
New York, as given m thet p^per, on the notes of
the several bmks of Nortl Caroi na,is fiom 2. to
3 per cent only
