suffering very much, and that they could not long continue the contest; however, Major Latimer held his ground till several of his pieces had been silenced by the loss of the gunners, &amp;tc., when he ordered the guns to the rear. We rendered him good services in assisting his cannoneers with their pieces. Here we had a private killed, and a second lieutenant and one private wounded. It was now determined to attack the enemy upon their own ground, and in the line of battle this regiment occupied the right of the brigade, which was also the right of our lines on that portion of the field. The enemy occupied a very strong position, being the crest of a range of wooded, craggy hills. To reach their lines, we were compelled to advance for half a mile through open fields, at the same time receiving the fire from their batteries and skirmishers; but our whole line moved forward in handsome order. About sunset we came to close range, and till long after dark the fighting was kept up with great fury. We tried again and again to drive the enemy from their position, but at length we were compelled to fall back, worn down and exhausted, but not till every round of cartridge had been discharged. At one time we were within a few feet of their works, but the fire was so heavy we could not stand it. It may be well to state here that when we fell back we carried every one of our killed and wounded with us to the base of the hill. This night we slept at the base of the hill, about 300 yards from the enemy's lines. The day following [July 3] was spent without any important operations on our part, we barely skirmishing some little. On the night of the 3d, we withdrew from the contest entirely. Our loss is 15 killed, 67 wounded, and 17 missing. * The regiment as a body behaved exceedingly well, and fully sustained the reputation they have heretofore won; but in the line of officers there was not in one or two instances that high and chivalrous bearing which I would like to see exhibited. However, while I am sorry to say that one or two of the officers did not behave so well as they ought, yet the others conducted themselves exceedingly well.

Major L. J. Perkins conducted himself with his usual courage, and deserves much praise for his conduct. To the senior captain [F. W. Kelly] I am also much indebted for his constant and laborious services. To Second Lieutenant Isaac Weston, Company B, who received a severe blow on the head, but would not leave the field, much credit is due. He was in the command of his company, and well sustained the true bearing of the Southern officer. Private A. F. Senteo, Company H, detailed with the ambulance corps, rendered most excellent service in carrying the wounded away from the field. In one or two instances he, with friends of the wounded, brought them from the immediate vicinity of the enemy's lines.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. H. N. SALYER,

Lieutenant Colonel, Comdg. 50th Va. Regiment, 2nd Brig., Johnson's Div.

Captain REUBEN CLEARY,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
