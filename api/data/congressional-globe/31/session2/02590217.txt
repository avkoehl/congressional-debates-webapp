of the Union had been renewed under the provisions
of that law. Hence it was necessary, that for the
first year money should be drawn from the Treas-
ury to meet the deficit in the revenues of the Post
Oflice Department; and although $750,000 were
appropriated, only $650,000 of that sum was drawn
from the Treasury. There was also a provision
in that law, requiring the Government to pay the
postage upon communications sent and received by
such officers of the Government as had, prior to
that time, enjoyed the franking privilege; that also
went in to aid the revenues for that year; but at a
subsequent Congress this provision of the law was
repealed, and in lieu of keeping accounts of the
postage upon letters sent ana received by Execu-
tive officers who had, prior to that time, enjoyed
the franking privilege, an annual appropriation of
(300,000 was made, and from that time up to the
present day, not one dime of that money has been
expended, as is shown by the reports of every Post-
master General from that time up to the present
day. There was a balance of $65,000 for the first
fiscal year after that law took effect, and that bal-
ance has been continued in the Treasury to the
credit of the Post Office Department accumulating
each year, amounting on the 30th of June last to
upwajds of $655,000, as shown by the report of
the Postmaster General and the report of the Au-
ditor of the Treasury for the Post Office Depart-
ment.
I. judge, from the remarks of the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mr. Sweetser,] and from the manner in
which he propounded his interrogatories to me,
that he is laboring under the impression that the
annual appropriation of-$200,000 has been ex-
pended in each year since that law was passed.
Mr. SWEETSER. Then why was a call made
for the appropriation ?
Mr. PHELPS. I will show the gentleman why
a call was made for the appropriation. I hold in
my hand the report of the late Register of the
Treasury, (Mr. Gillett,) or, rather, the report of
the late Secretary of the Treasury, (Mr. Walker,)
showing the amount allowed and paid out of the
Treasury during the year ending June 30, 1846,
for the postage of the Executive Departments of
the Government and of the several officers and
persons who were authorized, by the laws in force
prior to the passage of the act of the 3d of March,
1845, to send or receive matter through the mails,
free of postage. I would remark, that the act of
1845 provided that thos  officers should keep an
account of the matter received by them through the
mail on business appertaining to the duties of their
respective offices, and that their accounts'should
be paid out of the Treasury; for that law abolished
the franking privilege except to members of Con-
gress, and to the Assistant Postmasters General
on official business, or business connected with
the Post Office Department. This report showed
that the amount which was paid in one year upon
communications received by various executive of-
ficers in this city, amounted to $250,383. The
Register of the Treasury estimated that there was
also a like amount due to the Post Office Depart-
ment upon communications which had been sent
from this city to officers who were authorized to
charge the postage upon their communications in
their accounts, and to have it refunded to them out
of the Treasury. In 1847 this act was passed,
appropriating $200,000 annually as a permanent
appropriatien, and the object of it was to dispense
with the necessity of keeping thoseaccounts which
these officers were required, Dy the act of 1845, to
keep. At that time the then chairman of the Com-
mitteeon the Post Office and Post Roads, [Mr. Hop-
kin*, of Virginia,] estimated that with that amount,
the Post Office Department could get along with-
out resorting to the Treasury, and the Jhen Post-
master General demonstrated that he could extend
the mail facilities, increasing them largely over the
mail facilities which were in operation in 1845,*
without touching one dollar of that appropriation.
And I know, that if you refer to a single report
made by the late Postmaster General, (Mr. Cave
Johnson) or to the report of Mr. Collamer, or to
the report of the present Postmaster General, you
will see that that balance and that accumulation of
the money appropriated from the Treasury still
remains unexpended, besides another balance of
# $649,000, available for the service of the Post Of-
* lee Department.
I now read from the report of the Postmaster
General: '
" The undrawn appropriations for this Department under
the 12th section of the act of 1847, before referred to,
amounted, on the 30th June last, (including the $200,000
embraced in the revenues of the last year, and included
in the foregoing balance,) to $685,556 55
" The Auditorofthe Department estimates the
balance to the credit of the revenue of the
Department on the day last mentioned,
which will be ultimately found to be avail-
able, (and wliich does not include the
$565,555 55 above mentioned,) at.   649,165 31
"Making an available balance, from all sources,
of. 1,314,790 86
The actual balance to the credit of the Post Office Depart-
ment, derived from revenue, is shown by the report of the
Auditor to be $893,078 11
But of this sum there is due from postmasters
prior to 1st July, 1845, the most of which it
it is believed cannot be recovered, the
amount of  245,912 80
properly, but this House, against the earnest op
position1 of that committee, so amended it as to
put it in the absurd shape that the gentleman from
Missouri complains of.
Mr. PHELPS. I differ with the chairman of
the Committee of Ways and Means on this mat-
ter. I recollect raising two objections to that post
office appropriation bill during the last session of
Congress, one of which was, that they had charged
the salaries of the Post Office Department here,
upon the revenues of that Department. The other
was, that the bill, as reported by the committee,
Available balance from revenue $649,165 31
This balance of $649,000 has accrued since the
30th of June, 1845. It is a balance, after defraying
the expenses of the Department, with the excep-
tion of the appropriation from the Treasury for
the year 1846, ana derived from postages.
When I speak of the expenses of the Post Of-
fice Department, I do not include in those expenses
the salaries of the Postmaster General, his three
Assistants, the Auditor of the Treasury for the
Post Office Department, and the clerks employed
in those offices. Those expenses have never, to
this day, been charged ofl the revenues of that De-
partment. They have, up to the present time,
Deen paid from the Treasury proper. I know that
at the last session of Congress there was an at-
tempt, on the part of the Committee of Ways and
Means, to introduce a reform, by which they
would charge the expenditures of the salaries of
all the officers (the Postmaster General excepted)
connected with the management of the post office
in this city, to the revenues of the Post Office De-
partment, and that attempt resulted in causing the
whole expenditure of the Post Office Department
to be paia out of the Treasury, and not out of the
revenues of the Post Office Department.
I know that it was an oversight, and that it was
the intention of the Committee of Ways and
Means to mhke what had hitherto been consid-
ered ttie expenses of the Post Office Department, a
charge upon the revenues of that Department, and
in doing that, they were desirous of making the
salaries of those engaged by the Department in
this city, a charge upon those revenues; but by
some oversight, they failed to accomplish their
object.
Mr. BAYLY, (interposing.) It was no over-
sight on the part of the Committee of Ways and
Means. Their bill, as it was drawn, was drawn

two
objections, but the House sustained the Committee
of Ways and Means. The amendment to which
the gentleman refers, was made in the Senate,and
this House concurred in that amendment, sup-
posing the expense of mail transportation, &c.,
were still payable out of the revenues of the Post
Office Department.
Mr. BAYLY. If the gentleman from Missouri
will allow me, I will state the facts. They are
these, and I recollect them so well that I cannot be
mistaken. The post office appropriation bill, as
it came from the Committee of Ways and Means,
contained in its enacting clause a provision that
the whole appropriations of the bill should be
paid out of the revenues derived from the Post
Office JDepartment. On motion of the gentleman
from Ohio, [Mr. Potter,] the enacting clause
was so changed as that the words " to be paid out
of the funds arising from the Post Office Depait-
ment" were stricken out, and the words inserted,
" any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise ap-
ariated by law;" and when they came down
at clause of the bill which provides for the
transportation of the mails, the gentleman who
had changed it did not choose to introduce the
phraseology, that the appropriations in this por-
tion of the bill were to be paid out of the funds
of the Post Office Department; and I, being opposed
to the change, did not choose to interfere. These
were the facta.
Mr. PHELPS, (in continuation.) I still differ
with the gentleman. So far as the amendment of
the gentleman from Ohio was concerned, it only
extended to the salaries of the Post Office Depart-
ment, those of all the Assistant Postmasters Gen-
eral, and their clerks-, the Auditor, and the clerks in -
the Auditor's office; it still left the expenses of the
PostOffice DepwUnentpayable out of die revenues
of that Department. The other change was made
in the Senate; but this is a matter immaterial to
this issue. I only adverted to it to show that with
all these attempts at reform the Post Office Depart-
ment was, after all, at the last session of Congress
charged directly upon the Treasury of the United
States, instead of being charged directly upon
the revenues of that Department. I am opposed
to any such system. I desire, as I have formerly
stated, to have the revenues of the Post Office De-
partment defray the expenses which have hither-
to been a charge upon the revenues of that Departs
ment. I believe that if the free matter sent through
the mails—I speak of that franked by members
of Congress, of that franked and received free of
postage by Executive officers and postmasters,
though I do not embrace public documents—was
charged with postage at the same rates that you
charge similar triail matter when sent and received
by persons hot entitled to the franking privilege, it
would give to the Post Office Department a revenue
over and above the salaries and expenses of the
management of it in this city. I could demon-
strate, from data which I have here, that the post-
age derivable from it would exceed the amount of
salaries of the Post Office Department.
At the last session of Congress these salaries
were estimated at $220,000 or $230,000. I am
ready to say $250,000, if you please, and the re-
port made by Secretary Walker, to which I have
before referred, shows that the amount of postage
at the present rate, charged upon free matter re-
ceived in one year ending the 30th of June, 1846,
by members of Congress in this city, and exec-
utive officers in this city, amounted to upwards of
$250,000; and according to his estimate the post-
age on all matter sent by mail, which before that
time had passed through it free, would have
amounted to an equal amount.
I seek not to abolish the franking privilege. It
would be a convenience to me, and doubtless it
would be to every member of Congress, if it was
