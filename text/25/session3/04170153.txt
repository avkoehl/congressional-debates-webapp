APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong....3d Sess.
Expenditures of the Government—Mr. Murray.
Ho. or Reps.
quoting the record witn the utmost exactitude, and
yet be false in effect, unfair, and unjust, to both
the Administration and the peopie. As I am now
beginning to undeistand this matter, I will say
a word in relation to it, that the people may be
warned to be on their guard, and to examine fully
bpfore they give in adhesion their belief, as it la not
ev .vthingthat shines m the dark that is fire in
reality, but often turns out, on examination, to be
fox fire, or something else Well, sn, to give you
an example a plain, honest farmer in the country
takes up a speech made in Congress by some
worthy orthodox high priest of the Opposition, and
he reads that "theexpendituresin 1828 amounted
to $13,296,041, and that the expenditures of 1837
are §39,164 OU0 " He sees that the latter sum is
three times the amount of the formei, and £"" the
speech is reolete with the high-sounding epithets
ot " corrup ion, " " extravagance, " " wasttful-
ness," "public p'underers, ' &c—for these gen-
tlemen have a vein of great richness in coining such
terms—he feels himself grow indignant at tne man-
nei m which the Administration is imposing on
the public Now it never occurs to the honest
man, that although the Whig orator is telling the
truth, he omits to tell the whole truth, and to make
the proper explanations required by candor and
fairness He is not informed that the expenditure
stated for 1828 is the ordinary and current expend-
iture of that year, anil that the amount stated for
18)7 is the gross expenditure, including all sums,
ordinary and extraordinary, and several millions
of dollars besides He is not told that the whole
exoenditure of 1828, including public debt, &f ,
amounted to $25,459,000, and that in the stated
amount expended m 1837, there is included
$5,610,404 of tiust funds for Indian tribes, and
indemnities recovered from other Governments for
oui own citizens, and which are, in fact, no ex-
penditure at all Nor is he informed that the ex-
cess of pensions in 1837, over the amount of pen-
sions in 1828, is $1,821,000, and that this sum is
increased to about $12,000,000 by expenses of
Florida war, repayments on drawbacks and de-
bentures, three and five per cent, funds to new
States, and investments for Indian lands, for all
of which no reasonable man will hold the Admin-
istration responsible Still less is he told of the
necessary augmentation in our expenditures from
the great increase in the growth of the country,
and in all the depaitments of business, besides
extraordinary appropriations foi improvements,
foi the benefit of commerce,exploring expedition,
&c , many of which owe their paternity to the Op-
position themselves
Now, sn, (continued Mr M ,) if implicit cre-
dence be given by the people to the oft-ieiterated
charges in reference to the late defalcations, which
have been made to give force and «pint to the
ceaseless torrent of abuse which has, without stint
or mercy, been poured upon the Administration
ftom the commencement of this session to the
present time, they must have concluded that a
new era of corruption and waste had taken place
in the history of the Government They could
come to no other conclusion than that little or no
money was ever lost by the Government until
General Jackson was called to the Piesideucy
Smely they must have been lost in wonder, ay,
horror struck, at the wastefulness and prodigihty
of that incompetent and reckless functionary Still
more must they have wondered at the inconceiv-
able folly of advocating any other mode of keeping
safely the public moneys, than that of permitting
the bank corporations of the country to keep and
manage all our financial matters, seeing that eveiy
sensible man must know that speculators are moie
to be trusted than anybody else Yes, they are
more considerate and righteous, coming up even
to the scriptural injunctions, for when they find
you a "strangei" they "take you m " Imagine,
if you can, such an interesting cusís during tins
supposed painful suspense in tne public mind,
and think of the cruelty of the gentleman from
Ohio, [Mi Duntcan,] who, contumaciously and
rudely, witnout introduction or welcome, comes
forwaid, armed, too, wita the records of the Gov
eminent, and, without preljde or apology, tel s
the whole story, backed by the record by *,iuh
the mist is dispelled, and everyh ng put back
whe>e it was before Yes, he had the audacity
to afiiim, and to prove it, also, that the "losses
were fewer, and less in amount, during the Ad-
ministration of General Jacltso'i,and this Admin-
istration, so far as it had progressed, by more
than one half, than the aveiage losses of all the
preceding Administrations, although the collec-
tions and disbuisements were more than double,
and that the heaviest losses sustained by both the
late and present Administrations, were owing to
the '"allures of banks and meichants "
He showed you that upwards of §6,000 000 had
been lost to the Government by banns p'ior to
President Jackson's, te"-m ot serv.ee, that of this
amount theie wis lost by depreciation of bank
piper, under Mr Madison's, administration,
$>,000,000, that 5,800.000 was lost by banks un-
dei Mr Monroe's,, $270 000 undei Mr Adams's,
and §42,0110 under General Jackson's administ.a-
tions This s atement of the honoraule gentle-
man, so far fiom being extiavagant, is, m fact,
short of the leal amount lost on this account In
a lettei of the Secretary to an honoiable Senator
in the other end of the Capitol, during last ses-
sion, in answer to an inquiry made respecting this
subject, he say, in speaking of the amount lost
by banks, "that near $1,076,000 stands against
' old bank depositories The loss to the Treasury
1 by taking depreciated notes in 1814-'15-'16-'17,
' is estimated at quite $5,500,000, and there is now
' on hand, of such notes then received, and never
' piidaway crcoiiected,about$80,000moie " He
also speaks of large probable losses by the late de-
posit banks, including depreciation of their paper.
The gentleman from Ohio showed you that
$1,028,000 had been lost by collectors of duties,
including marshals and attorneys, since the com-
mencement of the Government, £,60,000 of which
only was lost undei President Jackson
That of $403,000 lost by receivers for public
lands, $200,000 occuned since Genera! Jackson
came into power, which, though equal m amount
to what was lost before, is, nevei theless, one hun-
dred per cent less, when you recui to the fact
that twice as much land has been sold since the
4th of March, 1829, as was sold previous to that
time.
That of §6,500,000 lost upon merchant's bonds,
$6,000,000 were lost pievious to the 4th of Match,
1829, and that of the remaining §500,000, part
was lost upon bonds falling due subsequent to that
date, but which were executed previous to that
time, and for which the Administration was not
responsible By turning to Senate document INfo
503, you will there find a list of forfeited upaid
duty bonds to the number of many thousand,
with the name of each delinquent, and the amount
lost on each bond The money lost on the bonds
of a single man, [Edward Thompson,) nearly all
of which were execu'ed in 1825, after Mr Adams
came into power, amounts to nearly $700,000 I
do not mention this to cast any refiectio i on his
administration, which may not have been any
more to blame than any othei creditor of an ¡n
solvent, it being more tire misfortune oí the Gov
eminent than the fault of the President Yet the
unreasonable attempt is made to hold the late and
present Administraron responsible for all such
cases The whole "sumwhicn will bee\enUal'y
lost" on these bonds, says the Secietary of the
Tieasury, " will not vary much from $6,500,000 '
It seems there were some two thousand three
hundied defaulting disbursing officers prior to the
commencement of President Jackson's first teim
of service, and some forty more dur.ng his Ad-
ministration. That by these officers the Govern-
ment lost upwards of §4,100 000, previous to the
above term, and about $100,000 during its contin-
uance The whole amount lost since 1789, 13
upwards of $18,000,000, a comparatively small
portion of which was lost under General Jackson's
administration With all these facts scaring us
full in the face, let me now ask you, sir, what be-
comes of the question asked by my col engue [Mi
Underwood] the other day—why wa  it, that as
honest men cou d not be, or wcie not, selected
during the last and present \dmimatraiJons, to fi 1
the Government offices, as did fill them under the
former Administrations—a ques u n,su, which he
asked with gieat ippa'en,. confi lence.and asres.d-
ilyairwe edit him elf with ¿jreai felicity and se t-
compiac.ioy, foi wl ich a I know my aUe a d
worthy colleague, whom I much esteem, f \ery
remaikable   Why was it that my colleague tsked
such a question, when it was not possible for it to
be sustained by facts? It was, sir, because the
very great and numerous labors of that gentleman
had prevented him from looking into the facts, and
he was like many others, led away by the cry of
fire, file, when there was no fire Sir, 1 am only
aston.shed, as every unbiased man must be, on
examination of the facts, that the amount of
money lost since the commencement of the first
term of President Jackson is not much greater.
Ceitainly the hazards and responsibilities of his
Administration were much greater than those of
previous Administrations The unparalleled ex-
tension of out teintory,and the immense quantity
of public lands biought into market, greatly mul-
tiplied the number of receivers and other officers.
The same is true in reference to officers of the cus-
toms The unparalleled increase of our tonnage,
from one to two millions m nine yeais, la proof of
this Butthegreatiiicreasemtheamountot money
which has passed through the hands of our officers
is conclusive The largest amount of money re
ceived for public lands, daring any one yeai of
Mr Adams's administration,is $1,495,845. The
amount received on the same account in 1836, la
$24,877,179 The largest amount of revenue re-
ceived any one y ear preceding 1829, is $24,844,000
The amount received in 1836, is $50,826 000 Add
to this the unheard of increase of bank note circula-
tion, which rose to $140,000,000, the large amount
of public money on hand, which was at one time
upwards of $50,000,000, the general extravagance
and wastefulness which pervaded every section of
the country, and every rank of society, and the
madness of speculation with which the times were
ominous, and what living, honest, unbiased man,
is not surprised that the loss of public money falls
so far short of corresponding losses in preceding
years '
By the general suspension of specie payments
many public officers became defaulters to the Gov-
ernment for the time being The banks to the
amount of more than $20,000,000 The Govern
ment had to give them time, in consequence of
which the ultimate payment of mostof the money
was secured The respective sums due by most
of the defaulting officers have also been secured
The defalcations were not such as ordinarily occur.
They were the unavoidable offspring of the un-
usual and extraoidinary times that produced them.
This must be clear to every discriminating mind
that is not blinded by prejudice The genera!
revulsion was an untoward and unprecedented
storm, which upset the whole monetary system,
which carried with it in its fall " the beggar and
the king," the citizen and the corporation None
were exempt, whether natural or artificial persons
Even the Government had to share m the genera!
discomfi'ure, which was deep and wide as the
commerce of the worl t Amid the disastersof the
times, which spaied neither the Government, the
banks, oi the people, were all the nnmeious col-
lecting:, receiving, and disbuismg officers of the
Government to escape? Who expected that such
would be the case? Nobody if not, does it fur-
nish any evidence of dishonesty or corruption in
the Adrnimstiation? Certainly not Where, then,
is the soothing voice of charity, even of justice,
that would not visit the penalties of guilt upon
the innocent? Alas' for our blindness to ourfiail-
ties ' We forget to " first cast the beam out of our
own eye," that we may ' see clearly to cast the
mote out of our brothel 'a "
But when the general consternation occasioned
by the suspension passed by, and confidence re-
sumed her wonted place in the community, all
interests began to right themselves. The default-
ing banks seemed most of their balances, and so
did most receivers and collectors There had been
little destruction of means A su-pei,6ion of busi-
ness constituted thegeneial..Miction, which passed
