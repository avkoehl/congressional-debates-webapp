Davis, Brookfield (severely wounded), Taylor, and Haywood; Color-Sergeant Grimstead, wounded, and Privates Noah McDaniel, who captured 7 prisoners and John Trotman.

Colonel Wade, Twelfth North Carolina, mentions the good conduct of Lieutenant Plummer, Company C, and Private T. L. Emory, Company G.

My personal staff during these engagements consisted of Captain Charles Wood, assistant adjutant-general, and Lieuts. R. D. Early and F. M. Haywood, jr., the last at Malvern Hill only. I can most sincerely testify to their gallantry and intelligence. Lieutenant Early was severely wounded and Captain Wood had his horse instantly killed under him by a solid shot.

I present a succinct statement of killed and wounded and file lists of the same by name.

I have the honor to subscribe myself, major, your obedient servant,

S. GARLAND, JR.

Brigadier General Commanding Third Brigade, Third Division.

Major RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
