Brigadier General W. A. HAMMOND,

Surgeon-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.

SIR: At the request of Lieutenant Colonel W. H. Ludlow, agent for exchange of prisoners, I inclose to you a list* of U. S. officers and soldiers together with a few citizens who have died while held as prisoners within the lines and in the hospitals of the rebel army. On examination of the list some repetitions of names are found to occur probably to the number of ten or twelve.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., February 24, 1863.

Colonel G. DE KORPONAY,

Commanding Camp Banks, Alexandria, Va.

COLONEL: The paroled and exchanged troops belonging to regiments serving in the West will be sent out to Western camps from Camp Parole, Annapolis, in a few days, and you will please send to that camp any men at Camp Banks belonging to such regiments to be joined to those going West. Let this be done at once and send full rolls with them. Your weekly report of the 20th instant shows upwards of 400 exchanged troops still at the camp. Please explain what it is that detains them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, D. C., February 24, 1863.

Captain E. L. WEBBER,

Commanding Camp Chase Prison, Columbus, Ohio.

CAPTAIN: Yours of the 5th instant with the accompanying papers has been received. Your arrangements for the accommodation of prisoners of war are satisfactory. It will scarcely be possible to provide for the female prisoners sent to you by General Rosecrans at the camp and if you find it necessary and can do so you will place them in the jail in Columbus making the best terms or their keeping you can. You can issue them rations at the jail if it is advisable.

In reply to your letter of the 6th instant I have to say that all instructions given to your predecessor are still in force and are for your guidance. I am not informed of the particular instructions given to Judge Galloway but until other orders are given by the Secretary of War you will of course recognize his position. Order 193 applies only to prisoners held at its date and so far as they are concerned its execution was left in the hands of the commanding officer. Those arrested since that date can only be released by authority of the Secretary of War. No recommendations from Judge Galloway have come to me
