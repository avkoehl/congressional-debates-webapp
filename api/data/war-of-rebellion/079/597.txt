ROME, November 2, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Kingston, Ga.:

General Howard reports last night at 6. 30 at Cedartown and nicely in camp; says Hood took much, but plenty corn and some pigs are left. Some scouting and observing parties of the enemy's cavalry about him. A captured letter from a citizen to Governor Brown complains bitterly of Hood's army and its lawlessness, and begs him to get orders from Jeff. Davis to stop it.
