In assessing the value of first-class artillery and wagon horses and mules at $800, we designed that the terms should be accepted and acted upon according to its obvious common sense import. In other words, that they should be selected and then impressed, accordingly as their working qualities and adaptation to army service, together with their intrinsic value, would warrant a judicious purchaser in considering them as coming within the contemplation of the commissioners when they assessed the average value of such horses as the Government needed at $800. But cases might arise, however, when the public exigencies would be so urgent as to demand that all horses at hand should be impressed; yet, under ordinary circumstances, when family or extra blooded horses or brood mares of admitted high value are impressed, we respectfully suggest to the Secretary of War to have instructions forwarded to the impressing officers to propose and allow the owners to substitute in their stead such strong, sound, and serviceable horses or mules as shall be considered and valued by competent and disinterested parties as first-class artillery horses or first-class wagon mules.

The term average value per head is in contradistinction to a fixed and uniform price for each horse or mule. We suppose that in impressing a number of horses or mules, whether owned by several persons or one individual, that some might be estimated at $600, and others at different advanced rates, according to their worth, up as high as $1,000, thus making an average value or price for a number of good, sound, and efficient horses or mules $800 each.

In illustration of our views we will add, that a horse with only one eye sound might, in all other respects, be classed as a first-class artillery horse, yet the loss of one eye would justly and considerably curtail his value. So a horse from ten to eighteen years of age might be deemed in all other particulars as a first-class artillery horse, but, of course, however efficient and able to render good service for a year or two, yet his advanced age would justly and materially impair his value. Any horse, however he may approximate the standard of a first-class artillery horse, must, according to deficiency, fall below the maximum price, and as few, comparatively, come up to the standard, and are therefore entitled to the maximum price, so, of course, in all other instances the price should be proportionately reduced as imperfections place them below the standard of first-class, &amp; c.

The first quality of sorghum molasses is of the consistency of honey and free from all acidity to the taste; but second and inferior qualities of molasses should be reduced in price from 10 to 20 per cent. accordingly as they shall fall below the standard of first quality.
