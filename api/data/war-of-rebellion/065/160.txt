the lesson of to-day, but the men are exhausted. Yates says that Commander Tucker can send some men to Fort Johnson. Please ask it and send them. There are now in Stono, out of range of our batteries, and firing on us, two monitors and seven gun-boats, including the Pawnee. They will, with this support, hold on. Would like a Brooke gun at Pringle, and the torpedo-boat should certainly go down to-night.

I require a large force here. The shelling of pickets is terrible. I wish the general to see this particularly. I don't think enemy will try Sullivan's Island after the affair at Johnson's. My picket force has to be largely increased if the monitors and gun-boats [sic]. The men are worn out and exhausted.

BATTERY Numbers 2., July 4, 1864.-6 a. m.

All quiet this morning. The enemy threw mortar shells at works and pickets at intervals of five minutes during the night, with occasional rifle-shots and a few shots from monitors. There was some picket skirmishing all night. Barges were reconnoitering in rear of Pawnee, and other gun-boats and transports in Stono; the first abreast of our picket-line. They will, I presume, repeat the severe shelling of yesterday, by which, however, no one was hurt.

The enemy's line of skirmishers extends from old Stono house on peninsula at Grimball's Causeway. I would drive them off, as I think it likely they have retired much of their force, but the monitors and gun-boats so completely command the peninsula that I will wait developments. The torpedo-boat did not come down. Something must be done to expel the vessels, or the number of troops will have to be much increased, as they cannot stand the night and day annoyance of the shelling. They command all parts of our lines. It is very important to have a Brooke gun at Brooke gun at Pringle, and a 10-inch columbiad at Numbers 1. Please send them at once if possible.

I estimate that the enemy's loss has been at least 300 killed and wounded on this front, which is less than the estimate of prisoners. Our loss, 1 captured, 2 killed by premature discharge of one of our own guns, and 5 wounded. Colonel Yates captured, killed, and wounded 300 men, losing 4 wounded, 2 mortally. This makes operations in this district for the last two days foot up: Yankee loss, 600; Confederate loss, 11 men and 2 light guns.

It is erroneous, as stated in the papers, that the section with was lost had no support. It hade a small support, and was lost by the
