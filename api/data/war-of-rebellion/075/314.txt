Brigadier-General GARRARD,

Commanding Second Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The enemy had evidently massed his available strength in and about Dallas, and we may expect a heavy battle to-morrow. Hold your cavalry well in hand near your present headquarters, Adair's Court-House, to cover our right flank, and be ready for any movement. Hardee's corps is in front of us. Thomas has been fighting Hood's corps this afternoon; result not known, as I have not heard our left flank and might remain there. No trains will cross Pumpkin Vine Creek, except ammunition trains and ambulances, until further orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
