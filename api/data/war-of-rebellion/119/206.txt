AUGUSTA, August 15, 1863.

President LINCOLN, Washington:

DEAR SIR: We are greatly alarmed for the safety of General Dow, whom the rebels have taken to Mobile on a charge of stealing negroes. You have been advised of the facts in his case. It is not possible in some way, by proclamation or otherwise, to admonish them of the dangers they will encounter by dealing thus with an officer of the U. S. Army?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LOT M. MORRILL.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, D. C., August 15, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Cincinnati, Ohio:

SIR: The Secretary of War has in preparation an order on the subject of the discharge of prisoners, and he desires that no discharges shall be made under your orders (Numbers 126) of the 8th instant. * You will soon receive a War Department order on the subject.

E. A. HITCHCOCK,

Major General of Vols. and Commissioner for Exchange of Prisoners.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SAINT MARY'S,Point Lookout, August 15, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

COLONEL: On or about the 10th instant I wrote you that I should be ready to receive 1,000 prisoners as soon as you could send them. None have since arrived. All the arrangements of mess-houses, &amp;c., have not been completed, but nevertheless prisoners can be taken care of here with perfect ease and safety. If the Government chooses to send them here I am ready to receive them.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GILMAN MARSTON,

Brigadier-General.

CHICAGO, August 15, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN:

I have just learned that you have been told that Camp Douglas would accommodate 8,000. This is an error. Six thousand, including guard, is the utmost limit, and then they will be crowded. Please have a commandant sent; also a good officer.

J. A. POTTER,

Assistant Quartermaster.

GAINESVILLE, August 15, 1863.

Major-General STEVENSON, Demopolis, Ala.:

The following just received from the President:

RICHMOND, August 14, 1863.

General J. C. PEMBERTON, Gainesville, Miss.:

To use arms for the purposes of instruction and to maintain discipline in camp of paroled men does not come within any restriction of cartel. The terms of your capitulation must be referred to find whether there be other objection.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

I see nothing in the terms of capitulation to prohibit this.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General.
