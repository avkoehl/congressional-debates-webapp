APPENDIX D.

CINCINNATI, December 5, 1861.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL, Commanding Dept. of the Ohio, Louisville, Ky.:

GENERAL: Since my report to General Mitchel of November 1 a copy of which is herewith presented, I have expended most of the small balance in my hands in providing quarters, sentry-boxes, &amp;c., for the guards, improving the interior of the batteries, and adding a small redan and battery to Fort Mitchel. This battery is not finished for want of money. A copy of the map delivered to General Mitchel is hereto attached, the original being at Washington. A separate plan of Fort Mitchel is also herewith. This work was laid out and constructed in great haste, intended at first for artillery; but failing to obtain the requisite guns the bastions were changed to breastworks for infantry, with banquets. A half ditch was made with a vertical counterscarp; depth 7 to 8 feet; surface breadth 11 feet; breath of bottom 4 feet; no bend. Slopes are 1 to 1, the earth being capable of that high angle. The interior revetment is of plank. An abatis of the honey or thorny locust placed along the northern front, intended to be carried around the work on the outer edge of the ditch. About 2 feet is to be taken off the natural surface on the west between the curtain and the four-gun battery, which goes to complete this battery and improve the ground on that side.

It did not seem to me necessary to construct plans of the batteries, which are simple earthworks sunk into the surface, with stone or plank revetments.

A schedule of guns and other property connected with the battery accompanies this paper; also my account with General Mitchel. It requires at least one maximum infantry company to guard the property. With the exception of those on the Cincinnati side these works are now guarded by detachments from my regiment, relieved every three days.

I shall continue this duty and the general supervision of the battery till further orders.
