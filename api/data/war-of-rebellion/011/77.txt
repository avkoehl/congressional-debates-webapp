to Cairo immediately. General Halleck has ordered all the heavy guns from Donelson and Fort Henry, but they are not enough to make the position strong against land and water attack.

THOMAS A. SCOTT,

Assistant Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, March 29, 1862.

General BUELL, Columbia:

There is no danger of the enemy's moving in the direction of Nashville from Decatur or Stevenson. I wish he would. I wish you to concentrate everything possible against the enemy's center. Don't fail in this, as it is all-important to have an overwhelming force there. You will find provisions and forage.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, March 29, 1862.

General BUELL, Columbia:

It seems from all accounts that the enemy is massing his forces in the vicinity of Corinth. You will concentrate all your available troops at Savannah, or Pittsburg, 12 miles above. Large re-enforcements are being sent to General Grant. We must be ready to attack the enemy as soon as the roads are passable.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

COLUMBIA, TENN., March 29, 1862 (via Nashville.)

Major-General HALLECK:

Your dispatch of the 28th received. We will waste no time. I rely on finding provisions and forage at the river. Am taking only enough to last us that far.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, March 29, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Saint Louis:

Steam-rams are rapidly being prepared under the direction of Engineer Ellet at Pittsburg, and he proceeds immediately to Cincinnati to fit up some there. They are the most powerful steamboats, with upper cabins removed, bows filled in with heavy timber. It is not proposed to wait for putting on iron. This is the mode in which the Merrimac will be met. Can you not have something of the kind speedily prepared at Saint Louis also?

EDWIN M. STANTON

Secretary of War.
