i It will be seen that the payments for balanifc
due on Our postal accounts with foreign countries
were greater in 1855 than in the previous year.
The following statement will explain:
The whole amount of balances paid to Great
Britain and Bremen in 18*55, was $316,325 11.
In this sum is included the following amount
of balances, which had accrued to Great Britain
and 'Bremen respectively,prior to 1st July, 1854,
to wit: ,
Balances in favor of Great Britain for the 2d, 3d, and 4th
quarters of 1853, and the 1st and 2d quarters of 1854, paid

expended for " compensation to postmasters"
and " clerks for offices" in' 1854, Was 38 26-100
per cent. Allowing the same rate upon the
revenue of ] 855, the expenditure for those objects
would be $2,476,454 26, instead of 03,837,95& 62;
and, after deducting the sum of$45,000, estimated
for the relief of special cases, there is still an in-
crease of expenditure over 1854 of $316,498 36,
resulting from the operation of the act of June
22,1854
0243,724 47
The expenditures for transportation have very
much increased during the last year, and a prin-
cipal cause of this increase is owing to the very
great extension of railroad service. In the past
year there has be'en 3,1574 miles of "new railroad
added to the mail service in various parts of the
country, at a rate of annual cost, as it stood on
the 30th June last, of $286,636. Some of these
routes are Very important, and traverse sections
of country in which the cost of old service taken
up was very inconsiderable.
In connection with this branch of the Subject it
may be well to state, that while the increase of
revenue in 1854 over that of the year preceding
was 18 85-100 per cent., the increase of the year
ending June 30, 1855, over that of the year end-
ing .Tunc 30,1854, was but 7 3-5per cent., caused, ■
no doubt, in some degree, by the commercial :
inactivity of the last year. These three causes i
have contributed very much to increase the defi- 1
ciency of the past year.
, Every annual statement of the expenditures of
a department having such a vast number of ac-
counts as the General Post Office, must necessa-
rily embrace manywhich should have been settled
and paid in previous years; but, taking one year
with another, the amount of such items has been
so nearly equal, that particular reference has rarely
been made to them. In the past year, however,
so manypAym^rtshave been made by authority
of special acts of Coa^fess, that a statement of
them is deemed proper.
The account of transportation is charged with
the following sums, to wit:

Pursuant to the act for the relief of Daniel
Searle & Co., approved March 2,1855, there was
drawn from the Treasury and paid to them, for
services rendered under a contract made in 1835
the sum of $4,695 66, which is also charged to
transportation in 1855. °
The expenditures for mail depredations and
$ Sunts.rcreincreased, in 1855, by the sum

"L-w „g5ln'late sPecial agent in California, for

Such is the condition of the revenue of the
Department' for the year 1855, which goes further
to show that the rates fixed by . the act of 3d
March, 1851, will not ertable the Department to
sustain itself frdm its revenue's. This must
be the '-case for somc years, and large annual ap-
propriations must continue to be drawn from tho
Treasury.
Although this, in my opinion, is deeply to be
regretted, it has been, ana shall continue to be,
my effort to confine its Expenditures, as nearly as
practicable, within its income. In no department
of the Government is greater care required in the
expenditure of money, and if once the doctrine
be established that it is a charge upon the Treas-
ury, less care and vigilance will be exercised,
moneys will be uselessly expended in supplying
imaginary "wants, and abuses of every description
; will be generated.
! When regarding the deficiency in the Post Of-
fice revenue, there are two matters which stand
prominently oat and demand our consideration;
' and the first is the franking privilege. When the
subject of the reduction of postage was before the
British Parliament, it was discovered that, out of
the number of 62,000,000 or 64,000,000 of letters
which passed annually through the General Post1
Office of that country, 7,000,000, or about g. ninth 1
part of the whole, were franked—and this under
a franking privilege which limited members of , I
Parliament to ten letters or packets to be sent, j
jtrrd fifteen to be received, each day. When the I
act of Parliament of 1840 was passed, reducing f
the rates of postage to the uniform rate of one
penny, one of its provisions abolished the frank-
ing privilege, petitions to Parliament and parlia- 1
mentary documents only being allowed to go free.
The high rates of postage in that country pre-
vious to the passage of the act of 1840, caused the
franking privilege to be very much abused, and
no vigilance could guard against its being most
extensively used, as a vehicle for private corre-
spondence. It is, I think, to be deeply regretted i
that, on the passage of the act of 1851, similar
provisidns -Were not incorporated into that act.
* c?titnry So .wide and extended as ours, it
would be almost impossible to ascertain with any
degree of certainty how 'many millions of let-
ters passed through our mails, or what number
were franked. .In an account kept at the Wash- I
ington city post office during the month of Jan-
uary, 1854, it was found there were franked by
members of Confess, during that month, 77,727 i
flo^na Public documents, which weighed i
?0U? .- L ™elSht letters and doc-!
7 „ j -the Apartments amounted to '
Jy P6unds. During the same month the weight 
fn TiYTnlPet1S T frZfTOm this office amounted
,wuL <• ?oun?S- Tlie arn°unt for this month
™ sare'y taken as showing less than a fair
^Je TP y°ar; but the post-
amouritrSw m < prepaid rates on that
am ou rit of mail matter, would-be $1,468,886. The
letters and documents franked by members of
Congress when absent from the seat of Govem-
^ave not been estimated, but the number j
Ze iesixlLaCrSiderlbIe- iTwo h«"dred and I
nety six tsenators and members and seven del-
3 • •. ^an°us acts on this subject the
privilege of a Member and Senatorelect
commences from the 4th of March previous to the
first Monday of December when the Congress to
which he has been electcd shall assemble. The
Scn'atdrs and Members whose terms have expired
! continue to exercise this privilege until the next
1 Congress assembles; so that, between March and
December of the present year, four hundred and
nine Senators and Members and delegates were
using the franking privilege in every part of the
country. If the letters and documents thus
franked Were limited to the public service, the
evil would not be as great as it now is; but, low
as are the present rates of postage, the frank
covers private correspondence of every descrip-
tion, and abstracts largely from the Treasury.
The Department not only carries all this matter
free of charge, but likewise pays to every post-
master whose yearly commissions do not amount
to the sum of #2.000, one cent for the delivery of
each letter. Though the free matter passing
through the mails is very large at the present
time, the amount of it is yearly increasing. The
weight and numfeer of public documents add very
much to the cost of transportation, and, when
not conveyed by railroad, retard the mail. The
directors of the various railroad companies, when
required to reduce their charges, point to the mail
matter conveyed by them, amounting in some in-
stances to tons, ana insist that they do not receive
as miich for it as for ordinary frieght. Although
this assumption is, in my opinion, most un-
founded, it affords a pretext to some of them for
demanding the present enormous rates. In ad-
dition to this, the quantity of free, joined to the
printed matter, to which I shall presently allude,
obliges the Department to contract for a higher
grade of service than the Ordinary mails would
require, and two and four-horse coach service
have to be substituted for horseback, at greatly
increased rates, and has, in effect, rendered in-
operative the eighteenth section of the act of 3d
of March, 1845, which was intended to reduce
the Cost of transportation by requiring the Post-
master Genera] to select such modes as might be
necessary to provide for the due celerity, cer- •
tainty, and security of such transportation, with-
l oujtTeference to any other consideration.
| The second subject to which I shall ask your
j attention when considering the deficiency in the
j Fost Office relates to the rates on printed matter.
| In my last annual report, I deemed it my duty to
, recommend that the act of 30th August, 1852, be
; modified by repealing the clause therein which
provides that " when the postage on any news-
: paper or periodical is paid quarterly or yearly in
advance, one half only of the regular rates shall
be charged The effect of this will be to secure
from this class of printed matter the full, regular
rates established by that law. For instance: on
a single newspaper or periodical n'dt weighing
over one ounce and a half, when circulated Tn the
tetate where published, the postage will be half a
cent; and when not over three ounces in weight,
sent to any part of the United States, one tent
each; whereas, under the Operation of the pres-
ent law, on all publications for which postage is
paid quarterly or yearly in advance, one half
0f,7 18 roa'*zcd—namely, one quarter
cent each in the one case and one half cent in the
other. It will not affect any other class of mat-

fully the importance attached to the ffeneral dit? '

periodical press, I cannot avoid the convTtion in
view of the great and increasing bulk. aTd of d "

the present deduction of fifty per cent for ad- "
