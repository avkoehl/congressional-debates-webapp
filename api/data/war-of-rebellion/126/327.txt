During the fiscal year I transmitted to the Quartermaster- General's Office reports of seventeen inspections and investigations, and since the 1st of July, 1865, have added thirty-two to that number-in all, forty-nine.

These inspections and investigations have been made in the Northern Department in Kansas, Missouri, and in the Department of the East.***

In addition ot the inspectors regularly assigned, and whose duties have been briefly stated above, other officers, of the Quartermaster's Department have been temporarily assigned to inspection duty as the necessities of the service required. Particularly since active operations have ceased it has been necessary to call into requisition the service of such, and in many cases the results have been highly satisfactory and productive, of the greatest good in connection with the retrenchment, and reduction of force and expense.
