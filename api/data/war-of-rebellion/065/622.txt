Brigadier General H. W. MERCER,

Savannah, Ga.:

If the company of the siege train can go without delaying the movement of the Eighteenth South Carolina Volunteers, the Eleventh South Carolina Volunteers, and the Fifty-ninth Virginia Volunteers ordered from South Carolina to Florida, you can send it well supplied to Brigadier-General Finegan at Lake City. Otherwise it must remain until the troops from South Carolina are pushed through.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

CHARLESTON, February 21, 1864.

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

This morning's telegram* may not have answered fully yours of yesterday. I consider an able officer of sufficient rank indispensable to success in Florida. Should you send one abler than General Taliaferro he will be very acceptable.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

FEBRUARY 22, 1864.

It may not be improper to add that General Beauregard's commendations of General Taliaferro have been elicited by no reference to him in my telegram, which referred simply to Major-General
