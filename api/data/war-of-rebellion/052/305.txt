HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,September 2, 1863-10 a.m.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Jasper:

The general commanding directs you to send a brigade to the crossing at Jasper and one at the crossing at Battle Creek, and cross them over as soon as the way is clear. Let your other brigades rest in camp, and be ready to cross as soon as the way is open. Send your trains under efficient officers to the vicinity of Bridgeport, where they will cross as soon as the road is open. Go over yourself or send General Palmer to locate your command on the other side of the river in a good position to the left or rear of General Reynolds, and close your train in on the right and rear of your troops. See that roads are opened for the free movement of your trains and artillery on the other side. Effect the crossing as rapidly as possible. Where are your wagons that were sent to McMinnville? Are they safe, and when will they be in? How many days' rations have you? The other two corps have arranged to carry twenty-four days' rations.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS:

GENERAL: I send you a communication just received from General Wood. It seems to me it is the very thing we should desire. If Bragg should make a dash at Burnside and Burnside retire slowly, declining to fight, I think we can destroy his (Bragg's) army.
