Brigadier General W. H. EMORY,

New Orleans:

GENERAL: If the gunboat is at Brashear, the two companies that went there can escape on her. What became of the guns at Brashear? The commanding general directs me to inform you that it is impossible for him to spare any force from here at present. He relies upon your doing the best you can with the small force at your disposal.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Commanding Officer of military and naval forces at Donaldsonville:

The enemy, in considerable force, has crossed the Plaquemine at Indian Village, and passed down the La Fourche, to attack the Opelousas Railroad and Brashear City.

I do not think Donaldsonville in any immediate danger. What force can be spared should be sent down to Algiers, to be placed on the railroad.

Communicate this to Admiral Farragut.

We have been attacked. We have repulsed them once. We do not know where they will appear again.
