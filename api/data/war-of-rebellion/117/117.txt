OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, July 2, 1862.

Major W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot of Prisoners, Sandusky City, Ohio.

MAJOR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your communication of the 27th ultimo inclosing the petition of Captain Handy. In reply I have to inform you that as he has been reported and is borne upon the rolls of this office as captain it cannot be here regarded that his rank in the rebel service is any other, and that before an application for his release can be considered it will be necessary that the claim to the position of surgeon asserted by him as his legitimate rank be fully established.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Major W. S. PIERSON,

Commanding Depot of Prisoners of War, Sandusky, Ohio.

MAJOR: All the prisoners under your charge are prisoners of war, some military and some civilians. In making up the roll for citizens under the heading, rank, regiment and company enter the town, county and State from which the prisoner comes. Your letter of the 30th ultimo is signed for you by your adjutant which is contrary to regulations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Detroit, July 2, 1862.

Major JOSEPH DARR, Jr.,

Provost-Marshal-General, Wheeling, Va.

MAJOR: Your letters of the 28th and 29th ultimo with their inclosures have been received. I judge from your letter of the 28th that there [are]a number of stations in your department where prisoners are held, civil and military, and I will be obliged to your if you will consolidate in your office the rolls and returns of all these stations. I refer to those south of the Ohio. The civil prisoners should be on separate rolls from the military and I wish the alphabetical list to be as comprehensive as possible, being at the same [time] in convenient shape for reference. The names of all those who come under the head of alterations on the return should accompany the monthly return unless a list of prisoners transferred, &amp;c., has been furnished during the month, in which case a reference to it must be made on the blanks let me know and they will be furnished. I expect to be in Columbus in a few days and will telegraph to you to meet me there.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.
