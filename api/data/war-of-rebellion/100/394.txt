probably leave for City Point to-morrow, and will be obliged for any further details before starting. I will write you fully from City Point, but probably will not have occasion to make any more orders.

Major-General.

RALEIGH, N. C., May 4, 1865.

Major-General HALLECK:

I have received your dispatch of the 3rd. I returned last night from Greensborugh, where I went to have a final interview with General Johnston. Everything is progressing satisfactorily. The delivery of arms and paroling of Johnston's army is conlcuded, and they have started for their homes. I will be able to make full reports in a few days. The country is a good deal distrubed by the returned soldiers from bothe Lee's and Johnston's armies, but I think it can be reduced to order in a short time.

A number of officers and men of bothe Lee's and Johnston's armies, whose homes are in the Western States, desire to pass through the Northern States to their homes. Can they be permitted to do so? Can transportation be furnished in any case?

General Sherman having relinquished command of North Carolina, that State comes within this military division.
