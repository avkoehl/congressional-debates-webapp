do, pa's over the Sulfílete n bar at the lowest
stage of wale-, thereby extending active faculties
10 the contmrrce cari ej on up hi that river I
have thought it my duty to say thus much m
relation to what has come under my own obser
vation
Mr EWING maintained that it was not the
West alone that was lnteiested in this improve-
ment, but the South was equally so, and every
section of tut Union was more oriels so It was,
in his opinion, a perversion of the Constitution to
oppose the appropriation of the people's money
for the people's good Mr L proposed to amend
the amendir er t, by inserting; at the end of it, " for
improving me Wabasn §25 000 "
Mi HUBBARD submitted whether the amend-
ment was in order, a bill having been reported"
piovidmg for the same object
Mr E WING said the bill was not the same as
his amendment, for it piovided for a different
an ount, ^20,000
The CrillR decided the amendment out of
older, on the grounds set forth by Mr Hubbard
Mr STE W ART, of Pennsylvania, produced a
letter from Captain Shrieve, covering a statement
of the expenses of thepioposed improvement, with
his opinion of its propriety and expediency, &c ,
which was read by the Clerk, and Mr S supported
the amendment at some length
Mi CHILTON hoped the discussion would
be brought to an end, for this question had been
argued so frequently, from session to session, that
ail must be well versed in it
Mr BURD hoped the House would not draw
rn invidious distinction, by rejecting so small an
appropi lation for this part of the Ohio nvei, while
bo many nundreds of thousands were expended
elsewhere He believed the object within the
intent and meaning of the Constitution, for the
mean3 of the coun"y could be devoted to noooject
more national than that of improving its rivers,
which   vere the ve ns and ai tenes of the country
Mi ÍIAWES gave an explanation with refer
ence to his votes at last session He added that
the communication of the engineer confirmed him
in his opinion that the appropriation was nnneces
eary, and if made would be endless If $20,000
were expended, it would necessarily involve an
expenditure of $40 000, and as soon as §40,000
were expended, $80 000 more would be required,
and- so it would go on He believed moie harm
than good would ensue, and he would never give
his vote for destroying the navigation of this beau
tifiil river
Mr LYTLE airam addressed the committee m
favor of the a nendrrent, and maintained that its
character was pecu ia>dy national, and was scarce-
ly equalled in point of importance If, howevei,
the issue was to be made of opposing all appro-
pria ions for improvements in the West, Mr L
should oppose equally those in other sections of
ihe country, which weie not more national than
the one now under consideration
Mr W7H1TTLESCY, of Ohio, said a few
woids on the same subject
Mi H^RDIJN was as solici'ous as any gen-
tleman could be for the improvement of the Ohio
r ver, provided it was productive of benefit, but
he was still convinced that the removal of the
bars would do, as it had done heretofore, harm
When one bar was removed, generally a worse
one wis foimed instead of it Mr H contended
that the West had no light to comrla'n By the
compact thiee peí cent of the produce oí the
public lands in Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois, were
to be exnended m m'ernal impiovemen's, but if
the whole of the land within the (uangle foimed
by those th'ee States were sold at the full Drice
of a dollar and a quaiter an acie, it would barely
make one third of the amount abeady expended
theieupon the Cumberland road Mr H entered
into an ex ilanatiou with ¡eference to his course
on the Portland and Louisville canal He had
voted to take up the subject, but he explained the
difficu'ties he was under, whether he should vote
foi it or not to one of his colleagues, and had he
been present when the vote was taken, he in-
tended to have asked leave to be excused fi om
voting
Mr JOEINSON, of Louisiana, referred to a
survey made for the improvement of the mouth
of the Mississippi, and thought the amount con-
templated in tne amendment might, wnh more
propriety, be devoted to the subject
M. VINTON oe-ired the clerk to read the
concluding part of Captain Shrieve's letter, to
show the importance of the improvement
Mr HUBBARD little thought the bid would
have brought up such a discussion He would
?PPeal to the gentleman from Tennessee himself
[Mr Dickinson] to say if there was anything con
stitutionally objectionable in it Of the $,300,000
appropriated in the bill,$60,000 were for western
I harbors, and the amount for new entries did not
exceed $20,000 It moreover contained already
§50,000 for the Ohio, Mississippi, and Missoun
It had been argued in favo, Oí the amendment
that the Committee on Roads and Canais, weie for
it, why, then, had they not reported a bill for the
purpose' The Committee of Ways and Means
could not be expected to do it He denied that
the bill was exclusively foi the benefit of the sea-
board, for it only appropriated §17,000 for New
I England He hoped the bill would be reported
as it stood
Mr DICKINSON, of Tennessee, again reit-
eiated his objections to the bill
Mr SUTHERLAND rose to urge the friends
of the bill not to debate it, but to act, if they did
I not wish to kill it    He referred to several bills
which he  was desirous of bringing before the
committee,involving no constitutional difficulties
¡     The question was then taken, and the amend-
I ment was agreed to—yeas 79, nays 54

pi latmg for the protection and securing Flat Beach,
alias Tucker\ Island, Little Egg Haibor, New
Jersey, §5 695 40, and sent to tr-e Clerk-s table a
report of tne engineer thereon
Mi SUTHERLAND objected to the amend
ment on the principle that it was for anew work,
and was now before the Committee on Commerce,
to whom it had been referred by a resolution
introduced by the gentleman fiom New Jersey
himself
The amendment was rejected
Mr BE VTFY moved an item of §25,000 for
improving the navigation of the Cumberland r vei
I Mr B made a brief explaration in favor of t"e
proposed appropi iat,on, and said that he had been
informed at the War Department, that the report
of the engineer on the subject would be sent to
■the House to morrow The vicinity of the river
contained bituminous coal, iron, copperas, and
other ore, sufficient to supply the whole continent,
all of which were now lying useless for want of
improving the navigation of the Cumbeiland
nvei
The amendment was rejected—ayes 49, noes
not counted
Mr WATMOUGH proposed an item of
§7,000 to lemove the bar at the mouth of the
Schuylkill
Mi  POPE asked if there had been any sur
vev
I     Mr  WATMOUGH replied in the negative
Mr SUTHERLAND said, some four or five
years ago he had attempted to get a survey made
for this very object, and the con-mittee to wh ch
Mi S belonged intended to report a bill for that
purpose
Mr WATMOUGH asked if the gentleman
was opposed to the amendment, as Mr W wished
that fact should be known elsewhere as well as in
that House
Mr SUTHERLAND again explained The
subject was under consideration by the committee
of which Mi S was a member, and would be
reported upon in the present session

vision

inserting a piovision for the appointment of a
surveyor genera! for Indiana, to reside at Indian-
apolis
Mi K remarked that the Committee on the
Public Lands, at the last session, were m favor of
this pioposition He did not believe that the
House would be disposed to give any advantage
to one State over another, in this particular He
urged the propriety of his amendment as pecu-
liarly propei in reference to certain constitutional
provisions of that State, prohibiting the reduction
of the s ze of any county below a given number
of squaie miles
The amer dment was disagreed to, when the bill
was then laid aside
