\RMY SERVICE BILL
The House then resumed the consideration of
the bill making appropriations for the suppoi t of
the Army of the United States foi the year 1839
The pending question was on the motion of
Mr Merclr. to amend the bill by adding to the
end theieof an appropnation of $30,000 foi the
piosecution of surveys under the act of 1824
Mi PETRIKÍN demanded the yeas and nays,
which were oidered
The main point of the debate on this pioposed
item was, whether the act of 1834 was prospective
and continuous in its operation, oi expired at the
end of the year, oi when the fir t appropriation
made by it was expended. The opposers of Mi.
Mercer's amendment insisted upon the limita-
tion, and that the law was no longer in foice;
while its supporters contended that the act was a
geneial one, and the money appiopnated under
it designed to be continued annually The fol-
lowing is the law of 1824, the second and only
other section meiely appiopnatmg §30,000 to
cany out the lequirement of the first
' lie it enacted 1 if the Senate and Mouse of Representatives
I of the bnitel States of Jlmerlcain Congress assemblel, That
! the President of the United States 1  hereby authorized to
cause the necessary surveys, pirns, and estimans, to be
made of the routes of such road  and canals as he maydpem
ot nation tl nnpoitance, in a commercial or militar) point
of vitw, or necessary for the tr importation of the public
mad, designating, in the cage of each can ll, what parts
may h made capable of sloop navigation, the suiveys,
plans, and estimate , for each, when completed, to be laid
before Gongtess "
Mi MERCER again addiessed the House at
length in support of his pioposition
Mr HOWARD moved a substitute for the
amendment, by specifying the surveys to be made,
the amount being the same
Mr HAYNES said he would mtiude but a
few moments upon the attention of the House.
He said we had heard much about the act of 1824
and its obligations upon Congress to make appro-
priations foi suiveys There was but one portion
of that act obligatory upon any one By it the
President is íequiredto present to Congress such
objects of suivey as, in his judgment, íequned its
attention Congress was left tiee, by the act re-
fened to, to appropnate, 01 not appiopnate,
money foi surveys, as, 111 its judgment, may seem
propel As had been justly obseived by his
fnend fiom South Carolina, [Mi Pickfns,] the
act of 1824 imposed on Congress no obligation to
appropnate any paiticular sum, as the appiopn-
ation of that yeai was meiely an annual appro-
priation If it had been intended to be perpetual,
that intention would have been expiessed in the
act, and fui ther annual appropriations would have
since been unnecessaiy
The gentleman fiom Virginia [Mi Mercer]
had stated to the House that, since 1824, about
two hundied and fifty thousand dollars had been
appropnated under the act referred to This
shows those appropriations had not been annu-
ally repeated, as it would only covei about eight
years of the thirteen, at the late of thirty thou-
sand dolíais per annum But he hadnsen merely
to ask the House, if $30,000 had been the max-
imum appiopuation foi suiveys annually, when
the Tieasury was unembanassed, aie we pie-
paied to increase it to the unusual amount of
jp55,00O when, if appiopu itions should be made
accoiding to the annual estimates, the ways and
means must be pnmded by the creation of a na
iional debt' Alieady the Committee on Military
Affaus had repoi ted a bill asking anappiopnation
of ¡¡,10,000 for rmlitdiy suiveys,and the Commit-
tee on Commerce had asked an additional sum of
$1d,000 forcommercia! suiveys, and the amend-
ment of the gentleman from Vtigima [Mr Mer-
cer] asked foi po.OOO moie He again asked,
is the House prepaied, with an exhausted Treas-
ui y, to exceed the usual appi opnauon for surveys
Mi MARVIN obtained the fjoor, and, the
subjects being connected, availed himself of the
opportunity to conclude his speech upon the in-
ternal improvement system, the constitutionality
of which he maintained at great length
Mi MALLORY then obtained the floor, and
moved an adjoui iment, but yielded it to
Mr CAMERELENG, who expressed a wish
to have all the appropnation bills made the spe-
cial order fiom day to day, til! disposed of
[Cries of" j\o'" " Not"]
Mi EELL suggested to make this bill the
special ordoi foi to moirow and next day
Mi CAMBRELENG had no objection, and he
