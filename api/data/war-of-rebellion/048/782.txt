During the engagement, with rare exceptions, the officers and men behaved gallantly and deserve high commendation. I take pleasure in mentioning the uniform good conduct of Colonel W. H. Ball, One hundred and twenty- second Ohio; Lieutenant Colonel J. W. Horn, Sixth Maryland, and Colonel M. R. McClennan, One hundred and thirty- eighth Pennsylvania Infantry, regimental commanders. They remained at their posts, and with skill and bravery urged on their men. Lieutenant Colonel M. M. Granger, Major J. C. Hill, Captains Sells, Ross, Cornyn, Guss, Walter, Stewart, Prentiss, Bradshaw, Martin, Beaver, Rouzer, Spangler, Moore, McElwain, and many others deserve high commendation. Colonel McClennan was severely wounded in the foot late in the action, and was obliged to leave the field. Lieutenant James A. Fox, One hundred and tenth Ohio Infantry, was killed. He commanded a company, and, as upon former occasions, distinguished himself. He rose from the ranks to his position in the army. He was not only brave, but an accomplished gentleman and soldier. He commanded the esteem of all who knew him. His loss will be deeply deplored by his many friends.

The total killed in my brigade was 1 officer and 32 enlisted men; wounded, 7 officers and 137 enlisted men. A list of the casualties by regiments is hereto appended.*

On the morning of the 28th, the enemy having retreated, the brigade was marched to a point between the plank and turnpike roads leading from Fredericksburg to Orange Court- House. A short halt was made near Robertson's Tavern. The troops were put in position facing the enemy, where he was strongly posted behind Mine Run, between us and Orange Court- House and covering the two roads named. The troops bivouacked in their position until 2 p. m., November 29, when my brigade, under the direction of Brigadier- General Carr, was formed for an attack in line of battle, and in the rear of the Third Brigade, Third Division, Third Army Corps (Colonel Smith). The attack was not made.

At 4 a. m., November 30, was marched to the left upon the plank road and again formed as before, for an attack, which was again abandoned. About 2 p. m. the brigade, with the other troops of the division, was marched to its late position near the center of the whole line. The troops bivouacked in this position until 7 p. m., December 1, 1863, when orders were received from Brigadier- General Carr to march in advance of the division. The troops marched to the Rapidan River, and crossed at Culpeper Ford about 4 a. m., December 2. The march was resumed about 12 m. toward Brandy Station. The troops bivouacked about sundown near Richardsville. At 12 o'clock midnight the march was resumed for Brandy Station, at which place the brigade arrived about 6 a. m., December 3, and went into camp, where it still remains.

During the march temporary delays were occasioned by getting upon the wrong road, and also by artillery and teams stalling on bad roads. This latter was particularly the case upon the march to Culpeper Ford, on the night of the 1st instant.

On the entire campaign my orders were received from Brigadier- General Carr, commanding division.

I beg further to report that many sick were conveyed from Brandy Station in ambulances, to their great injury and the inconvenience
