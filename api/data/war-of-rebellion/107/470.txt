General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Clarksburg, Va.:

Yours of 1st instant received. A wounded prisoner taken yesterday says the attack on both sides yesterday was a preconcerted and serious effort, but there is little danger to the apprehended from such attacks. They annoy and weary the men without being serious. On New River road we shall take the aggressive to-day. On the side of the Fayette road there is no good opportunity for posting a small body where the skirmishers of the enemy cannot surround them on the mountains, and we shall have to keep closer in till we can spare a sufficient body to attack their whole force. Two regiments starting below, about ten miles, could pass beyond Fayette and take that force in rear, driving it this way and clearing it out. The enemy lost a cavalry captain and five men killed on the Fayette road and five killed on the New River road. We had no one killed; one man supposed to be was only slightly hurt and got back from the picket he was at.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
