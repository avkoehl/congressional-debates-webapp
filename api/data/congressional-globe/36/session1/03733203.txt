CALIFORNIA AND WASHINGTON MAIL.
Mr. LANE. I move that the Senate take up
bill H. R. No. 715. It is a bill that provides for
a mail service between Sacramento, in California,
and Oiympia, in Washington.
The motion was agreed to: and the Senate, as
in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill (H. R. No. 115) to establish a mail six
times a week from Sacramento, m California, to
Oiympia, in the Territory of Washington. It
directs the Postmaster General to so modify the
contract with the contractors now performing
services on routes 12543 and 12555 as to provide
for the conveyance of the entire United States
mail in four-horse stages, daily, at a schedule
of seven days from April 1 to December 1, and
twelve days the remainder of the year, from Sac-
ramento, via Yreka, Jacksonville, Ro.seburg,Oak- I,
land, and Sah-m, to Portland, Oregon, for a com- |j
| pensation of $90,000 per year, the contract to :â– 
i expire September 15, 18G4; and the Postmaster ||
! General is also directed to establish a service six !i
times a week, at a schedule of thirty-six hoqrs 
throughout the year, from Portland, Oregon, via
Vancouver, St. Helen 5s, and Monticello, to Oiym-
pia, in Washington Territory, by a contract,
a rate of compensation not to exceed the rate per
mile allowed from Sacramento to Portland, with
steamer service from Portland to Cowlitz, and
from Cowlitz to Oiympia by four-horse stages;
and the Postmaster is also directed to discbntinue
the ocean scrvicc from San Francisco to Oiympia,
via Portland and Astoria, Oregon, so soon as the
service contemplated by this act is established.' '
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no ob-
jection, the word "General" will be inserted in
the bill after the word "Postmaster." It is an
accidental omission. The Chair hears no objec-
tion.
Mr. MASON. I should like to have some in-
formation about this bill: whether it is recom-
mended by the Post Office Department, or comes
fron? a committee of this body.
Mr. GWIN. I will state that it is a House
bill, was reported from the Committee on the
Post Office and Post Roads in the House of Rep-
resentatives, came to the Senate, and has been
reported by the Committee on the Post Office and
Post Roads of this body. It is to establish a
daily line of stages from Sacramento, by Port-
land, to Oiympia, m the place of a semi-monthly
service, at a diminution of expense of $10,000,
and six times a week instead of semi-monthly.
We get twenty-four trips a month, instead of two,
at $10,000 less expense, going through the most
populous portions of California, Oregon, and
Washington.
Mr. COLLAMER. I wish to ask the gentle-
man one question. I wish to ask why, if we es-
tablish mail routes, the whole subject of these mail
routes should not be left to the Postmaster Gen-
eral ?
Mr. GWIN. I will state that the route goes
over two mountains, the Trinity mountains and
the Scott river mountains; and that there is avast
expense necessary to make the road. That ex-
pense has already been incurred; and it is neces-
sary, in order to meet the expenses that the con-
tractors on the routes that are named, and the
persons in the neighborhood, have had to un-
dergo, amounting to probably one hundred thou-
sand dollars, in making these roads, to give them
a contract to run for a series of years to carry
the mails through this part of the country. It is
through the heart of the population of those two
States; and it supersedes a service which is only
semi-monthly.
Mr. COLLAMER. That semi-monthly mail
is carried to Oiympia from the Columbia river.
Mr. GWIN. It is carricd from San Francisco
to Oiympia.
Mr. COLLAMER. By water?
Mr. GWIN. Yes, sir.
Mr. COLLAMER. You mean around by Pu-
gets5 Sound5
Mr. GWIN. Yes, sir.
Mr. COLLAMER. Is it to supersede that al-
together ? â€ž
Mr. GWIN. Yes, sir.
Mr. COLLAMER. Why should not the Post-
master General have the subject in his own hands,
and if we establish a mail route, let him put it in
operation ?
Mr. GWIN. He has it all in his own hands.
He will not establish this route unless he discon-
tinues the other. It gives us this service daily,
which is of great importanceâ€”going through the
heart of the population of those two Statesâ€”and
discontinues the other. He has the power in his
own hands.
Mr. HAMLIN. 1 am going to vote for this
bill. I have examined it somewhat, and 1 think
it is right. It will be a saving to the finances of
the Government, I think, if I am right, of some
fifty thousand dollars a year, by discontinuing*
the steamer service. While I do this, I want to
see how consistent gentlemen are on the other
side of the Chamber. We had up the Post Office
deficiency bill, and we were told it was perfectly
horrid to put any executive detail into that bill
for service; and we have got up a bill here now
advocated by the very Senators who fought that
to desperation because it had a very little of detail
m it. Here you have got a bill that carries out
the whole thing. I think it all right enough, and
1 am going to vote for it; but I want to see men
