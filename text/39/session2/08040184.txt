tension, Construction, and Use of a lateral
branch of the Baltimore and Potomac Rail-

Whereas it is represented to this present

of the before-recited act, to construct a lateral
branch from the said Baltimore and Potomac
Railroad to the District of Columbia: There-
fore, *
Be it enacted by the Senate and Rouse of Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the Baltimore and
Potomac Railroad Company, incorporated by
the said act of the General Assembly of Mary-
land, shall be, and they are hereby, authorized
to extend into and within the District of Co-
lumbia a lateral railroad, such as the said com-
pany shall construct or cause to be constructed
in a direction toward the said District, in con-
nection with the railroad which they are about
to locate and construct from the city of Balti-
more to the Potomac river, in pursuance of
their said act of incorporation ; and the said
Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Company
are hereby authorized to exercise the same
powers, rights, and privileges, and shall be
subject to the same restrictions, in the exten-
sion and construction of the said lateral rail-
road into and within the said District, as they
may exercise or are subject to under and by
intent of their said charter or act of incorpora-
tion, in the extension and construction of afty
railroad within the State of Maryland; and
' shall be entitled to the same rights, compen-
sation, benefits, and immunities, in the use of
the said road, and in regard thereto, as are
provided in their said charter, except the right
to construct any lateral road or roads within
the said District from the said lateral branch
or road hereby authorized ; it being expressly
understood that the said Baltimore and Poto-
mac Railroad Company shall have power only
to construct from the said Baltimore and Poto-
mac Railroad one lateral road within the said
District to some point or terminus within the

mined in the manner hereinafter mentioned.

fore the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Com-

or other materials necessary for the construc-
tion of said road, on any land within the
said District, they shall first obtain the assent
of the owner of such land, improvements, or
materials; or if such owner shall be absent
from said District, or shall refuse to give
such assent on such terms as the said com-
pany shall approve, or because of infancy,
coverture, insanity, or any other cause, shall
be legally incapable of giving such assent, then
it shall be lawful for the said company to apply
to a justice of the peace of the county of Wash-
ington, who shall thereupon issue his warrant,
under his hand and seal, directed to the mar-
shal of the said District, requiring him to sum-
mon a jury of twenty citizens of the said Dis-
trict, none of whom shall be interested or
related to any person interested in the land or
materials required for the construction of the
said railroad, or a stockholder, or related to
any stockholder in the said company, to meet
on the land, or near to the other property
or materials so required, on a day named in
such warrant, not less than ten nor more than
twenty days after issuing the same, to proceed
to value the damages which the owner or
owners of any such land or other property will
sustain by the use or occupation of the same
required by the said company, and the pro-
ceedings, duty, and authority of the said mar-
shal in regard to such warrant and jury, and
the oath or affirmation to be administered, and
inquisition to. be made and returned, shall be
the same as are directed and authorized in
regard to the sheriff by the thirteenth section
of the said act of the General Assembly of the
State of Maryland, incorporating the said Bal-
timore and Potomac Railroad Company ; and
all the other proceedings in regard to such
jury, and the estimating and valuation of dam-
ages, and the payment or tender of payment

lands or other property or materials, as to giv-
ing the said company a right to use the same

shall in every case and in every respect be the
same as is provided in and by the above-men-
tioned act of corporation, in regard to the rail-
road thereby authorized to be constructed by
the said company: Provided, That whenever,
by the said act, the inquisition of the jury is
required to be returned to the clerk of the
circuit court, to be confirmed by the said court
at its next session, if not sufficient cause to
the contrary be shown, the inquisitions under
this act shall be returned by the marshal to the
supreme court of the District of Columbia,
which court shall have the same jurisdiction
Mid powers over the subject-matter as the said
circuit court have under the act aforesaid.
Sec. 3. And be it further enacted, That when-
ever the said company, in the construction of
a railroad into or within the said District, as
authorized by this act, shall find it necessary to
cross or intersect any established road, street,
or other way, it shall be the duty of the said
company so to construct the said railroad across
such established road, street, or other way, as
not to impede the passage or transportation of
persons or property along the same ; and where
it shall be necessary to pass the said railroad
through the land of any individuals within the
said District, i*. shall be the duty of the said
company to provide for such individuals proper
wagon ways across the said railroad, from one
part of his [their] land to another; but noth-
ing herein contained shall be so construed as
to authorize the entry by said company upon
any lot or square, or upon any part of any lot
or square owned by the United States within
the limits of the- city of Washington, for the
purposes of locating or constructing the said
road, or of excavating the same, or for the
purpose of taking therefrom any material, or
for any other purpose or uses whatsoever; but
the said company, in passing into the District
aforesaid, and constructing the said road within
the same, shall enter the city of Washington at
such place, and shall pass along such public
street or alley, to such point or terminus
within the said city as may be allowed by Con-
gress upon presentation of survey and map of
proposed location of said road: Provided,

ferent level.

been or shall be constructed by the said Balti-
more and Potomac Railroad Company, on such
terms as shall be approved of by the competent
officer or authority, and in all such instances
to receive the compensation so agreed for,
according to the terms of each contract.

said railroad company may charge and receive
for taking up and setting down any passenger
or traveles within the District, conveyed a
shorter distance than four miles, a sum not
exceeding twelve cents.
Sec. 7. And be it further enacted, That
unless the said company shall commence the
said lateral road within two years, and com-
plete the same with at least one set of tracks
within four years from the passage of this' act,
then this act, and all rights and privileges
thereby granted, shall cease and determine.
Sec. 8. And be it further enacted, That noth-
ing herein contained shall be so construed as
to prevent the Congress of the United States
from granting the same or similar privileges to
those hereby granted to any other company
or companies incorporated or to be incorpo-
rated by the State of Maryland, or by Congress,
or from authorizing, by any future law, such
additional railroads or roads, in connection
with the said road, so as to extend the same
road, or to construct others connected there-
with, to such parts of the District as from time
to time may bev required by the convenience
of those parts of the District into which the
said company are now restrained from carrying
said road, or from enacting such rules and
regulations prescribing the speed of cars or
carriages passing over said road, and any other
matterifelating thereto, necessary for the secur-
ity of tne persons and property of the inhab-
itants of the District, in such manner as to the
present or any future Congress shall seem
expedient: And provided, nevertheless, That
nothing herein contained shall be construed to
give any rights or privileges to the said com-
pany beyond the limits of the District of
Columbia: And provided further, That Con-
gress shall have power to alter, amend, or
repeal this act.
