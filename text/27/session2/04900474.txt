4?4                                           CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
ÍVIr FULTON was not aware that such a bill was in con
tempiauon
Mr EVANS observed there was, and that he understood it
would be pursued he hoped the Senator from Arkansas would
therefore wi'hdiaw his amendment.
Mr. FULTON withdrew his motion.
And the bill was reported back to the Senate
Mr EVANS observed that the first amendment was only a
trifling amount of $10, and he would not insist on it.
The amendment was, accordingly, rejected
The question then coming up on concurring with the com
mitteeol the whole m the rest of the amendments-
Mr SEVlEtt called the attention of the Senator from Maine
fjtfr EvAisis] to the 113th appiopnation, and submitted a let*
terfromA C Dodge, explanatory of the claim for arrearages
due by the Government of Iowa Temtoiy
The letter was read by the Secretary of the Senate
Mr EVANS observed, that he had explained all this m com-
mittee of the whole    The Committee on Finance had come to
the conclusion that all the Territories ought to be placed on the
same footing, and that a separate Mil ought to be drawn up for
settling ail the arreaiages, but time shoull b° given for scrutin-
izing the accounts    He was prepaung a bill, which he had no
dftubtwouldbe passed for that object    He did notdesne the
appropriation to be now mai'e for those claims alluded to m
the letter, because the money would be handed over to the Ter
ritoriaí Secretary, and Congress could not audit the account
The first question was on the committee's amendment to
slnke out, at page L6, line 366, to end of 372, the provision for
arrearage, «13,400, due for the Government of the Teimory
of Iowa
Mr TAPPAN opposed the pioposition to strike out that por
tion of the section
Mr EVANS observed that there was no sufficient proof yet
adduced tf at tbisatrearage was due
Mr HUNTINGTON thought the Senator from Arkansas
hadshown, by the estimate m.gross, which he had produced,
that this amendment to strike out ought to be adopted
Mr SEVIER contended that the documents he had furnished
were extracts from the hooks of the department
Mr EVANS observed that they amounted to nothing but an
estimate in gross
Mr HUNTINGTON supported the views taken by the Sen
ator from Maine He xecapUulated all that Senator had said,
tmt, not being disposed to consume the time of the Senate, he
would only add that he hoped the amendment would be con-
curred in
Mr WRIGHT observed that this provision was put into the
bill at the instance of the repiesentauve of the Territory in the
House of Representatives, where it had a representative, and,
as he believed, upon good reasons shown One of thecircum-
stances was, that the printers employed by the legislative
Council to do certain printing were bound to fulfil their con
tract, under a penalty of $10000 The work was doie,and
S^OuO was due tor it The pi inters applied for their money,
showing that they lost by the contrat t, and that the very woi k
men were unpaid The money appiopuated for this printing
was applied to othei purposes, by the appropriations of the
Legislative Council, and the pnuteis were left without any This
was all wrong, but were those who had done the work to be left
unpaid* He hoped the amendment would not be concurred in
lhe question was then called and appeared to be determined
in ihe negative
Mr HUNTINGTON called foi the yeas and nays, which
were oidered, and resulted—yeas 15,uays2bj and so the amend-
ment was not concurred in
Mr SEVIER then offered his amendment as follows page
16, line372, aftei the woid "u e," insett "nor for any other
purpose notauthonzed by the act of Congiess establishing the
Territory of Iowa n
Also, after the word "dollars," line 366 after that part ma-
king appropriation for expenses of the Legislative Council of
JowaTerritory, to insert "the accounts for which shall first be
audited and allowed by the proper accounting officer of the
Treasury "
Mr EVANS objected, for the reasons before given
-Mr WOODBRIDGE was in favor of all such matters being
made subjects of separate legislation
Mr. SÉVIBR observed that his resolution was only as to fu-
ture expenditures
Mr TALLMADGE had always voted for these Territories, and
for that reason he would preler that all weie placed on the
same fooung
Mr WHITE said that the proposed amendment was a propo-
sition to make a proclamation, in advance, that a Territory shall
not spend more than another Congress may appropriate   This
he was opposed to    If it was necessary, let the restriction be
pioduced in a separate bill
Mr  PORTER make an observation not distinctly heard
Mr SEVIER modified his amendment as follows
Provided, further, That the Legislative Assembly of no
Territory may hereafter  in any m&ta ce, or under any pretext
whatever, exetei the amount appiopnated by Congress for us
annual expenses," which was agreed to, and the amendment
was adopted
Mr EVANS called foi the question on all the othei amend
menfs agreed to in Committee of the Whoíe
Aír  HENDERSON wished to except that in thc2bth page,
lines 602 and 603, for an increase of $o,000 to ¡he appiopnation
foi printing statistics and reports of the census, to defray the ev
penses of distributing the compendium and returns
Mr EVANs consented to make the exception
The question was then taken on the rem lining amendments,
and they were adopted
The question then came on the excepted amendment
Mr   HENDERSON'S objection wa*, thattheiewasno neces
eity for spending any thing at all on this distubution, foi such
States and Temtories as wanted the books wouMsend for them,
or pay the cost of carrying them   Iiutit he was wiongmthis, he
had another objection—hf believed the sum was dittble what it
ought to be    He might vote lor an addition of$3 000, but would
not for ¿|3000     It had been said the books would weich "¡l
tons, but there was no necessity to pay upwards of & 100 a ton
for carnage
Mt. EVaNS pointed out that, if nothing be appiopnated,
nothing will begdone in regard to the distribution, if £6 000 be
appropuated, the distribution will be mdfa throueh the ordi
nary modes of transportation, but H $8000 be appropuated,
the distribution can be made carefully and satisfactorily. The
boxes to pack the books in would cost #3 000
Mr, HENDERSON objected to paymgWen or eight ecu's
i  a pound for carriage of bo >ks, when lumber of any other kind
i   might be transported for hali that cost
Mi PRESTON saw no necessity for mcuiring any ex
pense of distnbution at all If the States and Territories e'e
sire the books, oi any of their libraries, colleges, oi public in
stnutions want them, they will piovide ways and mean? for
getting them Let the books go to the S ate Department, and
, he there t.ll sent (or He was altogether adverse to the propo
i   sition, it wasoverlegi^atioi
Mr BAYaUD contended that the oily question could he,
whethei this appropriation was extravagant oi not  1 he Gov
ernment is constitutionally charged with the duty of collecting
this information and was it not equally charged with the duly
of communicating it to the country at largei No bet'er way
could be proposed oí doing so, than by the means oí special
agents to distnbu te die books fairly
Mr  McROBERTS thoughtall tbatthc&tates and Territories
could ask was, to get the books printed and bound, and ship
ped to then order, they paying the cost oí transmission them
selves     líe was opposed to the proposition oí sending agents
to makethisdistnbution
The question was then put on adopting the amendment, and
it appealed tobe detei mined in the negative by a tie vote—

So the amendment was not adopted
Mr EVANS moved an amendment to the 367th line, page 16,
which was adopted, wnhoutdissent
Mr WRIGHT now offered the amendment which he submit
ted a few days ago, to which he would add a slight modificauon
The amendment, as modified, was as follows.
P me 22, line 011    At the end o f the line insert—
i(P¡ovided, however, That every district attorney, clerk of
a district court, cierk of a circuit cdutt, and marshal of the
United States, shall, upon the first days of January and July m

said office "
Mr WRIGHT did not desire to detain the Senate, further
than to draw its attention to the difiéreme between the pro-
visions oí the bill and the law of 1841 His object ía-the amend-
ment wasto íecur to thp law oí 1841 and make such provision
as may insure the limitauon intended by that law. The only
way in which he thought Congress could do it, was in the way he
proposed It would have but little practical operation on any
district but the southern district of New York He explained
the technical effects of the amendment on the business of the
coutts and the accounting officers This, the amendment itself
fully explained His object was to lift the officers out of the
way of censure The system of fees was altogether vague and
loose Congress rested upon the fee-bills oí the states. It
turned out that some States had no f e bills at all, and their of
ficéis would be cut off from all compensation for their services,
if not otherwise provided ioi In thesouthem district of New
York, the fee bill of 1759 was most exorbitant, and particularly
with regard to the marshal The late district attorney (Mr
Butler) had informed him that the mere mechanical duties,
which any clerk could pet form, were paid for enormously;
while the duties of the principal, requiring most skill and men
tal capacity, were very poorly lemunerated
Mr EVaNS observed that he had said the other d y all he
intended to say as to the impropriety of legislating ia an appro-
priation bill lie would now only say, m íegard to the last
proviso of the amendment, that he knew of no reason why com-
pensation should not be allowed for extra attendance at the
coiirtc , and he would propose an addition to the last line, pro-
viding that when thccleik, marshal, and officers are instructed
to attend by the judge, or the attorney by the Solicitor of the
Tieasury, to periorm duties of the court, the court «hall be as-
sumed tobe open, and they shall be paid for such attendance
Mr WRIG HT approved of theamendment; and it was adopt-
ed, as follows
"Provided^ fuither, That the district attorney, marshal,
clerk of the circuit court, and clerk of the district court of the
United States for the northern and southern districts of New
Yoik, «hall not, hereafter, receive any greater or other fees
and emoluments, including fees and emoluments under the act
entitled 'An act to establish a uniform system of bankruptcy
thi ougnout the United States,' for sei vices rendered by them re-
spectively m the said courts, than now are, or hereafter may be,
allowed by the laws of the State of New York to attorneys, so-
licitors, counsel, sheriffs and clerks in the highest courts of law
oi equity, oí original jurisdiction, of the State of New York, ac-
cording to the nature of the proceedings, for like services ren-
dered therein "
The question then came up on the amendment as amended
Mr BERRlENobjected totheumfoim scale of remunerating
officers whether the duties are more or less He thought the
compensaron ought to be m proportion to the services perform-
ed He thought the best mode of meeting all the beanngs of
the subject would be, no' to mix it up with an appropriation
bill, but to leave it foi adjustment m a bill preparing by the Ju-
diciary Committee, which will piovlde foi a uniform system
throughout the whole of the States His desire would be, not to
be hurned into this mattei lie trusted the amendments would
not e adopted, but, if persisted m, he would prefer its being
leitovei for further consideration
Mr BUCHANAN would vote for the amendment of the
Senator fiom New Yoik with veiy great pleasure He was
apprehensive the Senator fiom Georgia [Mr Berrien] would
find his plan of a fee bill, umfoim for all the States of the
Union, impracticable He would find that, instead of being
justandsatisfactdy, it would bequitethe reverse He thought
the auditing of the accounts by the Secretary of the Treasury
the greatest improvement proposed by the Senator from New
Yoi k He pointed out the inconveniences of placing the audit-
ing of the accounts m the hands of the judges He believed the
judges would be veiy glad to get rid of the onerous duty. He
would vote for the amendment most cheerfully, and believed
H would be a great imprevement
Mr BAYARD considered the fee-bill not as a compensation
for labor performed, but as a tax on smtois, instead of a tax on
the whole community to support the expenses of the judicial y,
and the officers intrusted with the collection of this tax are
permitted to keep, for their own compensation, a given portion
This arrangement is necessary, because, when there is a great
accumulation of business, the tax will be much too large to
remunerate an individual, and when there is a small amount of
business, the individual performing the duties would not be
compensated by what he would receive. It never could be in-
tended that a mere cierk m a judicial office should be entitled
to fees amounting to $15,000, while a cleik in a bank, perform-
ing as many and as responsible duties, receives but $1,500
The real theory is, that a fee-bill is a tax-bill, authorized by the
penal power of the Government, and rendered necessary by the
duty of admimstring justice The compensation to indi-
vidual  should not be the whole tax, but such portion as may
oe considered sufficient remuneration for his services. He
would vote, with great pleaauie, for the amendment
Mr IIENDERfcON dtffeied entirely from the Senator from
Delaware, that this was properly an application of the taxing
power It was, he consideied, a power incidental to the power
given in the Constitution to provide for the administration of
pihtice He refened to and reíd, the enumeiated powers of
Government given by the Constitution He contended there
could bp no authoi ity derived from any of the'-e powers to lay
a tax on the administration of justice for purposes of revenue
He knew the difficulty of adjusting a fee bill that could be
jmrly uniform He believed it could not be done The sources
of revenue are pointed out m tí o Constitution, and, among them,
thatottaxmsr justice is not one
Mi BAYARD hoped he was not understood as advocating a
tax on the adrnmiuratimi ol justice as a source of revenue; he
ha I said no'hng of that kind What he did sav was, that
fee bills were taxes on su.iOis to beai the expenses of the ad-
ministration of justice, andthxtit was more just to tax them
for that purpose, than the whole community
Mr HENDERSON spoke at conrle-able length m support
of his theory, that no revenue should be raised from taxes'on
the administration of justice HewouH oppose the proposi-
tion to put any surplus from fee bills into the Treasury of the
United States, in any shape or foim thai could be devised,
Mr WOODBURY understood the Senator's objection to be
of a constitutional nature.   But if his argument is good for
