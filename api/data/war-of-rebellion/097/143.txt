HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-11.23 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Signal and other officers report the enemy's line as strong as usual in my front. I reported this sometime since to army headquarters, and am just advised that General Meade is on his way to the front. If I do not hear from him in ten minutes I shall advance my picket-line, in pursuance of previous orders.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

11.20 A. M.

I shall push forward immediately.

H. G. WRIGHT.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-12 m. (Received 12.40 p. m.)

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

Please let me know at what hour you will probably attack the enemy's entrenchments. I do not mean their picket-line but the entrenchments.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-1.15 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Army Corps:

My first attack on enemy's picket-line has failed. I shall try it again with troops enough for and assault, as soon as their can be got in position. The enemy is strong in my front, and I think I may fail. I shall try, however, and hope to be ready within an hour for the main assault.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-3. 10 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have just carried the enemy's picket-line in front of Fort Fisher, the enemy opening not heavily with artillery. I shall push forward to their main line with what troops I have, if further developments will justify.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.

Sent above also to Major-General Webb.
