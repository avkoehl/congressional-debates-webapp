ing, including placer and quartz, the claims
differ in size. During the course of twenty
years before the passage of the original law,
where lodes were found to be very deep in the
earth or far in the hills, in order to run the
required tunnel it was necessary sometimes to
consolidate claims; and claims were consolid-
atedâ€”sometimes two, sometimes three, some-
times a dozen. Miners would thus consolidate
their claims, which made them of irregular sizes,
and often quite large. Now, the legislation of
1866 (and that of 1870 conformed to it) pro-
vided that claims existing at the time of that
legislation might be patented upon proper
proof, no matter what their extent, how large or
how small; but it is provided also that after the
passage of that legislation a certain size, which
this bill does not vary, should be conformed
to; that claims acquired under the mining law
should not be more than a certain size, which
I can give the gentleman if he desires. Of
course it would not do to confiscate a part of
a claim because the claim was large, when it
had been made so, very likely, either by some
one investing capital under the mining laws,
or by the action of two or three miners con-
curring together for the purpose of running a
long tunnel or erecting more than ordinarily
expensive crushing-works, or something of
that kind.
Mr. WILLARD. Will the gentleman from
California yield to me for a moment?
Mr. SARGENT. Certainly.
Mr. WILLARD. Mr. Speaker, I have not
examined this bill carefully, nor am I well
enough acquainted with the mining law as it
now exists to be able to speak with precision
about it. But it seems to me that a bill so
general in its provisions as this is ought to con-
tain some general saving clause, something
which will go further than the clause to which
the gentleman has already referred. I propose,
therefore, to add to section fourteen, which is
in itself a general repealing clause, this sav-
ing clause: provided that nothing contained
in this act shall be construed to impair in any
way rights or interests in mining property ac-
quired under existing laws.
Mr. SARGENT. I have no objection to
that amendment. It seems to me a very good
provision, and is entirely compatible with the
general scope of the bill.
The SPEAKER. Unless objected to, the
amendment will be considered as agreed to.
There was no objection, and the amend-
ment offered by Mr. Willard was adopted.
Mr. SARGENT. I now call the previous
question.
The previous question was seconded and
the main question ordered; and under the
operation thereof the bill was ordered to be
engrossed for a third reading : and being en-
grossed, it was accordingly read the third time,
and passed.
Mr. SARGENT moved to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was passed; and also
moved that the motion to reconsider be laid
on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

The bill was ordered to be engrossed and
read a third time; and being engrossed, it
was accordingly read the third time, and

saw nation, aud a letter of Edward Earle on

receipt of such certificate the Secretary of the
Treasury shall cause one half the amount so
certified to be invested in bonds of the United
States, bearing interest at the rate of five per
cent, per annum, which said amount so invested
shall constitute a perpetual fund in the Treas-
ury of the United States, to be known as the
national educational fund; and the Secretary
of the Treasury, on or before the 31st day of
July of each year, shall certify to the Secretary
of the Interior and the Commissioner of Edu-
cation, the amount so paid into the Treasury
to the credit of said educational fund, and the

of the income of the said educational fund so
certified, such apportionment to be according

year of such receipt by it, and not exceeding
the amount of ten per cent, in any year
