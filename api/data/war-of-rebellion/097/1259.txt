By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JUNE 6, 1865.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

In the list of nominations for promotions by brevet recently submitted by me were some names presented for promotions to full commissioned as well as some for brevets in the regular army. It was not my design to include these classes of cases in the list. Being placed there by the corps commanders, they were allowed to pass to save the delay that would result from returning the lists to the several corps. I now transmit a list of the names of general officers whom I should be glad to see promoted to full commissions and arranged in the order in which, according to my judgment, they should be promoted when vacancies occur:

To be full major-generals: Charles Griffin, corps commander; George W. Getty, N. A. Miles, R. B. Ayres, J. B. Ricketts, R. B. Potter, Gershom Mott, Frank Wheaton, H. J. Hunt, O. B. Willcox, S. W. Crawford, J. F. Hartranft, A. S. Webb, J. J. Bartlett, division commanders.

To be full brigadier-generals; Bvt. Brigadier Gens. W. H. Penrose, J. I. Curtin, George N. Macy, R. McAllister, John Ramsey, H. J. Madill, R. Coulter, C. D. MacDougall, J. W. Keifer, E. M. Gregory.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. G. MEADE.

Major-General, Commanding.
