SIR: Jeff. Davis, Breckindge, Benjamin, Trenholm, and other prominent officers of the Confederate Government crossed the river one week ago to-day thirteen miles above Fort Adams. Lieutenant-General Longstreet accompanies them. There is no doubt whatever of the truth of this information.

WOODVILLE ROAD, FIVE MILES FROM BAYOU SARA,

May 12, 1865.

Captain W. H. CLAPP:

CAPTAIN: Yesterday morning I sent a party to Fort Adams and went myself with another party to Woodville. The party that went to Fort Adams has not yet returned. Arrived at Woodville at noon and found a number of Confederate there. They are anxious to know where they are to go to be paroled. I was shown an order from General Humphreys requiring them to report at Jackson, Miss. They are anxious to report to some provost-marshal more convenient. Having no orders I could not advise them There are, I think, about 100 or more in that vicinity. The commissary and quartermaster have a small quantity of stores which they are ready to turn over. The Governor of Mississippi has issued a call for the legislature to convene soon. I learned that our troops now occupy Jackson, Miss. Reports say that Davis is over the river. One statement is that he went from Florida to Cuba, thence to Texas. Another that he crossed the Mississippi River. I conversed with a Confederate soldier, who said he knew General Hood had crossed. My impression is that Davis is out of the country. I will report again when the party returns from Fort Adams.
