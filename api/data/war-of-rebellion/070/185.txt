(Received 1.30 p. m.)

We are still hotly engaged. I have but 400 men and no word from General Sigel or our re-enforcements. Our stores are safely across the river. Unless the enemy come in large force I shall hold the town. Word has been received that the rebels in force are crossing at Point of Rocks. I am not able to raise that office. They received their orders last night, in case of an attack, to retire to this point. I shall not leave the town, except at the last necessity, and I have rations for thirty days on the heights, and shall hold them until reenforced. The bridges are yet entire and our men are doing well. We have lost but 1 officer and 20 men, and inflicted much damage on the enemy.

We are still engaged with the advance of the enemy. Our cavalry has retired. The main body of the enemy, in strong force, is rapidly advancing via Kearneysville. No re-enforcements have yet reached us. Nothing heard from General Sigel. If we leave the town the station at Sandy Hook will be kept open.
