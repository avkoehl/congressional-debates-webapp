FORT SUMTER, July 7, 1864 - 4 p. m.

The enemy continue a heavy fire on us. Their evident intention is to destroy our boom and our defenses against assault, as also to break through the gorge wall. In the first part of their plan they have to some extent succeeded. The fire is quite as damaging as any bombardment since the year commenced. We have no labor to repair. Can't you send me 50 more men?
