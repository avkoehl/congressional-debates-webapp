Maim Baundary Question-*~-Mr. Fillmore.
Ha. of Reps.
bp submitted to the arbitiament of argument) en-
tuely niesistible, so long as the existing undei-
standing shall remain umeseinded
But, sit, it appears that argument and negotia-
tion are to be discontinued by Great Britain, and
the more cogent instrumentality of arms to be
substituted in the enforcement of this claim to
exclusive jurisdiction It is announced, officially
and unconditionally, by the provincial authori-
ties of New Brunswick that they have perempto
i y instructions fiom the British Government to
enforce this claim by aims, if aims be necessaiy,
and that those instructions shall, at all hazards,
be executed, if the powers of the British arms in
all the provinces are adequate to their execution
Sir, this new manifestation of purpose wholly
alters the aspect of the controversy. It proposes
to deprive the United States of the advantages
which they obviously possess under an original
view of the respective claims of the two nations,
unaffected by any agieement or understanding
It proposes to trample under foot an explicit un
deistandmg, solemnly and foimally recognized,
forbidding the pretension now urged It pro-
poses, finally and woist, to withdraw the adjust-
ment of her claim from the field of reason and
negotiation, and to adjourn it over to the field of
arms' I his, sir, is the new position which
Great Butain has chosen to assume It is alto-
gether her act She has a right to assume that
oi any other position she pleases with respect to
this controversy, we cannot prevent that The
question now, sir, is, " How shall the United
States meet this new position ' '
Mr Speaker, I am fully sensible of the com
paiative insignificance of the teintoiy in dispute
1 have, I tiust, duly weighed the deep calamities
of war in any foim, and especially between two
nations as poweiful and as closely connected in
commeicial and other relations as Great Butain
and the United States I know that this nation
is unpiepared for war I believe 1 have sobeily
weighed all the motives to peace, nor have the
dangers to which wai must ever expose mstitu
tionshkeoursboenunconsideied Alltbpsethmgs
have been calmly and resolutely looked in the
face, and, in the full view of them all, I stand in
readiness to repel the pretensions of Great Brit-
ain by reason and negotiation—peaceably, if she
is disposed to reason and negotiate peaceably, and
in perfect íeadmess to lepel her pretensions by
arms, if she is disposed to compel us to that re-
sort' Sir, if Great Britain pei&ists m backing
hei pretensions by aims, but one alternative is
left us—dishonor or wai, and, sir, dishonor the
spnit of this nation will not enduie Choice of
peace or wai is with Gieat Britain She will man
lftst her choice of war by persisting to execute
the instiuctions avowed by the piovincial author
Hies Foi, sn, to the peaceable execution of
these instructions this country cannot submit,
and never will submit, it is the price of i s honor
to submit In such an event war is inevitable on
our pait a ughteous war, upon which the smiles
of the God of battles may be confidently invoked
If Great Britain wills war, let war come ' This
nation,armed in the rnrhteousnessofsuch a cause,
has nothirg to fear—all to expect
In the present postuie of this controversy, sir,
theieis no occasion, noi is it proper to animad-
vert upon the course of our own Government for
several years past, in the conduct of these nego-
tiations That unjustifiable delays have been
submitted to, may probably be shown False
stepson mmoi points may have been occasionally
taken to our prejudice This would but affoid
cause of complaint by the nation against its own
Government, whilst, at the same time, the posi-
tion of Great Britain is rendered, by that cause,
still more indefensible Nor would this be an
appropriate occasion for airaying the wiongs—
still unredressed—which this countiy has sufteied
from Gieat Bntam by encroachments on other
portions of ourterntoiy, or the unatoned outrage
upon our termory and ti e lives of our people in
the affair of the Caiolme These are subjects
which stand open for discussion on then own
merits, and in the mode which becomes them
The piesent emergency alone is now to be looked
to, and prouded for—by itself and foi itself and
the measures of legislation taken by Congiess
should regard the emeigency m that light    I am
happy, sir, that the Committee on Foreign Rela-
tions, to which these momentous subjects were
committed, have so regarded it I agree with
them generally in the reasoning of their report—
entnely agree with them in its tone
With íespectj su, to the bill reported by the
committee, I regiet that it is not, in my opinion,
wholly free from objection The second section,
piovidingfor so large a contingent augmentation
of the tegular force is, I think, unnecessary at
the present moment It confers vast discretion-
al y powers upon the President Those powers
may not be abused, it is true, but it is no less
true that they are liable to abuse, and may be
abused It is in seasons like this that free nations
aie most apt, in their efforts to guard against
dangers from abroad, to forego their accustomed
jealousy of power, by erecting piecedents of dis-
ci etion which plant the seeds of fatal dangers
from within I trust that the committee them-
selves will, on reflection, perceive the inexpedi-
ency of this provision, and decline further to
press it * Nor should I have recommended, as
the committee have done, a special embassy to
England. I am not suie that the present posture
of affairs is such as, in strict delicacy, to require
or even warrant it Yet in the spnit of forbeat-
ance and peace which I hope may everchaiacter-
íze the counsels of this countiy, I shall interpose
no resistance to the measuie,and shall be happy
in the expectation that it, amongst other raeas-
uies, may conduce to a speedy termination of
this unfortunate controversy, peaceably and hon-
oiably to both nations
I have but to add, sn, the expression of my
unaffected and piofound disne foi peace, and at
the same time, my conviction, notless unaffected
and piofound, that the enforcement  by aims of
the late pietenstons of Gnat Butain, as thieat
encd by her piovincial authouties, is niconipat
lble with honoiable peace      If Gieat Biitain, m
violation of our rights, in disiegard of oui own
solemn engagements, shall piccipitate a wai, this
nation, I believe, will, as one  man, brace  itself
for the conflict     Other gentlemen  better und<r-
stand than I do the spnit existing in their re-
spective sections of the Union     The nation has,
in the histoty of the past, a guarintee  that the
legionin which Kentucky is situated will be found
piomptly obedient to the calls of the national
honor     Satisfy them that peace is dishonoiable,
and they aie foi war   11 ey will not mqune how
much or  how little  terntoiy is involved  in the
dispute, they will  not suuendor  an  inch, if it
mvolvis a santifico of th<  national honor    They
will ni ver consent to giadeate honor by inteiest
Thev fought the battles of the country in the
late war, fiom  the Thamts to the B dire, over
questions wholly mantime,in which they had no
dnect inteiest     Yet, sir, the national honoi de
manded that-war, and mtntime in  ltsonginas
it was, it found nowheit in the Union more ai
dentand steadfast votaucsthan wci   f undatliou
sind miles in the   mleiioi      Sir, as   they  were
piompt then, &o they vvi 1 be piomj t n >w to vm
dicate to the utmost,and to the lost ex'iemity, the
honor of the countiy      They will not now cleit
late, as in times past they never have calculated,
the sacrifices which such a contest may involve
They regard  the maintenance of the  national
character and honor as paramount to all oilier
considerations, for they see in it the only means
of enjoying, in security, any of the inestin able
blessings which Heaven has plainly reserved for
their country     Tor this they deem  no   sacnfice
too dear     Money, propeity,  blood—count and
measure it all—it is  yours, freely—if the \indi-
cation of the national honor demands it'

SPEECH OF HON M. FILLMORE,
OF NEW YORIc,
K Till. House of Representatives,
Mmckl, 18o9,
On the bill giving the liesident "ddi íonai power for the
il tcn^e of the Cn ail tenter, S-c
Mr   riLLMORL sa d it w u,  \ ith extieme
reluctance  that, in hit. feeble state of healtn, he
* The section was rejected I)} the House
said a word to protract this debate, nor should
he have done so, but that he felt that ins own
constituents might have as deep an interest in
the results of this bill as the inhabitants of any
portion of the United States This bill, if he
could credit what had been said by the gentleman
from Maine, [Mr Evans,] or read by the gen-
tleman from Maryland) [Mr Howard,] was nei-
ther more nor less than a contingent declaration
of war with Great Bi nam In such an event his
constituents had a deep and obvious interest It
was true, that on the face of the bill, and in the
wording of the first, second, and third sections,
it seemed to be contemplated that our collision
with that Power would be confined chiefly to the
fiontier of Maine, but such would not turn out
to be the fact If resort was once had to arms,
the matter would not end by a brief sknmish in
Maine That little tiact of territory, cold and
barren as a Siberian desert, was of but small
value, but for the timber it contained That
would not be the battle-field on which this con-
test must be settled, the scene of conflict would
extend along the entire northern frontier of the
Union, and its chief seat would be upon the gieat
northern lakes If it was true, as the gentleman
affirmed, that even the President himself did not
fully appieciate the urgency of the crisis, what
must be the consequence, upon that crisis, of
passing a bill like this? What did the bill con-
temp'ate' What was the very first step it pro-
posed 5    It went at once to commit us to war de
facto The first section went on the supposition
that Great Butain would enforce the claim shp
had set up by a resort to arms Was there any
ieason to suppose that this would be done' The
gentleman fiom Maine had told the House that
it would be attempted at once, and that a collision
has already taken place
Mi EVANS What I said, and what I now
siy is, tint if Maine shall be left alone by this
Government, she will be attacked, but it is my
opinion that if this bill passes, no such attempt
will be made, and that the bill, mstea-d of pro-
ducing, will pievent hostilities I lepeat the
declai ation that I look to it as a measure of peace,
and my only fear is that it may come too late
The moment the piovincial authorities find that
if they advance they meet you and not Maine
alone, rely upon it they will wait for advices fiom
then Government
Mi riLLMORE The gentleman then con-
cedes that it is piobable collision may have al-
leady taken place We aie, then, acting on a
contingency, with little time to dtlibeiate, and
none to retiact any ¡>tep we mav take Suppose
there shall be a collision btfoie the lesult of oui
dchbeiationsis known Congi ess will be defunct,
ind what will be the duty of the Piesident' To
wait till he can lay propositions bcfoie the Gov-
ernment of Gieat Bntam' lo pause and nego-
tiate, and then go to war'    No     The nation is
I iictncv illy commuted, and it will be his duty
it oimc to expel the invading fllCf No altcina
ti\e is k ft him luck is no chineo oi space for
lepentaice oi advice We have assumid that
he act of Sn John Harvey is the aft of his Gov-
1 ernment, and the Picbidcnt is at once to pioceed
to hosulitits I am not prepared to say that even
this may not be ntcessaiy Horn the little ix
animation I havt given to the subject, I have no
doubt whatever that Maine is in the right The
only question is as to the manner and the time in
■which her light is to be enfoiced In this ques
tion the whole countiy is inteiested, and espi cial-
ly the people of my own distuct It appears to
me that the Cimmittee on Foieign Allans have
dnected their attention exclusively to the inter-
ests and lights of Mame, and hive, to a great
extent, oveilooked the gieat interestb of othei
poitions of the Union in this mat er Ought they
to haveforgot'enthe defenseless position in which
the whole noithern fiontier would be placed in
case of awar' I am suijium d to find not one
so itary provision m this bi 1 for the def nse of a
lake fiontier of fifteen bundled miles, v/ith not a
single fort unon the while lini , mi a smjle
