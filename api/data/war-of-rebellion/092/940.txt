Adjutant and Inspector General:

I arrived here last evening. General Hardee reports considerable fighting yesterday at Coosawhatchie, without definite results; enemy holding a position near there and railroad. Heavy skirmishing at Numbers 2, Central railroad, with large force of enemy, which has crossed Ogeechee opposite that point. Fighting also at Cannouchee bridge. Enemy has made his appearance at Hudson's Ferry and Matthews' Point, on Savannah River. Gun-boat Macon is at Sister's Ferry, with orders to patrol river as high up as Hudson's Ferry. Howard's wing of Federal Army believed, on right bank of Ogeechee, crossing. Generals Hardee and Jones should be supported with all available force.

Lieutenant-General HARDEE,

Savannah, GA.:

Having no army of relief to look to, and your forces being essential to the defense of Georgia and South Carolina, whenever you shall have to select between their safety and that of Savannah, sacrifice the latter, and form a junction with General Jones, holding the left bank of the Savannah River and the railroad to this place as long as possible.
