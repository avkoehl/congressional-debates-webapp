General Pleasonton's cavalry being ordered away, we shall not have cavalry to scout the country till General Buford's arrive. Scouts report all quiet toward Fairfax and Little River pike.

Brigadier General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

I have waited here to see the general, who sent me word he would be here for that purpose some time in the night. Shall be off with what force I have, viz, Sixth Cavalry and two other companies, as soon as possible, to Falls Church, from whence I shall scout as directed. My headquarters to Captain Custer last night. An express is just in from Langley, from my squadron there. It is scouting toward Dranesville, and also in the direction of Vienna. No enemy heard from yet. My expresses have great difficulty in getting through the different commands, being constantly stopped. There is no need of stopping them within our lines. It will be well to have the telegraph extended to Falls Church, and send me some of the Signal Corps, for service ahead of that point. Lieutenants Clark and Camp, who were with me at Haxall's, are very good. Please have supplies for my command ordered to be forwarded by railroad to a point opposite Falls Church, where I can make my depot.
