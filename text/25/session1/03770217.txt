H. of Reps.
firm that opposition, I entertain no doubt whatever,
that it has no sanction, either in the spirit or the
letter of the constitution Strongly committed,
then, to such opinions, and having uniformly acted
up to them in every time of trial, in the removal
of the deposites, through the panic era, and the
Executive veto, I am not to be freightened from
what I have taken as the path oí duty, by the new
born fears, even of s*? distinguished a proselyte
I distrust the quarter, «ir, whence the denuncia-
tion comes I have no confidence m that counsel
which springs fiom the zeal of recent conversion—
opinions that are hastily taken up, are as speedily
laid aside, and are worthy of no reliance whatever
No, sir, in my humble judgment the danger of
recurrence to a national bank, is to be looked for
m the very opposite quarter In the immature con-
ception and hurried execution of this sub-tieasury
scheme I do not mean to predict it, because I
would not be understood as disparaging the judg-
ment of tho^e who confide more readily than I do
But suppose they should fail, suppose it should be
found impracticable to carry out the new -scheme,
thatj the currency should grow worse, that bank
paper should continue irredeemable , and the peo-
ple become wearied out, with your rigid exaction
of «oin from them, while nothing but paper is paid
to them I ask you, and I put it to the serious con-
sideration of the country, what remedy would then
be found? You could not fall ba< k upon the State
banks They had just been divorced, and common
decency would forbid the new espousal Where then
would you find refuge 1 Why, sir, as was done
once before, m the arms of a nationa' bank, and
no where else
I am not at all answered in the objections thus
advanced, when I am told that my apprehensions
of this failure are without foundation You relied
as confidently when the public money was tians-
ferred to the State banks, that they would not fail
Every official report and every state paper was re-
plete with their commendation We were told that
they were equal to every emergency, in the fi cal
operations of the Government, and furnished its
best and safest reliance 4nd yet, within two
short years, the whole system is denounced as an
entire failure What belter assurance can you
give us now, than you offered then i
Why may not your new scheme fail"1 I believe
that it must, inevitably must, if attempted now
And when it does fail I can imagine no possible
resource left, but that which our new convert so
earnestly depiecates I pray you to excuse me,
then, if 1 do not see ■with his eyes
Sir, m attempting these sub treasurits now, the
Government, if I may so express it, is retreating to
the citadel at once, in the great battle with a na-
tional bank I see nothing but danger in the at-
tempt—opinions differ amongst your best and
ablest advisers, whether you can now make the
position good, and if you do not, there is no escape,
no choice, but in uncond tional surrender
One word more, sir, to the honorable member
from South Carolina, and to those to whom this
portion of his address is directed I understand
him as making an appeal to the democrats of the
north, to rally around this sub-treasury scheme, as
their surest and safest protect on against the op-
pression of northern capital sts He tells them
that they are looked upon as the natural allies of
the south, because their 'abor holds the same posi-
tion to capital in then country, that our slaves hold
to their owners at the south
How these northern democrats may relish the
doctrines of their new ally, I need venture no pre-
diction I doubt vi hether they can be otought to
rally around the standard of a leader, who denies
them any place, even m the commoa scale of hu-
manity
Is it upon principles such as Hese, that the
northern democracy is invoked to lend their aid to
the measures contemplated bj this bill' These
are they, I presume, who are appealed to m the
occasional addresses of certain newspaper, as the
" democracy of numbis," contradistinguished we
find now from any democracy of men—who hold no
place m the thinking, acting part of the community,
bat are classed as mere dead weight, to be thrown
at will into eithei scale of Ihe political balance
If there be any such party in our favored land,
I thank Heaven that it is unknown in the quarter
of the country from whence I come We have
there, sir, I am proud to say, as hon°st and s*urdy
a race of democrats as ever the sun shone upon
Of intelligent, thinking, independent, and free men,
each doing and acting for himself in all questioai
of public interest Ha' ing perfect equality of
right, and participating to the fullest extent of a
free cittzen, m the d rection and control of all pub-
lic affairs
This, sir, is the character of the democracy with
which I am familiar, nor I apprehend are our true
northern democrats of a texture any whit infer or
But I desire my constituents at least to know to
what sort ot democracy the merits of this bill are
addressed by its friends Not to intelligent and
thinking men, but to a diss who are counted
only by their numbers, and are estimated to have
no influence in public affairs, save as a mass,
holding a certain position toward capital
[Mr Pickens here asked the floor, and was un-
derstood to say, that he did not laj down the pro-
position as broadl) as v as stated by Mr Mason
He meant only to say, that the tendency of the in-
stitutions at the north w as lo organize capital, and
to make labor tributary to it, and unless such ten-
dency weie checked, would finally reduce labor
there to a s'ate of vassalage ]
Having thus given my objections to tnp passage
of any law at this time, which has not for one of
its principal objects a reformation of the currencj,
or, I should more properly say, which will not by
us operation, lead back the banks fo a resumption
of payment, I proceed briefly to suggest what my
opinions are of the ultimate attitude which the
Government should assume to vards these institu-
tion^ I have no expectation or belief, notw th-
standmg the cry which has been raised against tie
banks, through the press and otherwise, thatby anv
action of this Government these institutions can be
destroyed It is not in your powei to do so, sir, if
you would and, if attempted by an> means, direct
or induect, every effort that you could make, would
eventuate in defeat They are created by the
States—are incorporated, and have life given to
them by then separate law—for their bem^ they
lean upon the Stites, and are as entirely indepen-
dent of }on, as you can ever become of them
Most ot the States have a large monejed interest
in their stock, and participate largely in their man-
agement by the immediate appointment of dnec-
k ors.
Vnginia has an immense fund invested m her
banks, the income from which is appropriated to
education, to internal improvement, and to other
favorite objects of her State policy Besides all
which the banks of each State furnish to each the
entire paper circulation w ithin its borders—a source
of proBt in w hich the States themselves largelv
part c pate For good or for ill then, these banks
are si closely interwoven now, mall their relations
with State interests, that the) cannot be eiadicated,
even bv the pow er upon wh'ch they depend for e\-
ístence
They enter laigely into, and influence to a great
extent, all the elements which affect the trade of
the country, and thus, whether you are connecte d
with, or divorced fiom them, whenever irade
or the course of exchange (in which the) largely
e'eal) is deranged or injured, )our fmarces will le
immediate!) affec ed You may be divo ced from
them a mensa, and a vmculis, and shou'd a period
ever occur again, when there is a general suspen
sion of specie pa)ment, your treasur) -Kill stop
payment in unison with the banks, precisely as it
h s done now , and the only diffeience between \ou
will be, that they w ill stop pa) ment as a measu e
of precaution, and )ou from necessit\
I say, then, emphatically,that th= present embar-
rassed condition c f the treasury is not ow mg to its
connexion with the banks You ha-ve not ira
money enough to the credit of the Government m
all the banks north of the Potomac put togetner,
(the quarter where the principal revenue is col-
lected,) to cairy on the Government for two weeks
The treasur) is. w ithout money , not because the
banks have stopped payment, but because Us sup-
plies are cut off    Its revenue is stagnant m the
hands of its oebiors, and not in the vaults of the
banks Tnere i-, money enough die to you, but
yoa can t get it in, and so it is precisely with the
banl s 'It ou and they are both obliged, being op-
erated upon b) tie same causes, to give time to
your debtors, and to wait for the reaction of trade,
the revival of commerce, before )ou can again get
afloat
Neither is this reasoning at all weakened by the
fact, that you have some five or s x millions yet on
deposite, in the southern and western States, which
is styled "unavailable"—meaning that you can't
command it for i,se You can't command it, simply
because you have no use for i  in the place where it
is In th" northern and eastern States, where >ou had
use fir monej, you ha\ e withdrawn it rapidly since
the suspension, md so you would have done, from
those south and west, could )ou have used the
money at the place where it was Suppose then,
that this mone), instead of bemg on deposite in the
banks, was loosed tip m sub-treasuries in gold and
silver Fu e or six millions of bullion, is too large
a sum to be su Idcnly transferred from one quarter
of th" countr) to the other, v ithout producing very
serious etTtcis upon tne tiadi. aud ousmess of those
places w hence it is taken, and )tt you w ould have
no other resource whatever, in order to make it
" available," but to br ng it away in bulk, trans-
porting it at heav v cost across the countr) , fiom
the place where it was collected to the place where
it was wan'ed
You could not command a dolhr b) means of
exenange , for ihe v t\ ct uses that now make )our
depo ite " unavailable" ther , hasrmup exchange
to rather more than the expenses of transportation.
And thus that whole tumi, even if now in gold and
sih er, and m sub trcasunes, to boot, would be just
as una\ ¿liable to Go\ eminent, m the present con-
dition of the counti) , as tnen dep >site i=, in the
bail s men ion d Government w ould not at-
tempt t br ng awa_> ti e metal The country
would not alio v itself to le thus diamed—or if it
were done, the very operation would open the peo-
ple's e)es to the working of the machmeiy, and all
wou'd cry out against it No, sir, if tins whole
" unavailable fund" in the south and w est, were
now locked up there m gold ai d silver, sooner than
encounter the cost and nsk of transportation, and
the clamor that w ould be raised against it in those
States, ve sloukl go quie ly to woik, as we aie
now do r g, ardissue ti-asur) note* to answ er in its
piare, unt I the restoiation of trade to its accus-
tomed channels would allow its being made avail-
able, D) the u«e of bills of exchange
Treating the banks, then, as the\ certainiy are,
institutions dependant for their being upon the
Sta es alone, and yet exerc sing so important an
influence upon tie trade and business ot the coun-
try, it becomts us next to inquire what is the best
and safest relation m which ihe Government can
place itself tov a d them, to avo d, as far as may
b°, a íecurience ot tre e lis under which we now
