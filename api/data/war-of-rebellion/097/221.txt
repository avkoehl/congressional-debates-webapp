Associated Press, I learn has also gone. They have with them copy of General Orders, Numbers 13, congratulating the army on affair of 25th of March. General Meade recalled the order last night in time to prevent its general distribution. I telegraphed then to City Point to Driscoll, and just received an answer that he cannot be found. I cannot find McGregor. It is important that the order should not get into the papers. Will you please have the editors of the Tribune. Herald, Times, Chronicle, and Associated Press instructed to suppress it. Please answer.
