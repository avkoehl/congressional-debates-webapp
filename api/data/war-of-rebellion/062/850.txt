I have the honor to state that Captain Howe, with his engineer troop, is engaged in constructing the bridge at Hinkle's Ferry. He reports that he has been informed by Captain Heermann that he has ordered to be sent to him through Captain Ransom certain materials, among other things (which have been received) 2 kegs of spikes and 12 chalk-lines, which last have not been received. Captain Ransom has not received these articles. Captain Heermann also sent to Houston for 2 kegs 20-penny nails, 4 kegs tar, 500 kegs oakum, 6 sets caking tools to construct the bridges.

Nothing has been heard of these articles; they are reported by him to be greatly needed. Please forward these articles at once through Mr. Wiggins to Captain Ransom; I will have them sent to him at once by Captain Ransom.

The general is too well aware of the great importance of the speedy completion of these bridges for me to say that much embarrassment might arise from being retarded by the want of necessary materials and tools. I have directed Captain Howe to send a man to hurry them forward. The work progresses alarmingly slow. Please advise me beforehand of the general's return, in order that the ambulances may meet him and no difficulty arise.
