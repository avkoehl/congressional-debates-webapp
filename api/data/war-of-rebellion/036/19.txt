Near Vicksburg, MISS.:

GENERAL: There is a vacant major-generally in the Regular Army, and I am authorized to say that it will be given to the general in the field who first wins an important and decisive victory.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Major-General GRANT,

Near Vicksburg, MISS.:

It is of great importance that transports be returned from your command as far as it possible; otherwise you will be short of supplies. Steam vessels on the upper rivers are very scarce. Vessels on the river between Memphis and Vicksburg should go in fleets, under convoy. Make requisition on Admiral Porter for convoys. The unnecessary detention of transports down the Mississippi River is a matter of the most serious importance, and requires your immediate attention.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I telegraphed you yesterday the near approach to completion of the canal. The water is extremely high; several feet above the highest ground inside the levee. Last night one of the dams across the upper end of the canal gave way, filling up where men were at work getting out stumps, and thus setting back the work for several days. I hope yet, however, to have this work completed as early as I could possibly take advantage of it if was already done.
