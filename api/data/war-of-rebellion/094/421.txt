HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Pulaski, December 30, 1864-9 p.m.

Brigadier General ANDREW JOHNSON,

Military Governor of Tennessee, Nashville:

As the enemy is now entirely driven out of the State of Tennessee, I would respectfully suggest that immediately me assures be taken for the reorganization of the civil government of the State, as it is desirable, it possible, to place as force of the army beyond the borders of the State and as close to the enemy as we can, and I should be very happy to be assured that I could leave the State in the hands of the citizens. All should certainly now feel that the establishment of rebel authority in the State of Tennessee is hopeless, and their own interests should induce them to return to their allegiance to the United States, and restore peace to their State without any further quibbling.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Pulaski, December 30, 1864
