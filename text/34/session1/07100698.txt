APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBS.
[June 20,
34th Cong....1st Sess. Admission of Kansas—Mr. Bennett, of New York.
Ho. of Reps.
which the slaveholding section have gained polit-
ically (and that is the all important object) ten
United States Senators and sixteen members of this
House! i
California, it is true, has been admitted as a free
State; but it was the result of accident. The ter-
ritory acquired of Mexico, like all the rest, was
acquired for the benefit of the South. The dis-
covery of the mineral wealth of California led to
its rapid settlement and admission as a State,
before slavery had time to be transplanted there.
The Senators and members from California have
learned in whose hands the power of this Gov-
ernment is held, and have ever been, and now are,
politically, the faithful allies of the South! They
nave ever been, they are now, of the pro-slavery
party. And in the account I am stating between
freedom and slavery, California should be wholly
omitted, as it forms no part of the territory where
the struggle for and against the extension of slavery
has been carried on. Omitting, then, California
on either side of the account,! proceed:
Out of all the territory purchased since the Con-
stitution was adopted, how many free States have
been admitted ? None !
How many Senators hare the free States gained
by the large expenditure of blood and treasure
they have made ? None.'
How many Representatives ? None ! no, none !
not one inch of territory, not one solitary mem-
ber in either branch of the National Legislature!
Mr. Clay admitted this, in his speech made in
the Senate in 1850. (See Appendix to Globe,
vol. 22, part 1, page 126.) He said:
" What have been the acquisitions made by this country,
and to what interests have they conduced ? Florida, where
slavery exists, has been introduced. All the most valuable
part of Louisiana has also been added to the extent and
consideration of the slaveholding portion of the Union.
" All Louisiana, with the exception of what lies north of
36° ay.
'■All Texas; all the Territories which have been acquired
by the Government, during sixty years of the operation of
that Government, have been slave Territories; theaters of
slavery, with the exception I have mentioned lyins north
of 36° 30 . 
It is no longer an exception! Even there sla-
very was admitted by the last Congress.
But were the free States to receive no part of
the purchased Territories ? Yes. The South made
a division, by which the free States were promised
that part of the Louisiana Territory lying north
of 36° 30*, when, in the then distant future, it
might be settled. But when, more than thirty
years afterwards, that time came, the slaveholders
abused the power which the free States had given
them, by this addition of ten Senators and six-
teen Representatives, and violated every principle
of honesty and good faith, by repealing that
pledge, and repudiating that promise—claiming
a perfect right to all they had obtained, and an
equally perfect right to take the rest, even that
small portion which was free, which they had
pledged to freedom. And the President and pro-
slavery party are now laboring to force slavery
upon Kansas, by outlawing and butchering the
citizens of Kansas opposed to slavery. Thus far
the fair division of the Territories, purchased and
paid for by all the States, has been—to the free
States, none ! to the slave States, all! But that
is not enough; even that comparatively valueless
part of the Louisiana purchase lying north of
the Missiouri compromise line, of which Mr.
Clay said, in 1850, " In point of intrinsic value
and importance, I would not give the single State
of Louisiana for the whole of it," is demanded
by the aggressive spirit and sectional interest of
slavery.
To this the free States never can consent.
Kansas and Nebraska never should, and never
can, be admitted as slave States. Never. Do
not increase the evils that are upon us, and
protract this controversy in that vain hope. It
never can be realized. The question is not now
as it was in the beginning. But for these great
additions of territory, which the free States
aided to purchase; but for these new slave States
formed out of the added territory, which the free
States aided to admit; but for the votes of the
Senators and Representatives from these very
States, thus acquired and thtis admitted, this
great wrong of opening the free Territories to
slavery*-a wrong against the political and equal
rights of the free States—could never have been
committed. Without the aid of the votes of the
new slave States, the slave power could not have
violated the compact of 1820. Our past experi-
ence can never be forgotten. The day of com-
promises is passed. We have learned that the
slave power aims at supremacy—absolute suprem-
acy in this Government; that it is ever aggressive,
insolent, and exacting; that it abides by no com-
pact, fulfills no promise, regards no obstacle, but,
true to one instinct, its love of dominion, seeks
to secure the whole power of this Government
in its grasp. It seeks to destroy the political
rights of the free States, to trample under its feet
every principle of equality and of republicanism,
and build up its own power upon their ruins.
Against this perversion and destruction of the
very principles ofthis Government, the free States
here, and now, have taken their stand, seeking
only to bring back the Government to the true
republican standard qf equal representation and
equal rights.
The great question now is "the extension or
non-extension of slavery"—its extension into free
territory, and then its extension into the free
States, for one is the same as the other. " It con-
trols the South. It controls the North. It pre-
cludes escape." So say the pro-slavery papers.
True. It cannot be avoided or evaded. We are
compelled to meet it, whether we would choose,
or whether we would forbear. On this question
there are but two parties—those who are for the
extension of slavery into the free Territories, and
those who are against it. It is the great question,
before which all others sink into insignificance.
Are we to have a government of the people, a
real representative Republican Government? or
axe the owners of slave property, small in num-
ber, but with the power now in their hands, and
strongly intrenched in every department, to rule
us with arbitrary and undisputed sway? Is this
to be a land of freedom, or a despotism of sla-
very? Is such a despotism, more odious than
any that can be found in history, to be now firmly
fixed upon us by a system of fraud and force—
by high-handed acts of wrong, outrage, and vio-
lence? Shall Freedom, Democracy, and Repub-
licanism, be crushed down by the despotic rule of
slavery ? Shall one interest, one section, one insti-
tution, be made, absolutely, the ruling power ? or
are all interests to be alike represented and alike
protected ? It is a question not only for the pres-
ent, but for all future time! Let freemen judge!
Are you for or against the extension of slavery ?
This is the question—the great question, to be
settled at the next Presidential election! *9re
you for or against the extensionist of slavery into free
territory? For slavery, or for freedom ?

Territory.
Fifteen slave States contain 998,804 square miles.
Fifteen free States "  454,344 *' «
Difference 474,550 « «
The fifteen slave States contain more than
double the territory of the fifteen free States.
In other words, the slave States now have about
five times the extent of territory, according to popula-
tion, that the free States have; including slaves and
all, they have about three times the territory of
the free States, according to population! Yet,
they would still encroach upon free territory.
They still demand more for slavery.
Nine slave States have been added, con-
taining 722,922 square miles.
Six free States have been added,
containing 290,264 " «
Difference 332,658 - «
Maine and Vermont were formed by dividing
old States, and not from added territory. While
the free States have more than doubled the pop-
ulation, the slave States have gained more than
double the territory, by the admission of new
States. That is, the addition made (by the ad-
mission of new States) to the limits of slavery is
about five times in extent to the addition made to
the free States, in proportion to numbers.
The five purchased slave States of Florida,
Texas, Arkansas, Louisiana, and Missouri, con-
tain 543,369 square miles.
The whole fifteen free States contain 454,344
square miles.
The territory added to the slave States by pur-
chase, is larger than all the fifteen free States, by
89,025 square miles.
This excess is a larger territory than is con-
tained in seven of the free States. Jlnd this was
all purchased to extend slavery; while the free States
admitted have been formed out of territory be-
longing to the United States when the Govern-
ment was established, and to which the ordinance
of Jefferson and of freedom, prohibiting slavery,
was applied by the fathers of the RepuDiic.
When so much has been yielded to slavery,
will southern Representatives object to admitting
one free State out of all the purchased territory ?
Representation. .
The fifteen free States have 13,000,000 of
free white inhabitants; the fifteen slave States
6,000,000; yet each have thirty Senators. True,
the small States are entitled to two Senators each,
as well as the larger ones; but this number of
slave States, extended over a large territory, with
a small population, makes the disproportioned
representation of the two sections in the Senate
too palpably unjust. In Senators, the slave States
have, by this system, kept up a representation, in the
proportion of two to one, as against the free States.
In the House, the slave States have ninety
members, representing 6,000,000 of population;
the free States,one hundred and forty-two mem-
bers, representing 13,000,000. Upon the same
ratio with the slave States, the free States should
have one hundred and ninety-five members—a loss to
them qf fifty-three—in the popular branch of the
Government; that in which the popular voice is to
be heard, and the popular will expressed.
South Carolina lias six Representatives, with a
free white population of 274,563.
New Hampshire has three Representatives,
with a free white population of 317,456.
Vermont has three Representatives, with a free
white population of 313,402.
Vermont and New Hampshire, with a popula-
tion of 630,858, have six Representatives.
South Carolina has six also, with only 274,563;
less, by 356,295—not one half as much.
At the ratio of South Carolina representation,
these free States should have fourteen Represent-
atives, instead of six. Is there not a wide dif-
ference in the political rights of these States. My
district has a population of over 100,000; the ratio
of South Carolina is about 45,000; that would
