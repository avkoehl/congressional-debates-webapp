General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON:

GENERAL: Inclosed you will find a copy of a letter just received from General Jones+ and my reply, which are respectfully submitted for your information and consideration.

General Pegram has not yet set out on his expedition, having been detained by high water. Since issuing my orders to General Marshall to prepare so much of his cavalry force as he could spare for the joint expedition from General Jones' command and mine into Kentucky, I have not heard one word from him upon the subject. What degree of readiness his part of the combined force is in, I am therefore unable to inform you.

I am, general, with the greatest respect, your obedient servant,

D. S. DONELSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE,Knoxville, March 1, 1863.

Major-General [SAMUEL] JONES:

GENERAL: Inasmuch as the expedition contemplated in my last letter to you was to be entirely composed of cavalry, I supposed the ranking cavalry officer from your command would take charge of it.
