Major-General GRANGER,

Commanding Thirteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I am with my command at D'Olive's Creek, about two miles from Spanish Fort and half a mile from the bay. The road in my rear is very good. From information that I have received I think I can go ahead. I do not believe they will show fight at the fort. The forces in our front are considerably less than was anticipated. I am ready to move and awaiting orders. The signal officers with me are trying to communicate with the fleet. Communication with the fleet is open. A boat from the fleet is just landing.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
