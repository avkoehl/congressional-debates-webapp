[CHAP. XLIII.

NASHVILLE, December 20, 1863-11.30 a.m.

Brigadier General GEORGE CROOK,

Commanding Second Cavalry Division, Huntsville:

Move your command at the earliest possible moment to Prospect, and cross it over the Elk River, leaving a small garrison at such points as you deem necessary, with orders to follow and join as soon as relieved by other troops. March your dismounted men and we will endeavor to furnish horses to mount them. I hope to be able to ad eight or ten regiments to your command to supply the place of those detached.

These regiments will move to Columbia immediately and join you at some convenient point. Advise me promptly of your movements.

Brigadier-General, Chief of Cavalry.

Major-General FOSTER,

Knoxville:

The high water in the Holston having rendered it impossible to push upon the enemy's left flank with the cavalry for some days, much valuable time will be lost in waiting for the waters to recede. I would suggest that the cavalry be pushed up on the enemy's right flank so as to turn Rutledge, Bean's Station, Rogersville, &amp;c. If pushed it can always fall back in the direction of Tazewell and Cumberland Gap.

GORDON GRANGER,

Major-General, Commanding.
