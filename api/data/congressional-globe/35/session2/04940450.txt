January 19,
GRAND CHENIERE ISLAND. j
The SPEAKER stated that the business.fust ;
iu order was the motion made yesterday by Mr. !
Cobb, to recommit to the Committee on Public 1
Lands House bill (No. 683) recognizing thesnr- ,
vey of the Grand Cheniere Island, State of Louis- ;
iana, as approved by the surveyor general, and i
for other purposes. ,
Mr. COBB. I withdraw the motion to rccom- !
mit3 and ask that the bul be read. The House j
will see that it ought to pass. [
The bill was read. It provides that the anom- j
alous survey of the Grand Chcnicre Island, in the
southwest district of Louisiana, as approved by 1
R.W.Boyd, surveyor general, be confirmed, and '
that the people residing thereon at the date of this .
act, and who according to the preemption laws ;
now in force-would be entitled to a preemption, ]
shall be allowed such ri^ht on the lands referred i
to; bu.t such right shall be confined to the subdi- j
vision of land upon which the parties reside, and
shall exceed in no case one hundred and sixty
acres.
Mr. COBB. The object of this hill is to pro- !
vide for ahttle strip of land surrounded by swamps
which cannot be surveyed in the usual manner— :
north, south, east, and west. T{eu: is a map of :
it,from which gentlemen will see that it can only ;
be surveyed by being cut up mto little fragments !
of from forty to one hundred ami thirty acivs. ;
Mr, HOUSTON. My colleague speaks of tfiis -
land asaswomp. I would like him to stat<f whether ,
this bill conflicts with the swamp land act. 1
Mr. COBB. Not at ail 1 did not state that;
the land whs swamp, but th.it it was surrounded
by swamps. :
The bill was ordeied to be nngro^scd and ivnd ,
a third tune- and, ln"ir engrossed, it was an ord-
ingly rend the thnd time, and passed . ,
Air. COHC moved to recous'doi the vote by)
which the bill v.as passed,and also moved to lay'
the motion to reconsider upon the table. i
The latter motion way agteed to.
MOBILE AND OHIO RAILROAD. j
Mr. COBH, from the Committee <>n Pubbc '
Lands, reported back, with en amendment:, I louse i
bill (No. 6011) for the ivhefof the Mobile and Oiuo
Railroad Co!n()anv. The hill enacts that whereas
the State of i\t ississippi, by its act approved
January 2^, 185*2, and the State of Alabama, by
its act approved Decetubei I, 1851, did transfer ;
to the Mobile and Ohio Uailroad (Company the ,
lands granted to said States under the piovnuons |
of the act of Congress, approved September ;]Q, :
1850, to aid in the construction ol' a railroad from ,
Mobile to the mouth of the Ohio nvor, the hanx-
fer of the lands made by the said States to the said
company aie hei.-by recognisedratified, and con-
firmed; and tin' bul also extend* the tune gia.ded
by the act o[ Congress to the said company to
complete the toad, to Septetubei, Lb'o.
Tiie Commute" on Public Lands imported ftn
amendment io the bill, to insut, after the wo:d
"confirmed," the words "and the tlijes to ail
l/QtiujUle\)iu chasers of said company are uLo here-
by confirmed." i
Mr. CODli. I will state the objects of that lull
ns briefly as possible, a.$ if, is my d"snv to facili-
tate business, and not to consume the time of the j
House by unnecessary remarks. !
In the year 1800, the Congress ol' the United ,
States made a grant of lands to the Siao s of Mis-
sissippi and Alabama, to aid in the cmufrii'Uion ,
of a railroad connecting Mobile with Chicago.
The Legislature of Mism -sip;)! and Alal 'am a v  i of
on and gave the lands to ihi^ uimpmiy on j 'ae con-
dition that th< y should htrhl th*> load. A <;ie>s-
tion arof-m .Mi ^"i-yippi, wiil mi, a.- 1 mm leW-md, ;
brings this Lull here. Some eorot in Mi^sis^ip.a .
decided that tlie Lei:,, ieuuv o, that Slate eoulil ,
not vest the nib"- i,i the lv-hovl com;.' ny. Tl vv 1
therefore decided to «-otii   hi.\ ami a-d; CoivjreoS
to confirm the gs out oi the land by t h" Legislature.
I do not think any man in t.'is Ii(U;se would ■
tolerate such a decision as has ! e: n m, do in ih,^
case fora moment. Tap gram vf Led was made to
the State, dear and distinct, .aid they had the n
to give up the lahd. to the company upon the con- !
dition that they should build the road. Underth's |
grant, the company have gone oo and completed i
a large poition of the read which is to form the 1
connecting link between Mobile and Chicago. I j
have no doubt that ilie grant was perfectly valid. I
Still, irj order to avoid all difficulty, it has been i
thought best to have it confirmed by Congress. 1
1 carc nothing about the extension of time which :
the bill profit s for, I have no doubt myself i
that the company will be able to complete the I
road within the yu;r; hut I presume there wiU be ;
no objection to the extension which is provided j
for. The committee* have decided that it should |
be made to provide against ail contingencies. I
do not regard the amendment which has been re- |
ported ms of any consequence, believing that the f
grants made by the company would be confirmed 1
by the courts; but I hppe the House will pass the j
bill, and allow us to pass to other business, f call;
the previous question upon the engrossment of the >
bill. j
The previous question was seconded, and the j
main question ordered to be put.
The amendment reported by tho Committee on >
Public Lands was agreed to. j
The bill, ns amended, was ordered to be cn- j
grossed and rend a third time; and, being en- j
groped, it accordingly read the third time.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I call for the yeas
and nays upon the passage of the bill.
Mr. BAIIKS1>ALE. 1 call for tellers upon
ordering the yeas and hays.
Tellers were not ordered.
The yeas and nays weie ordered.
Mr. BARKSD ALE. lawk tho unanimous con-
sent of the IIois^c to make an explanation in re-
lation to this bill. 1 do not think it is understood
by the House.
Mr. MORGAN. I object;, for the reason that
I am opposed io this whole aifuir, and I should
want an opportunity to ioply.
Mr. BALKSDALE. There would be no op-
' position to this hill H it were umhusteod.
The SPEAKER. Debate is in onha, tho pio-
vious question not having been called on the pas-
sage of the lull.
Mr. BAitKSDALE. 1 was under the impres-
sion that tho previous question heal been called.
, In ]$r>0, Congress parsed an act making a grant
of ! md to the Stai'-s of Alabama and Mississippi,
to aid in the construction of the Mobile and Ohio
raihoyd. In the Legislatures of Mississippi
and Alabama p^sed acts conveying tlm kinds to
the company, and the company entered upon the
possession of it. A ponion of it has since been,
and is still, mortgaged; a portion of it has been
sold by the company, and a portion is still m their
poasi .-sion. Certain partk s m Mississippi became
trespassers upon the lands, and the county insti-
tuted suits ana-.ist, tlmm for tiespass. Upon the
t-ml of thin case the circuit judge in Mississippi
deeided that the trnnsf-u* of the lands by the L^-
'4;,*l,iiun! "ow jlleval ami void, and that the suit
t. -mid no' r>o m unfaiu-'d.

,-a\ So to pass an act confumini; the transfei which
has been mad'- by t!:e Legislature. If the bill is not

of the company wd! be  cuously impaired, and ;
th.it the p..tues wh<"> have purchased lands of the 1
company, or who have moitgaires upon then!,

Mr. N1 CIrOLS. Will the gentleman allow me
to ask him a que>'tmn }
Mr. \j MUCSOALE. T do not think it ne^ s- ,
save to u.aheaoy further explanation of the bdl.
?.lr. xiiCL'OLS. I merely wanted to ask what
was the around of the thciston of tho court to
v/litoh the gemieman has referred ? !
Mr. IlAUkS:J\LL. I liavo not that decision :
b.rtore me, and I do not know the preci.se grounds .
of tin- d'-eisjon. L was made, ho a ever, by an
« • bghLjued judge; an.l 1 umhustaad that the trans j
Legiohituie was pronounced ilieged and ■
tu-'-e it was noc la aeeoidanee with th.e !
t,.rms uj'th • errant made by Congress. !
7ui. MOilO I w.int to ask another ques-
tion or two. i v. auL to know what amount of land <
was granted; what is the length of the road; how ]
much of it has been completed; and what extent |
of time this bill provides the grant to run beyond ;
that in the original act? I
f by the
void, her-;
Mr. I3AR.KSDALE. I cannot g^o the perti-
nency of the questions asked by the gentleman
from New York, but I will answer them with
pleasure, so far as I am able to do so. I under-
stand that about eleven handled thousand acres
of land was originally 'granted to the States of
Alabama and Mississippi to aid in the construc-
tion of this road. My colleague, [Mr. McRae,]
who is one of the directors of that road, will
answer how much of the road has been con-
structed.
Mr. McRAE. With the permission of my
colleague, I will answer the questions of the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. Morgan.] This
grant of Congress was similar to al! the other rail-
road grants. The grant made to the State of Mis-
sissippi, for the construction of the Mobile and
Ohio railroad, gave alternate sections within six
miles of the road, with the privilege, where the
land had been previously sold, or otherwise dis-
posed of, to go out nine miles beyond the six to
make up any deficiency.
Mr. MORGAN. Will the gentleman allow me
to interrupt him a moment. My object is to
know whether the company are going on in good
faith to build this road ? -
Mr.BARKSDALE. They are. TlSy.arc at
work on the road now.
Mr. McRAE. I will say in answer to-the gen-
tleman's question, that two hundred and thirty-
eight miles of tho road are completed at the lower
end, from Mobile through the State of Missis-
sippi; that about eighty miles are completed in
the State of Tennessee; that the company are
pursuing the work oneigetically; that they have
contracted for the iron necessary for the entire
completion of the road; and that they believe
they will have it completed within the time lim-
ited by the act of Congress for its construction.
There is, perhaps, a doubt on that subject, and
therefore they ask for an extension of tli£ time.
Mr. NICHOLS. I wish to ask one other
question of the gentleman now upon the floor.
I ask whether this bill is intended to accomplish
anything ntore than to confirm the act of the
State Legislature ?
Mr^ BAIIIvSDALE. Nothing more than that.
'Mr. NICHOLS. That was not befoie under-
stood.
Mr. Pj VIIKSDALE. I call for the previous
question on the passige of the bill.
The previous question was seconded, and the
mam question ordeied to be put.
The question was taken; and it was decided in
the affirmative—yeas 135, nays 3£: as follows:
