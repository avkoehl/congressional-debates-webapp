MURFREESBOROUGH, TENN., December 31, 1862.

We assailed the enemy at 7 o'clock this morning, and after ten hours' hard fighting have driven him from every position except his extreme left, which [were] he has successfully resisted us. With the exception of this point, we occupy the whole field. We captured 4,000 prisoners, including 2 brigadier-generals, 31 pieces of artillery, and some 200 wagons and teams.* Our loss is heavy; that of the enemy much greater.

MURFREESBOROUGH, January 3, 1863.

(Received January 4, 1863.)

The enemy retired last night but a short distance to intrenchments in his rear. In a sharp and short contest this evening we drove his left flank from position, but our assaulting party again retired with considerable loss to both sides. Wheeler and Wharton were again in their rear yesterday; captured 200 prisoners, one piece of artillery, and destroyed 200 loaded wagons.

Adjutant and Inspector General.

TULLAHOMA, January 5, 1863.

Unable to dislodge the enemy from his intrenched position, and learning of re-enforcements to him, I withdrew from his front night before last; he has not followed; my cavalry is still close in his front.

General S. COOPER,

DECHERD, January 6, 1863.

Enemy have not yet followed us in force. My command is now concentrated on line of Elk Run. From papers captured on the field, their force was from 60,000 to 70,000; ours not over half that. We hope to check any advance; but to save East Tennessee, and enable us to advance again, re-enforcements are necessary. They are bringing forward every man from Kentucky.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

DECHERD, January 7, 1863.

We shall hold line of Duck River, if possible. Our losses will reach 9,000; the enemy has not advanced from Murfreesborough.

BRAXTON BRAGG.

General S. COOPER.
