HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 10, 1865. (Received 10 a. m.)

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The following changes in my command since yesterday morning: That part of the First Division holding from Fort Fisher to Fort Gregg were relieved by troops of the Sixth Corps yesterday morning, and the First and Third Divisions were placed upon the new line, from Fort Gregg to the crossing of Hatcher's Run by the Vaughan road, the Second Division remaining in position near Armstrong's Mill. The intrenched line was put in defensible condition as far as the battery near the Tucker house.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,February 10, 1865-10.30 a. m.

Major-General WEBB:

I presume that under the amended order defining the new line of intrenchments to the crossing of Hatcher's Run by the Vaughan road, I am to hold half-way between the battery near the Tucker house and the crossing and the picket to Hatcher's Run. I propose to have the picket-line on my left watch the Dancan road from the R. Armstrong house to its crossing of Hatcher's Run, and to be posted on the west side of the little swamp running north and south in that vicinity.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 10, 1865-11.10 a. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

You are to hold to the crossing of Vaughan road and Hatcher's Run. General Warren holds the crossing and the works at that point. His picket west of the stream is to connect with the left of your line.

ALEX S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,February 10, 1865-4.30 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

General Meade desires to know whether you have an old reliable brigade, numbering not over 1,000 or 1,200 men, to go North on temporary duty. The most reliable officers and men are needed. Please designate the brigade, if you have such.

GEO. D. RUGGLES,
