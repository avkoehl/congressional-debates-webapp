In case the Left Wing should use the river road after passing Cox's Bridge General Logan will cross Falling Creek near Grantham's house, and will see that the crossing at that point is put in repair. These headquarters will move with the Seventeenth Army Corps and be established to-morrow at the school-house near Falling Creek.
