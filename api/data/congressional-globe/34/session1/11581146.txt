■jMniiirion of Kansas^-Mr. Walcetiian.
Ho. of Reps.
On the other hand, the measure received the
ardent support of such Democrats as Benton,
Buchanan, Linn, Silas Wright, Grundy, Niles,
ar.& William R. King. Indeed, Mr. Buchanan
made an elaborate argument in defense of the
spontaneous convention, and the rights'of the
people to be admitted as a State, in the cotirse of
which he said:
it wore necessary to place, the claims of Michigan
upon other grounds, it might be done with gredt force.
Suppose we wore to admit that their proceedings-had been
rregular: ought thai to exclude her from the.UmOft? Ob
this subject we ought to act like statesmen acquainted with
the history of our own couutry. We ought not to apply the
rigid rules' of abstract political science too rigorously to
Each cases. It has been our practice fc?retotbre to treat
our infant Territories with parental care? to nurse them
with kindness, and, when tliey had attained the age of
■nanhood. to admit them into the family without requiring
from there a rigid adherence to forms. The great questions
to be decided are, do they contain a sufficient population ?
have they adopted a republican Constitution and are,they
willing to enter the Union upon the terms which we pro-
pose ? If so, all the preliminary proceedings have been
considered but mere forms, which we have waived in re-
peated instances."
In the course of the same debate, Mr. Benton
said:
" The people there had held a convention, by their Own
power, to accept a fundamental condition of their admis-
sion into the Union. They have accepted the condition j
and the objection is, that the convention wsyf a lawless and
revolutionary mob, and that a law ought to be made to sup-
press and punish such assemblages in future.' Mr. B. would
hold a proposition for such a law to be the quintessence,
not of European, but of Asiatic despotism; and sure he was
it would receive no countenance by the vote of this Cham-
ber. In saying this, he spoke upon a recolleetion of the
past, as weU as upon a view of the present. Atlhe last ses-
sion of Congress, all this denunciation of lawless and revolu-
tionary mobs had been lavished upon the conventions, both
of Arkansas and Michigan, because, being Territories, they
bad held conventions, and framed constitutions, without
the authority of Congress. Our answer to these denuncia-
tions were the same that we give now, namely: 1. That
they had a right to do so without our authority, and all that
we could require was, that they should send us their con-
stitutions, that we might see they were republican'; and, 2.
That these Territories had several times applied to (longresB
for an act to regulate the holding of their conventions,
which were always refused by the political party which then
held the supremacy in this Chamber; and that to refuse
them an act to regulate the iholding of a convention, when
they asked for it, and then to denounce them for holding a
convention without law, was unreasonable and contradict-
ory, and subjected ourselves to the reproach both of injus-
tice and inconsistency. These were our answers then;
arid, we added, that those who denounced (he Arkansas
and Michigan conventions as lawless and' revolutionary
mobs, would find themselves unsupported by the vote of
the Senate!"
This great debate resulted in a complete vindi-
cation of the potcer of the people* spontaneously,
and without any previous provision of law, to
assemble together and accept and, ratify a fun-
damental condition of their admission into the
Union. On the final passage of the bill, in a
strong Democratic Senate, the vote stood—yeas
25, nays 10.
In the House, the measure was sustained by the
same line of argument, and secured the support
of 'Such Democrats as Boyd, C. C. Cambreleng,
Dromgoole, Fairfield, Haynes, Richard M.John-
son, Abijah Mann, Cave Johnson, Vanderpoel,
Franklin Pierce, Isaac Toueey, and Shields—and
on ordering the bill to a third reading, the vote
stood—yeas 148, nays 58; and a reference to the
record will show Franklin Pierce recorded in the,
affirmative. And yet, sir, when the people of
Kansas, by spontaneous action, form a State
Constitution and apply for admission into the
Union, this same Franklin Pierce, James Buch-
anan, & Co., tell us that such a proceeding is
absolutely revolutionary, and without " practice
or precedent" under the Constitution. •
Sir, the right of the people to self-government
is inherent and inalienable. Sixty years ago,
under the administration of Washington, uie
people of the Territory south of the Ohio, upon
their own mere motion, acting upon this great
fundamental principle, formed a constitution and
State government, and applied for admission, and
were received into the Union. Upon this prece-
dent, and basing their action upon this broad prin-
ciple, the Andrew Jackson Democrats of 1836
received Michigan into the Union; and these pre-
cedents, and the same principle, are now sought
to be extended to the people of Kansas by all true
Democrats in 1856. To-day, sir, Kansas is
knocking at your door for admission into the
Union. She has formed a State constitution,
with the approval and assent of a decided major-
ity of her citizen?. She has elected her Repre-
sentatives, and has clothed herself with all the
paraphernalia of a State, and now only awaits
your approval to enter upon the condition of a
sovereign member of the Union. But, sir, your
Pierces, and your Buchanans, and your T outers,
forgetful of the kind paternal care which they
insisted should be extended to our'noble sister
States^ Michigan and Arkansas, nowhidely thrust
away our youthful, yet noble and adventurous
daughter of the West, and leave her environed
with all the difficulties of her most unhappy and
trying condition.
" 4. But, Mr. Speaker, it is again insisted that
Kansas should be rejected, because her popula-
tion is less than ninety-three thousand four hun-
dred and twenty, the present ratio of represent-
ation.
By the Constitution'Representatives are ap'
portioned among the several States which may
be included within the Union, according to their
respective numbers of free persons, excluding
Indians not' taxied, and including three fifths of
all other persons. The number of Represent-
atives shall not exceed one for every thirty thou-
sand; but each State shall have at least one Repre-
sentative and two Senators. These are the only
constitutional provisions affecting the question
under consideration, and they in nowise restrict
the power of Congress over it. That the equal-
ity of representation should be preserved ie con-
ceded to be important. " Equality is equity,"
and, as far as practicable, should be preserved.
But the political history of the country shows
that, in the organization of the Senate at the
adoption of the Constitution, it was entirely
abandoned. And in the organization of the'House
of Representatives, the instances of departure
from, the principle are numerous. The Senate
representation is always the same','whatever may
be the inequality in the population. The follow-
ing table, from the report of the Committee on
Territories, will affordimportantinformation upon
this jpoint. It is as follows:

Number of Representa- 1
tives in Congress at the
time of admission.
A slight examination of this statement affords
glaring instances of the inequality of representa-
tion.
By the twenty-fifth section of the act of 1850,
providing for the seventh census and the fixing
of the number of members of the House of Rep-
resentatives, it was provided that the aggregate
representative population of the United States
should be divided by the number 233. And the
quotient of such a division, rejecting fractions,
Bhould be the new ratio of representation. Thus
93,420, being the quotient, was established as the
ratio. The, same section further provided that
the loss in the number of members, caused by
the fractions remaining in the several States,
should be compensated for by assigning to the
States having the largest fractions, one additional
member each, so as to make the whole number of
Representatives 234. Thus South Carolina had a
fraction of 47,478, and, in consequence, received
one additional representative. The same with
Rhode Island, with a fraction of 54,137; Indiana
with a fraction of 54,346; Kentucky, with a frac-
tion of 57,349, and Massachusetts with a fraction
