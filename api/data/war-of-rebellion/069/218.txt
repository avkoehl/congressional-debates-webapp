HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 26, 1864-5 p.m.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs me to say that if your bridge requires any rifle-pits to protect a recrossing, he desires that you will look into the matter. He also desires that you will take such action as will prepare boughs, as you suggested, for the upper bridge, to be put on after dark, in order to facilitate the quiet movement of General Potter's infantry, should he cross at that bridge. That bridge be destroyed behind us. The pickets will be relieved by the corps officers of the day in time to get them across the river by daylight. Orders will issue before night concerning the movement.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-The destruction of the upper bridge should be the last thing-if possible delayed till near daylight.
