CUMBERLAND, May 28, 1864-9 p.m.

Major T. A. MEYSENBURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Martinsburg:

The following dispatch* just received in reply to mine asking Colonel Harris how he got the information that the rebels had gone from the Valley to join Lee.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, May 28, 1864. (Received 1.10 p.m.)

Brigadier General B. F. KELLEY:

I left Martinsburg last night. Colonel Cole is in Washington. He saw Stanton and the President; you can imagine for what purpose. Sullivan's reputation is not safe; look out for secret operations. I am fully posted. By the way, I hear it from good authority that General Butler is to be relieved.

Yours,

W. P. SMITH.

BEVERLY, May 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

Rebel forces nearly all gone from the Valley to re-enforce Lee. This is absolutely reliable.

T. M. HARRIS,

Colonel, Commanding.

CUMBERLAND, May 28, 1864-4.30 p.m.

Colonel T. M. HARRIS,

Beverly:

How did you learn that the enemy had left the Valley? Please give me all the particulars immediately.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

BEVERLY, May 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

My own scouts, who have been beyond Franklin, and General Hunter's scouts, who came through from Cedar Creek and arrived last night, concur in this statement. The rebel forces passed through Staunton on 21st, going to join Lee. Have written you the particulars. There is no doubt of its correctness.

T. M. HARRIS,

Colonel, Commanding.
