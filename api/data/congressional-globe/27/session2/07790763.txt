REPEAL OF THE BANKRUPT LA?/
Mr BENTON made bás prgirmsed motion ask-
ing leave to introduce a bifl to fepeal the bankrupt
act of 1841, and supporter} hisfmoticn in a sp°ech
el near t- o hours Hi* máüon was to repeal
the bill for unconstitutional!1!, leaving u in force
for coroplet rg c^sej roif depending under the
!imit?uon-, which would Mee it frr m uncrsum-
tioialky T'le points of unconstitutional y on
which he particularly dv,elt were- 1 The dis-
ehaige Irom debis tuihi ui the consent of cred tor« q
2. I he infringement t f the Sale insolveut laws
3 The abolition of hms under ¡be State law. He
undertook to show that the act was flamed upon
the English insolvent debtors EC of the 1 t of
George IV , and r«ad m-iny sections from ih?t
act lo piove th?t our bankiupt act was taken
from i', and thit our act wa«, consequently,
not a bankrupt syilem, but the Eighh in
solvent act, perverted to an abolition of deb's
He gave i il w and si vere examination to tin ar-
guments in favor ot the bill, especially Mr Web-
sttrS and disputed them both, on reason and au-
thority. He said their orject was an abolition of
(Vbts, ane' so avowed, and read extracts Irom Mr
Webstei's «pfech of 1840 to show it. That, to get
at this abolition of debts, it «as necessary to estab-
lish two mam positions- first, that insolvency and
bankruptcy were the same—thereby gaining <i r
Congress j insdiction over insolvencies, under the
pretext ot the bankrupt power, secondly, to establish
the unlimited power ot Congress over the whole
question, subject only to It cal uniformity, ana by
virtue ot that unlimited power, a right to discharge
the e'ebt wnhout the (onsent ol the creditors Mr.
B followed ihe arguments of the fiiend-. of me
tul1 n the civil la , tte Scottish law, aid tie
English law, and showed that insolvency and
bankruptcy were everywhere distinct, ih't,
under oar system, insolvencies belonged t) t e
States, and bankiupti.es to the & neral C v-
emnenl, tilt one uwhTgtd the person on *ur

a bankrupt system rn c?riSi, except our ac ot 1841,
which ui d-rtook to di«eiaige the debt wiihout the
ctiisertcf the cre'itois. He denied the validity
of "uch discnsr r-s, and said that, if he were a
judge, he woulu pay no more attention to them
that ¡o a chip'er from Gu'hver'a Travels He re-
viewed ihe doetiine ol the cestio lonorwi, and
showed that it was nothing hut our insolvent l?w,
