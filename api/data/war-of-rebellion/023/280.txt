I have been looking for. Send it, with Thirty-first Indiana and Twenty-third Kentucky, to join its brigade with General Nelson. You will remain in command at Murfreesborough for the present and Hazen's brigade will remain there until further orders. Do not leave the roads to Nashville unguarded.

MURFREESBOROUGH, August 7, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

Second Kentucky is guarding bridges between here and La Vergne in detachments; I found it so posted and have not disturbed it. It will not be prudent to remove it till another is supplied. The two regiments I am sending General Nelson to-night he directs shall march by Liberty. This direction given on supposition that Hazen's whole brigade would go. Do not apprehend danger yet. Cannot tell much about enemy's force at Sparta.

General McCOOK, Battle Creek:

When did they move? Did they march or go by rail and how far have they got? Did they follow the river or turn off toward Knoxville? Have you been able to form any idea of their strength?
