I send the following, just received:

7.45 A. M.

General WARREN:

We are at the cross-roads, just beyond the church. The enemy have a line of infantry stretching in a circle around the Poplar Grove Church as a center, radius three-quarters of a mile. We are forming line of battle immediately around the church. The cavalry is skirmishing heavily north and west from the cross-roads; the infantry skirmishers are now being deployed for their assistance. The western road, out which the cavalry was to go, is also guarded by the rebel infantry, and it therefore seems doubtful at present whether the cavalry can go out that road. Major Falls has gone two miles down the Vaughan road, driving a small cavalry force before him. We have found out nothing more so far. Mrs. Smith, near the church, knows nothing. The road was barricaded for a few hundred yards, obstructing our march very much.

Major and Aide-de-Camp.

Major-General.
