manding Wise's brigade, recommends that our batteries across the Appomattox be directed to fire upon the enemy when they make such demonstrations.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Ransom's brigade, killed, 1; wounded, 6. Gracie's brigade, wounded, 1.

Respectfully, &amp;c.

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,Petersburg, Va., October 1, 1864

COLONEL: The enemy fired a volley upon Wise's and Ransom's fronts about 5.30 o'clock last evening. This drew a fire from our line, and was kept up by both parties for about fifteen minutes. No great injury was sustained by either party. It appears from the statement of deserters that the enemy's infantry line in my front is very weak. It appears that the usual picket-line is kept up, and the regiments from which they are taken are lying behind the rear lines of their fortifications in ravines or under the hills. Deserters also report that the larger portion of the Yankee army is believed to have crossed the James, and that the main part of the force on this side of the James have been moved to our right. It would thus appear that the two wings of the Yankee army are connected by a thin line behind fortifications, and if our forces could be concentrated on one wing, while the other was simply held in check the Yankee army might be disabled for further operations this campaign, and might perhaps be entirely driven back toward the Potomac. It is proper to state that although the artillery fire in my front seems to be diminished, there are still a good many guns on the enemy's line.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Gracie's brigade, wounded, 1. Elliott's brigade, killed, 2; wounded, 3. Ransom's brigade, wounded, 3.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

The following casualties are respectfully submitted: Gracie's brigade, wounded, 1; Ransom's brigade, killed, 1.
