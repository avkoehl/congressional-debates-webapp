Captain A. E. DANA,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division:

One of the regiment I sent out to the Opequon this morning has just returned. I gave the commanding officer orders to strike the Opequon at the railroad and destroy all the mills between that point and Smithfield. He has just reported, and says he found it impossible to destroy any mills on the Opequon, because of the heavy force of the enemy on the opposite bank.

Very respectfully, &c.,

Captain A. E. DANA,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Division:

The officers commanding the two regiments report that the enemy have pickets all along the opposite bank of Opequon and at one point near Jackson's Mill, between Jordan Springs and the Berryville pike. The enemy's pickets were on this side, but were afterward driven back. The heaviest force of the enemy was met near the point where the railroad crosses the Opequon, and at which point there is a mill on the opposite bank. The officers of both regiments agree in estimating the force upon the opposite bank at this point as superior in numbers to their own. This force of the bank of the enemy was not fully developed until after my men had engaged them for some time. At Jackson's Mill the enemy also displayed a considerable force. It was mostly cavalry, although some portion was on foot, and it is not known whether it was cavalry dismounted or infantry. The enemy have barricades of rails and rifle-pits thrown up at different points along the opposite bank of the Opequon.

Very respectfully, &c.,

G. A. CUSTER,

Brigadier-General.
