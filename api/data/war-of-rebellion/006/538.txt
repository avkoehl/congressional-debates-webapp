CONFEDERATE STATES STEAMER LOUISIANA, April 22, 1862.

SIR: In obedience to your order we have held a survey upon the steamer Belle Algerine and the tug Mosher. The latter has, we think, loosened the after-bearing of her shaft. This we can, I think, obviate in a few hours. The Belle Algerine leaks badly in the bows, from two holes knocked in her, the captain reports, while working at the raft and also while landing guns at Fort Saint Philip. This we can also remedy, and are now doing so. I trust by to-night both vessels will be service-able.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. B. HUGER,

Commanding the McRae.

SAMUEL BROCK,

Senior Engineer McRae.

GENERAL: Above you will see the report on the vessels reported to you as unfit for service. I send it for your information.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. K. MITCHELL,

Commanding C. S. Naval Forces.

Brigadier General JOHNSON K. DUNCAN,

Commanding Coast Defenses.
