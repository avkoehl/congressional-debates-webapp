the whole -progress of the measure; and now that it
had beea «omp.eted, he claimed that ihe gentlemen
on the other side should act in the same good faith
as he had done.                                           *
Mr "WOODBURY said he rose, not to answer
now any argument oifered by the Sena or from
Rhode ][¡>Und, so far as he had dealt m any of that
article, but to set him right en two or thiee mat-
ters of fact pergonal to himself, (Mr W ) On the
question of the home valuation, the report rcftrre 1
to was made last February, and ihe Senate uruld
see by it, .now in h s hand, that ms'ead of being
confined, Jo the foreign value, as the member from
Rhode Island had asserted, it proposed two modes
of ascertaining the home valuation One was to
considerall .he appraisers near, and aojust the ad-
dition to be made from lime to time on various
articles,, and another was, arter careful inquiry, to
fix a rate per cent to be added for the home valu-
ation
Thus much for that complaint The report was
satisfactory at the time, and, as aopears on its fsce,
had been prepared by the Comptroller, who hsd
acted as Control «loner of the Customs since 1792,
and the incumbent was so capable an officer last
February, that the present Administration had re-
tained him m office.
The next charge wa that, in an exhmt of lbs
receipts from costoms m 1837, they are si\t<d to
be eleven millions and a fraction, while ¡ateiy,m a
schedule from the Regist r, they arpear to have
been mineen millions and a iraotita. Now let
me inform that gentleman both of ihe e -tateta nts
came from the R-g sur. H  keep tbe bo< ks on
this subject, and not ihe Secretary He furnishes
the data; and if any real mista«e has occurred, it
is presumed to h we or gma ed ^ith h,m Tne in-
cumbent at both peri ds is also another effier le
lamed by the present ádmimsírati n.
Bat it is p'obable, that thcr^ is no n 3 ak v. hat

in such years as 1835 ¿>\ 1 1836? D d any h-nao
rabie Senator present e'ima'e the íectipis beta's
hand, then, any higher than he (Mr. W.) iu"1 Did
any one, beforehand, expect an income from
lands in those two years equal to all ihe receipts of
the previous forty years?
It is very easy, after an event occurs, to find
mos' proph t'c sages even m Senates, and to be
very wise as to the causes and prospects of it; bat
show me the man wbo, in 1834 or 1835, antici
pated all which occurred then, and in 1836 and
1837, as to receipts?
The estimates as to lands are alwavs uncertain
beyond Ihote from duties, and thatis one argument
just us"d by the Senator himself for giving them
away Yet even in duties, and while the credit
was, long, and grea'er certainty attainable as to
receipts on bonds chiefly falling due in tte next
year.theeotima'es made by some of my predecessors
differed much more from what happened as to duties
than my own.
Mr. McLane, an ab'e officer, miscalculated over
«even millions m one vear, and Mr Dallas, equal-
ly able, over sixteen millions. A committee of the
Hoiise of Representatives as long ago as 1822,
found the* estimates so uncertain in their nature as
to receipts, that they injiituttd a special inquiry,
and it appeirs that they differed from the actual
results, in some cases, quite seventy three per cent
Here is the report itself.
Bat as another evidence how much more nncer-
tain ate tne lin^s, the party to which the Senator
is attached, evt-n n 1817, insis ed ihat ano her sur-
plus oí ten, fi'iten, or twenty milito is wa  to be
deuved from them in that >ear, and added ano her
di «tribu ion clause for it to the fortification bill
How did their estimates agr e with the facts' Why,
sir, it 'urn d oat as he (Mr W ) then insisted, that
not a dollar o surplus accrued
Doi« it no v become that party, or a member of
it, who, not an hour "go, deliberately proposed to
giveaway ¿J tne luneta because their revenue is so
fluctuating, to mnnt me with not guessing any
nearer thai they e!iJ, under such unprecedented
uuctuaiions?
Let the country decide; and let us examine the
g ea' -nd momentous qjestijn of retrenchment—

dtr pe^otal, «elf h, or party influence^—-but
on facts, argu, en's, sounj pohticat principles,
ard satesmatilke feeling0. This would jet be

Nor c t 1 he (Mr W) be eve, howev-r lis
