General COX, Decatur:

I was coming up to see you to-day, but I have a bad cold and don't feel like visiting. I have sent General Garrard down the river. Keep your cavalry well on the alert on your left flank in observation. I don't hear of any enemy in that direction, but still 'tis well to be watchful.

A statement made by Private Ashbury C. Dale, Company D, Second and Sixth Regiments Missouri Volunteer Infantry, Cockrell's brigade of French's DIVISION, Stewart's corps:

States that he left the rebel army at Palmetto Station, on the Atlanta and WEST Point Railroad, about an hour after sunrise yesterday morning, and arrived at our picket-line near sundown last night. Says he was told that the left of Stewart's corps rests on the Chattahoochee River, and known of his own knowledge that all of the other corps are on the WEST of the railroad. General Lee's corps is on the right of General Stewart, and General Hardee is on the right of General Lee, and extends some distance east of the WEST Point and Atlanta Railroad. All the army have a line of works in their front and appear to be making a permanent camp there; and says that there is a good deal of dissatisfaction in the army caused by General Hood being in command. The line crosses the WEST Point railroad one mile and a half this side of Palmetto Station. He says that the army was transferred to the WEST Point road in order to be more conveniently supplied and to control the road and the country where most of their supplies come from. He knows of no talk among the men about all an expedition upon our rear. He says that he wants to go to work for the United States Government, or be sent to his home, Cape Girardeau, Mo.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

FRANK C. GILLETTE,

Major and Provost-Marshal, Fifteenth Army Corps.
