you by daylight. Keep me advised to the last mounted of appearance, as I hardly think Hood will cross the Oostenaula to this side to attack Rome.

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Cartersville, October 10, 1864.

General CORSE,Rome:

I have just heard from General Garrard. He will start from Stilesborough at once, and you may look for him at Rome early to- morrow on the south of the Etowah. He has three brigades.

General CORSE,

Rome:

Forrest has been driven out of Tennessee by way of Florence. Hood will hear of this and will not venture to attack you or to push up toward La Fayette. Still, be all ready, and I will hurry up my men as fast as they can march.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

ROME, October 10, 1864 - 2. 30 p. m.

General SHERMAN:

I cannot driven Hood's movements yet. The most extravagant reports reach me hourly of the forces, advancing in three columns on this place, and my patrols, of course, strike nothing but cavalry. If possible, send me infantry by cars, when it becomes necessary. A combined attack from the Etowah or Oostenaula will drive me from the peninsula and move [sic] the position of both streams and my pontoon bridges. The Oostenaula cannot be forded between here and Resaca. I will advise you further.

J. M. CORSE,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Cartersville, October 10, 1864.

General CORSE,Rome:

If you have a brigade across the Oostenaula destroy it. Keep the one to the south, for I have ordered General Garrard to approach in that direction. Cars are not to be had. We will advanced direct from Kingston. The attack cannot be made to-day, and by to-morrow I will be near with a large force which Hood will not wait for.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
