• I yield the remaining portion of my time to
the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Lamison.]
- - Mr. LAMISON addressed the House in
remarks which will be found in the Appendix.
• Mr. TOWNSEND, of Pennsylvania. Mr.
©hairman, having had an opportunity at an
earlv period of this session to speak somewhat
at length on the subject of the tariff, I do not
propose to enter into its details now. In what
I shall say I do not intend at all to speak of
pig iron, and I have no doubt my free-trade
friends, and my revenue reform-friend from
Illinois [Mr. Bukchakd] who sits behind me,
will think a tariff speech by a Peunsylvauian
without "pig iron" in it would be very much
like Shakspeare's play of Hamlet with the
part of Hamlet omitted.
I propose to occupy the attention of the com-
mittee for a short time with a branch of the sub-
ject which I have not heard mentioned here-
tofore in the discussions which have taken
place, and that is as to the effect of a tariff on
resumption ofspecie payments. We have been
suffering for the last ten years under an irre-
deemable paper currency. That currency has
varied in its value from thirty-five cents on the
dollar, as it was in July 1864, to eighty-nine
per cent., at which figuie it is now, or ninety
and one fourth cents, at which it stood a little
while ago. It has been subject to great and
violent fluctuations. This has had a bad effect
upon the business of the country. It has ren-
dered contracts between man and man so un-
certain that a man making a contract any day
that was to be consummated at some future time
would be unable to anticipate whether he
would gain or lose by the transaction. It has
been the bane of business. It has been oper-
ating prejudicially upon operations of all kinds
and m all transactions. There has been no
man so high in pecuniary circumstances and no
man so low but what has been more or less
affected by these fluctuations in the value of
the currency.
Let us look for a moment at the condition
of the currency at the time at which specie
payments were suspended and as it stands
now. In 1862, when the banks suspended
specie payments, their immediate liabilities
in circulation, deposits, and what was due to
banks, amounted to $541,000,000. Theirimme-
diately available assets at that time amounted
to $221,000,000, making the whole immediate
liabilities in excess of immediate assets some-
thing like three hundred and twenty million
dollars. We had also at that time in the
country $300,000,000 in specie, ofwhich about
one hundred millions were then in the banks.
The whole amount then of excess of liabilities
being only $320,000,000, was, as respects the
business transactions of the nation, easily
managed. There was no trouble or difficulty
in the every-day operations of commerce, man-
ufactures, or agriculture, however extended,
and when a man made a bargain that was to
be consummated at some future time, he had
a very fair prospect of knowing what he had
to pay or to receive. How is it to-day? By
turning to the tables which have been fur-
nished to us by the Treasury Department, we
find that the immediate liabilities of the banks
on the 27th of February last, such as notes out-
standing, deposits and dues to banks, amounted
altogether to $1,096,000,000, to meet which
the immediate assets in the banks were only
$400,000,000, leaving an excess of immediate
liabilities over available assets in the banks of
something like six hundred and ninety-six
million dollars.
To ascertain the actual condition of the
country, we have, besides regarding the con-
dition of the banks, to look at the condition in
which the Government finds itself. By turn-
ing to the reports of the Secretary of the
Treasury we find that at the same time the
whole amount of immediate indebtedness of
the Treasury was $441,000,000, the imme-
diate assets in coin and currency in the Treas-
ury amounted to $124,000,000, so that the im-
mediate currency liabilities of the nation in
excess of its immediate assets amounted to
$317,000,000.
This amount added to the immediate liabil-
ities of the banks made $1,013,000,000 of
immediate liabilities over and above the im-
mediate assets of the banks and of the Gov-
ernment. We had got into afar worse position
than we were in ten years ago. We had in-
creased the excess of immediate liability over
the amount of immediate assets something
like $700,000,000._
In addition to this growing excess of liability
and indebtedness of the country, as shown by
the bank and Treasury statements, when wo
come to look at the condition of the imports
and exports we find that from the time that
specie payments were suspended up to the
present time we have been constantly and rap-
idly increasing our imports over and above our
exports. The whole amount of the imports
of the country from 1864 down to the end of
the last fiscal year have been, inclusive of five
per cent, for undervaluation and smuggling,
$3,403,000,000, while the whole amount of our
exports reduced to specie values, and in-
cluding specie, amounted to something like
$2,987,000,000; making a balance of $416,-
000,000 against us.
To this we may fairly add freight on im-
ports in foreign vessels, say eight per cent, on
sixty-eight per cent, of the imports, and we
have $184,000,000; and the iuterest we have
paid abroad in that time has amounted to at
least $250,000,000. Our bonds were sold at
an average discount of twenty-two per cent.,
or seventy-eight cents on the dollar; so that
our whole indebtedness abroad, at the lowest
figures, cannot be less than $1,000,000,000 to
$1,200,000,000.
Still further, I would state that the debt
of the country abroad in 1863, according to
the authority of ex-Commissioner Wells, was
almost liquidated; it amounted to nothing
practically; but by inquiry at the Treasury
Department, and by consulting the documents
that are issued therefrom, I find that our in-
debtedness to foreigners is about as stated
above. 1 do not fix it at so high a figure as
my friend from New York [Mr. Koberts] did
the other day when he placed it at $2,000,-
000,000.
Now, what are we to do? What do the
free-traders and the revenue reformers, and
the friends of a revenue tariff, desire to do?
Do they desire to increase that debt, or do
they wish to diminish it? Let their proposed
action and its necessary results be the answer.
They demand a lower tariff. They demand
a reduction of duties, the effect of which
would be to make additional imports. We
are importing to-day at the rate of $30,000,000
to $50,000,000 annually is excess of our
exports. We export annually in payment of
merchandise $50,000,0,p0 in golcl, while we
produce annually only $25,000,000 of gold
throughout the whole countrv. In 1866 the
amount of gold on hand was $300,000,000, of
which $100,000,000 was in the banks, and it
has been going out ever siuee until there is
now only about $130,000,000 in the Treasury
and in the banks and in the hands of the
people.
The revenue reformers propose by their
policy to increase our debt abroad. They
desire to make foreign merchandise cheaper,
to bring a large amount of it into the coun-
try, and thus far displace American manufac-
tures. Another effect will be to raise the
price of gold. This will increase, with a low
tariff, to an indefinite extent, because of the
demand for gold to pay for excessive importa-
tions, until the foreign indebtedness against
us will become unable to be borne, and we
become the slaves of foreign capitalists.
Instead, sir, of being on the road to resump-
tion, we are on the road to an everlasting
suspension. We are _ $700,000,000 further
away from the resumption of specie payments
than we were in 1862, or at any time since.
We are widening the difference between our
assets and our foreign indebtedness. We are
making it broader and greater every day.
That debt is rolling up until it will become
mountain high, when it will render impossible
a return to specie payments, and overwhelm
us in a common bankruptcy and ruin.
Now, what is the remedy for the existing
unfortunate condition of things? How are we
to get back to specie payments? I know that
it is said that the way to resumption is to
resume at once. I know that by congressional
action we can command a resumption, but as
it is a financial and commercial question rather
than a legislative one, I feel well assured that
with our heavy debt abroad and a low tariff
increasing imports we could not maintain a
resumption for a month. It would be a finan-
cial impossibility. An attempt at it now would
be to invite our securities from abroad to
obtain their price in gold at a handsome profit
over their cost. It would be to bring back
millions of bonds and to drain from us every
dollar of specie.
It is not to be done by low tariffs and heavy
importations, and not by buying more than we
sell, as we are doing every day, and not by acting
the part of the spendthrift who spends all and
saves nothing. It can only be reached in one
way, and that "is to sell more than we buy; to
export more than we import, and to regulate the
tariff so that the balance of trade shall be in
our favor. We can not do it under a low tariff,
for every low tariff has destroyed manufac-
tures, impoverished labor, and prostrated agri-
culture. By the means indicated, and by that
only, can we return to specie payments, and
bring values to a sound, proper, and suitable
condition for the business of this great nation.
Our country was never so prosperous as when
the tariffs have been high enough to give the
preference of our markets to the American
citizen, and never so dilapidated in its busi-
ness relations as when mere revenue tariffs
gave our markets to the cheap goods of
foreigners.
The bill of the majority makes unwise dis-
criminations. It leaves duties remain on
articles we neither prodifce or manufacture,
and takes them off or reduces them on those
articles our own workmen can supply. This,
in my judgment, reverses 'afll the best princi-
ples of political economy, and should that
policy prevail, another inundation of foreign
fabrics, an increased indebtedness abroad, will
postpone resumption to a^period beyond the
lives of most of those whe.now sit within this
Hall.
Now it has been said by gentlemen on &e
opposite side of the House that the tariff is a
tax on the industry of the people; that it is not
