TERRITORIAL BUSINESS.
The SPEAKER stated that the first busi-
ness in order was the consideration of territorial
business, under the following resolution adopted
by the House on the 12th of May last:
" RaoLved, That one week, beginning with the fourth
Monday in June next, be set apart for the consideration of
territorial business, and from day to day thereafter, until
the same is disposed of, provided that not more than one
week shall be thus set apart."
COMPENSATION TO CLERK TO COMMITTEE.
Mr. CAMPBELL, of Ohio. I rise to offer a
resolution in the nature of a privileged question.
The special committee appointed to investigate
the matter of an assault upon a Senator, under
the authority given to it by the House, employed
a clerk to facilitate the investigation. They em-
ployed a clerk to report the proceedings in short-
hand, and it is necessary that he should be paid.
The committee are unanimously of opinion, I
believe, that the resolution which I offer should
be passed.
The resolution was read, as follows:
Resolved, That the Clerk bo directed to pay out of the
contingent fund of the House to Francis II. Smith, $300 for
Ins services as cterk of the committee of investigation, ap-
pointed under the resolution of the Hou e dated May 2.i,
1856, and lor ropoiling the testimony taken before said
committee.
Mr. COBB, of Georgia. I will simply state, as
a member of that committee, that the resolution
did meet the unanimous approval of the commit-
tee, and I trust no objection will be made to it.
I will state, for the satisfaction of the House, that
the cleric to the committcc was a stenographer;
and that the work performed by liim, accoiding
to the regular price of that class of work, would
amount to more than is allowed by the resolution.
The resolution was agreed to.
Mr. KELSEY. I rise to a privileged question.
The Committee oil Engraving have' directed me
to submit the following resolution:
Resolved, That the Committee on Engravim? he, and
Uley are hereby, authorized to cause to be liihogiaphocl and
printed the map. accompanying the lettci of the Sccictaiy
of War, transmittal!! a copyot Major Laidley's lepnrt nn
the limber and mineral resources of the Deep River coun-
try, m Nouh Ouioima,
The SPEAKER. The House is now acting
under a suspension of the rules; and the report
is consequently not in order.
Mr. GROW. Tins being the week set apart
for the consideration of territorial business, and
as wo have a number of bills of ordinary legisla-
tion for Territories, and as Wednesday next is
set aside for the consideration of a bill for the
admission of Kansas into the Union, I propose
now to make a report from the Committee on
Territories.
REPORTS OF TERRITORIAL BUSINESS.
_ Mr. GROW, from the Committee on Territo-
ries, then reported a bill to make appropriations
for the construction of a penitentiary 111 the Ter-
ritory of Nebraska; which was read a first and
second time.
Mr. GROW. I ask that the bill may now be
put upon its passage.
The bill, which was read in e.rte7isoy appropri-
ates ยง30,000, to be expended under the direction
of the Secretary of the Treasury, for the erection
of a penitentiary in the Territory of Nebraska,
provided it be built and completed, including the
cost of site, for the sum thus appropriated. i
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. That bill makes !
fVj ftPProPriation, and the rules provide that such '
hills shall be sent to the Committee of the Whole -
011 the state of the Union. !
Mr. GROW. I move a suspension of the rule i
which requires the bill to be referred to the Com- !
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union. i
The SPEAKER. The House is aheady acting '
under a suspension of the rules, and therefore the I
motion is not in order. j
Mr. GROW. I then appeal to the gentleman j
from Tennessee to let this bill be put upon its j
passage. |
Mr. JONES. I cannot consent to it, because j
I am opposed to the bill any way. i
Mr. GROW. Then I move to refer the bill to
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. COMINS. I ask the unanimous consent
of the House to present a resolution, that it may
be referred to the Committee on Printing under
the rules.
Mr. GROW. I must insist that the time set
apart for the consideration of territorial business
snail be devoted exclusively to that purpose. If
I give way for one thing 1 must for another.
Mr. COMINS. Then I move to suspend the
rules.
The SPEAKER. The House is already acting
under a suspension of the rules.
Mr. PURVIANCE, from the Committee on
Territories, reported the following bills; which
were severally read a first and second time, and
referred to the Committee of the W hole on the
state of the Union:
A bill making an appropriation for the erection
of public buildings in Washington Territory;
A bill for the construction of a road from Fort
Ridgley, in the Territory of Minnesota, to the
South Pass of the Rocky Mountains, in the Ter-
ritory of Nebraska; and
A bill making an appropriation of $5,000 for
the construction of an embankment in Minnesota
Territory.
Mr. MORRILL, from the same committee, re-
ported back House bill (No. 197) with an amend-
ment in the nature of a substitute, authorizing
and directing the President of the United States
to cause the southern boundary line of the Terri-
tory of Kansas, from the western boundaiy of the
State of Mnssouii to the eastern boundary of the
Territory of New Mexico, to be surveyed and
distinctly marked, and directing him to cause a
plot of such survey to be deposited m the office
of the Secretary of the Interior, and another plot
thereof m the office of the Secretary of the Terri-
tory of Kansas.
Mr. MORRILL. I propose, Mr. Speaker, if
there be no objection, to have this bill immedi-
ately put upon its passage. The President in his
annual message to Congress recommends a mea-
sure of this kind. The southern boundary line
of Kansas Territory has never been surveyed or
established; and the rapidly extending settle-
ments in that region, and the fact, that the main
route between Independence, in the State of Mis-
souri, and the Territory of New Mexico, runs
through it, renders it absolutely necessary that
the line should be established. I therefore ask
that the bill be put immediately upon its pas-
sage .
Mr. PHELPS. I would merely remark to the
House, that early m the session I introduced the
bill which is now reported by the Committee on
Teintories. I approve of the substitute which
the committee recommend. It is a mere change
of phraseology. There is a pressing necessity
for this boundary line being established. The
bill does not propose any appropriation at this
time; therefore no objection exists to its consid-
eration now. I hope that the amendment recom-
mended by the committee will be adopted.
The question was put, and the amendment was
adopted.
The bill, as amended, was ordered to be en-
grossed and read a third time; and being engross-
ed, it was accordingly read the third "time, and
passed.
Mr. MORRILL, from the same committee,
reported a bill for the increase of the territorial
libraries of Minnesota, New Mexico, Oregon,
Utah, Washington, Kansas,and Nebraska; which
was read a first and second time, referred to the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
and ordered to be printed.
ENROLLED BILLS.
Mr. PIKE, from the Committee on Enrolled
Bills, reported as truly enrolled the following
bills; when the Speaker signed the same:
An act (H. It. No. 311) to revive and continue
in force the provisions of the act of 3853, in rela-
tion to suspended entries of public lands, and the
act of 1846, in relation to suspended preemption
land claims; and
An act (H. R. No. 207) for the relief of the
heirs of Colonel Charles Simms, late collector of
the port of Alexandria.
ADDITIONAL MESSENGER FOR THE HOUSE.
Mr. BALL. I ask the unanimous consent of
the House to introduce a resolution, which I hold
in my hand, and of which I will explain the
necessity.
There are five rooms in the southern wing of
the Capitol, which have been finished and turned
over to the use of the committees of this House.
There is no messenger that can be spared to take
charge of these rooms; and, in consequence, some
of the furniture has already been broken and
injured for want of some person to take care of
it. I now wish to introduce a resolution for the
purpose of authorizing the Doorkeeper to appoint
an additional messenger.
Mr. COBB, of Alabama. I shall object to that.
If you ask to authorize the Commissioner of
Public Buildings to appoint a person for that pur-
pose, I will have no objection.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I think that a
messenger can be spared from about the House
to take charge of those rooms. It is not neces-
sary to have two or three messengers at each of
these doors.
Mr. BALL. Is it not in order to move to sus-
pend the rules ?
The SPEAKER. It is not in order, inasmuch
as the House is acting under a motion to suspend
the rules.
MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE.
A message was received from the Senate, by
Asbury Dickins, their Secretary, notifying the
House that that body had agreed to the amend-
ment of the House to a bill entitled " An act to
change the time of holding the district couit of
the United States at Wytheville, in the western
district of Virginia.
And also, that that body had passed a joint res-
olution, and bills of the following titles; in which
they ask the concurrence of the House:
An act to incorporate the Apothecaries' Asso-
ciation of the District of Columbia;
An act to relieve the corporation of George-
town from the payment of bills for making roads
west of Rock creek;
An act to authorize the investigation and de-
termination of asserted titles to the Hot springs
of Ouachita, in the State of Arkansas;
An act to provide for the public instruction of
youth in primary schools throughout the county
of Washington, m the Dictrict of Columbia, with-
out the limits of the cities of Washington and
Georgetown; and
Joint resolution for supplying new members of
the Senate and House of Representatives with
such books of a public character as have been
heretofore supplied.
UNITED STATES COURTS IN TENNESSEE-
CHANGE OF TIME.
Mr. ZOLLICOFFER. I hold in my hand a
bill for changing the time of holding the United
States courts in the State of Tennessee. There
is a necessity for its passage at an early day, and
I presume there will be no objection to it. I ask
the consent of the House to introduce the bill,
and to have it put on its passage.
Mr. GRO W. The time set apart for territo-
rial business is so short that I must object to
everything not having reference to such business.
Mr. ZOLLICOFFER. I hope the gentleman
will not object. It will not occupy more than a
minute or two. The bill ought to be passed at
once.
Mr. GROW. Very well, if there is no objec-
tion to the bill, and to be no discussion on it, I
will withdraw my objection.
The bill was then introduced, and read a first
and second time.
It was then read through. It provides that the
United States circuit and district sourts of the
several districts in the State of Tennessee shall be
held at the following times and places, to wit: At
Jackson, on the first Mondays of April and Oc-
tober; at Nashville on the third Mondays of April
and Octobcr;and atKnoxville on the third Mon-
days of May and tl^e fourth Mondays of Novem-
ber. The hill also makes the necessary provisions
for accommodating the business of said courts
to the changes of time.
The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read
a third time; and being engrossed, was accord-
ingly read the third time, and passed.
