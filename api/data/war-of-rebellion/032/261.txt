the two howitzers near the Perryville road. When the enemy withdrew their cannon from the Jackson road, I hear them fire from the southwest on Lieutenant-Colonel Baumer's position. I anticipated an attack on the Bloomfield road; then I went to Fort C, to be ready for them there; but they were held in check by Lieutenant-Colonel Baumer and the two howitzers, under Lieutenant Jacoby. At 2. 30 p. m. the firing ceased, the enemy withdrawing. No loss to report. Beg leave to mention Sergt. George Voelker and Corporal Gier, Company D, Second Missouri Artillery, for firing their pieces with excellent precision.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GENERAL: I have the honor to lay before you also the actions of the artillery in the pursuit of the enemy from Bloomfield to Chalk Bluff.

Left Bloomfield at 12 m. on the night of the 30th of April. About 5 a. m. May 1, our advance drove in the enemy's pickets. At 5. 30 the enemy had taken position, with two 6-pounders and two 3-inch rifled Parrott guns, on the first range of hills, called Crowley's Ridge. Lieutenant [Lawrence] Jacoby soon drove them, with shells, from their position. About 2 miles farther the enemy tried to make a stand, but Lieutenant Jacoby and Lieutenant [Joseph B.] Atwater, of Cole's battery, drove them off which a few shots. Then I ordered the two mountain howitzers, under Captain [Perry D.] McClanahan, to follow up with the advance. They fired several times on the enemy, when they broke and ran. About noon there was a charge made by Colonel [John M.] Glover, sustained by the two mountain howitzers. Then a charge of the brigade was made. At 4.30 p. m. the enemy made a stand again, about 1\2 miles beyond Four Mile, and opened a heavy with four pieces of artillery and infantry. Captain [George] Hauck's battery took position. I was wounded in the foot by a grape-shot, and was obliged to fall to the rear.

No loss in the artillery by the enemy's fire. Private Preuzner, Company K, Second Missouri Artillery, Hauck's battery, fell, with his horse, and had a leg bruised.

I have the honor to be, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
