CORINTH, November 25, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT,

Memphis:

A resident spy of General Dodge's, near Okolona, has just sent me a messenger; arrived this evening, giving me information confirming the fact that General Forrest has a force of cavalry and artillery under Lee, Ferguson, Richardson, Inge, and Gholson; that they are about moving on this place, and that Roddey's command is to co-operate. That demonstration is to be made on the road west of this to draw off cavalry and weaken us as much as possible.

He states the forces at 12,000, and reports a portion of the force infantry. Says there are 5 generals there, but messenger-a woman whose name was given to me in a written memorandum by General Dodge as the medium of communication-does not recollect.

Infantry should be sent here at once by railroad, and whether he moves or not I again urge additional infantry be sent here.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Colonel Rowett, with Seventh Illinois, has just arrived from General Dodge. He has his headquarters at Pulaski; is repairing railroad from Columbia to Decatur. He sends me word that General Lee left Courtland, Ala., with his command for Okolona on the 13th, Roddey remaining in Tuscumbia Valley. Colonel Rowett brings news of Newsom's command returning to Jackson from Tuscumbia on Sunday night. I learned the same fact from country rumors.

General Dodge has sent here for his regimental stores left here. The New York brigade, at Eastport, is embarking on transports to-day, destination Burnside. Report at Eastport that Faulkner is moving on Paducah. This does not correspond with my information.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Corinth, Miss.:

Notify Colonel Mizner of your information and let him move to find the enemy, but with care. A demonstration by us will check their movement. As soon as they develop their line of attack, Tuttle's force will move up and I will throw the cavalry round from Somerville. Keep Tuttle advised.
