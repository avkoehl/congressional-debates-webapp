LEXINGTON, April 28, 1865.

Major-General PALMER,

Headquarters, Louisville, Ky.:

The flag-of-truce party left Mount Sterling this morning. They accept our terms, with the exception of surrender of officers' horses. They have copy of terms and will submit them to Colonel Giltner, commanding, who is supposed to be beyond Mount Sterling. Scouts report no rebels within nine miles of the place. Am endeavoring to get mounted force to that point.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MOUNT STERLING, April 28, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Scouts report no enemy within nine miles. The flag of truce started this morning.

Assistant Adjutant-General.

MOUNT STERLING, KY., April 28, 1865.

Captain J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I learn by courier from flag of truce that the citizens report that some 300 of Giltner's forces were within eighteen miles of this place and have fallen back, and that it was reported there that Giltner, with his command, was falling back to Salyersville, to disband to try and save their horses.

H. N. BENJAMIN,

Commanding.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DEPARTMENT OF KENTUCKY,Lexington, Ky., April 28, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN G. ROGERS,

Lebanon, Ky.:

Captain Crupper must take care of Green, Hart, and upper end of Barren Counties. It would be well for him to divide his men into squads and hunt down the guerrilla Goulder. Tom Palmer, the general's old scout, will meet Captain Crupper at Greensborough on Saturday or Sunday for duty. Let them establish a depot for rations at Greensburg or some central point.

By order of Brigadier General E. H. Hobson:

J. S. BUTLER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
