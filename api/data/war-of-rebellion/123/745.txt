been strongly urged by General McClellan. The order was made expressly to meet what were supposed to be his wishes.

I understood from General Halleck that General Porter has been appointed provost-marshal, but that he does not sanction the change of the present military departments by creating a new command in Pennsylvania. Every effort on my part will be made to conform to your views and remove any obstacle or afford any facility for the organization of the troops.

HARRISBURG, PA., November 8, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Mr. Meredith read me your dispatch stating that the drafted men would be organized into companies and regiments. The one to me states companies only. The regimental organizations to be made at Washington. In consultation with the Governor and Mr. Meredith they expressed decidedly the opinion that regimental organization was necessary to calm the men, now greatly excited, and to satisfy them that their companies will not be broken up and the men assigned to old regiments. My own opinion is that this should be accorded. If it is, we shall get the entire draft; but if not, we will have difficulty in collecting the men. I have authorized the regimental organizations of volunteers in lieu of drafted men, which had previously been sanctioned. One regiment here, and perhaps another at Philadelphia.

L. THOMAS,

Adjutant-General.
