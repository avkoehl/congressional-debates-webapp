Governor JOHN A. ANDREW,

I am authorized by the President to say, in reply to your telegram, the order for the militia and three-months" men was made by the President himself upon deliberate consultation with the Secretary of War and other members of his Cabinet and his military advisers. You are requested not to make any public use of this.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Your dispatch dated 27th was received this morning. Fifteen militia regiments had been accepted for three-months" service, mostly in New York and Brooklyn. It is supposed they will average nearly 800 each. Part have left; remainder will move as fast as transportation can be provided. Your request to discontinue acceptances of three-months" regiments is noticed and will be strictly observed.
