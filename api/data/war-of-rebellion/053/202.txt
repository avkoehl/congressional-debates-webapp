Colonel EDWARD HATCH,

Commanding Cavalry Division, In the Field:

Our cavalry, McCrillis, Hurst, and Phillips, have returned via Saulsbury. McCrillis is here. You had better fall back on the Holly Springs road within supporting distance of Colonel Rice, who is at Davis' Mills, and keep open communication with him, watching all approaches to this place from that direction. Inform me of all important movements of the enemy, or information thereof. Our cavalry were forced to fall back from Salem with quite a number killed and wounded.

By order of T. W. Sweeny, brigadier-general commanding:

L. H. EVERTS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,La Grange, Tenn., October 9, 1863.

Communicate with Colonel Hatch. He must fall back on the Holly Springs road, as the enemy is in strong force at Salem, having driven our forces out of that place last night. Colonels Hurst, McCrillis, and a part of the Ninth Illinois Infantry (mounted) having returned by way of Saulsbury, you will hold your position until further orders. Send the inclosed dispatch to Colonel Hatch.
