Major-General BUTTERFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

The train is here with the two batteries of my division. It has been detained by getting off track. Shall these batteries be taken up to Cowan and Eleventh Corps battery brought back on return, or shall my two batteries go on to Stevenson? I ordered my battery horses back, but messenger has not returned. They may be in Bridgeport.

(Received 11.45 a. m., 26th.)

General ALPHEUS S. WILLIAMS:

No batteries of yours have been ordered to Bridgeport; it was the batteries of General Geary's division and General Howard's corps, that you were relieving, that were ordered forward. If you have started horses from your batteries you had better send and have them return at once. If you have not relieved Howard's and Geary's troops, do so at once, and send them to Bridgeport, short route.

General Slocum will give all orders for your division.

Major-General.
