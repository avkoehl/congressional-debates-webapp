The revenues, then, have been economically
assessed and collected. This system of raising
revenues is the best that could be devised. It is
raised from vices, luxuries, or the great wealth
of'the country. The internal revenue for the
fiscalyear ending June 30, 1809, was as follows:

No tax is levied upon lands or houses, or
horses or cattle, for the national Government.
The industry of the countiy pays almost none,
and soon it, will be entirely relieved. Ohio, at
least, has no right to complain of the internal
revenue laws.^ In wealth and population Ohio
is one tenth of the Union. Her share of inter-
nal revenue taxation would then be $10,000,000
annually.
Now, let us see how much Ohio pays, as com-
paredwith New \ ork ami Massachusetts; and
a similar comparison might be made between
other western and eastern States. The total
amount collected in the fiscal year ending .lime
30, 1870, was as follows:

The revenue ill Ohio is nearly all from whisky
find tobacco. I heso articles ju*o exported to
other States, especially to the South, The tax
is thus refunded, while the real tax paid by the
people, of Ohio is less probably than $-1,000,000,
or only one fourth of what it, would be if levied
according to wealth or population.
Tho tax paid by Massachusetts, after deduct-
ing whisky exported, exceeds $0,000,000, or
hlt,y per cent, more than Ohio, while Ohio lias
double her wealth and more than double her
population.
Newlork pays live limes as niueh as Ohio,
though her population is not, double that of
Ohio.
And so it has boon with the income (ax, 1

So much for internal revenue taxes,
do not oppress the people. The taxes which
do oppress are the State, conntv, ciiv, and
local taxes, levied under State authoniv, as
every citizen knows.
But even this system of internal levenue has
been vastly improved and ii:1 burdens reduced
by tho recent action of Oongrv^.

'Ihe total annual reductions-are about fifty
million dollars. With this reduction of tax-
ation the law authorizes a large reduction in
the revenue oflioers. And soon Congress will
be able to dispense with all internal revenue
taxes except those on spirits, liquors, and
tobacco.
The revenue from imports in the fiscal year
18C0 was $176,557,583.
_A large part of this was derived from brandy,
wine,_ ale, tobacco, embroideries, silks, and
luxuries; and Congress, by the new law on the
subject,'hasgreatly reduced the duties on such
articles as cuter into general use anions the
people. '
The total annual reduction in this form of
taxation will be over twenty-seven million
dollars.
_ What system of taxation is proposed in oppo-
sition to this?
The Democratic national convention of 1SG3
resolved in favor of ''equal taxation of every
spcciea of properly." This means direct taxes
on all propeiiy for the support of the national
Government, and this would impose a burden
on lands and goods which could not be endured.
Die administration of President Grant, then,
has been eminently successful and economical
in the modeot assessing-and collecting the rev-
enues, and in relieving industry from burdens.
THIS PUBLIC DEBT.
The administration of President Grant has
achieved a success in the management of the
great Democratic national debt which com-
mands tile wonder and admiration of both
heuiispb ero.

Sixteen years, and provision must be made 1'or
tliese
it in some form. Only two modes of disposing
of it exist. It must either be paid, or funded
into new bonds and made payable in the future
What is the position of the Democratic par'y''
Jiastern Democrats insist that it shall be paid
in gold, while western Democrats affirm that it
should be paid in greenbacks, and both insist
that it shall be paid, without any extension of
time, from money collected by taxation from
the people. In other words, they propose
to collect by taxation §150,000,000 a year for
sixteen years lo pay the debt.
Let us see if this is their position.
And first, as to time of payment. The plat-
form of the Democratic national convention of
July 7,186S, laid down as one of its principles:
" Payment of the public debt of the United States
as rapidly as practicable; all money drawn from tho
people by taxation, except so much as is requisite for
the necessities ol the Government,"
being applied to such payment."
Ihe Democratic Ohio State convention of
Januarys, 18G8, by resolution declared that—
time tor pwffi d t0 ^ Pl!m f°r e*^ingthe
Mr. Vallandighain, in a speech made August
27, 3808, at St. Paris, in the district which I
have tho honor to represent, said :
I??11  wl ? tickct votes
thai, the fitbt shall bo paid at tho earliest day prae-
ticahlo: no twenty years, no forty years, but as soon
as wo can we propose to take that up, and tho bond-
holder shallhaveit m the legal currency of tho ecun-
t ry, or notUmo.
During the present session of Congress nearly
every Democrat voted against the "funding
bill, which proposed a mode of extending the
time of payment. The Democrats, then, insist
on paymentwithin the next sixteen years. Bui
where shall Ihe money be obtained to pay?
J hoto n,re but two sources, taxation find an
issue of greenbacks.
Lot no man be deceived by the idea that the
-Democratic party favor an issue of greenback
currency to pay the debt, or any increase of
the paper currency.
The national Democratic convention of 1808
did not so resolve, but did resolve in favor of
payment with—
"Money drawn from tho peoplo by taxation."
Tho Ohio Democratic convention of June
1,1870, made no resolve in favor of an increase
ol currency.
Duiing the war, when it became necessary
to issue greenbacks to pay our soldiers, tho
whole Democratic party opposed the scheme
On the 29th January, 18G2, Mr. Pendleton
said in Congress, in discussing the bill author-
izing an issue of greenbacks :
I doubt whether there is any power in tho Fed-
eral Government to issue these notes. You sond
those notes out into the world stamped with irre-
deeuyibihtv. You put on them the ramlc of Cain •
and, like Cam, they will go forth to bo vagabonds
and iujjitives on the earth."
When the last loan bill was under consider-
ation in Congress, on 128th Februarv, ISCo,
nearly every Democrat in the House voted for
au amendment, to it in these words, before ail
the greenbacks were issued:
"Tha,t no note or obligation hereafter issued under
any act ol Congress shall be a legal fender; anil no
lieaMu-y note hereafter to he issued under any law
Shan 1,0 for a less cmn than ilOU/'-Woic, vol.55, p.
Lhe Democratic party, then, allirm the un-
constitutionality ol greenbacks, and oppose
their issue.
They are opposed to national br.iik currcncy
anu in x>ivor ot abolishing the banks. T1)hy so
resoived in the Ohio convention of June 1,
1870.
_ f hoy are opposed to a paper cuirency arid
in f, vor ot contraction and hard money, which
means ''hard times." When tho ''funding
bill" was under consideration in the House,
at this session of Congress, tho financial leader
of tho Democratic party in tho House. [Mr.
