CARE OF ROAD.

The repairs of the 877 miles of road was continued from last year. The Nashville and Chattanooga line has been made new for its whole length - cross-ties and T-iron substituted for the U- iron and stringers - so that from one of the worst and least available it has become one of the best under my control. Large additions have been made to the yard at Nashville, at Decherd, and Stevenson. Side-tracks to lumber yard, Government saw-mills, &amp;c., have rendered the work of keeping all the different departments of the railroad service in efficient operation much easier. To complete and keep in repair the track upon this long line of road there has been purchased 777,879 cross-ties, 104, 100 feet switch timber, and 38 1/2 sets switch ties, the total cost of which, delivered upon the lines of road where needed, has been $414,727.15. During the year the number of tons of new iron has been 7,833.3. This has been distributed as follows:

CARE OF BRIDGES.

On the Nashville and Decatur Railroad line 8,000 feet of trestle bridges have been constructed during the year. With the exception of the high trestle-work in Nashville, the high waters of 1864 carried out all the bridges once, and many of them twice; while in Hood's movements upon Nashville in December, 1864, they were destroyed by fire the same number of times. In addition to this temporary rebuilding of these bridges with trestle-work, 2,145 feet of bridges upon this line have been permanently built by contractors - Post, Skidmore & Co. and Boomer & Co. - with Howe's truss and McCallum bridges.

NASHVILLE AND CHATTANOOGA.

On the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad line 4,259 feet of bridges have been built in a temporary manner, yet intended to be permanent.
