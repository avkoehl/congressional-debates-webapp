Two lines of his troops have disappeared in the woods on the hills, and all seems going well. Will advise you further as soon as I can get word from Sedgwick.

BUTTERFIELD.

MAY 3, 1863-12.30 p.m.

General HOOKER:

Sedgwick's lines are now seen moving forward admirably and rapidly. With our glasses his troops are just made out. He has suffered but little, as we learn, in carrying the heights. Will keep you fully advised every moment.

BUTTERFIELD.

MAY 3, 1863-12.32 p.m.

General HOOKER:

Signal reports (12 m.) enemy still being driven on Sedgwick's right. To the left and rear of the Howison house the enemy have taken a position on Telegraph road,and are holding our forces in check. They are hotly contesting the ground at this point.

BUTTERFIELD.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION, May 3, 1863-1 p.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel McMAHON,Assistant Adjutant-General, Sixth Corps:

SIR: I have the honor to report that my division has taken five of the enemy's fortified works, one battery, and a large number of prisoners; the exact number I can [cannot] now state; they are still coming in. My loss in officers and men has been considerable.

A. P. HOWE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

MAY 3, 1863-1 p.m.

General HOOKER:

Enemy evacuating rifle-pits on the run, and artillery and infantry are moving at the double-quick to re-enforce the enemy at Chancellorsville; also everything appearing to be clean in our front or south of us. Shall I lay one bridge or two?

H. W. BENHAM.

MAY 3, 1863-1 p.m.

General HOOKER:

Colonel Smith, of General Owen's brigade, in charge of pickets, reports the enemy moving large bodies, with artillery, from Fredericksburg toward our right. I have sent orders to fire on such, if they pass within our range, just to make sure they are not our troops. The pickets of the enemy are reported to be leaving the rifle-pits across the river. General Benham is ready to throw the bridges, but none of our troops have made their appearance from above or below.

HENRY J. HUNT.

(Repeat to General Butterfield.)
