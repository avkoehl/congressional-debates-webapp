After   brief  remit kt>  from Messrs   T All ATERRO  anl
BRIGGS,
Mr REYNOLDS and that th" onernit bill from the
Senate, and his amendment, both being read, it remained
only for him to apply one to the othei, and the committee
would see at once the decision of the Chair ought to be sus
tamed It 19 impossible Mr R observed, tha any substantial
difference could be marked out by any, the most discnmi
natmg gentleman fhe bill to which the amen Iment is offered,
provides for pensions for certain Indian wainors, and the
amendment piovides for pensions for certain wr-He warnois
Who can contend that the amendment is not similar in principle
to theongmal bill"? Bo h the bill and amendment prov de for
pensioning certain wainors, an 1 because one set of wanioft, is
red an line other white i&this in prmcij le, any incongiuityi
Tfee most technical special pleader m a county court, could
not discover any diff rence m the above ca-,es
It seemed to h m, Mr R ca d, that this committee would not
be hsposed to reject this amendment piovidins for white wai
norsand Revolutionary soldiers as he contended they were in
the Revolution, and to buslam the bill piovi hog fbi Indians
Who can compare the services of the Indian warnois to the
noble deeds perfoimed by those brave white men who fought
for this country between 17S3 and 1795? There are no men on
earth whoseservices were move «evere and hazardous than the
above, and at the same time whose servicer wcie nure honora
ble and beneficial to the country, an I who at the &ame time have
been so poorly rewarde ^ for t he same The u i history of the
hardships anJ privations suffered by thos* bme men, and the
perilous enterpriser and noole deed  pei fc-rmee. by them i« not
well known Durirs the abov« peiiod, be \een 1783 and
1795 more mnoa nt blood vs sbhel than in Ü o whol^Revolu
lion besides More lives were lot. n the d strot.s battle of
General St Clair with the T ¡dtars thai tin, Americans lost Ji
any other one battle ever fought on the Amem an continent
If the claims of these patriots are not so ac ed on by
Congress, these men will cease to exist on this earth They
and their troubles will soon rest in peace m the ¡rrave The
soldiers who bore arms m the period between 1783 and 1795
must average 75 years of age or moie Three fourths of the*e
brave men must be dead, so that but a few remain to receive
the bounty of their Government    No one, at this iaie ciay, can
know and appieciate the hardships and sufferings of the peo
pie m the West during this period These worthy men, for
whom I have introduced the amendment to grant them pen
stone, braved every opposition, and retained the country m
defiance of ail savage hostility During the greater part of this
disastrous period, the General Government afforded them no
assistance, but permitted these biave soldiers to work out their
own tempoial salvation, or perish in the attempt
Mr R said he merely mentioned this service and the devo
tionof these men to their country, to prove to the committee
that they have a meritorious claim on the country and shall
the mere cob web rules of this House be interposed to prevent
their claims from coming before Congress1* The rules of this
Iíoüsse were established in such manner that the ordinary pub
lie bu^inesscannot be earned on There are so many artificial
cob webs, and so much technrcal nonsense in these rules, that
the common sense mode of doing business could not be pur
sued
Mr R said that he had had petitions for months m his
diawer without having the power, but barely once or twice dur
mg this whole session of Congiess to present them to the
House All other membeis are'm the tame situation This
calamity wasequaly visited on all, he presumed These rule-
may preventany membei in this Ilou-e for months and pei
hajis for the whole session, from bringing before Congiess ->ub
jects of the greatest importance to their constituent  This
veiy subject may again never see the light of day These ru Its
may be so interposed that it may sleep foiever without bung
bioiightbefore Congress
Tnese rules seemed to him to be of such baneful influence,
that the standing and efficiency of this House to do business
were injuied, and the character of the House itself was by
them let dow° in the estimation of the people He would ap
peal to any gentleman lfsuch rules ought, injusfce tobe^u=>
tamed, to the injury and complete overthrow ol pubic bnsi
ness
But, Mr R observed in the case before the commit ee theie
w-is no necessity of a liberal constiuction to be given to the
rules The most technical ronstiuction could not be given to
overthrow the judgment of the Chair* The cimraon sense of
every individual will at once force him to the conclusion that
theie is no difference in principle between granting a pension
to white or red warriors He hoped the opinion of the Chair
Tftould be sustained, and finally pensions be granted to the offi
cersand soldiers as provided in his amendment              ,
Pending the question on the appeal-
On motion of Mr  BRIGGS, the committee rose, and the
chairman íepotted the action of the committee on the above

Mi WRIGHT from the Committee on Commerce, to which
had been refened the petition of th j ilota of the port of New
Y oik praying the repeal or modification of the law concerning
pilots, passed by Congress m 1637, reported a bill to repeal the
law of the 2d of March, 1337 upon that bubject
Mr W said, as the bill was accomjjanied by no written re-
port, he desired, under the indulgence of the Senate, as it "was
not perhaps strictly m ordei, to make a few remarks The sub
ject was one of deep mteiest, m ceitam localities at least, and
especially at the poit of New Yoik The bifl was reported,
not by the unammousvoice of the committee, but by the con
sent of a bare majonty, and that majority was pledged to no
paiucuUr action or vote upon the bill itself It might not be
considered the best couibe to pass this bill, but his object was
that Senators should examine the question, when he thought all
would agieethatsomethmgshouldbedone
That this examination might be directed to what he believed
t> be the true poirts to be examined for practical action, he
asked le?ve to say that it would btioun 1 that the verv first ^-es
moh of the veiy fist Congiess which was convened under the
Const tution i-^uming authority over the subject, devolved the
whole regulation of the p lotase of the port* of the country
upon therespec ive te a es m which the ports are situate, ('un
til further legislative provision ^hall be made by Congress "
He referred to the act of the 7th August, 1789, "fot the esta
bhshment and support of light-houses, beacons, buoys, and
ptblic piers " The fourth section of that act u> m the follow'
mg worls
"Sec 4 Andbe it fuither pnacted, T atall pilotsm the
bays inlets,n\eis, harbors, and ports oi the United Siates,
sha 1 continue to be regulated m conformity with the existing
laws of the States respectively, wherein such pilots may be, or
wi hsuch laws as the States may respectively, hereafter en
act for the purpose, until further legislative provision shall
be mad? by Congress "
From the passage of that law up to the year 1837, Congress
never attempted to exercise the power ol reguUtng pilotage
at any port m the country, and the subject wa^ made one of
established State legislation In the state ol New Y ork, that
had been emphatically so
A grave quest'on had existed in the minds of some and he
was one among thenumbu, a3 to which of the Governments—
the S ate ot the National—possessed the constitutional right to
exercise this power He inc ined to consider ita branch of the
municipal regulations belonging to the States, like the quar
antme laws port wardens wharfage, and the like and nota le
gulation of commeice, exclusively conferred upon Congiess
Yet he did not deeire to agitate this question upon the present
occasion In reference to this immediate question, it was im
material to him which Government exercised the power, if one
Government exercised it exclusively, so as to make the regula
tions applicable to the same port, equal as to all the pilots of
that port
Such wat, the fact now The aU of Congress of lS37wa=¡ par
tial and who] y defective It could apply to at most, but two
ports m the countrv and it was doubtful whether upon full m
\ estimation it would \ rove to be applicable to more than a sin
ale one—the poit ot Nevv York and as to thit post it makes i o
other regulation than to let in putts from another fctate, without
any ropon ibility or accountability any where, while (he New
Voik pilots are held bound by all the responsibilities, all the
penalties and ill the assessments imposed bv the State law
Ths is ur equal and unju=>f If the State law is to prevail, it
should prevail is to all If the law of Cot grebs be the*avv,it
alone should be enforced Every pilot of the same port no mat
tei from what authority he may derive his license and character
ts a pilot, should enjoy the same privileges, and be subject to
the same responsibilities and burdens This, he trusted, all
would assent to, and he entreated the members of the Senate
