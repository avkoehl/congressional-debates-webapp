Major General F. STEELE,

Kenner, La.:

My dispatch of yesterday is hereby modified so as to read Lakeport instead of Hicks Landing as the place of embarkation on Lake Pontchartrain. Besides the steamers Nashua and N. P. Banks, sent to you yesterday, the Belvidere and Peabody, with capacity for 2,200, will be sent you to- day. These steamers, together with those at Lakeport, will, it is supposed, suffice for all your infantry and for the following batteries: Fifteenth Massachusetts, Second Connecticut, Twenty- First and Twenty- sixth New York. Thus all your troops, except the Second Massachusetts, First Indiana, and seventeenth Ohio Batteries, will be disposed of. The choice of troops to be sent by sea and those to be sent via Lakeport is left to yourself.

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
