that she -w ill be But, Mr Chairman, when the I
South, if ever Heaven shall so order it, is beset
■with danger and with difficulty, the pride, the
chivalry, the southern feeling, and high character
of Virginia vwll be appealed to. 1 feel very con-
fident mv friend from South Carolina meant not
the slightest reflection upon her In the establish-
ment of navy-vards, if the Government is to be
regulated by suitable positions, there is not one
south of Virginia suited to the construction of vcs-
selsof the first class, forthe wantof harbors of suf-
ficient depth of water, so that in this point of view
all appropriations for this object have been prop-
erly made, although unequal in dollars and cents.
Virginia must be classed a southern State, and
the appropriations for her defenses southern ap-
propriations. Take the proposed appropriations
from the amount stated by the gentleman, take
also the pay and provisions of the officers and
sailors, which cannot be considered in the light
of local appropriations, and others of like char-
acter, ana the dispaiity will be greatly reduced;
yet, upon this point of appropriation, the advant-
age is favorable to the North. But the reason
of this disparity is obvious, and is accounted for
without the slightest imputation of favoritism
upon the Executive or either of the Departments
The inequality has been produced by nature. To
the North there are numerous bays, rivers, and
harbors, suited for navy-yards, having naturally
safe and sufficient depth of water; hence the navy-
yards have been principally established to the
North. There, too, were our principal maritime
towns which needed defenses. All these northern
navy-yards were established during the Admin-
istrations of southern Presidents, and have been
sanctioned by southern Representatives. I have
not gone into the minute details of inequality of
the gentleman from South Carolina, because they
depend upon the leading points, and will be cor-
rect or not, as they are correct.
While, however, navy-yards have been pro-
vided for to the North, the South has been pro-
vided for in fortifications; and in this branch of
public defense, the disparity of appropriation fa-
vorable to the South has heretofore Deen much
greater than the disparity favorable to the North
upon navy-yards. The annexed table, exhibited
by the honorable gentleman from Maine, [Mr.
Evans,] in his able discussion of this question,
gives the number of fortifications erected since the
foundation of the Government, and the expendí- i
ture on each, classed North and South by the I

It will be seen that there have been expended
South $8,043,591 46, and North $3,447,772 44,
leav ing a balance in favor of the South of $4,595,-
819 02, and here the gentleman from Maine drops
the calculation. In the appropriations now pro-
posed for repairs and improvements of navy-
yards, there is a balance in favor of the North of
$369,125. Upon all the works finished, under
construction, not finished, and proposed, the
expenditure will be, North, #18,000,425, South,
$16,530,054, leaving a balance in favor of the
North of $1,470,371. This disparity, however,
is the result of circumstances which cannot be
controlled, and of which we cannot complain.
But the true point upon which we have good cause
of complaint is the unconstitutional appropriation
for works of internal improvement, and the tyran-
nical and unequal operation of the tanfflaws. In
works of internal improvement, the honorable
gentleman from Maine [Mr. Evans] admits that
the advantage is greatly in favor of the North,
but charges the inequality upon the refusal of the
southern States to receive appropriations for such
objects. This is true, sir; true to the letter; Vir-
ginia has always regarded these appropriations as
unauthorized by the Constitution; and has re-
fused the beneficence of the Federal Government
founded in violation of that sacred compact. She
has acted upon that principle of integrity upon
which an honest man will refuse to receive stolen
goods. She will neither touch, taste, nor handle
the unclean thing. She will not listen to the ar-
gument addressed to her cupidity, that the States
believing the Federal Government has this power
under the Constitution are receiving yearly large
appropriations. She regards her integrity with
unyielding pertinacity, and will not surrender it
to considerations of avarice or cupidity. She will
not sell her integrity at any price. Hermotto is,
to do right, let others do wrong who will. I do
not doubt that gentlemen of the North honestly
believe that the Federal Government has this
power; yet I think they should have some respect
to the opinions of so many southern States, and
not be willing to clutch all they can get by a
strained construction of the powers of the Con-
stitution, although they may Deheve the doctrine
sound.
Mr. Chairman, our Yankee friends understand
how to manage these moneyed affairs better than
we do. They always have had, and I fear
always will have, the advantage of the South in
this particular; they know how fastidious south-
ern statesmen are in their construction of the
powers of the Constitution, and very generally
throw out some constitutional question for our
discussion; and, in its heat and excitement, carry
some scheme of appropriation without attracting
notice. I heard of a very sagacious northern
man who, upon a certain occasion, said that
when an appropriation was to be carried which
might excite opposition from the South, the
right plan was to give the southerners a consti-
tutional question for debate, and that, while that
was debating, the appropriation could be carried.
I think the history of our legislation proves very
clearly the success with which this stratagem
has been practiced.
Mr. Chairman, the framersof the Constitution
never contemplated that, in authorizing appro-
priations for the common defense, they were in-
corporating a principle of equality in dollars and
cents; and that when so many dollars were ex-
pended in one State, so many were to be expended
in another, whether needed or not. The object
was to defend the whole; and the only question
in making appropriations is, where are defenses
needed* In our extended territory, nature her-
self has created the inequality of which the
honorable gentleman complains. There are more
assailable points in one section than another,
which must be provided with defenses; and
hence this natural inequality necessarily pro-
duces inequality of expenditure. The only true
principle is to provide defenses for every point,
North or South, wherever needed, without re-
gard to any other consideration.
But my honorable friend from South Carolina
[Mr. Thompson] complains that under this Ad-
ministration the interests of the South, particu-
larly in its defenses, have been grossly neglected;
and, in order to account for it, refers to the loca-
tion of the present members of the Cabinet He
savs the Secretaries of the Tieawrv, of War
and of the Navy, are all from this favored region'
(the North,) and only the Secretary of State
from the South. The Secretaries of the Treasury
and of the Navy are from the North, but the
Secretary of "War is from a northwestern Terri-
tory, (Michigan.) But even taking them all three
from the North, upon the principle of population
and commerce the inequality does not exist, for
in addition to the Secretary of State, the chief
executive officer, the President—he who is charged
with the whole executive power, and controls ali
executive officers—is a southern man; so that I
think there is, on this ground, little cause of com-
plaint. But, Mr. Chairman, what I principally
complain of in this part of the honorable gentle-
man's argument is its tendency to create sectional
feelings, sectional jealousies, and sectional dis-
likes. I know the gentleman intended no such
effect. I only speak of the tendency of his argu-
ment, however honestly felt or designed. So
long as parties exist in name, extended over every
quarter of the Union, the integrity of the Union
is not hazarded, but it was against parties sep-
arated by geogiaphical lines, by sectional divis-
ions, that the paternal and warning voice of
Washington was raised, early in our history,
and against which the effort of every patriot ha<?
been, and will ever be, directed. Whenever the
geographical line shall be distinctly drawn, and
the parties shall be known as a northern and
southern party, then, indeed, there will be an
array of party which will ultimately sever the
Union, dissolve us into our original fragments,
destroy our free institutions, and produce that
state of anarchy, war, bloodshed, and despotism,
against which all our sages and patriots have
struggled, and to prevent which the Union was
formed.
I think there is no just ground to charge the
Government with neglecting the interests or de-
fenses of either Charleston or Pensacola (for there
seems to be no complaint elsewhere )   There is
proposed for Charleston, $----------: there have been
surveys and inquiries set afloat, as to the practi-
cability of constructing at Charleston a navy-
yard, and there is now a proposition depending
for that object before Congress, under the pat-
ronage of its own Representative, founded upon
the information communicated and recommended
by the Executive. For this appropriation I am
prepared to vote. The appropriations recom-
mended for Pensacola by the Navy Department,
are contained in the following letter, addressed to
me by the Department, containing also the course
pursued by the Department upon that subject:
Navy Department, February 12,1836.
Sir In answer to your letter requesting my view s as to
the expediency of constructing a dry dock, and of deep-
ening the channel over the bar at Pensacola, and request-
ing any information in this Department necessary to acor-
red decision on this subject, I have the honor to state that
the Secretary of the Navy, m his report of the 30th Novem-
ber, 1833, brought this subject before Congress by recom-
mending the continuance ot Pensacola as a naval station;
and submitting a report from Captain Dallas, on the means
and expense ot deepening a channel through that bar, and
a memoir and estimate on the improvement of that bar by
Captain W H Chase, of the Engineer corps, (to be found
in the first volume of cxecuUve documents of H R., 1st
session 23d Congress, No 1, page 26J )
Captain Chase calculated the expense of adding three
f^et to the depth of the channel over the bar at f 106,690.
The various items of expense are given in detail in his esti-
mate Captain Dallas, however, is of opinion that th«
channel over the bar should be made six feet lower than at
present, and adds $40,000 to the estimate of Captain Chase,
making the whole expense amount to $14C,690, for deepen-
ing the channel six feet, and giving a depth of water over
the bar of from twenty nine and a half to thirty feet, which
will be amply sufficient for our vessels of the largest class.
These gentlemen are very capable of making the observa-
tions and estimates which they have submitted, and there
is no reason to doubt the accuracy of their calculations;
and I have no hesitation in expressing my opinion, that the
great importance of Pensacola, as a naval station, would
justify the expenditure of the sum estimated for the object
stated
Annexed to mv last annual report will be found estimates
for buildings of different kinds at the Pensacola navy yard,
to the amount of $64,000 ; for building a powder magazine
near the yard, $17,000 In addition to which,tbere are tne
