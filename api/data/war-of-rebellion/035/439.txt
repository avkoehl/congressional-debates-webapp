Do you think it can be done with that force? What information have you as to the force in East Tennessee now? Our cavalry ought to be on the railroad at or near Loudon Bridge to-night.

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, June 19, 1863.

Brigadier-General WHITE,

Paintville, Ky., via Catlettsburg:

It will be impossible to send 500 more infantry to Louisa, as you request. You must make the most of the force that you have. Move rapidly, but cautiously. Do not allow yourself to be cut off or to run upon a force too large for you. I fear the delay will give the enemy notice of your movements. Our force from Mount Sterling attacked the command that made the raid upon Maysville at Triplett's Bridge, completely routing them, capturing a large number of prisoners and horses. There are some reports of a considerable rebel force assembling at Abingdon. You have better means of learning that than we.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, June 19, 1863.

Major-General HARTSUFF, Lexington, Ky.:

Repeat information from Gilbert to Carter, and direct him to take a bold reconnaissance in the direction of Jamestown, Ten., or even as far as that place. With a view to aiding Sanders and to communicate with Sanders by courier.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

SOMERSET, June 19, 1863. (Received 4.50.)

General STURGIS:

Have received a long telegram from Colonel Gilbert, at London, giving details of his operations in Whitley County. As it was also addressed to you, I presume you have received it. General Hartsuff ordered this a. m. that, if Colonel Gilbert should be found in the vicinity of Boston, he was to halt there, if possible, or even advance, so as to aid Colonel Sanders. Couriers were sent out, but the mounted force of Colonel Gilbert was too far its return to obey the order of the general. If the general desires it, they can soon return.

CARTER,

Brigadier-General.

SOMERSET, June 19, 1863.

General STURGIS:

Colonel Reily, of the One hundred and fourth Ohio, telegraphed from Mount Vernon that some of the men who were with Colonel Gilbert say that he and Colonel Sanders passed through Big Creek Gap at 2 p. m. on Tuesday, and went into Powell's Valley. They had a slight skirmish 15 miles this side of Jacksborough. I am sending orders.

S. P. CARTER,

Brigadier-General.
