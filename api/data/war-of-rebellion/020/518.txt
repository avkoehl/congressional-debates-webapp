RICHMOND, May 23, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON:

Send a good brigade selected from troops of upper part of Georgia and South Carolina that could not stand summer's campaign on coast; a brigadier-general selected by you to report here without delay.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE.

MARION, S. C., May 23, 1862.

Major-General PEMBERTON:

Reliable information has been received that four of the enemy's gunboats were 15 miles above Georgetown last night, in the Waccamaw River. There are really no militia in this region to be ordered out, and with a small force the railroad at Fair Bluff can be approached and destroyed. Whether the boats can pass the obstructions on the Pee Dee remains to be tested. I go there forthwith.

Very respectfully,

W. W. HARLLEE.
HEADQUARTERS SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA, Charleston, May 24, 1862.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,Commanding Second Military District:

GENERAL: General W. W. Harllee telegraphs me that reliable information has been received that four of the enemy's gunboats were 15 miles above Georgetown, in the Waccamaw River. It is very desirable if possible to prevent the destruction of the railroad at Fair Bluff or Santee. I wish you to send eight companies of infantry and a section of field artillery by rail toward Santee or Fair Bluff, as the case may require, well equipped for the temporary service. The commander of this force should be a perfectly reliable person. On arrival he will report the condition of affairs and act as emergencies may require.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, May 24, 1862.

Gov. FRANCIS W. PICKENS:
