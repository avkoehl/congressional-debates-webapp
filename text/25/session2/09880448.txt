ney from the State corporations, and cast upon the
Executive Department a wide discretion in the
mode and manner of keeping the funds of the na-
tion *Tne deposite act of 1836 did not contém-
plale or provide for a crisis such as that which oc-
cuned The probability of the refusal of some one
of the selected deposite banks to redeem their pa-
per was foreseen, and provision made in the eighth
section for such a contingency It was enacted
"0¡ if any of the said banks shall at any time refuse
to pay its own notes in specie, if demanded," "tt shall
be the duty of the Secretary of the Treasury to discon-
tinue any such bank as a depository, and withdraw
from it the public moneys which %t may hold on depO'
site " This was the law It was obeyed No dis-
cretun tas left to the Secretary The connection
was wholly dissolved The Executive Depart-
ment is not chargeable with the dissolution If it
is again to exist, it mus* be re-established by a new
reunion, consummated by law So, also, the non-
reception of the notes of banks refusing to redeem
their issues, m payment of debts due the Govrn-
ment, was produced by operation of law, and not
by the volition of the Éxecutiv e branch oí the Go-
vernment The act of 1789, the resolution of
1816, and the act of 1836, were imperative, and
forbid the officers of the Government to receive, m
paymen of its dues, any mconverlMe paper, issued
either by the State sovereignties or banking corpo-
rations In a Federative Repub ic, organized un-
der a written Constitution, of limited powers, it
would present a singular anomaly, closely allied
to despotism, to clothe ministerial officers with the
poner of dispensing with positive laws It is
equally foreign to the character of our institutions
to coriile immense disci et to nary powers in the hands
of the Executive A jealous limitation of the con-
tiol of the Executive over the finances of tne na-
tion, is a principle coeval with the Republican sys-
tem The framers of that admirable chart of our
liberty, the Constitution, recognised this safeguard
of our Government in the provision that "no mo-
ney shall be drawn from the Treasury except in
pursuance of appropriations made bj law " Deep-
ly impressed with the truth of these positions, I
cannot consent to forbear making an effc rt to place
the safe keeping of the public monevs under the
regulations and restrictions of law, during the pre-
sent session, and thus limit the power of the Exec-
utive over the finances of the nation
Two plans of accomplishing the object of ta-
king the public money out of the immediate con-
trol of the Exscutive branch and placing it under
the custody of the laws, has been submitted to the
consideration of the people and Congress, first,
to )evn e and lesuscitate the union of the Slate banks
with the Treasury Department on principles allied to
thoie of the deposite act of 1836, secondly, to protide
fot the entue separation between the Government and
the banks No proposition for the cieation of a
National Bank to be made the fiscal agent of the
Treasury Depaitment, has been submitted for tne
consideration of Congress or the people The
question is narrowed down to the two positions
stated which shall we select The solution of
this important inquiry involves momentous inte-
rests in its decision, deeply affecting the future des-
tinies oí the people, the States and the Union
Its magnitude is felt and acknowledged, the high re-
sponsibilities underwhich we act recognised isone
can deny the disasters which have been entaded
upon our countij, duiing and immediately suc-
ceeding the period that State banks were used as
fiscal agents of the Government The connection
prov ed alike unfortunate to the peop'e, the Govern-
ment and the banks On both occasions, w hen
State banks were resorted to as fiscal agents, the

ment has the people to try a third experiment,
based on similar principles with two former ones,
w hich utterly failed?
The evil is in the system, and not in the period
when the experiment has been tried     This admo-
nishes us of their insecurity, and inability to sUc
cessfully perform the necessary functions of the
financial agency of the Government    The defect
is m their organic structure, and hence the hopeless
ness of amendment.    When money <s abundant,
all who have the command of it use it ímproví-
dently    The Government, with all Us checks and
balances, cannot be restrained from doing the same
Bank directors and officers are not exempt from
this general frailty of our nature   they are usually
the largest borrowers and prime operators m bank
credits    Next, they accommodate their friends    It
is the interest of banks to lend, and borrowers think
it their interest to obtain money to invest in specu-
lations, the profits of which are generally over-esti-
mated    The tide rolls on, until the mass of the
communit) are drawn into the vortex    No one
dreams of the reflux, except here and there a soli-
tary individual,  who is termed a croaking raven,
behind the age ir v hich he lives.    This is human
nature, which no wise statesman will overlook, in
framing a system of government    Opeiated upon
by such causes, no Treasury contrivance by the
General Government can impose upen the State
banks,   whose existence is .ndependent of their
power, sufficient obligations, or offer sufficient u-
ducements, to repel the infectious influence of the
trading mania,   when at flood tide  and until that
can be accomplished,  the puohc money will not
only be unsafe in the State banks, but it will greatly
enhance the dangei of the r insecurity    They wovli
be much more sound and bensfie al to th' country
without, than with it     The  occasional fluctuations
of internal exchanges will occur, nader any system
of financial arrangements   by this Government,
The ev idence of the last year has given a remark-
able instance of the utter inability of State banks,
when connected wuh the Treasury Department, to
preserve uniformity of exchange     A memorable
instance of the failure of the United States Bank
to secure the same desirable uniformity, occurs in
the past history of internal exchange,  from the
5 ear 1817 up to  1821; during which period the
western banks, and most of their enterprising men,
were prestrated, the  Bank of the United States
itself, reduced to  the very verge of bankruptcy
and compelled to suspend and w md up some of
its branches, partieularh one m Cincinnati.  The
convulsions of that period overwhelmed   whole
masses m the Middle and Western States with ram,
and as it respected this   Government, termina-
ted in   its  relinquishment ct  upwards   oí  ¡wet¡
ty one   million*   of   debt   due   ioi   ihe   sale   of
public land, and an accumulation of upwards of
one million and a half of dollars of unavailable funds
m the Treasury, in the notes of 5< oktn banks    Af-
ter the evil had fallen upon  us, and  the mischief
was done, the Government interfered      At the in-
stance of the Chief Magistrate, lie tien president
of the bank resigned, and Mr Cn°v es was placed
