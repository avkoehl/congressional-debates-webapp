supplies by the Tennessee and overtake me at Florence. The railroad is a nuisance, and I find the Tennessee in fine order, good for 8 feet up to Eastport, Chickasaw, and Waterloo. I tried Colbert Shoals to-day with a gun-boat of 4 feet, but we could not pass. We must haul from Waterloo till I can get a boat to Florence.

Major-General REYNOLDS:

Troops just moving out. Schurz leads, followed by Steinwehr and Geary. They fear the pontoon train will be in their way. There has been much difficulty in getting this train across the island and up the southern shore of the river.

[General J. J. REYNOLDS:]

GENERAL: A deserter who came in a short time ago, late this evening, says:

First. He has been up from Atlanta but about one week; was quartermaster's clerk for a while there.

Second. The rebels have been in line of battle the greater part of to-day.

Third. Longstreet's men crossed the mountain to-day (Lookout).

Fourth. That we are to be attacked in the morning.

He can give no substantial reasons for the last report, only that it is the talk and belief in camp.

Truly,

FULLERTON,
