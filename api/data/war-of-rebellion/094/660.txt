Major-General FORREST,Commanding,&amp;c.:

General Hood directs me to say that he has received your suggestion, through Lieutenant-Colonel Henry, of falling back a little to give the enemy a chance of going toward Lebanon if they will. General Hood thinks the idea a good one, and to strike them while they are moving.

MOBILE, December 7, 1864,

Lieutenant-General TAYLOR,

Montgomery:

Hear from my scouts and Gardner that enemy, 4,000, crossed Pearl River on the 4th. Seems approaching railroad about Shubuta. Gardner has sent about 500 men, Clanton's brigade, and gone to Corinth to-day. If not threatened here I can send McCulloch and Maury, who are ready to move as soon as route of enemy ascertained. I have ordered the prisoners to be moved from Meridian at once; stores to be ready to move command of all militia and other forces at Meridian, Shubuta, and Bucatunna. Gardner reports to-night he can send no forces from above Meridian. I have telegraphed him if Corinth not threatened to send all available. Last report of enemy is approaching Ellisville, west of Bucatunna.

D. H. MAURY,

Major-General, Commanding.
