April 8, moved from Pleasant Hill at 5 a.m., marching about 12 miles, when we were ordered to proceed at the double-quick to the field, a distance of 3 miles. The field was soon reached, and we went into position in a plowed field on the left of the road. We remained there but a few moments, when we were ordered to take position on the right of the road at the edge of the woods. Here we did some very sharp firing and succeeded in keeping the enemy in check for a short time, but being unsupported, we were eventually obliged to fall back. We then took position some distance back at the edge of the woods, which we held for some time, and were then ordered to limber up and get into the road, as the retreat had by that time become general. We succeeded in getting the pieces all off the field, but the road being blockaded by the wagons we were compelled to leave them. Our loss was 1 officer killed, 1 wounded, and 2 prisoners; 1 enlisted man killed, 2 wounded, and 21 prisoners. The battery fired in all about 250 rounds. April 9, we started from Pleasant Hill, reaching Grand Ecore on the 11th, where we have been in camp since.
