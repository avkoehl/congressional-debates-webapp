about 100 yards in advance, the men protecting themselves with rails, &amp;c. Heavy firing on both sides was kept up until about 4 p.m. Whilst holding this line the enemy charged twice, but was repulsed, with heavy loss, both times. The brigade was again moved forward, in conjunction with the whole line, driving the enemy before them in the greatest confusion. Without any further check we passed through Winchester and had the honor of placing our flags first on the heights beyond Winchester. The brigade captured many prisoners, who were sent under guard to the rear.

In this connection I cannot bestow too much praise upon all the members of my staff, they being untiring in their efforts to rally the men under heavy fire, and by their actions inspiring the men with courage. I mention with pleasure the following-named officers, all of whom distinguished themselves by their gallantry: Captain Charles H. Leonard, assistant adjutant-general; Captain Hiram W. Day, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain Charles M. Bartruff, acting aide-de-camp; Lieutenant John A. Hicks, acting aide-de-camp; Lieutenant Benjamin F. Miller, acting aide-de-camp. I would also mention Sergt. Major Nathan F. Peck, One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers, who came under my immediate observation and was conspicuous in reforming the men. Among others, the brigade mourns the loss of the gallant Major Dillingham, of the Tenth Vermont Volunteers. The loss in both officers and men was severe. A list of casualties has been forwarded.*

About dark we were ordered to fall back to Winchester and camp for the night on the right of General Getty's division.

September 20 received orders to move forward at 5 a.m. in the direction of Strasburg. When within a mile of Strasburg went into camp and remained all night, the enemy occupying Fisher's Hill. On Wednesday, September 21, at 12.30 p.m., moved by the right flank around Strasburg about two miles; threw up earth-works and remained all night. Thursday, September 22, in the morning about 11 o'clock, received orders to move out with the Second Brigade and take a certain hill in our front. This was successfully done, this brigade forming the second line. About 4 p.m., General Crook having turned the enemy's left, we were ordered by Captain Smith, acting assistant adjutant-general, to move forward, connecting with General Crook's left. The command moved steadily forward under a heavy artillery fire, obliquing to the right until we passed a piece of woods in our front, when the command made a rush into the works on the right of the Second Brigade and captured three brass pieces and one steel piece. The credit of capturing these pieces belongs to the Tenth Vermont Volunteers and One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers. The One hundred and sixth New York Volunteers claims to have captured one Parrott gun. The enemy fell back in great confusion and many prisoners were captured, who were sent to the rear.

All officers and men did their duty. I take pleasure in mentioning two instances of personal bravery brought to my notice, viz: First Lieutenant E. E. Russell, of the One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers, who drove a rebel lieutenant from a gun with his saber as he was putting in a fuse to fire it. Private David Robinson, Company B, One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers, fought desperately hand to hand with the enemy over a gun, being knocked down with the butt of a musket. He, however, succeeded in killing his opponent. First Sergt. Julius Ambruster, Company E, One hundred and fifty-first New York Volunteers, is also very highly spoken of by the com-
