General A. PLEASONTON,

Commanding Cavalry, Philomont, Va.:

GENERAL: General Averell left Berlin for the Virginia shore to-day. In view of the large force you seem to have before you, Averell has been ordered to join you to-morrow with a horse battery. He will have over 1,000 men, and I think with them you should hold Mr. Stuart somewhat uneasy. I do not know the exact position of Averell to-night, but I think my orderly will find him. You will have a plenty of infantry to-morrow.

Respectfully,

R. B. MARCY,

Chief of Staff.

General W. W. AVERELL,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

GENERAL: General Pleasonton has been ordered to move forward to-morrow morning to the Manassas Gap Railroad, near Springfield. General Couch, now at Woodgrove, will move on the Snickersville, and if he finds Snikcer's Gap occupied by the enemy he will ttack and carry it, being supported by General Porter's corps in his rear. General Couch will then throw forward one division to the Ashby's Gap and Aldie road, near Upperville. General Burnside will occupy Bloomfield, Union, and Philomont, with General Reynolds' corps on his left and one division advanced to Middleburg. The commanding general directs that you throw forward your cavalry early in the morning to ascertain if the enemy hold Snicker's Gap, and give General Couch the information. If you should not be necessarily detained at Snicker's Gap, you will please push on to Ashby's Gap, and examine that locality, so as to give General Couch information concerning that. Should you find that General Pleasonton is engaged with the enemy in advance of you, you will push on to his assistance.
