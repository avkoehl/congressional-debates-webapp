I send by the Rattler all the ammunition I have-about 230,000 rounds-and have telegraphed from Cairo to fill Sherman's call.

Things appear dark, for there is no question Sherman has to meet more than his own force. I am assured that a large part of Pemberton's army is there, moving in that direction as soon as Grant fell back.

We have an abundance of commissary supplies here, but nothing of ordnance. It would of commissary supplies here, but nothing of ordnance. It would be a most wretched casualty if Sherman's force should run out of ammunition.

I have here ow 2,400 sick, and the best I can do for the prisoners on the Minnehaha is to ship them up to Cairo.

Let me constantly have the last news.

Your obedient servant,

[S. A. HURLBUT,]

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS POST OF BOLIVAR,Bolivar, Tenn., January 3, 1863.

Colonel JOHN A. RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: For information of Major-General Grant I inclose on next page a statement of my forces.

Of the Forty-third Illinois, Sixty-first Illinois, and Forty-third Ohio (at least 380), and all of the Twelfth Michigan are on special duty, leaving only about 460 for sudden call.

The absence of the First West Tennessee with General Dodge leaves me about 45 mounted men; they inexperienced.

I wish it understood that with my present force, small as it is, I can retire within the fortifications and repel any attack. But to do this it might be necessary to compromise the safety of the town, and as now circumscribed as to cavalry I cannot pursue or drive away the hostile forces that hover around and annoy us in a provoking manner.

Yours, &amp;c.,

M. BRAYMAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
