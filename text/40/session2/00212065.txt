1868.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBS.
mm'
Mr. ELDRIDGE. All the more reason for
believing it is impartial.
Mr. WILSON, of lojva. It seems so. It
gives as much attention to that side as it does
to this, but it did not understand the facts.
If members on the other side of the House
were absent we could not wait for their return ;
if compelled to await their presence they might
stop all legislation. Therefore I submit that
the authority he has presented is very much
against him and his friends. Why was not
the gentleman here attending to his public
duties ?
Mr. WOOD. I did not suspect a trick.
Mr. ELDKIDGE. 1 have given the reason
why I was absent.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. The gentleman
says he did not suspect a trick. What right
had he to be absent, even though he did not
suspect a trick? His constituents expect him
to attend to their business and the affairs of
the country in the House. Instead of that he
absents himself from the House and neglects
his public duties. His constituents have a
right to find fault with him if he absents him-
,self in this way. [Laughter.]
Mr. WOOD. I never will give my consent
hereafter to anything, not even when courtesy
would seem to demand it.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. The gentleman
loses his temper. [Laughter.] If he will only
continue that practice of neglecting and be-
traying his constituents he will not need to
consent to anything. If, however, he shall
discharge his duty by remaining here he will
have an opportunity, as he might have had
when this bill was taken from the Speaker's
table, to make objection.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I think the gentleman
from New York [Mr. Wood] made quite as
severe a confession in the opening of his re-
marks as the lecture of the gentleman from
Iowa. [Laughter.]
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I think he deserves
both. [Laughter.]
Mr. WOOD. You have not answered that
article in the New York Times.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. Oh, no;' the gen-
tleman himself will not indorse that because it
strikes his friends quite as much as it does any-
one on this side. Let the Times scold.
Again, the bill went to the Senate. Were
all the Democratic Senators absent ? Why was
it not challenged there? Why did not some
of the gentlemen who, like the gentleman from
New York were absent, after returning to the
Hall and ascertaining the nature of this amend-
ment inform some Democratic Senators of this
"trick" which had been perpetrated in their
absence from their seats? If that had been
done there might have been afull discussion in
the Senate, for there there is no limit to debate
except that of physical endurance. Bat, in-
stead of its being arrested in its passage there,
Senators were as dumb and perhaps as absent
as members of the Htfuse.
But before the roll-call was finally completed
on the passage of the bill in the Senate, the
vote being taken by yeas and nays, we find that
there were a number of Democratic Senators
present. Now, their attention must have been
called to that amendment, otherwise they would
not have demanded the yeas and nays. Where
a matter is not deemed important they do not
call theytas and nays on its passage; but Dem-
ocratic Senators present deemed this so import-
ant that, having at their disposition unlimited
time for discussion, they merely demanded the
yeas and nays on the passage and all the Dem-
ocrats voted against it. \\ by ? It must have
been because they understood it. Wecertainly
will not charge them with voting against athing
they did not understand. That would be quite
as unfair as it would be to charge the gentle-
man from New York, who was absent on this
occasion, with being absent all the time. There-
fore I will not make any charge against the
Senators any more than against the gentleman
from New York.
Mr. BOYER. I would inform the gentle-
man that I believe there was opposition made
to it in the Senate, so far, at all events, as to
inquire in reference to the nature of it, but no
explanation was given. The vote was imme-
diately afterward taken, and I believe the yeas
and nays were called on the passage of the bill
by the Senator from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Buck-
alew.]
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. I do not know for
what purpose that explanation is interpolated.
Is it for the purpose of showing that Demo-
cratic Senators were quite as unable to under-
stand that amendment when it was adopted as
members of this House were when it was being
read? [Laughter.] Oris it for the purpose
of showing that they, too, disregarded the in-
terests of the people, their constituents, and
ha'd abandoned attention to public affairs?
Mr. BOYER. If it will do the gentleman
from Iowa [Mr. Wilson] any good I will con-
fess, for my own part, that the members of the
minority of this House were not as attentive
as the proceedings in the particular matter we
are discussing show they ought to have been ;
and I will say further to the gentleman that he
may be assured that it is not necessary for him
further to lecture the members of the minority
upon that point.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. Then I will desist.
Mr. BOYER. The lesson he and the gen-
tleman from Ohio [Mr. Schsnck] have taught
us will not be lost either upon us or upon the
country.
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. That is to say, the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Boyer]
will hereafter be more attentive to his public
duties thau he was on that occasion.
Mr. BOYER, And less confiding*
Mr. WILSON, of Iowa. But I must inter-
pose a defense for some members on that side
of the House, and particularly the gentleman
from Indiana, [Mr. Niblack,] who is always
attentive to his duties, and that is that he
neither deserves a lecture on this occasion nor
needs any defense from, the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr. Boyer.] The gentleman
from Indiana has stated in his own behalf that
he understood the nature of the amendment,
and yefc he did not think it was necessary to
consume the time of the House in opposing it. \
Mr. Speaker, I have done.
TREATY-MAKING POWER THE PUBLIC LANDS.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. Mr. Speaker,
I take this occasion to say to the House that I
will at the earliest time, when it may be in
order, submit for consideration the following:
Resolved, That the Committee on the Judiciary be
instructed to inquire and report whether public lands
sold under treaties with Indian tribes are held by a
valid title, and whether such lands can besold except
in pursuance of a law duly enacted by Congress.
And I will present now very briefly some of
the reasons in support of the resolution, so that
the House may know in advance the grounds
upon which I will ask its adoption. The am-
ple discussions in Congress on the subject of
the public lands have demonstrated the wisdom,
the justice, and the expediency of so disposing
of them as to secure their sale to actual settlers.
Notwithstanding this there have been, and yet
are, many and plausible pretexts for disposing
of the public lands so as to place them in large
tracts in the hands of monopolists and specu-
lators, who grow rich at the expense of the toil-
ing millions, and impoverish the agricultural
classes by the exorbitant prices demanded and
received when the lands are sold.
Among the modes more recently adopted of
disposing of the public lands in this unjust and
ruinous mode is that of selling them by virtue
of treaty stipulations with Indian tribes, and
without any act of Congress to authorize it.
I have procured from the Commissioner of
Indian Alfairs a table, as follows:
Schedule showing salt of Indian Trust Lands from January 1. 1864, to January 1, 1808.
