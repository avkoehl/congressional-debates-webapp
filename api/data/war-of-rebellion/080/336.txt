HDQRS. TWENTY-EIGHTH MASSACHUSETTS VOLUNTEERS,August 9, 1864.

Respectfully submitted.

The above list of casualties and brief history of the part taken by this regiment has been compiled very hastily from a diary kept by First Lieutenant M. Binney, and the haste in which it was made up must excuse many imperfections in grammar and chirography; chronologically it is believed to be correct, and the casualties also correct.

JAMES FLEMING,

Captain, Commanding Twenty-eighth Massachusetts Volunteers.

Report of operations on the north bank of the James River by the Twenty-eighth Regiment Massachusetts Volunteers, from the 26th to the 30th of July, and from the 13th to the of August, 1864, with a list of casualties in each case, in compliance with circular from headquarters First Brigade.

About 3 p. m. of the 26th of July, 1864, the Twenty-eighth Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry, Major James Fleming commanding, broke camp before Petersburg, Va., marched with the brigade (the First of the First Division. Second Army Corps) to Deep Bottom, Va. Arrived there about 2 a. m. of the 27th instant. The march was very hurried and exhausting. Shortly after daybreak the regiment was deployed as skirmishers, occupying the right of the line the One hundred and eighty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers being in the center, and the Fifth New Hampshire Volunteers on the left. While the Fifth New Hampshire and One hundred and eighty-third Pennsylvania Volunteers were hotly engaged with the enemy in front the Twenty-eighth Massachusetts Volunteers succeed in on their flank, causing them to retire in confusion from their breast-works, leaving in our hands four 24-pounder Parrot guns with caissons and ammunition. This command also captured several prisoners, among them one commissioned officer. During the remainder of the day the regiment was on picket till evening, when it was relieved.

Just before dark the 28th instant the regiment moved back to the New Market road and assisted in throwing up a line of works.
