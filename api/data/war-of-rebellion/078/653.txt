BLUE MOUNTAIN, June 15, 1864.

Colonel MEAD:

I am now at this place in command of all the cavalry of North Alabama. Your command belongs to my organization by orders of Government. I wish you to bring it out and report here, that you men may be armed, equipped, and mustered into the service. Owing to the great scarcity of supplies you cannot keep in any one position until it is all ready. You had better send your men out in companies or squads of any size. Here their wants can be supplies until you come yourself. You shall have all the men you send out to me. As soon as I am strong enough to go forward I shall proceed north, cross the river, and deliver your people. Unless your men come out and help to bring there the army we can never go forward and relieve the country of the river. Your people know me and know that they can depend on what I say.

Your friend,

GID. J. PILLOW,

Brigadier-General, C. S. Army.
