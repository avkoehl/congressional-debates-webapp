I have ordered Company P, Sixth Virginia, from Wheeling to Rowlesburg, temporarily. Have also requested General Bunker to send three companies State militia. Have detachment of Carlin's men here to man the 6-pounder brass gun. The Gilmer County affair was Chewning's horse-thieves. All quiet in front, so far as I know.

N. WILKINSON,

Colonel WILKINSON:

COLONEL: I would most respectfully report to-day everything quiet. After our pickets were fired upon we sent out detachment of our company, who scouted the country for ten miles around and found that the whole affair was occasioned by a supposed gang of horse-thieves, who were prowling around and happened to run on our pickets. I will do all in my power to have them captured. Mair-carrier from Glenville reports all quiet there.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. DONOHUE,
