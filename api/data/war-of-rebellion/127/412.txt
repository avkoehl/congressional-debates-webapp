CONFEDERATE STATES OF AMERICA, WAR DEPARTMENT,

June 30, 1861.

SIR: In the presence of public danger precautionary measures are always wise. However confident of success an Administration may be, a failure to provide for all casualties that may possibly arise can never be pardoned. The fortunes of war are as various and changeable as are the talents and abilities of those conducting its operations. The Government of the Confederate States has no misgivings as to the future success of our arms and interprets no omen as presaging defeat. Nevertheless, the President deems it prudent, if not essential to the public safety, to form and organize a reserved army corps of 30,000 men, and to apportion to

--- the quota of ---. Your Excellency will therefore received for the war --- men, by independent companies, each company to be composed of 1 captain, 1 first lieutenant, 2 second lieutenants, 4 sergeants, 4 corporals, 2 musicians, and from 64 to 100 privates. For this purpose you are authorized to establish two camps of instruction at accessible points, where you will order these companies to rendezvous, and where they will be mustered into service by companies. These camps of instruction will be under the control of this Department, and the President will assign competent officers to take charge of them, the object being to drill and discipline the men. From time to time the President will organize these companies in battalions or regiments, as he may prefer, and will appoint the field officers and the staff. It will not be a prerequisite to accepting these companies that they shall be armed, although it is hoped that many of them will be. In addition to the above requisition the Confederate States will need from --- two companies of cavalry, numbering from 60 to 100 men each, in order to complete the army corps contemplated by the President. These companies of cavalry, when furnished, will rendezvous, with like companies from other States, at Corinth, in Mississippi, and not at the camps of instruction in ---. All the companies of cavalry there collected will be drilled by suitable officers and prepared for active and efficient service in the field. They must be armed and equipped to be received. Each company of cavalry should consist of 1 captain, 1 first lieutenant, 2 second lieutenants, 4 sergeants, 4 corporals, 1 farrier, 1 blacksmith, 2 musicians, and from 60 to 100 privates.

Very respectfully,

L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War.
