These reports show that for the years 1861
and 1862, the first two years of Secretary
Chase, i here are no discrepancies in the amount
of the debt as stated by the Secretary and
by the Register; they agree to a cent—to a
will.
In the statement for 1863, Register Chitten-
den states the debt at $123,000,000 less than
is stated by the Secretary. 1 do not pretend
to explain this startling contradiction. Here
are the figures; let him who thinks he can
explain them try it. Daring the five succeed-
ing years the statements of the amount of the
debt at the close of each financial year agree
to a farthing—they do not differ by a mill; but
in the reports for 1869 and 1870 we find large
discrepancies between the statements of Sec-
retary Boutwell and Register Allison. For
1869 the Register's statement is $167,000,000
less than the Secretary's, and for 1870 it is
$94,000,000 less. And thus vanishes into air
the theory of my colleague [Mr. Garfield]
that the Register's statement of the debt should
be larger than the Secretary's. The fact is
they ought to balance, and in seven years out
of the ten, from 1861 till 1870, both included,
they do absolutely balance, and strange to
say, in the three years where discrepancies
do exist, the Register's statement of the
amount of the debt is the smallest, instead
of the largest, as my friend imagines it ought
to be.
I hold in my hand the annual reports of Sec-
retary Boutwell for 1869 arid 1870. In' his re-
port for 1869 (page 29) be states the amount
of the debt in that year at $2,656,000,000, and
in his report for 1870 (page 25) he places the
debt in 1869—the very same year—at $2,588,-
000.000—a discrepancy between the two re-
ports for the same year of more than $68,000,-
000. So that Secretary Boutwell and Register
Allison.not only contradict each other as to
the amount of the debt in 1869 and 1870, but
in his report for 1870, Secretary Boutwell con-
tradicts his own report for 1869. From which
it would seem that the Secretary himself does
not know what is the true amount of the pub
lie debt. Indeed, I find that Secretary Bout-
well's report for 1871 is disproved by Secre-
tary Chase as to the amount of the public debt
for 1861,1862, and 1863 ; by Secretary Fessen-
den as to the amount of the debt in 1864 ; by
Secretary McCulloch as to the amount of the
debt for the years 1865, 1866,1867, and 1868;
and by Secretary Boutwell's own report for
1869; thus showing discrepancies in Secretary
Boutwell's report for 1871 amounting to more
than three hundred and six million dollars ;
which more clearly appears from the following
table:

* The statements for 1870 and 1871 agree, but are forced.
I hold in my hand a circular lately issued
by Mr. Boutwell, under the titleofthe "Reduc-
tion of the National Debt of the United States,"
in which the Secretary says "the foregoing is
a correct statement ot the public debt, as ap-
pears from the books and Treasurer's returns
in the Department, at the close of business on
January 81, 1872." Now, in this circular,
sent out by the Secretary of the Treasury only
the other day, he gives the debt on the 1st day
42d Cong. 2d Sess.—No. 4.
of July, 1871, at $2,292,030,834. That was
the statement of the amount of the debt on the
30th of June, 1871, the fiscal year ending on
that day.
Now, sir, allow me to call the attention of
my honorable friend and of the members of
this committee to the figures. My friend [Mr.
Garfield] says that the Secretary of the Treas-
ury deducts from the amount of the public
debt the amount of cash on hand. What does
this statement say? "Debt of the* United
States less the cash in the Treasury." The
report of the Secretary of the Treasury for
1871 gives the amount of the public debt July
1, 1871, at $2,353,211,332, making a discrep-
ancy between the statement of the Secretary
and the statement of the Treasurer as to the
amount of the debt July 1, 1871, of more than
sixty-one million dollars. Hence we see that
the Secretary of the Treasury contradicts his
own statements, the Register of the Treasury
contradicts the Secretary of the Treasury, and
the Treasurer contradicts them both; for,
strange to say, t"he Secretary and Register
agree to a dime as to the amount of the pub-
lic debt in their reports for 1871, which result
is obtained by force, and not by arithmetic.
And I will be highly gratified if the honorable
Secretary himself, or any representative of
the Administration on this floor, will give
any explanation of this remarkable state of
facts.
Mr. Chairman, I now propose to apply
another test as to the reliability of the official
statements of the Treasury Department. I
hold in my hand Mr. Boutwell's financial rer
port for 1870, and I find that, the Secretary
and Register contradict each other as to the
amount of the debt, in every year, without one
exception, from 1861 t,o 1870, both years in-
cluded. My colleague [Mr. Garfield] would
say, "That is all right; the Register's report
of the debt, should always be greater than the
amount stated by the Secretary, inasmuch,"
says my colleague, "as the Secretary deducts
the cash on hand, and the Register does not."
But it so happens that, in five years of the ten
the amount stated by the Secretary is the
largest, and in the five other years the amount
stated.by the Register is the largest, so that
rule does not work. This table, however, will
make the facts better understood.
The statement of the public debt made by
Secretary Boutwell, in his annual report for
1870, is contradicted by the report of the
Register of the Treasury for the same year,
as shown by the following statement:

Thus is it shown by the financial'report
for 1870 that discrepancies exnt between the
statements of the debt as made by the Secre-
tary and Register for the same ten years,
