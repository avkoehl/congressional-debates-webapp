CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
propínate occasion than the present. This is an
extraordinary convocation of Congress, and it was
•just as important to make use of it lo guard against
contingencies known to threaten the country, as
to devote its at'enlion'exclusively to measures that
might be much more appropriately discussed at
a regular session But it is said it is the proper
time to determine whether an inquiry shall be in-
stituted into the expediency of purchasing sites for
forts which may be erected and probably with great
expedition may be available s,ome th'ee years
hence; yet it is not rte proper time to prepare for
the contingency of hostilites with a neighboring
power which may occur during the recess between
this extraordinary session and the next session of
Congress. Now, in the event of collision with
this neighboring power, where are we to ex-
pect the first b'ows will be struck? On our
lake frontier most certainly. The only possible
objection then to the amendment is that it does not
go far enough—that it does not provide for arming
the vessels of all the lakes. He should, tnerefore,
suggest Le propriety of modifying it, so that the
sum apprapnated «hall be at the disposal of tne
President of the United Sta'es incase of need, to
be app'ied to the charter and armament of Sich
vessels on the lakes as may be required. There
can be no provision in this law more directly call-
ed for than that of appropriating funds, not Jor the
immediate construction of vessels of war, but for
the employment and equipment of vessels already
built, m defence of the country, should occasion
require it Tins lake coast in the State ot New
York alone extends three hundred milei. The
British Government has at its command vessels,
not slightly built like ours, but fit for war at a mo-
ment'^ notice. Trie steamboat Gieat Britain has
been already purchased by the provincial Govern-
ment. This vessel draws eleven feet of water.
It is a fortification in itse'f.
He (Mr Wright) was aware that the American
vessels on the lakes were slightly built, in compa-
rison; but he knew th< t they could be armed and
equipped for defence, though not perhap, well
adapted for attack Although not, pioperly speak-
ing, capable of being made war vessels, they would
be of immense advantage in transporting troops and
ordnance to points necessary to protect. It was
also probable that they mitht be managed so as to
stand the concussion of firing cannon. He cons>-
dere 1 there was no more appropriate provision in
the bill than this amendment, and he theiefore
hoped the motion to strike out would not prevail
Mr HUNTINGTON ox ires ed his satisfaction
that an opportunity uou'd i«n be a (fordid lo vote
on the amende c i t It 1. id ten «doptrd witht ut
the sanction of liV c inm"'ee, «ta 1 none ivh ch had

He hoped the vo J woul I be r c>ns dered, and
then tie am ndn.e it rejected H di 1 not ( p> o e

place hele
Mr. EVANS obj°c ed to t^e amendment on ac-
count of its ínitiquacy for the olj c designed.
Mr. W00DBR1D9E said he hid no  Clanged
his opinion ot ttu importance ot ihe appropriation,
but his ftars were that tr>e bill, overl aded with
amendment, would IVi . He undeisood from
those who had i n their power to carry through
the bill, that wi h this Atnendm nt i' would uik
He, theiefore, had no chuce, but tip tss 1 is mo-
tion, or run the risk of losing with the who e bul
the amtndment of s„ch vital interest to hi, eons 1-
tueuts
Mr. WRIGHT said be would detail the Senate
but a moment Tnere seemed to be a strange mis-
undtrs anmng about the amendm-nt mide by the
Strator from Ono It ivas no* to spend one nun-
died thousand dUlar* unc"ndi!i sally It H.isto
plaee so rnrn.ii at the disposal of the President of
ihe United S ates, m c^se a ctr am com ngency
should take p -ce He coull n t «ee how the pro-
priety of the appropriation could for a moment be
doubted. Trie British had access on L ke Onta-
rio, on the Niagara river and other communicatm 
waters which they could by means of the Welland
canal bring into Lake Erie widiina few days. But
the United States.had no  such advantage, and ]
should therefore  trust to   the armament of  her
merchant vessels already on Lake Erie
Mr. WOODBURY said the word "armament"
had been introduced into the amendment, probAtly
in consequence of hi  cuggeition to the mover Mr.
W. then believed, and still does, that it would be
exceedingly useful, merely to procure cannon of
suitable calibre, cannon ball, gunpowder, &c for
use in our commercial steamboats. If this was
don?, and these munitions collected at important
depot*, such as Burlington, Oswego, Buffalo, Erie,
Cleveland, Detroit, and Chicago, they could, in a
few days' warning, and in any expee'ed incursion,
be placed on board the exis'mg boats used for pas
sengers and freight There they could be used
most efficiently m various ways, and at numerous
points, A single new war steamer, large or small,
need not be erected on the Northern lakes under
this appropriation, and no violation whatever be
made of the convention with England
This armament so employed was to be our chief
re'iance in sudden emergencies on th^ sea shore as
well as lakes It was for this reason chiefly, that,
on a former occasion, he had urged some new ex-
penditures to fortify the month of the Pfcataqua
river, near Portsmouth—because few commerc al
steamboats existed there, while at New York, New
Orleans, &c they abounded—and could, as float-
ing batteries, be speedily equipped, and rendered
very efficient in beating off, as well as in annoy-
ing an invading enemy.
Portificatio is were, on that account, much less
needed at these last de^cuption of place-* than at
Portsmouth. It wa- lamentable that such an ex-
posed point as Portsmouth, with so much public
properly at her important naval depot, and such
valuable private manufacturing e<tnb ishmmts
near, should be neglected in this c.m . But thit
would not prevent hioi from supporting this amsnd-
ment for other places, which in a certain con-
tingency, would, in h s view, be very useful and
efficient, if the money was employed m procuring
suitable armamtnls, to b° used when necessary in
our commercial steamboats on the lakes.
The question was then taken on the motion to
reconsider, and decided in the negative, as follows:
YEAS—-Messrs. Archer, Barrow, Bates, Bayard,
Berrien, Choate, Clay of Kentucky, Clayton,
Dixon, Evans, Graham, Huntington, Ker, Man-
gum, Merrick, Miller, Morehead, Porter, Preston,
Rives, Smuhof Indiana, and Southard—22.
NAYS—Messrs Al en, Benton, Buchanan, Clay

Mouton, Nicholson, Pierce, Sevitr, Smith of Con-
necticut, Sturgeon, Tallmadge, Tappan, Walker,
White, Willliams, Woodbridge, W< odbury,Wngb',
and Young—23
Messrs WOODBURY, WRIGHT, and AL-
LSN briefly opposed the reconsideration, and Mr
WOODBRIDGE slated the reason which had in-
duced him to mike the motion, not being opposed
to theimendmert, but preferring that it be lost, to
the loss of the whole bill.
The mo i n for reconsideration was rejected—
