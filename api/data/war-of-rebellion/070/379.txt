HEADQUARTERS,Harper's Ferry, may 4, 1864.

Colonel R. S. RODGERS,

Commanding at Martinsburg:

About 100 armed dismounted men are on their way by railroad to re-enforce you. You need not allow the current rumors about the enemy to disturb you, for General Sigel must be aware of the entire situation, and they are probably only stragglers who are doing the mischief of which you speak, not any real force.

By order of Brigadier General Max Weber:

SAML. F. WOODS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

WINCHESTER, VA., May 4, 1864.

POST HEADQUARTERS,

Charleston, W. Va., May 4, 1864.

Major JOHN S. WITCHER,

Commanding Detachment Third West Virginia Cavalry:

MAJOR: Your report of engagement on the 3rd instant was received this morning. Captain James L. Botsford, assistant adjutant-general, has gone south with the general. All mounted and armed men have left here with the general, therefore it will be impossible to send you any re-enforcements. Keep your men well in hand; do not allow any of them to straggle away from camp. Keep a sharp lookout against surprise, and do not let your men run into ambush.

Yours, respectfully,

R. YOUART,

Major, Commanding Post.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, May 4, 1864-2.40 p. m.

(Received 4.45 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Your dispatch of yesterday disposes of twenty regiments. There are seventeen regiments more. What disposition shall be made of them? We are likely to be delayed some time for want of blankets for the men. Only about 10,000 in the State.

JOHN BROUGH,

Governor.
