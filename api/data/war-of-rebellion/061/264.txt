No. 8. Report of Brigadier General Thomas E. G. Ransom, U. S. Army, commanding detachment of the Thirteenth Army Corps, of operations April 6-8.

NEW YORK CITY, June 11, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the movements of the troops under my command, consisting of the Third Division, Thirteenth Army Corps, Brigadier General R. A. Cameron commanding, and the Fourth Division, Thirteenth Army Corps, Colonel W. J. Landram commanding, on the 6th, 7th, and 8th of April, 1864:

On the 6th of April my detachment, having the advance of the infantry column, moved from Natchitoches at 6 a.m., in rear of the Cavalry Division, and being constantly delayed by the baggage train of the latter, went into camp late on Bayou Mayon, having marched 16 miles on the Pleasant Hill road. Moved at 5.30 a.m. on the 7th, the head of the column arriving at Pleasant Hill, 19 miles, at 2 p.m., overtaking the cavalry train on the road and Dudley's brigade of cavalry at Pleasant Hill. When these had moved from our camping-ground I went into camp about 4 p.m., though my train and rear guard did not arrive until late at night. At 10 p.m. of the 7th, I received an order, of which the following is a copy:
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES WESTERN LOUISIANA,April 7, 1864.

Brigadier General T. E. G. RANSOM,

Commanding Detachment Thirteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs that a brigade of infantry be sent to General Lee, to be with him by daylight to-morrow morning. You may use your discretion as to sending a brigade or division. The spirit of the order will doubtless be carried out by sending a division. Send, therefore, a brigade or division to report to General Lee at or before 5 a.m. on to-morrow (Friday), 8th instant.

Respectfully,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General.
