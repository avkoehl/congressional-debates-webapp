HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Front Royal, Va., June 3, 1862.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: It is the order of Major-General McDowell that you send your cavalry force to Strasburg via Middletown, and conduct away from there the prisoners of war, bringing them to this place. Of course they cannot return before to-morrow.

The general directs me to remind you that General Duryea's brigade has charge of the town of Front Royal, the police of the same, the guarding of prisoners, &amp; c., and that therefore it is not possible, even if it were desirable, to employ the whole brigade in guarding the railroad. The regiment now employed in the city is therefore not to be assigned to the guarding of the railroad.

Very respectfully,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Front Royal, Va., June 3, 1862.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: There is apprehension that a bridge which has been carried away near Strasburg may float down, and lodging against the wagon bridge over the North Fork may carry away its supports. On the South Fork there is a bridge moving, and the general commanding directs that you be informed of the same, that you may make the necessary preparations to avoid the destruction of the bridges which are threatened.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE RAPPAHANNOCK,Front Royal, Va., June 3, 1862.

Major General E. O. C. ORD,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: It is the direction of Major-General McDowell that you take adequate measures to be prepared to throw across the river provisions for Colonel Christian's regiment, which you report to be cut off by the bridge across the North Fork of the Shenandoah being carried away.

To avoid the chances of Generals Hartsuff's and Ricketts' brigades being in the same straits, the general suggests that you withdraw them on this side of the bridge while it yet stands, if in your judgment it can be done with safety.

Supplies have been had since this morning, and if your brigade commissaries will apply direct to the chief commissary of the department it will facilitate their procurement much.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. SCHRIVER,

Colonel and Chief of Staff.
