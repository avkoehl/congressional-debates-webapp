HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION,November 21, 1864.

CAPTAIN: Seven deserters from the Seventh New Jersey Regiment and two from the Eighth New York [Heavy Artillery] Regiment came into our line this morning. James Stewart (one of the deserters), of the Eighth New York Regiment, Second Brigade, Second Division, Second Corps, stated that the enemy were mining in front of Colquitt's salient; that they used a car which ran upon tracks to bring the earth out. He stated that the car could be heard running down grade some time after it started from the entrance to the mine. I would respectfully request that an officer acquainted with mining operations be sent to Colquitt's salient to investigate the matter and determine what countermining is necessary upon our part. I would also request that he confer with me upon the subject. Stewart also reported that the Second Division of the Second Corps rested upon the Appomattox and extended to the left until it united with the Third Division, Second Corps. The Ninth Corps is on the left of the Third Division of the Second Corps, and the First Division of the Second Corps is in reserve to the Second Division of the same corps in front of Colquitt's salient, where the enemy are mining. The disposition of the enemy's forces shows a large reserve force where we have none. As the repairing of the roads are under charge of Colonel Talcott, I would respectfully suggest that he be directed to examine the road across Lieutenant Creek, at the end of Sycamore street, as it is impossible to haul wood on that road, and I think it will be necessary to construct a new one.

The following casualties are respectfully reported: Gracie's brigade, wounded, 1.

Respectfully, &c.,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.

Captain S. D. SHANNON, Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
