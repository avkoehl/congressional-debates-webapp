THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 24,
$2,000, when the same duties, and really twice as
much, are performed by like officers in many of
the States for a much less amount. Whwe the
offices are eagerly sought after with that remu-
neration, and the duties thereof discharged with
as much ability and fidelity, may we not then as-
sume that the- same correction would be made and
the same results follow from the action of the peo-
ple if they had the power in a Territory as in a
new State? When they have the control, and are
responsible for their action, they will only incur
such expenditures as they can reasonably meet
and which will be found abundant to carry on
their government.
If your constituents ask you, gentlemen, why
this difference ? answer them truly, and tell them
that in one case the people arrange and judge of
those matters for themselves with a just, regard
for the duties to be performed and a reasonable
compensation therefor; while in the other, the
places are to be filled by the'appointees of the
party in power, with a view to mold the politi-
cal character of the new State, and for the further
purpose of rewarding political partisans who have
been repudiated by the people at the ballot-box;
but having done some service for the party they
are taken from the political battle-field from among
the dead and dying, by the President, to the great
political hospital, the appointing power, and soon
find themselves provided for in some well-paid
office in a Territory. And, sir, so disastrous have
been the political conflicts of late to the Admin-
istration, that many new Territories are to be
organized to supply the pressing wants of the
Executive.
Mr. Chairman, I am opposed to the doctrine
and principle of dependencies; and would divest
our territorial system of it as much as possible.
In Great Britain it serves the purpose of providing
for the wants of that portion of the nobility who
cannot provide for thems|lves; in our country it
is made a sure retreat for the disappointed po-
litical aspirant, or it serves to propitiate some
vigorous party leader by the appointment of his
retainers. Relieve the people of this policy, give
them the choice of their own officers, make these
officers accountable to the people who elect them,
require the people to assume the responsibility of
their own government; and yon will assimilate'
the territorial government to our popular State
institutions, and induce in the Territories a vig-
orousand manly growth. Sir, pursuing this pol-
icy, 1 would be just to the people of the States as
well as the Territories, and require that the latter
should remain under a territorial form of govern-
ment until the character of their institutions
should be indicated, and until their population
should be equal to the number required for one
member in Congress under the ratio of congres-
sional representation; so that, when admitted as a
State, their political power in the councils of the
nation would not be greater than the same num-
ber of people ill the States.
This policy was clearly indicated 111 the early
days of the Republic, so early as the organiza-
tion of the different Territories in the Northwest,
then so called. Even when the ratio was thirty
thousand, and afterwards thiity-three thousand,
there was a provision in the ever-memorable ter-
ritorial ordinance of 1787, which was applied from
time to time to successive new Territories, as fol-
lows:
<■ Ami whenever any of the s.nd Suites shiiil have sivty
liieusancl tree inhabitants therein, f-uc!i State shall bt: ad-
mitted, li.v its D( legates, into the Congress of lliu United
Htate>. on ;m einuf toounir with the oimmal States Pro-
i idcd, The constitution and sioveriimfntso to be formed shall
lie republican and in conlorniny to tile pmiciplos eontamed
in tho-e article.-,; and -o far it can be consistent with the
general int''ie.--ts of the Confedeiaey, ruei: adnit^ion shall
tie allowed at an eaiber penod. and when there mav be
a Irs-- rummer of inhabitants 111 ibe State than sixty thou-
sand.
Thus clearly indicating the opinion? and policy
of the men of that age, yet providing for an ex-
ception to the general rule, if any contingency
should arise that might seem to require it.
The reason for naming that number doubtless
was the belief that, in the then ordinary course
of emigration and settlement of a new country,
sufficient time would elapse befoie that number
would be reached to give permanency to the set-
tlements, and, at the same time, a clear right to
the people to congressional representation by the
i..niiber of inhabitants. And this policy does not
seem to have been departed from but in a very
few instances, as will appear from the following
statement, believed to be correct:
Population of the several States, the ratio of representation,
and the number of Representatives allowed to each at the
time of their admission respectively.

And in the instances that seem to have been ex-
ceptions to the general rule, which are but three,
(Illinois, Arkansas, and Florida,) Arkansas had
largely over the number then required for one
member in Congress. Illinois, at the time of her
admission, lacked three hundred and eighty only
of the ratio of representation then established; and
Florida numbered fifty-four thousand four hun-
dred and seventy-seven inhabitants when admit-
ted; yet the congressional ratio was then seventy
thousand six hundred and eighty. Thus^n one
instance only has there been really a substantial
departure from the rule requiring a sufficient num-
ber of inhabitants for one Representative. The
reason for this exception might have been as
marked then for Florida, as it now is believed to
be for Kansas; all of winch reasons for excep-
tional cases would be avoided by the proposed
change of policy. And I may here assume, that
at the present time, one hundred thousand will
become permanent inhabitants of a Territory, as
soon as 'would sixty thousand at the time that
number was adopted as the rule. It is certain that
equality of representation and political power can
alone be securcd but by adhering to the general
rule; and it should not be departed from only
where the reasons for such departure are clear and
manifest.
Mr. Chairman, I have but little expectation that
these propositions will meet with favor from those
in power; but, sir, they will commend themselves
to'the common sense and honest judgment of the
people; and whether they are adopted by this
House now, or not,,the time is not far distant when
our constituents will require their enactment.
THE POSITION AND TENDENCY OF PARTIES.
Mr. ATKINS. Mr. Chairman, it may not be
altogether unprofitable at this particular juncture
to review briefly some of the leading events of the
histoiy of parties, and to analyze some of their
peculiar characteristics. The time seems auspi-
cious.
The American statesman who would progress
safely in the science of political government, is
pot unlike the mariner who explores an unknown
sea. Even 111 the midst of the most placid waters,
under the most auspicious sky, and with the
most prosperous gales, he should cast anchor and
take his reckoning of both wind and current.-
Whither are we tending ? is a question often
propounded in political circles. It is generally
asked by politicians whose little barks have been
shipwrecked upon the shoal of expediency; for
the man who pursues principle, although he may
for a timesink beneath the wave of popular sen-
timent, will surely rise again. Right principles
never lead to wrong results. I have no solicitude
whatever to know whither we are tending, so far
as the great national party, with which I stand
identified, is concerned. Its past history is to my
mind a sufficient guarantee of what its future will
be. But whither are the Opposition parties tend-
ing, for there are several factions of them ?
The history of American politics presents two
distinguishing and leading facts. One is, that there
have never been but two political parties in this
country formidably contending for the mastery at
the same time. The other is, that the Democratic
party has always been one of these, while the Op-
position party has changed its name and princi-
ples to suit the temper of the times. The one is
a party of expediency, while the other is a party
of principle; the one advocates the interests ofthe
few at the expense of the many; the other advo-
cates the greatest good to the greatest number; the
one sustains the interests of favored classes, the
other sustains the interests ancLrights of the peo-
ple. The one is founded in high Federal aristoc-
racy; the other is the offspring of Democracy; the
one is styled the " people's party," while the other
is the party of the people. The grounds of dif-
ference between these two parties were plainly
defined by the respective administrations of the
elder Adams and Thomas Jefferson; a difference
so broad and deep that itstruck to the verybasis
of government itself. It is refreshing in these days
of political degeneracy to return to the original
fountains of political lore, like pilgrims to the Holy
Land. Our views of Federalism and Democracy
become more vivid and distinct the nearer we ap-
proach the primitive days of the Republic.
The Adams or Federal party favored a strong
consolidated and central Government; a Govern-
ment or nation of people, viewing the States in the
light of dependencies or provinces; while the Jef-
fersonian or Democratic party regarded the cen-
tral Government as a Union of free, sovereign,
and independent States, as a limited derivative
sovereignty, as a commissioned agent, with no
powers only those expressly delegated and nom-
inated in the Federal Constitution. The one ad-
hered to a strict construction of that instrument,
the work of great, good, and patriotic men; the
other would construe it latitudmously—finding a
grant of power to ingraft upon the policy of the
country almost any measure which expediency
might suggest, or ambition demand, although in
clear violation of its letter and spirit, and often of
doubtful utility.
Of these I might mention various instances,
long since exploded, and against which the fiat
of the American people has been unmistakably
pronounced. The shades even of a United States
•Bank and distribution, and their kindred brood
of political heresies, do not now enter within the
walls of this Capitol. But I will forbear to ex-
hume these buried memories over which the man-
tle of oblivion has been long since thrown by the
hand of the nation, further than they may serve
to illustrate the argument I am about to submit.
As a R-epresentative of a southern constituency,
with a heart whose every pulsa-lion beats jeal-
ously for the honor of my beloved section, in the
Union, or out of it, should I live to see that evil
hour, there is one truth of which I am most earn-
estly convicted, and that is, that the South " owes
the "Iliad of all her woes" to this hbertinous-lat-
itudinous construction of the Constitution. And
I declare here to-day, if ihis Union is ever dis-
solved— if that " bright particular star" shall dis-
appear from its central position, and go darkling
through chaos, no more to light the nations of
the earth in their march to civilization and con-
stitutional liberty, the historian must date its de-
cline to this unfortunate and fatal principle.
Mr. Chairman, it is my purpose to show that
the Democratic party has administered this Gov-
ernment successfully and prosperously, and in
strict accordance with the Constitution. And
that the inequality that lm?, from time to time,
crept into the Federal legislation of the country,
has been effected by the Opposition party during
the occasional intervals when it was in power,
and when the Democracy failed to have a work-
ing majority—that inequality being always un-
