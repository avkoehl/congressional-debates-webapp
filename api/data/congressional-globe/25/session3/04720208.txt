Interference in Elections—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
What was my opinion in 1828, when I was
in the Opposition, is still my opinion in 1839,
when I am in the majority I say now, that the
Admimstiation which goes abroad with its pati on-
asetomalteconveitsof its enemies, at the expense
of its friends, acts both with ingiatitude and m
justice Such an Administration deserves to be
p-ostrated Although neither from punciple nor
fiom feeling am I a root and, branch man, yet, in
this rtspect, I adopt the opinion of General
Washington, the first, the greatest, the wisest,
and the best of our Presidents I ptefer him
eithci to General Jackson or to the great Apostle
of Ameiican hbeity This opinion, however,
may proceed fiom the relics of old redciahsm
On this subject General Washington says
" I shall BQt, whilst I have tho honor to administer th c
Government, bring a nnn into any othce of consequence,
knowjngiy, whose political tenets are adverse to the meas
urts wlneh the General Government is pursuing , for Uní,
m -my opinion, would he a egrt of RQlttieal suicide That it
would £i h.ariass us movements is certain "
Now, sir, if any freak of destiny should ever
placedme in one of these Executive Departments,
and 1 feel very certain that it never will, 1 shall
toll you the course I would pursue     I should not
become an mquisitoi of the political opinions ol
the suboidmate office holdeis, who aie icctiving
satanes of some eight bundled 01 a thousand dol
lars a year   For the higher and more icsponsiblt
officts, howevei, 1 would selectable, faithful, uml
well tued political fnends, who felt a deep and
devoted mteiostin the success of my measuits
A.nd this not for the purpose of concealment, foi
no public officii pught to be afiaid of the scru-
tiny of the woild, but that they might chteifully
cooperate with me in promoting what I bi litvttt
to be tho public inteitst     I would have no pel-
son aiound me, either to hold hick in tho tjaces,
01 to thwart and tUfeitmy purposes   With Gen
eial Washington, 1 behe\e that any othet couisc
" would be a sou of political suiciih  "
In executing the duties of a public office, I
should act upon the same prmcipli s that would
govern my conduct in repaid to a private trust
If the Senatoi (torn Vnginia weie to consuiuu
me his attorney, to transact any impon mt busi
nees, I should novel < mploy assistants whom I
selievctl to be openly and avowedly hostil to bib
mtorists
But, snvs the Senatoi, you alitmly luuo yom
Preiorian bands in this <uy lit tloiibtlcsj il

Pittorim binds aie, to a gieat t xtent, on iht
side of the ¡auiatoi liom Kentucky and his po
luteal filends J would now do them gnat in
pjstiet if I were to call tlitm the enlisted soldiois
of the Adininistrition Whilst Gent ral Tacltson
was hei< they did keep toleiably quiet, but now
I tindtistand that many ol these hetuls of Inueaus
and cleiks use the freedom of speech and of tin
press without roseivc ngainst the niensuns ot his
successor Ofcouise, I spcalt fiom common re
poit God forbid that I should become an in
quisitoi as to any man's politics It is gonciaily
undei stood that about one half of thorn are open
enemies of the piesent Adminislration I have
some acquaintance with a few of those who aio
called us friends, and among this few I knou
several who, although they declaie they aie in
favor of the reelection of ¡Mr Vm Burin, yet
they-are decidedly opposed to all his piomintnt
measures Sunounded by such Pittoilan bands,
what has this tyrant done > Nothing—liteially
■nothing I believe he is the veiylast man in the
country who can justly be chaiged with using
his official patronage to control the iiecdom of
elections His foibearance towaius his political
enemies ra Office will unquestionably injure him
to some extent, and especially in those States
where, under the common paity law, no peison
diearns of being permitted to hold office fiom his
political enemies His liberality in this íespect
has been condemned by many of his friends,
whilst he is accused by his enemies of usin  his
official pationage for coriupt political piupose¡>
This is a hard fate The Senator must, there
fore, pardon me, after having his own high au-
thonty in favor of General Jackson's adminis-
tration, if, under that of his successor, I cannot
now see the dangers of Executive patronage m a
formidable light
There was one charge made by the Senator
from Virginia against the present Administration
which I should have been the fhstman to sustain,
had I believed it to be well founded Had the
Piesident evinced a determination, in the face of
all his punciples and professions, to form a pei-
manent connection, m violation of law, between
the Government and the Bink of the United
States, or any otherState bank, he should, in this
paiticulai, have encounteied my unqualified op-
position In such an event, I snould have been
willing to serve under the command of the Sena
tor against the Administration, and hundicds and
thousands of the unbought and incoiruptible De
mocracy would have rallied to oui standard I
am convinced, however, fiom the ropoits of tho
Secictanesof theTreasuiy and of Wai, andfrom
the other lights which have been shed upon the
subject, that " their poveity, and not then will,
consented" to the paitial and limited connection
which ltsulted from the sale of the bond to the
Bank of the United States Such seems to have
been the gtneial opinion on this Hoot, b eausc no
Senatoi cimc to tin aid of the g< ntlom m fiom
Viigtm i in sustaining this chuigt " Wlitie was
Roddick then5" Why did not the Senatorfiom
Kentucky come to the rescue, and sustain his
fuend fiom Vnginii in the accusation ahiinst the
Admimstiation of having again connected itt,eli
with the Bank of the Unitid ¡states'
The Senatoi from Vnginia his ínfoimed us
that in his Sute a luv exists prohibiting any man
who holds office under the Pedoia! Govtinmint

tcnstvi infltunceovei the people of theStatt-, I
am a btutc ughts man, and am thcrcfoieopj osed
to any connet Hon between this Govtinment and
the State banks and last of all to such a conntc
tion with the Bank of the United States, which
is the most powei ful of them all This is one
of the chief íeasons why I am in fivor of an in
di pendent Fieasury And yet, fnendly tobtate
rights us the Senator professts to bt, he com
plains of the Piesident for opposing such a con-
nection with the State banks, and theieby volun-
tauly depuvmg himself of the powcrand influence
which must ever íesult from such a union
There are other reasons why I am fuendly to
an independent Tieasury, but this is not the
proper occasion to discuss them I shall meiely
advert to one winch, in my opinion, renders an
immediate separation fiom the banks indispens-
able to the public inteiest The importation of
foreign goods into New York since the commence
ment of the piesen' year, \eiy far exceeds accoid-
lng to our information, the conesponding im-
portations duung the year 1836, although they
were greatei in that yeai than thev had evei been
since the ougm of our Government This must
at once create a large debt against us in England
Meanwhile, what is oui condition at horn  ! New
York has established what is called a free bank-
ing law, under whose piovisions more than fi^tv
banks had been established in the beginning of
Januaiy last, and 1 know not how many since,
with peimission to incicase their capital to
|487,O00,00O These banks do not even profess
to proceed upon the ancient, safe, and well estab-
lished principle of making the specie in their
vaults be?r some just and leasonable piopoiuon
to their cuculation and deposits Anothei and a
novel print pie is adopted State loans and mo t
gages upon real estate are made to take the place
of gold and silver, and an amount of bank notes
may be issued equal to the amount of tin se stcu
rities deposited with the Compti oiler Theie is
no lestnction whatevei imposed on these banks
in regard to specie, except that they aie required
to hold eleven pence in the dollar, not of then
circulation and deposits united, but of then cir-
culation alone Well may that able officei have
declaied, in his report to the Legishture, that
" it is now evident that the point of danger is not
an exclusive metallic cunency, but an exclusive
piper cuirency, so lcdundant and umveisal as to
excite appithensions foi it3 stability " The
amount of papei issues of these banks, and the
amount of bank credits, must rapidly expand the
paper cuculation, and ugain produce extiavagant
speculation
'I he ex imple of New Yoik will have apowei-
ful mil lence on the  othti States of the Union
Aheady his Geoigia established a fiee banking
law, and a bill foi the same purpose is now be
foie the Logislatuie of Pennsylvania    If tht signs
of the times do not deceive me, we shall have an
othti explosion sooner, much soonei than I had
mtitipattd     Tht  Senator fiom Massachusetts
[VIi   WebstuiI nods his assent
Mi   WEBSTER.     I think so also
Mr BUCHANAN    This paper bubble must,
fiom its nature, go on rapidly expanding, until it
it \thcs the buisting point     The iccent suspen
siou  of spet ic paymt nts by the branch bank of
Mobih, m tht btatt of my fntnd fiom Alabama,
I [Mi King,] may bt thciemott and distant thun-
dti prtmomtoi y of tht appio telling storm Ihis
is all fottign, howtiti, to tht subj tt befoio the
Smite     Id sue now to dec! ue silemnly in ad-
' v m t, that if this explosion should conn , and the
moiK y of the pt oplt in theTrtnsuiy should again
j be converted into niedttmablt b ink piper and
b ink tredits, the Admimstiation will be guiltless
of tho dttd    We hive tutd, but tried in vain, to
I establish an Indt pendent Tieasury wheie this
money would bt sife, in the custody of officeis
its lonsiblt to the people
There is one incidtnt in relation to the Bank of
the United States which my friend fiom Vnginia
may bo cuuous to know Under the Ptnnsylva
iiu (luutei it was prohibited fiom issuing notes
undei ten dolíais I had fondly hoped that this
example might be giadually followed by our Le-
gislatuit in rtgaid to the other banks, until the
time should airue when our whole cuculation
un Itr ti n dolíais should consist of gold and sil-
vci Tho fite banking law of New York has
enabled the bank to nullify this restnction Un
di i this law it has established a bank in the city
of New Yoik, the capital of which may be m-
ci cased to $50,000,000, and has transferred to the
Comptiollei of that State Michigan State loan to
the amount of $200,000 And what notes, Mr
Piesident, do you suppose it has taken in lieu of
this amount of loan ? Not an assortment of differ-
ent denominations, as the othei banks have done,
but forty thousand five dollar notes These five
dollai notes will be paid out and circulated by
the bank at Philadelphia, and thus the wise ten-
aollar restriction contained in its Pennsylvania
chartci is completely annulled
If, therefore, I could believe for a moment that
this Government intended to form a permanent
connection with the Bank of the United States,
and again make it the general depository and fis-
cal agent of the Treasuiy, even if no other prin-
ciple weie invohtd than that of the enoimous
increase of Executive patronage which must neces
sarily follow, I should at once stand with my
friend fiom Virginia in opposition to the Admin-
istration But I would not go over with him to
the enemy's camp.   I have somewhere read u
