Making public officers depositaries—Mr. Mies.
Senate.'
Ü ei b were eigh y mac State banks, with a capital of 62,601 6"!
iO i ra,anda circulation of28,000 000 dollars In 18 6, when
tne Ute Bank of the United States was incorporated, there were
two hundred and iorty six banks, with a capital of 89,822,422
dollars, and a circulation ofS8,00O,00O dollars, and on the 1st of
ianuaiy 1636, two rot nth  before the charter of that bank ex
pired theie tr-t live hundred and fifty seven banks in the
United Stat   with a capital of 251,875,292 dot ars and a circu
Uuoa of 140,015 000 dollars Suchhaab'eti the restraining jn
flueace of a National Bank upon the giowth of State bank 
But how has u been in Eog'anJ where there is a National
Bank of vastly mote capital and power? In 1826, Parliament
au home 1 the establishment of joint stock banks, and from that
time to December, l&fe, tlieie hid been enal isiitd but sixiv
fmr banks, during a period of nearly ten year but from he
first of December lajj to the last of November 1830, only abo it
efeven month  forty two j< int stock banks wore ota jhshed
with an average of nom four to six branches each, making, in
reality, two hundred banks in eleven months What! re
stiainmg influence the Bank of Lndand m« hare had1 This
was the period during which the fink of hnglanu was rapidly
expanding its circulation, which vías the principal cause of the
increase of the joint stock banks by stiuulatirg and credt ng e
factitious demand for hank facilities and bv addirip «o greatly to
the profits of bankin  The «ame has been tie case hete
When the Bank o f the United States, na  expanded the (ui rency,
andgivea great activity and great piofits to bankn g operation
then the State banks have sprung up like m ishroums all ovti
the countiy Tim was the casedurmg the > Lar  I&3:> and 183b,
and at some former periods So totally inconsistent with lacu
is the pietension that the refusal to rechaiter the Cmted states
Bank is the cause of the increase of State banks
As to the other assumption of the povt er of a ¡National Bank,
to restrain and regula'e the "5tate banks, I have, in another pan
of myremaiks consider d that point It is as unfounded as
the other, It is a delusion, which has been given up in England,
and must he here, or the evils of our «retched paper svstem
will go on increasing until n results m a ten ibie catastrophe,
similai to that which overv, helmed France, by the 'welliegu
la ed'  credit system of John I aw
A single word, sir, as to the íemovalofthe revenue* <roin

as they received the public revenues! These questions must
be answered m the affirmative Andis there any icason to be

stimulating an expansion was to have wiu día n d m fro n
all banks both totate and INanonnl
Sif, the deposite act of ltsJSb has been íesrarded asone of the
causes of the derangement o he cunency This owcvei

but whatever its influence may hove b po it wasnotfnAdn
nistrattou mea ure it was a measure of th  Oppo^it on, pio
posed and voted for by eveij Opposition membei of Cor  t s
The Treasury ordei has also been ehareel as on  ot the
causes which has contributed to the disoiders m our monc'aiv
aífeiri So much has been sail on thv, I „ul not dwell u, on
it Its mflaerce must have hecitempoiaiv and hmied If i
diew two or three millions of specie fiom the Ens cm States to
the Western, it nptara'ly and necessarily forced its wav bacv
in the regu'ar course of trade Specie, like watei, wi 1 find i =>
ev#i,and go wheioitis wanted If the Government biln-s-pe
cte intoour seaports, as in the case of the Prench indemnity it
is alleged as «cause of derangma; the currency, and )t it col
lects its dues m specie and diaws it from those points, as is said
to have been done by the Tieasuiy older, that is a cau eofái 
turbance to the currency But the Bank of the United state 
can import or expoi t specie, or purchase specie at the Wes' to
the amount of tons, and it has, no disturbing influence on oin
monetary affairs It is only the tiansactiorla of Ine Government
that derange the currency
I have now, sir, exaromtd the alleged causes of the derange
went of the paper cunency, and proceed to submit a few re
ma ks on what I consider the true causes The mam ran=e is
«ur wretched banking and paper credit system, the nregular
action of which, us expansionsand contractions, are as much a
part of the system, and as inseparable from 11, as are the ebb
and flood tides a part of the laws which act upon the ocean
Where thft currency of a country has no other foundation than
credit, and at the same time is mscpaiably counected with pn
vate credit and both expand and contract togethei, to seek for
causes independent of the system itself, would be not only as
atiphilosophica], but show as little common sense, as to attempt
to explain the particular motions of a piece of machinery with
out reference to the construction and principles of it
Currency whether metallic or papei, is eovei ned by general
and fixed laws A metallic currency has its principles, and is
regulated by the great and universal law of demand and supply
Pjpor money, resting on the credit of the State has its laws, and
a currency supplied by banks has us primary law which con
trols it, and that is the action of thf banks or the working of
the machine which supplies it, which throws it into circula
tion, and withdraws it from circulation When this machine
worke irregularly, as is the case with our banking system, the
currency mustbesubjectto corresponding irregularities    But

""BtH^believing that this Government has no power over the
State banks, I believe that it has no power to regulate, m any
effectual mar ner, the paper currency, and, in my opinion, no-
thing can haVe a more pernicious efiect, or be more directly
calculated to prolonsrthe existing disorders, than togivetothe
public mirdafaHe direction, and to keep up the unfortunate
delusion winch prevails, that this Government can, andougbt

Sir, it is a delusion—a fatal delusion, the evil has not ongi
nated from our legislation, and it cannot be corrected here,
W e have not the power to do i, and if we had, i very much
doub whethei Vve couli exercise it. Iftepht into twenty six
parts, the banks are too strong for the States, united, they would
he too strontr for Congress It is o ir first and highest duty to
leave this subject where the Constitution has left it—with the
States and the people, and the or'y thm* we can do is to sepa
rate this Government from the banking svsiem, thai our con
nee ion with it may not be an obstacle to a reformation by
those whoalone have the right and the power The bill before

one stroni? recommendation of It
