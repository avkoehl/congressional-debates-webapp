CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
vmhsdi the public works, to s op which, and to hold some per-
son responsible, means should be adopted With a knowledge
«f these oircumstancts, the Committee of Ways and Means did
not feel wilting to give $ 150,000 but had reduced the appropna*
tion to €6Ü,O0J with the proviso.
Mr PARMENrüR did not believe the transaction to be one
which required censuie He asked, if a proper site could be
ejected without, a large expenditure, equal„or nearly equal to
this? And the pitiarsweieonly of such a chaiacter as those
that were used in the public buddings of a city like Boston—the
re't of theedrfhe beio^ substantial work, the Secretaiy of
the Treasury ne (Mr P.) knew was very reluctant that any in-
crease should be make in the expendituie for this woik, but lie
knew that it was toully impossible to bui'd a custom house m
a city like Boston without such an expenditure But after all,
the matter had to come before Congress; and with Congress,
then, the responsibility rested
But blame was due *o no one. He was acquainted with the
location, and he Was satisfied that a better could not be had, nor
any as good without costing as much
Mr, WHITE of Indiana denied that there had been authority
Originally given to erect, tins custom house on so extensive a
«scale, and he believed the transaction to be a censurable one
Mr WlNTHROPre-iUtd
Mr CAVE JOHNSOV said he was a member of the Con
gress of Ib35, when the appropriation of $50,000 was made,
which was only made on the condition or with the restriction
to which gentlemen had advei ted If it had been known to that
Congress that t^e custom house would cost half a million, or a
million of dollars, the appropriation never would have
been nade In Una way, then, in 1835 Congtess was induced
to make an entering wedge, the appropriation was made but no
thing wjs done until they had got n<-ar 8300,000, and then they
commenced laj mg out ¡he work, and Congress had continued
its appropriations to the present period and he supposed must
go on and fif ish the work Now there ha i been an imposition
of the grossest kind and getulemensought to throw the blame
on Mr Wo ¡dbury and Mr Van Binen, but what had they to
do with it? Mr Woodbury hid nothing more todo with tthan
to send to Congress the estimates, and Mi Van Buien nothing
morethan giving his approval to the bill which Congress had
passed But he thought this custom house could still be made
useful to the nation and to Congress, withoutgomg on to spend
half a million oí dollars up in it 11 addition to what had been
epentalready He would leave jt standing as a monument of
exrravagaHce and folly, that futuie Congresses might learn a
lesson of wisdom frm i the acts of their p edecessors
Mr CUSIIING thought this was a simple matter of busi-
ness Congress had nearly completed the building and there
Bponsibiluy rested with them Should they leave it, then, to eo
to ruin, as the gent'emin from Tennessee suggested? Or shouid
they go on and complete the ed ficeí W ha ever limitation
t ere might have been m the fir*t ippiopriation that had been
negatived by the subsequ, nt appropriations, and he entreated
the House not to be lead by extianeouo considerations from
completing the work
Mr SaMSON MASON said that the change of the plan and
the erection sf the building of granite, instead of the material
originally con emplated, I ad occasioned the difference m the
©xpendituies He then discussed the question as to who was
entitled to censure, ami concluded that it was due to the Exe
cutive Departments to which the execution of the law was en-
trusted, and not to Congre&s, the tneie lawmaker
The debate was furthercontmued by Messrs HABERSHAM,
WINTHROP, and H li^TEAD
Mr GORDON rn-,e aim lloud cries of "question, question,"
and proceeded for a few moment* without being heaid by  the
Reporter, in the nosse and confusion that prevailed    He wnt

In this case bt/oretiu hit    ji   wis eonmer Led, it was krown

ofihecase, and hiving a^cert med that the appropriation was
not surlicieut, ieporU*d the same to Concrress.and an appeal waa
gade for a funberappropnation    But he would ask did the
«secretary of the Treasury authorize the work to goon without
me saneen of CongEsss   No   A report was made to Congress,
and the next year the appropriation was made Congress with
a full knowledge oftheijnadequacy of the appropriation made
an addmuonat one of 200 060 Now would it be pretended by
any one that Congress, when they made this appropriation,
were not aware that it was in addition to the iormer one of
S50 000, together with the proceeds of the old building?
Now, what right had the gentleman from Ohio to -cast
censure on Mr. Woodbury? Was he not a membei of
Congress at the time, and did he not vote for this
appropriation? Did he vote for it without a know-
ledge of the cucumst^nces and if he did how ceuld he
umify it to his constituents? The gentleman said that the
Committee of Ways and Means were not informed by the Sec-
retary oftheTieasury of the circumstances ofthecase How
did the gentleman know u? It the gentleman was not a mem-
ber of the committee at that time his political friends were and
he, Mr G undertook to say that the committee were fully
possessed by the Secretary of the Treasury all the mfoimauon
necessary If the eentl man winked at this fraud, with a
full knowledge of the circumstances, it was a specimen of
Ohio morality and Ohio legislation, that might God deliver him
from But he would ask, was not this work commenced on
the memorial of the aristocratic merchants of Boston, who,
since the davs of Blue Lights had been Federalists, and the op
ponenfs of the Democratic Administrations, and would gentle
men charge upon them this fraudulent commencement and pro
gressof the work? Not only were these memorialists in oppo
sition to the then Administration, but the architect al o was,
and so were theeommis-ioneis If there v*as any thing wrong,
m what did it consist? Gentlemen had charged upon the late
Administration fraud ard mismanagement, both in the com
mencement and piogte sof the work Now he blamed nobody,
he blamed the system under which publicbuildinge had hitherto
been coi «tr ¡cted, hy men was a very mischievous one, and
ought tobe cuirected Ono other point he would notue The
gen leman from Ohm, m endeavoring to rai^e political capital,
had made the chaige of extravagant appropriations during the
admniotrations of General Jackson and Mr Van Buren Now
by whom were these appropriation made? If gentlemen would
take the trouble to examine the yeas and nays on the journals of
the House, they would find that all the°e extravagant appro,
pnations had been earned by the votes of the Whig panv,
aided by a riiií 1 minority of the Democratic party, wt o vou d
forthemftrloctl considerations He challenged investigation
of thifclact, and he ventured to a^ert, fiom a knowledge of the
ffontlemanN, chuftcui that he voted for the whole of then.
The gentleman "after assisting in getting through these appro-
pnations, now made u*e of them before the House, as he and
his party did at the hustings beiore the people, to bung'odium
on the Demociatic party, a large majority of whom voted
against them
He had now a woul to say to the gentleman from Indiana,
[Mr White 1 whoseemed to be particularly opposed to this ap
propiiation oí 50 0QÜ out ef something like spite to the east,
the Atlantic«ea board Now hewouldask the gentleman from
Indiana if his State intended to give up 500,000 acres of land
which she sot under the distribution bití? Bid he mean that
his State should give up hei school lands and all the donaiions
that C )t gress hid made to hei7
He would now ¡uin bis at ention to another part of thesub
ject Th< Committee tf Ways and Means proposed to appro
pnate $50 000 to he expended under the duection of the Secre
taryof the Tre^uiy {to render the custom hou^e fit for the re-
cap ion of the collector and his officers, and providing that no
part of ihe money should be expended on the oi namental parts
of the building, roí t'is he thought the committee deserved
some credit riion°h if m ght be very desirable to the ansto
crane meichant«of Bo&ton to have a splendid marble palace,
yet hPthouer t at tins time, when the Treasury fiad beenle
duced toso low an ebb by the misconduct of the ruling party—
ata time when it wa^contemi latedeellmg the public bonds m
the market to the h shest bidder, that they ought to content
themselves with tnt, jseful and postpone the ornamental parts
of the building till better times The aristocratic cha
racter thit i ed been given to our public buihhncs
commenced when the paper bubble was at its greatest
expansion—when the banking system was triumphal t
thioush the country, and extravagant notions and
splendid pr ert=¡ consequently grew up Now that the pap«r

11 e LÜAIR [Mr \bnold] overruled the point of order
Mi GORDON continued and leplied to the remarks of Mr

been hrsl given to the debite by the eentlemen r f the Whig par

Mr1 SMITH of Virgmia then offered a substitute to thepro-
yiso, as foilowí
Provided That no portion of this appropriation, o? of the
unexpended balarce of a former ar piopnanon, shall beex-
pended except for putting on a loof and hargirg such doors

Mr bMH II of Virginia said the committee wou'd observe
that the objectof ihife amendment was to íeetnu the exfendi-

against the we.ther We have, said he had been tngaged in
very heavy expendituies on thts work, and he was willing
theiefore to see the appropnation, propped by thecirarmttee,
applied to the preservation of it from i> jury, and he would afck
the attention of the committee while he veiy buefly expían ed
thegioind* on wrich he placed his an endmtnt In the firbt
place be becged the Committee tuobceive that there was no
mimed ate use for the bui.ding as there was, at this time, a
safe ard convenient custom house in Boston, belonging to the
Government, m which the public business was tianeicted Gen*
tlamen would picas" bear tins in mind Now, when lie com-
mittee recotk cted th it the public service would i«ot suffer, and
that it v  ould be more economically conducted In the building m

his amendment should be adopted

Mr SMITH of Virginia saw no great inconvenience in this
