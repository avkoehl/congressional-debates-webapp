Postponement of fourth instalment—Mr, Renchcr.
H. of Reps.
dinger mth t -mpt Opinions differ amongst vourbtst and
ablest advi tie, wae her you c m n<*w make the position good,
And if yoi do not, theie iq no esc ^ no choice, but m uncon-
ditional sun cnder
One woui moie.sir, to the honor-1 ¡ie member from South
Carolina, and to those to whom this portion of his addiess is
directed I under 'and him as making an appeal to the Demo
ctata of the North, to rally aiound this Sub Treasuiy scheme,
as their surest and safest piotection against the opposition of
Northern capitalists He tells them that they are looked upon
as the natural allies of the- ^outh, because their labor holds the
game position to capital m their country, that out slaves hold
to then owners at the ¡south
How thf^s  N'orthern Dcmoeia •, may relish the doctrines of
their new ally, I need ventuie no piediction    1 doubt whether
they can be brought to tally around the standaul oi a leadei
who denies them any place, e^ en in the common scale of hu
manity
Isitupou principles such as these that the Nor hern Demo-
cracy i& invoked to lend then aid to the measuics contemplated
by this bill? The=?eaie they, I piesume, who are appealed to
in the occasional addresses of ccitam newspapeis, as the "de
moa acy of numbers," contiadistmguished, we find now¡ from
anydcmociacyof men—who hold no place in the thinking,
acting part of the community, but are classed as meiedead
weig'it, to be thrown at wdl i ito eithei scale of the political
balance
If there be any such party in our favoied land, I thank Hea
ven it is unknown m the quarter of the country fiom whence
I come. We hare there, sn, I am proud to say, as honest <uid
sturdy a race of Democr&is as ever the <nm shone upon Of
intelligent thinking, independent, and fiee men, e^ch doing and
¿cting for himself, m all questions ol public interest, having
perfect equality of nght, and par ícipatmg, to the fullest ex
teat of a iree citizen, in the direction and control of all public
affairs
This, sir, is the character of the Democracy with winch I
am familiar, noi, Iappiehend, are our tiueNohem Demo
^ratsof a texture any whit infenoi But 1 desire my consti-
tuents at least to know to what sort of Democracy the merits
of this bill are addressed by its friends Not to intelligent and
thinking men, but to a class who aie counted only by their
numbers, and are estimated to have no influence in public
affairs, save as a ma*s holding a certain position towards ca
pi tal
[Mr. Pickens here asked the floor, and was understood to
say, that he did not lay down the pioposition as broadly as
wa  stated by Mi. Mason He meant only to say that the
tendency of the institutions at the North was to organize capí
tal, and to make labor tributary to n, and, unless such ten
dency w^re checked, would finally íeduce labor there to a state
of rasealage }
Having thus given my objections to the passage of any law
at this time, which has not toi one ot its puncipal objects a
reformation of the i urreney, or, I should more properly say,
which will not by u<* operation, lead back the banks to a ie
sumption of bpecie payment, I pioceed buefly to suggest what
niy opinions aie of the ultimate attitude which the Government
should assume towards these institutions I have no expects
tion or belief, notwithstanding the cry which has been raised
against the bank**, through the piess and otherwise, thaby any
action of this Government these institutions can be destioycd
It is not in yom power to do so, sir, if you would, ind if attempt-
ed by any mean5*,direct or in lirect, eveiy eifoitthatyou could
make would eventuate in defeat They are cieated by the
qri,TS, are incorporated, and have life given to them by their
sep i ie law Foi then bemg, they lean upon the states,
an I are as entirely independent of you as you can ever become
of them Most of the States have a laige moneyed in tere t in
thei stock, and pai tieipatc la^l} m ttieu management by the
immediate appointment ol dm ctoi--.
Virginia has an nil nt w luud invented m her built , the
ne me fiom which is appropnated to education, to internal
impiovernent, and to othet favorite objects of hei S«ile policy
liesides all which, the banks of each Sta-e furnish to each the
entire papei circulation withm its boidere—a source of piofit
in which the States themselves largely participate Toi good
or foi ill, then, these banks are so closely mtei woven now, in
all their relation  with State mletests, that they cannot be eradi
eated even by the power upon which they depend for exis
ence
They enter largely into, and influence, to a great extent, all
the elements which affect the Uade of the countiy atid thus,
whether you are connected with, or divoiced fiom them, when
ever Uade or the course of exchange (in which they largely
deal) is deranged oi mjuied, youi finances will be immediate
ly affected You may be divorced ¡rom them a mensa and
axmcuks and should a period erei occur again when there
is a general suspension of specie payment, your Treasuiy will
s op payment m unison with the bank*, precisely as it has
done now, and the only diffeience between you will be, that
they will, stop payment as a measure of precaution, and you
from necessity
I say then, emphatically, that the present embauassed con
dition of the Treasuiy is not owing to its connection with the
banks You have not now money enough to the ciedit of the
Government, m all the banks north of the Potomac put together,
(the quarter wheie the principal revenue is collected,) to carry
on the Government for two weeks The Treasury is without
money, not because the banks have stopped payment, but be
cause its supplies are cut off Its revenue is stagnant in the
barniz of its debtors, and not in the vaults of the banks There
is money enough due to you, but you cannot get it m, and so
it is precisely with the banks You and they are both obliged,
being operated upon by the same causes, to give time to your
debtors, and to wait for the reaction of trade, the > evival of com
merce, before you can again get afloat
Neither is this reasoning at all weakened by the fact that you
have some five or six millions yet on deposite m the Southern
and Western States, which is styled "unavailable"—meaning
that yon cannot command it fox u«te You cannot command it,
simply because you have no use for it in the place where it is
In the Northern and Eastern States, where you had use for
money, you have withdrawn it rapidly since the suspension,
and so yon would have done from those «South and Weit, could
you have used the money at the place where it was Suppose,
then, that this money, instead of being on deposite in the banks,
was locked up m Sub Treasuries in gold and silver Five oi
six millions of bullion is too large a sum to be suddenly trans-
ferred from, one quarter of the country to the othei, without
producing very serious effects upon the trade and business of
those places whence it is taken, and yet you would have no other
resource whatevei m order to make it " available," but to bung
it away in bulk, transporting it at heavy cost across the conn
try, fiom the place where it was collected to the place where it
was wanted
You could not command a dollar by means of exchange, foi
the very causes that now make your deposite "unavailable"
there, have íun up exchange to rather more than the expenses
of transportation, and thus that whole fund, even if now in gold
and silver, aid in Sub Treasuries to boot, would be juntas
unavailable to Government, in the present condition of the coun-
try, as then deposite is m the ba ks mentioned Government
would not attempt to bung away the tin tal The countiy would
not allow itselfto be thus drained, oi, if it were done, the very
operation would o^en the people's eyes to the working of the
michirci/, and all would cry out against it No, sn, if this
'who1" unavailable fun I' m the 3outh and West were now
locked up there in gold and silver sooner than encounter the
cost and risk ol transpoitation, and the clamoi that would be
larsedaguna umtho e States, we should go quietly to work, as
we aie now doing, and issue Treasury notes to answer in its
place, until the icistoration of trade to its accustomed channels
would allow it*, being made available, by the use of bills ol
exchange
Tieatwg the bank.., then, as they certainly are, institutions
dependent foi their bein,* upon the States alone, and yet exei
cismgso mipoitant am .fluence upon tlietiadeand busmen of
the countiy, it becomes us next to mqi ne what is the best and
¡safest íelaüon m which the Government can place itself towards
them, to avoid as f i as may be, a lecuirence of the evils under
which we now iihoi1
In the fiifct place I '-ee no prioi necessity, either as regaids
the welfaie ot'he Go\ernment or the banks, for any connection
between ther \ or ver A sudden iftd violent separation,
such as is conic j plated '^y this oill, I have airead) said would,
in my judgment, he impiacucable, m the present condition of
the country I believe the tiansitioit (from the state of things
which sucha "divorce" would create) would be to a national
bank, as inevitably as fi m anarchy and confusion a people
always seek íelief m despotism
The process of sepaiuion must he giadual, after li is com
menced, and it  commencement must await the entire recovery
of trade, accompanied as such íecoveiy w ill be, by a sound and
healthful cuuency, that is to say, a euirency, so far as it is of
papei, convenible into specie at will
The Government may, I think, undei such circumstances,
and at such time, confine its receipts to gold and silver, and
withhold its iGvenue, while resting between collection and dis-
bursement, from all use, whether of banks or othei s
I am aware that «trong objections hold to keeping so much
money idle a^ would lemain pei manently on hand under any
system that may be ulopted But my decided impiession is,
nevertheless, that the pationage and political influence with
winch its  use by tln.bc eoiporatioii^ must be attended, togKlvev
with the greit incentive which it «ifeis to over dealing, aie ob
jections far strongei And from such inaction of the public
money, I should look foi another great piactical good It would
mvue, in the most urgent manner, is a fixed policy, a scale of
revenue reduced to the lowefot standard of the mosf econon ical
Administration
\nd again, by confining its leieipts to gold ind silver the

REMARKS OF MR. RENCHER,
Of North Carolina.
In the House of Representatives, September 26, 1837 —On
the bill to pobtpone the payment to the States of the fourth
instalment of the surplus revenue
Mr REIsOHER «aid he did not feel as the gentleman from
Virginia, (Mr Meicei,) who had ju^t taken his seat, animated
with the hope of being abletothiow additional light upon the
subject now under considpratmn, but he could not foi bear ex
pressing briefly the reasons which induced him to vote against
the bill In doing so,(sai iMr R ) I will not follow the exam
p'e so repeatedly set me, of wandeung mta the discussion of
othei matters, but shall confine myself <¡tr ctly to the bill now
before the committee I am called upon to suiiender upa
large amount of rnone^ set apaitby a former act of Congress
for the use of the people 1 iepreaent Before I can do so, Í must
be thoroughly satisfied that it is necessary foi the v. ants of this
Government, and, satisfied of that, Uhoukl net hesitate tod it
notwithstanding the deposite law That law was pa^&ed for the
benefitof the States, and I do not concur with many of my
fi tends that it cieated such a contract between the States and
this Government as to make it legally binding on us to pay
ovei this money, oi mcui the chaige of violated public faith
Butweallconem m thi& that the deporte law of 1836, autho-
rizing the dt&i lbuuon of a large amount of public money,
cieitedaieosonable expectation on the paitof the States that
it would he done, unless we weie pievented by the necessaiy
v, mtsoi the Government That necessity does not exist, and
this bill is not to relieve this Government, but to jc attach to it
a large amount of surplus re\ enue, and to swell again that pa-
tronage and powei of which it was depuved by the depo&ite
law It is not the Government, but the patty now m powei
that cannof get alono- without the political inflii nee of this
public money, and I have been btiuck with the remarkable fact
that those genitt men wno have shown mo-n zeal m favoi oi re
calling thefouiih instalment won oiií nüly oppo^dto the dc
posite law They *e t, then unwi n „ ha* the 1 ederal Go
vemment should be depuved oí i us ¡^ ge amount ot public
patronage, and aie now mo^t anxious, undei vairü-<s pie ten ees,
to tecali it Tho deposite law, wh i h has been so much al ut>
ed, was a most salutaiy measure like the quality of meicy, it
has blessed both the givei and receiver While it has cut off
fiom thr> Government mwhof isconupt anddangeioua pa
tmna£!e it has and will jsnable the Slates to ¡=caiter bletjoings
among their people w)iere let mcabk, but for this deport o
law, would now be the who e ainJimt of the suiplu-s revenue
