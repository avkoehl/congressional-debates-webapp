THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 26 
a meeting of young men of Philadelphia, opposed
to the couise of the Secretary of the Treasury m
removing the deposites
Mi PRESTON said that he desired to take this
opportunity to make a remark or two upon a
memorial which he intended to present, from a
meeting of citizens of the th rd congressional
district in Pennsylvania It came from the young
gentlemen of Philadelphia, and he thought, coming
from such a souiee, 1' presented an instructive
lesson It proceeded from a class of citizens who
were uncoirupted by the world, and it therefore
spoke the lessons of wisdom The sentiments
thus avowed weie natural and proper, and neces-
saiy to the tunes in which we lived These young
gentlemen represent that theConstitutionhasbeen
violated, and the laws trampled upon We had
now beenuiscussmg this subject three months—
the whole continent had been shaken by its ab-
sorbing influence, and in the midst of all these
things, occunences have taken place, and are daily
taking place, which would shake our reasons under
other circumstances We see one of the depait-
ments of this Government bankrupt to the amount
of $500,000, and yet it passes unnoticed But who
was it that performed this act' The Secretuy of
theTieasury' No ButtheSecietary of thePies-
ident of the Unite 1 States—a Secietary not con-
fiimed, or offered to be confirmed, by the Senate
We were now here, almost at the first of Apri',
and the extraordinary spectacle was presented of
thieehigh officers of the Government exercising
then duties, without then offices being confiimed I
by the Senate And what was the situation of i
our foreign íelaüons' One court, high up the
Baltic, was entirely without a repiesentative, kept
open foi negotiation Another more mipoitant
one, the Court of England, has been for two
years without a repiesentative there—a Govern-
ment where, according to the President's admis-
sion, negotiations of the most important nature
weie lett pending An army of soldiers were
marching and lountermarching through seveialof
theStatesofthisUnion,andyetnothnigafiectedthe
public mind, such was the interest and anxiety in
the piesent state of things At no period of the
Government had thete ever been such a congre-
gation of remarkable facts "collected together It
may well be said that we were in a revolution,
hitherto bloodless, but it was not so now Mur-
der had been committed, blood had been spi't, the
life ofanindividual had beensacuficed.m perform-
ing a duty secured to him by the Constitution
And what imptession did this make' The name
of the individual who has fallen he hardly knew
Petitions and memorials were showenng in here
from all quarteis, complaining of this usurpation
of power, and gentlemen say, Have patience, and
all will be well Yes, when the distiess has at-
tained its utmost limit, then we shall have relief
When the storm has prostrated the forest, a new
growth will take place They make a solitude,
and call it peace
Mr BROWN desired to make but a remaik or
iwo in leply to the gentleman fiom South Carolina,
[Mr Prisión,] and he would take the occasion
to congratulate gentlemen upon their reinstatement
in their foimer situation He thought he perceived
f n some days past their phalanx waveung—that
theie was not the same unity of sentiment upon the
violated hws of the country They stated the
issue to be one thing We said it was anothei,
that the Birk of the United States was the issue,
ai d a bill was afterwards brought forward to re
i barter the bank, and the honorablegentlenian fiom
Massachusetts opened the discussion This was
continued for sevial days, gentlemen now saw
tnat it was not the proper question to be presented,
and the issue was withdiaw n We were-then upon
the samegiound upoi whicn we had been placed
for some days past, and the tones of sympathy and
disti ess were again íepea ed The gentleman from
South Carolina prefaced his observations by stating
that he had a memoual to piesert from the í/oirai?
men of Philadelphia, a circumstance which pecu
ha ly marked the piesent time It did maik the
presert time, when young men were foiled to fiiht
the battles of the United States, Bank It was em-
inently chaiactemtic of the present time What
did the bank do ' It was flying to take refuse
among the boys of the country But tonoiabie
gentlemen thought the elections would decide the
question    They would decide it    Look at the
elections since the lemoval of the deposites   Have
they rot triumphantly sustained the Administra
tion '   Witness the resmt of the elections in Vir
gima and New Hampshire     The gentleman also
asked, what was the situation of oui foreign rela-
tions at this time'And what was it, Mi  B  wou'd
also ask '   The dignity, elevation, prosperity, and
success of the Administration in this brarch of the
public service was read in the eyes of the nation
Never was there a period in our histoiy when a
patnot's heart had gieater reason to be gratified by
the success of oui foreign relations     What old
subjects of controversy were there that wore un
settled under this Administration' Subjects which
had baflled the exertions of the most able states
men of thecountiy heretofore had been honorably
adjusted     Theie was no foreign court where tne
nation was not íepresented  by some one     The
Minister to Russia had but just left there     And
why was there nota Minister to England ' the gen
tleman asked     Why not'   The history of this
body gave the response—that history would show
that the nominations of the President were not
always confiimed    But it was said that the ten
dency of power was to concentrate in the hands of
one man     But if it were so, was there none in
that great corporation which was wielding apower
wholly unpaialleled in the  country     The bank
could drawdown no denunciat onsupon itfrom the
other side of the House     Repeated efforts v. ere
made to persuade the people that the President was
arrogating to himself the supreme power, the ím
pel ml purple     But when v. e look to his advanced
age, and reflect upon the long life which he had
devoted to the service of his country, can it be be
heved that he would do anything to tarnish that
fame which is, and ought to be, so dear to him '
He thought it necessary to say thus much in an-
swer to the gentleman trom South Carolina
Mr   PRESTON lemarked that the gentleman
from^ North Carolina [Mr Brown] said that the
memorial from these young men indicated the power
of the bank over the people     Mr  P thought that
it was not in the ranks of the young men that
advocates for the bank would be found     If they
obeyed impulses, it would be to cry out for the
hero    The bank could exercise no such power—
it was impotent for such puiposes    Let us not I
be told that the throes of the people in Pennsylva
ma and North Carolina, were all produced by the
power of the bank     The bank could not buy our !
paity     It was not thechaiacter of the country to I
be bought     He scorned the imputation     If every
bank in the United States was eiushed to atoms,
greater distress than now existed could not be pro- j
duced     He did not know whethei the absence of I
the Minister from England was necessary     But
the Chief Magistiate has said that important mat-
ters were under discission there    And the gentle-
man had said that the nominations were not made,
because nominations to the Senate were not always
confiimed
Mr BROWN rose to explain Hedidnotsay
that that was the reason why a nomination had not
been made, but that it was the reason why no Min-
ister was not now theie
Mr PRESTON fesumed The Senate then did
not think proper to confirm the nomination It
was a dangerous non-exercise of power to refuse
to nominate when it was said important negotia-
tions were then to be attended to Thepoweis of
the Senate were superseded—there were no nomi-
nations to foreign courts—no nominations to three
hi^h offices in the Government Theie was one
instance in lelation to ourfoieign affairs, to which
he would allude A part of the national debt, the
ii per cent , was about falling due, and the de-
partment had actually forgotten to give notice of
it, and the interest was running on to this day
Such were the circumstances under which the eoun-
tiy was placed
Mi FORSYTH said there wa3 one remark of
the honorable gentleman from South Carolina
[Mi Prestom] to which he wished to call the
attention of the Senate He alluded to the com-
plaint which the gentleman made that tne high
officers of the Government—the Secretary of State,
of the Treasury, and the Attorney Geneial—were
the officers of the President, and not of the United
States He believed the Constitution of the Uni
ted S'at^s authorized the President, dur ng the
recess of the Senate, to grant commissions to fill
vacancies, which should continue untu the end of
the next session of Congress The persons al-
luded to have their commibsions fiom the Pie idem
and whether they were here or not, for co fiima-
tion,they were officers of the United States lie
did not understand the point of the gentleman'i
complaint against the Pies dent for not tending
their appointments for confirmation Was it his
duty to do so ' It was his duty to send them be-
fore the time of adjournment, and then it was our
duty to pass upon them, and we had a right to
pass upon them How we should do so, the ma-
jority m this body would determine Was theie
an an\iety existing, in these al'usions, to embar-
íass the public affairs when the disastrous tffects
I" of proceedings here were already so agitating the
country ' Ti e President had pursued a just dio-
cret on, and he (Mr P ) could see no ol jection to
hisexeic smgit The two gentlemen [Mr South-
ard and Mi Prestom] had dwelt much on the
stiong evidence of public opinion manifested in
the proceedings of the youngmen in Philadelphia—
the young men, the junior classes of the country—
that they had no self interest, but weie guided by
generous gentle affections But we have had fre-
quent exhibitions of this sort before We have
had other meetings of yoing men and conven-
tions of young men, and if he recollected rightly,
the course of the last young men's convention here
bad been ovei shadowed by th  young men at
the ballot boxes, as they will be again It wis a
■very remarkable fac% that the city of Philadel-
phia, so conspicuous for her wealth, her vutue,
and her intelligence, rlways had the misfoitune of
being opposed to ti e people of the United States,
and of the State of Pennsylvania If you desire
to obtain the opinion of the people of the State of
Pennsylvania, go to Philadelphia, and the very
conveise of opinion there will be found to prevail
in ti e State It always has been so But these
young gentlemen are not to be bqught by gold, or
governed by the bank Well, he trusted the
people of Philadelphia weie all so But the truth
was, they saw through false media
He did not know that all their opinions were
regulated by passion, but who were so much so
as the young gentlemen of a populous city' There
wei e two principal divisions in Philadelphia, in one
of which all the young men there weie ranged—
bank and anti bank, and it was equivalent to an
expulsion from polished society not to be found on
the side of the bank Even the women were crying
out for the restorat on of the deposites, and how
could the young men resist the cries of the ladies'
But the gentleman and the people saw other more
dangerous encroachments upon their liberties__
that a formidable army had marched through one
State to attack anothei, and all this excited no at-
tention And why' Because the people knew the
purpose of it—they knew the object in view, and
approved the act—they went to enforce the laws
of the country, and the State of Alabama approved
the act, and was satisfied that the President was
right But the gentleman also says that the revo-
lution is no longer bloodless—that one murder had
been committed on a citizen exercising the elective
fianchise True, rumor said that an individual had
been lately severely beaten in Philadelphia, and
had since died But without a knowledge of the
circumstances, would the gentleman say that mur-
der had been committed, or that the deceased did
not merit the blow by which he fell' The reason
it excited no attention here was, that it did not be-
long to the United Stares Government, but lo the
government of Pennsylvania, and he had no doubt
justice would there be done And he wou'd siy
to that gentleman, that the introduction of that
topic here did not properly belong to peisons hoi d-
mg the opinions which we hold here upon State
rights It belonged to the action of the State gov
ernments The petitions complained ofan infirite
deal of public distress The people were deluded
into a belief that they suffered greater affliction
than war and famine could produce But could
we not see that it was greatly exaggerated ' He
had passed through the cities of Philadelphia and
New York, when he saw not a living thing in the
stieets—when the noise of his own feet was tein-
fying to him But was there anytmng prevailing
there now to be compared to this ' There was
distress existing it was true, but it was seized on
