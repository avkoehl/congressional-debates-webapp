Maine Boundary Question—Mr. Howard.
Ho. of Reps.
foundation for the belief that this question of ex-
clusive jurisdiction was conceded, the House
ought not now to pasa the bill under considera-
tion     To this aigament I wish to reply.
What will be the position of the question, if
the House should refuse to pass the bill ' Will
negotiation ensue' It will not. There is neither
time, nor opportunity, nor disposition to nego-
tiate under Sir John Harvey's menace of in\a-
sion Wc are told by the President (who has
taken his stand firmly and decisively) that if the
invasion of the State of Maine is persisted in,
he will consider the case as coming within the
scope of his power to bring the foices of the
Geneiat Government to her aid. After this pub-
lic annunciation of his opinion, even if he were
disposed to recede from his ground, he cannot.
Theie is not, however, fhe slightest reason to
suppose that any circumstances weald induce
him to change a position, not only maturely ex-
amined, but intrinsically correct Refuse to pass
this bill then, and where are you, and where is
the countiy' Should Sir John Harvey proceed
to execute his threat of attacking the troops of
Maine upon the banks of the Aroostook, it will
be the duty, as it is within the power, of the
President to call out the militia What says the
Constitution of the United States, and what say
the laws already in existence' The Constitution
says
" Congress shill have povvr r to piovide for <rUlin<r forth
the militia to ewcutc the Iiws oí the Union, suppress m
surr-ections, and repel invasions,"
In vnlue of this power, Congiess has passed
this law, (1795, chap S77-)
" Whenever the United States srnll be invaded, or be in
imminent danger of invasion, from any foreign nation or
Indian tribe, it shall be lawful for the i*n *ulent of ihe Uni-
ted Simps to call forth such number of the militia of the
State or States most convenient to the place oí danger or
scene of action is he in ty jnd¿e nccesslry lo ícpel such
invasion, and lo issue his orders for ih it purpose to such
officer or officer* of the militia as he shall think proper "
This power the President sayi he means to ex-
ercise Pass no law, then, make no appropna-
tion of money, adjourn, and leave the Piesident
to his executive power, unassisted by any Anther
legislation, let the Ropiesenttitives of the Amci-
ícan people refuse to sustain the Chief Magistrate
in tiie lofty giound which he has t tken, and what
will be the consequence ' You send him into the
field with the militia which he 1ms avowed his
deteimination to call out, ciipplid by youi lefu-
sal to aid him in the stmggle which every con-
bideiation of national honor calls upon him to
make—crippled, but not entnely disabled He
will call upon the imhtia of Maine, New Ilamp-
shite, and Massachusetts to can y the flag to the
invaded fiontiei He will use all his powei, de-
fective as it is without youi suppoit, to vindicate
the lights and honor ol the nation, and if he fail
to do io, it will be because you have refused lo
assist him Do you desire Urn ' Docs the gen
ilemin from Pennsylvania desne it? You may
deny the appiopnation, if you choose, and what
then ' The President will appeal to the pituot-
ism of those Sutes fiom which the militia will be
called ot t, and say to them " The Representa-
mes of the people of the United States have le-
fust d to give adollai to enable me to dischaigemy
high duty But no matter, cill youi miluiaoiit,
and raise the funds, upon youi Stxte ciedittopny
them, and we will appeal horeaftei to Congress
for your reimbursement " Will they not do it'
The membcis fiom those States can answer the
question I see it answered by then expressive
countenances. You may leave that poition of
the country to its fate, turning away with cold
indifference, but when the hour of trial conies,
the people there will not shrink from then duty
What, then, will you gain by refusing to pass
this bill  You cannot negotiate The case is not
fit for it A high officer of the British Govern-
ment has avowed his determination to invade a
part of the country which we all believe to be
nghtfully under the jurisdiction of Maine Will
you permit the invasion to go on, and the teru-
toiy to be occupied by a hostile fo.ee, and then
begin your negotiation for its removal > All that
can be done m the way of negotiation has already
been done by the Secretary of State and the Blu-
ish Minister But the latter says he has no power
over Sir John Haivey   With whom, then, could
you negotiate, if you were inclined soto do5 The
British Government is three thousand miles off,
and the question of invasion will be decided one
way or the other before you could hear fiom the
other side of the Atlantic This state of things is
not brought about by any fault of ours We gave
the British Government no reason for issuing such
orders to the Lieutenant Governor of New Bruns-
wick, if it did issue them. The alternative of
resisting, or submitting to, an invasion, is forced
upon us, wholly against our will, and we have
but one course to pursue Let us take our stand
by the side of the Piesident, and leave the conse-
quences to those who have brought on the crisis
so hastily that we have scarcely time enough to
do more than follow the natural instinct of self-
defense. I trust, most earnestly, that we shall
yet be able to preserve peace, but it is not to be
preserved by indecisive measures The United
States is not an antagonist with which any nation
is desnous to court a war, nor will any officei of
the British Government lightly encounter the re-
sponsibility of placing the two nations in an atti-
tude of hostility to each other If the invasion
goes on, and the President summons forth the
militia to íepel it, there is, at once, a state of war,
for war can be waged by militia I hope for
peace As long as it can be preserved with honor,
let us cheush it But peace is sometimes lost
thiough an over anxiety to maintain it. We aie
on the defensive, and theiefoie can, with propu-
ety, insist upon oui rights The people of the
State fiom which I come have no other interest
m this boundary question than that which belongs
to them as members of the Union, and probably
no other part of the countiy would suffei moie
inconvenience fiom hostilities, if they should
finally be foiced upon us. But, I much mistake
their character, if they are not always prepared
to bear their full shaie of all consequences which
may follow from the maintenance of the lights
and honor of the United States
The gentleman fiom Pennsylvania has called
this a " new issue," and deprecates putting the
boundary question upon any new issue. I, for
one, do not wish to avoid that new issue,because
the question upon oui side is so cleai that the
people can at once undeistand it The boundary
question is cleai enough after being studied, but
you must have maps and books and documents
to compiehcnd it The aigumcnts used by both
panics befoie the King of the Netheilands fill a
laige folio volume It is tiue that their essence
can be compressed into a much smaller space,
but with all this condensation, how much more
simple and intelligible is this " new issue" which
is deprecated ' In five minutes any man of the
most ordinal y intellectual powers can understand
it In fact, it is rather felt than understood by
argument The statement of the case is enough.
You have only to go to a householder, whether
he resides m a cosily mansion in one of youi
laigc cities, or a plnmci dwellin? in a valley of
tl c mountains, and tell him this " You and your
family have been living in this house foi thnty
yeais. One of youi neighbors claims youi land,
and, without waiting for the case to be decided,
is coming, with the bayonet, to drive you out
into the stieet or the woods What will you
do'" The answer would be, in the language of
this bill, " arm and resist'" Poice shall resist
foicc Sn, every man in this countiy can undei
stand this new issue There is no argument
necessaiy to explain it If we take our stand
upon it, it is impossible that we should go
wrong
But it is said that the passage of this bill is un-
necessary, because the Lieutenant Governor of
New Biunswick must have misunderstood his
oiders I hope he has Pel haps it is so Butat
best, it u only a chance that lie has, and another
chance that he will think so. And aie we to es-
timate chances in such a prospective legislation
as that now before us' What aie the chances '
two to one, thiee to one, or four to one' And
after we settle this calculation, we have to decide
what íatio would justify us in omitting to pro-
vide foi the defense of the country What aie
the facts upon which the calculation of chances is
to be founded' An intelligent Btitish officer,
high in the confidence of hisGovnninent,asseits
that his ordeis are plain and peiemptoiy.    I¡> he
able to comprehend his orders' And if so, has
he firmness to execute them' Gentlemen must
calculate these chances as they choose, I can fur-
nish them with no data. But then it is said that
he will yield to the powerful interference of the
British Minister at Washington. No doubt that
influence will receive, as it merits, great and care-
ful consideration. But his orders from his Gov-
ernment aie before his eyes, and, after alt, it is a
chance whether he may not prefer to abide by
what he believes to be then import We aie
doing nothing offensive in this bill. It cannot
be too fiequently repeated that its character is
wholly defensive.
But it ís-asked what necessity is there for the
first section of this bill, if the President has al-
ready the power to call out the militia, in case of
invasion, under the act of 1795' The question
is easily answered. It is to reinforce the author-
ity of the executive branch of the Government by
showing, that in the opinion of the legislative
branch also, a case of invasion, under the Consti-
tution of the United States, would ause, if the
movement of Sir John Harvey is earned on. It
is to show that upon this point the American
Government is a unit, prepared to act with all the
power which the people of the United States have
put into its hands. And here let me say, that at
the proper time, I shall move to fill up the blank
in the appropriating clause,undei the instructions
of the committee, with the sum of $10,000,000
I am aware that much objection exists to the
second section of this bill, which proposes to
raise twenty regiments of regular tioops, if the
contingency provided for in the first section shall
happen After stating the reasons which induced
the committee to lecommend this measure, it will
be for the House to judge of its expediency The
bill, it will be perceived, contemplates an early
call of Congress by the President, in case the bol-
der difficulties increase. Tbeieis an express pro-
vision to this effect; and, indeed, without it it 19
scarcely lo be supposed that the Piesident would
willingly encounter the very serious troubles that
would beset him, without calling the legislative
powei to his aid But the case is expies&ly pro-
vided foi Should the emergency ause, and a
new Congress be convened, one of the fiistmeas-
uies which it would adopt, in the opinion of the
committee, would be the passage of a bill just like
this second section. If a collision should ensue
between the United States and Great Britain, the
severity of the struggle is too apparent to be ovei-
looked for a moment. The wai would not be like
the last.
There are now hovering over our frontiers from
fifteen to eighteen thousand regular troops, the
choicest oí the Butish aimy. Whethei all this
force is brought there to quell the Canadian le-
volt, or to bear upon the settlement of ihe bound-
ary question, it is impossible to say But there
they are reported to be. The line between us
\nd Canada will become the field of battles, not
of two or thiee thousand men on each side, but
of five or ten times that number The military
power of.Gieat Butain will be concentiated to
one spot, and we must prepare, in case of need,
to meet it effectively Regular troops must be
resorted to, and the sooner the bettei. It is cruel
and unwise to march militia alone into the field
for a campaign against regulai tioops As aux-
iliaries we must always rely upon them, but we
ought to have in the field an equal number of reg-
ular troops with our adversaiy, man for man If
the contingency shall happen, upon which this
bill is to become effective, and a special session
of Congress shall be convoked, the time which
intervenes between the summons and the meeting
can beadvantageously employed by the Secretary
of War in filling up the ranks of the regiments
by recruiting with the money which you are
asked to place at the disposal of the Piesident.
But still, if any other species of force shall be
more acceptable to the House tnan that suggested
by the committee, I will yield to then judgment
As to the opinion expressed by the gentleman
fiom Pennsylvania, [Mr Biddle,] that this is
meant as a tin eat and bi avado on the pait of the
committee, I utterly disclaim any such view
Mi. BIDDLE. 1 certainly had not the slightest
idea of applying such an expression to the course
of the honorable gentleman fiom Mai y laud, [Mr.
