APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

25th Cong- --2nd Sess.
Mr. Calhoun's Resolutions—Mr. Sevier, Calhoun, Clay.
Senate.
wished not to introduce, not that he himself did
not take higher ground, but for the sake of avoid-
ing discussion and controversy on the part of those
who did not
Mr C could not indeed conceive why any gen-
tleman should seek to cteaie excitement by intro-
ducing matters on -which it was well known there
existed great variety of opinion, and "which
would consequently create division
It was his object to allay excitement—to pro-
mote union and unanimity, by omitting all topics
of collateral controversy, and embodying together
all such arguments and considerations as the coun-
try would generally assent to In. doing so, he be-
gan with making a sacrifice of his ow n views and
feelings for the sake of obtaining harmony and
peace It appeared lo him, that to mix up -«any
controverted topics with one single subject of con-
troversy, was in fact to multiply opponents against
that single point, and to raise up enemies where
otherwise it would have none Could it be possi-
ble that the/i mds of a measure would sincerely
wish, by violence and pugnacity, to create and
multiply enemies to their own cause? Was this
friendship to the cause and rights of the South?
Such, however, appeared to Mr C lo be
the very effect and consequei ce of that ul-
t-aism which m some quarteis was exhibited
on this subject With a view, therefoie, in ac-
cordance with the disposition he hid expressed, lo
strip the question as much as po siblc of all incen-
tives to irritation and provocatives to opposition
and enmi*}, he would m ive to strike out that por-
tion which related to slavery among the Indnn
tribes, and also all that portion of the resolution
which touched upon the question of the Spanish
treaty o<" 1819
Mr SEVIER expressed his concurrence wih
Mr CiAYas to the inutility of inserting so much as
related to the Spanish treaty of 1819 Mr S
had looked into that treaty smce last evening, and
found to his great astonishment that it did not con-
tain any guaranty of "private property," and
therefore its effects as to the guaranty of slaverv
was nugatory And yet those words had been in-
serted in the treaty of 1803 of wmch this trettv
was in all its other parts and language almost a
liberal transcript
As to the question of slavery among the Indians,
Mr S hoped that they would be protected in their
lights Some of them were great s'aveholdciSjand
had as many as a hundred negroes Ht wished
theiefore, lo include them, lo cover all the ground,
and to stop the "gait" of the Abolitionists m this
quarter also The Ab ihtionists, it is true, h id
hitherto overlooked them, but there were as many
as twenty tribes ui bis neighborhood, (Arkansas,)
and he was anxious that this clause should not be
stricken out, but that the poor Ind ans should be
protected in their rights
Mr CLAY said that he had ¡nmseif been nndor
the same impression as to the tiealy of 1819, and
had thought that the guaranty referred to had bun
inserted in the treaty oí 1819 He found, ho  ever,
that he wis mistaken, and tho e particulai words
had been omitted, white in eveiy other respect the
treaty of 1803 had been almost literally copied
The omission, however, could not have been by
design, as the treaty was made m the administra-
tion of Mr Monroe, w hen all his Cabinet was com-
posed of gentlemen from the siaveholdmg States,
who would not have assented to any omissions on
this subject
As to what concerned the Indians, how evei, he
(Mr C ) must persevere in his motion to strike out
that part of the resolution, and he did not think that
Mt Sevuk would think it necessary to introduce a
new topic of excitement, by bringing into dispute
the subject of slavery among the Indian tribe 
Mr C '•aid that, by the compromise act the
existence of slavery had been limited i i its extent,
so as not to be permitte 1 north boy ond a certa n
line of latitude and he thought tint there were no
Indian tribes who had s'aves be> i nd that line
which the act bad fixed up n    s its b mndary
Mr SEVIEU replied ml <-p«i tli it the Cliero-
kees who were slaveholders, and had been re-
moved across the Mississippi, had gone north of
that line, and had carried their slaves with them
Also, some counties of Missouri had feeen lately
extended be\ond that Une, so that now slavery
was planted beyond the boundary line with n
which ihe compromise act had confined it This
circumstance had been absented to at a former
session, and the Senator from Vermont himself,
(Mr Swift,) as a member of the Indian Commit-
tee, had not objected to it.
Mr SWIFT was understood to say that he had
never directly assented to this thing It had been only
touched upon incidentally, and he had never had
an opportunity of giving his iie^aa.e to the ques-
tion.
It was then by consent determined that that part
of the resolution relating to the tieAty ot 1S19
should be stricken out
The question as to sinking out the portion of tho
resolution lelating to slaveiy among the Indian
tribes, was then taken, and Mr SEVIER having
called ioi the yeas and nays, it was decided in the
affirmative—vets "51, nays 10, as follows
YF4S—Messrs Allen, Bayard, Benton, Black,
Btown, Buchanan, Clay of Kentucky, Clayton,
Crittenden, Cuthbeit, Grundy, Hubbard, King,
Lvon, McKean, Meuiek, Moins, Ntles, Norvell,
Pierce, Pientiss, Ficston, Rtves, Roane, Robbnis,
Smith of Connecticut, Smith of Indi ma, Swift,
Tipton, AVilliams, and Young—¿1
«AYS—Messis Calhoun, Clay of Alabama,
Ful on, Lumpkin, Nicholas, Robinson, Stviei,
Strange, Walker, and White—10
Mr KING proposed that so much of the lesolu-
tion as made mention of the compromise act should
be stricken out
Mi CLAY expressed his readiness to asseut to
this rnodihcation, and it was stricken out accorel-
ignly
The resolution having been then read a*, mod i lied,
Mr HUBBARD caucti for the yeas and nays,
which were accordingly ordered
Mr CALHOUN slid that the yeas and nays
having been ordered, he wished to state why he
could not vole for the resolution as amended
The mini reason assigned in the lesolution as it
now stands, why slivoiy should not be abolished
in riornh, was that it would be highly inexpedient
He icgardnl tht icison as wholly fallact >us, and
that i! would be of not the si glnest foicei n slav-
ing the tide of Abolition We must bear in mind,
lhat the two points towards winch the Abolitionists
are directing the ir attacks, were this Dislr ct and
the Termor rs These they considered om weak
points, and they weje sanguine in the belief, and
that not without reason, i! they can cftect tleir
objects theie, the -nun diliiculty in their way
would be surmounted Willi tlu« knowledge, our
pobcy ought m be lo ^trpngthen and fortify those

1 iting plighted tauh, and subvening trie entire
fibnc oi our poulical system, and, as such, aie
guilty of violating the most solemn obligations,
political, moral, and religious.
Mr C next objected, that he disliked the desig-
nation of the particular Territory of Florida The
Abolitionists ask to abolish slavery in ihe Territo-
ries, and we reply, that it is inexpedient to abolish
it in Florida, assigning for a reason, that it was our
only Territory in which slavery existed. They
make a general demand, extending to all Ter-
ntories that now are, or may be hereafter,
created, and we meet this broad and sweep-
ing prayer with the modest answer, that it is
inexpedient to abolish it in Florida. In giving this
diffident response, are we afraid of offending, or
aie we indisposed to commit ourselves, as to Terrt-
toi íes hereafter to be created?
He regarded the grounds assumed in the resolu-
tion, as amended, worse than useless They are
calculated not to repel, but to attract attacks
He was glad that the portion of the amendment
winch referred to the Missouri compromise had
been struck out He was not a member of Con-
gicss when that compromise was made, but it is
due to cantlor to state, that his impressions were in
Us favor, but it is equally due to it to say, that
with his present experience, and knowledge of the
spmt which then, for the first time, began to dis-
close itself, that he had entirely changed his- opi-
nion He now believed that it was a dangerous
measuie, and that it has done much to rouse into
action the present spirit Had it then been met
with uncompromising opposition, such as a then
distinguished and sagacious member from Virginia,
(Mr Randolph,) now no more, opposed to it,
abolition might have been crushed for ever m its
birth He then thought of Mr Randolph, as, hp
doubts not, many think of him now, who have
not fully looked into this subject, that he was too
unyielding, too uncompromising, too impracticable;
but he had been taught his error, and took plea-
sure in acknowledging it
Wnh these views (said Mr. C ) he could not vote
feu the resolution as it stood, and they were greatly
strengthened, when he contrasted it with his fifth
lesolution, which has been struck out to insert this
That lesolution declares that any attempt, by any
State or States, or their citizens, or any act or mea-
sure ol Congress, to abolish slavery in this District,
oi the Ten Hones, on the ground that it was im-
moial, or sinful, or otherwise obnoxious, was a
dangerous attack on the domestics institutions of all
the States Now (said Mr. C ) what have we
clone? what have Southern Senators done? Struck
el >wn the strong barriers which placed ihr* District
and the Territories under the same high constitu-
tional pro'ection with the States themselves, and
which made an assault on them an assault on all
ihe slat eholding States, and have erected in their
plae e the most ieeble of all barriers, that of mere
un xpeelicncy Why was this done? Was it be-
cause the resolution struck out asserted any
thing false m facf or principle? No one pretended
to ,ay so No it is time to speak out, to tell the
tru tli, it was because there was more dread of wound-
ing the feelings oí the Abolitionists than the people of
the s'avoho'Jmg States They are more intent on
our destiuclion that we for our own safety They
maik met punish, by withholding their votes, and
throwing them m the opposite scale, all who dare
oppose them, while a fee mg of indifference and
inauention prevails on the part of the people of the
slavcholduig Slates
I bus regarding the resolution as it stands, he
was placed in a position which he did not often
occupy He could not vole for it, for the reasons
hi has stated, and he would not vote against it for
reason which must be apparent to all, and he'was
of cour e constrained not to v ote at all
Mr    NORVELL   spoke   briefly   against   Mr
Ct ay's second substitute, as now modified
Mr CLAY of Kentucky said be was very son y
that the Sena or from Seuth Carolina could not re-
concil" bis ju \¿ nent to vote for the resolution now
under consideration II? thought the declaration
in tie iciolntun, that abolition was inexpedient
was not strong enough, and that higher grounds
emg A to be assumed But what htghei grounds?
Was any one prepared to say that the naked power
of pboUt.on did not exist? Mr C spoke of the na-
ked powei, and not of its exercise, but the.abstract
question of the existence of the power Now
though it did not exist in relation to the States, on
