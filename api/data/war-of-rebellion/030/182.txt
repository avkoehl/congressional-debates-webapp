HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING,December 15, 1862-7 p.m.

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE, Chief of Staff:

COLONEL: The following communication has this moment been signaled from General Van Cleve's headquarters:

A messenger, just arrived, reports all the cavalry outposts captured by the enemy while a flag of truce was waiting an answer from General Rosecrans. Will send particulars as soon as received.

H. P. VAN CLEVE

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, Commanding.

The general has been out along our front all day, which accounts for sending several papers without his signature. He is now in bed.

HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Nashville, December 15, [1862]-11.20 p.m.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Commanding Left:

GENERAL: The general commanding desires you to instruct your outguards hereafter not to receive a flag of truce from the enemy unless the officer in charge of it produces an order or other written authority from the general commanding the enemy's army, or his lines in front, accrediting him a bearer of the flag; and these credentials must be forwarded by the officer commanding the outpost to the general commanding that portion of our front; for General Orders, Numbers 16. from these headquarters are so far modified as to permit corps commanders, or detached division commanders commanding portions of corps, to receive flags and dispatch officers of their own staff for this purpose, thereby avoiding the delays which would ensue from a reference to these headquarters.

I am, general very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.

(Copies sent to Generals Thomas, McCook, Rousseau, Negley,and Stanley.)

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
