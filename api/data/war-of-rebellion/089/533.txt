HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,November 6, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I am and have been for some time picketing nearly a brigade front of the Fifth Corps, between Battery 24 and Fort Howard. I request that these pickets may be relieved, that I may picket only my own front. They are in such a position that I cannot readily support them.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 6, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

Captain Paine will be sent to establish the point of junction of the picket-lines of the Second and Fifth Corps. It should be northwest from Battery 24. Please have your officers instructed accordingly.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,November 6, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

General Mott's loss last night was four killed abbot fifteen wounded and one officer and two enlisted men missing. Twelve dead bodies of the enemy are lying near the picket-line. The enemy's entrenching tools and many of their arms are in our possession. No attempt was made to recapture the posts taken from Gibbon, as they were the only ones across the pond, and ought to have been abandoned before and the line placed where it now is.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.

CONFIDENTIAL.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

November 6, 1864.

Major-General HANCOCK,

Commanding Second Corps:

In view of the fact that a general election is to be held in the army on Tuesday next, the 8th instant, it is considered probable that the enemy may attack with the hope of finding us unprepared and of breaking up the election. Corps commanders will, therefore, see that the strictest vigilance is maintained in their commands, and that their troops are prepared for any emergency that may occur.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

(Same to Generals Warren, Parke, and Gregg.)
