of the same kind. I have ordered out the militia forces near the scene of disturbance, and hope to have sufficient force, but much depends upon having a sufficient force promptly on hand. I have applied to General Roberts to detain the six companies of the Seventh Cavalry now near the scene of disturbance and send them there. It will cause a delay of but a few days. I ask your approval. Please answer.

Governor.

FRANKFORT, August 6, 1863.

Colonel J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

Permit me to say that unless the quota is raised within thirty days the draft in Kentucky will be ordered. This will aid recruiting. Besides, it is right. A draft ought to be made. The rebels ought to be made to play or pay.

Adjutant-general.

Colonel ROBERT NUGENT,

Actg. Asst. Provost-Marshal-General, New York, City:

You see the assaults in the papers on the enrollment in New York City. Call your provost-marshals together confidentially, go over the whole subject thoroughly, compare the lists carefully, and prepare a full statement that will carry conviction with it. Let this be done as soon as possible.

Provost-Marshal-General:

I have got through with Oswego without difficulty. Wish to put through the draft here-Eighteenth District-to-morrow. Have just received your notification that you wish to inform the Governor. Will you inform him by telegraph? I have with me ninety men. The draft ought not to be delayed a moment.
