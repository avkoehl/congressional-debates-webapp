PORTER'S HEADQUARTERS,

June 26, 1862-8 p.m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Engagement still continues with great vigor. The enemy have not gained a foot, and McCall is doing splendidly. He is showing that his division is equal to the veterans of the Army of the Potomac. Rebel force very large, but our position good, and our men as brave as can be. The stragglers are all to the rear of Morell's men. Just at McCall's. Dispatch as to re-enforcements this moment read. I thank you for them. I am rejoiced that the troops in front of Washington are to be placed under one command. Keep at that and all will be well.

I will answer for it that this army will do all that the country expects of it.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General Commanding.

I almost begin to think we are invincible.

Major-General, Commanding.
