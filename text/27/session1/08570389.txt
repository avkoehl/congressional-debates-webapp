REMARKS OP MR   PROFFIT,
OP INDIANA,
lit the  House of Rep/dentantes   Septembei 10, 1841—On
the Veto Message ol the Piesident, returning the fiscal Cot
poiation bill
Tne m t,=uge of the Pípsi lenf oi tl eUnte I S Ues returning
the bill to esttbhsh a Fiscil Coipotatijn, with his obj ctions
thereto, being under consideiation—
Mr PROFril baid Mr Spe?kei, lhaJ hoped that that the
debate upon tnis important question would have bee i con
ducted in a ¡na irier uiediuble to the national Legisl ifure I
had hoped tnat o or discussions would be confined to the subject
matter of the message ol the Lxecmm, and the merns of the
bill now before us, and thataigumoit, coutte y, and decorum,
would distinguish our del ibeiauons on so grave and momentous
an occaoion as the pi^sent But, su, I have been disappointed,
and, I must conf<i^, dc p y mortifi d at the course wmch
it has pleaded the gentleman fiom Vi gima [Mr Bo-m,] to
pursue
It must have been a c-ojiceof pain and ipgiet to every fnend
of peace and i an 10 ¡y to listen to the speech mile bv (hit gen
fieman—a speech, sir scucely glancing atthemfssig < r the
bill before us, but replete with the most denunci it ny ep tlitts
agamsr the public,an tht most feíooious a->s tints upon the
private ch naaet of the L\e utiw I ha g nt emiu fioui V r
gima has charvd upon the Piesident 'nuhly," tieachtiy,3'
and piostitution oi his oiTical ehaiactei loi seifi-.li and un
wormy purposes He has thoughtfit io compaie him with the
traitor Arnold and with (lull lie hassul th it this is not the
firs' time that lolin Tylei has been guilty of peifidy, but that,
oa raoie than one oteas o i, the charge had been made and
proved     He accuses the Pi evident a'so of equivocation
áir, I shall proceed to ta e not >_e of the gentleman's charges
in. the OLJer in which he has made th m,amt I now give notice
to him that I will ho d him to the piool of uieaceusdUo is male
upon this fluoi under the responsibilities of an A menean Re

lect material fui the i8s«,uit                                      '
When, Mi speaker, i ht/ud the gentleman de laie, on a
former occisión, that he 11 tended to pro/e the Executive guilty
of these o li jus charge , 1 h light that he was bpealiing under
momentary ox itement, an 1 that time for reflection and go >d
cumnel would m luce linn to pursue a diffeient course I
could not believe i p usibie that the gentleman would persist in
a determination so palpably uiwiseatl mptO[Ct Whatever
private griefs and personal en mtica he might entertain, I could
not believe that this Hall w >uld be selected as a fitting place ior
their avowai and expn&mi,
Anticipating aslhid adebife upon the ments of the bill
now b.'f>re us, I hadpiepaied myself with aiguments to meet a
fair and open discussion of its prmcip esand ten lencies I had
also taken some piins to collect authoiuies, judicial and fin m
cial, to maintain the positions which I had asbum-^d when the
bill was befoie the H >use It would be worse than useless to
present them now Tins Hou-^ is not in fitting mood to listen
to atgum¡*nt on a quest on ot finance, an i, irnm the niannei of
opening this debate by ihe gentleman fiom Vuginia v.who ap-
pears to have done so hy the universal consent of the ft ¡en Is
with whom heacson thisq icstion ) I know that it would be
vain to ask dispassionate and calm attention I shall then, at
once proceed to notiie the gentleman's íemaiks lie com
mencedby informing us that his peculiar position íequired
him to speak at this tim^, and in another patt of hi^ speech he
alluded to the fact of the Pie^iJent having leturned to him a
letter which he ha 1 addressed to him on the subject of a certain
celebrated communication g^neially denominated the "Co flee
house" correspondence I can well understand, Mr Speaker,
that the gentleman should eruei tain feelings of personal enmity
towards the Pre-i lent, as also a feeling of mortification at the
publication oí his uniortunately loose cone¡ pondeñce Bat,
sir, what interest has this Huu-,eor the country in his peculiar
position? What have we to do with his personal feelings to
warás the Eteco ive? What does th° coan ry care about the
published or unpublished cone^pondence of tne gentleman! In

man can publish his opinions oft ie President eitnei ma political
OF personal character He ran couch thosa op nions in the
form of a letter, and direct it to whom or to what he pleases  A
few days since he gave his views of the President to the public
m the form of a circular    lie can address anothei communica

received by bath Houses of Congie^s during this sesión, in

at the declaration of a want of time, especially if he will divest
himself foi a moment of his personal  feelings  and  calmly
conoide i thegieat importance of the questions mv lived inthis
sub] ctof the es ab i-hmpntof a fiscil a^ent of the Government
The gentleman tells us that the Piesident nbjerrg to the  fea
ture of the bill which, in his opinion,   authonze* local di-
counts, and then titumptiantly turns to the nrojel submitted by
the Secretary of the Tiea^ury, whit-h authorizes the same thing,
and charges the President witn inconsistency—avowing, as the
gentleman does, that the plan emanating fiom the Secretary
was approved oy the Piesident     Now, su, I deiy ttuu the
details of the plan submitted by the Secietary of tbeTieasury
evei were appioved by the President, and I call upon the gen-
tleman for pioof of   his assertion     But admitting, for argu
merit s sake, that it was submitted to and approved hy the
Piesident, and taking the gentleman's st?teme it that it was a
National Bnk with all the powers necessary to such an insti-
tution— vO  deal i i exchanges,   f«iei?n   and domestic—to dis
count local paper   &r    I ask thewrntleman  \vhy that plan
was tmme ¡lately refected'?   V\ hy was it pronounce! a "pool
rickety aiiairi '    Wh/, it you weie so anxious fot a Bank, did
you not at once accept of this plan?   If hp 1, you confers   all
the powers and privileges of aNational Bank    The gentleman
may say that it lequned the assent of the States to establish
branches, and therefore w 3 objectionable    V*ell, sir, so did
the first Bank bill yoa passed    But T may bp said that it only
aske 1 consent by indirection, oi   that it merely seemed to ask
the consent of the Sta'es   but in reality asserted the power
of Congress to establish branches   Then, sir, it was no com
piomise, as you have again and again asserted it tobe Itdid
not unconditionally íeqmre the went of the totate" and there-
fore did not meet the Piesident's objection, &o that, take the
question in eithei light, the gentleman h at fault in his charges
fen, he can gi ie us it he will, the reason for reacting the projet

U iving unshaken 1 nth in their delibeiate jndgimnt, I ftai not

I, an, have but one object m view—a sincere desire to pei-
foim my duty, to do justice to the Piesident, t> maintain the
pimciplts foi which I have contendtd fiom the days of my
boyhood to pioduce harmony and union amongst those wiih
whom I hive so long been associated, and to inculc nc conceb
sion and foibeuance in lieu of the nnfoitumtt spirit of strife
and enmity now so lamentable palpable I shall, therefme,
give buefly what 1 conceive to bo an analysis of the message
iiw before us The President s lye that he c mnot con
bcientioijsly appiove ot the bill, violatmc, as he beiievi"! it
does, the Constitution which he has sworn'to protect, prestive,
ami defend   '
Admitting (hat the veto power ought to be exeicised with
gteatcaut on, and as a "conservative powei," yet the Piesi-
dent justly says that no alternative is left to him if the bill
pifsenled is to his mind clearly vioUtivt oí the Constitution
He considtis the Constitution of the IJniteu Statis as the
"embodied and wihten will of the whole pun 1<, unanimously
adopied, and prescribing to the public functionaues imperativa
dunes                                                ,          .
He considtis that this bill, whKh piofestes to establish an
asentof the Government puiely national, giants powers not
icquned for the opeiations of the Government, and at war
with the Constitution He objects to the power cianted of
making local discounts as unntc^s^aiy to the fibcal operations
of the Government, and as subjecting the public funds to loss
and to improper uses by the officeis of the institution He con
tends that the permission to deal in exchanges without limita*
tion on time unlimited, with powei ofrenewabihtyunchecked,
and at lates of interest unrestrained, are poweis impioper tobe
granted, and liable tobe grossly abused, not only injuriously
to the Government, but to the people He contends that the
nower to deal in this kind of exchange is obnoxious to all the
objections made to local discounts. He denies the power
assumed by Congress to invest a local institution with gene
lal or n itional powers He contends that, under this bill, ficti-
tious bills of exchange can be drawn without limit, whereas all
operations? in exchange ought to be based upon a real and sub-
stantial basis, m other words, he is in favor of confining ihe
opeiations of the institution to true business ti ansactions
He considers that the bill would have a tendency to postpone
indefinitely the íesumption of specie payments by the banks.
He contends that an institution which is to continue in opera-
tion for twpnty yens*, and enjoy exclusive privileges!, the
powers «ranted to which are irrevocable, ought not to be thus
liable to objection, and that it woultl be ovei hazardous to pass
such a bill into a law
The President regrets the differences of opinion existing, sug-
gests that the mattei be postponed, and says that, at the reguldr
meetin  of Congress in Decembernexii it willbc his duty, under
the Constitution, to recommend such measures as he shall
md^e nece«ary and expedient These, I believe, are the lead
pinpoints in the message, and, sir, I have no doubt but that ihe
President, thiough the Secretary of the Trpasuiy, will at our
next meeting present a plan which, avowing constitutional
oblemos, Villi answer all ihe purposes of the Government, re
enlate, incidentally, the currency and exchanges, and receive
the sanction of Congress But, sir, if the spirit mam ested here
to day is fostered and encouraged—if, instead of courtesy and
kindness, we are to hear taunts and threats and denunciations-
I give up all hope of good resulting from the late contest, an<*
