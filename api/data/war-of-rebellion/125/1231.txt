I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NEW YORK, March 11, 1865.

Brigadier General J. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General:

I made my contemplated raid on the bounty jumpers yesterday and succeeded in capturing 590 of the most desperate villains unhung. Most of them have enlisted and deserted from three to twenty times each. They are most all in irons and will go to the castle on Governor's Island to-day.* I have been requested to pass them down Broadway in order that the people may have a sight of them. Is there any objection?

Please answer by telegraph.

L. C. BAKER,

Colonel, &amp;c.

WASHINGTON, D. C., March 11, 1865.

Colonel L. C. BAKER,

Astor House, New York City:

There is no objection to your having the bounty jumpers conducted through such thoroughfares in New York City as you deem proper.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S BUREAU, Washington, D. C., March 11, 1865.

Colonel L. C. BAKER,

Astor House, New York City:

It is represented that some of the arrests made by you are not based on sufficient evidence. I must again caution you on this subject. Do not make an arrest until Mr. Chittenden has pronounced the evidence ample until it has been forwarded here, examined, and the arrest ordered.

JAMES B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
