Gentlemen will not fail to observe that the
chairman of the Committee of ^ ays and Means
in his tables, in order to arrive at the results
he exhibits, and which he so vauntingly holds
himself responsible for. after striking out at
random such portions of tbe expenditures for
1871 as he sees fit, including all pensions,
premiums, and interest on the public debt, in
order to bring down the expenditures on a
peace basis, as he calls it, in 1871 toa>82,G04,-
604 08, and compare them as he professes to
do with like items of expenditure for the year
1800. takes c^re to leave charged to the ex^
pemiitures for the year 1860 the sum ot
$3,177,314 62 of interest on tbe public debt
paid during that year, and the further sum of
$1,J00.802 32, being pensions paid during the
year 1860, in order to swell the expenditures
of 1860 up to the sum he fixes m his table,
to wit, $03,025,788 98. I thought of course,
he had been misled by his official table-maker,
and that it was only necessary to call hrs atten-
tion to a blander, as I supposed it to be on his
part, to have it-corrected.
I confess that I was somewhat astonished,
and my faith in the fairness of the gentleman^
statement and of his purpose to make it fair
even from his stand-point was seriously shaken
by the following colloquy, which I take from
the Globe of to-day:
" Mr. Dawf.s. Mr. Speaker, I desire to make a
correction in some figures I gave when the emiier-
ence report on the tariff bill was before tbe House.
I find since they bave goao into .print an ©nor in
arithmetic in calculating: tho price ot goW. it is
grated the reduction ot $S6,604,tX)4 OS into gold at
112 wouid be $72,920,588 34, It,should ^aJeJ?.ee"
$73,751,110 78, making a reduction growing out ot
this nrot- 41. I cailed
tins correction so that any gentleman may
oec.tMon to use these figures may not iall into
"Mr. JJkck. Why not make this further correc-
tion ? . .
"Mr. Dawbs. What is it? „
44 Air Beck. i hope the gentlomao from Massa
chosetts will feel at liberty to further correct his
fable by striking out the item of83,177,31462,charged
ms expenditures of 1&>0 for interest on the public
debt, a.«he has stricken out of the expenditures for
1871. lor the purple of comparison with I860, all the
jutereift paid )n 1871.
*" Mr. Dawes. For all such deductions I gave the
reason."1 in the tables; and every gentleman will
judge for himself as to the weight of those reasons, j
The error I have just corrected being one of arith- i:
metie, might easily lead a person a-tray, and there- {'
fore I felt bound to correctit. As to those items of jj
deduction, for which, whether properly made or not, u
I have given the reasons, it is not necessary for me j
now to so over them.
"Mr.Beck. Then I understand the gentleman ;>
to «ay that while he struck out ail the pensions of |j
1871, and all the interest paid in 1871, he purposely jj
left in the pensions of 1860, and the interest paid m
1860; and that he considers the table in that respect
as exhibiting a fair comparison,
44 Mr. Dawes. lean tell the gentleman my rea-
son for putting those items in that form. The pen-
sions of 1S60 were those of the old pensioners oi the
! war of the Revolution. It was considered tbattb«y
; had all passed away between 1860 and 1871. lne
: public debt that was due in 1360 was an old ae*>t
. which fell due and was extinguished before 1871.
1 Those are the reason* for which those deductions
; have been made. As I hare said, every gentleman
< can judge for himself as to the propriety ot the de-
I ductions. But as to the error in arithmetic*-i nave
i hastened to correct it as soon as I could.'
; It, seemed to me so manifest that if all in-
j terest and pensions paid in 1871 were stricken
! out, for lhe purposes of fair comparison be-
j tween corresponding items of expenditure
i between that year and 18G0 interest and pen-
;i sions paid in 1860 should also be stricken out.
that 1 could hardly credit my own ears when
the answer which appears in tbe Giobe was ,
|; given. Was interest paid in 1860 either more ;
or less an expenditure of that year because ;
the principal of the debt may or may not have i
been paid off since ? Were the pensions paid ;
proper payments then be- '
| laws were violated, which gentlemen on the
! other side will be slow to admit. Therefore,
i it is necessary to turn to the appropria-
I tions for 1871 to see how they are made up.

Tbe Secretary of the Treasury states, (see
page S of Executive Document, No. 2, see-
that year any -— r--r- * ■
cause the pensioners may now be dead ; and ^  
why should interest, and pensions honestly due ; ^3 sesSion Forty-Second Congress,) that—
in 1871 be left out and similar iteins be charged
to 1860 when the avowed object is to make
comparison between similar items of expend-
iture in the two years and put them in con-
trast by the table? Would interest and pen-
sions paid in 1871 be in any way affected by
the subsequent death of the pensioner, or the
payment of the debt? Of course not.
1 think every fair-minded man will agree
that if these items are stricken out of the
account for one year they ought to be stricken
out as to both. That done, the charges agmnst
1860 must be reduced for these items $4,269,-
238 48. The gentleman from Massachusetts
i seemed to be nervously anxious to have his
' arithmetic correct, whatever _ else mijln be
! wrong, and therefore took pains to correct it
i promptly ; but it seems he is wholly unable to
I do justice to the Democratic administration
| of 1860, even when trying his best. He says
I the reduction to a gold basis ot tbe remnant
| of the expenditures of 1871 ought to have
i been only reduced to S73,7ol,110 78. instead
j of to $72,920,588 84 as be has it in his table,
; making a difference according to bis anthrne-
! tic of $633,522 44. Anybody else subtracting
i one of these sums from the other would have
i made it §833.522 44. The table will there-
fore, on fats own basis, stand thus :

It will thus be seen that a very small frac-
tion of the expenditures for 1871 were or
could be legally applied toward paying the
expenses of the postal-service, or of the 1 out
Office Department. That service was kept up
, and maintained by payments made directly by
; the people to the Department. _
i The Secretary, in his book of estimates for
! 1870-71, page'241, shows that the appropri-
ations for the postal service for the fiscal year
' 1ST0 were as follows: appropriated out ot the
general Treasury, $6,465,000, and out of the
, postat revenues, $23,814,155: total, $30,-
•J79 153 His estimate for the postal service
jj for 1871 is §12.417.131 21 out of the Treas-
j urv, and $25,581,093 out of the collections
.I made from the people by the Post Office l>e-
! partirtent, making a total of $38,000,224 21
;I required for postal service for tbe year ISil.

i; asked for 1871 out of the Treasury, giving ""JJ
I c!7-->7 000 The result was a deficiency in lo<^
of S3.969,383. (See book of estimates lor
1871-7'' pa e 201 ) Therefore it is certain
that a verr small fraction of the expenditures

retary of the Treasury, and the table ot the
