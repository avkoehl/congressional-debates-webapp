The above has mortified me and will disgrace me. Please inform me frankly if you disapprove of my conduct to-day, that I may know what to do.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac.
HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS,July 1, 1863-10 p. m.

The loss in my corps is about 3, 000 killed, wounded, and missing. In the two corps we have lost one piece of artillery. This position is plenty good for a general battle unless you fear its being turned at a considerable distance from Gettysburg.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General BUTTERFIELD.

Chief of Staff.
