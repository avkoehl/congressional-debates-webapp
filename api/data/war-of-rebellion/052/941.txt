Major-General BURNSIDE:

If the enemy move on you it may not be possible for us to succor you.

It seems to me you must concentrate at Kingston, refusing your left to Knoxville, and covering the space between you and us with cavalry.

Two divisions rebel infantry have been reported at Georgetown; not certain. Hill's corps is toward Cleveland. Polk's Longstreet's, and Johnston's corps on my front erecting batteries. What they intend cannot tell.

What is your force?
