mixed, part soldiers and part citizens, it will be impossible to prevent collisions, unless each division quartermaster attends to it in person. Regimental and company officers will be glad to get their men back, only no sooner do they succeed when an application comes for soldiers to act again as teamsters. Hold fast to all the citizen teamsters you can get; substitute them for soldiers in the corps train first, then in the division train, and finally in the regimental wagons; only make the arrangement permanent and uniform.

General CORSE:

Give your pickets at the ridge directions as to parties who seem to have information or important business. If any of your staff think the business sufficient, let the party come up without first sending to me. I have several parties at Brandon, who communicate with me by signals and ciphers.

SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General BUCKLAND,

Oak Ridge:

General Corse is very anxious to get his mounted patrol. Have you made any progress in getting some horses, saddles, &amp;c.? Please let me know how soon you will be able to spare these men. A flag of truce came in last night with Mobile papers to the 9th. Gillmore has possession of all of Morris Island, but Sumter holds out, its ruins affording a better cover against cannon shot than its finished walls. Burnside and Rosecrans are making good progress in East Tennessee.

Colonel MORTON,

Black River Bridge:

Dr. Plummer has shown me report of division surgeons that sickness results from the want of fresh meat and vegetables, reporting that fresh meat does not average once a week. No onions for four months, and about half a pound of potatoes per man per month. I heard of 1,000 barrels of potatoes in Vicksburg yesterday, and the commissary, Haines, at Saint Louis, tells the sanitary agent at Saint Louis that he need not send potatoes and onions because the department has full supplies here. Please report to me the facts.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
