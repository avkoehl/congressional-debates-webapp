HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,August 4, 1863.

Major General J. E. B. STUART,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: Your note, inclosing one from Fitz. Lee, was received. The corps of Longstreet and Hill will cross the Rapidan to-day, and the army will be concentrated south of the Rapidan. If we leave Culpeper, the enemy will enter it. If you can hold it without sacrificing your men, it will be well. So long as you remain, your supplies can be forwarded by rail to the Court-House, and you can inform Colonel Corley whether it will be safe. If you are forced back, it will be best to come back to the rivers, where you can get good grazing.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

I will, therefore, suggest that you destroy both copy and original, substituting one confined to casualties merely. I hope all will yet be well.

I am, with respect, your obedient servant,
