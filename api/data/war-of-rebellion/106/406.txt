Brigadier General G. WRIGHT,

Commanding Military Department, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: Intending to dispatch the Saginaw on important service beyond the waters of San Francisco, I have ordered the Cyane to this yard as a means of defense and as a preliminary step to making such repairs as she may require. The Shubrick will be quite sufficient for all police service, and when you have the contemplated batteries ready for use the fear of an attack from a rebel steamer in the rear will no longer exist.

I remain, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
