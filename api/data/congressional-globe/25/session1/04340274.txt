Mr Madison's Message of Decembei, 1^16 n '■h
has just been read by the gendeman the i
cumstances under wl ich it was \v title i, is vv °lt as
the language emplo) d, -will cl ally punt to is
meaning Specie payments hid been suspend 1
throughout the country, and oui ct"ii-"nrr h^n
as now, was compisctí of wontett b'e bails
paper. Mr Madison bad wuved 1 isc " U'utioml
objections to a Bank of the Unite! Si es it d 11
April, 1816, had approved the a t u en irtti ihu
institution Besides, Congress li til, m he vi it
month, adopted a re^o! tion to coir pel the pa -
ment of the public ties in specie, cr in the i oris
of spec e paying bat' s Mr Madt on lsiv dail y
speaking in reference tu these t«o measures in
t is extiact from hisMej?sage It is true, he c sserts
thit ti e Constitution has entrusted Congress ex-
c us veiy wi h the powe- of creatu g and regul it-
mg a cirrmcy ot equal value, crodi , and use,
wherever it naj cuculate , but does ht not hen
evident'y refer to the power " to c< m mmey, and
regulate the value t eieof 1" Is there any other
clause of the Constitution to which he eouid reie-i
He calculated much on the power of the Pank of
the Uni ed States " as an important auxihaiy" m
restoring tin-, constitutional currency and bank-
ing medeemable paper, but does he any where
suggest, or even intimate, that Congress possess
ihe geiier il power to ercate a papei currency ior
the counti y, as a means of regulating com ncrc ?
i his ¡s the point which ihe Stnatoi miu t ptove or
i, at put ol his argument wh ch resfs u, oti uilho-
nty must fall to the ground No, sir, ihe Senator
i mself is the lust individual, since the adoption
o the Constitution, who has asseited this proposi-
tion It is original with himself He his pro-
duced no authority to prove that any ot ihe Tather 
of the Constitution eve held such doctrine
The Seintor contends that a power to regulate
commerce, by implication, confers the power to
cieate a paper circulating medium by which corn-
il erce ca i be ron U cted Now, if I were even to
i m t this mil enc , contrary, m my opinion, both
to the Utter ind spun o! the Cons urn m, stnl the
r it emau would be fat (rom estab i liiiu his pro-
position And why? Because, when 11  Const tu
tion confeis an eipre s power, ind pioi ides, in
express terms, Ine mem" by which it >' -ill ' c ex
ere s~d, it would be a violation of evt-rv sound
rile of toiislruclton to call m the aid oí implica
ti n to create mother and a diffeient means or ac-
complishing the same end INow the C nstilu-
ton lias piovultd gold did silver c n, an 1 no
otiei cmreicv, is the medium l} «Inch com-
meice is to be c uducted, how, thei, cm t ie gen-
tleman ci"a e a papei currency by implic tion?
Congress hive ts ablished mm s to con hard
more) in execution o£ this power how, the i, can .
he establish papei min s lo manufac are paper
money ior the ver sime p upóse' Tousealiw
maxim, the expiess on ol tne one is the eichisi m
of the other If the framers ol the 6< imitation
i ad intended to comer such a poner, Ih y tnu'd
have added to the power "to com money ind rigu
law the value thereof,' that of issuing paper
moiej Now sir,can any person, at all acquai ít-
edwi'h the history of those times, bth ve that
such a proposition Mould hvc receivnl as,rg]e
vote m the Convention
Is there a word in the Enelisn langnrge which
¡¡as a more preeite signilcation than the word 're-
guíate?" Does it not necessanlv imply the pre-
vious existence of something to bergo'ited? In
ti i fcenst it has been used b} the frames of the
Con«' 11 ion themselves, in conferring the coining
poner Thev first give fhe poner ' to coin mo-
ney, ' and after money has thus been crea ed, then
they add the power to "regulate ' its value They
thus, clcarlj mark the distinction between the two
