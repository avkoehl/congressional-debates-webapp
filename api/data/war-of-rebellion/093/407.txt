intrench the commanding ground upon it, from which he could, in some measure, protect the right of Colonel Doolittle's brigade (which was refused) from assault on that flank. The enemy had been heard chopping during the whole night along the high conical hill in the re-entrant of our line and upon the ridges farther toward our right. At daylight the line of their works was apparent upon ground very considerably higher than that of Casement's and Doolittle's brigades, and early in the morning General Couch notified me that a heavy column of the enemy was passing partially in view across his front toward our right. The major-general commanding, who was on the ground when the information arrived, ordered that part of my line to be held tenaciously, whilst Stiles' brigade should be prepared to second the movement of dismounted cavalry toward the enemy's position from the Hillsborough pike, beyond my right flank. Lively artillery and skirmish fire was kept up during the day, and numerous efforts made by the enemy to dislodge Casement and Doolittle by pushing past their right along the high ridge leading to the Hillsborough pike.

The nature of the ground enabled us to baffle these attempts by throwing forward strong supports for the skirmish lines until about 4 p.m., when the cavalry on the extreme right having pushed past the enemy's left flank a general advance was ordered. I directed accordingly that Stiles' brigade should advance vigorously past the line of Doolittle's right upon the high wooded ridge, keeping pace with the dismounted cavalry beyond him and with Doolittle's brigade on his left. The latter was ordered to assault the salient on his front as soon as the conical hill in front of Major-General Smith's left should be carried, and Casement was ordered to move to the right and occupy Doolittle's works, supporting him and Stiles when they advanced. About 4.30 General Smith's line was seen to reach the summit of the conical hill, and Doolittle was ordered to charge. This he did in the most gallant manner, the Twelfth Kentucky Volunteers having the lead and charging the salient and battery in their front. The enemy was manifestly disconcerted. Their fire was too high, and did no injury to our troops as they scaled the rocky hill. Stiles was promptly up, and as the whole line went forward the enemy broke in confusion, making the best of their way across the hills toward the Franklin pike. Four guns (light 12's) were captured in the salient; four others were taken a little to the left in the depression of the hills. These last were subsequently claimed by McArthur's division, of Smith's command, but the evidence appended to the report of Colonel Doolittle leaves no doubt that they were fairly captured by his brigade. Between 200 and 300 prisoners were also taken. The line of our advance being perpendicular to the Granny White pike, and Major-General Smith's being along and parallel to it, we met his troops at the pike, and to avoid confusion I ordered the division to halt. The major-general commanding coming up immediately directed us to bivouac for the night, as the roads were occupied by other columns moving in pursuit. Doolittle's brigade remained on the ridge it had carried, overlooking the Granny White pike; Stiles was in bivouac on the next slope to the right, and Casement in reserve in the works erected by Doolittle's brigade on the preceding right.
