JYorth Star Woolen Mill.
Built in 1861. by Ua^tnian, Gibson & Co., proprie-
tors. (W. W. Eastman, Paris Gibson, and John De
Laittre.) A noble building, fifty by seventy-five
feet, four stories in height, and cost $70,000.
This mill was the first at the falls operated by a
power created by the fall of water through a perpen-
dicular artificial shaft, discharging through a sub-
terranean channel; a system which has since been
adopted in a number of instances with remarkable
results.

It is the interest, therefore, of the States of
Wisconsin, Iowa, Illinois, Kentucky, Missouri,
and all the States of that great valley, down
to the month of the Father of Waters that this
bill should pass. The people of those States
desire cheap lumber and cheap flour. It is
their interest that the vessels which navigate
that river should be able to sail right up to the
foot of its great water-power and receive their
freight from the very doors of the mills. The
vast, treeless, prairie region of Iowa. Illinois,
and part of Missouri are especially interested
. in every measure which will cheapen the cost
| of the lumber brought irom the pineries of
i Minnesota for their fences and houses.
The House will observe that this grant of
lands is confined to the State of Minnesota,
It is asked for by that State by its Legisla-
ture, by its people, by the cities c-f St. Paul,
Minneapolis, and St. Anthony, by the farmers
and lumber men of the State; and it is not in
conflict with the interests of the State of Min-
nesota in respect to settlement and develop-
ment. because the act expressly provides that
the land shall be held by the State, not bv any
company, and shall be sold by the State to
actual settlers at $1 25 per acre, and the pro-
ceeds of the sale paid for the improvement of
the river. This amount of land at that price
will yield just about the sura which, according
to General Warren, will be necessary to con-
struct that lock and dam.
Mr. MAYNARD, I would like to inquire
where this lock and dam is expected to be
located ?
Mr. DOHNELLY. In answer to tbat ques-
tion I will state that General G. K. Warren,
of the United States Army, under the direction
of the War Department, and in compliance
with an act passed by Congress, made a sur-
vey and examination of this portion of the
river, and his report is that by the construc-
tion of a lock and dam, giving a rise of water
of thirteen feet at Meeker's Island, between
the city of St. Paul and the Falls of St, An-
thony, eom-plete and perfect navigation can be
obtained, to the foot of the falls; and lie further
estimates that the construction of such a lock
and dam will cost $230,GG5t and he recom-
mends that such a work be constructed. The
following is an extract from his report on this
subject, and also the report of Frank Cook,
esq., civil engineer:
Navigation from, Falls of St. Anthony to Fort Snell-
tn£r.—Just above the Falls of St. Anthony [see sketch
No. 6] the water-power companies have constructed
a dam of timber and stone completely across the
river, and at lowest stages the entire water of tho
river is passed through the mill wheels, leaving the
crest of the old falls quite dry.
The top of tho dam is about thirteen feet higher
than that of tho rock forming the cresfcof the old
vertical fall, and the Mississippi is consequently
dammed back some miles, obliterating the rapids
there. This dam also retains the heavy sediment
brought down by the river, so that little passes it.
The crest of the old fall is formed of a hard mag-
nesian limestone about twelve feet thick. Under-
neath this is a very soft siliceous sand rock, which
extends down an unknown depth. It is easily worn
away by the water, leaving the hard rock unsup-
ported, This, then, breaks off. Quantities of it iio
m the bed below broken into fragments of all sizes,
from fifty to sixty feet square down to shingle and
sand. The largerpieces, not being transportable by
the water, have remained so as to fill up the bed and
extend the rapids below-. In the first two hundred
feet space below the old fall* the rapids descend
about eight feet over those broken rocks, and these
the Minneapolis Mill Company intend to partially
remo\ e, so as to increase tne perpendicular fall te
tliat amount. When this is done the whole available
mill-power will be due to a fall of about, thirty-fivo
feet, made up as follows: fifteen feet in dam abovo
falls, twelve feet old fall, and eight feet by clearing
away rocks at tho foot of the falls.
Much labor is being expended by the Water-Power
Company to develop the locations for mill sites, and
au extensive apron has been built below the old fall
to prevent the capping limestone from being furthei
undei mined.
In the first three fouiths of a mile below this the
stream falls about fifty feet. Up to the lower end
of this reach steamboats have come even in low
water. The current of the river below, however, is
very rapid, and large rocks obstruct the channel-
way. The fall at lowwater from the foot of the reach
last mentioned down to Meeker's Island, a distance
of two raile.s, is about thirteen feet. Alter consider-
ing all tho circumstances of tho case, the conclusion
was arrived at that a thorough improvement of this
last two-mile reach could only be made by dam and
lock, and that if a vessel could bo brought up this
far it would probably accommodate all the require-
ments of the present for both the cities of St. Anthony
and Minneapolis.
I employed Mr. Frank Cook, civil engineer at
Minneapolis, to make the necessary surveys, plans,
and estimates both tor locks and dams across the river,
and also for locks with side dams and excavations
along the shore. His report is herewith submitted.
He reports the cost of dam across Meeker's Island.
substantially built of stone and wood ....8126,606 17
Stone lock, 13 feet lift, 375 feet long, and 60
feet wide, with guard and lock-gates
complete  104,059 31
Total $230,665 48
The apprehension which I felt when I directed an
estimate for a side canal and lock, as to the difficulty
of securing permanency to the dam, I do not now
feel; so I recommend the plan estimated for as above.
The other project is notas good if accomplished, and
would cost, according to Mr. Cook's e>timate, $630,519.
It is understood that no charge will be mado by the
proprietors of the land overflowed by the dam.
No special appropriation is deemed called for at
this time for improving the channel below Meeker's
Island. The boats estimated for in a previous part
oi this report can do all that is required.
Mississippi River from St. Paulto Falls of St. Anthony
Minneapolis, Minnesota, December, 31,1868.
Sir : In pursuance of your directions I have made
a survey of the Mississippi river from the Falls of St.
Anthony to the foot of the rapids, at Meeker's island,
in section thirty-one. township twenty-nine, range
