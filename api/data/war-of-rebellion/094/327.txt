HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF EAST TENNESSEE AND FOURTH DIVISION, TWENTY-THIRD ARMY CORPS, Knoxville, Tenn., December 23, 1864.

Colonel C. G. HAWLEY,

First Ohio Heavy Artillery:

COLONEL: It is my intention to send your regiment some fifteen or twenty miles in front of Strawberry Plains, near the French Broad River, for the purpose of protecting the working party on the opposite side, &amp;c. You had better get your knapsacks, &c., so as to make your men comfortable, as the march will be short, and if rapid movement is required at any time the supplies can be left in camp, as it is not probable that more than two companies will be required at one time. Sixty rounds of cartridges ought to be taken. You will be able to subsist on the country to a great extent, wheat and corn being abundant and good mills convenient. You will please be ready to move as soon as practicable-say Monday or Tuesday. You will take about three day's rations with you of bread. Of coffee, sugar, salt, &c., you had better take at least ten or fifteen days. Beef you can drive along, or perhaps it may be procured in the country, but this is uncertain. I will advise you what to take in time. Please prepare to move, so far as clothing, ammunition, &c., is concerned.

Very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

J. AMMEN,

Brigadier-General.
