that we come as robbers and murderers of women and children. The general in command knows that every soldier desires to prove that we have been vilely slandered. To make the proof most signal the army will not halt in the town. We will march through in soldierly order, no man leaving the ranks or shouting or making any unnecessary noise. Let the conduct of the troops be in contrast to the profance and disorderly behavior of the rebel army, and the people will bless us as the restorers of safety and liberty of conscience and speech and the defenders of their property. This order will be read at the head of every company before entering the town of Charleston.
