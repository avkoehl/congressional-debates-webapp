SPRINGFIELD, MO., October 11, 1862.

Major General SAMUEL R. CURTIS:

My advance under General Brown drove the enemy from Pineville yesterday, without loss on our side. My forces are encamped a few miles south of Newtonia. I intended to move toward Cassville to-day, but heavy rains render it impossible. I shall open communication with Springfield by the Telegraph road as soon as the weather will permit. The enemy is concentrating at Pea Ridge, I believe not more than 15,000 strong.

Brigadier-General BLUNT,

Commanding Kansas Division:

You will please send one brigade of your division to Keetsville in the morning, starting not later than 7 o'clock, and concentrate the remainder of your division at your present position, leaving however a regiment of cavalry at Keetsville, as understood in our verbal arrangement this morning. I will move to Cassville to-morrow with General Totten's entire division. The officer in command of the brigade sent to Keetsville will be instructed to fall back toward Cassville if pressed by a superior force and send intelligence to you and to me. In such event you will move your entire command to Cassville. Have a strong scouting party sent out in advance of the brigade to go down the Fayetteville road as far as Pea Ridge, unless the enemy is met sooner, and to return and report to-morrow evening. Let the report be forwarded to you and to me immediately.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General HERRON:

I am informed by a letter from Colonel Philips, at Crane Creek, that you will be at that place to-day. I have heard nothing from you directly since my order for you to move. I have received no mail from two days. You will please move forward to Cassville as rapidly as you can without overtasking you men. You will leave four companies of Colonel McClurg's regiment at Crane Creek, under command of Major Eno, with instructions to scout the surrounding county, particularly east and southeast, and to furnish escorts for trains when necessary. All other troops at Crane Creek will move with you. I ordered a battery, of Captain Backof's, I presume, which was en route from Rolla, to join you, which I hope it has done before now. I will be at Cassville by 12 o'clock to-morrow, and will defer a general advance for you to come up. Answer me at Cassville, and let me know when 1 may expect you.

Very respectfully,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Brigadier-General.
