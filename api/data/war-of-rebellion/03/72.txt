HDQRS. BATTALION FIRST INFANTRY,August 16, 1861.

SIR: I have the honor to make the following report of the operations of my command on the 10th of this month:

This was observed by the enemy, and a large force was accumulated in our front and on our left flank, and our forward progress was checked. Nevertheless, the men stood steadily and squarely up to their work, until I deemed our position no longer tenable, and I then drew off my command, steadily and without confusion, in the direction of Totten's battery, the key of our position. In this field I had many men killed and wounded. Lieutenant Wood and myself are among the latter. We were materially aided in extricating ourselves by the timely aid of Du Bois' battery, which beat back the advance of the enemy with much slaughter. On arriving at the foot of the hill, and in rear of Totten's battery, I formed the battalion and relinquished the command to Captain Huston, being no longer able
