APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GL0ÉE.

&6th Cong"-2nd Skss.
Pre emption Law—Mr. Benton.
Senate
the Senate to recapitulate at any length an argu-
ment which has been so ably maintained, and is so
familiar to the country. As to that portion of our
territory ceded by the old Stales, it cannot be denied
that Congress holds it in trust, m trust for all the
States, old and new, and not for the people of the
State? In this respect the proceeds of the land
are different from ordinary revenues which are col-
lected from tha people, and for their benefit, and not
for the use of the States The States are then part-
ners m this great land fund, and Congress the trustee
There is no prmciplem law or ethics which prevents a
a trustee (rom surrendering at pleasure a trust, and
into whose hands can he make the sunender but
those of the cestui que trust, the beneficiary of the
trast? And here this argument end , and conclu-
sively. For if, according to the very terms of the
deeds of cession, this be a trust for the u«e of ihe
States, it must of nece>stty be in theu several and
corpora e c ipacity. The contrary idea cannot be
found in our system It was the States who sui-
lendered to the Federal Government all the powers
contained in our Corstituuon—the most of the e
powers in their exercise operate upon the people < f
the United States, and the duties of the Govern-
ment enure to iheir benefit, but here is an excep-
tion m the vsry terms of the charter I cannot,
under oar Constitution, conceive the idea which has
been expressed by the learned Senator fiom South
Carolina, [Mr Cilhoun] of Stales in their ag-
giegate capacity, Icinm the r Federal opacity,
and if in this capacity they were intended to ho'd
their interest in the lands, the deeds wou'd have ex-
pressed the tenure to be for the benefit of the "Un iied
States" and not " for the use and benefit of such of
of the United States as have become, and shall be-
come members of the Confederation or Federal
alliance of the said States, Firgimu inclusive, ac-
crding to their usual respective proportions," &c.
Then came the Constitution providing that "the
Congress shall have power to dispose of and make
all needful rules and regulations respecting the trr
rnory or other property belonging to the Unit d
State!!,' opeiat ng witnout qualification orconlmon
upon terntery subsequently acquired, and upon tae
lands previously acquired, subject to the truUs
contained in the deed ol cession No piopri tor
can be \ested with a more absolute mis ery over
his own estate, and the only limit to th" powers or
the Rational Legislature in this re~pect, is that con-
scientious obligation which binds it, in the perform-
ance of all its duties, to consult the welfare oPÉie
people and the Stales
Many powers have been exercised  Ly  Congres
wheh the Constitunon his not deli gated m terns
For example, Congress have made inve*menu m
State stocks—they have remitted dmiis to ia lroad
companies and other associations, to supply which
other classes must be taxed—they h?ve given  fire
per cent, of the lands to the new States find grams
of land—they ha/e granted pensions and bounties
to individuals—they have purchwd temtoiy be
votld the limits of  the treaty of 1783, and formed
out of it confederte Stales, and tney have made
scientific explotaliom.   Not one of these but u of
more equivocal authority than the cess o i of th..
proceeds of the lands to all the States
The Senator from Missouri [Air Efnton] is in-
dignant at a proportion whi h ho sa>s is to with
draw four millions of annual revenue to be sup
plied by additional dunes upen impoits If ube
such an outrage to diveitthis four millioi s, (ihe
annual proceeds of the lands,) from our exchequer,
into the treasuries of the several S ate', how much
more severely do wt v. ound the Constitution if we
annihilate these proceed > altogeihvr, and diy tp
this source of levóme? And vet ir, Hie la(e Pre-
sident has made ihi  very recommendation In
his annual messag  of Dtccmlei, 1832 General
Jackson siy  ' It seem  to me to ce cur true policy
th,at the public lands shall cease as soon as practi-
cable to be a souice of revenue ' d id he proceeds
to recommend such a di p bit on of thxm ,i shall
barely reimburse expenses Th s wa the very
session after the land bill had been first in reduced,
and had passed this bod}, and jet the Senator from
M s oun now condemns it as an affirmance of the
very principle sustained by General Jackson
For myself, sir, I subscribe to the doctrine that
the lands ought pot to be a source of ordinary Fe-
deral revenue In their management, so many
questions of State policy, of jarring interests, and
of patriotic accommodation are mingled, that they
furnish too uncertain a reliance; and ihe compe-
tency of this Government to realize from imposts
all that is necessary for its «-conomical administra-
tion, blended with high interests so immediately
connected with the system of impost duties, plainly
indicate another and a better direction for the land
fund
1 hat direction, sir, is given in the amendment
under consideration, and it u demanded by a force
and demonstration of authority which Ihe people
have rarely exerted upon their legislative func-
tion?nes. We cannot, if we would, shut our eyes
to the condition of the Slates , Laboring under
mountains of debt, I will not say that the burden
of mlerest will, in a year or two, become msup
portable, and that their faith will be dishonored,
b'ciuse I beheve ihey will sustain their honor at
any sacrifice My own State (Indiana) is laigely
a debtor State, but during the suspension of 1837
she was one of only two States, I believe, in the
Union who met her engagements in specie, and
she will continue to do so But a few days ago I
saw a notice from her Fund Commissioner, of his
readiness to pay her present Januaiy instalment of
interest
friere Mr Clay of Kentucky inquired whether
the S ate of Indiana had resorted to new loans for
the payment of interest ]
Mr White proceeded Indiani has not piled
Pelionupon Ossa She may, for the lime, have
appropnatedsome domestic funds for lhat pnipose,
and has been aided by her bank.
But what will be the condition of the States when
their vast amount of principal falls due from 1845
to 18G5' A worse blight cmnot fall upon the
prosp-nty of the States than i large and perma-
nent debt Our policy in that respect is essentially
diflerent from that of England We could not
survive such a debt as ihe British nation owes to its
own subijc s The debt of Great Britain is equiva-
lent, for the purposes of sustaining population, to
an entailment of her empire Men live upon
stocks there as they live upon land here It is the
garnered and the hoarded wealth of ages deposited
with the Government, and the income of the own-
ers is guarantied by the industry of her millions of
ortificers, whose laboratories are the workshops of
ihe world, and by Ihe taxes which she draws from
Ihe commerce of all nations In this country, ca-
pí tsl finds other and better employment in the im-
provement of the land While England was an
agricultural countiy, she had no public debt. Af-
tor the balance of power had been adjusted ¡n Eu-
rope, and the commercial era commenced, the Bri-
tish debt wat contráete I. Expensive wars and the
eUabli^hment of a colonial system have been ne-
cessary to maintain that commerce, and her debt
has be n rapidly accumulating So soon as she
shall have established her commerce beyond the
competition of the world, there will be an end of
her debt Until our territory becomes too tnickly
p pulated to sustain the inhabitants, a public debt
will prove a national calamity.
Now, sir, it is m the power of this Government,
withojt in the least impover shmg itself or tran-
s-ending lis proper sphere of action, to allot this
rich domain of a thousand millions of acres to the
S ates, and thus to relieve our people fiom intermi-
nable and headitary taxes. Shall we abuse, by
vile inaction, this capacity to do good, and incur
the execration of our constituents1 Is ¡his confe-
derated Government a mere machine to run in an
endless circle of inanity? Are we forever to be set-
tling first principles which, like the blighted flowers
of ea ly spring, shall yield no fruit? Bss the Con-
stitution no vitality, and is our theory of govern-
m nt a mere abstraction? in ordinary times, sir,
we may s¡t h<re in cold deliosration, aoiding to the
people the doc nne "lhat they expect too much
from the Government," and escape under that ge-
nerous forbearance which accompanies a state of
prosperity, but in such an exigency as the present,
oiher in 1 sterner duties invite us to action. Saltts
popuh suprema lex, and let him abide the conse-
quences who will not come to the rescue.   What is
onr Union, when the States are ruined—our Confe-
deration, when its links are broken? Strike rut
the stars from our national banner, and it is no-
thing but a piece of bunting S r, the distribution
policy wi 1 control the next Presidential election
No, I mistake. Before that time, under different
counsels, and another Administration, this measure
of safety and of beneficence will have passed, the
flag of the Union will no longer prove a barren
sceptre, and ihe triumphs of the Constitution will
have been proclaimed
Senators have chosen, in the progress of tus de
bale, to deride the principles upon which that Ad-
ministration has bsen brought into power Tney
mistake the type for the event, and suppose that a
phrenzied majority will erect a log cabin upon th
rums of the Capitol We rejoice, not, sir, that the
logcabm has been brought to Washington, but
that power has been transferred to the log cabin—
that the Capitol has been removed to the country—
that tbe people have ex rcised that residuary sove-
reignty which was always their own, and which
heretofore has been suffered only to sleep—that,
however the "divine rijhi" of rule may instal itself
in the Tuillenes, in Buckingham Palace, or ¡n the
Kremlin, m this country its appropriate residence is
in tbe thatched cottage of the American citizen.
Let gentlemen cavil at the watchwords of freemen '
' Tippecanoe" is now another name for liberty, and
henceforward, in every struggle for human right ,
and every contest between the ruler and the ruled,
to the hopes of the patriot deliverance shall come
from the wilderness, and the star of the West is the
sign by which he shall conquer
Montesquieu says that "the fine system of Bri-
tish Government was invented in the woods "
For the first time in our history, the territory North
west of the Ohio river has given a President to
tie Unnn—one connected with all ihe labors, with
all the experience,wnh all the glories of our mighty
provincial settlements It would be slrange if,
undir his administration, that social and political
development which he so hippily began m the val-
ley of ihe Mississippi should not be urged onward
until lhat great region has reached the destiny for
which the Almighty desianed it—part and parcel
with the Atlantic States of one great confederated
err pire—borrowing from the old 'Thirteen" the
glorie? of the Revolutionary era, the last great
drama of which was ac ed West of the mountains,
and importing to the mother States, through every
vicissitude of theu future history, that vtgsr and
purity which we trust shall forever reside in the
peaceful agricultural valleys of the West
SPEECH OF MR. BEN/TON,
OF MISSOURI,
In Senate, Thursday, January 22, 1841—In reply to
Mr We6>ter.'s remarks on the Pre-emption bil1.
Mr BENTON said he had listened attentively
to the argument of the Senator from Massachu-
setts [Mr Webster] in favor of the constitutional
power of Congress to pass the land revenue distri-
bution bilf, now so unseasonably, and so per e-
venngly pressed upon the attention of the Senate.
He had listened te it attentively, and in hearing all
the argument which that Senator had delivered,
condensed, and concentrated as it was, he believed
he had heard all that could be said on that point
It was the sum and substance of all that he had
heard before, either in this chamber, or oat of it.
And what was it1 Nothing more nor less than a
reference of our power to the deeds of cess'on,
and a derivation of our whole right to make this
distribution, from the terms and conditions of these
deeds. He does not pretend to derive a particle of
power to pass this bill except from those deeds-
he refers to nothing else Now, sir, what are the
deeds, and what is the bill? What does cne grant,
and the other cover' The deeds are limited to the
original boundaries of the United States—the Mis-
sis-ippi on the west, and the parallel of 31 degrees
on the south, the bill extends to the Paeific ocean
west and to ihe Gulf of Mexico south' Such is the
difference—the wide difference—between them. If
the argument of the Senator from Massachusetts
was valid as far as it went, (which in fact it is
not,) it would not answer his purpose, it would
