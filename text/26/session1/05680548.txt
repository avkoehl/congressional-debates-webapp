CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Mr. CHAFMAN of Iowa protested against that
motion, and complained that the mover had not
acted honorably in making the motion before the
bills were acted on.
The question was pat on the motion, and agreed
to; and the committee rose and reported the bills to
the House.
The question being on concurring with the
amendment of the committee, striking out the en-
acting clause of the bill authorizing the President
of the United States to cause the lead mines to be
sold, the question was put, and the amendment was
concurred in.
Mr. CHAPMAN made some remarks in oppo-
sition to the amendment before the question was
pat.
Senate bill (320, as noticed above,) which was
reported from the committee, was then read the
third time and passed; but the joint rule was not
suspended which prohibited its presentation to the
President for his signature, and the bill was in con-
sequence lost, notwithstanding it passed both
Houses.
The bill appropriating $55,000 for the protection
of commerce on Lake Michigan, [by the construc-
tion of harbors on that portion of the lake border-
ing on Wiskonsin,] came up on its engrossment for
a third reading.
Mr. TURKEY demanded the yeas and nays on
that question; which, having been ordered, were—
yeas 70, nays 55.
The bill was then read the third time, and the
question being, "Sha'l the bill pass?"
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi spoke of the
profession of economy of the Whig party, the
most of whom belonging to it had just voted in
favor of this enormous measure, lie hoped it
would not pass.
Mr. MARVIN moved the previous question on
its passage; which, having received a second, and
the question being, "Shall the main question be
new put?"
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi demanded the
yeas and nays; which, having been ordered, were
—yeas 70, nays 70. The Speaker vo'ed in the
negative, and the House determined that the
main question on its passage should not be put.
The hour of two o'clock, the time fixed by the
joint resolution for the closing of the present session
having expired before the roll was called throngh
on the question above,
The SPEAKER announced that the House was
adjourned till the first Monday in December next.
