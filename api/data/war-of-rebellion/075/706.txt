ROME, GA., Friday Evening, May 13, 1864.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding:

There has been hard fighting all day at Resaca, and General Polk has telegraphed to direct you to push forward your command as rapidly as possible. We have not had the particulars of the battle to-day, but from the reports of the artillery heard here the firing must have been very heavy. On receipt of this you will please forward by couriers or stage coach the day and hour which your different brigades expect to be here, so that I can arrange for their transportation.

Very respectfully,

WEST STEEVER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Acting Assistant Inspector-General.

CALHOUN, GA., May 13, 1864.

Major D. WEST,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH GEORGIA CAVALRY,May 13, 1864.

The enemy occupied the bridge on opposite side of the river, and seem to be planting a battery in a position which will command my line on the river. Should they do this I will be able to hold but a small portion of the river around for a considerable distance. If we had artillery here they might be driven from their position probably.

J. R. HART,

Colonel.
