Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to state that the signal officer with the Fifth Corps has condensed the following from the reports from the stations in front of that corps:

The enemy's line of breast-works along the Duncan road, near J. Boisseau's house, has been abandoned, the men in it moving forward about 250 yards to a new line on the right of a heavy work in front of that house, moving the abatis from the old line to front of new one. The enemy's picket-line near the Fisher house was relieved at 5 p. m. by a force of 150 men, and each post has six men in it. The usual number of wagons and horsemen passing on Boydton plank road. Unusually quiet in all the enemy's camps on this front to-day.
