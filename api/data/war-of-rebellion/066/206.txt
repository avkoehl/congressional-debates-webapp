Lieutenant Colonel JAMES F. HALL,

Provost-Marshal-General, Dept. of the South:

SIR: I send on shore contrabands heretofore serving in the squadron and now discharged. If they return to their ship in a week I wish to reship them. Will you please give them passes for a week, and allow them to return to us should they desire to do so? I will be obliged if you, will apprise General Foster that these contrabands have been landed.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Naval Depot.

Respectfully forwarded to the commanding general.

If these men are allowed to come on shore, I wish it may either be as discharged men or as men on furlough. To have them sent with the condition that if they do not return on board at a certain time they will be liable to be taken by the Army is not agreeable to this branch of the service.

Commanding Department of the South:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I am sufficiently advanced in the matter of the mines to be able to apply them within two or three days.

These I am about to use to destroy the boom.

It appears to me that looking at Sumter a considerable breach has been made in the two faces of the fort, especially the left face. I propose sending a party around the fort with the view of ascertaining the amount of damage done to these walls. The work on the Swamp Angel will soon be finished. I have been moving my headquarters to Morris Island, and have been prevented on that account from making out a report of the attack on Fort Johnson.
