SIR: I have the honor of submitting the following report of a scout, beginning on the 1st day of and ending on the 4th day of October, 1864, which resulted as follows:

I took Hardin and Gentry with a skiff and proceeded up the river (on the mail-boat Diligence) as far as Doctor Peters', at the foot of Council Bend. Got in the skiff at 11 p. m. the same night and landed on the Arkansas shore. Proceeded to Doctor Peter's house, captured a man there by the name of W. D. Freeman. At daylight, the 2nd, crossed over to the Mississippi shore and captured William C. Tannahill (with a revolver). Said Tannahill was regularly detailed to ferry Confederate soldiers by order of General Price. Came back to the Arkansas shore and proceeded to Alligator Bayou, on the Saint Francis River, and proceeded up the river five miles, and came back to Alligator; staid all night. At daylight, the 3rd of October, we started back to Doctor Peters; arrived there at 12 m. I took a bond of $1,000 for the appearance of W. D. Freeman, at Helena within ten days, with Doctor Peters as security. At 1 o'clock starter down the river for Helena; came twenty miles, staid all night; started at 6 a. m. the 4th; came down ten miles to Berry's, in Walnut Bend, and captured B. A. Berry and H. A. D. Waddell. Berry had been a prisoner, but escaped by jumping off a boat. Waddell is a private of the First Tennessee Infantry. Arrived at Helena at 5 p. m. the 4th October, 1864.
