General Gregg was directed to send Spear's brigade to your division on the railroad, instead of the regiment of cavalry with it this morning. General Gregg's instructions of 10 a.m. have just been modified. He is now directed to concentrate his division at Reams' Station and hold that point and picket to Warren's left and also to your division,destroying the railroad. General Miles need not therefore leave any force to hold Reams' Station. Colonel Spear's brigade will continue with Miles.
