HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, September 15, 1864-7.30 p.m. (Received 7.40 p.m.)

General GRIFFIN:

I have detailed the garrisons for the forts from Baxter's brigade, so that you and General Ayres can have all of your divisions if we have to move. I wish you would move your troops from around the fort so that I can abatis it all around. You can move these troops to advantage to the left of the railroad into the breast-works facing southeast, where [we] should need men if the enemy makes an attack from the south.

Respectfully,G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
