ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

General Jones telegraphed yesterday that Colonel C. escaped from hospital, had been recaptured, and the order carried into execution.

By order of Secretary of War:

R. G. H. KEAN,

Chief Bureau of War.
HDQRS. DIST. OF BATON ROUGE AND PORT HUDSON,Baton Rouge, La., August 23, 1864.

Colonel C. C. DWIGHT,

Commissioner of Exchange of Prisoners, &amp;c.:

I inclose you herein the rolls of prisoners exchanged on 22nd instant by Colonel Landram, of our forces, and Colonel Scott, C. S. Army. *

As you will see, Colonel Landram became indebted to them four men, for which he gave a receipt, a copy of which is inclosed. He also accepted the paroles of four of our men; three of these were at time of capture too sick to move and were paroled and left; the other was paroled to remain and take care of them. Colonel Landram accepted an exchange for these men, he not being aware it was contrary to orders. Should you so desire not to recognize these paroles it would be well to address a letter to Colonel Scott, advising him of the fact and that the receipt given by Colonel Landram is so canceled.

I am, very truly, your obedient servant,

F. J. HERRON,

Major-General.
