1 dead in the hack, and the driver was wounded, and other 2 cut the harness and left. But 1 of them was shot from the horse, but it was in the edge of the timber. They found the horse, but it was so dark they could not find the man. they will look for him this morning. I am going into the rebel portion of the country where these men sprung up from so suddenly. I will report when I come in from my trip.

BROOKFIELD, June 20, 1864.

GENERAL: I had my whole force out yesterday after those bushwhackers. Lieutenant Lewis, with 40 men, is now after them. They came into Laclede about 5 o'clock in the afternoon and took the town. I think they had at least 50 or 60 prisoners while in town. They then went into the stores of some men and took all the money they could get and what other things they could conveniently carry off. I have the amount, or nearly so; shall have the exact account of all goods, &amp;c., taken sworn to by each of the losers, and shall be ready to make the assessment on their sympathizing friends who feed and harbor them. This will stop bushwhacking. Shall i go ahead with the assessment? I will make full statement to you of loses, and also of assessments, giving the names of all the victims.

We captured 3 horses from the bushwhackers. One of them we killed was a brother of the man who killed Brock; the other was a bad egg by name of Callahan. I have the names of more of them who were in the gang; they line in this and Chariton Counties. We shot the face most off one who got away. he will not live.

BROOKFIELD, June 20, 1864.

GENERAL: Lieutenant Lewis with his men were heard from this morning, still running the bushwhackers; he run into their camp last night and routed them. They had a log house for rendezvous, with bacon and other stores for living, in a place near the forks of Yellow Creek and Grand River. Lieutenant Lewis burned the establishment, provisions, and other plunder, and arrested 2 or 3 men who used to be bushwhacking in 1861, but have since taken the oath. One says he was with the bushwhackers and helped to bushwhack a company of the Seventh Missouri Cavalry at Hurricane Creek, Carroll County, in 1861. They had any amount of bacon and meat and bread, some corn, which had been furnished by somebody. He could not find anybody who had been furnishing either forcibly or voluntarily. Lieutenant Lewis sent the prisoners back and he is still running them south.
