Total.-; 
The best informed Republicans estimate (he
actual numberat about double the ascertained
cases, and when we consider the difficulty and
danger of a thorough investigation where the
sufferers are dead, or banished, or in fear and
peril ot their lives, it in not unreasonable to
suppose that "the half has not been told.'1 jf
Lhe committee had followed the; example of the
critical geutleman from Indiana wc should have
had between one and two thousand cases of
Jelony to try, and he would have made as many
MrFiuland trials of them.
The gentleman's exceeding technicality is
exhibited in what he says about the assassina-
tion of Judge Chase and the sheriff, Colonel
j\>pp, in vSi. Mary pariah. The testimoiry
shows that os a witness came out the house
where the judge and sheriff wore he met at the
door and passed through a band of Seymour
Knights, about a hundred strong, who had
mHcri^inio town and dismounted ; some were
in tho hall of the house; he passed through
tiic :n and when lie had gonefifly yards he heard |
tno firing which killed the judge and the sheriff, i

"To Mr. Kekr.
" I have lived in Louisianaabout twenty years off

Pope and Judge Chase.
"Answer. As to that I do not know. I had been

allowed to livo there. I heard no particular reason
given for tho assassination, cxcept that they wero
Republicans.

assignod—by Democrats, or by colored men?
"Ansioer. By Democrats. I know one of ihem.but

"Afmeer. They had on red shirts and carried torch-
lights. It was in tho mght-time. They had been
somewhere in the parish. I understood that when
they came buck to tho town they dismounted. They
eamomto the town on horseback."
The Democratic account,
" Assassin 4.tm)—Last Saturday, at night, about
half past eight o'clock, Henry Pope, Kadical &henff
ol this parish, and Valentine Chase, Radical parish
j tidge, wero assassinated at O'Ncil's hotel by parties
unknown.
" Wo wero in Smith's store, corner of Odd Fellows'
Hall,when tho first reports of the pistols were heard.
Walking rapidly toward the hotel, we halted infiont
of iloaly's coffee-house, when the last shots were
fired, ten or litteen in all. Twelvo or fourteen per-
sons had rushed out ol'-tho coffee-house at the first
alarm, and wero listening to the tiring.
"As soon as tho (ii ing was over there was a solemn
pause in the crowd and at ound the hotel. Inquiries
ran rapidly from man to man in regard the cause of
the shooting and who was shot, and all present ap-
peared to be profoundly ignorant ot the nature ot
tho difficulty, and so many shots were fixed that tho
idea suggested itself that it was a serious fight !>«*-
tweonpartiesatthe hotel. Several parties cautiously
proceeded to O'Neil's front gallery to inquire about
tho cause and results of the tiring, but could learn
nothing there, as all in tho house were attracted
toward the rear, whore tho Jiring oceitrjcd, and
those who went to inquire returned to Ilealy's, not
knowing but that it might bo a light instead of an
assassination, and that the trouble might not yet bo
over. In fact so many shots were fired that it justi-
iicd tho belief that it w:is a light.
" In ash or t time, however, the news camc that Mr.
Pope, tho Radical shcrifi, was shot and killed, and
that tho asa.isMiiA, being thorough'}* disguised, hail
made their escape. As soon as the firing commenced
all in the hotel tied to their rooms for safety and to
got out of the way of danger, which gave the assas-
sins amplo leisure for escape. Mrs. Popo had just
stepped to Mr-*. O'Neil's room as tho firing com-
menced. Mr. U'Noil was in the room at the time
attending on his wife, who was sick. Upon the first
roport ot' I he pistols on the g,tiicry, near by. Mr.
O'Neil closcd his room door to protect his wife and
children and Mrs. Popo from harm, not knowing tho
cau-eof tho firing.
"Mr. Pope wagon tho gallery when the firing com-
menced, and quickly retreated to his room, where
the r-hooting stopped, and where he expired.
"Wc saw nothing of the as^as^ins cxcept one, who
pas^od by tho crowd in front of Ilealy's with a six-
shooter in his hand, so thoroughly diguised that no
porson eould possibly reeogniao him. IIo was about
of medium height and size. It is reported that those
engaged in the homicide mounted hordes near the
court-house and galloped down the road.
"A loyal league club was holding its weekly meet-
ing at tho negro church at the time the shooting was
heard, but the members quickly retired to their
homes when they heard the melancholy news of tho
tragedy.
"A strong police was immediately organized, and
tho town and vicinity wero amply protected against
disorder during tho night.
"Alter midnight the patrol stumbled over wlvit
appeared to be a dead man, between the hotel and
the bayou. A physician was called, and it proved
to be the body of Valentine Chaso, Radical parish
judge; and upon examination life was found to bo
extinct. A guard was put o\ or the body till morn-
ing, when a coroner's inquest was hold over the two
bodies; but no traces could be discovered in regard
to the perpetrators of the two assassinations.
"There is somo speculation in tho community in
regard to who committed the homicides, but it thns
far has been idle speculation. They have guessed
