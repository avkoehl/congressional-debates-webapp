IN THE FIELD,

Dallas, Ga., May 27, 1864- 4 p. m.

We have forced the enemy back to his breast- works throughout nearly the whole extent of his lines and find him occupying a strong position extending apparently from the north Marietta, or New Hope Church, road, to across the Villa Rica road. Our lines are up within clos e musket- range in many places, and the enemy appear to be massing on our right. I cannot well work toward the left; certainly not until I get trains and everything out of the way, for as soon as we uncover this flank (the right), the enemy will be on it.

Very respectfully, uour obedient servant,

DALLAS, GA., May 28, 1864- 6.25 p. m.

The enemy attacked us in force at 4.45 p. m. along the whole extent of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Corps, and was handsomely repulsed, with heavy loss on his side and considerable on ours. We are now bringing in prisoners and wounded. Unless an imperative necessity demands it, I do not see how I can move to - night; besides, the effect on our men will be bad.

Smith's divisiom, and Generla Schofield sent in a brigade on Dodge's left to try and communicate with Hooker. As soon as the troops were over and in position, I directed Dodge to strengthen his skirmish line, so as to meke it almost equivalent to a line of battle, expecially over was gallantly executed, the works taken, and some 50 prisoners captured; our loss not heavy; Colonel Noyes, Thirty- ninth
