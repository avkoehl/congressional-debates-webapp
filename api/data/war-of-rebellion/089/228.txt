HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 14, 1864. (Received 9 a.m.)

General WILLIAMS:

There has been no change in my lines since last report. It is said that the enemy are constructing a new work opposite Fort McGilvery. Some new dirt has been thrown up there, but not enough to determine the nature of the work. The fraise for the second line between Hare house and Fort McGilvery is being constructed, and the line will be ready to occupy as soon as the fraise is done.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,October 14, 1864-12 m. (Sent 12. 10 p.m.)

Major-General HANCOCK:

I desire you should place any force you may have on the Jerusalem plank road in Forts Stevenson and Blaisdell, with instructions to assist the engineer troops in completing these works and afterward keeping them in good condition. The presence of the cavalry on that road will relieve your infantry of much picketing, and should the cavalry be withdrawn, which they would be in case of movement of the enemy's cavalry, the occupation of these works with a few guns, if you can spare them, would secure the plank road from being used by the enemy.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,October 14, 1864-12.55 p.m.

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding:

I have ordered garrisons to Forts Stevenson and Blaisdell. I have no artillery. The section I had in reserve I put in the second line in rear of Fort Sedgwick last night. I have a section in Fort Bross. My reserves on the plank road are exhausted, but I still have one at Fort Hays.
