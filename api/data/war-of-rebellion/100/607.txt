WILMINGTON, May 31, 1865-3. 10 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel J. A. CAMPBELL,

Raleigh, N. C.:

Dispatch received concerning mustered-out men. New York papers of the 27th say the ram Stonewall surrendered to the Spanish authorities at Havana May 20. I beg permission to continue to feed a portion of the destitute white refugees; otherwise they will surely die. The order to stop the rations has had the effect to reduce the number of applicants materially. The citizens are endeavoring to organize aid but there will be more than they can do. The colonies of blacks also must be fed until they can be removed. Nearly 2,000 belong in South Carolina and Georgia, and await transportation. Large numbers of blacks have been scattered.
