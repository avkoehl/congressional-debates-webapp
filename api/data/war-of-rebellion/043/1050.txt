WAITING AT THIS PLACE DURING TEN MINUTES FOR THE TWO SQUADRONS ON MY RIGHT AND LEFT TO MAKE THEIR JUNCTION WITH ME; THEN I PROCEEDED FROM JEFFERSON TO RIXEYVILLE, SENDING A SMALL PARTY TO CAPTURE THE ENEMY'S PICKETS, HAVING BEEN INFORMED THAT THE ENEMY WERE PICKETING AESTHAM RIVER. I SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING 2 OF THEM. CROSSING ALL THE FORDS WITH OPPOSITION, I ARRIVED AT MUDDY RUN WITH MY COMMAND. I FORMED A LINE OF BATTLE, CONCEALING MY OWN FORCES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. DURING THIS TIME THE FIRST MASSACHUSETTS CAVALRY WAS SENT TO MAKE A DEMONSTRATION ON CULPEPER IN ORDER TO OBLIGE THE ENEMY TO COME OUT. THIS REGIMENT WENT TO WITHIN 4 MILES OF THE TOWN WITHOUT MEETING ANY FORCE OF THE ENEMY. AS IT WAS LATE IN THE EVENING AND MY HORSES TIRED, I WAS OBLIGED TO RETURN TO CAMP, DIVIDING MY FORCES IN FOUR COLUMNS, ONE TO CROSS AT FREEMAN'S FORD, ONE AT FOX'S FORD, ONE AT THOMPSON'S FORD, AND THE OTHER AT SULPHUR SPRINGS, WHERE FOUR PIECES OF ARTILLERY WERE LEFT TO PROTECT MY RECROSSING IN CASE OF A RETREAT. THE ENEMY DID NOT FOLLOW. DURING THIS RECONNAISSANCE I HAVE RECEIVED THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION: THERE IS NO ENEMY AT ALL BETWEEN SULPHUR SPRINGS AND AESTHAM RIVER, WHICH WAS ASCERTAINED BY MY RECONNAISSANCE. THE ENEMY IS PICKETING AESTHAM RIVER. HIS PICKETS DO NOT ALLOW ANY CITIZENS TO CROSS, MOTIVE FOR WHICH I COULD NOT ASCERTAIN. THERE WERE TWO BRIGADES OF CAVALRY AT CULPEPER, COMMANDED BY FITZHUGH AND W. H. F. LEE. THEIR REGIMENTS ARE VERY WEAK. THERE IS ALSO AT CULPEPER TWO COMPANIES OF INFANTRY, AND THE GENERAL IDEA IS THAT THE TROOPS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE IN THE SHENANDOAH VALLEY. THE BRIGADE OF FITZHUGH LEE IS COMPOSED AS FOLLOWS: FIRST, SECOND, THIRD, AND FIFTH VIRGINIA CAVALRY. JONES' BRIGADE IS IN THE VALLEY AT HARRISONBURG, THE SIXTH, SEVENTH, ELEVENTH, AND TWELFTH VIRGINIA CAVALRY, WITH 400 INFANTRY.

CAPTURES: 2 PRISONERS, 4 HORSES.

NO LOSS IN THE DIVISION.

VERY RESPECTFULLY,

A. N. DUFFIE,

COLONEL, COMMANDING SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION.

FINDING THE ENEMY COMING DOWN IN A PRETTY STRONG FORCE FROM THE WOODS ABOVE ALLUDED TO,
