1867.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
187
On the 4th of April, 1867, instructions were
given by the Attorney General "to suspend
all proceedings against C. C. Clay and not to
make the arrest,'' and to dismiss all indict-
ments for treason pending in [Maryland]
based on acts committed by parties acting^ in
a military capacity duriug the war.'' (Evi-
dence, 449.)
And this policy has prevailed generally. |
(Evidence 510, 612, 549.)
This refusal to execute the laws cannot plead
its early excuse that trials were impracticable, i
for the" district attorney of Virginia testified 1
that— j
" There never has been any difficulty since I haTe I
been district attorney 'July 1, 18tU) in getting an j
impartial loyal jury in Virginia that would eonvict !
men apain?{ whom there was sufficient evidence of
treason."—Evidence ot)9, Ho**e Report 104, first session

Underwood, and Evarts.
If the President may execute the laws or not
at his pleasure, then the law-making power is
a practical nullity.
I pass over without comment the suspension
for a time of the execution of the laws for the
collection of taxes and of sales under the direct
tax law in the rebel States. (Annual Report

ted States Statutes, 284,422,640; 13 Statutes,

surrender and sale of government property.
The act of Congress of January 31, 1862,
authorized the President to take military pos-
session of railroads and rolling stock, ana to
use, extend, and repair them.
During the rebellion the Government seized
railroads, including one at least constructed by
the rebel confederacy, and expended on them
for labor and materials $42,4(12,142 55, besides
the work performed by soldiers. (Evidence,
152, 291 ; House Executive Document 1, first
session Thirty-Ninth Congress; Report of
General McCollum ; Appendix to Report of
Secretary of War, p. 38.) The Government
built at the suggestion of Andrew Johnson,
then military governor of Tennessee, many
miles of the Nashville and Northwestern rail-
road, expending thereon $1,409,733 20, besides
the labor of soldiers. (Evidence, 160,192,209,
213, 232, 1125, 1142, 163, 177, 498, 173 ; Mc-
Collum Report, 23.)
Upon the Nashville and Chattanooga rail-
road the Government expended $4,079,511 33.
(Evidence, 1130-634.)
By capture in war the railroads constructed
by the rebel government became the property
of the United States. (Evidence, 550, &c.)
By virtue of the President's orders of Au-
gust 8 and October 14, 1865, the railroads held
by military authority of the United States in
the insurrectionary States were " turned over"
"to the owners,"' who had been generally
rebels. (Evidence, 186, 203.)
This was unauthorized by any statute. Its
purpose and effect were to surrender property
which had cost the Government many mil-
lions, and it was contrary to the opinion of the
Quartermaster General of August 9, 1864, who,
in relation to the two Tennessee roads to which
I have referred, said:
" I am of the opinion that the United States should
retain possession of both roads." * * * *
"The interests in these roads not settled by legal
proceedings under the confiscation act should, it
appears to me, be settled formal'y by legislation."
(Evidence, 218,1 Paine C. C. K., 646..)
And in May, 1865, General Thomas, then in
command of Tennessee, declared " it was not
right at that time to turn over the roads," and
he refused to do bo. (Evidence, 167.)
Under the same orders of the President,
utterly without authority of law, the railroad
rolling stock held by the Government by pur-
chase, construction, or cap tut*, was sold to
southern railroad companies on a valuation,
payable in equal monthly installments for two
years, with interest at seven and three tenths
per cent, per annum, amounting in all to
$10,894,944 29, including sales to the Nash-
ville and Northwestern Company for $525,-
400 26, and to the Nashville and Chattanooga
Company for $1,500,551 78.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Was that not done under
the advice of the Secretary of War, Mr. Stan- |
ton?
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. No, sir; it. ;
was not. |
Mr. ELDRIDGE. Did he not think it was I
all right for opening channels of cominunica- !
tion and commerce throughout the country ?
And did he not tell the committee at the same
time that it was costing millious to conduct !
these roads under the authority of the United
States?
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I insist once
and for all time that advice given in violation
of law is no justification for usurpation of
power. But as a matter of fact I say that Sec-
retary Stanton did not advise the executive
orders of the President for the surrender of
these railroads.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I want to know from
the gentleman from Ohio whether he denies
the fact that Secretary Stanton said all that
was with his advice and approbation.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I have no
recollection of any such testimony.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I tell the gentleman
he will find it in the testimony that Secretary
Stanton not only advised that but every step
the President took on the subject.
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. I am sure that
Secretary Stanton never advised the executive
orders for the sale of these railroads. It is
probable that he deemed it advisable to aban-
don military possession of them; but the Pres-
ident's orders contemplate a surrender which
abandoned all claim on them.
Mr. BOYER. Was not the same thing done
in reference to other railroads in which the
President had no bonds and in which he had
no interest whatever?
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. Certainly he
did not limit his usurpation to a single road ;
he extended it wherever he could favor the
rebels. *
Mr. BOYER. Does not the gentleman
know it was done first in reference to roads in
which the President had no interest; and that
the road in which he had an interest was long
after the precedent had been established in
regard to other railroads?
Mr. LAWRENCE, of Ohio. The two exec-
utive orders of the President extended to all
railroads then in the military possession of the
Government.
extending time op payment.
But this is not all. On the 22d of May,
1866, the Nashville and Chattanooga Company
owed the Government $1,564,836 99, on
! which the interest and installments due were
$325,398 99. (House Executive Document
155, first session Thirty-Ninth Congress, 518,
241, 1125, &c.) The President was informed
that this company had money " on deposit to
meet interest on [its] bonds" which was suffi-
cient to pay the "amount due the Govern-
ment." (Evidence, 240.) But on the mere
letter of request of John McClellan for M.
Barnes, with no sworn- or other evidence, the
President, without any authority of law,
ordered " that collection be suspended until
further orders." (Evidence, 240.) I will
' not now inquire what might be done by
military authority for military purposes, for
no such power was invoked or exerpised.
By these acts the President, without law,
disposed of the property of the nation of
the value of many millions. His orders for
that purpose were made only a few weeks
before the assembling of Congress in 1865.
His sales were carried on and his postponement
of payment of money due the United States
11 were while Congress was in session, yet he
■ never consulted the Taw-making power or
called attention to what he was doing.
One of his relatives was a stockholder in one
of these roads, aud was paid a liberal fee for
sevices in getting the road "turned over."
(Evidence, 169, 1124, &c.) The President him-
self prior to the rebellion and ever since was the
owner of nineteen coupon bonds of $1,000
each, issued by the State of Tennessee for the
payment of the principal and annual interest,
of which the Nashville and Chattanooga Rail-
road Company was bound with a guarantee
also by the State. (Evidence, 634, 643, Laws
of Tennessee, 1851-52, page 82; Evidence,
1125, 163.) The interest had not been paid
since about 1861. (Evidence, 634, 1130.)
The result was the Government was not paid,
but the long-deferred interest coupons of the
President, amounting to over five thousand
dollars, were, and his account had credit
! accordingly in the First National Bank of
i Washington, in May, 1S66. (Evidence, 182.)
' The President, in his executive order of
I August 8, 1865, made a provision applicable
to no other State but Tennessee, which pro-
! vided that—
! " All railroads in Tennessee will be required to
pay all arrearages of interest due on the bonds issued
by that State prior to the date of its pretended seces-
sion from the Union, to aid in the construction of
said roads before any dividends are declared or paid
to the stockholders thereof."
The minority report of the Judiciary Com-
mittee, referring to these sales, says:
" There was no law for this, and every such salo
was illegal. But every unlawful act is not a crime.
Were these things done with intent to violate law
and injure the Government? Even under the broad
doctrine that a civil officer may be impeached for a
common law crime these things must appear."—
Page 99.
But I affirm that when an officer acts without
laic, or even in a mere ministerial capacity, but
having no discretion under a law, the rule is
not as stated.
Bishop says:
" When a man serves in a judicial or other capacity
in which he is called [by law] to exercise a judgment
of his own, he is not punishable for a mere error
therein or for a mistake of the law. Here the act,
to be cognizable criminally or even civilly, must be
willful and corrupt."—Criminal Law, 913.
But he says:
" When a statute forbids a thing affecting the pub-
lic," * * * * " the doing of it is indict-
able at common law."—535.
The same rule must exist when no law
authorizes it.
I will not now stop to inquire how far the
evidence establishes a corrupt purpose. If
presidential edicts may take the place of law
and dispose of millions of the people's earn-
ings the President may sell the Navy or ex-
change our Territories for some barren island,
and he will find apologists and defenders who
will proclaim him guiltless of impeachable
crimes.
One usurpation might invoke a charitable
construction, but multiplied crimes can plead
no such indulgence.
These instances of the surrender of Gov-
ernment property do not stand alone.
other property.
On the 8th of July, 1865, the President
authorized the provisional governor of North
Carolina to—
" Appropriate for the inevitable and indispensable
expenses of the civil government of tho State dur-
ing the continuance of the provisional government"
property "as well as funds lying about indifferent
places in the State and elsewhere not reduced into
possession by the United States officers as insurgent
! property."
| And Government property to the amount
i of $100,000 was so appropriated, and other
' expenses of the provisional governments were
! paid directly from the Treasury of the United
i States. (Evidence, 770.)

I pass over the surrender of money, the pro-

act which provides for refunding only on the
judgment of the Court of Claims. (Act March
