(Received 4 p. M.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The Switzerland, at Madison, and the Lancaster and Queen [of the West], here, are progressing rapidly. Boats at all suitable are very scarce. The Monarch will be here to-night, and will be purchased by Mr. Butler at my instance, subject to your sanction, for $14,000. I propose, if you confirm the bargain, to send her immediately to New Albany to be prepared. I will leave for Pittsburg in the morning.

A. STAGER:

I have sent party to Huntsville and operators to work that railroad line as far as General Mitchel controls, and to repair from Stevenson this way. I asked General Buell for an escort to send another party to meet them, but he thinks it too unsafe to send them. I think it would be safe enough with two companies of cavalry, or even one, and could be repaired in two or three days if not too many bridges gone.

BRUCH.

GENERAL: Captain Sheridan will take charge of the repair of the roads from the main landing to your headquarters, and Colonel McKibbin from the lower or forage landing to the same point, and Colonel Cutts from that point to Shiloh Cross-Roads. Colonel Thom will make examination for roads in advance of Shiloh to your new camping-grounds. These officers will report to you early to-morrow morning for working parties, which will be detailed from the different divisions along the roads. It is of the utmost importance that these roads should be put in order without further delay. You will, therefore, see that working parties provided with tools be ready to commence operations to-morrow morning. Each regiment, brigade, and division as it takes position in new camps will open proper communications with the main roads. With proper care your armycan be supplied far in advance of present position without additional transportation.
