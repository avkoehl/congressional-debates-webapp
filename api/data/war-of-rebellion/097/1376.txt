hoping that you will give it such a direction as to bring about proper action, and only remarking, in addition, that the writer had no idea that I would make this use of his letter, and that I desire you not to use his name without his permission, which you can doubtless readily obtain. I have not shown it to the general for the reason above stated, but I think the subject too important and pressing to wait until he may be less occupied. The State and Confederate authorities should both be advised at once and take action in the matter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES MARSHALL.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 1, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding, Richmond:

General Lee thinks that the Twenty-fourth Corps is on the other side operating against our right, and of course wants some of the force that is on this side with him. If it is true that the Twenty-fourth Corps has gone to the south side, Field's division should go there also, but our lines here should be partially occupied at least. Can you, by turning out your battalion and the Cadets, muster 1,500 men and occupy our huts and line son the Charles City road for a week or ten days? It will be necessary, I presume, for you to come out and take the command during my absence. I presume that it cannot be necessary to urge upon you the importance of this assistance.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. LONGSTREET,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 1, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding Department, &amp;c.:

The Local troops will not be required until we have more positive information than we now have of the enemy having moved from this side in force. You will be notified by telegraph when they are wanted.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,April 1, 1865.

Lieutenant General R. S. EWELL,

Commanding Department of Richmond:

General Longstreet directs that you turn out all your Local troops at once and move them down the Charles City road to relieve General Field's division on the outer line of works. You will send an officer ahead, who will acquaint himself with the picket-line, which will be relieved as soon as possible. General Field's pickets will remain till relieved by yours. You had better come out yourself to these headquarters, as General Longstreet will go off with Field's division.

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
