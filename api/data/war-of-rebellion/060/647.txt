HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 6, 1864-7 p. m. (Received 10 p. m.)

Brigadier General R. INGALLS,

Chief Q. M., Army of the Potomac, Washington.

General Kilpatrick telegraphs that the wharf at Urbanna is destroyed, and that troops can be embarked from that point only at high tide, and he proposes crossing at Rappahannock. I have reason to believe the enemy has sent troops toward Fredericksburg with a view of intercepting his return, and I fear if he crosses as high as Rappahannock they will be notified in time to interfere with the movement. Under these circumstances I wish you would ascertain the practicability of bringing him up the Potomac, say as far as Dumfries. If General Meigs has returned, confer with him and the General-in-Chief; also with General Pleasonton who can send Kilpatrick the necessary order as soon as it is decided which route he shall take in return. He has 3,417 men, 3,595 horses, 6 guns, 8 caissons, 3 wagons, and 4 ambulances.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH:

The commanding officer of pickets on the Sperryville pike reports that a citizen whose house is in our lines during the day, says that he has information from rebel scouts that Longstreet is moving up the valley with a force of 75,000. I give you the report for what it is worth.

W. MERRITT,

Brigadier-General.

General MERRITT, Culpeper Court-House:

What valley does the citizen refer to in the information concerning Longstreet? And is it 15,000 or 75,000 men he reports under Longstreet?
