Brig. General JAMES A. GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch received. From station on Missionary Ridge the officer sends the following:

2.30 p.m.

Heavy firing has developed on the line of the Chickamauga near the bridge of northern road leading to Ringgold. Troops are apparently moving to that point.

The general commanding directs me to say he will keep you informed as far as it is possible to discover their intention.

Respectfully,

Captain, and Aide-de-Camp.

ROSSVILLE, September 19, 1863-3.10 p.m.

General JAMES A. GARFIELD:

Whitaker has just reported that the enemy is attacking him in force and asks for re-enforcements. He is on the Red House road about 2 1/2 miles from here. There can be no doubt about there being a large force in and about Ringgold, although it has kept very quiet until this movement against Whitaker.
