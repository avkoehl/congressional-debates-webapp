Brigadier General E. D. TOWNSEND,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Washington, D. C.:

A large number of paroled men are arriving here. They are destitute and out of money. Lieutenant-Colonel Brown, chief paymaster, is out of founds, and these men cannot be furloughed until he gets them. Please have funds sufficient to pay paroled men forwarded to him.

Major General JOHN POPE,

Commanding Military Division of the Missouri:

GENERAL: I sent Captain Jonas to Lexington to look into those matters. I issued orders two weeks ago to all district commanders to put every mounted man in the brush and keep them there and not to let them garrison towns. I shall issue an order to-day on the boat question, as suggested by Mr. Rollins. Captain Coryell has 1,200 horses for issue this morning. My requisitions now in, approved by you, are: Fourteenth Missouri Cavalry, 345; Seventeenth Illinois Cavalry, 200; Thirteenth Missouri Cavalry, 600. The last issued by War Department and has been waiting for issue. This will allow me put 1,000 additional men in active service in Central and Rolla Districts. I have also sent a regiment of infantry to garrison the crossing points on Missouri River, as designated in the order to issue. I hear daily of gangs of these marauders coming into the State. It is a pretty sure indication of the breaking up of Kirby Smith.

M. Jeff. Thompson issued an order for eight regiments and four battalions to concentrate at Jonesborough and other points May 1. He denounces guerrillas, &amp;c. I have a force in Southeast Missouri able to take care of him as soon as the Saint Francis River can be crossed. Would it not be good policy to send down to him and offer the Grant Lee terms, as he is so easy to reach.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
