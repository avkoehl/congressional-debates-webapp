Hon. J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

DEAR SIR: Inclosed please find the letter of Mr. Walter Goodman, president of the Mississippi Central Railroad Company, setting out the present dilapidated condition of that road, the importance of which in a military point of view cannot well be exaggerated. The proposition of Mr. G. is to obtain permission of the Government to export cotton for the purpose of procuring those supplies without which, he says, the road must be abandoned. The president has a perfect knowledge of the importance of the road referred to, and has recently had the opportunity of seeing something of its present condition. As to the proposition to export cotton, it is one which has been so frequently made to you, and under so many different phases, that I presume your views on the subject are well matured, and I shall therefore offer no suggestions. As I expect to visit Mississippi in a few days and to meet with Mr. Goodman, you will oblige me if you can at an early day put me in possession of your response to the application. Permit me, also, to request that you will direct an early reply to be made to my letter inclosing one from General Henry, of Mississippi, relative to the pay of the troops lately commanded by Colonel W. C. Falkner.

Very respectfully,

J. W. CLAPP,

Member of Congress, First District of Mississippi.
