Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Engagement still continues with great vigor. The enemy have not gained a foot, and McCall is doing splendidly. He is showing that his division is equal to the veterans of the Army of the Potomac. Rebel force very large, but our position good, and our men as brave as can be. The stragglers are all to the rear of Morell's men. Just at McCall's. Dispatch as to re-enforcements this moment read. I thank you for them. I am rejoiced that the troops in front of Washington are to be placed under one command. Keep at that and all will be well.

I will answer for it that this army will do all that the country expects of it.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General Commanding.

Secretary of War:

The firing has nearly ceased. I have nearly everything on the way-impediments on the other side of the Chickahominy-and hope to be ready for anything to-morrow.

Please see that Commodore Goldsborough complies promptly with my request. Victory of to-day complete and against great odds.

I almost begin to think we are invincible.

Major-General, Commanding.

State also what number and description of force you still have in your command and how employed.
