FORT LEAVENWORTH, July 20, 1864.

Brigadier General R. B. MITCHELL,

Omaha City:

Governor's call for militia would be more speedy and proper. I have no authority for such a call. Order Collins with most of his force down to Fremont's Orchard and Camp Collins. Make the overland stage route as secure as possible. Confer with Governor Evans, who ought to move his militia in the same way. Direct all your cavalry to be armed, and, horses or no horses, let them move up to take care of posts. Stop any trains that seem to be going into danger. Keep me posted as to your movements and the facts relating to Indians.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

Governor JOHN EVANS,

Denver:

General Mitchell is moving up the valley, and I have directed Collins to move down from Laramie, so as to increase forces at Fremont's Orchard and Camp Collins. Keep me advised. Strike with your militia.

Major-General.
