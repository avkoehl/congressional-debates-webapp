In the above estimate all earth-work inside the camps is supposed to be done by prison labor. It is quite probable that part, perhaps most, of the carpenter's work will have to be done either mechanics by the day or by contract. The sewer, 3,250 feet long, could probably be laid mostly by dX, except the part outside the camp, with proper superintendence.
