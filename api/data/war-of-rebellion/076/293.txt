Colonel Reilly has just returned from his reconnaissance to the left. He passed the left of the line occupied by the Army of the Tennessee during the battle of the 22d, and struck the rebel intrenchments about six miles from Atlanta, and three miles from the Decatur road. He drove before him a considerable force of cavalry, mostly militia, and found a brigade or more of regular infantry in the intrenchments. He kept up his demonstration during the day and retired at night with slight loss.

General Thomas has got two divisions to the right of General Howard, and to-morrow will push forward close to the railroad. General Thomas thinks the enemy must be very weak in Atlanta. Feel your front strong in the morning, and repeat the movement on the left. It is time we heard something of our cavalry.
