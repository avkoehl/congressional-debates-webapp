HDQRS. SECOND Brigadier, SECOND CAV. DIV.,ON ROAD FROM DALTON TO VARNELL'S STATION,

JUST EAST OF TUNNEL MOUNTAIN,

February 24, 1864-2 p. m.

SIR: I have just driven in with one squadron the infantry pickets on the dirt and rail roads 3 miles from Dalton, and am now in line with pickets skirmishing in front. Their cavalry ran into their infantry supports, which they seem to have on all of the roads. I am now 5 miles from Dalton, and do not think it prudent to go any farther until I hear further from you and the result of your reconnaissance.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELI LONG,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigadier, Second Cav. Div.

Major W. H. SINCLAIR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-I send with the bearer one company to remain on picket at Varnell's Station to watch the Cleveland and Dalton road that goes down on the other side of railroad.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ELI LONG,

Colonel, Commanding Second Brigade, Second Division.

I have my command near a gap road which runs through the ridge on your left, with pickets down the railroad some quarter of a mile. Nothing can come through the gap without my knowing, and I think this is the only road between here and Dalton through which a force can get on your flank or rear, and as my ammunition in nearly exhausted I will remain here until further orders.

Respectfully,

ELI. LONG,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.

General CRUFT.
