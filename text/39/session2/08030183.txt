Beit enacted by the Senate and Houseof Rep-
resentatives of the United States of America in
Congress assembled, That the several courts
of the United States, and the several justices
and judges of such courts, within their respect-
ive jurisdictions, in addition to the authority
already conferred by law, shall have power to
grant writs of habeas corpus in all cases where
any person may be restrained of his or her
liberty in violation of the Constitution, or of
any treaty or law of the United States; and it
shall be lawful for such person so restrained of
his or her liberty to apply to either of said
justices or judges for a writ of habeas corpus,
which application shall be in writing and ver-
ified by affidavit, and shall set forth the fa<5ts
concerning the detention of the party applying,
in whose custody he or she is detained, and
by virtue of what claim or authority, if known;
and the said justice or judge to whbm such ap-
plication shall be made shall forthwith award
a writ of habeas corpus, unless it shall appear
from the petition itself that the party is not
deprived of his or her liberty in contravention
of the Constitution or laws of the United States.
Said writ shall be directed to the person in
whose custody the party is detained, who shall
make return of said writ and bring the party
before the judge who granted the writ, and cer-
tify the true cause of the detention of such
person within three days thereafter, unless
such person be detained beyond the distance
of twenty miles; and if beyond the distance of
twenty miles and not above one hundred miles,
then within ten days; and if beyond the dis-
tance of one hundred miles, then within twenty
days. And upon the return of the writ of
habeas corpus a day shall be set for the hear-
ing of the cause, not exceeding five days there-
after, unless the party petitioning shall request
a longer time. The petitioner may deny any
of the material facts set forth in the return, or
may allege any fact to show that the detention
is in contravention of the Constitution or laws
of the United States, which allegations or de-
nials Bhall be made on oath. The said return-
may be amended by leave of the court or judge
before or after the same is filed, as also may
all suggestions made against it, that thereby
the material facts may be ascertained. The
said court or judge shall proceed in a summary
way to determine the facts of the case, by hear*
ing testimony and the arguments of the parties
interested, and if it shall appear that the peti-
tioner is deprived of his or her liberty in con-
travention of the Constitution or laws of the
United States, he or she shall forthwith be dis-
charged and set at liberty. And if any person
or persons to whom such writ of habeas corpus
may be directed shall refuse to obey the same,
or shall neglect or refuse to make return, or
shall make a false return thereto, in addition
to the remedies already given by law, he or
they shall be deemed and taken to be guilty of
a misdemeanor, and shall, on conviction be-
fore any court of competent jurisdiction, be
punished by fine not exceeding one thousand
dollars, and by imprisonment not exceeding
one year, or by either, according to the nature
and aggravation of the case. From the final
decision of any judge, justice, or court, infe-
rior to the circuit court, an appeal may be taken
to the circuit court of the United States for the
district in which said cause is heard, and from
the judgment of said circuit court to the Su-
preme Court of the United States, on such
terms and under such regulations and orders,
as well for the custody and appearance of the
person alleged to be restrained of his or her
liberty, as for sending up to the appellate tri-
bunal a transcript of the petition, writ of habeas
corpus, return thereto, and other proceedings,
as may be prescribed by the Supreme Court,
or, in default of such, as the judge hearing said
cause may prescribe; and pending such pro-
ceedings or appeal, and until final judgment be
rendered therein, and after final judgment of
discharge in the same, any proceeding against
such person so alleged to be restrained of his
or her liberty in any State court, or by or un-
der the authority of any State, for any matter
or thing so heard and determined, or in pro-
cess of being heard and determined, under and
by virtue of such writ of habeas corpus, shall
be deemed null and void.
