Sept. 1837.____________APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.__________________169
25th Cose.... 1st Sess.                   ^        Making public officers depositories—Mr. Webster.                                                  Senate.
Now, sir, my piesent purpose chiefly is to main-
tain two propositions •
1.  That i$ the constitutional duty of this Gov-
ernment to see that a proper currency, suitable to
the circumstances of the times, and to the wants of
trade and business, as well a* to the payment
of debts due to Government, be maintained and ■
presei ved , a currency of general credit, and capa-
ble of aiding the operations of exchange, so far a=
those operations may be conducted by means of
the circulating medium, and that there are duties,
therefore, devolving on Congress, in. relation to
curiency, beyond the mere regulation, of the gold
and silver coins.
2.  That the message, the bill, and the proposed
amendment, all, in effect, deny any such duty, dis-
claim all such power, and confine the constitutional
obligation of Government to the mere regulation of
the coins, apd the care of its own revenues
I have well weighed, Mr President, and fully
considered, the first of these propositions, to wit
that which respects the duty of this Government,
in regaid to the currency. I mean to stand by it.
It expresses, in my judgment, a principle fully sus-
tained by the Constitution, and by the usage of the
Government, and which is of the highest practical
importance With this proposition, or this princi-
ple, I am willing to stand connected, and to share
m the judgment which the community shall ulti-
mately pronounce upon it. If the country shall
sustain it, and be ready, in due time, to carry it
into effect, by such means and instruments is the
general opinion shall think be t to adopt, I «hall
co-operate, cheerfully, in any such undertaking,
and shall look again, \uth confidence, to prosperity
in this branch of our national concerns On the
other hand, if the country shall reject th s proposi-
tion, and act on that rejection , if it shall decide
that Congress has no powci, nor is under any duty,
in relation to the currency, beyond the mere regu-
lation of the coins, then, upon that construction of
the powers and duties of Congress, I am willing to
acknowledge that I do not feel myself competent to
render any substantial service to the' public coun-
cils on these great interests I admit at once that
if the currency is not to be preserved by the Gov-
ernment of the United States, I know not how it is
to be guarded against constantly occurring disor
ders and derangements
Before entering into the discussion of the grounds
of this proposition, however, ?Uow me, sir, a few
words, by way ot prelimmaiy explanation In the
first place, I wish it to be observed that I am now
contending only for the general prmsiple, and not
insisting eithei on the constitutionality or expedi-
ency of any particular means, or any particular
agent I am not saying by what instrument or
agent Congress ought to peiform this duty , I only
say it is a duty, which, in some mode and by some
means, Congress is bound to perform. In the next
place, let it be remembered that I carry the absolute
duty of Government, m regard 1o exchange, no
farther than the operations of exchange may be
perfoimeJby currency. No doubt, sir, a proper
institution, established by Government, might, as
heretofore, give other facilities to exchange of great
importance, and to a very great extent But I
intend, on this occasion, to keep cleatly within the
Constitution, and to assign no duty to Congress
not plainly enjoined by the provisions of that in-
strument, as fairly interpreted, and as heretofore
understood.
The President says, it is not the province of
Government to aid individuals in the tiansfer of
their funds,fotherwise than by the use of the post
office, and that it might as justly be called on to
provide for the transportation of their merchan-
dise
Now, I beg leave to say, sn, with all respect and
deference, that fundi  are transferred from indi-
vidual to individual, usually for the direct purpose
of the payment and receipt of debts , that payment
and receipt are duties of cuirency , that, in my
opinion, currency is a thing which Government is
bound to provide for and superintend, that the
case, therefore, has not the slightest resemblance to
the transportation of merchandise, because the
transportation of merchandise is earned on b) ships
aid boats, by carts and wagons, and not by the use
of currency, or of any thmg else over which Gov-
ernment has usually exclusive control. These
things individuals can provide for themselves. But
the transfer of funds is done by credit, and must
be so done, and some proper medium for this
transfer it is the duty of Government to provide,
because it belongs to currenc3', to money, and is
therefore beyond the power of individuals
The nature of exchange, sir, is well understood
by persons engaged in commerce, but as its opera-
tions are a little out of the sight of other classes op
the community, although they have all a deep and
permanent interest m the subject, I may be par-
doned for a word or two ot general explanation
I speak of domestic exchanges only. We mean,
then, by exchange, this same transfer of funds
We mean the making of payment in a distant
place, or the receiving of payment from a distant
place, by some mode of paper credits. If done by
draft, order, or bill of exchange, that is one form,
if done by the transmission ol bank notes, through
the post office, or otherwise, that is another form
In each, credit is used , m the first, the credit of
the parties whose names are on the bill or
draft, in the last, the credit of the bank Ev ery
man, sir, who looks over this vast country, and
contemplates the commercial connection ol its
various parts, must see the great importance that
th-s exchange should be cheap and easy To
the producer and to die consumer, to the manufac-
turer and the planter, to the merchant, to all, in all
classes, this becomes a matter of moment We
may see an instance in the common articles of
manufacture produced m the north, and sent to the
south and west for sale and consumption Hats,
shoes, furniture, carriages, domestic hardware, and
various other articles, the produce of those manu-
factories, and of those employments which are cai-
ned on without the aid of large capital, constitute
a large pait of this trade, as well as the fpbrics of
cotton and wool. Now a state of exchange, which
shall enable the producers to receive payment regu-
larly, and without loss, is indispensable to any use-
ful prosecution of this intercourse Derangement
of currency and exchange is ruinous The notes
of local banks will not answer the purpose of re-
mittance , and if bills of exenange cannot be had,
or can be had only at a high rate, how is pajment
to be i eceived, or to be received without great loss '
This evil was severely felt, even before the suspen-
sion of specie payment bj the banks , and it will
alwajsbe felt, more 01 le=s, till there is a cariency
of geneial credit and circulation through the coun-
tiy But vhen the banks suspend3d,it became
overwhelming AH gentlemen having northern
acquaintance, must know the existence of this evil
I have heard it said that the hitherto prosperous
a^d flourishing tow n of Newark has already lost a
considerable pait or its population by the breaking
up of its business, m cons quence of these com-
mercial embarrassments. And in cases in which
ousmess is not wholly broken up, if five or six per
cent,, oi more, 's to be paid for exchange, it by so
much enhances the cost to the consumer, or takes
away his profit from the producer I have men-
tioned these articles of common product of «íorth-
ern labor, but the same evil exists in alt the sales
of imported goods, and it must exist, also, m the
south, in the operations connected w ith its gieat
staples All the south must have, and has, con-
stant occasion for remittance by exchange , and no
part of the country is likely to suffer more severely
by its derangement In short, there can be no sat-
isfactory state of internal tiade, when there is nei-
ther cheapness, nor promptness, nor regularity, nor
security, in the domestic exchanges
I 'ay again, sn, that I do not hold Government
bound lo provide bills of exchange for purchase
and sale Nobody thinks of such a thing If am
institution established by Government cm do thir,
as might be the case, and has been the case, so
much the better But the positive obligation-, of
Government I am content to limit to cuirency, and,
so far as exchange is concerned, to the aid which
may be afforded to exchange by currency I have
been informed th?t, a few y eats ago, before the
chaiter of the late bank expired, at those seasons
of the year when southern and western merchants
usually visit the northern cities to make purchases,
or make payment for existing liabilities, that bank
redeemed its notes to the amount of fifty or even a
hundred thousand dollars a day These notes,
having been issued m the West, were brought oyer
the mountains as funds to be used in the eastern
cities This was exchange , and it was exchange
through the medium of currency, it was perfectly
safe, and it cost nothing This fact illustrates the
importance of a currenc3r oí universal credit to the
business of exchange.
Having made these remarks for the purpose of
explaining exchange, and showmg its connexion
with currency, I proceed to discuss the general pro-
positions
Is it the duty, then, of this Government to see
that a currency be maintained suited to the circum-
stances of the times, and to the uses of trade and
commerce'
I need not, sir, on this occasion, enter histori-
cal!} into the well-known causes which led to the
adoption of the present Constitution. Those causes
are familiar to all public men , and among them,
ceitamly, was this very mattei of giving credit and
uniformity to the money system of the country.
The States possessed no system of money and en-
culation, and that was among the causes of the
stagnation of commerce Indeed, all commercial
affairs were m a disjointed, deranged, and misera-
ble state The rtstoiation of commerce, the object
of giving it uniformity, credit, and national charac-
ter, were among the first incentives to a more pei-
ftct union of the States We all know that the
meeting at Annapolis, in 1786, sprang from a de-
sire to a'tempt something whicn should gi/e uni-
formity to the commercial operations of the several
States , and that in and with this meeting arose the
proposition for i general convention, to consider of
a new constitution of Government Eveiy where
State cun^ncn-s weie dep^cc at™d, ail continental
money was o.epieciatcd ilso Debts could not be
paid, and there was no value to property. From
the close of the war to the time of the adoption of
this Constitution, as I verily believe, the people
suffered as much, except m the loss of life, from
the disordered state of the curiency and the pros-
tration of commerce and business, as they suffered
during the w ar All our history shows the disas-
ters and afflictions which sprang from these
sources , and it would be waste of time to go mto a
detailed recital of them For the remedy of these
evils, a one of its gie?t objects, and as great as
any one, the Constitution was formed and adopted.
Now, sit, bv this Constitution, Congress is au-
thorized to " coin money,, to regulate the value
thereof, and of foreign coins," and all the States
are prohibited fiom coming money, and from
making any thing but gold and silver coins a ten-
der in payment of debts Suppose the Constitution
had stopped hete, it w ould still have established
the aU-important point of a uniform money system
By this provision Congress i' to furnish com, or
regulate con, for all the States There is to be
but ore money standaid for the country And the
standard of value to be established by Congress is
to be a currency, and no' bu'lion merely, because
w e find it is to be coin, that is, it is to be one or the
other of the piecious metals, bearing an authentic
stamp of -value, and p tssing therefoie by tale
That is to be ne slamlaid of \alue A standard of
value, thcefor" and a mon j for ci culat'on, weie
thus expressly pro' ided foi And if nothing else
had been done, veould it not have bien a reasona-
ble and necessary inference fmm this pow er, that
Congress bad authority to íegulate, and must regu-
la e and control, any and all paper, which either
States 01 individuals might desne to put into circu-
lation pui porting to represent this coin, and to bke
its placo jr. the uses cf trade and commerce' It is
very ev ulent that the Constitution m'ended some-
th ng more than to provide a medium for the pay-
ment of debts to Government The ODjcct was a
nniloim cuirency for the use of the v/hole people,
m all thetransac'ions of life, and it was manifestly
the intent of the Constitution, that the power to
maintain such a currencv should be ei\cn lo Con-
gress But it would make the s\stcm incongruous
and incomplete, it would be denvmg to Congress
•he means necessary to accomplish ends which
were manifestly  intended, it would  render  the
