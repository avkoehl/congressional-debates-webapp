j RECOMMENDATION TO APPOINT A LIEUTEN-
; ANT-GENERAL OF THE ARMY, ETC.
! The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a
' maesage from the Pie&ident of the-United States;
. which was read by the Secretary, as follows:
Washington, December 29, 18-46.
i To the Senate anJ Hovse of R-^.reicutativea :
j In order to prosecute the war against Mexiro with vjjroi
! and .-Ulceus, it i* necessary that autnoritv should be pronipt-
; lygiv:n hv Congress to wciease the regular army, and to
remedy exiting defectum ltsoiaain/ation. With this view,
j youi favoiahle attention is invited to the annual repotf of
â–  the Sectetary of War, winch accompanied my menage of
â€¢ the 8th in-taut, in which he 4ecommend- that ten additional
ipgimpnt* of lobular troops shall be ruined, to txrve durin"
' the war. 45
Of the additional respment< of volunteeis which have been
j called tot honi several of the Stare*, some have been prompt-
, iy uiissed, but tin- has not been rhe ease in rcjr.mi to Ml; the
j existing law, requmng that they ^ould be oiganized bv the
| independent action of the Wate Governments, has, in some
I instance;*, occasioned considerable delay, and it is yet un-
! certain when the troops lerjuircd can he ready for sci viee in
1 the held.
It is oui sculed policy to maintain, in tune of peace, aa
small a regular army a^ the cxiseneies of the public servic <5
will pÂ°innt. Tn a state of war, notwithstanding the great
advantages with whieh our volunteer citizen soldier can
be brought into the field, tins small legula' arin> must be *
mcieased m its numbers, m order to render the whole foice
more efficient.
Additional officers, as well as men, then become indis-
pensable. Under the circumstances of om service, a pecu-
liar propriety exists* for increasing the officer's, especially in
the higher grades. The number of such officers who, from
nee and other causes, are rendered incapable of active ser-
vice in the field, has seiioiHy impaired the efficiency of the
army.
From the report of the Secretary of War, it appears that
about two-thirds of the whole regimental lield officers are
