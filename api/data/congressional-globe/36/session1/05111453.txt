REPRESENTATIVES OP CHARLES POETERFIELD.
The SPEAKER stated the first business in
order to be the question on the passage of a bill
(PI. R. No. 243) for the relief of the legal repre-
sentatives of Charles Porterfield, deceased, re-
ported from the Committee of the Whole House
on Friday last.
Mr. HARRIS, of Virginia. That bill was be-
fore the House on Friday last, and was then dis-
cussed in a hasty manlier; as long, however, as
I think necessary,as it is a matter of form rather
than of substance that we are asking at the
hands of the House. The bill did not pass then
for the want of a quorum. Believing that no fur-
ther discussion is necessary, I move the previous
question.
Mr. NOELL. The previous question was or-
dered on this bill last Friday.
The SPEAKER. Yes, sir; and the question
is now on the passage of the bill.
The bill was passed.
Mr. HARRIS, of Virginia, moved to recon-
sider the vote by which the bill was passed; and

ware is entitled to the floor.

reading of the bill.

ought to be considered in Committee of the Whole
House. If it is allowed to go there, I will not
make any motion to lay it on the table.
