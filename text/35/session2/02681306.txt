1806
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
February 24,
reached what it had been at the time of the reduc-
tion. I have a statement of what the gross amount
ofpostage was in England in theyear when the very
groat redaction was made in that country. Itwas,
under the old rales, something tike two million
pounds sterling; and it was not until ten years
after the reduction that the amount rose to what
it had been under the former rate. It required
ten years, in England, with their very great
amount of business, to bring the gross revenues
up to what they had been previous to the reduc-
tion of postage; whereas, in this country it re-
quired only three yeais, under the last experi-
ment, and under the first one, only five years.
It cannot then be called a failure. The system
itself has proved eminently successful, far more
so than its friends supposed or expected. The
difficulty has been that it has been loaded down
with enormous and most unreasonable expenses.
Some Senators tell us that the business portion of
the community, living' for the most part in the
northern States, desire to tax the whole country
to pay the expense of their postage. What is the
fact in regard to it? 1 wish to call the attention
of the Senate, for a single moment, to those por-
tions of the country in which the vast inciease of
expenditure has taken place. It has not been in
the New England States; it has not been in New
York, or Pennsylvania; it has not been in those
States which are supposed to be most interested
in this question of postage. It has been in the
southern and the western States. I have before
me a table showing the amount of receipts and
expenses in the dill'erent States of the Union; and
I desire to call the attention of the Senate to a few
of the States. In this table it is stated that there
are only three States of the Union which pay the
expenses of their postage, and those three States
are Massachusetts, New Yoik, and Rhode Island.
These three States are said to be the only States
which, at the present rate of postage, pay the an-
nual expense of carrying the mail and the general
postal expenses in those States.
Mr. YULEE. If the Senator will look at an-
other report from the Postmaster General, he will
find it stated that, when you include the expense
of route and other agencies, and deduct from Mas-
sachusetts and New York the amount which they
collect on foreign postage, and which is introduced
under the head of" letter postage," there is not
a single State in the Union, the income of which
from postage, pays the expenses.
Mr. DIXON. I will undertake to say that there
is one State. Other Senators may answer for
their own States. I say the State of Connecticut
does pay her own expenses in this respect.
Mr. YULEE. Rhode Island, from her small
area, may do it.
Mr. DIXON. The State of Connecticut pays
in postage every dollar, and more, of the cost of
carrying the mail within her limits, and she re-
ceives nothing, or very little, from foreign post-
age. The Postmaster General has, in his report,
brought the State of Connecticut in debt about
ten thousand dollars. He states that the postal
expense in that State are some ten thousand dol-
lars more than the amount of the receipts; and
how does he make it out? Whenever there is
any lailroad service in that State, he charges the
whole amount of the service to the State of Con-
necticut, although, in some instances, two thirds,
and in many instances, one third of the whole
service is in other States. Our railroads run into
j Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and New York,
i but the whole expense of that service is cliargcd
i to Connecticut. You should make a fair deduc-
j tion of that proportion of the expense which
! should be charged to the other States. The whole
| amount of raiiroad service charged to Connecti-
! cut is about eighty thousand dollars; you should,
j at least, deduct twenty or thirty thousand dollars:
i that would be a very moderate computation. If
you do that, you show that the State of Conncc-
! ticut actually pays some ten or fifteen thousand
! dollars more than the whole amount of the ex-
pense which the Post Office Department costs in
that State; so that the Senator from Florida will
see that there is at least one State in the Union
which does pay. I think it can be shown that
there are other States which also pay; but one
thing is certain; if it cannot be shown that more
than one State, not only in New England, but in
the entire North, actually pays the whole amount
of its postage, and more, it can be shown that,
taking the mass of those States, they pay a great
deal more. If you take eight or ten of those
States together, ynu will find, by mingling their
expenses and receipts, that the receipts do very
much exceed the expenses; whereas tile great de-
ficiency, the immense falling off, is in the south-
ern ana the new States.
The following table from the Postmaster Gen-
eral's report, will give his statement of the ex-
penses ill each State. I have explained the injus-
tice he dues to Connecticut;
Ji recapitulation of the amount of letter postage, newspaper postage, registered letters, postage stamps sold, compensation allowed postmasters, incidental expenses of
post ojfices, and amount credited contractors and others jor the transportation oj the mails in each Slate and Territoiy,for the year ending June 30, 1856.

If ynu will look ot another table, and see what
is the expense of carrying Ihem.iilin some of the
States.) u'.i Will be enuvhjeed ot tnir*. Take, for
instance, the Buuc of Mairi'r, the whole1 eKpeuse
there is £132,000. Then take the State of Tex*.v35
and it is $470,000—liearlyhalf a million. So, if I
had time ton;o through, I could show that the ex-
jiunsr is far ^icater in the new St-ues, and in those

vcrv great amount of business, than in the northern

Florida, chairman of the committee, he will find
that the expenses greatly exceed the receipts.
Tne following tabic gives the expense of mail
