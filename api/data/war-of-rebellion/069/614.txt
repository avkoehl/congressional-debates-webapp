Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 5, 1864.

[General GRIFFIN:]

GENERAL: The major-general commanding wishes me to inquire whether the firing heard in your front is the enemy pushing us, or our troops advancing.

Very respectfully,

A. S. MARVIN, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

[Indorsement.]

It is Colonel Sweitzer pushing out a line of skirmishers on the Shady Grove road, just beyond Barker's house.

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIFTH CORPS,June 5, 1864-6 p. m.

[General WARREN:]

GENERAL: The enemy occupy the line vacated by General Burnside. Our line first struck cavalry, then infantry and two pieces of artillery. If this is satisfactory I will withdraw to my former line, as it will take a brigade to carry his entrenched line.

CHAS. GRIFFIN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,June 5, 1864-7 p. m.

General GRIFFIN:

If the enemy have forced your skirmish line so far back as to expose our movement to-night, drive them back again far enough to conceal it.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.
