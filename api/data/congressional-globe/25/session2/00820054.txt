He m > uld go on in his quiet, calm, " amiable"
wai , but should endeavor candidly, fairly and
fev!<"- h, to discbarge his duty to his constituents
at 1 to the country, regardless of denunciations, or
lenoachc, or hard words, or hard names, let them
come from what quarter they might.
Sir, no one better understands or more dexter-
ously practices, the maxim, " that names are
things," than that gent'eman , m his long course
of political warfare, he has found that names are
cheaper than facts or prguments, and are a ready
resource when the latter may not be at hand
Like the honest and humane quaker, who ab-
horred taking life or shedding blood, he could
not e.en kill his dog, yet he eou'd go into
the street, and give him a had name, he could
cry "Mad dog1" And the Sensior, wnen he can-
not successfully oppose measures by argument and
fair discussion, thinks hs can destroy them by
denunciations, execrations, and by giving them a
bad name The gentleman and his fi lends have
had much experience m this way, the adroit use of
names is a game they have long been playing
They have improved on the maxim that names are
things, as they seem to suppose that names will
alter things, will change principles, will make right
wrong, and wrong right Yes, sir. tt seers to be
believed by these experienced tacticians that the
people can be hoodwinked and deceived by a skil-
ful use of names discrcetl) applied, that good men
and good measures can, by fixing upon them a bad
name, be rendered unpopular, odious, and execra-
ble, and that bad measures—measures which have
been thrice repudiated by the people—and, he
■would not say bad men, but men whs have lost
the popular favor and forfeited the public con-
fidence, could, simply by the magic of a good
name, a popular name, regain the character thev
had lost, and become once more the favorites of the
people
Mr. CLAY had but a word to say He hoped
his amiable friend from Connecticut (Mr. N.)
would spare him a little—would not crucify him
outright—but when viewing his (Mr. C's) motives,
would put on different spectacles. He (Mr N )
had h?d his eves, loo loBg, perhaps, turned toward
a certain building he could name. Should the ho-
norable Senator, instead, study a little moie of par-
liamentary etiquette, he might find to what length
epithet might be app'ied to sentiment
Mr NILES The Senator alludes to th  "White
House," and m'imates that he (Mr. 2T.) was under
some magic influence from that quarter, be could
assure him he was entirely mistaken, the White
House had no special attractions and no teircs
with him, he asked nothing, expected nothing,
and feared nothing, from that quarter, he, ho v-
ever, respected the present occupant oi tha White
House as a man, and had ful! confidence in his
capacity, his sound discretion, his mt ™.f,
and his enlightened and patriotic seutinun1 ,
as Chief Magistrateof this gieatRepublic. He hid
aho more than respected—he had felt th= highest
admiration for—the illustrious and veneiable man
who had recently occupied that House, brt be bad
neither asked or desired any thing from c 'her 1
can say («aid Mr N ) this much in fel.it o i to Ui„
White House Can the Senator say os mui h'
Has the White House no attractions forb'nY* Has
he nevei cast a longing eye toward it' Has it no
influence on his actions here' Sir, (said Mr. N )
I hope I shall be excused for inferring to a fact
communicated to me the other day bv one of the
city «ass, whicn was, that a distmgu shed Senator,
who had not visited the White Honre foi more
than eisht years, had recently been there, he re-
garded the circumstance as highly important and
very saspicious, but was well satisfied m his onn
mind that *' e object of the Senate was toe\ urn le
the premi "s and to satisfy himself wheihoi they
would be like'y to be m a t°nantable condii on
about three \ ears hi nee

\fter the reading of the journal,
Mr. CAMPBELL asked leave to make a state-
ment m relation to a paragraph which had recently
apneared m a newspaper headed "Dissolution of
tne Union " Leav' being gi anted, Mr C read
the paragraph alluded to, which stated, in sub-
stance, tint Mr C hid invited the south"rn dele-
gation, among other objects, to meet for the pur-
pose oí considering a p'opos uott for the dissolution
of the Union
Mi. C then observed, that if he alone weie in-
terested m the matter, he -would not haie ca''e(

made, dtbe dnectly or indirectly to tie dissolu-

of a memorial presented by Mr. Adams on Mon-
day week, from the New York Peace Society, and
other individuals friendly to the peace cause, pray-
ing Congress to accede to the proposition of the
Mexican Congreso
[This proposition was couched m the fol'owmg
te-ms, contained m a decree of that Congress,
dated Mav 20, 1337, viz
" The Government is hereby authonred to com-
promise the claims which the Government of the
United Stites has ¡nst tuted, or maj hereafter insti
tute, and thos  ,n which they cannot acrre", mav

Mr C however felt it due to say to the House,
once for all, tnat the duty he owed to himself, the
regard he had for the dignity of the House, and the
respect he hid for the exalted station that gentle-
man once filled, wouid alwa5's present lum from
imitating his example m violating decorum and the
rules of order He should regret to be called to
oiler, and to be directed day after day, by the
Speaker ?nd the members of the House, to take his
seaf for transgressing the rules. Tne gentleman

colleag'fs     Mr. C. congratulated both the cham-

The gentleman from Massachusetts had attack-
ed the Committee of Y/ays and Means for not
r^admg the memorials presented at the late session
for the establishment ot a ITational Bank. Here
l ey are, said Mr. C. (hold rg them in his hand )
F tc and io'ty of them from e\eit qjaiter of this
Union, forty-four of them beginning with the fol-
lowing annunciation "Tnat m the mida of pro-

"that m the midst of profound peace, embarrassed
by no great political struggles " Tbey had been
printed twei y times over, bv ord<=r o' the House.
Every member of the committee had read them a
half do/ei times over
Now, sn, (continued Mr. C.) if these questions
should ever come befoie us again, tins novel, this
fiesh, Ih s interesting subject of the establishment
ofaBankof the United States, I thmk I should
propose m the committee that a sub-committee be
appointed to rea 1 all these memorials seriatim, and
I should bj nay of pssurance that the selected
committee wou'd do its duty, ask the House to
appoint the Committee on Manufaciures (of which
Mr Adams is chairman) to ntrform that ta=k
