THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 24,
entirely disregarded—nay violated—because it has
been neglected heretofore'
It may be, sir, that I am mistaken on this sub-
ject I am willing, however, to abide the conse
quences of that mistake, and record my vote in
favor of this proposition
Mr HARDIN (owing to a considerable stir,
Mi H 's remarks weie occasionally inaudible at
the reporter's desk) was believed to say that with
out pretending to understand what members of
that House proposed by the resolution, but behev
ins; that gentlemen did intend it should bear upon
all the elections of that Ho >e, he was satisfied,
so far as the elections ot Speaker, seigea t-at
arms, door keeper, assistant door keepei, messen-
gers, &c , were concerned, that the resolution
should be adopter", tior if his honorable friend
fiom Illinois [Mi llt\molds] desned to place the
record of his own vote upon the Journal  would
he have any objection, but theie were certain
officers of the House, if they were officers, in the
election of whom certain conditions were supu
later! for, and wmch must be complied with, or
the contiact made with them would not be wordi
a cent Mi fl then put the case of sherifls ben g
elected in a State Legislature in the mannei pro
posed by the íesolution, vna toce, and the law in
force de< tared he should be appointed in adifferint
way, would the bond required of him be bidding '
Certainly not And so in the present case, if they
were to direct the election of their pmter in any
o her mode than that provided for by the law in
force, the stipulations under the contract made i
with him would be invalid Heundeistood there
had been a variety of modes of electing the print- ,
eis of that House and of the Senate, and great I
complaints made at foimei periods, on account of
their extravagant chaiges and the manner in
which their accounts were audited by the House
In 1810, a committee was raisid fn the pulpóse
of investigating the whole subject, who made a
report, and Die&ented a resolution, which received
the sanction of Congress Mr H here read from
the resolution a lengthy extract, showing the
mannei m which the work was to be executed,
tne puces to be paid, &c Now, said Mi H ,
here was a certain law, fixing the pay (or printing,
and prescribing that the printer shou'd give bond
for the faithful performance of his contract It
moreover prescribed, uiat in the event of the
printer failing to do so, the Clerk of the House
was emjoweted to employ some one else, the
contracting printer to pay for any loss that might
accrue in consequence theieof Mr II waspio
ceedmg on this point, when
Mr VANDCRPOCL rose to a question of
order He would lespectfully inquire of the
Chair if it was in order to argue the question of
electing a public printer, when no such propo&mon
was before the House'
The CHAIR deemed the aipument of the gen
tleman from Kentucky perfectly in order The
resoluuon under discussion provided for the elec
tion of all officers of the House, and as it was
made a question whether the printer was an ofli
cer or not, the remarks of the gentleman came
within the rules of debate
Mr HARDIN proceeded by reading a proviso
he intended to ofFei, and asked the honorable
mover of the resolution if he weie wining to
accept it'   It wa3 read as follows
Provided, That elections ordered by joint reso
lutions of the Senate and House of Representa
Uves, approved and signed by the Piesident, shall
be conducted in mannei and form as aie dnected
by said resolutions
Mr  REYNOLDS dissented
Mr HARDIN was willing to believe the reso-
lution had no particular case in view, but if his
proviso were adopted, every difficulty would be
obviated Suppose we were to disregard the pro
viso, and, under the resolution, proceed to the
election of a printer Mr H would ask, if the
printer would be bound by the contract' Not at
all If he fail in furnishing the  work, and the
Clerk should employ any one else, could we
deduct the same from the stipulation ' No we
could not The lesolution he had before refeired
to, prescribed the form, and they must proceed
according to it The gentleman from Alabama
[Mi McKinley] has discovered that the regula-
tion of 1819 has been repealed We shall see
whethei it is or not [Mr H here read the reso-
lution ] Now, the resolution repealed only just
as much as it altered, and ltahend only that par.,
which piovided that the election biiouid take place
within thuty days of the end of the session That
was the only alteration Did it alter the p ice of
thewoik? No Did italtei themode of appoint-
ing the printer No It only prescribed the time
of election, but left the price of the work, and the
manner of electing, just as the resolution of 1819
did
We were informed that the Constitution of the
United States required all these elections to be
viva voce, that it should be known and spread upon
the journals how each member voted     Mi   H
believed this had never been dnne since the form
ation of this Government in 17S9     The wise men
who fiamed oui system came fiom every quartei i
of the  United States—from the East, where the |
scripture says they shall come fiom   but now, ,
said Mi  II j icosely, thirgs are reversed, and tne I
wise men  are to come fiom the West, (he was
glad of this, for he was a western man himself,)
and discovered errors to which we had been blind
for forty years     Now it was discovered to be
fraught with  danger to elect our o.vn Speaker,
sergeant at arms, door keepers, messenger^, &c
Why, so lit le niteieat did he lake in the elec ion
of these'ofliceis, that about thiee times out of foui,
he took no part in them a* all     Now, howevei, it
was ascertained to be a high responsibility the
representa ive owed to his constituents to record
his vote upon the Journal, and written, he sup
posed, in sun shine on the face of the heavens
What did the people of Illinois care about who
any  of those officers   weie'    lie be'ieved  they
rarely knew their names     Mr  H  would not go
so far as to assert that the resolution pointed to ihe
election of put he printer, but he must say, that }f
the House agreed to tne resolution  it was bour d
to adopt the proviso     Then he thought—he did
not know—but he thought the resolution would
be something like a royal birth in England—still-
born     Mr H concluded by moving the adoption
ot the proviso
Mr   GILMER said, it was remarkable to see
the attention and excitement of the members on this
queslion, and he deemed it important the people
should understind the reason of all this intense
ex< itement     Was it a desire to create a leiorm in
the  administration of the offices  of the House'
Not at all—that was not pretended     It could be
traced   to principles which   «duck  at  the  very
foundations of this Government, and which, if
not   checked, must render  it ihe most  corrupt
Government m the voild     lie asited what was
the diileience between voting by billot ind sniei
noce      It  was  this    When an individual voted
trom his own  unbiased judgment, he  voted by
ballot      But if you  would have him operated on
by ti c dictation or influence of oihers, then let his
vote be viva voce     This was a question íelatirg
to the officers of the House, interesting only to lis
members, and  not to the peoole at larae     He
would be glad to know what the peopleof Illinois
knew or caied about the election of those oHceis
Mi   G   said he did not believe theie were ten
men in Illinois who knew who those oPiceis weie
How should they know whether iheCleik or the
Speaker of that House faithfully and pri mptly
dischaiged their respective duties'    It was not i i I
the nature of things     It was intended tnat by
voting vim voce, the voter should become depen
dunt, and not independent, as some of his fuends
seemed to suopose     It wis a fundamental pnn
ciple in our Government, that the vote by ballot
rendered  the voter independent, wntle the vote
vita voce rendered his subsetvient     It could not
be denied that theie would be less opportunity for
the free and unbiased exercise of the ] idgment of
the members in selecting their own officers when
they were biought up to face those who wielded
the power,   the influence, and the offices of the
Government, m giving  in   their  suffiages     He
asked if it was worthy of that House to 'husgive
an opportunity of renden lg its members liable to
such undue influence     TI p practice long put sued
of electing the officeis of the House, and of ¡e
electing them so lorg as  they  discharged then
duties with fidelity, had been found safe and satis-
factory, and the opeiation of the proposed chai ge
could only tend to render the officers so e e-teil,
the mere creature, the tool, the s i vile instrument,
of the mojo  ty or wh mhewasdei endant for hiss
I s ation     He trusted t^eie v as not a meml er (f
i that House, who wished to see their officers sei-
I vilely dependan on any n dividual member or
i any portio i of members    The design was not so
riuch to make members respe nsible lo the jeopie,
! as to a self constituted power surrounding them
| Here was the very evil of our (government, which,
I if not conected, and seduously guaided against,
I mus' event lally sap its foundations     Sn, (said
I Mi G ,) I will voteagatn«tany man who wnl dare
¡ to avow him&elf dependant alone on  the majority
I v ho aie to  elect him     He  would not, and he
I trusted the House would not, permit itself to sane
tion  h s dangeiuus nrinciole     Evei y thing in this
country v as loo! lrg towards this great evil, and
I should it continue to be countenanced, this Gov-
ernment could noi stand
I     Mr MILLER said, that 'ong before he had the
horoi of a seat in this House, his attention had
I been turned to the piesent rule, mder which the
i members vote by I allot for the ojjiceis of the House
lie bod always thought it wiong      He well recol-
lected A>nen at home among the people, in exam
ming the pioceedings of Congress in the papers,
the general  result of the election  could only be
seen     But the people could not ascertain from a
list of yeas and nays, how their own immediate
lepresentstue, nor how any other member had
voted     He also lecollected that one of his piede-
cessois (the late Mr   Ramsey) had, during his
teim, brought this subject beUie the House, by
moving a resolu ion veiy similai  to the one now
under consideration, ai -d having pi ecisely the same
object in view      He then  felt astonished that it
had not met with a moie favirable reception, as
he had always thought the proposed change so
leasonable in itself, that it was only necessary to
bring it to the no ice of the House to msuie ita
adoption     He thought there was a pecali ir fitnesc
and piopnety in the alteration of the rule as pi o
posed     It was due to the members themselves,
and it was also due to then constituents, that the
coange should be made    1 he present mode oi
voting is not only an unlesTved reflection upon
the  independence  of   members,   but  it   subjects
them, m  some instances, to  unjust i nputaiions
Tneu polities! of ponerts miy íepresent them as
having voted  foi   this  man  01   for that man foi
Speakei or public printer, so «is to injure them in
the estimation of their constituents, ar d there is no
journal, 01 published hot of yeas and nays, to put
che question to rest
I he Speaker of this House is one of the most
impol tan tend dignified officers in the Government
He occupies a die,tinguishedtaiid vei> elevated
1 osition in the eyes of the people of this nation
The people, therefore, have a right to know how
their repi ese itatives vote in his election, as well as
that of public printer, and the other officers of the
House
In the State which he had the honor to repre
s nt, in pfrt, the penj le vote by ballot themselves
This he thought right their vote¡> are their own,
and no one has a ngkl to inquire how they dis-
pose of them But it is not so with regard to their
íepiesentat ves So tenacious and careful had the
people of Pennsylvania been on this subject, that
they had made it a piovi ion in their constitution,
that all vo'es given nva repr sentative capacity,
snould be vita toce The representative gives the
vote of his constituents, and not his own, and con-
sequently they have a i ght to know how he does
give it This, as a general ru'e, cannot be suc-
ce=s'uiiy controverted in a representative govern-
ment And surely the case under consideration,
forms no exception
H" vvas no lif le astonished at the opposition to
the resolution by the gentleman from Kentucky,
[Mi Ha"di>t ] He represents a Sttte where the
neople themselves vote at the polls mva voce—an
intelligent and independent people, who prclaim
a'oud for whom they vo'e, and why should he, as
their represontative, wifh to put in >i secret ballot,
*or any officer of this House, in preference to
naming aloud the indiv dnsl foi whom he votes'
Certainly gentlemen who represe it those Slates
wheie the people themselves vote ma tore, will
