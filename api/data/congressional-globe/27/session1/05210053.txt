Marcii, 1841,"   But in  in  t,o¿/  et   he  report,
page 5th, the Secretary says ibt  sum was r#oeiv«d
by ihe puolic agei t last Oc ober.
Ag m if the expkna'ion a"rmp!ed of this con-
tradiction should be, that in the first instance Re
speaks ot its recipt in form into ihe Treasury by
covering warrants, between he l>t of January and
3d of ai-srci , ihen there is exposed another and
mate-rial error, because, on the same page, he says
it was. no' carried on the books till "the ith ef
March, 1841," ms ead of "between the Ut of
January, and 31 of March " The difference of a
day he-e i> e ery thing bitb politically and finan-
cia ly, becuna me Admm stration ended on Ihe
tend, and Ihe 0 her began on the fouitb, and ,f this
sum was carr ed on the bot ks, as it paid previously
to the 4 h, ard since ihe 1st of Januar>, it wmld
swell, and hai s-o'ien, the amount of expenditures
by the past Administration in fo first two nwn'hs
of this year, half a million of dollars while, on 'he
contrary, the Pe-reiary, in his exhibit of th^ re-
ceipt!  during those two nsonths in the body of his
repoit, bas 'orgotten te give the past'Adm nistra
tion and the Treisu'y any credit &r >his halt mil-
lion received from the Bank
Again if this expenditure is earned on the
books as ba 'ing been ma^e en the 4th, then ins,
or ought to be, included m his esumat of ihe fen
monihs' experdi are, and ¡s among the appropria-
tions ne esu rsate to be outstanding on the morning
ot the 4 >i of March.
Wh lo en tre contrary, he has omit'td m ihe
rece p s or ih^ ten m ir'ns, to credit ,1 s ng c do lr>r
ft the hi! millón leveled tiotn te i.ank.
