HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,August 24, 1864-3.40 p.m.

Brigadier-General MOTT,

Commanding Division, Second Corps:

General Ord reports that the troops mentioned in his previous report (about 5,000 in number, who threatened his front) are moving into Petersburg, apparently on the return to the north side of the Appomattox.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,August 24, 1864.

The order for the movement of troops is hereby countermanded.

By command of Brigadier-General Mott:

JOHN HANCOCK,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH CORPS,August 24, 1864-12.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

From our advance signal station we can see the lead-works, and the enemy's line of defenses, which are full of troops. There is only a picket-line visible outside. At W. P. Davis' house would be an excellent position to place a redoubt. Having done this we could safely proceed to establish our lines closer Petersburg, or make that the starting point in a movement on the Danville road. This house is just on the line which divides the slope toward Petersburg from that southward.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,August 24, 1864-12.30 p.m.

General HUMPHREYS:

I forward you the following:

SIGNAL STATION,

W. P. Davis' House- 12.30 p.m.

Colonel LOCKE:

The enemy have a large party at work upon a line about 600 yards south 20 degrees east of lead-works and extending east across the railroad. No other movement visible.

GEO. J. CLARKE,

Signal Officer.

The two boys confirm this. They say they are building a high fort in advance of the town and are afraid we will shell the town from our advanced position.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
