brigades under Brigadier-General Ransom, behaved most handsomely. The conduct of the sharpshooters of Gordon's corps, who led assault, deserves the highest commendation. This afternoon there was skirmishing on the right between the picket-lines, with varied success. At dark enemy held considerable portion of the line farthest in advance of our main works.

HEADQUARTERS,March 28, 1865. (Received 4 p.m.)

General Gordon informs me that in his report of the action at Hare's Hill, on the 25th instant, he omitted to mention that Colonel H. P. Jones, commanding the artillery, on that portion of the line, was at the front superintending in person the operations of the artillery, and that a select body of officers and men, under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Stribling, carried the enemy's breast-works will the sharpshooters of the corps, and immediately turned upon the enemy the captured guns.
