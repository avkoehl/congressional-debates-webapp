The Twenty-third Wisconsin, Colonel Guppey commanding, Ninety-sixth Ohio, Lieutenant- Colonel Brown commanding, Sixtieth Indiana, commanded by Captain Goelzer, and Seventeenth Ohio Battery, [Captain] Rice commanding, fought with the greatest desperation, holding the enemy in check for a considerable length of time, but for which our entire train with our artillery would have been captured. As it was, General Burbridge was enabled to bring off every wagon and all Government property, with the exception of one 10 pounder Parrott gun, which was captured just as it was crossing the bayou, the horses having been shot.

The bringing off of the section of Nims' battery, commanded by Lieutenant Marland, after the regiment sent to its support had surrendered, extorted the admiration of every beholder.

While the fight was proceeding, the Third Division came up on the double-quick, but by the time they had reached the middle of the prairie, and 1\2 miles from the scene of action, General Burbridge's command had been driven entirely out of the woods, while the rebel cavalry, in great force, charged through the narrow belt of timber on the left, and were coming down on his rear. By this time the Third Division had come within range, formed n line, and commenced shilling them, which immediately checked their farther advance, while General Burbridge, who had again gotten his guns into position, opened a raking cross-fire upon them, when the whole force of the enemy retreated to the cover of the woods. Our whole force was deployed in line of battle, and moved as rapidly as possible through the woods, driving the enemy out of it, who retreated rapidly. I moved the troops up on their line of retreat about 1\2 miles, while the cavalry pursued about 3 miles. My men having been brought up at a double-quick, were very much exhausted, and it was not possible to pursue farther.

Our losses are 26 killed, 124 wounded, and 566 missing.* The loss of the enemy in killed was about 60; number of wounded not known, as they carried all but 12 off the ground, but wounded officers who were taken prisoners represent the number of wounded as being very large. We took 65 prisoners.

Brigadier- General McGinnis, being very ill, was not able to be on the field. The troops of the division behaved admirably, under the command of Brigadier- General Cameron, of the First, and Colonel Slack, of the Second Brigade. The action of General Burbridge was gallant and judicious from the time I first saw him until the close of the engagement. The conduct of the Sixty-seventh Indiana Infantry was inexplicable, and their surrender can only be attributed to the incompetency or cowardice of the commanding officer. They had not a single man killed. Our mounted force, under Colonels Fonda and Robinson, though very small, behaved very handsomely.

I left at Carrion Crow Bayou, to hold that position, three regiments of the Third Division, viz, the Eleventh Indiana, Twenty-ninth Wisconsin, and Twenty-fourth Iowa, with one section of artillery. It was fortunate that I did so, for while the fight was proceeding with General Burbridge's command, Colonel [George W.] Baylor, of the First Texas Mounted Rifles [Second Regiment Arizona Brigade], swept around on our left, and attacked the camp at Carrion Crow Bayou, but they were driven off, with a loss of 3 killed. We lost none. I refer particularly to the report of General Burbridge for the names of those deserving honorable mention.
