General FERRERO:

Lieutenant-General Grant directs that you move your colored division alone to Dowdall's Tavern and Chancellorsville; a brigade at each place to cover our trains now assembling between those points. You will move by the turnpike and inform General Burnside that you have received this order. On reaching Dowdall's Tavern you will report by a staff officer to Major-General Sheridan, commanding Cavalry Corps, for further orders.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,Commanding Cavalry Corps:

I think it proper to inform you that the cavalry sent out on the plank road (Fifth New York and Second Ohio Cavalry) toward Germanna Ford, and to picket from there in the direction of the enemy, have reported no indication of the enemy within a mile of the plank road. Still the gap from the Sixth Corps to the river is open and should be watched.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, May 7, 1864-10.40 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

I sent a brigade of cavalry to fill up the gap mentioned in your note of this a.m. They turned off the pike at the Widow Jones' house and went around in your rear. Inasmuch as you have two regiments on the road already, will it be necessary for me to keep a whole brigade there?
