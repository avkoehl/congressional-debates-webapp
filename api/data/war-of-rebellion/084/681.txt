the river which are now guarded by petty detachments, liable to be picked up one by one. The Amite country is said to be rich in cattle and our patrols ought to supply the troops at Baton Rouge and New Orleans with beef. In a four-hours' examination of the Sixth Missouri Cavalry at drill I did not find a single officer in it who could countermarch a squadron or form line faced to the rear from column. I recommend that a board of examination be appointed for the officers and the ignorant and inefficient be discharged.

I desire to ask your attention to some special cases of absentees. The lieutenant-colonel of the Second Louisiana Cavalry, Woodrow, is on duty as assistant inspector-general on General Sherman's staff, in the Defenses of New Orleans. The regiment is a new one, has no colonel, and needs its lieutenant-colonel badly. Captain J. W. Porter, Second Louisiana Cavalry, is on duty in New Orleans in the provost-marshal's office, and should be with his company. Major G. W. Durgin, jr., of the Fourth Wisconsin Cavalry, is on duty as acting assistant adjutant-general to Brigadier-General Bailey at Morganza. His regimentis a large one and needs him to look after his battalion. Captain Foster, of the First Wisconsin Battery of horse artillery, on some duty in the city, should be with his battery. It is a fine one, serving with the division, and should not be allowed to get out of hand.

J. W. DAVIDSON,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
