RICHMOND, VA., April 23, 1862.

General LOVELL,

New Orleans, La.:

Confine the functions of your provost-marshals to subjects proper to military police. Revoke orders to banks to issue notes in conformity with views of provost-marshals, and leave all State institutions as far as possible undisturbed by military power.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

NEW ORLEANS, LA., April 23, 1862.

General S. COOPER:

Bombardment continued with unabated vigor; now five days and nights. We still hold out, with 4 casualties, but Fort Jackson much cut up. Want more powder, if if can be had.

M. LOVELL.

NEW ORLEANS, April 24, 1862.

General SAMUEL JONES:

The enemy has passed our forts. It is too late to send any guns here; they had better go to Vicksburg.

M. LOVELL.

RICHMOND, VA., April 24, 1862.

Gov. THOMAS O. MOORE,

New Orleans, La.:

I sent dispatch to General Lovell on receipt of yours in relation to the banks. From his reply find that orders were revoked.

Your dispatch in relation to enemy's ships this day received. I am hopeful that, whilst the forts divide the fleet, the Louisiana will not lose the opportunity, In painful anxiety wait further intelligence.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., April 24, 1862.

Gov. THOMAS O. MOORE,

New Orleans, La.:

We will take the coin of the banks and be responsible for it. The Secretary of the Treasury will take action immediately.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

RICHMOND, VA., April 25, 1862.

Major General MANSFIELD LOVELL,

New Orleans, La.:

It has been determined to burn all the cotton and tobacco, whether foreign or our own, to prevent it from falling into the hands of the enemy. You will therefore destroy it all, if necessary, to prevent them from getting it.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.
