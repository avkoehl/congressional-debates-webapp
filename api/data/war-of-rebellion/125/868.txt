The balance is deposited in my safe.

I have made no payments for transportation of any kind.

No vessels chartered or employed by me.

There has been in my employ in the Departments of West Virginia and Ohio up to June 30, 1864, a monthly average of forty persons in the capacity of managers, operators, repairers, &c.

I take pleasure in complimenting the employes of the military telegraph within this department for their promptness and reliability, and their devotion to the public interests, which they have so faithfully guarded in the satisfactory discharge of their respective duties.

It is estimated that at least 120,000 telegrams have been transmitted over the military telegraph lines within this department up to June 30, 1864.

I have the honor to state that the circular from the Quartermaster-General's Department, dated July 6, 1864, calling for this report was not received by me until October 28, 1864, which will account for the delay attending its rendition.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. G. LYNCH,

Captain, Assistant Quartermaster, and Asst. Supt.
