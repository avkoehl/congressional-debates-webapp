A small force of Forrest's men attacked one of my forage parties yesterday, but the scout at Washington drove them through that place. Five pieces of artillery and 900 men arrived at Blythe's the night before last.HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,Dunlap, August 23, 1863.

General VAN CLEVE,

Pikeville:

Minty's dispatch received. If he has fallen back in direction of Poe's Tavern on your orders or without orders, he has acted very imprudently and must return to watch the enemy, and if forced to retire must do so on Pikeville. If by this fatal step he cannot reoccupy his position he must in some way rejoin you without fatiguing his horses. Being on the ground you must act on the above by your own judgment, and always have in mind the exposed condition of your left.

Lieutenant Colonel LYNE STARLING,

Dunlap:

Your dispatch by signal received. Colonel Minty fell back toward Poe's on his own responsibility, not by my order, but no doubt found it absolutely necessary to save his command.

I am sending a dispatch to him with instructions in accordance with your order. I shall take care of my left.

Respectfully,

H. P. VAN CLEVE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Dunlap:

Your dispatches received. All you have done approved of. There are 20,000 rations at Tracy City, and more ordered. You had better send some of your trains to McMinnville, not to Tracy City. Send name of company, regiment, brigade, and division of corps to which prisoners you have taken along, to enable us to form some idea of number of enemy in that direction.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:
