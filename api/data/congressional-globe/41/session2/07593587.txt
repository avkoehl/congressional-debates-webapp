me tell you that they prefer to come in Ameri-
can vessels. I happen to know something
about that from my own experience. I was
interested in a line of steamers that did not
compare at all with the iron propellers now
running to Bremen and elsewhere. One of
(ho?e ships went over to Bremen and brought
back twelve hundred Germans, and alongside
that ship was lying a beautiful iron pro-
peller which you or I would certainly have
preferred; but these people preferred to take
the American ship ; they wanted to leave their
native country and go to the land of freedom
under the flag of their adopted country. We
found no difficulty in filling every ship of that
class with immigrant* ; and I here wish to have
published statistics of immigration from 1820 to
1869, which I trust will be carefully read by all:

FRANCIS A. WALKER,
Deputy Special Commissioner of the Revenue.
Now, sir, to pass to another point, we have
given to the world the finest clippers ever built.
We have furnished models to France and Eng-
land, and to the whole world; models of the
finest steamers and the fleetest sailing vessels
that ever floated. We have furnished Europe
j with improvements in rigging, improvements
I in capstans and windlasses, and in everything
on board ship that Yankee ingenuity could
invent to save labor and expense.
Before 1861 we built ships for England; we
built ships for France; we built ships for Aus-
tria—I suspect that we built ships for Hamburg,
I am not quite positive about that—but I know
we did for Italy. We gave her as fine a war
vessel as ever was constructed. It was built
in tny district at Mr. Webb's yard. France has
to-day one of her best gun-boats which was
built in this country and sold to France. Our
Government could not afford to pay the price
asked and the French Government took her;
they understand their business. We have built
ships not only for all these great nations of
Europe, but we have built them for all the
principal countries in the world. We have
built them for China, and there are to-day on
Chinese waters some of the finest steamers in
the world, which were built in the United States.
I wish now to say a word on the question of
mail service. We have no mail steamers. Our
mails are carried in foreign bottoms. They
are carried across the Atlantic in English,
French, and German steamers. Only a few
months since there was a question whether the
American mails could any longer be carried in
foreign steamers. It was a question whether
the Postmaster General would not have to
employ naval vessels to carry the mails, be-
cause we had no American steamers; but finally
there was an arrangement made to carry the
mails in foreign steamers. I should like to have
some gentlemen of this House stand on the
pier at New York about three or four o'clock
on some Saturday afternoon. They would see
a beautiful steamer backing out from the wharf
at Jersey City, firing her guns, while flying the
American flag at her fore peak. You would
ask, " What steamer is that ? Why, she flies
the American flag." " Oh, yes," I reply, " but
she is a Cunarder; she carries the United States
mails, and therefore she flies our flag." Then
you look up the stream,and outcomes another
ship firing her cannon. She, too, flies the
American flag. You ask, " What steamer is
that?" The answer is, "She belongs to the
French line, which France subsidizes to the
extent of millions every year." "Whydoes
she float the American flag?" " She also car-
ries our mails." Then from over at Hoboken
there comes another steamer firing her cannon,
and flying the American flag. Youask, "What
steamer is that?" I answer, "She. belongs
to the Bremen line, and carries our mails."
Any gentleman coming from a location distant
from our commercial centers might naturally
ask, " Have we no ships to carry our mails?
Can we not build our own ships?" "Yes,"
I answer, " we can build our own ships if Con-
gress will only legislate so as to put the ship-
builder in the same position in which he was
in 1861. That is all he asks."
Now, let me refer to the cause of the decline
of our carrying trade and ship-building. I do
not wish to dwell upon this question. Every
gentleman knows that everything entering into
the construction of a ship costs a great deal
more money now than it did in 1861. We ask
for such legislation as will reduce this cost.
During the war there was a demand upon our
ship-builders for the construction of vessels
for Government service, but at that time oc-
curred the transition from sail to steam, to
which my colleague [Mr. Wood] referred yes-
terday. Merchants found that by reason of
the quicker passage of steam vessels great
economy could be effected by using such ves-
sels instead of sailing vessels for the trans-
portation of the merchandise and products of
this country. At that period many of our ves-
sels passed under the English flag; and I say
let them stay there. They will do ns no good
if they come back. They cannot transport our
mails; they cannot compete with the iron pro-
pellers. Hence I say let them remain there.
As for any man who deserted the flag of our
country during our civil war, and preferred to
go under that of England, I say let him stay
there ; I have no particular desire to bring him
back; and though I say this, I do not belong
to that party which professes to possess par
excellence the loyalty and patriotism of the
nation.
Prior to 1861 all the commercial nations of
the world had begun to sse this change and to
adopt the propellers, the vessels with auxiliary
