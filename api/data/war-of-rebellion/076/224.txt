in his fortifications, and also in masses in front of us, his position covered by two intrenched lines of skirmishers. I think my batteries in Hooker's line, and perhaps Johnson's can reach the town; but the right being slightly refused to cover the flank the batteries posted there cannot. McCook will be on Davis's right and rear by sunset, if he has executed the orders given him, and we will push on, closing on the enemy, if he remains in his entrenchments, early to-morrow morning. We have taken some prisoners, but have had no serious fighting to-day.

The enemy is replying to our artillery fire with much spirit.

Yours, very respectfully,
