HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 3, 1865.

General MAURY:

We have been mortar-shelled all night, and there is some musketry at different points this morning. I never saw such digging as the enemy does. He is fast converting his advanced skirmish line into his main line. He is also erecting a heavy battery upon his extreme left and upon his extreme right flank. Can you spare me some picks? I would like to have 200 good negroes with tools to work. Every man of this force has been up all night. Be certain to send our supply of wooden embrasures, iron screens, and the heavy gun.

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.

(Same to General Liddell.)
HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 3, 1865-5.45 a. m.

General LIDDELL,

Blakely:

I am greatly disappointed that the boat did not return with heavy gun. Has any accident happened?

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 3, 1865-9 a. m.

General MAURY:

Is there no chance to get the gun-boat? Can I get 100 negroes with 50 axes and 50 picks?

R. L. GIBSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 3, 1865.

General LIDDELL:

I have four boats that will carry on an average twelve men with two oarsmen in each boat. Colonel Patton will report the number at Huger and Tracy.

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS,Spanish Fort, April 3, 1865.

Colonel GEORGE G. GARNER:

I am informed by Lieutenant Luzenberg, an officer right-wing defenses, Mobile, that he has more siege mortars than he needs. If any can be spared, they will be of great service to us, as the enemy is concentrating heavy mortars against us.

R. L. GIBSON.
