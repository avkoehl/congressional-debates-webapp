THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
December 12,
that committee. I mo.ve that we proceed to -the
election of the other standing committees of the
Senate.
The motion was agreed to.
. Mr. CASS. It has been usual latterly, on these
occasion^, by the unanimous consent of the Sen-
ate, to dispense with the vote by ballot. That
course expedites the business very much; and I
think it would be better if the Senate would eon-
sent to take that course now. I know that to do
so will require unanimous consent, and if any
gentleman insists on electing by ballot, it must be
done; but to try the question, 1 move to dispense
with so much of the rules as requires us to pro-
ceed by ballot in the choice of committees.
Mr. HALE. Let the rules be observed.
The PRESIDENT. Objection is made.
Mr. CASS. Then we must vote by ballot.
The PRESIDENT. Senators will prepare
their ballots for chairman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations, that being the first on the
list.
Mr. BRODHEAD. I ask for the reading of
the rule, which directs the mode of balloting for
committees.
The rale was read, as follows:
" 35. In the appointment of tlie standing committees, the
Senate will proceed, by ballot, severally to appoint the chair-
man of each committee, and then, by one ballot, the other
members necessary to complete the same; and a majority of
the whole number of votes given shall be necessaiy to the
choice of a chairman of a standing committee. All other
committees shall he appointed by ballot, and a plurality of
votes shall make a choice."
The PRESIDENT. The Chair* will inquire if
there be any objection on the part of Senators to
balloting for the chairmen of all the committees
on the same ballot? It would save a great deal
of time.
Mr. HALE. Follow the rule.
Mr. SUMNER. I think, Mr. President, we
had better follow the rule.
The PRESIDENT. The rule has been to
ballot for chairman of each committee first.
Mr: CASS. The ballots are prepared, and it
will be necessary for every gentleman now to cut
off the first name on each ballot that stands as
chairman. It would be better then to go on with
the same committee; otherwise we might not be
able to adhere precisely to the arrangement as to
the relation they boar to the committees.
The PRESIDENT. Senators then will pre-
pare their ballots, first, for chairman of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.
The ballots having been collected and canvassed,
the President announced that—
Mr. Mason had received 31 votes.
Mr. Clayton.
Mr. Seward....
Mr. Crittenden..
Mr. Hale 
Mr. liusk 
Mi. Wumner....
iltank 
Mr. Mason having received a majority of all
the votes given, was declared duly elected chair-
man of the Committee on Foreign Relations.
The PRESIDENT. Senators will now pre-
pare their ballots for the remaining members of
the Committee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. HALE. Mr. President, I think the rule
says that, in the appointment of the standing
committees, the Senate will proceed, by ballot,
seyeially, to appoint the chairman of each com-
mittee, and then, by one ballot, the other mem-
bers necessary to complete the same.
The PRESIDENT. Does the Senate prefer to
go on and name the chairmen first of all the com-
mittees ?
Jlr. HALE. That is the way the rule reads.
The PRESIDENT. The practice has been
otherwise, I am informed.
Mr. STUART. I think the construction of the
rule is as intimated from the Chair. The word
" severally" controls the whole act. You ballot,
in the first place, as to all the committees, first
for chairman, and then in one ballot for all the
rest of the committee.
The PRESIDENT. That has been the prac-
tice. Does the Senator from New Hampshire
appeal from the decision of the Chair?
Mr. HALE. No, sir.
The PRESIDENT. Senators will prepare their
ballots for the other members of the Committee
on Foreign Relations.

vassed, the President announced that—

The PRESIDENT. Mr. Douglas, Mr. Sli-
dell, Mr. Clayton, Mr. Weller, and Mr.
Fish, having received the greatest number of
votes given, are elected members of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations.
Mr. YULEE. Before proceeding to the next
ballot, I would ask, for the purpose of econo-
mizing time, whether it would not be in order to
move to dispense with the rule which requires
separate ballots, so that they may be taken alto-
gether?
Mr. BUTLER. They have refused that.
Mr. YULEE. Cannot that be done by a ma-
jority of the body ?
The PRESIDENT. The rule can only be
altered by unanimous consent.
Mr. BCJTLER. To alter a rule requires a
day's notice.
The PRESIDENT. A day's notice is re-
quired. Does the Senator from Florida submit
a motion?
Mr. YULEE. I submit the motion that the
rule be suspended?
The PRESIDENT. It will require unanimous
consent.
Mr. YULEE. I submit the motion for the
purpose of economizing time.
Hie PRESIDENT. The Chair hears no ob-
jection.
Mr. SUMNER. Will the Chair be good
enough to state the motion ?
The PRESIDENT. The Senator from Flor-
ida asks the unanimous consent of the Senate to
proceed to the election of the committees by one
ballot.
Mr. YULEE. My proposition is to dispense
with as much of the rule as requires a separate
vote for the chairman and the other members of
a committee, so that a vote may bo taken for the
whole of a committee at once.
The PRESIDENT. The Chair hears no objec-
tion to the motion.
_ Mr. HALE. I guess it will be bettor to go on,
sir, and vote. It will not save a great deal of
time.
Mr. YULEE. It would save half the time.
The PRESIDENT. Does the Senator from
New Hampshire object to the motion?
Mr. HALE. Yes, sir.
The PRESIDENT. Senators will proceed to
ballot for chairman of the Committee on Finance.
The ballots were collected, and while the Pres-
ident was canvassing them,
Mr. HAMLIN rose and said: I suggest for the
consideration of Senators that, while the Chair is
canvassing these votes, we may proceed to vote
for the body of the committee. This will be
equivalent to a saving of about one half the time.
The PRESIDENT. If there be no objection
Senators will go on and prepare their ballots for
the residue of the.members of the committee.
The canvassing having been completed, the
President announced that—
Mr. Hunter had received  34 votes.

Mr. BAYARD. It does not appear to me that
there is a quorum voting. It takes thirty-two
Senators to make a quorum.
The PRESIDENT. There is, doubtless, a
quorum present. Mr. Allen, Mr. Harlan,
Mr. Wilson, and Mr. Trumbull, having re-
ceived a majority of the votes cast, are elected
me'mbers of the Committee on Manufactures.
The votes for chairman of the Committee on
Agriculture having been canvassed, the result
was: >
Mr. Allen received 30 votes.

. The PRESIDENT. The result of this ballot-
ing does not show a quorum of Senators voting;
but there evidently is a quorum here.
Mr. STUART. There is certainly a quorum
present. If the pages who collect the ballots will
proceed again, they can obtain the votes of a
quorum.
The PRESIDENT. Senators present will
please vote.
Mr. HUNTER. The difficulty is that the last
vote shows no qiflrum. What is to be done in
that case ?
The PRESIDENT. We must take the vote
over again.
Mr. BRODHEAD. By common consent we
can allow those to vote who have not already
done so.
Air. RUSK. I move that Mr. Allen be de-
clared elected chairman of the Committee on
Agriculture. That can be done by unanimous
consent.
The PRESIDENT. The Chair will consider
the ballot as not closed, and Senators who have
not voted can have an opportunity of doing so.
Mr. CASS. What objection can there be to
sending the boxes round for the votes of those
Senators who have not voted?
The PRESIDENT. The Chair has ordered
that to be done.
