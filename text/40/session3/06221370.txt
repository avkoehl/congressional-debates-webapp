THE OOJSTGKESSION"AL GLOBE.
February 19,
appear, so far as I can perceive, for what In-
dians or what tribe that appropriation is made.
Mr. HARLAN. It is for an aggregation of
a number of bands of the Sioux Indiansâ€”ten
or fifteen bands. They are all Sioux,^ but
many of them are known by some additional
name. They are all located in different places
within the limits of the same general reserva-
tion, and the estimates have been 'made for
them by General Harney and by the Depart-
ment in the aggregate.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. My difficulty is
this: The bill now provides for the Blackfeet
band, for the Lower Brul6 band, for the Min-
neconjoux band, for the Oncpapa band, the
Ogallalla band, the Sans Arcs band, the Two
Kettles band, the Upper Yanctonnais band, and
the Yanctonnais band. There are nine bands
provided for. My inquiry of the Senator is,
* whether the treaty which he relies upon covers
all those bands of Indians; whether it is a
substitute for the provisions made for these
bands in the bill ?
Mr. HARLAN. Yes, sir; it is intended to
cover all the appropriations that have been
stricken out. Ifind, by referring to the treaty,
that the treaty has been executed by the dele-
gates from the Brulfo, the Ogallallas 
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. The Brul6s are
not in this.
Mr. HARLAN. They are included in the
appropriation, and are included in this treaty.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. They are not
included in what you are now striking out.
Mr. HARLAN. I think not.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. Then are the
Blackfeet included in that, treaty?
Mr. HARLAN. I understand they are. I
will proceed to read them, if the Senator
wishes.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. What I wish to
know is if all these bands that you propose to
strike out are provided for in the treaty?
Mr. IIARLAN. All that are stricken out
are provided for in the treaty and in the amend-
ment that has been sent to the desk.

and to assist them to locate in permanent abodes,
and to sustain themselves by the pursuits of civilized
lite, to be oxpended under the direction of the Sec-
retary of the Interior. $70,000.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. The bill con-
tains the same appropriation, I believe, that was
made last year. I think we had better not raise
that amount.
Mr. HARLAN. The committee thought it
ought to be raised, from all the information
they could get. There are thirty-five thousand
Indians in this Territory. There has been, we
believe, an excellent superintendent there, a
relative of the incoming President of the Uni-
ted States. From all the information that can
be had he has managed affairs there as well as
was possible with the small sum appropriated.
Seventy thousand dollars will be a very trivial
amount of money to provide for any consid-
erable proportion of those Indians. The white
people are encroaching in every direction, and
it did not seem possible to the committee to
make any decent provision that would proba-
bly induce them to keep the peace with a less
amount. That is all I have to say on the sub-
ject.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HARLAN. In line sixteen hundred
and seventy-nine I move to strike out "fifteen"
and insert " thirty," so as to make the appro-
priation for the general incidental expenses of
the Indian service in Idaho Territory, &c.,
$30,000.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine._ I think we may
get along with the appropriation as it is, unless
the Committee on Indian Affairs has more
definite information on the subject than I have.
This is the same appropriation that was made
last year; and I think if the Senator has no
special information on the subject we had bet-
ter allow it to stand.
Mr. HARLAN. The amendment of the
committee is above the estimate. The esti-
mate is for $20,000. The text of the bill is
for $15,000. The reason why the committee
recommended the increase to $30,000 is based
on facts derived from the Delegate of the Ter-
ritory, and from the Department also. Idaho
Territory is being rapidly settled up by miners,
and there are a number of strong bands of
Indians in the Territory who are unprovided
for by any treaty whatever, who, if they should
go to war with the white people, would involve
the Government in the expenditure of a very
large sum of money. It was thought by the
appropriation of this amount they might be
kept on terms of peace. If the Senator should
insist upon it, of course we shall not urge
anything above the estimates.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. I have no ob-
jection that the appropriation should be made
to conform to the estimates. I have a letter
here, written at the instance of the Delegate
from that Territory. I can very well under-
stand his solicitude that we should appropri-
ate as much money as possible to be expended
in the Territory. I dare say that the solicitude
on the part of the Delegate'is'a very proper
one ; but at the same iime the department, I
think, ought to be in possession perhaps of as
much information, and as reliable, as the
Delegate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the
Senator move to amend the amendment?
Mr, MORRILL, of Maine. Yes, sir; I move
to make it $20,000. That conforms to the es-
timates, and I think ought to be satisfactory.
Mr. CORBETT. There is a large number
of Indians in this Territory, with whom Gen-
eral Brook was fighting, who have been treated
with, and.have been taken to Idaho City, as I
understand, many of them, and turned over to
the superintendent of Indian affairs; that is,
the Governor of the Territory; but he has been
unable to make the necessary provision for
them. That is one reason, I believe, why this
estimate has been increased.
Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. My friend is
inaccurate about that. This is an appropria-
tion for incidental expenses, and has no refer-
ence to anything outside.
Mr. CORBETT. I do not state that any
of these treaties have been actually confirmed
here, but there have been treaties made that
have not been confirmed, and the Indians must
be taken care of until those treaties are form-
ally confirmed. There have been temporary
treaties made with them for peace.
_ Mr. MORRILL, of Maine. My proposition
gives all that the department estimate for.
