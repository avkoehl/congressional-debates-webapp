WASHINGTON, D. C., February 1, 1865-9.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

Let nothing which is transpiring change, hinder, or delay your miliary movements or plans.

A. LINCOLN.

CITY POINT, VA., February 1, 1865-12.30 p. m. (Received 2.20 p. m.)

President A. LINCOLN:

Your dispatch received. There will be no armistice in consequence of the presence of Mr. Stehpens and other within our lines. The troops are kept in readiness to move at the shortest notice, if occasion should justify it.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., February 1, 1865-10 p. m. (Via Fort Monroe, Va., 10.20 a. m. 2nd)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

In reply to the letters delivered by me to Messrs. Stephens, Campbell, and Hunter, they give a copy of their instructions form Jefferson Davis, which I think is a verbatim copy of that now in the President's possession. Am positive about the last two words, which differ from the ending of copy delivered by me, and to which the President called my particular attention. After giving object of conference, they add:

Our instructions contemplate a personal interview with President Lincoln at Washington, but with this explanation we are ready to meet any person or persons that President Lincoln may appoint at such place as he may designate. Our earnest desire is that a just and honorable peace may be agreed upon, and we are prepared to receive or to submit propositions which may possibly lead to the attainment of that end.

ALEX. H. STEPHENS.

R. M. T. HUNTER.

J. A. CAMPBELL.
