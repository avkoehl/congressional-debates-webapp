In my return you will find embraced the brigade of Brigadier-General Alcorn. His men are sixty-days' troops from Mississippi, who are armed with every variety of weapon. They are sick with measles, raw, and undisciplined. This brigade cannot be expected to be very effective.

I also send you a weekly report of the troops at this post*, and am sorry to remark that they have been much reduced by sickness.

My effective force is now, as you will see, only about 12,000.

I have the honor to be, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. POLK,

Major-General, Commanding.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Richmond, January 12, 1862.

General A. SIDNEY JOHNSTON, Bowling Green, Ky.:

SIR: I have the honor of acknowledging receipt of your letter of 5th instant.

I refrain from answering it in detail, because our views will be fully disclosed to Major General Earl Van Dorn, just assigned to the command of the Trans-Mississippi District, of your department, with orders to report to you in person on his way to the West.

He will give you information relative to the condition of the army of General McCulloch, and will of course receive your orders in relation to the movement of forces to New Madrid, as suggested in your letter.

Your obedient servant,

J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War.
