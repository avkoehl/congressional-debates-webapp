resources of this Administration in the way of
raising revenue.
The internal revenue tax has been reduced
as follows:
By act of July 13,1866  
By act of March 2, 1867     40,000.000
By act of February 3,1868  .  23,000,000
By acts of March 31 and July 20, 1869   45,000.000
By act of July 11, 1870   55.212,000
Net total reduction internal taxes  228,212,000
By act of July 14, 1870, the net decrease
of duties on imports  23,636,827
Aggregate annual decrease $251,84S,827
Notwithstanding this vast decrease of bur-
dens in the way of taxation by a skillful man-
agement of the resources of revenue, a faithful
collection thereof, and by economy in the pub-
lie expenditures, the public debt, as we have
seen, has been steadily reduced, all current
liabilities promptly discharged, all public im-
provements have been liberally provided for,
and public credit materially appreciated. In
the collection and disbursement of the public
revenue the Administration has fully met the
pledges that were made for it in the campaign
of 1868, which resulted in the election of the
present Chief Magistrate. It needs no higher
tribute to its wisdom, economy, .and fidelity
than these significant facts which we here
present.
I will now place in contrast the last years of
the last Democratic administration in some
matters of financial interest with the three
years during which General Grant has been at
the head of affairs. For the fiscal year 1858,
according to the report of the Secretary of the
Treasury of the receipts and expenditures of the
Government under Mr. Buchanan, the expend-
itures exceeded the receipts, $27,529,904;
in 1859, $15,584,511; 1860, $7,065,900; 1861,
to the close of his administration in March,
$10,054,655; making a total of $60,232,970,
which shows such miserable mismanagement
of public affairs that either the sources of
revenue had become so deranged as not to be
adequate to the demands of the Government,
or there was a reckless and extravagant waste
of the people's money. Under the present
Administration the receipts and expenditures
are as follows:

The estimated receipts and expenditures for
the year ending June 30, 1872, calculating on
the basis of what is already expended for this
year, will be as follows :
•r  $365,198,374 60
kxp nd>rure7.:'::.'. 92
Receipts over ""'"i^nditures  $.!.>95.001 63
Total receipts over expendituresduring three
years of this Administration, $256,403,681 25,
while for about the same period under Bu-
chanan the expenditures exceed the receipts
$60,232,970, making the difference in -favor
of this Administration $316,696,651; and dur-
ing its progress the people were never more
prosperous, and never better supplied gener-
ally with all the necessaries and comforts of
life.
Again, let us compare the fiscal year ending
June 30,1871, with the last year of Democratic
rule. We have estimated the expenditures of
that year in round numbers at $300,000,000,
instead of $292,000,000, as usually set down,
the difference arising from the fact that the
War Department was credited with $8,000.-
000 to which really it was not entitled. Of
this sum there was paid for expenditures
growing exclusively out of the late war, in-
cluding interest on the public debt, pensions
and bounties to soldiers, reimbursements of
States for expenses of volunteers, horses and
other property lost in the war, and sundry-
other items of magnitude, $175,543,140 27,
leaving a balancc of $124,456,860 to be ap-
plied to the ordinary expenses of Government.
Now, reduce this sum to agold basis, deduct
the increased Army and Navy expenses, and
allow for the immense growth of the country
in business relations, both home and foreign,
and in population, and it will be fonnd by an
easy calculation that the amount of expendi-
tures forthe ordinary purposes of Government
in 1871 was much less^er capita than in 1860
under Mr. Buchanan, when the total expendi-
tures were nearly sixty-five millions in gold in
a time of profound peace. One item more
and we shall be done with figures, and before
passing simply remark that the Democracy
have never been known to get ahead ki econ-
omy, and a careful and fauhful handling of
the people's money, as has been showi^ by
recent as well as more distant events. That
last item involving figures to which we refer
is this, and it shows how vastly superior is
the vigor and administrative ability of the
Republican party over that of the old starved
organization, which is looking so wistfully just
now toward the public crib: our war with
Mexico ' left upon us a debt of $68,000,000.
For more than ten years the Democratic party
kept pegging away on that debt, and then
abdicated, ieaving a debt upon the country of
$64,842,287 88.
Our public debt, created chiefly on account
of the late war, reached its maximum during
the last half of the year 1865. Since that time
we have reduced it $556,500,000, and all the
time the people have sustained with intelligent
cheerfulness the burden of taxation by which
this grand result has been achieved, and^ the
polity that has controlled the finances of the
counlry; and, without a peradventure, they
will, I believe, do it again. Now, sir, what
better thing can the people do than to con-
tinue an administration which has been so
singularly successful ? Against the general
results of the Administration I have heard no
serious complaints, only from the Democratic
party, from which it is needless to expect any-
thing else than complaints. It has become
their only stock in trade, and they must be
allowed to make the best of it.
There is no measure of any considerable
importance, or measure making more secure
the equal rights and privileges of all men in
this country, that does not receive a share of
their complaints ; no measure giving additional
assurance that the General Government pur-
poses to use all its constitutional powers to
guard and defend everywhere the peace and
safety of its subjects can escape their censure.
General acts to insure fair play at the ballot-
box and preserve the purity of elections thej|
have fought to the death. An extension ot
the jurisdiction of the Federal courts, in order
to make the liberty of the subject more secure,
arouses their fiery indignation, as though no
wrong could be perpetrated only by the Gen-
eral Government. And any form of an act to
enforce the provisions of the first section of the
fourteenth article of amendment to the Consti-
tution they cannot, by any possibility, quietly
submit to, as it might disturb and agitate or
abridge the privileges claimed by some of their
fneuds, who cooperate with them on election
days, of entering in disguise by moonlight or
starlight or without any light whatever, or any
authority of law, the premises of other Amer-
ican citizens to inflict, summary punishment
for opinion's sake. They seem utterly un-
mindful of the fact that these acts of the Gen-
eral Government can by no manner of means
conflict with any American citizen who pur-
poses to mind his own business and to abstain
from violating the rights of others, or from the
exercise of any privileges he is not himself
entitled to. Certainly the people are intel-
ligent enough to understand how much these
chronic complaints amount to.
The heaviest ordnance, however, both of
the common enemy and the disaffected of our
own household, are now trained upon the acts
and character of the Chief Magistrate himself,
with what motives by the latter we leave it
with the people of this country to determine.
They will decide these questions in their own
way and at the proper time, to the infinite
amazement and chagrin of all enemies. The
superior strength ot the tonress they are at-
tacking, and the suspicion of its strength, is
unmistakably manifested by the mode by which
they propose to approach and storm it. No
single organized f'oice, however distinguished
for recent battles fought and lost, considers
itsel ('adequate to the task. Hence, the earnest
and prevailing desire to secure a concerted
action of ail opposing forces.
Sir, you never expect to hear of harmony in
the realms of Pluto, so neither can you expect
harmony out of this heterogeneous mass of
perturbation. San Domingo would not win.
The eustoin-house frauds would not stick to
the man of destiny. The French arms case
is the greatest fizzle, over which numerous
windy speeches were made, that the world
ever knew before in connection with the pro-
ceedings of deliberative assemblies.
The remarkable utterances upon San Do-
mingo and the French arms question, particu-
larly gorgeous in eulogiums upon national
virtue, as though it were a thing but recently
discovered, and faintly appreciated only by a
few distinguished sapients, are among the most
uuique productions of this or any other age ;
and yet, judging from their effect upon the
public mind and the facility with which they
vanish into tliiu air, we might say that if those
philippics constituted the only hope their au-
thor had of immortality they might reason-
ably expect ere long to be laid away with the
common herd of forgotten dead.
Charges were made about the time that it
appeared that certain distinguished parties
had failed to bave their wishes complied
with in some other directions, that possibly
there was something rotten in connection with
the San Domingo annexation scheme, and no
charges could possibly have been more ground-
less, except perhaps those of the French arms
case. Briefly, what are the facts in relation
to that annexation scheme?
It should not be forgotten that it. did not
originate with the President ot the United
States. The matter was considered during
the last session of the Fortieth Congress, and
before General Grant was inaugurated by the
committee of this House on foreign rela-
tions, and met with so much favor that one
of the most distinguished members ot that
committee, Judge Ortii, of Indiana, made a
strong speech oil this floor advocating the pro-
timA H.frp.r thf? inauguration, the
ieet. Some time after the inauguration,
Government of Dominica, having thus been
encouraged, sent an agent to this Government
to propose terms of annexation, to be consid-
ered at as e^rly a day as poSbible. This agent
