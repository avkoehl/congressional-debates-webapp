Improvement of the Western waters—Mr. T. Smith.
H. of Reps.
boat city—for St. Louis is, probably, the greatest
steamboat city on the globe; and, sir, I know of no
city that ever rose from beneath mountain-loads of
commercial disasters with more buoyancy, or with
a more undaunted courage and spirit, than did St.
Louis on the occasion to which I allude.
Since that disastrous period, losses, though great
and frequent, have not been so severe—probably
not much greater'than the commercial losses of all
the rest of the nation added together. But the losses
are still far heavier than we can endure, and the de-
struction of life greater than we are disposed to tol-
erate. The steam navigation of the western rivers
has called for a larger expenditure of human life
than has the defence of all the American war ships
since the establishment of the American navy.
Aaflfest the continuance of this demand for the sac-
rinc?of the lives of valuable citizens in order to sus-
tain a commerce, without the continuance of which
we cannot exist as a people, we solemnly protest.
We ask, as a matter of justice, for such improve-
ments as shall maintain our commercial marine in
all its vigor, and yet render the sacrifice of the lives
of our citizens unnecessary: and this measure, we
think, is most reasonable, as well as just. The
commerce of America—not of the East, not of the
Gulf of Mexico, nor yet of the West, nor of the
great lakes of the extended North, but American
commerce, wherever found, inland, foreign, or
coastwise—should be equally, should be manfully,
and thoroughly guarded from every danger, natural
or artificial; for, sir, commerce, in its most extended
sense, is the life-blood of every enlightened and civ-
ilized community. Its welfare is provided for in
the constitution itself, in general and comprehensive
terms. Not the foreign, not the coastwise, not the
inland commerce of the country, but commerce in
its most extensive, and in its common, unrestricted,
universal sense, as understood in 1787, was to be so
"regulated" as to make it most conducive to the
"common good and general welfare," not of the
people of Massachusetts Bay, and of the colony of
Lord Baltimore, but of the people of the United
States.
Sir, the people of the West feel that they have
proudly, in a spirit of patriotism, and of wise fore-
cast, done their duty towards the prosperous people
inhabiting the towns, villages, cities, and States bor-
dering upon the Atlantic. Appropriations, in a
spirit'of ungrudging liberality, year after year, have
been voted by their representatives, until spacious
harbors, fine roads, and noble fleets have been pro-
vided for in a manner, and to an extent, that does
honor to the American name.
The great commercial marts that adorn almost
every harbor, road, and inlet, from the mouth of the
St. John to the capes of Florida, are fortified in ac-
cordance with the most approved rules of military
art, and are further protected by a navy of the most
exalted character for activity and conduct. From
these prosperous cities diverge innumerable canals,
rail, turnpike, and other roads, affording not only
fvery desirable commercial facility of approach, but
of military also. Blessed with commercial, man-
ufacturing, and agricultural advantages unequalled
by those of any one of the empires of the earth; fa-
vored by the government with naval and military
defences of a most respectable order of merit; and
provided with a multitude of the best and various
kinds of avenues to the highly cultivated and dense-
ly populated country in the rear,—we ask, having pa-
tiently waited for the accomplishment of all this, that
the members of the government, from this highly fa-
vored region, shall now turn their attention to the suf-
fering commerce of the interior- Wc ask but little,
but ask that the pittance may be promptly ijiabufasd,
for our wants are urgent. A few hundred thousands
now, a few millions in all, will answer our highest
expectations.
The money expended, from 1791 to 1840, both
inclusive, was—
Upon the naval establishment, - §155,308,873 89
Upon fortifications, arsenals, arm-
ories, for services, ordnance, in-
ternal improvements, &c. ~ - 263,459,241 56
For foreign intercourse - - - 3*1,138,620 48
Upon miscellaneous objects - - 53,160,459 53
Total expenditures for above
objects - §506,067,195 46
To build up a navy, and to maintain an amicable
intercourse with foreign nations—both objects being
exclusively for the benefit of foreign and of coastwise
comnjerce—have cost this nation, from 179} to 1840,
{he enormous sum of one hundred and eighty-nine
million four hundred and forty-seven thousand
four hundred and ninety-four dollars and thirty-sev-
en cents [|189,447,494 37!]
The whole sum of money raised by Congress,
from 1791 to 1840, was #1,112,076,586 33. Of this
vast sum $436,700,648 23 were expended in pay-
ment of the public debt, as at different times and for
different purposes created. No less than $506,067,-
195 46, were expended to encourage commerce, to
build forts and fortifications, and for internal im-
provements, &c. Unite the sum paid to liquidate
the public debt, with the sum paid out to build a
navy and maintain commercial agents in foreign
countries to promote commerce, and to build forts,
&c., to protect what has thus been obtained, and.we
have the immense sum of $942,767,843 69, that has
been expended almost wholly and entirely in the
Atlantic and gulf of Mexico States. This leaves
$169,308,742 64 that have been expended to keep
up the government during forty-nine years.
Down to as late a period as the year 1801, the
first year of Mr. Jefferson's administration, the
whole expenditure, under the head of civil list, was
only #549,288 31. In 1837, it had increased to
$2,357,035 94; in 1840, it was $2,736,769 31. In
1791, under General Washington, the cost of the
whole foreign intercourse was only $14,733 23; in
1824, the first year of John Gluiney Adams's admin-
istration, the cost was $5,140^,099 83; in 1837, the
first year of the administration of Mr. Van Buren,
the cost was $4,603,905 40. The reason of this
astonishing increase of cost, from fourteen thousand
dollars, to five millions of dollars, is obvious; it is
the same reason that sent Caleb Cushing to the antip-
odes, not to prevent war—not to preserve peace
with the Chinese—but to encourage and promote
foreign commerce. To encourage foreign com-
merce, the increase of the cost of our naval estab-
lishment from $61, 408 97, (which it was in 1794,
the middle of Washington's administration,) to
$6,113,896 89 in 1840, and to $9,000,000 in 1844,
has been effected exclusively by the commercial in-
terest. Until 1811, the navy seldom cost as high as
$2,000,000 a year. During the whole of the Jack-
son administration the cost but once reached $4,000,-
000 per year. For eight years together, beginning
in 1828, the expenditures were three millions and a
fraction of dollars; in time of profound peace, it
has doubled!
To show still further how ready the West has
ever been to encourage the foreign and coast-
wise commerce of the Atlantic States, and thus de-
monstrate the propriety and justice of our claim to
reciprocity, I would call attention to the following
sums that our western representatives have cheer-
fully acquiesced in the bestowal of, for the express
and sole purpose of building up the ocean fisheries,
&c. Direct bounties have, by the West, been voted
to be paid out of the national treasury annually, to
foster an eastern interest, by our eastern friends
deemed important:

Note.—Fishing vessels employed on the westerfl
Waters are nor entitled to allowances,
A slight examination of the table shows that the
policy is not a recent policy, nsr a temporary one.
The sums paid are large, as will be perceived by
adding together the payments of each year for each
object. The sums paid since 1821, out of the com-
mon treasury, to owners of fishing vessels, mostly citi-
zens of Massachusetts, form an aggregate larger
than all of the expenditures in the western States,
for improvements of all kinds, since their admis-
sion into the Union. *
Few of the western people know that Congress,
for twenty years past, has annually allowed, on an
average, more than $230,000 as a gratuity—a gift—
to certain fishermen. In 1841, the actual appropri-
ation made by Congress to keep up the lights in the
light-houses scattered along the coast, was no less a
sum than $472,822,41! Add to this sum the amount
of bounties, and of allowances to fishermen, during
that same year, and we have the snug sum of $832,-
722,82 given to the fishermen and to light-house
keepers: for western rivers, the same year, the sum
of $100,000! Having quietly borne with such
monstrous inequalities in the dispensation of the
public treasure, and until every part of the coast Is
perfectly illuminated, the fisheries established, twelve-
hundred-thousand-dollar custom-houses erected, and
every vulnerable point on *our Atlantic fojgified,
is it xinreasonable conduct in western members to in-
sist upon having the western rivers allowed a fish-
erman's share, when the public treasure is being al-
lotted to the several claimants therefor?
Fears have been expressed that the West, when
it obtains the power in 1850, will deal unjustly by
the East. This fear is entirely unfounded. The
West will be influenced by the same elevated, just,
impartial, and disinterested" views that governed our
eastern friends in 1841, when appropriating $6,774,-
405 42 for the navy, $268,177 for foreign inter-
course, $278,000 for fortifications, $472,822 41 for
light-houses, $359,900 41 for fishing vessels—in all,
the moderate and insignificant sum of $8,153,345 83
for the protection of eastern commerce; and for the
protection and encouragement of western commer-
cial interests they appropriated the large and adequate
sum of §100,000! Such examples, if generously
and perseveringly followed up until 1850, will be
ample guaranties of the future good conduct of
western members! Such generosity—such rare
magnanimity, exhibited during a long course of
years—will have a moral force, in this moral age of
the world, at once beautiful in theory, and perfectly
delightful in practice!
But, sir, it is said the West pays but an inconsid-
erable portion of the taxes or revenues that go into
the treasury. This is a grave charge, and should be
carefully examined. This subject is so difficult to
treat, and the results are arrived at with so little cer-
tainty, that little but assertion has been dealt in, ir\
relation thereto. One thing may be assumed as a
certainty; and from that fact we may reason. The
commerce of the western waters exceeds the -cash
value of two hundred and thirty-five millions of dol-
lars per year. It becomes a matter of much inter-
est, if we would know what amount of revenue is
paid by the West into the national treasury, to as-
certain what proportion of that commerce of two
liundrejl find thirty-five millions is exports, and what
proportion thereof is imports. We manufacture in the
western States but few, and use many fabrics and ar-
ticles of all kinds and qualities generally consumed in
civilized communities. For many years the West
has purchased more than it has sold, as is abundant-
ly proved by the heavy rates of exchange uniform-
ly against the West. Increased exports, and great-
ly increased manufactures have, within the last two
years, brouaifcdown the rates of exchange nearly
to par; a st<8lry increase of both, for a couple or
three years, will turn the already wavering balance
in our favor. But it is now against us. It is believed
to be safe to assume, therefore, that the imports into
the West, for 1843, were, at the least, $120,000,000.
These imports are mostly from the Atlantic cities;
an inconsiderable quantity is direct from the West
Indies, the Pacific, Europe, &c. Our imports into
the West, from all quarters, amount to a larger sum
than the sum of the values of all imports into the
United States from foreign countries. If so, no por-
tion of the nation pays a larger share of the revenue
than the West. To prove this, and to show that
the commerce of the West (§235,000,000) exceeds
in value the value of all articles brought to or ex-
ported from the United States; and to show the
amount of revenue imports yield to the treasury,
and what it costs to collect that revenue, I refer tg
the following carefully-compiled official table;
