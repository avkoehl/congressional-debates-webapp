Enemy very busy all day on fort southeast of white house; also digging on work west-north west from this point. Rather more teams visible than usual on the different roads leading south from the city, but moving irregularly and in small squads. Two caissons moved from the city about 7 a. m., disappearing in woods near Farley's house. nothing has been seen to indicate the movement of any considerable body inside the enemy's line to-day. Dense smokes west and north of city make close observation difficult.
