February 28.- There are about 15,000 troops coming between Berwick Bay and Franklin and crossing together. One gun-boat has already arrived at Franklin. They will move up in the course of a week, if not sooner. This you can rely upon.

I would respectfully request instructions in regard to the bridge at Washington, in the event of my command falling back at and beyond that point, as to whether it shall be destroyed. It will be finished the latter portion of this week.

Very respectfully, major, your obedient servant,

WM. G. VINCENT.
