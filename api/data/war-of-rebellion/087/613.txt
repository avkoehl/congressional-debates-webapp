a force of the enemy's cavalry, with two pieces of artillery, opposed my advance. The detention was of very short duration, the enemy having been driven toward the Nottoway. At dark my command was halted at Coman's Well to feed the horses. Late in the evening I camped near the infantry, and about three miles from Sussex Court-House. On the 11th my command passed the infantry, on the south side of the Nottoway, crossed the pontoon bridge, and, marching in rear of Potter's division, of the Ninth Army Corps, arrived in camp at 1 a. m. on the 12th.

In these operation all my orders were executed by my command with great cheerfulness and promptness. Wherever our enemy was met he was driven away. During the very severe snow-storm on the night of the 9th my men and horses suffered considerably.

My brigade commanders are deserving of particular commendation for their energy and activity in discharge of their duties. The officers of my staff performed the arduous duties required of them with promptness and zeal.

The loss in this division was 2 officers killed, 4 wounded, 3 missing; 15 enlisted men killed, 61 wounded, and 53 missing (of these, 33 men of the Second New York Mounted Rifles, a newly mounted regiment, before mentioned as having been detached).

In mentioning the loss of Major Sergeant, commanding First Massachusetts Cavalry, killed at the head of his regiment, I would

attest his great excellence as an officer, and his recognized virtue as a gentleman. After three years' faithful service he died in the cause to which he was so particularly devoted.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. McM. GREGG,

Bvt. Major General, U. S. Vols., Commanding Second Cavalry Division.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fifth Army Corps.
