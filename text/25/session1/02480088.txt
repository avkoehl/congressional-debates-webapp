25th CowG....lst Sess.
Postponement of fourth imlalmeij_—Mr. HoLey.
H. of Reps.
that m the election of public printer to the House
of Representatives, tuc votes, of the members shall
be n ven viva voce In thia simple p oposition, no
charge, either d rectly or indirect}, wa^ made
touching the >nv:„ics of any gen'leman Mr B
sa'd the pioposition he had sub mttcd to the House
was not a not el one It was m s'rict accordance
with the true pr.nuples of republicanism, and he
wished to know the gentleman, if such a one there
should be m th s House, tvho stood opposed to a
full exposition oí all his pubhc acts be ng made
known to his immediate constituents and the coun-
tiy at urge Mr B was not oniy m favor of the
viva voce prmciple being applied in the election of
public pr nter, but like the gentleman irom Virgi-
nia (Mi Patton) he was in favor of extending the
same p nciple in the election of all fie officeis of
the House. These weie questions on whit h ihe
votes of each member should be given in such a
manner as to leave no doubt as to how, or for
whom, he did vote
The people aie ever jealous of their rights, and,
who, I would ash, will deny their right to knou
hj>v f-air lemevntatives vote on all questions, as
v ell in ihc election of public printer, and all other
officers ot the House of Representatives, as on
o'her quest ons connected with tnen public duties
Why should a pari of the public acts of the peo-
ple'  repusf natives be conducted in a pubhc man-
ner, and part thereof be conducted in a uciet man-
ner? Such a piactiee Mr B considered anli-
rep ibhcin, and at variance with piofe^sions made
by gentlemen on the floor of the House of Repre-
sentative-, who are in the habit of dec'amnng in
fxvorofthe ug'nts ot their constituents Mr. B
•■aid that he had not iisen to make a speech, his
only object \v is bncfly to exp is--, m a very woids,
his pi í c n in n oi Ini piopus tion which he
hid submitted to the House, and being des ous to
know who, and how mary gentlemen were op-
posed to the resolution by him submitted, he would
conclude by asking tnat the question be taken by
ayes and nays

Gov ei p in! to fulfil the expectdt ons of the States
t untVd iron ihe depesits act oí 1836   1 dent fte
obligation. I can safely appeal to the v irtue and
intelligence of the people, and ask whether fifi'
desire fot Stale purposes the money collected by
ti s Goieinment, when it is necessaty for Fede"1'
purposes ? Is th • fund necessary to meet the iMn.!s
of the Goveinrient i This is the question Lel
us refer to the report of the Secretary. This re-
port has been condemned bj tht opponents of the
bill as mysterious and incomprehensible Be this
as it may as to the details, the aggregate of means
and liabilities is set down so plamlv that " he who
runs may read "
The amount of means in the Treasury foi the
current year, in round numbers, is twen'y-six mil-
lions of dollars, exclusive of the nine millions due
under the fourth instalment, and which is not a part
of the income of the present j ear The amount of
expenditure, by virtue of appropuations, is th rty-
tvvo millions, leaving a balance of six millions
agnrstthe Treasuiy, or a deficit to that amount
This debt of sit millions cannot he paid except by
a resort to the fourth instalment, or to those trans-
fer wbuh have already been made with the States
Shah tt e giv e them the fourth n staunent m the left
hand, and draw from them vith the nght,underthe
piovisions of the deposite act" It is more easy to de-
posite mo ey with the States than to collect it from
them Sir, the process of col'ecti n will be fiaught
with delays, dangers,co'hsions be tween th two Go-
vernments^ hich will leave the Tieasurv. totally un-
able to pay the appropuations If is ahendy announ-
ced in this hall th it the deposites vvifh the States are
a gift to them Many ot the States hat e made per-
manent investments of this fund Some have de-
posited it with banks, to be loaned to the people
All will 'eel reluctant to return 't. If we might
judge from the tone of debite, some of the States
wou'd, s their reoroseuatnes have done, attemot
to "aiguMhe seal ii mi tne bond," and pio e he
loan to be a gilt The difficulty is mhe.ent m the
nature of demands upon political bodies, the same
which existed under the Confederation Some
will refuse to pay under colorable pretexts, and
none will pay without all will pay We must,
therefore, discard the idea of diavving upon the
Sutes fot the funds already on deposite with them
The only expedient left is to ariest the nine mil-
lions due under the last instalment. This amount
in the deposite banks will not, m ah probability,
cancel the debt of six millions Indeed, the gene-
ral and sign il failure oí those institutions to com-
ply with then engagements lenders it doubtful
whether any considerable portion of it can be col-
lected But as far as this iund can go to defray
the expenses of the Government it should go It
is not legitimate to diveit it to an} other object
But six millions of excess of expenditure is a
mm Muía point, one to which all will, and, I be-
lieve, have agieed
But the honor of our arms must be sustained m
1 londa, and its bleeding inhabitants protected
against then sav age em mies One million and a
half ol dolíais is estimated fin tins puipose during
the piesent\eii flicpiesent session of Gongies 
xvill cost half a nulhon These two amounts aie
not put dow n ¡n tne lepnrl, and increase the excess
to ei-tht millions If to this you adu four millions
at the end of the veai, foi the use of the Mint, and
contin-ri nt calls upon the Treasury, yon h i.e an
excess oí expenditure and habilitie, amounting to
tvvclvi millions u, uollars Can any gentleman
equalize the income and expenditure ot the present
jet'1 Will he stnkca balance between the nu.dtis
and hab libe, oi the Treasury' The gentleman
from Ti incsse1 (V[r Bell) lies indeed discovered a
new and sniguln method >' itplemshmg an ex-
hausted Ticisun—bv considering the money m
the hands of di'-buis-mg officers (five millions) as
an increase oí the mea is ot the Tieasurv bej-ond
the lfinis rhead} ennneiat"d n the Sccutai} \
íeport I am s, prised thn a gentleman of his
expei ence m financial matfei a should ¡all into sucn
an error At th., commencement of the toar the
Secretary, being lequired to ci'cuhte the amount
m the Treasury, found foi tv two millions remaining
after reducing t ie outstanding appropriations to
sixteen millions. The monev then hi me hands of
disbursing officers «as th> a jumH conswied as
money pud out of the Tieasurv md reduced the
outstanding appropuations piecisch   that amount,
which otherwise would have been twenty-one mil-
lions, supposing hte millions to have been m their
hands. Of the fony-two millions, there are nine
millions remaining for deposite tv th the States, five
millions reseived, one million six hundred and sev-
enty thousand leceived from banks, and twenty
millions fiom lands and customs.
The account will then stand thus-
Means—
Remainder of the surplus      -             -   $9,000,000
Reserved for use of Mint, and on 1st
January last           -                                  5,000,000
Returned from banks             -             -     1,670,000
Prom lands and customs       -             -   20,000,000
Making an aggregate of    -
Liabilities—
Fouith instalment to the States
Appropriations for 1837
-  $35,670,000
-       9,000,000
-     32,733,000
Making an aggiegate of    -             -$41,733,000
Tne excess in round numbeis is six millions of
dollars Now, the argument of the gentleman from
Tennessee would add the five millions m the hands
of disbursing officers to the means of the Treasury
aheady enumerated, and increa o them to forty
millions But all the possible sources of revenue
h-ive already been placed in the account, and the
monej in the hands of disbursing others, instead
of swfILng the amount, onlv shows tvheie tí is. As
vv ed might the gentleman add to the means of the
Tieasuijr the ttinds in the hands of collectors, re-
ceivers, and the officeis of the Mint, and the whole
amount to the credit of die Treasurer m the depo-
site banks Tht truth is, that the aggregate means
of the Treasury is one thing, and the manner in
which they are kept oi disbursed is another. The
one gives you the whole amount of revenue; the
of íei tell  koto %l is duposed But the gentleman
from Tennessee complains of the extravagant ex-
penditure of thn ty-tw o millions for the present year.
He has been requested by the gentleman from
South Caiolma (Mr Pickens) to bring m his bill to
repeal the objectionable items. The request is rea-
sonable. Does the gentleman from Tennessee ex-
pect, by a geneial denunciation ot those appropria-
tions, to alter the data upon which the income and
expendituie of the Government aie founded, and
thereby to lessen the acknowledged deficit of six
millions'! The Secretary of the Treasury, in
obedience to a call fiom the House, has already
stated that an exact and scrupulous investigation
has been made in relation to such appropriations,
the execution of which might, consistently with
the public interests, be deferred until the ensuing
yeai, and that the amount thus deferred it> fifteen
or sixteen millions of dollars, leaving the necessary
and indispensable expenditures of ihe piesent year,
as staled in his íeport, thnty-two millions, and the
outstanding appicprmtions sixteen millions.
It has aheady been shown by the gentleman
from North Carolina (Mr McKay) that the in-
creased amount of expenditure for the present year
is owing mainly to extraordmaiy, but necessary,
objects of appiopnation such as the Florida war,
the iiicr->asp of the pension list, and the execution
of treaties null vai ous tribes of Indians, among
winch is i ire nv with the Cnerobees which will
piobablv demand, within the present teai, one
million of doll? i s The gentleman from Penns)l-
vaua(Mr Biddie) has taken occasion to strike
this item fiom the list, upon the giound that it was
appiopi atedfoi the last notthe present vear Why,
sii, does not t! at gentleman perceive that it matteis
not liken the appiopnation was made, so far as the
argument is concerned It is not the tune of appio-
¡nialton, but of evpendUure The acpiopr.ations
may have been made one, two, or font years back,
but if their execution fall upon the present year,
the) are properly chargeable to it The gentleman
fiom Tennessee, w ho, on this occasion, stands forth
the advocate of retrenchment, w ill not reduce even
the bas.s of calculation, until he can lay his finger
upon the it ins, and embody them in the form of a
bil', loi their ¡epeal Vague surmises of prodi-
gality m an administration are at all times msuffi-
eent as a basis of legislative action the} are pe-
c iliarlv so aftei ' an evict and scrupulous investi-
garon" into ibjects that may be dispensed with by
the ofbeer chaiged with the inquiry.   Much, then,
