known as the States of Virginia, North Carolina,
, South Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Alabama, Missis-
sippi, Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas, were left
without civii governments upon the overthrow of said
armed rebellion; second, that the pretended govern-
mentssince set up therein throusrhtbemilitary inter-
ference of the President of the United States, are de
facto governments of military origin, without civil
foundations, and are not valid Stats governments
under the Constitution of the United States and
could only become such, if at all, by being so recog-
nized and declared by Congress in due form of law.
The joint resolution was read a first and
second time.
Mr. BAKER. I ask that this joint resolu-
tion be referred to the Committee on the Judi-
ciary, unless the Speaker shall decide it must
go under the rale to the joint select Commit-
tee on Reconstruction..
The SPEAKER. The resolution can be re-
ferred to the Committee on the Judiciary, and ,
will be so referred.
Mr. FINCK. I rise to a question of order;
the resolution cannot be referred without the
question being put to the House.
The SPEAKER. The rule requires its ref-
erence without debate. ,
Mr. FINCK. Without a vote ? Is not the
House to judge whether, a resolution shall be
referred or not ?
The SPEAKER. By the rule it must be
referred.
Mr. FINCK. Is a motion to lay upon the
table in order ?
The SPEAKER. Not under the rule. If
the gentleman prefers another committee he
can make that motion.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I rose to a question of
order at the same time that the gentleman from
Ohio [Mr. Fixck] did, inteudingto askwhether
this joint resolution did not go to the Com-
mittee on Reconstruction.
The SPEAKER. The Chair examined it
and thought not, as it did not refer even- indi-
rectly to the question of the representation of
the so-called confederate States, and the rule
of the House is that all papers relating to the
representation of the so-called confederate
States shall be referred to the joint Committee
on Reconstruction without debate.
AMENDMENT OF THE CONSTITUTION.
Mr. BROMWELL. .1 ask leave to offer a
jxiint resolution declaring thepower of amend-
ing the Constitution, and I ask that it be read.
The joint resolution was read, and is as fol-
lows :
Be it resolved by the Senate and House of Represent-
atives of the United States of America in Congress
assembled. That whereas the Constitution of tho
United States provides that Congress, whenever two
tbirds of both Houses shall deem it necessary, shall
propose amendments to the Constitution which,
when ratified by the Legislatures of three fourths of
the States, shall be valid to all intents and purposes
as part of the said Constitution; and whereas the
number of the States lawfully entitled to represent-
ation in the Congress of the United States is twenty-
six; and whereas the several States of Virginia,
North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,
Mississippi, Alabama, Louisiana, Arkansas, and
Texas did attempt, by acts of secession from the
Union and by confederating with each other, to form
a separate government foreign to the United States,
and by war upon the Government of tho United
States to wholly separate themselves severally and
collectively from the United States, and did openly
by such acts of secession, confederation, and war
deny all allegiance to the Government of the United
States, and did by their several Legislatures and by
their several conventions called for that purpose,
and by their several Governors and by their judici-
aries, and by the ratification of their people respect-
ively, eDgagein a common cause to wholly subvert the
power and authority of the United States through-
out all their several limits; and did by their Gov-
ernors, Legislatures, and people make war against
the United States, and continue said war, acting as
a belligerent power, until finally overthrown as such
power by the military force of the United States m
open war, and by that means only did take undis-
puted possession of the territory embraced in said
several States, and has from thence bitherto main-
tained and still maintains military occupation of said
territory; and whereas by means of the premises
the said several States were left at the close of said
war without civil government, and no governments
have as yet been formed in any of said States by or
with the consent of Congress; and whereas, to par-
ticipate in altering or amending the Constitution of
the Union can only be done by States of the Union,
and is the discharge of the highest function possible
in a State of the Unionâ€”a function derived wholly
from its status in tho Union: Therefore,
Resolved, That in ratifying amendments to the
Constitution of the United States, as well thdsenow
pending as those which may hereafter be proposed
by Congress, the said several States are not entitled
to any vote, and aro wholly incapable either of ac-
cepting or rejecting any such amendment, so as to
bind thereby the loyal States of the union, until
they shall severally be restored-to their'former rela-
tion to the Union, in full power and competency as
States of tho Union, by consent of the Tainted States
through the Congress thereof; and that when any
