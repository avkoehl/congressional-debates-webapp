HDQRS. MIDDLE DEPARTMENT, EIGHTH ARMY CORPS,Baltimore, June 17, 1863.

Major-General COUCH,

Harrisburg, Pa.:

The rebel Imboden to-day invested Cumberland with two regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and a battery. He may try to get west on National road to Wheeling. I have General Kelley looking after him. General Tyler reports the enemy gone from Harper's Ferry, but about 8,000 infantry and cavalry at Williamsport, destroying canal, &amp;c., while their cavalry has gone into Pennsylvania. What can you tell me now of the raid in that direction? Has Carlisle been visited? I have my vedettes out, but can hear nothing yet of any coming in this direction.

Major-General BROOKS,

Pittsburg, Pa.:

The rebel Imboden was to-daya at Cumberland with two regiments of infantry, one of cavalry, and a battery. I have directed General Kelley, at New Creek, to look after him, but he may make a push by the National road through Uniontown toward Wheeling. There ought to be a gun-boat at Wheeling, one at Parkersburg, and one in the Big Kanawha. Have you any above Cincinnati?
