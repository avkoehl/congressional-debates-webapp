THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I submit that
objection comes too late. The gentleman from
Indiana yielded me the floor to propound a ques-
tion, and no objection was made at the time.
Mr. COLFAX. I will answer any question
the gentleman may have to put with great pleas •
ure, if the House will give me permission. J have
no more interest in this measure than any other
gentleman who is desirous of connecting the At-
lantic and Pacific States by telegraph.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. This bill provides,
as I understand it, for making an unconditional
grant of land to these parties. That is my con-
struction of its language. If that is its effect, 1
• cannot give the bill my support.
Mr. COLFAX. The gentleman mistakes. The
language is: " to use for ten years."
Mr. REAGAN. Will the gentleman from
Indiana withdraw the previous question for a
moment?
Mr COLFAX. I cannot withdraw the de-
mand for the previous question; but I hope the
House will hear the gentleman.
Mr. LOVEJOY. I object.
Mr. REAGAN. Well,sir; I am entitled to be
heard. This bill does not belong exclusively to
the gentleman from Indiana. I wish to ask the
gentleman if he will permit me to indicate an
amendment to this bill?
Mr. COLFAX. I have no objection whatever.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE, i object.
Mr. REAGAN. I want to say one word to
this House.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I object. I hope
the demand for the previous question will I e vote 1
down, and the bill opened for general delate.
The SPEAKER ordered tellers on seconding
the demand for the previous question, and ap-
pointed Messrs. McPherson and Hamilton.
The House divided; and the tellers reported—
ayes G3, noes 67.
So the demand for the previous question was
not seconded.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I suppose the bill
is now open for general debate?
The SPEAKER. It is.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. I have a very few
remarks which I desire to make in reference to
this bill; and I promise not to detain the House
long.
1 do not fully respond to the objection raised
by the gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Burnett]
in reference to the gentlemen whose names aie
inserted in this bill as incorporators. I have no
great reliance upon the excellence or reliability ( f
the course which is frequently resorted to for the
preservation of the public interest, nameiy, the
letting out of contracts to those who are the low-
est bidders for the Game. I have often known that
those who were the lowest bidders were those,
also, who had consciously made propositions for
an amount lower than the actual cost of doing
the work, for the purpose-of, at a future period,
claiming relief at the hands of Congress, i think
that when gentlemen of known responsibility and
reputation come forward and propose to do a woi k
at a price which other gentlemen of known integ-
rity and intelligence say is as low as the sum for
which it can be performed properly and satisfac-
torily, it is better to let the work to such parties
than to unknown and irresponsible persons, who
may be the lowest bidders.
Therefore, I, for one, do not look upon the fact
that the company to do tins work are named in
the bill at a fixed price, as an insuperable objec-
tion to its passage. But there are features in the
bill which cast a suspicion upon my mind of what
is to be their future effect; and unless that sus-
picion can be removed, I shall be constrained to
give the bill my opposition. In the twentieth
line, on page 2, i find this language:
" And permission is hereby granted to the said pai ties, or
a majority of them, and their assigns, to use, until the end
of the said term, any unoccupied public lands on th j route
of said line or lines vvhichmay be necessaryfor the^ame."
Now, if I understand correctly the force of this
language, the only condition attached to or re-
maining on the lands thus described, continuously
along the route of the telegraphic line from the
Mississippi to the Pacific, is the necessity which
may exist for the use of the same for the purposes
of the company to be incorporated. Who is to
be the judge of this necessity? Is it to be Con-
gress, or the company themselves? or is another
tribunal to be constituted by Congress, that shall
be an ambulatory tribunal to proceed and iudge
upon the necessity, pari passu, along the line from
the Mississippi to the Pacific ?
These are inquiries to which it behooves gen-
tlemen to make satisfactory answers. I hold that
it woula be an unwise provision to refer the ne-
cessity of the occupation of these lands for ten
years, even to any tribunal whatever, whether
nere or elsewhere created.
But, sir, this provision is the more suspicious, in
respect to the main trunk of the line, in that it
differs in pari materia from the provision which is
made in the second section, regarding the blanch
lines which are proposed to be allowed. Respect-
ing these lines, in line ten, section two, page 3 of
the bill, it is provided that the contractors may
select, with the free use during the said term, such
lands as may be necessary for the purpose of es-
tablishing stations for repairs along said line or
lines, not exceeding, at any station, one quaiter
section of land, such stations not to exceed one
in fifteen miles, on an average, of the whole dis-
tance.
This, sir, is entirely different from the provis-
ion to which I have alluded in section one. I
should myself be in favor of section one, if
amended so as to make it conform, in respect of
this provision, with the provision on the same
subject contained in the second section.
Again, in line seventeen of the second section,
is to be found this language:
" Cut should any of said quarter sections be deemed es-
sential by the Government, or any company acting under
its authority, lor railroad purposes, the said coniractois
shall relinquish its occupancy, leceivmgan equal amount
of land in its stead."
Why,sir,the provision here rhade for landsto
be selected, in lieu of lands relinquished for jail-
road purposes, confers them in fee-simple, [do
not believe that such was the intention of the au-
thors of the bill; but such unquestionably is the
effect of its language. But, in order to prevent
such injurious results, or the possibility of such
a contingency, I would propose an amendment
adequate to the purpose.
Mr. BURCH. If the gentleman from New
York will allow me, I would ask him if the use
of the word "instead," in the conclusion of the
section, does notlimi tand confine the tenure of the
lands selected, the same as is done in the original
grant? The original grant being simply foi its use
for ten years, the lands selected"instead ''cannot
be granted "in fee " by the use of the word "in-
stead."
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. The words used
here may admit of a construction which presumes
a conveyance in fee, and they may not. The
danger is, that they would raise a question for
our judicial tribunals, and it would be wrong to
permit the possibility of such a question, if we
can prevent it at this time. The insertion of these
words would prevent that contingency. We may
prevent itby inserting, in line seventeen, the words
"for such occupancy " between the words "land"
and " in its stead;'5 so that it would reod: " re-
ceiving an equal amount of land for such occu-
pancy in its stead." These are the objections to
the bill which have occurred to me.
Mr. COLFAX. If the gentleman is sincerely
in favor of this bill, and as he is a better lawyer
than I am, I will tell him that I am willing to
adopt any language that lie may deem proper to
carry out his conclusions. I have inserted words
in the bill, at line twenty-one, which, I think, will
meet the gentleman's objections. The fnst sec-
tion reads, with the words inserted, as follows:
" And permission is licrebygrantod to the said p-irtie*,or
a majority oi tlii'in. and tiic.tr assignees, tQ uso foi right of
vva>, .-ubjeu to the approval of the President," &c.
I do not see howit would grant a fee-simple of
the land, if the right to use it be granted it for ten
years.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. The gentleman
misunderstands me. I do not believe that the grant
in the first section will convey a title in fee-simple.
It confines the grant of the land undoubtedly to
the purpose ofSiser; but I contend that the land
to be used is, by the language of the bill, unlim-
ited in quantity. If the gentleman will apply to
the first section the same language of limitation
that he applies to the second, the section will then,
in my opinion, be unobjectionable. I suggest that
the words "unless said lands shall be required
by the Government of the United States for a
railroad or other purposes" be stricken out, a d
these words inserted in lieu of them :
For the purpose of establishing stations for repairs along
said line or lines, not exceeding at any station one quarter
section of land; such stations not to exceed one to every
fifteen miles, on an average, along the whole distance*
i section, in that case, will be unobjectiona-
ble to me.
Mr. COLFAX. I am perfectly willing to ac-
cept the amendment. I understand that the gen-
tleman's objection applies to the text of the Sen-
ate which we left untouched.
Mr. JOHN COCHRANE. Does the gentle-
man accept my amendment, inserting the words,
"for such occupancy."
Mr. COLFAX. I will accept that amendment.
I had made on amendment, however, which I
thought would better cover the ground: to insert
the words, "the use of;" so that the section
would read:
But should any of said (juartersections be deemed essen-
tial by the Government, or any company acting under its
authonty, for railroad purposes, the said contractors shall
relinquish its occupancy, receiving the use of an equal
amount ofland in its stead.
But I will accept the amendment exactly as
suggested by the gentleman from New York,
[Mr. John Cochrane.]
Mr. PHELPS. I rise for the purpose of sub-
mitting- an amendment.' It is proposed, in the
substitute submitted, to fix upon the city of St.
Joseph. I want to amend so that the city of St.
Louis will be fixed as the starting point, instead
of St. Joseph. St. Louis is the centra] point to
which messages are to be sent from all the east-
ern citics. It is the headquarters for the western
military department of the United States. It is a
point from which all of your military operations
are to commence. The commandant of the west-
ern military department is stationed there, and
not at St. Joseph.
Mr.CRAIG, of Missouri. My colleague knows
that a telegraphic line is built from St. Louis four
hundred miles and more, to the city of St. Joseph,
onthebordcrandfrontmgtheTerritory ofKansas.
I understand that these incorporators will not agree
to build a line four hundred miles longer than the
one proposed in the bill, and still be compelled to
send telegraphic messages for three dollars each.
It would be unfair and unjust to the incorporators
to compel them to build four hundred additional
miles of telegraph through Missouri and Kansas,
to get to the starting point proposed m this bill.
St. Joseph is in telegraphic communication with
every city, town, and hamlet upon the Atlantic
slope. It is the starting point for the pony ex-
press to California. It is upon the same parallel
of latitude with the Pike's Peak gold diggings,
Salt Lake Valley, and the Washoe silver mines.
If my colleague is dissatisfied with St. Joseph as
the starting point, let him propose an amendment,
that the line shall start somewhere upon the west-
ern border of the State of Missouri. I will vote
against the amendment; but it will afford a means
to test the question.
Mr. PHELPS. The explanation given by my
colleague amounts to this: these incorporators
have constructed a line of telegraph four hundred
miles long, and they want to tax everybody, who
lives east of St. Joseph, an additional sum for
sending messages to the Pacific ocean. I can favor
no such scheme. The argument in favor of start-
ing the line from St. Joseph is this, and nothing
more. A line of telegraph, as I have already
stated, has been constructed by the incorporators
named in this bill from St. Louis to St. Joseph,
and if St. Joseph be allowed to remain as the
starting point, then they will, in addition to the
sum fixed in the bill, be enabled to charge those
extra for sending messages to the Pacific, or re-
ceiving messages' from the Pacific, who live east
of St. Joseph.
Mr. CLARK, of New York. Charge what-
ever they please.
Mr. PHELPS. Yes, sir. If these men are not
willing to have the starting place fixed upon tho
bank of the Mississippi river, then I will say to
the House that there are those who will contract
under the provisions of this bill fixing that start-
ing point.
Mr. CRAIG, of Missouri. The charge in this
bill for sending a telegraphic message of over two
thousand miles of wire is three dollars. Where,
upon the American continent, or throughout the
