NASHVILLE, TENN., December 6, 1864 - 8 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Your telegram of 1 p. m. this day is just received. I know that a great many horses have been issued to the cavalry of the Military Division of the Mississippi since September. a great many have been lost in battle, and a great many have died of glanders and distemper, and a large number of the men are still dismounted. I have seen General Wilson to-night, who encourages me to hope that he will be able to mount 6,000 or 7,000 in three days from this time. The enemy have made no new developments to-day. I will attack him as soon as General Wilson can get together a sufficient cavalry force to protect my flanks.
