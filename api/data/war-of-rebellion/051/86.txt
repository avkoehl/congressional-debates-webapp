JOHN K. JACKSON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Numbers 242.

Report of Lieutenant Thomas G. Barrett, Ordnance Officer.

COLONEL: In compliance with orders dated Richmond, June 24, 1863, Office War Department, requiring corps, division, and brigade ordnance officers to make reports of their actions and of their detail during each battle, I have the honor to submit the following report of the battle of Chickamauga on September 19 and 20:

As we were in General Cheatham's division, I reported to Major Cheatham, his ordnance officer, with my ordnance train, and remained under his orders during the fight of the 19th, always in thrower of the brigade and supplying the troops with ammunition whenever needed.

At 5 p. m. of the 20th, I was ordered to report to General Cleburne's division ordnance officer, as our brigade had been transferred to his division. I reported with my train to him immediately, and supplied the brigade that night with ammunition as they came out of the fight after dark.

Next morning we were again transferred to General Cheatham's division, to whose ordnance officer I reported, and have been with ever since.

I have the honor to report my detail did their duty very well, always keeping up communication with the brigade and collecting ordnance stores from the field, which I left for want of transportation.

The report of Captain Scogin's battery, attached to our brigade, has been forwarded to chief of artillery of division.

I have the honor to report ammunition expended by small-arms:

Numbers of rounds 53,660

Number of men engaged 1,200

Ammunition issued all in good order.

I am, colonel, your obedient servant,

T. G. BARRETT,

Ordnance Officer, Jackson's Brigade.

[Colonel H. OLADOWSKI,

Chief of Ordnance, Army of Tennessee.]
