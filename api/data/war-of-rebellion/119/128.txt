Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: I have learned from a reliable source that Major C. B. Owsley has been tried at Bowling Green, Ky., as a spy or for recruiting in Kentucky. Major Owsley was acting under orders from Major-General Wheeler. Will you please inform meas to the fact and what has been the result?

I am credibly informed that there are quite a number of our soldiers captured early in last year who are now held at ship Island. Your notification to General Banks seems to have worked no results. Of the First Louisiana Regiment there are Privates McLane, Kane, Doyle, Smith, Stanley, and others captured in May, 1862, and now at Ship Island. Also Captain William McLane; Captain F. Taylor, Lieutenant Ulysses M. Wattigny, of the Thirtieth Louisiana Regiment; William Gant and John How, of the Stuart Cavalry; and citizens J. G. Browne and Marshall. These officers and soldiers have all been declared exchanged, and yet in violation of our agreements are still held in confinement.

In one of my former communications I asked you why you held on to Lieutenant Baker, who was captured with Colonel Morehead. Lieutenant Baker was and probably is at Fortress Monroe. You have not responded. I wished to know what was the ground of distinction between Colonel Morehead and Lieutenant Baker. Lieutenant Baker is exchanged by our agreements. Will you please answer?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

Richmond, July 18, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel WILLIAM H. LUDLOW, Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Can you inform me where Lee A. Dunn, a member of the Kind William Home Gurad, who was captured in the vicinity of Nelson's Bridge a short time ago, is? The officer in command of the Federal forces threatened to hang every man of the Home Guard who was captured. It is represented to me that Captain Compton is confined in a dark cell, 4 by 10 feet, and manacled, and that his health is becoming so much affected by his confinement that a few weeks more will suffice to cause his death. Will you inform me whether this is so, and also what it is proposed to do with him?

I also learn that Major Armies (or Ormesby) and Lieutenant Davis are to be tried on the charge of recruiting within your lines. I understand they are confined in a cell. I am also informed that Captain William F. Gordon is in close confinement and that he either has been or is to be tried upon some charge.

I also learn that Captain Camp has been put in solitary confinement.

I will thank you to inform me what are the charges respectively against these officers and what has been done with them, and especially whether the representations herein made are true. They are all confined at Fort McHenry.

I will also be obliged to you if you will inform me whether it is the intention of your Government to continue to try our officers on the charge of recruiting within your lines, and on conviction visit them with the death penalty.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
