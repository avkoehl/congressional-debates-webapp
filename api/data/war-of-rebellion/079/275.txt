WASHINGTON, October 14, 1864-1. 30 p. m.

Major General G. H. THOMAS,

Nashville, Tenn.:

General Grant suggests the abandonment of the railroad from Columbia to Decatur and thence to Stevenson, in order to give you more force against Hood.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, October 14, 1864-5. 30 p. m.

(Received 15th.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I have already ordered all the troops that have been operating against Forrest to Chattanooga, except Croxton's brigade of cavalry, which has been left to guard the river from Decatur to Eastport. The enemy's (Forrest's) pickets are on the south bank of the river, and if Croxton and Granger were withdrawn I am satisfied he would push across the river and operate against our direct line of communication, with no adequate force to successfully oppose him.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General.

(Same to Major-General Halleck.)

MURFREESBOROUGH, October 14, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

We arrived here this evening on special train, having made a careful inspection to this point. All block-houses between here and Nashville are double-cased and in excellent condition. The one at Stewart's Creek is half done and well done. The One hundred and fifteenth Ohio deserve great credit for their work. We leave in the morning.

Respectfully,

WM. E. MERRILL,

Colonel and Chief Engineer.

NASHVILLE, October 14, 1864.

The major-general commanding desires you to report at once in round numbers the number of rations of each kind you have in store in Chattanooga, and the number of days they will last.
