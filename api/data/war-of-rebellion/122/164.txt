BOSTON, MASS., May 6, 1861.

Hon. SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

What officers will muster in men under the proclamation? How many regiments will you take? I want to give six now.

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts.

EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT, Trenton, May 6, 1861.

To His Excellency ABRAHAM LINCOLN:

SIR: I have duly received your favor of the 4th instant, stating that you would recommend to the War Department that the services of General Wright and the Second Division of New Jersey State Militia be received into the new corps of volunteers for which your proclamation is issued. Permit me to say that I have to-day a dispatch from the Secretary of War that our State will probably not be entitled to more than two regiments of this new corps. That being the case, it would be best to have the quota of New Jersey generally distributed throughout the State, rather than to take the entire Second Division, which would probably exhaust the whole number New Jersey is entitled to. When the Secretary is ready for the new corps he probably will inform me, and I will make such distribution of the privilege of volunteering as will give general satisfaction in all the counties of our State. Many companies are waiting, whom it would not do to disappoint by sending an entire division.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHS. S. OLDEN.

I am, very respectfully,

SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War.
