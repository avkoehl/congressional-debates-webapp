do to fail in that. I should like you to watch the enemy as long as you possible can without endangering your small command. Send cars, &amp;c., and, keeping a locomotive, watch the rebel movements, and keep me informed. Brown must soon be in the rear of the enemy.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 9, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

It is too late to do anything beyond Tipton now. If Crittenden, is correct in his report with regard to the rebels' advance on Tipton, I cannot do anything for Boonville either, and, unless Guitar reaches that place, I fear for the result if the rebels should attack it. The only hope is that Brown will move rapidly and overtake the rebels. He certainly must be following them.

I have not over 600 effective men to defend Jefferson. It evidently will not do to reduce this force under existing circumstances. I hope to-morrow will bring the 500 additional men you promised me. Would it not be well to send me [J. M.] Cockefair? I have but one section of artillery here, as you are aware, and that, I presume is not extra. I expect some considerable force of militia to report to-morrow, who have been called out by General Crawford. I shall hasten this matter up.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 9, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have not force enough to send to La Mine, now that the enemy is on the railroad. My whole force here as yet would not be strong enough to meet the rebels along the road, and would more than likely be cut off in their effort to join Hall. Can Ewing not send some troops to Hall's assistance? You can reach Hall now better than I can. Please instruct him in any matter of importance to the interests of his command. Please direct Hall to keep Brown well informed of the movements of the enemy by frequent expresses.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., October 9, 1863

Brigadier-General BROWN, in the Field:

By going to Osceola you have missed the enemy entirely. You should move northeasterly and strike him as soon as possible. Colonel Edwards must be near you; if you can bring him within co-operating distance, do so.
