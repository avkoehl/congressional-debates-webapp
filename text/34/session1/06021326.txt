hebrew congregation in washington.
Mr. CUMBACK. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the House to report from the Committee
for the District of Columbia, and put upon its
passage, Senate bill No. 199. It is for the benefit
of a religious society in this city, and will produce
no discussion whatever. I hope there will be no
objection.
There being no objection, Mr. C. reported back
a bill for the benefit of the Hebrew congregation
in the city of Washington.
The bill provides that all the rights, privileges,
and immunities, heretofore granted bylaw to the
Christian churches in the city of Washington,
be extended to the Hebrew congregation of said
city, and that the 3d section of the act approved
the 17th of June, 1844, entitled "An act concern-
ing conveyances or devises of places of public
worship in the District of Columbia," shall be
so construed as to allow the members of the He-
brew congregation, from time to time, by a vote
of two thirds, to elect their own trustees, and the
same, by a like vote, to displace at pleasure;
which said trustees shall, during their continuance
in office, have the same title in, and power over,
any lot or tract of land as if held by them under
the act aforesaid for a Christian church, or as if
they were appointed under said act trustees of
any Christian church: Provided, That any and
all legal and equitable rights, demands, or liabil-
ities of the said Hebrew congregation, acquired
or assumed by or through said trustees, shall be
limited to the trust property of said congregation
held by said trustees.
The bill was ordered to be read a third time;
and it was accordingly read a third time, and
passed.
john nugent.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. There was a bill
of the Senate referred to the Committee on Naval
Affairs here, for the relief of John Nugent, giving
him a pension for the loss of both his arms, some
time last year, on one of the United States ships
in the firing of a salute. He is now in the city,
I think; I met him a few days ago. I suppose
that the House will some time pass that bill. I
know nothing of it, or of the case, except what
he told me, and what the bill itself relates. At
the time I met him, there was in his company
another person, who had formerly been a sailor,
and who was in the same condition; and he in-
formed me that a law similar to this one had been
passed for his relief at some prior session of Con-
gress. I think, therefore, that under the circum-
stances it would be as well for the House to take
up and vote upon this bill and pass it at once.
It is certainly a very urgent case.
There being no objection, Senate bill (No. 328)
for the relief of John Nugent was taken up.
The bill grants to John Nugent, of the city of
New York, who, while engaged in his duty on
board the United States sloop Germantown, m
November, 1855, at Montevideo, and while in the
act of firing a salute in honor of the birthday of
the Q,ucen of Spain, had one arm blown off, and
the other so much injured that it had to be sub-
sequently amputated, a pension of §30 per month,
to commence on 1st January, 1856, and to con-
tinue during his natural life, to bo paid out of the
Navy pension fund.
Mr. JONES. This bill proposes to give to
John Nugent, for the loss of both his arms, a
pension of thirty dollars per month, in lieu of the
pension to which he would be entitled by law. I
think that, for the loss of both arms, that is not
too high a pension.
Mr. BENSON. I would simply state, that a
majority of the Committee on Naval Affairs has
examined the case. The man is now in the city.
I believe that, if the bill had gone before the com-
mittee and been examined, it would have received
the unanimous approbation of the committee. I
hope it will be passed.
The bill was read the third time, and passed.
