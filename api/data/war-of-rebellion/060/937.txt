CLARKSBURG, April 21, 1864.

(Received 10.30 p. m.)

Major-General STAHEL,

Chief of Cavalry:

Have been unable to procure sufficient transportation, owing to the use of the cars by General Sullivan's command. Cannot say how long I shall be delayed. Have used every endeavor since I received the order, but some of the cars promised to me have been taken by other commands. The Fourteenth Pennsylvania is gone, but 420 of the First Virginia and the wagons are yet to go.

WM. W. AVERELL.

Major-General STAHEL,

Chief of Cavalry:

Ewing's battery is mentioned in the general's telegram, but does not say where it is to be ordered. Please answer at Clarksburg.

WM. W. AVERELL,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND, April 21, 1864.

Brigadier General W. W. AVERELL:

All the transports required for the infantry; besides, your cavalry have to escort the train. Should, however, the train not be in readiness by the time your troops are ready to march, you will march on, but leave an escort of 100 men to go with the troops.

JUL. STAHEL,

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, April 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General AVERELL:

General Crook is informed that you will take command of all his cavalry, including your two regiments, the First Virginia and Fourteenth Pennsylvania, in all eight regiments, and organize them into a division. This organization will be permanent. All other cavalry left in the centra and eastern part of the State will be organized into another division. General Stahel misunderstood me in saying that the former organization will continue.

F. SIGEL,

Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, April 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General AVERELL:

General Crook telegraphs that he does not want Ewing's battery; you will order it to return to Martinsburg, as directed in General Stahel's telegram of yesterday.

By order of Major-General Stahel:

THOS. H. WILLSTED,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
