Captain J. H. STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Warrensburg, Mo.:

Have just returned. Scouted thoroughly in neighborhood of Round and Texas Prairies, Bone Hill, Snibar Hills, and Blue Bottoms. The enemy have not left the country. Small bands of from five to twenty are passing and repassing the line of La Fayette and Jackson Counties every day. Found water very scarce. Both men and horses suffered from thirst. Spy reports that a party of soldiers found the hiding place of Dick Yeager, where he was lying wounded, and killed him, supposed to be some of the Missouri State Militia. They did not know that it was Dick they killed. So says the report.
