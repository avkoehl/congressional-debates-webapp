STAFFORD COURT-HOUSE,

June 14, 1863-12 m.

General HANCOCK:

GENERAL: At this hour the trains of the Sixth Corps are yet passing, with, perhaps, 5 miles of their trains yet to pass. The Second Corps trains are waiting here, before taking the road to Dumfries, for the Sixth Corps trains to pass. It is doubtful whether all the Sixth Corps trains will make Dumfries before night. General Sedgwick has been directed to post a brigade to cover the roads from Berea Church and Hartwood Church to this point, to remain until you come up. The general direct that you do not withdraw from the river until everything has passed this point. Officers must push on the trains. Telegraphic communication is directed to be kept up from Potomac Creek Station and Stafford Court-House until you pass. General Sedgwick will probably be at Stafford Court- House to-night for his headquarters. The general is now leaving for Dumfries. General Sedgwick will keep two divisions in Potomac Bottom, to assist you, if necessary, until you withdraw.
