You are directed to move forward to a distance that will leave in your rear some forage that can be got by trains from here. He directs that such forage be not used by your command, but preserved to be collected by the trains. He also desires you to move in such manner as will prevent from destruction any forage that is in the line of your advance. Please report as you advance as frequently as convent of your progress.

It is proper to state that as a considerable portion of the detachment under General Lawler's command is not yet returned it may be impossible to put him and the command I design to assign to him in motion so early as daylight in the morning.

I am, very respectfully,

JOHN A. McCLERNAND,

Major-General, Commanding.

The exigency prompting the dispatch is briefly but forcibly expressed in the postscript to the same by General Dwight. You will take with you General Cameron's division, and Colonel Landram with his division will follows so soon as you have taken position, and
