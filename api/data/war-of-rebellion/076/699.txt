HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

In the Field, Red Oak, Ga., August 29, 1864-8 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland:

GENERAL: I have seen General Howard. You will move to-morrow for Shoal Creek Church and on to the road leading from Decatur to Fayetteville, half way between Morrow's Mill and the Renfroe Place (Couch's). Move the head of your column by Mrs. Long's place, taking care to leave room for General Schofield to pass the same point up toward Morrow's Mill. Please report to me if Generals Davis or Stanley moved toward East Point far enough to secure the road by which I design General Schofield to move, viz, from D. Mims' up along the railroad to the road represented as leading down to Mrs. Long's. General Howard starts at 7 a. m. I would like you to reach Shoal Creek Church as early as 10 a. m. at further, to cover General Howard's movement, who will, if possible, reach Jonesborough to-morrow.

Yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Red Oak, August 29, 1864.

Major General W. T. SHERMAN,

Commanding Military Division of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Your note of this evening received. I presume that Davis moved sufficiently far toward East Point to secure the road you speak of. General Carlin reports having destroyed the road two miles above his camp, which must have taken him above that point. the head of my column will be at Shoal Creek Church by 8 a. m., unless strongly resisted. My columns will move by Mrs. Long's place and cover the Decatur and Fayetteville road.

Yours, respectfully,

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.
