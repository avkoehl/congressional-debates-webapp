Interference in Elections—Mr. Buchanan.
Senate.
pol ticil journals, whose business and whose duty
it is to eii'ighten public opinion in regard to the
met us or demerits of cand dates for office'' Pass
this law, and you declare that no editor of a pub-
lic panel, of either paity, is capable orwoithy
rf hold ng any of the pioscribed offices He
nirl at onco cither abandon h s piper, and with
it the mi ani of suppoiting himself and his fam-
ily, or he must sunetidci any little office which
In may hold undei the Government
And yet this bill is supported by mvfnend
fiom Vngima. who, to use his own linguage,
" has been imbued with the piinciplcs of democ-
racy, and a iegard foi State lights, fiom his ear-
liest youth " If such aohaige should ever be
made against htm hereaftei, his sptech and h s
vote in favor of this bill will acquit him before
any court in Christendom where the truth maybe
given in evidence I yet trust that he may never
vote fot its passage
Every measure of this kind betrays a want of
confidence in the intelligence and patnotismof the
American people It is founded on a distrust of
then judgment and integrity Do you suppose
that when a man is appointed a collectoi oi a
postmaster he acquires any more influence ovei
the people than he had befoie ' No, sn ' On the
contiary, his influence is often diminished instead
of being ineieased The people of this country
are abundantly capable of judging whether he is
most influenced by love of countiy or love of of-
fice If they should determine that his motives
are puiely merccnaiy for supporting apolitical
party, this will destroy his influence If he be a
noisy, violent, and meddling politician, he will
do the Administration under which ho has been
appointed much more haim than good Let me
assuie gentlemen that the people aie able to take
caie of themst Ives They do not requite the in-
terposition of Congress to pre v en t them fiom being
deceived and led astray by the influence of office-
holders Whilst this is my fitted opinion, I think
the number of Fedi ral officeis ought to be strictly
limited to the actual necessities of the Govern
ment Puisue this couise, and, my life for it,
all the land officers and postmastets and weighers
and gaugers which you shall send abroad ovei
the country can never influence the people to be-
tray their own cause For my own part, I en-
teitain the most pel feet confidence in their intelli-
gence as well as integnty
'I hat office holdeis possess compaiatively but
little influence over the people, will conclusively
appeal from the brief history of the last two yctrs,
the peuod duting which this dieaded man, Mi
Van Buien, has been in office What has all this
alarming influence of the office holders effected at
the only points where they aie to be found in any
consideiable numbei' In the city of Philadelphia,
notwithstanding all the influence of the custom-
house, the post office,and the mint, the majonty,
at the last election, against the Admimstiation
was tiemendous, being, I believe, upwards of four
tho isand The Pretonan guaids, as they have
been oiled, performed but little seivice on that
dav in that city On the other hand, look at the
inteiior of Pennsylvania There the Governor,
whose patronage withm the limits of the State
was as great, under the old constitution, as that
of the King of England, had iibed every office
with enemies of the present Administration Of
this I do not complain, for, whether right or
wrong, it lias been the long-established practice
of both political parties It is true that many of
the postmasters were fiiendly to the Admimstia-
tion, but it is equally ceitain that a large propor-
tion of them warmly espoused the cause of the
Opposition What was the result' Thosewield-
mg this vast pationage were entuely routed, not-
withstanding the exeitions of the office holders
Gentlemen may quiet their alarms, and be assured
that the people cannot be persuaded to abandon
their principles by the influence of men in office
Again let us look at the State of New Yoik
for another example There the Albany Regency
weie seated in power The Democratic party
was well drilled All the offico-holdeis of the
State and of the city were fiiendly to the Admin-
istration Besides, in my opinion, they fought in
the Hghteous cause, and this same abused Albany
Regency, who were their leadeis, was composed
of as able and as honest men as were ever at the
head of anv State government What was the
result there' With all this official power and
pationage, both of the State and Federal Govern-
ments, we were beaten, horse, foot, and dra-
goons Theie is not the least necessity foi pass
ing an unconstitutional law to save the people
from the influence ot the offiee-hold-=is
Have we not been beaten in all the large cities
of th< Union, where only there are Federal offi
cers in any considerable number' What has
been our fate in New York, Philadelphia, Bos
ton, Baltimoie, and New Oilcans' We have
been vanquished in all of them The hobgob-
lins and chimeras dire respecting the influence of
office-holders which terrify gentlemen, exist only
in their own imagination The people of tins
countiy arc not the tame and servile creatures
who can be seduced fiom their purpose by the
persuasion of the office-holders It is tiue that
in 1828 I did say that the office-holders were the
enlisted soldieis of that Administration by which
they weie sustained This was too strong an
expression But admit them to be enlisted sol-
diers, and whilst I do not deny them some influ-
ence, theie is no danger to be apprehended from
it as long as there is virtue and intelligence among
oui people
And heio I hope the Senator from Kentucky
will pardon me for suggesting to him an amend-
ment to his bill He has, I think, made one or
two mistakes in the classification of his officers,
though, m the general, it is sufficiently perfect
The principle would seem to have been to sepa-
late what may be called the aristocracy of office-
holdeis fiom the plebeians Those of the elevated
class are still permitted to en]oy the freedom of
speech and of the piess, whilst the haid working
opeialtves among them are denied this puvilcge
The heads of Departments and buieaus, the offi
cers of the Army and Navy, the superintendents
and officers of our mints, and our district attor-
neys, are not affected by the bill These gentle-
men aie privileged by their elevation They are
too high to be reached by Us provisions Who,
then, ought to care whether weighers and gaugers,
and village postmasters, and hard handed dray
men, and such inferior people, shall be permitted
to express their thoughts on public affairs ' I
would suggest, however, that the collectoi s of
our pnncipal sea poits, the marshals of our ex
tensive judicial districts, and the postmasters in
our piinripal cities, receive compensation suffi
cient to enable them to figure in "good society,"
They ought to rank with the district attorneys,
and should be elevated fiom the plebeian to the
patrician rank of office holders They ought to
be allowed the freedom of speech and of the
piess As to the suboidinate officeis, they are
not worth the tiouble of a thought
To be sure, there is one palpable absurdity on
the face of the bill Its avowed purpose is to pie-
vent office holdeis from exercising an influence in
elections Why, then, except fiom its operation
all those office holders who, fiom their station in
society, can exercise the most extensive influ-
ence, and confine its proMsions to the humbler,
but not less meritorious class whose opinions can
have but a limited influence over their fellow men'
The district attoiney, for example, is excepted—
the very man of all otheis who, fiom his position
and talents, has the best opportunity of exerting
an extensive influence He may ride over his
district, and make political speeches to secure the
election of his favoiite candidate He is too high
a mark for the gentleman's bill But if the sub-
ordinates of the custom house or the petty post-
master at the cross loads, with an income of fifty
dollars per annum, shall dare, even in private
conversation, to persuade an elector to vote for
or against any candidate, he is to be punished by
a fine of $500, and a perpetual disability to hold
any office undei the Government Was there
e^er a bill more unequal or mole unjust'
Now, sn, I might heie, with great propriety,
and very much to the relief both of my audience
and myself, leave this subject, but there are still
some other observations which I conceive it to be
my dutyto add to what I have already said Most
of them will be elicited by the very strong remarks
of my friend fiom Virginia, for I trust that I may
still be permitted to call him by that name
He and I entered the House of Repreeentatives
almost together. I believe he came into it but
two years after myself We soon formed a mutual
friendship, which has ever since, I may say, on
my part, with gieat sincerity, continued to exist.
We fought shoulder to shoulder, and his great
poweis were united with my feeble efforts in pros-
trating the administration of the younger Adams
General Jackson came into power, and, during
the whole peuod of that administration, he was
the steady, unwaveung supporter of all its lead-
ing measuies, except the specie circular and his
advocacy of the currency bill, and, on that bill, I
stood by him, m opposition to the Administration.
Whilst tins man of destiny was m power—this
man of the lion heart, whose will the Whigs de-
clared was law, and whose roaring terrified all
the other beasts of the forest, and subdued them
into silence—where was then the Senator from
Virginia' He was our chosen champion in the
fight Whilst General Jackson was exerting all
this tremendous influence, and marshaling alihis
trained bands of office-holders to do his bidding,
according to the language of the Opposition, these
denunciations had no terrors for the Senator from
Virginia Never in my life did I perform a duty
of friendship with gieater ardor than when, on
one occasion, I came to his rescue from an unjust
attack made against him by the Whigs, in rela-
tion to a part of his conduct whilst Minister to
Prance After holding out so long together, ought
he not, at least, to have parted from us in peace,
and bade us a kind adieu ' In abandoning our
camp, why did he shoot Parthian arrows behind
him' In taking leave of us, I hope not forever,
is it not too hard for us to hear ourselves de-
nounced by the gentleman in the language which
he has used
" lie is amazed and bewildered with the scenes passing
before him Whither, he iska, will the mid dominion oí
party carry us' His mind is filled with despondencv as to
the lite ot his country Shill we emulate the servility ot
ihe Senate and people of Rome7 You already have youi
Pietonan bands, in tins city "
I might quote from his speech other phrases
of a similar character, but these are sufficient. 1
do not believe that any of these expressions were
aimed at me personally, yet they strike me with
the mass of my political friends, and I feel bound
to give them a passing notice.
And why, let me ask the Senator, why did he
not sooner make the discovery of the appalling
danger of Executive influence' Is there more to
be dreaded from that cause under the present
Administiation than under that which is past'
Is Martin Van Buren more foi midable than Gen-
eral Jackson was' Let his favorite author, de
Tocqucville, answer this question.    He says
"The power of Genera! Jackson perpetually increases,
but that of the President declines , m his hands the Federal
Government is strong, but it will j>ass enfeebled into the
hands oj Ins successor "
Do we not all now know this to be the truth'
Has not the Government passed enfeebled into
the hands of his successor' We see it and feel
it and know it from everything which is passing
around us The civilian has succeeded the con-
queror, and, I must be permitted to say, has ex-
ercised his high poweis with great moderation
and purity of purpose In what manner has he
ever abused his patronage' In this particular, of
what can the gentleman complain '
In February, 1828,1 did say that the office-
holders weie the enlisted soldiers of the Admin-
istration. But did I then propose to gag them >
Did I propose to deprive them of the freedom of
speech and of the press ' No, sir, no ' Not-
withstanding the number of them scattered over
the country, I was not afraid of their influence.
On the contrary, I commended the Administra-
tion for adhering to its friends. I then used the
following language:
" In my humble judgment, the present Administration
could not have proceeded a single year, with the least hope
of reelection but for their patronage This patronage may
have heen used unwise!}, as my friend from Kentucky f Mr.
Letcher] (and I im still proud to call him my friend not
withstanding our political opposition) has insinuated Í
have nevei blamed them, I shall never blame them for ad
henntr to their friends Be true to your friends and they
uil! be true to jou is the dictate both of jiisiioe and ot
sound pohev I «hall never participate m abusing the Ad
ministration for remembering their Inends If >ou go too
much abroad with tins patronage for the purpose oi making
new friends, you will offend your old ones, aud make but
very insincere converts ' >
