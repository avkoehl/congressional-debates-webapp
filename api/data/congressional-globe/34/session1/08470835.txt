Remarks on the « hole—Supposing the average period of
enlistment for aitthe years to be about the same, North and
South, it will be seen that in the first years of the Revolu-
tion, when the war was chiefly at the North, the southern
States supplied each year about one-third of the whole
number of enlistments. As soon, however, as the war
extended southward, and became general, the southern
States rapidly advanced, supplying one half; and for 1780,
1781, and 1782, more than one half of all the enlistments.
Mr. Seybert refers to a paper presented to Congress in 1811,
which shows the regular troops raised in the devolution,
number serviceable in eamp, and expenses of the army.

The following table was made up for the New York Sun
6om official data. In the preceding article is a table of the
soldiers furnished by the different States in the Revolution.
A writer ia the Philadelphia North American conceives
that we give too great a preponderance to the North, whose
soldiers enlisted often, and for very snort periods. This
does most materially affect Ihe case, and we are obliged to
the writer for the correction.

At the beginning of the Revolution the southern colonies
had, therefore, 812,000 white inhabitants, and the northern
1,491,000. Connecticut wasjhe fourth State in rank. Mas-
sachusetts and Pennsylvania were each a third larger than
New York, which was even excelled by Connecticut.
South Carolina may challenge comparison with
Massachusetts on the muster-roll; on the pension
list she yields to her supremacy. The citizens of
the latter, whatever their achievements may have
been on the battle-field, have always fallen with
alacrity into hollow squares before the Treas-
ury, and have beeq more formidable to it than an
" army with banners."
Now, sir, let us see something of the gallantry
of Massachusetts in the war of the Revolution,
which has been so noisily vaunted here. The
following correspondence occurred while the
British were in possession of Boston, and the
American forces under General Washington were
beleaguering it. General Washington, in a letter
to his brother, John Augustine Washington,
dated "Camp at Cambridge, July 27, 1775,"
says:
" I found a mixed multitude of people here, under very
little discipline, order, or government." '
In a letter'to the President of the Council of
Massachusetts buy, dated August 7, 1775—a
month after he arrived there—General Washing-
ton says:
" By the general return made to mc for last week, 1 find
there arc great numbers of soldiers and non-comnussioni <1
officers who absent themselves fVom duty, the greater part
2,981 of whom, 1 have reason to believe, arc at their respective
homes, in different parts of thecountry; some employed by
their officers on their farms, and others drawing pay from
the public, while they are working on their own plantations
or for hire. My utmost exertions have not been able to pre-
vent this base and pernicious conduct."
In a letter to the President of Congress, dated
September 21, 1775, he says:
" The necessities of the troops having required pay, I
directed that those of Massachusetts should receive for one
month., upon their being mustered and returning a proper
roll; but a claim was immediately made lor pay by lunar
months, and several regiments have declined taking up ilicir
warrants on this account."
In a letter to the President of Congress, dated
November 11, 1775, General Washington says:
" The trouble 1 have in the arrangement of the army is
really inconceivable. Many of the officers sent in their
names to serve in expectation of promotion; otliers stood
aloof, to see what advantage they could make tor them-
selves; whilst a number, who had declined, have again
sent in their names to serve. So great has been the con-
fusion, arising from these and many other perplexing cir-
cumstances, that I found it absolutely impossible to fix this
very interesting business exactly on the plan resolved on
in the conference, though 1 have kept up to the spirit of it
as near as the nature and necessity of the case would ad-
mit. The difficulty with the soldiers is as great, indeed,
more so, if possible, than with the officers. They will not
enlist until th«^ know their colonel, lieutenant colonel,
major, and captain, so that it was necessary to fix the offi-
cers the first thing, which is, at last, in some manner, done;
and 1 have given out enlisting orders."
In a letter to the President of Congress, dated
November 28, 1775—when the yeac for which
the men had enlisted was near its close—he
says:
"The number enlisted since my last is two thousand five
hundred and forty men ; and I am sorry to be necessitated
to mention to you tile egregious want of public spirit which
reigns here. Instead of pressing to be engaged in the cause
of their country, which I vainly flattered myself would be
the case, I find we are likely to be deserted in a most critical
time. Those that have enlisted must have a furlough,
which I have been obliged to grant tu fifty at a time, from
each regiment."
In a letter to Joseph Reed, of date November
28,1775, he says: , .
" Such a dearth of public.spirit, ami sech a want of vir-
tue, such stock-jobbing,.mid, fertility is aH- the low arts to
obtain advantages of one kind or another, in this great
change of military arrangement, I never saw before, and I
pray God's mercy that I may never be witness to again.
What will be the end of these maneuvers is beyond my
scan. I tremble at the prospect. We have been till this
time enlisting about three thousand five hundred men. To
engage those I have been obliged to allow furloughs as far
as fifty men to a regimept; and the officers, I am per-
suaded, indulge as manymore. Such .a mercenary spirit
pervades the whole, that I should not at all be surprised at
any disaster that may happen. In short, after the last of
this month, our lines will be so weakened, that the minute-
men and militia must be called in for their defense; and
these, being under no kind of government themselves, will
destroy the little subordination 1 have been laboring to
establish, and run me into one evil whilst I am endeavor-
ing to avoid another; but the less must be chosen. Could
I have foreseen what I have experienced, and am likely to
experience, no consideration upon earth should have in-
duced me to accept this command. A regiment, or any
subordinate department, would have been accompanied by
ten times the satisfaction, and perhaps the honor."
This was whilst the enemy had possession of
their capital, and a large number encamped in
full view of the American army.
In a letter to General Schuyler, dated Decem-
ber 5, 1775, General Washington says:
" I know that your complaints are too well founded; but
I would willingly hope that nothing will induce you to quit
the service; and that, in time, order and subordination wili
take the place of confusion, and command be rendered more
agreeable."
General Schuyler, in the letter to which thi 
was a reply, had said:
" Nothing can surpass the impatience of the troops from
the New England colonies to get to their firesides. Near
three hundred of them arrived a few days ago unable to do
any duty; but, as soon as I administered that grand specific
—a discharge—they instantly acquired health ; and, rather
than be detained a few days to cross Lake George, they
undertook a march from here of two hundred miles with
the greatest alacrity."
General Washington says in a letter to Gov-
ptnor Reed, of Pennsylvania:
" In the two last weeks we have enlisted but about two
