He spoke not In disparagement of the judges of any of these
courts, but he felt bound to speak without hesitation, that he
might bring public animadversion to bear upon itas a public
grievance, because he was sure the judges might and could cor
rect it Much of the en! might be remedied by the j udges sit
ting a Certain number of days in the yeai, instead of opening
and closing their courts daily, and then paying the marshals,
and tipstaffs, and witnesses and jurors, and attorneys, and other
persons, their full per diem He held up the example of Judge
Gridlei—who presided at the trial of McLeod for fclhe murder of
Durfee at the burning of the Caroline, who did not just open
his court and adjourn, but did a day's business in a day—to all
presiding j udges And what wa3 true of the courts was also
true of Congress He had brought with him a comparative
staterjient^fthe expenditures of Congress, and hé found that
in the administration of Washington, during his eight years,
Congress sat forty eight months, or one half of the whole time

and Jefferson, and he found they sat as many months" as at the

as he was perso lallv concerned, to tt e it tlf of t'ie mo ion, pio

committee, an J espei ia!!v b) him alt to obtm ir nnation 10
detail m relation to t^e estimates fn. thi^ app opuati m, which,
he said, had straek the committee as1 einganen uirio is amount
That information it was found imposeiole to obtain sh )rt of tryo
or three rnoi ths
The evil (Mi F contended) could not be corréete 1 m th s
bill It contamed an appropriation which wis pio?l led foi by
a lstw- which had been on the statute book for f my or f ft/
yean,   It was apparent thatan increase la these expendituies
had been going on for two or three years past w h enovmou*
rapidity Probably one cause of the increase might be found
1,1 the embarrassments which had pervaded the country, and
which hau caused a large increase of prosecutions
Mr T was also undeistood to advento another evil, arising
from the multiplication of suits meases where suns might be
consolidated                                   ,            ,               ,           ,   ,
The remedy for tlwse evil  lay deeper than any thing which
could be done in this hi'l In the first phce, it was necessity
to wke from the district aaorney bis per diem allowance when
he had nothing to do, and was devoting his time to other mat
tera In the second plfco, he must be required to bi mg one
suit only, wheio that could be done And, m the th.ro. place,
when he did not recover Ins cosos, no costs should be pad to
himfrom the Treasury. In this way, not only wou d hia enor
mous fees be much curtailed, but there would be a gieat saving
in the fees of marshals, clerks, jurors, &c 1 his was the con-
clusion to which the committee had come, and they had thought
it impossible to apply the corrective 10 this bill
Mr F alluded to a call which had been made, by a resolu
tuo of the House, on ihe proper lawofheer ol the Government
foi a report on this >ub)ect He (Mr F ) hoped that the repoit
would soon be made—that it would be immediately refened to
the Committee on the Judicial?, and that proper legal pro
visions would be enacted foi the purpose of correcting these
great evils
The aporopuation in this bill w as considerably more than
that for the 11st year This increase (Mr F was understood
to say) was atti ibutable first, to the fact th it there was a defi
ciency ofupwai Is OÍS30 000 m the approoiiationof last year,
and, secondly, tot e fact of additi mal appropriations necessaiy
to eairy out the provisions of thebrankrupt law
Mr F introduced a let'ei from the Serretaiy ofthe Tieasury
(which was lead) to show that this appropriation could not
be reduced                                                         *
He (Mr V ) expressed his entire concurrence in all that had
been said by the gentleman from Pennsylvania rMr Ingersoll]
as to the importance ot legislation on this subject, and he trust-
ed that when the íeport fiom the Department came m it would
receive the early consideration of the House
Mr ADAMS, refernpg to the caee of the "Amistad" negroes,
desired to be mfoimed by the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means [Mr Fillmore] whether that committee had
informed themselves of the amount of thB charges of the dis-
trict attorney and the maishal of the State of Connecticut for
the expense of themamtenance oftho enegroesfor the space of
two y ears, and the additional expenses of the district attorney
himself for chaises foi his Kervioes in carrying through that
prosecution, and for the additional counsel employed for the
puipose of adjudicating that those negroes were slaves, muti
neers, and murdpreisi
Mr A believed that tile meicaseof thisitem of expenditure

Mi HLL\IOKL(scaicJyheaid imidstthenoi e in the Hall)
was undeistood to say that the committee never 'ooked into
the items e\cepf to see whether they coulil not leduce them,
and correct some eul in (he expendituie The objects of ex
pombture the committee supposed to oelong properly toother

was a subject which was ful! of interest to, and ought to at

was this.
He was disposed to think that the Committee of Wavs pnd

The CHAIRMAN then resumed his seat i
Mr I'lf KLNS (after a rema k notheard by the Reporter)
said if the gentleman fro-n Massachusetts (Mr Adams! sup
posed that the Executive had incui led the expenses connected
with the Amistad captives unnecessarily, he begged leave to gay
that the facts ofthe case were very simple, and he had nothing
more to do to vindicate the conduct of the Executive than to
state them He then briefly 1 efcrred to the history of the casa
of the Amistad negroes, and said that the Executive couid have
done no otherwise in 1 elation thereto, and that it wasa proper
"The onfynmaüei, in his opinion, in which the Executive
was blamable was, that he did not execute the treaty ol 85,
and comply with the Spanish íequest, in delivering up those
S dMrS BARNARD said he apprehended that gentlemen had not
considered the vast extentof the judicial system of the United
States, and the necessary expenses to be incurred in the appli-
cation of that system It did not seem to be well considered
that the judicial system of the United Stales extended over
twenty six States of the Union, three Territories, and the Dia-
tret of Columbia, and we had a Supreme Court consisting of
nine judges each holding, according to law, two circuits in a
year Here was the simple fact statedby (he gentleman from
Pennsylvania [Mr C J Ingehsoix] that the expenses of the
ludicial system in New York city and the District of Columbia
a one anounted to about $100,000, excluding the expenses
of the Supreme Court Whether this was too much -or
too little he was not prepared to say without some ex-
amination The expenses m these two places must necessarily
be immense
Was the gentleman from Pennsylvania, or any other member,
prepared to say that for the year to come, and without any ie
gislationos their pait to reduce the recessary expenditures,
this sum, as pioposed by the Committee of Ways and Means,
was too la gel If «o, how much much too largei The gentle-
man fiom Pennsylvania struck he had said atrandom He
thinks the amountS100ÜOO too laigo Why not guessitwas
too large by 4?00 000 or 8301,000? He (Mr J3 ) confessed he
did not like ranuom legislation, and it was pauicularly unfor
túnate to apply random legislation to the subject of the Judi
ciary Would they have the courts stopped for want of the
necessary means to carry them/ml   And if so, where1
He was disposed to believe that by a proper system, adopted '
after careful examination ofthe whole subject, and by the adop.
tlon of proper checks of expenses, now leu so much to the dis-
cretion of district attorneys and &ubordmate officeis, that thla
system of expeidilure might be reduced a very considerate
sum—perhaps to one third of its present amount, but, because
that was his opinion, he wou'd not vote for this amendment
They had not adopted the means by which they were to bung
down this amount It was they n ho were to do it He could
suggest a single item that wou d bring down the amount great.
Iy, that was, that the bil's now to be exan med by the district
judges, and which occupy so much of their time, should be ex-
amined, as, for instance for marshal's fees bythee'erk.
Mr C J IiNGBRSOLLwas understood to Eay thatthlfl was
the casein the courts of Pennsylvania
Mr BaRInARD If it wasso, it was not required and it was
not done in the District of Co umbia Be had understood tl e
gentleman f om Pennsylvania to complain that the judges did
not hold their courts long enough during the day There were
ro nine dray hoises that perfoimed more labor, accord ng to
their pbyaica! capacity than the nine judges of the Supreme
Court during its sessions
They had tins large judicial system extending all over the
United States The expenses of it ought to be cut down, but
not m this way it was not the proper place for this on an an*
propiiation bill They had just passed an amendmentwhich,
he ventured to say, would be exceedingly mischievous m 11a
effects
The CfiAIRM\\called the o-entleman to order, as discuss
mg an amendment which had already been adopted
Mr BARNARD had not entered on the discussion of that
amendment, but alluded to it bv way of mere Illustration, to
show that 'fthis corr-eof has'y legislation were pursued, they
would go on ftom one evil to ano her The gentlen an ,had
sa>d that tl e courts must «us'ani themselves Did the eentle-

pnn'ing the records, showmgits great importance ai d eoi tend-
ing that al'housh it occasioned constierable expense, it cou'd
not be disposed with He knew that propositions to retrench
expenses 11 any quarter, m the present composition of parties,
were very likely to be adopted He was m favor of al! posa ble
and propel ie íenchment, but was opposed to this mode. He
thought it dangerous, leading to lrfimte mischief, and beginning:
at the wrong end They were told by the chairman o the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means that this subiect was under investí
gation—that it had been sent to the proper offcer of tins Go-

in which ltmigot Intel igiory he acted on, and m that way a
