are to have more troops here, the supply of rations and ammunition, I think, should be moved to Nashville. I can hold the fort against 5,000 rebels, but the post is too small to hold stores.

HEADQUARTERS,Cincinnati, Ohio, June 3, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch received. Rosecrans is now relying upon my advance into Tennessee, and I am all ready. If I do not go there, some 8,000 or 10,000 men might be spared for Grant. Rosecrans has just telegraphed me that he is moving, and wants me to push on. I leave for Hickman Bridge at daylight to-morrow. Telegraph me at Lexington.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

CINCINNATI, June 3, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

General Halleck has asked me how many troops I can send to Grant, and I am expecting orders that will interfere with the East Tennessee movement; will telegraph you. I leave this morning for Lexington. Telegraph me there.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, June 3, 1863-11 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE, Lexington, Ky.:

You will immediately dispatch 8,000 men to General Grant, at Vicksburg. Should it be found that General Grant will not require them, they will be stopped by the way or returned to you as early as possible. Concentrate your remaining forces as much as you can. I think there is no fear of an advance upon Kentucky at present.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

LEXINGTON, June 3, 1863.

General ROSECRANS:

Halleck has ordered me to send a large force to Grant, which I am now doing. Will keep Hartsuff as compact as possible. You know my line is long. I will not send a bearer of dispatches now, as my plans are all deranged.

BURNSIDE.

LEXINGTON, KY.,

June 3, 1863-2.25 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

The two divisions of the Ninth Corps go. Shall I go with them? Hartsuff is concentrating the troops, and can look about for matters here, and I will have nothing to do. I may be able to help Grant.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
