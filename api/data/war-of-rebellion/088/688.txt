September 4, 1864.

Colonel ROBERT McALLISTER,

Commanding Third Brigade:

COLONEL: I am directed by the brigadier-general commanding to inform you that it is reported that General Early is coming down and will likely make an attack on or near the Jerusalem plank road. You will perfect the abatis in your front and around the fort. A good commander will be selected for the fort and a garrison of 600 men for the same. It may be necessary to withdraw the rest of your forces, with the exception of your picket-line, at any moment. In the meanwhile keep your men at work as above, and have the ground cleared as well as practicable to allow the forts to have a fair sweep. Any old breastworks in your front will be destroyed.

J. H. LOCKWOOD,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

You will instruct your picket to be very watchful and your men vigilant, and report promptly to these headquarters any movements or changes of the enemy.
