They will be prepared to make the movement with sixty rounds of ammunition and four days' short rations on the person. I am also directed to inform you that the cavalry force in your front has been removed, but that the roads approaching it are scouted and patrolled.

General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

A messenger will leave here in a few moments with an answer to your note of last evening. Please defer the matter of supplies for the works you allude to until you receive the note.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 7, 1864-9 a.m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the commanding general to say in answer to your note of 11.30 [11] p.m. last evening, that should it become necessary to hold the line of intrenchments depending principally on the inclosed works it is not proposed to hold the works in the rear to the left of Fort Cummings. In the event of the happening of the contingency alluded to, probably much the same arrangements would be made as were adopted at the time the army moved in the direction of the South Side Railroad. For the present,however, the commanding general thinks it best to have garrisons and artillery in the rear works of your line, including Fort Dushane.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
