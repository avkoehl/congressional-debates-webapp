up and down the Sequatchie. There is also another force some 7 miles higher up the valley. People with whom Major Foster conversed thought the enemy was making up the valley. These reports of citizens not known are good for naught.

Major Foster also reports no water from the foot of the mountain this side to the foot on the other side, a distance of 15 miles. A small party sent to Beersheba Springs were told by citizens that a rebel force 1,500 strong (cavalry) was encamped yesterday on Big Creek, 6 or 7 miles from Altamont toward Dunlap. Heard from General Mc-Cook at Altamont last night. Has captured two of Bragg's body guard, who report that he has a large force, but not yet in the Sequatchie Valley. His cavalry thinks he has a division there.

News from all sources seems to confirm the report of the citizens from Livingston, Tenn., that the enemy will move his main force by Sparta. If he is moving on Murfreesborough by Sparta I think the sooner we concentrate to meet him and drive him back the better, and Murfreesborough seems to be the point form which we should operate.

It would be very advantageous if one brigade was stationed at Smithville to watch any movement of the enemy on our left flank, as there seems to be some probability of a movement on my left and rear if the enemy can assemble force enough for that purpose.

Colonel W. GROSE,

Commanding Tenth Brigade, Murfreesborough:

March at once with your entire brigade to this point, keeping a good lookout for the enemy in the vicinity of Woodbury. It is not necessary to bring up the supply train. Commissary stores were sent by railroad.

General McCOOK, Altamont:

Your note was received last night at 11 o'clock. I have no orders to supply you with rations, and I have barely enough for three days. Send to Decherd. If you remain at Altamont I will make arrangements to supply you. Crittenden is to be at Hillsborough to-day, and I have orders to be ready to move at any moment and keep no supplies on hand.

The enemy's cavalry attacked a stockade on this railroad yesterday; got whipped, losing 15 killed and 7 wounded.

Wood went out yesterday with all of his brigade toward Dunlap; captured a rebel officer, negro, and hotel-keeper, and late Chattanooga papers. Bragg is not in the Sequatchie yet. Forrest is said to be in Hubbard's Cove. Will get after him to-night. Look out; he will probably try to escape by Altamont.

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
