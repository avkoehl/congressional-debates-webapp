APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

24th Cowg....1st Sess.            Slavtry in the District of Columbia—Mr. Goldsborough.
Senate.
One of the most productive sources of the evil
against which we are contending, and the chief
impediment to successful resistance, is, I am per-
suaded, to be found in the misapprehensions
which are entertained both by the slaveholding
and non-slaveholding States in relation to the real
state of things existing in each. Under the ex-
citing circumstances in which the people in the
slaveholding States are placed, it is not to be
wondered at that they should regard every man
who signs one of these petitions as an enthusiast,
or a foe to their peace. Yet surely, in life, many
of these men arc considered and known to be of
good intelligence and inoffensive habits. So, on
the other hand, there are very many in the non-
slaveholding States who, untaught by any prac-
tical views of their own as to the real state and
condition of things generally existing in- the slave-
holding States, have indulged themselves, ab-
stractly in reflections on slavery, and have thrown
around it all the glooms and horrors that heated
imaginations could depict, or the fancies of others
could furnish; and thus they find themselves led
on to a crusade to do that to which a wounded
sensibility prompts, without the power or the
thought to calculate the greater miseries that must
result from their interference. In no instance— ''
and I have known many—where an intelligent j
man from the North has come to the South, with-
out any other impressions of negro slavery than |
those formed in his ownr fancy at a distance, have
I ever known him to be otherwise than completely
astonished and gratified at the real condition oF
thing*. Instead of meeting with his supposed
squalid, trembling, ill-treated set -of beings, he
findsacheerful, well-conditioned, laboring people,
with a body of lively and kindly-treated domestic
servants.; in fact, instead of abject and tyran-
nically-abused slaves, he finds a happy, well-
trained peasantry, who divide with their masters
a good portion of the products of then* labor, and j
who, unlike other peasantry, are not left to
chances and accident for their support, but,
through all accident and chance, are sustained
and protected by the means, the care, and the
favor of their masters. In this state of things I
desire to address myself particularly to the hon-
orable Senators upon this floor from the non-
slaveholding States, and, through them, to the
people themselves, if what I say here shall be
deemed worthy to reach their ear on this all-ab-
sorbing question; and I need net declare how
much I crave their pardon and their favor for
this direct appeal.
Upon the constitutional question involved in
this subject it is not my purpose particularly to
dwell; but I may occasionally advert to it in my
progress; since the views I entertain on that point
nave been so ably enforced and finely illustrated
by otheis, as to render anything more unneces-
sary and superfluous; besides, that part of the
question does not, at this time, enter- into my
views; I mean to appeal to another powerful di-
rector in matters of this sort—the social tie as
cemented between us by mutual interests, sound
common sense, and love of justice; and with this
intent I will refer to the origin and character of
the government over this little District of Co-
lumbia,,whose agency is invoked by the petition-
ers to establish a system that would, if adopted,
inevitably spread disquiet and destruction in the
.proximate neighborhoods, and through them into
the whole South.
It is a part of the history of this Federal Gov-
.ernmeot of ours, that is familiar to all who hear
me, that the clause in the Constitution which es-
tablishes the seat of the General Government in
this District of Columbia, ten mile  square, was
not contained in the original draft of that instru-
ment, but was inserted afterwards upon the sug-
gestion of the expediency of the matter, founded
upon a fact which had taken place in Philadelphia
towards the latter end of the revolutionary war,
when the old Congress was insulted, ana their
deliberations threatened to be overawed by a
turbulent mob; and the police of Philadelphia at
that time being either too weak or too timid to
afford them the necessary protection, Congress
found it necessary to remove to Trenton, in New
Jersey, and afterwards to Annapolis, in Mary-
land, for security trom disturbance. This goes
to show that the exclusive object of extending
this Government over the District of Columbia
was for the single purpose of enabling Congress
to protect its members from insult, and to guard
their deliberations upon the national concerns
from interruption and all overawing influence,
and for no other purpose.
The site for" this District was selected by the
great founder of the Republic, embracing a por-
tion of country on either bank of the Potomac,
within those portions of the States of Virginia
and Maryland that were then among the most
slaveholding parts of those two slaveholding
States, and which have since undergone no ma-
terial change. The cession was made by those
States, and agreed to by the persons holding the
territory ceded, no doubt from motives of patriot-
ism and pride, as well as from the hopes of various
future advantages. Bringing with them their own
laws as a part of the compact of cession, subject
to such future changes as they might find useful
for their local and other circumstances, and stip-
ulating for the security of property, they looked
to nothing else, they never had a thought of any-
thing else, than that all changes that might be
made by Congress would affect their domestic
relations, their property, their habits, would alone*
proceed from their own suggestion, dictated by
their owii wants and their own judgment, in re-
lation to their own exclusive concerns; they never
dreamed that they were to be subject to a legisla-
tion dictated by others on whom the effect of that
legislation was not to fall. Could it be presumed
that the independent citizens of independent States
would ever have consented to have exchanged a
legislation over their personal rights and prop-
erty, by representatives chosen by and responsi-
ble to themselves, for the exclusive legislation of
a Congress, irresponsible to them,, if subject to
be directed by the petitions and wishes of others,
who had neither a common residence nor a com-
mon interest with them) It could not have been
expected. They never, never had an idea about
external interference to introduce laws and sys-
tems to bind them and their property, foreign to
their habits, conflicting with their established in-
terests, and inconsistent with the happiness and
comfort of whieh they felt themselves secure in
.the'esjoyment; nor did the probability of such a
thing ever occur to others.
Upon this plain view of the state of things,
I turn to the intelligence of the North and of the
West, and of the whole non-slaveholding coun-
try, and I put it. to their generous social feeling,
and I ask them, is it right, is it just, is it friendly
in them, merely for the indulgence of a feeling
upon the abstract question of slavery, to try to
influence Congress, who have the exclusive legis-
lation, over this District, to force upon their fel-
low-citizens in this District a system of things
uncongenial with their habits, inconsistent with
their wishes and interests, and adverse to their
views; which, at the same time, spreads alarm,
excites dissatisfaction and hostile feeling through
all the neighboring and similarly situated States ?
When they see that the people of the District,
whom they desire immediately to affect, are averse
to it; and when they see hundreds of thousands
of their intelligent fellow-citizens, who must be
inevitably mediately affected by it, thrown into
consternation, and agitated to desperation at the
very demonstration of their designs; what mo-
tive can they find in charity, in benevolence, or
in any of all the Christian virtues, to justify a
perseverance in a cause that is to be a hateful
source of strife fed by blood ? Let me entreat
them to pause and to forbear. They have nothing
to risk or to pledge on the result, Whilst we risk
everything. They desire to gratify a sentiment,
whilst we have all at risk that is dear to the heart
of man—our country, our wives, our children,
friends and home, and, what would be insup-
portable in the loss of these, our uves; weigh
these stakes and risks in the balance, and then
let their calmed Christian spirit speak. I cannot
doubt their intelligence; I will not distrust their
generous moral sentiment, nor their pious benev-
olence.
Allow me to propound a case to their consider-
ation, as we sometimes are enabled to bring things
home to our understandings and our hearts mote
strongly by the illustration of a converse proposi-
tion. Suppose the site for the District in which
the seat of Government was to have been placed,
had been selected in Pennsylvania, or in some
other neighboring non-slaveholding State; and,
after Congress had been long established there,
and the inhabitants of the District had become
fixad in their habits, with everything adjusted to
their own taste and wishes, and to those of the
proximate and neighboring States, that the peo-
ple of the South should have taken up the opin-
ion that it would be much more agreeable to them,
much more suitable to their habi-ts and mode of
life, if slavery could be introduced into that Dis-
trict, and that they were, in consequence of this
sentiment, to send in petitions to Congress, year
after year.from all quarters of the South, to estab-
lish slavery in that District, would the Senators
and Representatives from the non-slaveholding
States, or the people themselves in those States,
give ear for a moment to such petitions > Cer-
tainlynot. And why? Beeause their object would
be .to interfere with the established system ef
things already existing, with which those imme-
diately to be affected,and those around them, were
content, and which they preferred, and because
it would produce a change that they deprecated,
as unsuited to their views as it would be contrary
to their wishes. Yet -this is but the converse of
the state of things that the petitioners desire to
bring about, when, to gratify a sentiment that
they have imbibed, in contemplating slavery at a
distance, as it is supposed to exist among us,
they endeavor to prevail upon Congress to force
us against our will, and against our best judg-
ment as to our own security and peace, to derange
our whole social system by a revolution that wa
are morally certain will be pregnant with calam-
ities that make tho heart sicken to contemplate.
Peculiar opinions may be found to exist in
various parts of our extended country, arising
from education, habits, local position, or other
causes, for which we may entertain a predilection
founded in early impressions, and strengthened
by association; and perhaps it might be quite
natural that, under the influence of this devotion,
we might feel a strong disposition- to transplant
such opinions elsewhere, where we might sap-
pose they would become as useful and satisfac-
tory to others as they are to 'ourselves. This
design may be innocent in its conception, and
perhaps benevolent; yet, before We attempt to
press it upon others, we ought at least to consult
their wishes, a*nd to consider all the circumstances
with which they are surrounded. Sentiments like
these may probably have worked up a zealous
sort of sense of duty to eradicate a system in the
District of Columbia, and, through its influente
| there, in 'the adjoining southern States, that is
regarded at a distance by those who have hat
little practical acquaintance with it, as an evil and
a wrong; and looking upon'Cbrigress as the Le-
gislature of the Union, to which all have.access,
for the purpose of making known their wishes,
they think they may claim a right to give effect
to their wishes through the course of proceeding
in that body. But if the exercise of this sup-
posed right, thus claimed, is destined, in the be-
lief of all who are to be affected by it, to disturb
the rights of property as sanctioned by law and
long-establishéd usage, to break up most incon-
veniently and injuriously an established State of
things, and to epread abroad jast causes for alarm
and danger to personal peace and safety, can it
be consistent with sound discretion, or with a
benevolent fellow-feeling, or is it legal, to attempt
a revolution that is calculated to produce such
effects ? • Why is it that I am prohibited by law
from exercising my fuH right of ownership and
of absolute right over my property in a hems 
which adjoins my neighbor's, by putting it oat
of the way, by burning it down, with « yiew to
my improvements ? The house is my own abso-
lutely, but it is not suited to my taste, and is an
impediment to the indulgence of what I think
would greatly add to the embellishment and value
of all around. Is not the answer ready and ob-
vious?   Because I must exercise my own rights
