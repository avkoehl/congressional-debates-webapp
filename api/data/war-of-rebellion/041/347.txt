HEADQUARTERS TROOPS IN THE FIELD,New Iberia, November 20, 1863-11.30 a. m.

The affair this morning at Camp Pratt was very handsome and complete. The cavalry went out the Abbeville road, and struck the Vermillion road about 1 mile in rear of Camp Pratt. A brigade of infantry (Cameron's) and four guns went out on the Vermillion road. Both bodies arrived about daylight, shot the vedettes, and came upon the enemy entirely by surprise, surrounding him entirely.

The regiment is the Sixth [Seventh] Texas [Cavalry], commanded by Colonel Bagby. He, however, now commands a brigade at Vermillion. The lieutenant-colonel (P. T. Herbert) was absent and the major escaped. The prisoners are 12 commissioned officers and 100 men, precisely.

The cavalry went as far as half-way to Vermillion, dispersed the Second Louisiana Cavalry (rebel), and have now returned. The result shows there is not much force this side of Vermillion. About 25 of Bagby's regiment escaped.

For the last three days the telegraph wire has been cut at several places. Yesterday it was repaired, but was cut immediately after the repair was finished.

Yesterday morning, before daylight, three parties of our cavalry arrived at Dauterive's Landing, and at a camp of conscripts and guerrillas near there. The camp was entirely surprised, and we captured 3 officers and 30 men, besides a quantity of arms and horses. Two of the rebels were killed. Our loss was nothing. One object of the expedition was to catch Major [St. L.] Dupeire, who is raising the rebel battalion to which these prisoners belong, but he had left the house where his wife was staying about an hour before we surrounded it. Parties have been out after the persons who cut the wire, but none have been caught yet.

Very respectfully, yours,

W. B. FRANKLIN,

Major-General, Commanding.

GENERAL: As the present campaign has given me some experience as to the best manner of holding this section of the country, I beg leave respectfully to submit my views on the subject, for the consideration of the general commanding the department.

I find that an infantry force is very hard to move on account of the scarcity of supplies, and, when moved, is of but little use. The enemy is nearly entirely mounted, and if he pursues the course hereafter which he has adopted for this campaign, the system of warfare will be merely that of annoyance. In no case will he risk a general battle, unless his
