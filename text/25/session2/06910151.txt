Making public officers depositaiies—Mr. Strange.

sonmg wuh suspicion In this respect it resembles
confidence a man confide , because he will con-
fide , and he suspects, because he will suspect.
It is further objected to the Independent Treasuiy,
that it increases Executive patronage We have
heard a great deal of humbugs upon this floor ,
but of all the humbugs which hn\e ever come
under my obsetva'ion, this it, the merest
Already the o3 cts hoideu at the will of the
Executive exceed ten thousand, and oui feais are
uddenlv appealed to upon th« addition of twenty
Pub .o liberty is peifectlj safe with a. coips of lea
thousand office holdcis, but ten thousand and twen-
ty threaten its immediate annihilation Sir, I say
again, as I have said before, that, undei our institu-
tions, an open and acknowledged pationageisa
principle of weakness, rather than of power, to him
who wields it I feel it in my own humble sphere
My situation here entitle  my opinions to some lit
t'e respect m the appointment of officers in my own
State, and I am, ot course, occasionally ipphed to
on that ground by those who desire them In the
discharge of my legislative duties, my constituents
and I understand each othei psriecily, they know
■tthat course I am likely to take upon sny great
measure, and theie is nodisippointment Butinthe
exercise of the little influence I possess in the distri-
bution of offices it is different For one whom I have
it m my power to gratify, I am forced to disap-
point ten, and I am more fortunate than I expect to
be if those whom I cannot oblige do not impute my not
doing so,some to ingratitude,some to a want of adue
sense of their merits, some to a w i«h to accomplish ob-
jectsof my own,and others to a want of that influence
which a more ablentan in my place would command
In either view I have madi a bad birgun, and have
lost much more thin I have gained Such, m a much
larger spheie, is the situation of the Piesident But
that is not all, his appointments, when made, do
not always add strength to his administration So
far as my experience goes, the mass of applicants
for office are from the ranks of the Opposition, and
their feelings ot opposition, though temporarily
smothered, ate seldom appeased, but <ue certain to
show themsehes on the fitst occasion ol tm), and
the instances aie far moic numerous of those who
receivid office while pic fessing attachment to the
^duiinistritiun altTwaids becoming its opponents,

to it ichmc it "lid advocacy Cut w! at is true ol
open and undisguised pitiomp/i, is not true c í th U
secret and complicated influence which miv le
eterei ed through the banks, whenever the obje Is
of the administration and ot the banks become
identified Agent  of this influence stilt up, like
Rhodenck Dhu's men, from behind every bush,
and their appals can be addressed m ihe most sub-
tle, and vet, in appeaiance, most innocent forms
Take a single matinee A member of tins, or one
of the State Legislatures, is debtor to a hank,
and a measure of gieat imporl mce is pend-
ing befóte t ic legislative body—those most con-
versant in bank afi nrs choose to suppose tint
n «ill in imp way maten illy afftct bml
ing interests and the general conversation upon
the subject inculcates that belief A bank of-
ficer has occasion to write to this member merely
to inform him that on such a day his note will be
due, but, as he has his pen in his hind, hp aids
"Themeasme now under consideration in >oui
body, if it becomes a law, will, it is thought, create
a necessity for the banks to curtail their issues,
and the debtors will, of course, be required to pay
up their notes in full " Now, there is nothing
wron" in all this, but what is the effect upon tne
recipient of the letter' A perfectly natural one
His thoughts take a new direction "ltistiue,"
h- says to himself, " I had intended to have voted
for this measure, and supposed it a beneficial one ,
but ui that I may be mistaken , and if it is te affect
the banks as stated in this letter, the consequences
to myself are appalling I am not able to pay up
this note, without the sauifice of all thit I possess
My wife will be reduced to beggary, and the pros-
pects oí my little ones forever blighted The ha-
zard is too great I o-nnot encounter it." So
woull reason, under these circumstances, a man
who had not the integrity of Arises, with the
firmness ot Socrates    Sir, we all feel this bank
influence pervading the very atmosphere we
breathe The filaments of its attiaction insinuate
themselves every where, into the most secret and
retired places , and every man feels himself drawn
on this side, and upon that, by some subtle power
of which he is scarcely conscious
I now proceed to the consideration of the subject
as connected with commerce and political econo-
my I am not induced to take this view from any
belief of my own, that it is pertinent to the present
investigation, but our fnends on the other side
have obtruded it upon us, and by pressing it them-
sehes in debate, have made it necessaiy for us to
meet them upon thai ground I insist, as I did at
the extra session, that the President was right m
his opinion of the obligations of this Government,
m relation to the currency I deny that the Go-
vernment is bound to fumtsh or regulate any other
currency than that of gold and silver, nay, I deny
i s light to do so Sir, the word currency is not m
the whole Constitution, although a late fellow travel-
ler of high respectability, who had been recently
reading the speech of the Senator from Massachu-
setts, [Mr Webstar,] delivered at the last session
of Cc ngress, insisted that it was I ventured mo-
destly to put in my dissent to this opinion of my
fellow-traveller, but to no effect, and as the argu-
ment grew warmer, he finally brought the weighty
authority of the Senator from Massachusetts to
bear upon me, and declared that that gentleman
was unrivalled in his knowledge of constitutional
law, and that any man who would read his
speech must be satisfied that it was there I was
forced to admit, as I do now, that any man who
was not himself acquainted with the Constitution,
and would read the speech of the Senator, would
come to the conclusion that the word currency was
in the Constitution, and yet I admit that the hono-
rable Senator from Massachusetts did not say that
the word currency was there He derives the au-
thority of Congress over the currency, and the obh-
gition to regulate u, from the third clause of the
í ighih section of the first article, which declares
that Congress shall have power "to regulate com-
merce with foreign nations and among the several
States," &c and this, he says, coupled with the
sen cnteenth clause of the same section and article,
gives to Congress the power to create and regulate
(lie means of commerce I did understand the
Senator, at ihe last session, to insist that the words
regnl ite and create ofttn meant the same thing,
and, if my memory se¡ ves me, he offered some ex-
amples to piove it But, sir, if the meanings of
words arc to be thus confounded, it seems to me
that language loses ill its utility, and words, cease
to be as they were designed—the vehicles of ideas
"God created the heavens and the earth," and
his light to regulate them, grows out of his
creative power. But yet the two rights or
powers are altogether distinct One of them he has
tuinsferred, to some extent, to man, and given him
dominion ovci the fish of the sea, and ovei the
fowls of the air, and over eveiy living thing thatcreep-
e h upon the earth " But his creative power ísun
communicated, and perhaps incommunicable But
teluiiug the Senator from any verbal criticisms,
ind even granting him his premises, namely, that
Congress, undei the Constitution, has power to re-
gulite commerce, and, under the seventeenth clause
of ti e eighth section of the first article, to furnish
such medium of commerce as may be necessary for
its legulation, his conclusion will not follow, for the
necessity does not exist, upon which his superstruc-
ture rests, and, of course, that supertructure
must fall to the ground The best medium on earth
for commerce is already provided, and there is no
necessity for another. But if this matter could be
reduced to a mere question of commercial expe-
diency, I deny that Congress ought to connect her
fiscal affans with the local banks Who applies
the scourge to the flying courser? And snch would
be the effect of Government continuing the stimu-
lus of her deposites, and receipt of bank paper,
wilh the local institutions But I know it will be
said she is invited to apply the rem, and not the
scourge Sir, this is a ruinous fallacy It is, in lact,
an invitation to place both the scourge and theiem
m irresponsible hands, and with the power to use
them with the wildest discretion, or, rather, without
any discretion at all. Ana a scourgeit would piove
to the whole country. The Independent Treasury
system proposes nothing more than to withdraw the
stimulus which the Government has heretofore
given to a system she has neither the right nor tha
power to control, and leave it to ihe action of those
laws to which it is properly subject, law> founded
on the eternal principles of truth and nature, and
by which it will certainly, in the end, be properly
guided But the soundest principles ot Govern-
ment are at war with any connection with the
paper system. Fluctuation is one of the most pro-
minent characteristics of that system, in proof of
which, if any is required, I will read an extract
from the last April number of the Edinburgh Re-
view, pages 33 and 34
"There might, indeed, and most probably would be com
mercial revulsions and a fall of the exchange, even, though the
currency were wholly metallic, or fluctuated exactly as a. me
tdtlic currency would do, but there is not the eligtitest reason
for supposing that thev would be eithei halt so frequent or
severe, as under the exiting system    A mixed currency  or a
cuircncy of coin and paper, supplied like that ot England is
expo ed to fluctuations m us amount and capacity of transact
tug business, ten times greater than any that could attach to a
purety metallic currency or to a mixed currency fluctuating
according to the demand for bullion     ÍÍ the currency t onsisted
wholly oí gold, of if no additional supplies ol pap* could be
obtained except upon the dep03ire of an equivalent amount of
gold, no general rise of prices could take place, except when
there was an influx of the precious metals and these, as every
one knows, cannot be accumulated in any one country to a
much more considerable degree than in others    But when wdi
viduals or associations are allowed to issue notes, or paper fined
to serve all the purposes of money, not upon a deposite of bul
lion, but merely upon their receiving a promise to repay it with
interest at some futu-e period, a new and most powerful element
of variation is brought into the field "
Mr Locke, one of the most profound writers in
the English language, has said- " It is the interest
of every country that the standard of its money,
once settled, should inviolably and immutably be
kept to perpetuity, for whenever that is altered,
from what pretence soever, the public will l®se by
it Men, in their bargains, contract not for deno-
minations or sounds, but for intrinsic value " I
know that Mr Locke is here speaking of an altera-
tion by the arbitrary action of the Govern-
ment. But the consequences of alteration will
follow as certainly, by whatever poner it may
be brought about. But if the Government adopts the
paper system, the principle of fluctuation will be in-
corporated in the money of the country by the Govern-
ment itself, and the alteration of its standard u ill
be the act of the Government. One of the most
serious evils of this fluctuation is the sudden
change it produces in the condition of men The
paper system, in addition to its tendency to
fluctuation, increases this latter evil also by the en-
couragement it gives to speculation, and by ihe
joint operation of these two causes men are con-
tinually rising suddenly from povertv lo wealth,
and sinking from wealth to poverty Mutability is
one of the worst features in human destiny, and is
always reckoned among the chief ills of life. Men
become accustomed to any state or condition, and
fitted to avail themselves of its enjoyments, what-
ever they may be, and to bear the ills attendant
upon it A gradual improvement of a man's con-
dition is healthful both to the soul and body, and a
gradual deterioration may be borne with philo-
sophical composure, and without any very percep-
tible loss of comfort. But any sudden revulsion
either way is attended always with many painful
incidents. Even where the change, humanly
speaking, ts for the better, it is seldom attended
with real happiness The heir of poverty, who is
suddenly advanced in fortune, has rarely any of
hose qualifications which fit him fonts enjojrnem
He is removed from the circles and associations
which were wont to engage his affections, and
thrown into others with which his heart knows no
sympathy. But who can paint the misery of him
who, reared to better hopes, has lived under sunny
skies and amid bright prospects, and suddenly
finds himself overwhelmed with pecuniary ruin'
Time will not allow us to follow out this fruitful
and affecting theme
But another great evil of the paper system is,
that it causes the producers of the country to sell at
specie prices, and buy at paper prices, or m otner
words U buy at prices, regulated by an inflated cut-
rency, and sell at those which are regulated [y a
stable currency Gentlemen affect not to see the
force of this argument, and ask whether the plante ,
