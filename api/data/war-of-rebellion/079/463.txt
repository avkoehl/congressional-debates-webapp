Major General W. T. S HERMAN,

Gaylesville, Ala.:

A prisoner detached as a scout fromone of Wheeler's regiments near Gadsden says Hood marched from that place, the first corps at 4 a. m., the second at dayLight, and THIRD at noon last Saturday. That they had speech making all thenight before in which everybody was informed that they were going to GUnt4r's Landing; ' clothing, &c., were issued. Citizens confirm this story. I have sent a regiment up the east bank of the creek with instructions to go to Ladiga and beyond. Another to go through Godhen and Cross Plains, a d as far toward Jacksonville as possible, to bring in every man, horse, or mule they can find, and to ascertain positibvely what is at Blue Muntian. Wheeler was atGdsden on Monday, and had two DIVISIONS at Turkeytown when Garrard was there on Tuesday. Jackson seems to be yet between here and the railroad.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
