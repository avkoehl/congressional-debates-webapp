HDQRS. LEFT WING, ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Glasgow, Ky., September 14, 1862.

Colonel JOSEPH WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

COLONEL: Your communication of the 13th instant has been received, and in reply I am directed by Major-General Hardee to say he has for you only the general instructions to picket strongly the Bowling Green road and to keep him well advised of all movements of the enemy. He wishes you to employ secret agents to penetrate the enemy's lines at Bowling Green and obtain information of his force, position, probable movements, &amp;c. The general would further direct your attention, to the Bowling Green and Louisville road via Brownsville, which is a shorter road by 9 miles than that leading by Munfordville, and should be watched.

Very respectfully,

T. B. ROY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Camp near Proctor's Station, Ky., September 14, 1862-9 a.m.

Major D. E. HUGER,

Asst. Adjt. General, Reserve Division, near Glasgow, Ky.:

MAJOR: No further attempt was made by the enemy to pass during the night. A strict watch will be kept upon them during the day, and the point to which they came yesterday will be guarded and the road in the rear of it will be cut off if they come up again. None of the couriers whom I have sent to you have returned, so that I am not sure that I am in communication with division headquarters. Will you therefore please return the bearer as soon as practicable, to satisfy me on this point. Please send me a few large envelopes.

Very, respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. K. DUNCAN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded. This communication was received before the indorsement on report of the major-general, but the fact had not been made known to me, through negligence in my assistant adjutant-general's office.

J. M. WITHERS,

Major-General, Commanding Reserve Division.
