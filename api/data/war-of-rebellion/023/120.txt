J. T. BOYLE,

I hope we may be able to cut off their retreat.

Military Governor.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 10, 1862.

General NEGLEY, Columbia:

Colonel Board's cavalry has been ordered from Savannah to Columbia. It must go at once to Murfreesborough. Send orders to it to this effect by special messenger and escort and inform me as soon as possible of the whereabouts of the regiment. It should be near Columbia by this time if it got the orders to march at proper time.
