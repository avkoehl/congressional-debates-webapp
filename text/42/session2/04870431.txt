Hi). OF
pay for building a road, and be can tell what
he, thinks of paying $30,000 a mile for a £ r 
road.
One of the most intelligent witnesses tes-
tified that while he admitted the road was an
important one, $1,000 would ha-ve put it in good
repair. Other testimony proved tbatthe mac-
adamizing should not have exceeded $2,600 a
mile, or $12,500 for the whole. And here
comes in another coincidence, as striking as
some of those previously mentioned, that the
stone was oblained from the quarries of a son
of a member of the board. To be sure, his
father warned the young gentleman not to
engage in this business, but he disobeyed that
parental instruction. Politics was, however,
at the bottom of most of the extrayagance.
Men were engaged according to their political
views and discharged if they were faotious.
A single line of testimony settles the entire
case:
" Question. You say that your list had on it four or
fiye hundred men?
" Answer. At the tjine pf the ejection therp vrerp
on that road nearly five hundred meru
" Question. How long were they kept on after the
election?
"Answer. Very little. Thpy .cpiumotyced dis-
charging them immediately after."

all this about election time. The excuse is tjie
§a'me in both cases—anxiety to finish (,jie work
before winter. How fortunate for this cla^
of politicians that elections do not take plq.ee
in the spring 1 To be sure, tbeauxigty ceases
with the election, phe men are dismi^ed, the
work stops, and the joad remains impassible,

is true that this particular road vy*$S put pf

As .ftp.,evidence of the way in which tfcfl

the (blip wing from the testimony:

Street improvement.
1 know' that, every morning
previous to the election, when I would go on tb$
road, a good many ot" thd colored meii would corns
to mo and say that Mr. Hall had threatened to dis-
charge them if they did not vofe fqr him. That
would be the cry everyniorning until just before the
election. At a meeting held by our elub at Port
Sfoouui. Mr. Hall beine present, I preterrod thiq
charge aKauist him. lie said that lie told these men
he would dibcharso thorn if they did notvotQ ' wjth

Another great source of expenditure was the
grading of the streets find roads, and in thess
care seems to b%ve been taken in selection of
places, for these operations were undertaken
where themostharm and the least good to
be apcoroplished. To raise or lower a street ft
few feet is a serious matter; it may cut off front
doors or shut up cellar windows; it will surely
ruixx appearances and cause much pntlay for
alterations if it does not seriously interfere
with communications. Such changes were
apparently made merely for the pleasure of
the thing; some streets were tirst raised and
then lowered and theu raised again, giving
the dwellers along them a cheerful variety of
experiences and requiring much activity to
keep their jiouses habitable. With every such
alteration, all trees, those unsurpassable and
slowly-produced ornaments of a city, are de-
stroyed, sidewalks have to be taken up and
relaid, areas and dopr-steps must be readjusted,
and inuch general expense and inconveniencB
are sure to be occasioned. But the enterpris-
ing members of the board were not satisfied
with such moderate annoyances j in occasional
bursts of enthusiasm tjiey filled up to a depth
of thirty feet, buried houses to thsir roofs,
and rendered utterly worthless sqnares upon
squares of dwellings and stores; they cut
down into the bowels of the earth twelve to
fifteen feet, and lef(; houses parched op pin-
nacles like' warnings to rash 'builders against
trusting their investments in such a commun-
ity. Washington and Georgetown ate built
on a suocession of hills; it is almost a mount-
ainous eoqptry, but they endeavored to eon-
vert it into a prairie.
Why they did ail this nobody knows; it is
har,d to ascribe it to any reason, except a desire
to emp)oy the blacks and secure .Republican
votes. It is pitiable to look at the ruin thus
caused; stares peudered utterly inaccessible
and worthless fur all business purposes ; private
dwellings greatly reduced in value, and made
most uncomfortable, and all with no future,
no hope of improvement hereafter; the w}ip1b
a mere dead waste; and when it is considered
that the persons so damaged §ra not remuner;
ated, au4 have nq recourse or appeal, it
becomes a piece i^f heartlpss and blind cruelty.
It ia true the negroes obtained one half more
than tl}eir ordinary wages, and streamed into
the city by crowds to grow rich and .vols the
Republican ticket, but by this very act they
were led froij} their tfue occupations, were
brought where they must in the end puffer much
misery, while the neighboring country has
been left without the necessary labor to till
the "soil. ri:hQ$B poor ignorant people have

This was the suffrage, a lie, a cheat, a means
to squandering other people's money and
scQurmg double p>w for o'^s's self; a game, a
fraud,  methpd for ruining the white pan
and seizing his property.
It is only to be hoped tbftt roost of them did
not know enough to understand what they
were doing s and to show that this is probable,
