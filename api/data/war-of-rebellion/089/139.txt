HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, NINTH ARMY CORPS,October 8, 1864 - 11.15 a. m.

Major LYDIG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Army Corps:

The enemy have not developed any main line of battle as yet, but their skirmish line, which fell back before my advance, has returned part way and occupy a ridge intermediate between their old and new lines of works, re-enforced probably by their reserves. This ridge crosses the direct road between the Hawks house and the plank road. I have ordered a regiment as far up the road as is safe to reconnoiter. Colonel Harriman has not advanced his right in consequence of the troops on his right not moving. Contraband in Hawks' house says it is three miles from that house to the plank road, and that the enemy's works did not cross the plank road last Wednesday.

I am, very respectfully, &amp; c.,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Army Corps:

Your dispatch directing me not to bring on a general engagement is received, 11.35 o'clock. I do not think it judicious to extend any farther to the left. The colored troops had better be sent up. I am throwing up temporary works from redoubt 200 yards to left of the road. The main object of attracting the enemy's attention seems to be accomplished.

I am, very respectfully,

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

General WILLCOX:

General Potter reports 10.15 that his center is far ahead of his line, and that the left will have to move considerably before he can advance much farther, owing to the nature of things. If you can remain in your line and can make a drive on the enemy's skirmishers at some favorable point, do so.

Yours, respectfully,

JNumbers G. PARKE,

Major-General.

Major LYDIG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Ninth Army Corps:

The enemy's line has retired from the ridge since the movement of a regiment up the road. I do not think it necessary to bring out Ferrero's men at present. I have just heard from Harriman. There is a small
