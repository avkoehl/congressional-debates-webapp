Brigadier General FITZ HENRY WARREN, or COMMANDING OFFICER U. S. FORCES,

Near Fort De Russy:

GENERAL: The army arrived here last night; will be at Marksville about 12 to-day, and at Simsport Monday. The major-general commanding directs that you move with all the transports at Fort De Russy to Simsport, starting to-night, to meet the army at that place. He directed that you make this movement, unless you hear heavy firing in the direction of Marksville denoting an action, in which case you will move with your whole force, excepting guards for transports, to fall upon the enemy's flank, taking two days' rations and no baggage, and will send transports to Simsport.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE GULF,Near Marksville, May 15, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER U. S. FORCES,

Fort De Russy:

SIR: You will send to the army what wagons you have laden with forage, not to exceed fifty. It is essential that three wagons be sent immediately upon the receipt of this order. The forage steamer need not wait at Fort De Russy after these wagons are loaded and started. These wagons will continue with the army to Simsport. If you have no wagons, even a less number than fifty, the forage steamer will remain at Fort De Russy until wagons can be sent from here. The army encamps near Marksville to-night. The commanding general will be at Simsport to-morrow.

By order of Major-General Banks:

The major-general commanding directs you to move your whole command at 3 a. m. to-morrow to a position directly in rear of the town of Marksville, and hold yourself in readiness to move to support Generals Smith and Emory. The wagon train will be in park in your rear, guarded by a brigade of cavalry.

In moving across the prairies, and where practicable, for the purpose of shortening the column you will move your command in column of regiments.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. DRAKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
