Mr. BUCKLEY. To what extent does the
road run through the public lands?
Mr. WICHBSTER. I have stated already
thai the company only asks the right of way
through a distance of about eight miles from
the Alabama line to a place called Pollard,
on the line of the Montgomery and Mobile
road.
Mr. WALLS. I am surprised that the gen-
tleman from Alabama [Mr. Bfckxey] should
have made the motion he did. His State is
more interested in this road than the State of
Florida. The company is incorporated by the
Legislature of Alabama, and the right of way
asked for in the bill is in the State of Alabama,
or at least a large portion of it. The bill was
introduced into the Senate by Senator Os-
born at the request of citizens living along
the line of the road, and the right of way
asked for extends, as the gentleman from
Kentucky [Mr. Winchester] has stated, only
a length ot about eight miles. I hope the bill
will pass.
Mr. BUCKLEY. I made my motion to
draw out a statement of the facts. I now
withdraw it.
The rules were suspended, (two thirds hav-
ing voted in favor thereof,) and the bill was
passed.
DDKEJ5E AND i"JBCK.
The next business on the Speaker's table
was the bill (S. No. 1088) to authorize the
Secretary of the Interior to settle the claim of
Messrs. Durfee & Peck and E. H. Durfee for
supplies furnished the Indians in Montana in
the winter of 1869; which was read a first and
second time.
Mr. RANDALL. Is there any report
accompanying this bill?
Mr. KERR. I move the reference of the
bill to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
Mr. HOLMAN. I think it ought to go to
the Committee of Claims.
Mr. RANDALL. That is the proper refer-
ence.
Mr. KERR. I have no objection to that
reference. I modify my motion and move
that the bill be referred to the Committee of
Claims.
Mr. SHANKS. This bill hasbeen considered
in our committee by one of its members, the
gentleman from Missouri, [Mr. Burdett.] I
am not prepared to say at this time what
action ought to be taken upon the bill; and I
ask that it be referred to the Committee on
Indian Affairs.
Mr. KERR. Very well.
There being no objection, the bill was
referred to the Committee on Indian Affairs.
BRIDGE AT RED WING, MINNESOTA.
The next business on the Speaker's table
â– was the bill (S. No. 842) to authorize the con-
struction of a bridge across the Missouri river
at or near the city of Red Wing, in the State
of Minnesota, and to establish it as a post
road ; which was read a first and second time.
The bill was read at length.
Mr. DUNNELL. I ask that this bill be
There being no objection, the rules were
suspended, and the bill passed.
RIVER AND HARBOR BILL.
The SPEAKER. The next business on the
Speaker's table is the amendments of the Sen-
ate to the bill (H. R. No. 2208) making ap-
propriations for the repair, preservation, and
completion of certain public works on rivers
and harbors, and for other purposes. The
amendments of the Senate are mostly of
details except the closing amendment, which
the Chair will direct the Clerk to read.
The Clerk read as follows:
Insert the following:
That in the examinations or surveys of all points
mentioned in the foregoing section the Secretary of
War is directed to ascertain as far as pi acticabie the
amount of tonnage of commercial business during-
the previous year at each point, together with such
facts as bear upon the question of the contemplated
improvement, and that he communicate the same,
together with his report of the examination or sur-
vey of such point, to Congress.
Mr. HOLMAN. I hope that amendment
will be concurred in.
Mr. SAWYER. I move that the House non-
concur in all the amendments, and ask the
appointment of a committee of conference.
Mr. W. R. ROBERTS. Why non-concur in
all ? The amendment just read seems to be
right.
Mr. CONGER. There is an amendment
which restricts appropriations to the fiscal
year. In all our former bills the appropria-
tions have been general so that they might be
used during the proper season.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I think that is
the first clause of the bill.
Mr. CONGER. That is a very objection-
able amendment.
Mr. HOLMAN. I hope there will be no
objection to non-concurring in a number of
these amendments as to details, so that they
may go at once to a committee of conference.
Mr. BROOKS. Let them be read, so that
the House may know what they are. We have
time enough.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. There are
about forty amendments, some of them im-
portant.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will direct the
amendments to be read in their order.
The first amendment was read, as follows:
Amend the first paragraph of the bill by adding
" for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1873," so as to
read as follows:
That the following sums of money be, and are
hereby, appropriated, to be paid out of any money
in the Treasury not otherwise appropriated, to be
expended uuder the direction of the Secretary_ of
War, for the repair, preservation, and completion
of the following public works hereinafter named, for
the fiscal year ending June 30,1873.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. I wish to ex-
plain the difficulty with regard to this amend-
ment and a similar amendment in the fortifi-
cation bill. In both these bills hitherto the
appropriations for public works have not been
restrictad to the fiscal year, and therefore
would stand appropriated until they should
either be expended on the works or turned
back into the Treasury at the end of two years,
under a general provision of law. Now, if
this amendment should prevail, (and the re-
mark applies as well to the fortification bill as
to the river aDd harbor bill,) at midsummer,
on the 30th of June, all work must stop until
the Department can ascertain exactly the state
of the accounts, and until the new appropria-
tion for the next year comes in for use. For
several years regularly, and I believe without
any exception, these appropriations have been
made without restriction to the fiscal year,
and I am sure all will agree that this amend-
ment, if adopted, would be a very great inter-
ference with all our public works of a perma-
nent kind, such as fortifications and improve-
ments of rivers and harbors.
The amendment was non-concurred in.
The second and third amendments were to
reduce the appropriation for Chicago harbor
from $100,000 to $90,000, and to increase the
appropriation for Calumet harbor from $30,000
to $40,000.
Mr. SAWYER. I ask that all the Senate
amendments to this bill be non-concurred in
and a committee of conference asked.
Mr. BROOKS. I object to that mode of
doing business.
The SPEAKER. The reason the Chair is
having the amendment read for action is be-
cause the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Brooks] objected to the course suggested by
the gentleman from Wisconsin, [Mr. Sawyer,]
which required unanimous consent.
Mr. BROOKS. We passed a tariff bill day
before yesterday in that way, and we have
begun to repeat it to-day.
Mr. SAWYER. I move that both these
amendments be non-concurred in.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. These amend-
ments leave the two appropriations the same
in the aggregate, but change a portion of the
appropi'iatiou for Chicago haibor to Calumet
harbor.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. Chicago and Calu-
met are ten miles apart. What reason is there
for transferring a part of the appropriation for
Chicago to Calumet? Chicago is a harbor
for commerce, while Calumet is a harbor for
private speculation.
The amendments were non-concurred in.
The tenth amendment of the Senate fixed
the tonnage tax at the falls of the Ohio at five
cents per ton.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Without this
amendment there is no limitation on this ton-
nage tax. The amendment of the Senate fixes
it at five cents per ton.
Mr. CONGER. The tonnage tax is now
fifty cents per ton. This reduces it to five
cents per ton, which, in my judgment, is too
low for the preservation and repair of the
canal.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. All the engin-
eers concerned say this will be sufficient. I
move the amendment he concurred in.
Mr. STEVENSON. Mr. Speaker, the pro-
posed reduction of tolls levied on commerce
at the Louisville and Portland canal at the
falls of the Ohio river would be such a relief
to business that a word of explanation seems
justified. The present rate is fifty cents per
ton, an exorbitant tax, if any were right.
The imposition of duties upon trade and travel
on the navigable waters of the Union is incon-
sisteut with liberty and equality, an anomaly
in free government; yet it has prevailed on
the Ohio for over forty years, and more than
five million dollars have been drawn from
commerce and travel to pay for making and
maintaining the improvements which should
have been made and maintained by the
national Government for the benefit of the
whole people without charge beyond that
necessary to defray the cost of superintend-
ence.
