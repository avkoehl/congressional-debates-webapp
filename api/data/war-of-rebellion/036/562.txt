COLDWATER, VIA SENATOBIA, April 19, 1863-11 a. m.

Heavy skirmishing since 7 o'clock. Enemy have not yet succeeded in crossing Coldwater. His artillery commands the ferry. I am looking every moment for one piece of artillery. If it comes in time, I will hold this place. The enemy has advantage in position-bluff bank on north side, bottom on this side. Major [Robert A.] McCulloch, with skirmishers, has just charged the ferry, and driven back the artillery and cut the ferry-boat loose.

COLDWATER, VIA SENATOBIA, April 19, 1863.

The enemy is in retreat and we are pursuing. Our loss, 1 killed and 6 wounded. Enemy's loss not known further than 1 dead left at the ferry. The odds were very heavy, and my men behaved well, though many were for the first time under artillery fire.
