Colonel MINTY,

Commanding Cavalry Brigade:

SIR: The general commanding directs that you go to Chattanooga with all practical speed. You will report to the general commanding the army for orders. He is now at Widow Glenn's.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TWENTY-FIRST ARMY CORPS,East Slope Missionary Ridge, in rear Dept. Hdqrs.,

September 20, 1863-6 a.m.

Major-General PALMER:

The general commanding directs me to inform you that his First and Third Divisions are now encamped as above (in reserve). From your present position the general commanding the army deems it impracticable to withdraw you this morning, and you will therefore continue to act as yesterday-to aid and support General Thomas as he may direct. The general is very anxious to hear of and from you. He doubts not that, should you be called to-day again into a heavy fight, both you and your command will act with the energy, zeal, and courage you all displayed yesterday. There are supplies here for you (three days'); send some officer to look after them. What about your ammunition?

Respectfully,

P. P. OLDERSHAW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-Everything very quiet this morning. We must have punished the enemy badly yesterday. The men are all in good heart. Beatty took four guns.

P. P. O.

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Twenty-first Army Corps:

The general commanding directs you to turn out at once every available man of your command to clear away the timber in front of your lines and construct abatis. Axes have been borrowed for you from General Thomas, which you can send for at once, directing your quartermaster to receipt for them. They are to be returned as soon as the work is done.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. GODDARD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
