tion of anat on?l banking lnstituttcn Under ex-
isting dircumstances, the Senatoi j-, driven even
from ttiese comparatively nanow I mits He dis-
claims the idea of advocating, at present, the es-
tablishment of a nati >n->l bank Hence he Ins
never once throughout tne w hale course of his ar-
gument, called to hjs aid ihe power "to levy and
collect taxes ' He has not ev en mentioned Jt He
casts this power iiuo the back ground, whilst he
claims for Congress, from the other clauses of the
Constitution tihich Í hue read, the transcendant
power of creating a paper cuirencj witnout limits
Let us for a few moments examine his "rgumert
The fiameis oi the Oonstitu'ion were sturdy pa-

terred upon the GrPn ral Covernment ceitain enu-
merated pow ers Dieahig lesl this Government
might a tpinnt to usurp ot er powers «h ch had not
been granted, they have expressly declared that
" the powers not delegated t< the United States by
the Constitution, nor piohibued by it to the Stales,
are reset ved lo the States, respectively, or to the
people ' This camion was absolutely necessarj
to prevent astute and subtle law3 els fiom extending

These «ere not only the reasons foi adopting the
clause in the Constitution authorizing Congress to
regulate commerce, but they were the immediate
pause for assembling the convention which named
the Consmutir n itself This may be seen fiom the
pioceedings which led to the adoption of that in-
strument, contained in the first volume of (heLars
of the United States
The Slates were jealous m the extreme upon this
subject They weie reluctant to yield to Congress
the power of regulating commerce Some of them
proposed to surrender it for a teim of years, whilst
others refused to do any thing On the 13 h July,
1785, a committee oí Congress, of which Mr
Monroe was chairman, recommended an amend-
ment to the article  of confedeiation, containing,
ammg other dungs, a provision that the United
States, m Congress, should have the exclusive pow-
er "of regulating the hade of ihe Slates, as well with
Jmeign nations ns with each olhe¡, and of laying such
impost and duties upon impoits and exports as may
be ii'cessaryfoi the prnposr" This provisonwis
subject to seieral conditions and limitations which
I need not íepeat The 1 lectins at Annapolis, m
September 1786, was held foi simdai purposes,
but commissioners from five States onl> were pie-
sent, who declined to act upon the subject, and re-
commended the assemblmgo! the com cntion which
formed the piescnt Constitution of the United
States
Fiom 'his brief leview you may jud«.e, Mr Pre-
sident, what woull have been the astonishment of
those jealous patriots, iiho, with a ieluctant hand,
conferí ed ihis power upon Congress to regulate
commeice, if thev had been inforntd tnatit con-
tamed within tself the vast, the undefined and un-
dehnable power oí creating a papercuirercy w Ih-
out limit pnl without restnction In some cf the
¡state conventions which wcic assembled for the
purpose of ratify ng the federal Constitution, ex-
tierre mftrences were drawn, according to the spi-
rit of the time-, as to the powers which might be
assumed bj Congress from the langca< eof the in-
strument But no man m Amerca, however
haun'ed he might have been with the vildesf ap-
piehensions of Federal powei ever imagined that
there was lurking undei the simple power lo regu-
late commerce that of establishing a national paper
currency The Senatoi from Massachusetts has
first delected this slumbering power The woid
"íegulate," savs Crabbe, in his Svnonvmes, "is
applicable to things of minor moment where tne
f< ice of au'nontv is not so íequisite " It is infe-
ro" 111 poitney to the wouls "rile," "govern,"or
" duett " In Ihe h .nds of the Senator fiom Mas-
sachusetts, hovvt 'ei, it b"comes all-powerful H 
can conimp v th it, and 1 use up the phantom of
an all pelvadmgand unlimited papei currency
The Senatoi from Massachusetts has commented
upon ihe prepositions laid down bv the Piesidtnt
n his M>ssd!T( tint 'it wis lot designed b} the
C mslilut on tha 0 c Govt rniiitn should assume
the management of dome'fi andfo,'e!2neic1ian^'s,"
an 1 "thet as j^sth might it be called upon to pia-
ide foi the transpritatio 1 of the meichand se of
individuals" "Son , su, m ghl not the gent'einan
as fanlj deduce this prnvei fiom that of regu'ating
commerce, a the power of issain? paper money''
Nay, might it nit be don  more directly? The
fiist implicat on would natmally be, Congiess pos-
sesses the powr to regulate commerce, theietore,
you may mfei the po itrNof tiarsportmg merchan-
d sp withojt wheh commerce cannot exist But
commerce is the rxrhange of commodities, and
where they are not of equal ia!ue, some me-
oium is necissa'j to pa> the difference theiefoie
Oongipss po!>s->ss ihe power of creating a papei
cunencv f< r this purple Tne power to tiansport
meich"ndise is one step nearer to the fountain
1 ead than that of issuing paper It v ou adopt
such consultedms of the Constitutor, von ae
at sea wuhci t chait or compass, and lhat 1 -
-tiument mav be made tornean am. thing 01 no-
thing The plain and obvious intention of its
fiamers is sacpficed to the spirit of metaphysical
subtlety and to the desire of extending the powers
of the Federal Government
The Stnatoi asks is it possible lhat the Constitu-
tion ras given to Congress the nowei ovei com-
merce and yet has provided no current y bj wasc^i
it may be conduced? I answer t' 't (net¿™e </

And jet, si1-, from this cieai and p tcise powei

and of foreign com,' ticScnaior from Massachu-
setts also deduces the pow er or issaing paper mo-
ne}, and he ha seriously insiste 1 upon this aigu-
ment I confe j I if el mystflr t ( eilv at a ]o<> to
answer it lo conte id tn->t beiause Congress have
denved from the Constitution the express posver, and
that only r( cominggoldaad liver money ,ihatthere-
foie ltis then n_ht and the i dtitytocr-atepaperrao-

monstn us piop< sjtion It can not be mamtai >ed
for a moment The "laméis < Í the Constitution

language can n 1 a'e't it that out cunency shoull
be gold and silvei nlone and 'hey have prohibited
the Stiles trom m 1 1  any tiung else a legal
tender And yet the btnvtoi contends, that from
these veiy pi ovisions, apowti results to Congress of
creatm" a papti c r< j ttonf 1 ihecounliy The
frameis of the Const tution knew nothing of any
paper ci irtncy, cxctpi thai of the Revolution This
t lev would not touch ll i y Jilno lame ' Itw<.san

so little ski 1, that Ihev h ive authorized Congress
to create a j>aper cuirency for the whole Union,
which sh. ¡i sene as ine n diumif our domectic
and foicign <iehang<s' The Constitution, has
estab'ishcd gold and siLvei as t ie currency of the
country, and therefore t is contended  they have
authori7ed tin emission of a vast paper circulation'
Now I most s neeiilv be íeve, that if any such
constiuctions can pn \ nl then a'l the boundaries
of fedeial powei are at onccprostiated, and we are
