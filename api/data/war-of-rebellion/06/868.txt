HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, March 31, 1862.

General SAMUEL JONES,

Commanding at Pensacola:

GENERAL: In answer to certain inquiries made in behalf of Colonel Thomas M. Jones, as the commanding officer at Pensacola, by Captain John B. Sale, I have the honor to state that you are desired to hold Pensacola, the navy-yard, &amp;c., provided you have the ability to do so, and to save all the public property of value. Should you be opposed by an irresistible force, you are expected to bring off your command in good order, with their arms, &c. It is therefore suggested that you at once make arrangements for sending to places of security all property not necessary for your purpose, to mobilize your troops, and be prepared for any emergency.

All the arms that are available have been sent to the governor of Florida. Nine hundred will be sent to you by him. Possibly he may supply you with more. The commanding officer at Tallahassee has been written to send you a company of cavalry and a company of light artillery, if he can procure them. As regards the field officers of the Twenty-seventh Mississippi Regiment, I learn from the Adjutant and Inspector General's Office that Thomas M. Jones has been appointed colonel, James L. Autrey lieutenant-colonel, and George H. Lipscomb major.

Very respectfully,

R. E. LEE,

General.
