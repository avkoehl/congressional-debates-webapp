cannot neglect to recognize the active and cordial co-operation of the commands of Colonels Rives and Hughes, Majors Winston and Thornton, Captain Mitchell, Grooms, and Spratt, and Adjutant Flowerree, of General Steen's division, Major Peacher, of General Clark's division, and Major Welton, and the officers and men of General McBride's division.

At 5 o'clock p. m. on the 19th instant a truce was granted by you to the enemy to enable them to remove their sick and wounded from the hospital which had been captured by us the day previous. This afforded me the opportunity to make final and complete arrangements for defense of he hospital position during the day, notwithstanding the active skirmishing along the entire line. Lieutenant-Colonels Hull and Brace had been enabled materially to improve and extend their defenses, composed of earthwork and timber. During the day and entire night of the 19th I was almost continually in the saddle, visiting the various positions, and giving detailed instructions to all grades. The extreme exhaustion and fatigues which I suffered taught me to appreciate fully the heroic patriotism and endurance of those brave men who had been exposed with me for forty-eight hours continuously, without comparatively eighter food, water, or bankers, and encountering the severest physical trials.

At 8 o'clock a. m. on the 20th instant I ordered up additional hemp to extend the defenses at the position occupied by Colonel Green and Lieutenant-Colonels Hull and Brace. The activity and zeal of these commands in putting the bales in position reflect the greatest honor upon them. I directed them to be used as portable breastworks, to be pushed forward towards the enemy's line sin parallel approaches. The disclosure of the hemp defenses or approaches, as they might be called, elicited the obstinate resentment of the enemy, who was profuse in the bestowal of round and grape shot, and was not at all economical of his minie balls; but our men, gallantly led by their officers, continued to approach the enemy, pouring in upon him a most destructive fire until about 2 o'clock p. m., when he surrendered.

The loss sustained by my division in the entire engagement was: Killed, 11; severely wounded, 18; slightly wounded, 26; making a total of casualties, 55.* I regret to state that among the killed were Lieutenant John W. Mason, of Saint Charles County, an officer of Lieutenant-Colonel Hull's battalion, and Sergt. Major W. A. Chappell, of Colonel MacDonald's regiment, both of which officers fell while gallantly leading and encouraging their men. Among so many officers and men who are entitled to honorable mention for gallant and distinguished services to make mention of a few appears like discrimination, yet I cannot refrain from mentioning the names of Colonel Green and Lieutenant-Colonel Briace and Lieutenant-Colonels Hull and Porter. Both of the latter-named gentlemen were wounded severely in the head by shot from the enemy. Lieutenant-Colonel Gremshaw severely sprained his ankle while gallantly rallying his men. Major Milton, of the Callaway Rangers, aided gallantly in the recapture of the hospital. Captain Robinson, of the Callaway infantry, deserves honorable mention for his zeal and cool, deliberate courage. Colonel MacDonald faithfully and in a soldierly manager gallantly repelled several severe assaults from the enemy. Colonel Franklin, of Shuyler County, Captain McCulloch, Captain Davis, Captain Richardson (severely wounded), Captain Grant, and Adjt. William F. Davis, all of Colonel Green's regiment, are entitled to honorable
