HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,April 23, 1864. (Received 1 p.m.)

Captain McENTEE,

Harper's Ferry:

It is generally believed in Lee's army that Longstreet's corps is near Charlottesville. I cannot find that his troops have been seen yet. I cannot find date of bread riot at Bristol by Wofford's Georgia brigade. Longstreet and Bishop [Polk?] commanded at Orange Court-House last Monday. Jeff. Davis there on Friday. Previous concentration of cavalry at Hamilton's Crossing. Officers in Lee's army talk of the necessity of an advance, in order to throw Meade back, and afterward fight Burnside. The Twenty-sixth Mississippi, late on duty at Danville, and the Third [First] Confederate Battalion Regulars, Forney commanding, have been added to Joe Davis' Mississippi brigade. The latter is from Loring's division, Johnston's Army. Lee's army constantly provided with nine days' forage and seven days' rations. Baggage gone to the rear. All your dispatches received. They give satisfaction. Use telegraph when necessary.

GEO. H. SHARPE,

Colonel, Assistant Provost-Marshal-General.
