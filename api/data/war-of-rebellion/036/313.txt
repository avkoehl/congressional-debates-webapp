JACKSON, April 18, 1863.

General CHALMERS, Panola, MISS.:

I regard the navigation at the Mississippi River shut out from us now. No more supplies can be gotten from the Trans-Mississippi Department. Can you not supply 15,000 men from Panola?

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

JACKSON, April 18, 1863.

Major HOWELL HINDS, Fayette, MISS.:

We have a cargo of bacon on a boat in Choctaw Bayou, 4 miles WEST of Water Proof. It is of vital importance to save it. Can it be transported to the river, and crossed at Rodney, and from thence sent to the railroad? If so, you will undertake the direction of the enterprise. If you can get it across anywhere you will do a great service, for which Lieutenant-General Pemberton will be most grateful. Answer.

W. H. McCARDLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

JACKSON, April 18, 1863.

Brigadier General John S. BOWEN, Grand Gulf:

Steamer Vigo is now in Choctaw Bayou, 4 miles WEST of Water Proof, with a cargo of bacon for Vicksburg. Send an energetic commissary and quartermaster to receipt for the bacon and provide transportation, by impressment if necessary. What means would you suggest for getting it across the river? It is too necessary for it to be lost. Answer as soon as possible.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF Mississippi AND EASTERN LOUISIANA,Jackson, April 20, 1863.

Major THEO. Johnston, Chief of Subsistence:

MAJOR: I am directed by the lieutenant-general commanding to say, in reply to your communication of to day's date, relative to subsistence at Port Hudson, La., that he is satisfied with amount now on hand, but hereafter the supply must not be decreased, as it will have to be kept up by land. Every effort must be made to supply as fast as consumed.

I am, major, your obedient servant,

J. H. MORRISON,

Aide-de-Camp.

Colonel W. S. LOVELL, Natchez:

Am arranging to haul the one thousand sacks corn to Port Hudson. You must get all you can for that place. Is it quartermaster or commissary?
