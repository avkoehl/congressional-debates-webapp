friends, so far as its revenue capacity is concerned.
I tell you in what it is that their expectations have
been disappointed. The expenditures of the Gov-
ernment have not been reduced to the extent that
they expected. The public lands have been, in
fact, abandoned as a source of revenue. It has
been proclaimed by the party coming into power
that they intended to give them away m the shape
of a homestead; and as the Secretary of the Inte-
rior has well said, this has operated constantly as a
preventive and a bar to the purchase of these lands
by persons who otherwise would have bought
them, if they had not hoped to receive them as a
gift. This, and the fact that the bounty land bill,
which was passed for the soldiers of 1812, had not
exhausted its operation, has hitherto kept down
the receipts from the public lands.
But, Mr. President, if it were to be understood
that the funds arising from these lands were to be
honestly and faithfully devoted to the payment of
the public debt; if it was to be understood that
this homestead measure was not to be passed in
times like these, now that this bounty-land act
hasalmost exhausted itself, there being only about
8,000,000 of acres to be taken under it, we miyht
soon hope to have a revenue of $5,P00,000^or
$6,000,000 from that source; and this added to the
capacity of this tariff of 1857—1 mean in a good
time; I mean if credit were restored; if there were
no revolution and disunion abroad; because in re-
gard to that exceptional state of things I can pre-
dict nothing—I say if the times were good, there
would be full reason to believe, if we were to
apply the proceeds of the public lands honestly to
the payment of the public debt, that we should
derive enough from imports, together with the
proceeds of those public lands, to carry on this
Government, and to begin to pay the public debt.
I say so because, according to the statement of
the Secretary of the Treasury for the last fiscal
year, the expenditures were between $59,000,000
and §60,000,000, including a debt of $4,500,000,
paid as Post Office deficiency, arid excluding the
interest on the public debt. According to this
statement, the expenditure, including this Post
Office deficiency, and including the interest on the
public debt, would have been somewhere about
163,000,000. If, however, wc excluded, as we
ought to do—if we were to make the Post Office
Department sustain itself—these <£4,500,000, it
would reduce the annual expenditure to something
like $58,000,000, and that not upon estimate or
conjecture, but the actual experience of the last
fiscal year. I say but for these times, there was
every probability that this taiifF of 1857 would
have yielded $58,000,000. Add to that the
$3,100,000, which I believe the Secretary of the
Interior says the lands yielded last year, for his
statement is a little in excess of that of the Sec-
retary of the Treasury; and add the receipts from
miscellaneous sources, about $11^000,000, and wc
should have had, with the receipts from the pub-
he lands, and from miscellaneous sources, upon
that estimate, enough to carry on the Govern-
ment and to pay a small deficiency for the Post
Office Department. Ifwchad received §60,000,000,
as he estimated, we should have received quite
enough to carry on the expenditures of the last
year, which included §4,400,000 of deficiency for
the Post Office Department, and to pay the annual
expenditures, and the interest of the public debt
also.
Wow, sir, do we not know, from the experience
of the past, that our ad valorem tarifis have gen-
erally increased in revetrue faster than the ex-
penditures and population of the country? Have
we not seen that the leven'ue from the existing
tariff was increasing rapidly up to the period of
political disturbance? Was there not every rea-
son,therefore, to suppose that it would soon yield,
if it did not this year, the #69,000,000 estimated
by the Secretary of the Treasury? if we were
to add such proceeds from the public lands as
wc should have a light to expect in ease we dul
not pass a homestead bill, when the bounty land
bill shall be exhausted, we should probably have
1^5,000,000 or ^6,000,000 nioie. And, sir, why
should we not devote the proceeds of the public
lands to the payment of the public debt? It was
the great resource in the war of the Revolution, and
has been in all the wars we have had since. We
have given bounties to our soldiers from these
lands. Wo have used the proceeds to pay the
debts which have been incurred. Why should
we now, in this time of our financial trouble,
abandon this source of revenue? Why should we
not apply it to the payment of the debts? At the
opening of this session, I proposed that we should
pledge the proceeds of these lands specifically, to
redeem the Treasury notes then to be issued; not
generally, but to set them aside as a fund to enable
anybody who had a note, as long asthe money
was there,to exchange it, dollarfordoiJar.;amitbat,
in addition to the fact that they were receivable for
public dues, would probably have enabled us to
keep out $10,000,000, not at an interest of from
10 to 12 per cent., but an interest of from 6 to'8
per cent. But, sir, it was against tlio creed of the
Chicago platform, and upon that account all at-
tempts of this sort have been rejected'; and we
have seen the consequences that have-been en-
tailed upon us.
But, Mr. President, this was not the only re-
spect in which the expectations of those who voted
for the tariff of 1857 were disappointed in regard
to public expenditures. We did not suppose that
the Post Office Department was to be saddled as
a constant and permanent source of expenditure
for millions annually upon the Treasury; and yet
such has been the case; and when a Democratic
President recommended an increase of the rates
of postage, to make it self-sustaining, and when
a Democratic Postmaster General recommended
the same increase, and when we sought here to
pass it into a law, and also to cut off, at the same
time, the expenditures arising outof the franking
privilege, that bill was lost in the House of Rep-
resentatives; and we have been met by a persist-
ent opposition whenever we have attempted to
make the Department sustain itself. What has
been the consequence ? What do you suppose,
Mr. President, has been the expenditure out of
the Treasury for the Post Office Department for
the past three years? 1 venture to assert that, if
any Senator was called on to state it, he could not
come within the amount by millions. Here is a
statement showing the payments from theTreas-
ury for the support of the Post Office Department,
exclusive of the receipts fiom postage, from March
4, 1857, to January 31, 1861; and they amountto
$25,585,000—paid by the incomefrom imposts out
of the Treasury of the United States since the 4th
of March, 1857. And what would you suppose,
Mr. President, was the amount previously paid
since lhc ediiction of the rates of postagem 1851?
Twenty-two million one hundred and forty-nine
thousand dollars; so that thus we have incurred
a debt of nearly $50,000,000, which we have paid
out of the imposts foi the support of the Post
Office Department.*
