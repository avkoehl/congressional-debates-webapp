Mr. DAWES. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Appropriations to report back the
bill (H. 11. No. 303G) making appropriations
for the repair, preservation, and completion
of certain public works on rivers and harbors,
and for other purposes, and to recommend
its passage, with certain amendments. These
amendments are only such as were uninten-

merce, and they have the assent of that com-
mittee. I move that the bill be referred to
the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, and be made a special order for next
Monday immediately after the morning hour,
and from day to day until disposed of.

Mr. FOX. I call for the reading of the bill.

District of Columbia, reported back with an
amendment in the form of a substitute the bill
(tl. Li. No. 2959) to regulate the grade of
Maryland avenue from the end of the Long
Bridge to Twelfth street.
The substitute reported by the committee
was read. It proposes to authorize the Bal-
timore and Potomac Railroad Company to
change, at the expense of the company, the
grade of Maryland avenue so as to establish a
descending grade of l/jfs feet per hundred feet
from the center of Twelfth street south to the
center of Thirteen-and a-half street south; and
a descending grade of l/0\- feet per hundred
feet from the center of Thirteen-and-a-half
street south to the top of the abutment of the
Long Bridge over the Potomac river, as newly
constructed; the present grade at the center
of Twelfth street south to be reduced two feet,
and the level of the top of the new abutment
of the Long Bridge not to be more than nine
feet above the height of the old abutment. If
any actual damage is sustained by the owners
of any property on Maryland avenue or the
streets connecting therewith by reason of the
change of grade, the railroad company is to
pay such damages, which may be recovered in
any court of competent jurisdiction in the
District of Columbia. The change of grade
is to be made under the supervision of tho
proper municipal authorities of the city of
Washington or of the District of Columbia, and
in a manner to be approved by those author-
ities.
The substitute reported by the committee
was agreed to.

Mr. KERR. Mr. SDeaker, this bill is a
startling proposition. Since my service here,
I have been subjected to many surprises of
this kind. I have many times thought tho
outermost boundary of reckless and Utopian
schemes of legislation had been reached.
During the last ten years I have studied with
deep and often painful interest the progress
of our great revolution. Beginning as u con-
flict of ideas and of arms, many gross and
dangerous excesses were justified or tolerated
on the ground of assumed military necessity.
On the overthrow of the South, and the restor-
ation of ostensible peace, the revolution was
continued in this Capitol by the leaders of the
Republican party. It still goes on. Its power
may be waning, but its vicious spirit, is not
reformed nor its wicked purposes abandoned.
It has not learned to submit to the just re-
straint of law or to respect the Constitution.
With insatiate love of power, it stops at no
usurpation if it only promise partisan success.
Although "the savtige spirit of wild war''
has ceased to control the people, and it is no
longer necessary, if ever it were, 'â€¢ to heal the
inveterate canker of one wound by maTsing
