THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
2885
writes to ft member of the Committee on For-
eign Affairs, and to other gentlemen, stating
that the price was twenty-fiveper cent, above
the market, and sending certificates of dealers
to that effect. For further information in regard
to this subject I refer to Executive Docnment
NMr.8Neal, our consul, in speaking of this
fellow, Abecassis, in a letter to Secretary iiobe-
son, dated September 13, 1869, says:
"For reasons of which I am ignorant our naval
officers do not think it necessary to consult the Uni-
ted States authorities at this port in the matter of
purchasing supplies, having repairs made, &c., but
rely entirely upon this Mr. Abecassis, who styles
himself "the naval oontractor of the United States.
By what authority he assumes this title I am not
informed. He is not a merchant is not a butoher,
baker nor even ship-chandler. Ilo has no supplies,
and his entire business, as far as I can see, is lim-
ited to his dealings with our fleet and Government.
In the letters from the bureaus through which
the oil was purchased it is stated in justification
that the price paid, $1 05 per gallon, was less
than the last purchase made at Ville Franche,
in France, where $1 30 was paid per gallon.
If this proves anything it is not that the Gov-
ernment was not swindled at Lisbon, but that
it was worse swindled at Ville Franche. Prob-
ably there is another and a worse Abecassis
at Ville Franche than at Lisbon, which renders
it pretty certain than these abuses exist every-
where, and that some legislation of the kind I
propose is necessary to prevent it.
In justice to the Navy I should perhaps say
further, that the chief engineer in his letter says
that at the time this oil was purchased in Lisbon
olive oil was worth in Boston $1 40 to $1 45
per gallon currency. Butaissuch oil had paid a
duty of thirty cents a gallon, gold, it is per-
fectly evident that the Boston oil dealer must
have bought his oil abroad for eighty cents or
less in gold, to be able to pay thirty cents gold
duty per gallon and sell it here for the price
named. But if it were not true that the Gov-
ernment had paid a penny more than a fair
price, the necessity of taking away a.discretion
whereby the Government may be swindled is
apparent.
When the present Administration came into
power the condition of the Navy was most
deplorable. Mr. Welles, in a letter to Senator
Grimes, chairman of the Committee on Naval
Affairs in the Senate, bewailed the condition
of the Navy and naval vessels, and attributed
it all to the neglect of Congress in not giving
him his estimated appropriations, and says
that "if those who succeed me are embarrassed
for the want of vessels or means, it shall be no
fault of mine." Yet it shonld be borne in
mind that the means at his disposal were in
excess of those of the present Secretary. The
gentleman from New York [Mr. Cox] some
time since made a speech in which he arraigned
the Navy Department, and made the statement
that there had been expended on the Navy in
the last year $87,782,716 95. That he may
have no farther excuse for misrepresentation
I will furnish him and the House with offi-
cial figures showing the exact expenditures for
the past year and the preceding year j figures
that, in view of the amount of work done on
our ships, are greatly to the credit of the pres-
ent management as contrasted with the late
Administration.
It will be seen that the amount expended
from March, 1868, to March, 1869, was $22,-
760,359 90; from March, 1869, to March, 1870,
$20,893,159 24; and I am assured that the
expenses for the present fiscal year will not
exceed $20,000,000. Before the debate is closed
on this bill I propose to say something in re-
gard to the cost of maintaining the Navy under
the present and late Administrations, and I
will say here that the comparison toll be highly
favorable to the present Administration.
The present head of the Department, I am
sure, is disposed to correct abuses and dis-
countenance extravagance and inefficiency.
How far he is hampered by influences that dis-
regard law, and/regard the Navy as the prop-
erty of a ftivored few, to be used for the glori-
fication ofthemselves, friends, and flatterers, is
not for me to say; but I can assure him that
neither the Navy generally nor thfe public are
satisfied that an irresponsible party should
stand between him and the bureaus of the De-
partment, the officers of the Navy and people
of the United States.

Expenses from July, 1868, to March, 1869.—
The expenses for these months are $1,000,000
less than for the current year, but this is done
by the refunding of their last month, Febru-
ary, and leaving us to settle in March. Their
whole year from March to March will be seen
to exceed ours from March to March of the
current year by $2,000,000.

Mr. COVODE. In addition to what the
gentleman from Wisconsin [Mr. Washburn]
has said, I desire to say that the fellow, Abe-
cassis, to whom lie has referred, was recog-
nized as a gentleman here, while he was not
recognized as such in Spain.
Mr. LOGAN. Who recognized him as a
gentleman here?
Mr. COVODE. The officials of the Navy
Department. He was in the habit of spend-
ing a part of his time here, and succeeded in
securing the confidence of the ex-Secretary
of the Navy; and then when he went abroad
he ignored entirely the American minister at
Lisbon and made contracts, one of which was
to sell coal collected at Lisbon for the rebel
navy to American steamers at a profit of $1 23
per ton, and ft very inferior article at that, as
compared with English coal for sale in the
same market.
Mr. ALLISON. Was it Pennsylvania coal ?
[Laughter.]
Mr. COVODE. No, it was not Pennsyl-
vania coal. Mr. Harvey, our minister at Lis-
bon, did his duty faithfully in reporting to the
Government of the United States the trans-
actions then going on at Lisbon, in which there
was a speculation amounting to a very large
sum of money for the benefit of this fellow
Abecassis, a Jew and the keeper of a doggery
in Lisbon. Sir, it sickened me of the whole
transactions of the Navy Department when I
saw that the money of the United States was
being squandered abroad for the benefit of a few
individuals, and those not deserving the con-
fidence of the Government. Mr. Harvey did his
duty faithfully, and reported the facts. The
statement was sent to me, and I went to the
Navy Department with it, but could not even get
a hearing there, although I was prepared to show
that thousands of dollars wefe being squandered
for the benefit of a man who had no reputa-
tion at Lisbon or elsewhere, except in the
Navy Department here. This, of course, was
done under the Johnsoh administration
Mr. HALE then addressed the Committee
of the Whole, but before concluding his re-
marks,
The hour of half past four o'clock p. m.
having arrived, the Committee of the Wholfe
on the state of the Union, pursuant to order
of the House, took a recess until half past
seven o'clock.

EVENING SESSION.
At half past seven o'clock p. m. the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union
resumed its session, (Mr, Eldridge in the
chair,) arid proceeded with the consideration
of the bill (H. R. No. 1533) making appro-
priations for the naval service for the fiscal
year ending 80th June, 1871.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Maine [Mr. Hale] is entitled to the floor, and
has twenty-five minutes of his hour remaining.
Mr. KELLEY. The gentleman from Maine
is not here yet.
Mr. HOLMAN. Mr. Chairman, inasmuch
as the gentleman from Maine is not present,
and it is almost certain that there will be but
few members here this evening, as the pres-
ence of the Ohio Legislature in the city has
drawn off many members of the House to
extend to them the usual courtesies of the!
capital, I would suggest that the committee
rise, and that the House adjourn; and I make
the motion that the committee rise.
Mr. KELLEY. The gentleman from Maine
[Mr. Hale] is novf present.
Mr. HOLMAN. If. the gentleman from
Maine desires to go on this evening, of Course
I will not insist on my motion.
Mr. HALE. I have no objection whatever
to the rising of the committee.
Mr. KELLEY. I think we had perhaps
better take a recess for ten minutes, to see if
members will come in. .
Mr. MORGAN. Is the motion to rise debat-
able?
