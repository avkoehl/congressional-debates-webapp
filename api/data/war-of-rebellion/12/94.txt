
cide where I can be of most use. If your determination is unchanged I ought to go to Alexandria at once. Please define my position and duties.

To which I received the following reply:

You ask me for information which I cannot give. I do not know either where General Pope is or where the enemy in force is. These are matters which I have all day been most anxious to ascertain.

On the 26th I received the following:

WASHINGTON, August 26, 1862-11 a.m.

There is reason to believe that the enemy is moving a large force into the Shenandoah Valley. Reconnaissances will soon determine. General Heintzelman's corps was ordered to report to General Pope, and Kearny will probably be sent to-day against the enemy's flank. Don't draw any troops down the Rappahannock at present; we shall probably want them all in the direction of the Shenandoah. Perhaps you had better leave General Burnside in charge at Aquia Creek and come to Alexandria, as very great irregularities are reported there. General Franklin's corps will march as soon as it receives transportation.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

Major General GEORGE B. McCLELLAN.

On receipt of this I immediately sailed for Alexandria, and reported as follows:

ALEXANDRIA, August 27, 1862- 8 a.m.

I arrived here last night, and have taken measures to ascertain the state of affairs here, and that proper remedies may be applied. Just received a rumor that railway bridge over Bull Run was burned last night.

ALEXANDRIA, August 27, 1862-9.40 a.m.

The town is quiet, although quite full of soldiers, who are said to be chiefly convalescents. The affairs of the quartermaster's department are reported as going on well. It is said that the Bull Run Bridge will be repaired to-morrow. The disembarkation of Sumner's corps commenced at Aquia yesterday afternoon. I found that he could reach Rappahannock Station earlier that way that from here.

On the same day I received the following:

WASHINGTON, August 27, 1862.

Telegrams from General Porter to General Burnside, just received, say that Banks is at Fayetteville; McDowell, Sigel, and Ricketts near Warrenton; Reno on his right. Porter is marching on Warrenton Junction to re-enforce Pope. Nothing said of Heintzelman. Porter reports a general battle imminent. Franklin's corps should move out by forced marches, carrying three or four days' provisions, and to be supplied as far as possible by railroad. Perhaps you may prefer some other road than to Centreville. Colonel Haupt has just telegraphed about sending out troops. Please see him, and give him your directions. There has been some serious neglect to guard the railroad, which should be immediately remedied.
