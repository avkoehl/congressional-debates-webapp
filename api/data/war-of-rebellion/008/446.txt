I deem it my duty, however, to say to you, general, in all frankness and kindness, that remarks made by you, both at Sedalia and in this city (if I am correctly informed), about our defenseless condition and the probility that the enemy would take this city, have led to unfair and harsh comments by those who did not know.

Yours, truly,

H. W. HALLECK.
