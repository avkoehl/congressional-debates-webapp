prudent in some of the sentiments it advanced,
yet that, being advanced, we were bound to sup-
port them'
Mr. ADAMS said, "No."
Mr. EVANS sijid he begged the gentleman's
pardon He knew he did not use that language
But such was the general inference It was hardly
necessary for us at once to say that all hopes of
a pacific course were at an end He wished, in
common with others, to hear from France—to
learn the effect which the message had upon her
people and their representatives. He wished to
hope for the best, until all plausibility of hope
was gone. He had but a single word to add. He
could not consent to sanction any incipient meas-
ure of hostility on the part of this Government,
until the whole facta and correspondence was laid
before them. It was a point in our political rela-
tions where we must use great consideration and
forbearance The term " jugglmg"had been used
in relation to he Fiench Ministry He had
thought the good faith of the King of the French
had never been doubted, and he could not sanc-
tion any measure of incipient act of hostility, until
every pacific measure in our power had been tried.
It was with these views, and a desire to receive
a corresponding report from the Committee of
Foreign Relations, that he should vote in favor
of the motion of the gentleman from Massachu-
setts
Mr CAMBRELENG said that the gentleman
from Maine seemed to be apprehensive that the
President's message would produce injurious
effects upan our lelations with France, and yet
the gen letnan's argument had convinced him that
if the appropria ion was not niai'e by the Fiench
Chamber, ueoald not be ascribed to the tone of the
Piesident's message. The gentleman despaired—
he had lost all h pe—'he correspondence winch
he had just heard read, had, for the first time,
induced him to believe that serious consequences
might result, and yet, when this mteltigence.vvhich
had extmgu shed hope, ¡eft France, the message
had not arrived. He did not rise, however, to
excite debate, or to produce division, but to con-
gratulate the country that but one sentiment was
heard from ail sides of the House—'hat however
gentlemen night differ as to the time foi action,
wnenever the ime aruved they would presentan
undivided front He responded entire1 y to the
patrioti" sent i íents «o admirably expressed by
the gen lemanfiom Massachusetts, [Mr Ad\ms ]
He thought wuh him that a more prompt and
decid-d course would have been prefeiable. Had
the two House , at the commeiicmentof the ses-
sion a<"<umed a bolder attitude, he thought it would
have been more consistent wi'h national patriot-
ism, national honor, and sound national policy
Uiifoiitii a ely, anothet course was puisued, and
a measure adopted which he found would not pro-
duce the result antiup ited A mOie decided policy
would have shown to Prance and to the world,
that we wtie le-vdved to assert our rights, and
that after five end twenty years of wrong and in-
sult, we could no longei consider forbearance a
national virtue But while heioncurred with the
gende nan fioni Massachusetts, in desiring to vin-
dicate our (huacter and our ligh's, and while he
wo 'J have gone witn him at an earlier, oi at any
perol of the session, t< r lie measure íecori-
menJed by the Pi evident, or for any other tnat
the gentleman himself might have proposed wh'ch
would have nccomp'ished the object, hediffeied
with him us to the J ,o rriety of precipitating our
action at the ex->ei s? of oui unanimity It is
necessary to seruie unanimity not onlv lieie, but
in the other brand  of the Lczitlntuie, and that
cannot be e\pe. led w bile the attitude o! the ques-
tion i «mains imil.anged It is for tint itasnn,
and that alone, that hedesned th it the House
might not now be called upon to act definitively
upon tne question He felt as sensitive as the
gentleman iron* Massachusetts, at eteiy hours ,
14
delay; he felt that they were every moment ap-
proaching the period m the history of these rela-
tions with France, when forbearance would become
pusillanimity. But to give effect to measures,
whatever they might be, union was necessary,
and however prepared the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts and himself mignt be for definitive or
preparatory action, others in this House, inde-
pendent of the other body, would prefer postpon-
ing the decision of the question to a later period
of the session. The gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia [Mr, Stewart] had suggested postponement
to tre 20th, or some such date, but though he
should not object to that, he should prefer that the
House would leave the question of time to the
discretion of the committee. He trusted we should
not be precipitated into any half-way measures,
and that whatever might be proposed would meet
the approbation of the House. If the gentleman
from Massachusetts would not modify or with-
draw his proposition to instruct, he hoped that
part of the motion would not prevail.
Mr PATTON (his remarks were frequently
inaudible at the reporters desk) was under-
stood to say he had not, in the slightest degree,,
changed his opinion with regard to the propriety
of a prompt and immediate report from the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, upon the matter under
consideration; but entertained the opinion, with
unabated conviction, that it was their duty to the
House, to the country, and eminently so to the
President of the United States, whose opinions
and recommendations upon this great subject had
been comm'tted to them for dehoera ion, that the
committee, which constituted a merely incipient
organ of the House for digesting materials for its
action, should not delay one moment, efter their
ov n opinion and judgment had been formed upon
the materials committed to them, m reporting their
lesolutions and deliberations for the concurrence
or for the disapprobation of the House. Enter-
taining that view, and entertaining, moreover, the
belief, a belief deeply impressed upon his mind by
the information communicated that morning, the
material parts of which weie before within the
knowledge of the Committee on Foreign Affairs,
that it was utterly hopeless to expect any decisive
information from Fiance, as to the action which
would take place m the French Chamber of Dep-
uties upon the bill malting appropriations for car-
rying the treaty into effect, until arter, or until
very near the close of, the present session of Con-
gress, he did then conceive, and he now conceived,
that this subject ought to have been before the
House for its deliberation upon the principles
involved in the President's message, as well as
upon the expediency and propue'y of the partic-
ular measure of redress he proposed, and the expe-
diency oi prop'iety, at that time, of resorting to
any measure of rediess whatever. However his
own opinions might diffet from those of any other,
oi all the members of the Committee on Foreign
Relations, upon that subject, it was, he humbly
conceived, a matter tha' be'onged net to the com-
mittee to decide, or to conclude It was not, he
conceived, for tnem to forestall, but it belonged
pecunaily to that House, unaffected and uninflu-
enced by the action of any other branch of the
Legislature of the Government. It belongeJ to

ficts stand  M Livingston  despatch of tie
"■21 of November showed that, aieoidmg 'o the
information obtained by lnu m Pars, the bill
which the Fiench King (Mr P hfd no sort o'"
doubt with the utmost emcer-ty, for he d.J not
take the King's declaration in the literal se ise of
the terms m which it was couched,) had declared
his determination to present to the Chamber of
Deputies, as soon as it could be reasonably and
judiciously presented, would not be presented to
the Chamber for its consideration until the middle
of January All the information we have subse-
quently received, either from Mr. Livingston or
from any private sources, went to satisfy us that
this impression was correct,and that in all human
probability, instead of being presented earlier, it
would rot be until a later period
Thiswas a question (said Mr P.) which,know-
ing as we did the feelings and opinions, and the
conflict of opinion existing in France, and in the
Chamber of Deputies, on this subject, would not
be, could not be promptly and immediately dis-
posed of.  And every one knew that if the subject
was not presented to the Chamber before the mid-
dle of January, it could not possibly receive the
definite action of that body early enough for us to
obtain any mfoimation of their definite aclron
until the close, or near the close, of the present
session of Congress.   Mr. P. could not, there-
foie, perceive the propriety for further delay, nor
did  he the other day, when he offered to that
J! House, and asked permission to present for its
,  adoption certain resolutions containing the pnnci-
I  pies and opinions upon which he was prepared to
r show to the House that it was time the subject
should come under its deliberation    More than
two thuds of the session had elapsed, and only
'  three weeks of it remaining, and there was just
tune enough that this subject, which was calcu-
lated to pioduce much conflict of opinion, and a
great variety of propositions, as to what ought to
be the co'irse adopten, should be brought before
this body, whose deliberations we all knew, could
rot be promptly brought to a conclusion,  they
should have it in their power fully to deliberate
I  upon thepnriciplesitinvolied.and assoonasthey
had come to an opinion, to express it m the form
of resolutions or m the form of action    If there
, were any who upon deliberation should be of
opinion that at that time it was prudent, proper,
¡' and necessary to have action, it might be taken.
I     It was due (said Mr P ) to himself, and he felt
1 it certainly due to the honorable and distinguished
gentleman  fiom  Massachusetts, that he should
i   say that he felt much satisfact'on at the spirit of
hisremsiks     He understood those remaiks pre-
I ciselvas that gentleman has since explained them,
viz  Foi not committing himself to the propriety
I  of any particular measure at that time, but it was
j  his opinion that this House owed it not only to
,  the executive heed of the country, whose consti-
tu'ional duty had made it necessary to present
this subject and his opinions to their consider-
ation, but also to the anxious feeling of the coun-
tiy,and to the great interests involved  in this
hgi>, unportent, „nd cr.Ucal question, that they
'   shou'd say whether they concurred in the views
of the President, that this treaty was a velid and
binding treaty,  whether they concuired  in  the
, opinion  expressed  by the President, that this
country would not, and could rot, acquiesce in
I  the final lefusal of France to perform the engage-
ments entered into by her; or whether we should,
m a manner peifectly iespectful to France, and
with a prop"!  spiutot forbearance towards her,
wait the fuither action of tie French Chamber
before Ae c une to any final and deflute conclu-
sion on tins subject.
