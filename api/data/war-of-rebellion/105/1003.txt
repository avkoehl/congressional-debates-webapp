Colonel JAMES H. CARLETON,

First Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding Dist. of Southern California, Los Angeles, Cal.:

COLONEL: I do not wish you to send out any new expedition to the Mono country until you shall have received reports from Lieutenant-Colonel Evans, when you can exercise your own judgment in the matter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE PACIFIC,San Francisco, Cal., April 14, 1862.

Colonel JAMES H. CARLETON,

First Infantry California Volunteers,

Commanding Dist. of Southern California, Los Angeles, Cal.:

COLONEL: In consequence of the continued Indian disturbances in the District of Humboldt I was compelled to withdraw the two companies of the Second Infantry at Santa Barbara, under Lieutenant-Colonel Olney, and send them to re-enforce Colonel Lippitt. This will make it necessary for you to leave a company of the Fifth at San Diego. I have no reliable information as to the state of affairs either in Arizona or New Mexico, but I have no doubt of Canby's ability to sistain himself against any rebel force which may approach him. With the main objects of the expedition intrusted to your direction you are well adquainted, viz, to drive out or capture all rebels in Arizona and retake the forts in that country and New Mexico, now in possession of the rebels. Every exertion has been made to provide your troops with all necessary supplies. My design in the first instance was for you to advance from Fort Yuma with your own regiment and Shinn's battery, with five companies First Cavalry; but on the eve of your departure from Yuma you will be better able to judge of the propriety of adding a portion of Bowie's regiment to your moving columns, which you are authorized to do, if you think it proper. Do not hesitate about taking all the force you think necessary to accomplish the object in view.

Wishing you all the success which your labor and zeal in making the necessary preparations so justly entitle you to, I am, colonel, very truly, your obedient servant,

G. WRIGHT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
