and it is too good luck to believe we are yet clear of her. Our hopes are upon the Monitor, and this days' work shows that the Merrimac must attend to her alone. Have ordered the large frigates to leave.

HENRY B. RENWICK, Esq., New York:

Your dispatch of this morning received.* Why not take, say, three large and swift steamers, drawing not more then 16 feet of water when loaded, fill their bows, and strengthen them generally, and protected their machinery with timber? Could not three such vessels be fitted up and made ready for sea in three or four days, and would they not be sufficient for the destruction of the Merrimac by running her down, if managed by volunteer commanders and crews? Telegraph immediately for Carryall to return.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of war.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

March 10, 1862.

Governor ANDREW, Boston:

The Merrimac is reported by General Wool as having returned to Norfolk in a sinking condition, but Assistant Secretary For, who is also at Fort Monroe, reports that it is not known whether she is disabled or not.

My telegram to you respecting your defenses was sent before it was known that the Monitor had reached Fort Monroe, and it was unknown what further mischief might be done by the Merrimac. All the information possessed by the War Department respecting affairs sat Fort Monroe is allowed to pass by the telegraph for public information. Any special information important to public safety will be communicated to you.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Above dispatch sent to-

Gov. E. D. Morgan, Albany, N. Y.

Gov. John A. Andrew, Boston, Mass.

Gov. Israel Washburn, jr., Augusta, Me.
