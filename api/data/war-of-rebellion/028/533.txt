FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, [VA.,] November 2, 1862-9 a. m.

Colonel CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that my division has passed Fairfax Court-House. The head of my column is half-way between Fairfax and Centreville, where I shall halt until General Steinwehr's division, of Sigel's corps, passes me. I have communicated with General Sigel, at Fairfax, and will relieve his post at Fairfax Station, Burke's Station, and Fairfax Court-House. I shall be in position with my whole command, pursuant to orders.

Very respectfully, yours,

D. E. SICKLES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Same to Marcy, chief of staff.)

CENTREVILLE, November 2, 1862-3 p. m.

Colonel CHAUNCEY McKEEVER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that the head of my column has passed Centreville. Here I shall halt to give necessary repose to my men, and to allow the remainder of Steinwehr's division to proceed. I halted for this purpose about two hours since, when three regiments of that division advanced. I leave a strong regiment here (One hundred and twentieth New York), Colonel Sharpe relieving General Stahel's force at this post. General Sigel has strong detachments at Bull Run Bridge and Union Mills, which he will withdraw, and expects me to relieve. He admonished me of the necessity of strong detachments at those points. Shall I occupy them? If General Stahel withdraws his cavalry posts at Chantilly, Brentsville, Bristoe, Catlett's, Greenwich, and Gainesville, I respectfully suggest that sufficient cavalry should report to me for outposts, patrols, and vedettes.

Very respectfully,

D. E. SICKLES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

(Same to Marcy.)
