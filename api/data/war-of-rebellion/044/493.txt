the latter was a division commander (General [F. C.]Barlow), who was severely wounded. I was here ordered by Major-General Early to halt. I had no means of ascertaining the number of the enemy's wounded by the fire of this brigade, but if these were in the usual proportion to his killed, nearly 300 of whom were buried on the ground where my brigade fought, his loss in killed and wounded must have exceeded the number of men I carried into action. Neither was it possible for me take any account of the prisoners sent to the rear, but the division inspector credits this brigade with about 1, 800. I carried into action about 1, 200 men, one regiment having been detached, as above stated. The loss of the brigade in killed and wounded was 350, of whom 40 were killed. *The movement during the succeeding days of the battle (July 2 and 3), I do not consider of sufficient importance to mention. In the afternoon of July 5, on the retreat from Gettysburg my brigade, acting as rear guard, was pressed by the enemy near Fairfield, PA. I was ordered by Major-General Early to hold him in check until the wagon and division trains could be moved forward. Detaching one regiment (THE twenty-sixth Georgia), I deployed it and after a spirited skirmish succeeded in driving back the enemy's advance guard and in withdrawing this regiment through the woods, with the loss of killed and wounded. On July 14, this brigade, with division, recrossed the Potomac at Williamsport. It would be gratifying, and in accordance with my sense of justice, to mention the acts of individual courage which came under my own observation, and which have been reported to me, but as the exhibition of this virtue was the general rule, I should do injustice to many if I attempted it.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. GORDON.
