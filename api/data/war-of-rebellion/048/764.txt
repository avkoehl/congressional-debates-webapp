seemed as if the enemy would turn us, and I was not much surprised when I saw my line turn and move backward slowly and reluctantly. I saw that it was general, and thereupon did not attempt to stop it till it got back to where I had posted my battery.

Meantime another battery (K, of the Fourth U. S. Artillery) had been posted on the same ground, making in one close line twelve light twelves. Brigadier- General Ward, in the critical moment of this retirement, sen to me an aide- de- camp, letting me know that he was in the thicket on the left side of the road, and desirous to act, as he always is on such occasions, and at my request he marched a line of his brigade by the right flank across the road so as to show it in rear of the battery. This had a magical effect, as it spoke to the eye what in the noise might not be heard. All the officers of my staff and the brigade staff suddenly disseminated my orders among the troops to halt at the battery, and they did so, restoring their formation with wonderful quickness. The moment the battery was unmasked by our men, it opened with the utmost rapidity, deluging the rebel ranks with double charges of canister.

It was soon evident the enemy was stopped, and once more my division moved forward in as good order as at the fires time. There was a general halt of the whole line on arriving at the position from which we had retired, and, it being near night, my division gave three cheers for the Union and made their dispositions to sleep on the field.

On the following morning, the division, in its place in the column, bringing up the rear, moved via Germanna Ford road to Robertson's Tavern, and thence to the position taken up by the corps in front of Mine Run. On the 29th, the division received orders to be in readiness at daybreak to proceed on a reconnaissance. In the course of the day it reconnoitered the east bank of Mine Run to the plank road and drove all the pickets of the enemy in its route to the other side of the run. Bivouacked at night on the right of and near to the Second Corps, connecting pickets with the Second Corps and the main body of the Third Corps. On the 30th, marched early by the left flank to the plank road, and took position on the left of the plank road, west side of Mine Run, and on the of the Second Corps in line of battle in front of the enemy's works. Remained in line of battle all day and retired at night camping on the left of the Third Corps. At 6 p. m. on the 1st of December, left the bivouac and marched by newly made route to the plank road, and thence to Culpeper Mine ford, where we crossed the Rapidan and bivouacked. On the 2nd, marched to our late bivouac near Brandy Station.

The accompanying list of casualties shows a loss of 2 officers and 25 enlisted men killed; 3 officers and 132 enlisted men wounded; 1 officer and 25 enlisted men missing.* If it is any satisfaction for the gallant spirits we have lost, we know that they were fearfully avenged, and that the cause of treason met with a severe blow at their hands. T	he field was left covered with rebel dead and wounded. A list of the names of 37 prisoners taken by the provost- marshal of this division is herewith inclosed.

In this fatiguing and rough campaign I have not ceased to admire the cheerfulness and self- possession with which every kind of duty has been done in this division. On every occasion in which I can render that justice to individuals which is impossible in this report, I shall do so without fail. The indispensable assistance rendered to
