CAPE GIRARDEAU, December 26, 1864.

General EWING,

Commanding:

The force sent toward Cherokee Bay could cross the Saint Francis. There is eight feet of water in that river. They march from Bloomfield this morning in the direction of Kennett and Horse Island. Will reach Horse Island to-morrow. The force is 100 strong, not having been joined by the Dallas detail on account of high water.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.

SAINT LOUIS, December 26, 1864.

Captain G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Send out from Macon fifty of the best mounted men you can muster, under an officer who will not rest day or night until Jim Jackson and his infernal clan are exterminated. Send officer who will give the bushwhackers' friends to understand that they will share the same fate. Captain Glaze is the best man to take hold of this matter if he can possibly be spared. Captain Benecke don't seem to be rendering the service he should.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MACON, December 26, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK,

saint Louis, Mo.:

I sent Captain Le Clair and twenty-five men, Seventh Illinois Cavalry, from here last night, with instructions to go into Chariton County and stay there until he did everything possible. Another scout starts from Glasgow this a. m. Captain Benecke has just returned from saint Louis, and unless he stays with his command more, will avail you nothing. I don't's bet on him.

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
