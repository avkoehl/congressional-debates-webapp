HEADQUARTERS THIRD CAVALRY DIVISION,Shepherdstown Ford, August 28, 1864-9.15 a.m.

Captain M. A. RENO,

Chief of Staff:

CAPTAIN: Having received an order implying that the army at Harper's Ferry was to have moved this morning at daylight, I have concluded to cross and move out toward Kearneysville without waiting for any direct instructions. I am sure this course will meet with the general's instructions when he knows reconnaissance five or six miles in all directions from here confirm the opinion that the rebels have gone. I have waited from 6 to this time to hear from somebody. Time is precious and therefore I act as seems best, hoping it will meet with the general's approbation. Custer left here last night for Harper's Ferry.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brigadier-General.
