The following is a copy of a telegram just received from General Sherman. I send it to you as he has directed me to keep youadvised of his movements by every opportunity:

General EASTON,

New Berne:

The capture of Selma is also announced in rebel papers. I expect every hour an answer from General Johnston, but shall start to-morrow toward Ashborough unless he makes clear and satisfactory terms. You have better hold yourself prepared to give clear and satisfactory terms. You have better hold yourself prepared to give us forage here when the railroad is done, as we have enough provision on hand, but send nothing this side of Goldsborough till ordered by myself, or some army commander.

Major-General.
