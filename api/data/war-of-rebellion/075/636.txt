Major- General SHERMAN:

General King reports that between 10 and 2 o'clock last night there was what appeared to be movements of troops, wagons, and artillery on his front toward the enemy's right. The movement was noisy, men singing and shouting as if driving cattle. General Thomas has gone to the right.

JUNE 29, 1864.

Major- General SHERMAN:

From all I can learn the enemy did not leave his works, but opened a heavy fire upon Colonel Delworth, whose man replied in like manner, and in the darkness the officers could not see sufficiently well to judge whether the attack was real or feint.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major- General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Kenesaw, June 29, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Before I make the move contemplated I will want General Schofield to drive the enemy on the Sandtown road well down the peninsula between Nickajack and Sweet Water. Can you group your command so as to cove the space from General McPherson to and including the Powder Springs road!

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major- General, Commanding.
