On the 19th the enemy forced a landing on the South Carolina side, so near my communication that to save the garrison it became necessary to give up the city. Its evacuation was successfully accomplished last night. All the light artillery and most of the stores, munitions, &c., were brought off. I learn that there is a misapprehension as to the force disposable for the defense of Savannah. it summed up, land side and water side, militia, reserve, dismounted cavalry, local and details, 9,089.
