Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Colonel Brownlow reports from Marietta that he has just reached there, having escaped from a disaster that overtook General McCook's cavalry expedition at Newman. He reports the expedition reached the railroad and destroyed more road than the rebels can repair in fifteen days, and burned 500 bagged wagons, including the headquarters train of the rebel army, but was overtaken at Newman by rebel cavalry and infantry, and after a hard fight had to surrender. Colonel Harrison was killed.* I can hardly believe it, as had 3,000 picked cavalry. Colonel Brownlow commanded one of the regiments, and brought in with him but few men. I have sent for him from Marietta, to inquire more closely into the matter. I have reported General Garrard's safe return. General Stoneman used him as a cover to get a good start, so that he will probably reach Macon, and it may be Andersonville, but will have to run the gauntlet to get back safe. the loss of this cavalry is a serious one to me, but we are pushing the enemy close. Considerable re-enforcements of militia and dismounted cavalry have reached Atlanta, under Stephen D. Lee.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Washington, D. C.:

Colonel Brownlow is here and reports that General McCook proceeded according to his orders, and reached the Macon railroad and destroyed twelve miles and a bridge over a branch of White Water, which he says, is as long as that over Chattahoochee. He also destroyed 500 wagons, among them the headquarters wagons of Hood and Hardee. Unfortunately, instead of completing the circuit by the east and north, he then turned back and commenced breaking up the West Point road, about Newman, when he was attacked by infantry and cavalry in overwhelming force, and Brownlow says all were killed or captured, except such as cut their was out. Nearly 500 are now back in Marietta, and he thinks more will get in. Colonel Brownlow's account is not yet satisfactory to me, but is the best I can get.

General WEBSTER,

Nashville:

I am afraid that General McCook's command of cavalry, 3,000 strong, has been caught and captured at Newman, after having broken the railroad and burned 300 wagons of the enemy; so Colonel Brownlow reports by telegraph from Marietta, he having escaped. Order General
