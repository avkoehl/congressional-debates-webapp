right General Butler extended around well toward the Yorktown road without finding a point unguarded. I shall keep our troops out where they are until toward noon to-morrow, in hope of inviting an attack. This reconnaissance, which I had intended for more, points out to me what is to be done.

CITY POINT, VA., October 28, 1864-9 a. m.

The enemy attacked our left (Hancock) last evening with great vigor. I cannot give the results yet, though the fight was sanguinary on both sides and resulted in a considerable number of captured. General hancock thinks he captured more prisoners than he lost. I will try to give you full particulars during the day.

CITY POINT, VA., October 28, 1864.

The attack on General Hancock, now that a report is received, proved to be a decided success. He repulsed the enemy and remained in his position, holding possession of the field until midnight, when he commenced withdrawing. Orders had been given for the withdrawal of the Second Corps before the attack was made. We lost no prisoners except the usual stragglers who are always picked up. Our captures for the day on the sough side foot up 910. The rebel General Dearing is reported killed. General Meade in his report says:

I am induced to believe the success of the operations, which was most decided, was mainly due to the personal exertions of Major-General Hancock and the conspicuous gallantry of Brigadier-General Egan.

CITY POINT, VA., November 7, 1864.

Our loss in killed, wounded, and missing in the attack on our picket-line the night of the 5th, proves to be only 20. Deserters from that portion of the enemy's line making the attack say theirs was about 200. Our captures were 42 prisoners and some entrenching tools. The enemy have asked permission to bury their dead under flag.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
