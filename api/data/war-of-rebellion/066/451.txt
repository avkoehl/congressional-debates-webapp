CHARLESTON, S. C., April 26, 1864.

General SAMUEL COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

All of General Colquitt's brigade has not yet arrived. General Hagood's brigade can move as promptly as Colquitt's. It has been stationery during the whole siege; is about as large as Colquitt's; better armed and equipped, and Hagood and his officers are anxious to go. Colquitt's brigade has been moving, and is much jaded. May I send Hagood's brigade instead of Colquitt's? Please answer promptly.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 26, 1864.

Brigadier General R. S. RIPLEY,

Mount Pleasant:

I did not receive your telegram of yesterday until to-day. Will send you a cavalry company as soon as one reports, which I expect in a few days. I want to see you and the most important points in your district. Will come to your headquarters to-morrow if nothing occurs to prevent. Can you provide me with an ambulance or horse, or shall I carry over my own horse?

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., April 26, 1864.

Brigadier General W. B. TALIAFERRO,

Royall's House, James Island:

As Colquitt's brigade has not all arrived, I will not start it until I have time to receive a reply from the War Department to my telegram suggesting that Hagood's brigade to in its place. Have that part of Colquitt's brigade with you ready to start, but await further orders.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
