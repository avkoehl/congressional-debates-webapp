only the forerunner of the call
Mr. CL^Y if Kentucky contended ihat 10 call
CTtldbe calcjlated on u'l tve proc'ama ion was
made by the Executive. He ha I, however, no
hesitation in spying that it was his opinion as early
as November, that there should be a ca'lsd session
for the purpose of passing those great measures
for whieb. the peij le were so anxnus. Tne Sena-
tor from Alabama seemed to th nk it vas neces
sary to have this resolution answered w thoat de-
lay, as 11 there wao ¡>ny lung bffore Cmgreos at

and sorre mng o?*r a million issued, leaving a ba-
lance of so much e?s ly ascer a nee'
Mr CLAY of Altbama remained the Sena cr
from Kentucky that wlen during the last ges ior,he
he bad made the strange declaration that thtir
should be a called =ession, and when it wai n lo-
rióos, tt at a terwards the Pies dent elect had in
his sptech in Vtrgmia announced it, there could
be noth ng eKe in view when the franaT of this re-
solutitn was vn ing ¡t, but this very called ses 1 n
