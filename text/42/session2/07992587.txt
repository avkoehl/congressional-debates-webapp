mnvdeouiexpedient: Provided, lhatUm0ress
shall have power to alter, amend, or repeal this act.
Xhe'amendment was agreed to.
Mr. HOLMAN. I think this last proposi-
tion should go further. I think the experi-
ence of the country demonstrates very clearly
that Congress and all other legislative bodies
should reserve to themselves the power of regu-
lating the cost of transportation of passengers
and freight. I think that it is so important a
power that it ought not to be omitted from acts
of this kind. 1 ask leave to submit an amend'
ment to the last clause.
Mr. STARKWEATHER. In the fifth sec-
tion of the bill it is provided that the charge
for transporting freight within the District shall
not exceed eight cents per ton per mile, and
that for passenger travel, for any shorter dis-
tance than four miles of road, the fare shall
not exceed twelve cents.
Mr. HOLMAN. I think Congress should
distinctly reserve the power to impose further
limitations. Where this power has been pre-
served in the organization of the railroad sys-
tem, 1 find there has been an entire freedom
from the embarrassments to which the whole
western country now finds itself subjected in
this respect.
Mr. STARKWEATHER. I see no objec-
tion to such a reservation. I will hear the
gentleman's amendment.
Mr. HOLMAN. I submit the following
amendment, to come in at the end of section
five:
And Congress reserves the power to further regu-
late the cost of transportation of persons and freight
over said road within said District.
The amendment was agreed to.
The bill, as amended, was ordered to.be
engrossed and road a third time; and being
engrossed, it was accordingly read the third
time, and passed.
Mr. STARKWEATHER moved to recon-
sider the vote by which the bill was passed;
and also moved that the motion to reconsider
be laid on the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.
Mr. STARKWEATHER. I now yield to
my colleague on the committee, the gentle-
man from Vermont, [Mr. Poland.]
