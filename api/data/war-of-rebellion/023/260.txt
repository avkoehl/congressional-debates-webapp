General Nelson further requests me to say that from all he can gather the rebels do not intend to go to Battle Creek at all, but to come here (McMinnville) along the high road, which does not go by Battle Creek, but crosses in a direct line to the Sequatchie Valley, and thence in nearly a straight line to the headwaters of the Collins River and to McMinnville, the distance being about 65 miles. General Nelson thinks this information reliable. He further states in a private note that the enemy have fallen back before him and will doubtless cross the mountains.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 4, 1862.

General CRUFT, Murfreesborough:

General McCOOK, Battle Creek:

Have you got the ammunition from Stevenson to make up your 80 rounds per man? If not, get it at once. Have you and Crittenden got clothing yet; if not, what is the trouble about it? Your division trains are on the march to Dechered and will join you when wanted. It would be well to send Boyd up there in a day or two to overhaul them and get them in order, but don't move them from there at present.

General McCOOK; Battle Creek:

Several men of your division on the way from Nashville to Murfreesborough yesterday shot at and destroyed the telegraph wire. They are ordered to your headquarters under guard. The general wishes them tried promptly and punished. Perhaps it will be best to put the charge under 99th article of war and allude to the injury to the service by breaking the wire and thus jeopardizing the welfare of the army. They can also be charged with wanton destruction of public property. Do it quickly.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 4, 1862.

Major MURRAY, Athens:

Post one of your battalions in camp near Pulaski, and direct the commanding officer to report by telegraph and letter to General Negley at Columbia and await his orders. This battalion should take its baggage,
