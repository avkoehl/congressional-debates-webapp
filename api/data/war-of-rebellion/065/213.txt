FORTS SUMTER, May 20, 1864 - 10 a. m.

SIR; I have the honor to report that six of enemy's boats came between this fort and James Island, as far as the line of telegraph posts, about 1.30 a. m. When they turned to go out, I fired 4 shells at them from boat howitzer, but without hurting them. The enemy replied with 3 shots from Gregg, none of which struck. A shot was also fired from a howitzer in one of the boats, which passed over. Lieutenant Cannon, Company F, Twentieth Regiment, was wounded in the heel by a gun accidentally fired by one of his own men. The monitor on picket has removed her torpedo guard.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SUMTER, May 21, 1864 - 7 o'clock.

The enemy have just brought a 30-pounder Parrott down to Gregg, to replace, I suppose, the one removed a few days ago.
