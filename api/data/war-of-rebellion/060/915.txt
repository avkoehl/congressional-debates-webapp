SIR: I have the honor to forward you a copy of a dispatch received from the provost-marshal at Eastville, Va.:

EASTVILLE, April 18, 1864-12 p. m.

Major R. S. DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am informed by a rebel mail-carrier, captured to-day, that guerrillas are preparing for a raid at some sport between the Piankatank and Saluda, Middlesex County. I presume this raid is intended for this shore, if on foot as represented. Further information leads me to believe the information correct.

FRANK J. WHITE,

Major and Provost-Marshal.

This dispatch is sent for your information and such action as you may think proper.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

A. F. PUFFER,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.
