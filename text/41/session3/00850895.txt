1871.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
895
oat, and the Senate agreed to my motion strik- j
ing out the preamble. I was on a sick-bed this |
morning when my servant brought me the j
paper and I read that resolution. It is a reso- j
lution that is going to Prussia; that is going j
to France. I recollected that Prussia had re- !
moved barbarism from modern warfare : that j
there is the University of Berlin ; that there is â€¢
the University of Bonn. That resolution, too, j
is to go to France, where there are learned j
men who read your language as well as their I
own. I simply say now that I would expose '
the language of this resolution if it were not
that to do so would be aspersing my country.
1 move a reconsideration of the vote by which
that resolution was passed, simply that the
members of the Senate may read it and see
whether it reads better backward or forward,
whether there is more sense in it oneway than
the other.
1 say it is a disgrace to the American peo-
ple to send out such a resolution so worded ;
and if there is any scholar in this body who
v/ili examine it he will agree with me. I am
very glad that I do not know who was the
gentleman that offered the resolution, because
my remarks might be considered a reflection
on him personally. I do not know who offered
it, and 1 do not want anybody to tell mo ; but
certainly there are some scholars in this body.
1 move a reconsideration of the vote.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will ;
state to the Senator from Delaware that what
he proposes is not a question of privilege. A
motion to reconsider is a privileged question,
but it differs entirely from a question of priv-
ilege. Thus the resolutions yesterday as to
the Georgia Senators were questions of priv-
ilege, while motions to reconsider are merely
privileged questions.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I make a motion to
reconsider.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
must accompany it with a resolution asking
the House of Representatives to return to the
Senate the concurrent resolution to which he
has referred, so that a motion to reconsider
may be entered. The motion cannot be acted
upon while the resolution is in the other body.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I make the motion
indicated by the Chair.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Delaware moves that the House of Represent-
atives be requested to return to the Senate the
concurrent resolution of sympathy with France
and Germany, agreed to yesterday.
Mr. POMEROY. I was the author of that
resolution. I do not know of anything wrong
about it. I think the Senator, upon reflection,
would not desire to have it returned.
Mr. SAULSBURY. Now, I am sorry my
friend has satd that. I did uot know who the
author was, and I hope he will spare me from
pointing out the inaccuracies in this resolu-
tion.
Mr. POMEROY. I would be glad to spare
the Senator if he would spare himself.
Mr. SAULSBURY. 1 simply say that I do
not wish to point out the inaccuracies: but let
the motion be entered without any remarks
from me, and let the Senator take the resolu-
tion and correct it and send it forth in English
at least. That is all I ask. If the gen tie man
insists, however, I will point out wherein such
n, resolution, coming from the Congress of the
United States, should not be addressed to
foreign nations. I say it is not good English ;
I say it is ungrammatlcal; and it is a disgrace
to the American people.
Mr. WILSON. Is this morning business?
Mr. SAULSBURY. I ask my friend from
Kansas to take his own resolution and put it
in proper shape.
TheVrCK PRESIDENT. What point does
the Senator trom Massachusetts make, if any?
Mr. WILSON. I desire to know if this is
morning hour business. I wish to introduce
some morning business.
Tito VICE PRESIDENT. A motion to
reconsider is privileged during two days after
the passage of any resolution or bill; but this
motion is not subject to debate until the con-
current resolution shall be returned from the
other House to which it has gone. The Sen-
ator has a right to enter the motion, and the
Senate has the right to act on it and decide
whether it shall or shall not be returned.
Mr. POMEROY. Let us act on it now.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Delaware moves that the House of Rep-
r-sentatives be requested to return the con-
current resolution of sympathy with France
and Germany to the Senate.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I am willing'that it
shall lie over.
Mr. POMEROY. No, I want to vote now.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It is now before
the Senate, and the question is on agreeing to
the motion of the Senator from Delaware.
The question being put, the Vice President
declared that the noes appeared to have it.
Mr. SAULSBURY. I call for the yeas
and nays; and on that I will address the Scn-
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
put the question on ordering the yea3 and
nays.
The yeas and nays were not ordered, but
four Senators rising to second the call.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The noes have
it. The morning business will be resumed.
Reports of committees are in order.

time more to live. It is Senate bill No. 1008.

mittees are still in order. The Senator from

.TEAUUJI ATKINS.
Mr. WILLEY. At the last session a bill
was passed for the relief of Jearum Atkins,
authorizing him to apply for an extension of
a patent, but the bill by some inadvertence
misreeited the date of the patent. The Com-
mittee on Patents have instructed me this
morning to report back Senate bill No. 1271
without amendment, which is identical with
the bill to which I refer, except that it corrects
the date of the patent: and if it be the pleasure
of the Senate, I should like to have the bill
put on its passage now.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as ift
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the biil (S. No. 1271) to amend an act
for the relief of Jearum Atkins, approved July
15, 1870. It proposes to amend the act en-
titled "Aft act for the relief of Jearum At-
kins," approved July 15, 1870, so as to read
as follows:
"That the Commissioner of Patents be,, and ho
hereby is, authorized to entertain and exercise juris-
diction over a petition of Jearum Atkins for tho
extension of letters-patent granted to him on the
"1st day of December, 1852, for a further term ot
seven years from the day on whieh soch extension
may bo granted, and to hear and determine upon
the said petition in the same manner and with tno
same effect as if tho original term of said patent had
not expired, and to grant or refuse such extension
upon tho same principles that govern his decisions
upon such applications when made in due course ot
law: Provided, That before granting any extension
upon sueh petition the Commissioner shall be satis-
fied that the same will inure to the sole benefit ot
said Atkins: And provided further, That no person
shall bo hold liable for tho infringement of said
patent, if extended, for makinguse ot said invention
since tho expiration of the original term of said
patent, and prior to the date of its extension.
The bill was reported to the Senate with-
out amendment, ordered to be engrossed for a
