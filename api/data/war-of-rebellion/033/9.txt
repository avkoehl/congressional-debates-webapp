We had a grand scare here yesterday. General Davies sent an aide to me in great haste, at 9 a.m., with the intelligence that we were attacked on the right, and ordered my command into line of battle immediately We Missourians astonished the general commanding with our prompt attention to orders, and, indeed, it would have pleased the venerable Pea Ridge himself to have seen his boys spring to arms. Not an attack had we. Happy New Year was not disturbed by mortality lists, or groans from the wounded. The irregular discharge of arms by the guard relieved had created the alarm. Colonel Moore, with the Twenty-first Missouri and Thirty-third Iowa, is out on the railroad line 20 miles. Construction trains are within 8 miles of each other, but there is much trestle work to rebuild. I fear General Davies will not be able to open and maintain the line. Memphis must be made the base of supplies for General Grant's army. Colonel Hughes has gone to repossess New Madrid. No rebel force has yet occupied the post. It was a great shame to have abandoned it at all. Colonel Scott ought to be ordered back there, and send Colonel Hughes, with his full regiment, down the river. I am now waiting telegram from you touching our destination below. I fear you will have to telegraph General Halleck before we are again in your department.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. LEFT WING, FORCES AT FORT COLUMBUS, KY.,January 2, 1863.

Brigadier General THOMAS A. DAVIES,

Commanding District of Columbus, Ky.:

GENERAL: I am in receipt of orders from General Curtis, directing me to proceed to Helena, at the earliest possible moment, with the forces from his department temporarily on duty at this post.

General Gorman, anticipating my arrival at Helena with the forces from General Curtis now on duty here, ordered nearly all of his command to join General Sherman in his expedition against Vicksburg. The rebel forces of Hindman and Marmaduke, having been driven from Van Buren, will probably concentrate with the force at Austin and march on Helena, while General Gorman is weak. I would like your permission to commence the shipment of my regiments at the earliest moment you consider the safety of Columbus will permit; the Twenty-first Missouri and Thirty-third Iowa being now out on the railroad with construction train, had better remain until they can be spared from the line. Will you allow me to order transportation for the Thirty-third and Thirty-fifth Missouri Infantry, Tenth Missouri Cavalry, and Twenty-ninth Iowa Infantry? The Twenty-eighth Wisconsin Infantry might be given to me in place of the Thirty-third Iowa, now out on the line. You will then have three Iowa, one Missouri, and one Illinois regiment left here, in addition to the regulars.

General Curtis is so very urgent that I should lose no time in getting forward after your safety is beyond doubt, that I now respectfully request that I be permitted to order the necessary transportation.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
