THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 25,
eron, and of his having taken them with hira from
that room to his house find thence to the Department
of State on the morning of Saturday, May 6, was
read to the witness]
The "Witness. Mr. Davis mav have receivod a
package there by a messenger. I am not sure about
that; but ho had no occasion to give me a copy of
the treaty afterward if he gave me one then. He
gave me a copy at the State Department on the 8th.
He only gave me one copy of the revise, I know,
and I feel very sure he gave me that at the State
Department. Mr. Davis only says in hi3 letter that
he gave me one copy of the revise, " that a new re-
vise was printed May 5, a copy of which was given
to you and also to several other Senators before the
Senate met." He gave me only one copy of each
print, and rnv impression is that he gave me the last
at the State Department. If he left it at my room
that night, it has entirely escaped my recollection.
I think the first night he was at my room was on
Saturday night.
Question. Not Friday?
Answer. I think it was Saturday night, but I am
not sure. If I got the copy at my room, and not at
the State Department, I am very much mistaken;
but one thing I am very ccrtain of: I never had but
one copy. In this letter of his he does not pretend
that he ever gave me more than one copy of each
print. I would ask whether he stated that he after-
ward gave me another copy at the State Depart-
ment?
Tho Chairman. No ; he did not.
The Witness. Did he have any understanding
that he gave me more than one copy of the last
print?
The Chairman. Oh, no; nothing of that kind was
said.
The Witness. He is mistaken, I think, abouthis
having given it to me at my room. X think he gavo
it to me at the same time that he gave it to Senator
Frelinguuysen and Senator Patterson. I think
ho gave it to them on Monday.
By Mr. Conkling:
Question. Where at the State Department, and
from whom, did you receive your copy, assuming
that you received it there ?
Answer. It was in Mr. Davis's own room, in his
oftiee, and. I think, from himself. My impression is
that he handed it to me himself What makes me
remember it the more is that I think there was a
clerk there, his confidential clerk, who had the
copies and took them out of the lower part of a
book-case or something of the sort. I have a gen-
eral recollection that the clerk took them out: of
something in our preseneo there, and that tho clerk
had them, and that Mr. Davis took them from him.
Question. Who is that clerk?
Ansiver. I am not Hire as to his name. He is a
young gentleman who stays with him. I have a
general recollection that the clerk had them in his
possession.
By Mr. Trumbull:
Question. Oouid it be possible that Mr. Davis
might have left a copy witli you on Friday night,
the 5th of May, and you never have observed it?
Annwf/'. Such a thing might be possible. I would
not s, y it was uot possible; but I do not think it was
probable.
By Mr. Davis, of Kentucky:
Question. You have no fact and no causo to bolieve
that you ever received from Assistant Secretary
Davis any but two copies?
Answer. I never saw but the two copies. It is
barely possible that 1 might have obtained the sec-
ond copy at my room and have had the other im-
pression, because copies were handed out on Mon-
day when I was at the State Department; but my
recollection is thatl gotmyseconacopy at the State
Department.
Question. Were the copies which were delivered
at the State Department delivered at the same time
to all the Senators who were then present?
Answer. I think thero were several copies deliv-
ered there at that time.
By the Chairman:
Question. And you think you got yours at the same
time that Mr. Frelingjiuysen, Mr. Patterson, and
Mr. Hamlin got theirs?
Answer. I think Mr. Frelincjiiuysen, Mr. Ham-
lin, and Mr. Patterson were there and got theirs
at tho same time. I will not bo certain that they
all got them; but T know the treaty was brought
out there, and I think several copies were distrib-
uted.
By Mr. Conkltnq :
Question. Was Mr. Cameron there?
Answer. I think Mr. Cameron was there, but I am
not suie about that. Mr. Cameron and 1 did meet
there. I went up to the State Department first on
Friday, on my arrival, and I met him there once, lie
was there when I got there. Iam rather inclined
to think, too, that Mr. Cameron was there again on
Monday, and that he and I went from there to the
President's, on Friday or on Monday, I am not cer-
tain which.
By the Chairman:
Question. Do you remember whether Mr. Cameron
received a copy at the State Department at that
tune ?
Answer. I do not.
Question. Was Mr. Ramsdell in your room after
you got back here, previous to tho meeting of the
benate on Wednesday, May 10?
Arnaver. Y^s, sir; I think two or three times.
Question. Was beat anytime ever left alone in
the room I
Answer. Never.
Question. Was he therein the day-time or in the
evening?
Anstver. I think Mr. Ramsdell usually came to the
National Hotel about six o'clock in the evening. 1
think there are several places he was in the habit of
going to when he came there. He nearly always went
to Judge Williams's room. I know that, because I
have heard him talk about it, and X know he was in
the habit of visiting Judge Williams.
Question. Did he ever at any time, in your room,
see the treaty so that he could see or know anything
that there was in it ?
Answer. I think it is very likely that I had the
treaty out on my table at some time when Mr. Rams-
dell was there, because I was reading the treaty
pretty closely at that time, and read it over a good
many times, and Mr. Ramsdell may have seen the
treaty on my table.
Question. I asked if ho had over seen it so that he
could know anything that there was in it?
Answer. No, sir. Nobody but myself had an op-
portunity of reading a line while it was on my table
or in my hands, and I think it was never in any-
body's hands. I do notthink anybody evertouched
it until I handed the copy to Dr. Taft to put into
the fire. I gave it to Dr. Taft to put in the fire,
not to have a witness of what I did, for that did
notoccur to me, but because it was more convenient
for him to do it than for me. I was sitting back near
the window. I did not get him burn' it that I might
have somebody see me burn it, but because it is not
so easy for me to get up and move about as it is for
some others.
Question. Was Mr. White ever in the room during
those days?
Answer, Mr. White was in my room once. Mr.
White was in my room on Tuesday or Wednesday
evening, X do not know which.
Question. That is, Tuesday or Wednesday, the 9th
or 10th of May?
Answer. Yes, sir. At the time Mr. White was
there my impression is thatMr. Morris of the Chron-
icle was in there at the same time. I will not be
certain, but my impression is that Mr. Morris was
there at the same time, and that Mr. White went
out first and left Mr. Morris with me.
Question. Were White and Ramsdell ever there
together?
Answer. No, sir, I think not.
Question. Did you, while you were in the course
of examining the treaty or studying it, ever leave it
on the table and go to sleep in the room, or anything
of that kind, so that anybody could have come into
the room and you not know it?
Answer, No, sir. I knew that the treaty was being
sought, for, and I was very careful about it. When
I wentto breakfastordinner I always had the treaty
put up into my trunk. My servant, a colored man,
could testify to the committee on that point. He
did not know what the treaty was; he is very illit-
erate, but he can testify that whenever I went out
of tho room certain papers wero put into the trunk,
and he always locked tlio trunk lor me and brought
me the key. lie would take my bunch of keys,
unlock the trunk, and then bring the keys back to
me. May I ask whether Mr. Davisleavesany doubt
about the question as to whether he gavo me more
than one copy of the last proof?
The Chairman. Nothing was said about that in
anyway; but he testified simply, as you have heard,
that he delivered to you and Mr. Cameron a copy
each on Friday in your room. Ho did not testify
about having delivered you a copy at the State
Department at all.
Mr. Trumbull. It did not occur to us that there
was any question as to your having had more than
two copies.
Mr. Davis, of Kentucky. I do not think it was in
his mind.
Mr. Conkling. No suggestion of that kind was
mnde.
The Witness. The reason! asked that question
was this: after the treaty had been published in tho
Tribune Mr. Davis carao up to the room of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations to read his journal, at
the request of the committee, and the matter was
talked about there, and Mr. Davis said that there
had been only a certain number of copies printed
and that he could account for every one of them.
It is very certain that I never saw but the two copies
and never received but the two copies at his hands,
one of the first and one of the last proof.
[Senator Morton subsequently addressed to the
committee the following statement, to be appended
to his testimony:
United States Senate Chamber,
Washington, May 24,1871.
To the Chairman of the Special Committee :
Since my examination last night I have had a con-
versation with Hon. J. C. B. Davis, in which he
brought it to my recollection that while he was at
my room at the National Hotel, on the evening of
the 5th instant, his clerk came in with a package of
the treaty while he was reading to Senator Cameron
and myself his private diary of the proceedings of
the high commission; that he opened it, and gave
each of us acopy and immediately resumed his read-
ing. This was the final proof of the treaty which
had been taken that day, and 1 am satisfied I was
mistaken in the impression that I did not receive
my copy of it until the following Monday at the State
Department. Mr. Davis says that on the following
Monday at the Department he gave me acopy of
the protocol, but not the treaty, and gave both pro-
tocol and treaty to Senators Patterson, Freling-
huysen, and Hamlin, who had not received either
of them before. As I never had but one copy of the
State Department final proof of the treaty taken on
the 5th instant, I am satisfied thatMr. Davis is right
*.nd thatl received it at my room, and not at the
Department. I have just received from him the
inclosed letter, which I beg leave to incorporate in
my statement. This statement I submit as acorrec-
tion of my statement last night, and desire to have
it entered as such, but will go before the committee
at its next meeting if desired.
0. P. MORTON.
May 24,1871.
Dear Sir : Referring to our conversation this morn-
ing, I beg to say that on the evening of Friday, the 5th
May, I was at your rooms to meet you and Senator
Cameron for the purpose of reading portions of my
private diary of the proceedings before the joint
high commission; that while wo were reading my
clerk came in from the printing office with the copies
of tho new revise of the treaty printed thatday; that
I opened the parcel and gave acopy to Senator Cam-
eron and yourself and went on at once with the
reading, as the time was short and we wished to
finish the subject of the Alabama claims that even-
ing, if possible; and that I tied up the parcel and
took all the other copies away with me.
On Monday, the 8th, you were at the Department
with Senators Patterson, Hamlin, and Freling-
huysen. I gave each of you a copy of the protocols
which had just been printed, and also a, copy of tho
treaty to each of the Senators who had not pre-
viously received a copy. I did not then give you a
copy.
Yours, very truly, J. C. B. DAVIS.
Hon. 0. P. Morton.
Washington, D. C., May 24,1871.
Sir: In compliance with Mr. Davis's request, I
have the honor to inclose for your use a tabulated
statement of the distribution of the copies of the
two editions of the treaty printed at the Congres-
sional Printing Office, May 1 and 5.
I have the honor to be,sir,your obedient servant,
THEODORE W. DIMON.
Hon. 0. P. Morton, United States Senate.
