The Confederacy States Naval Works company has never been organized and mustered as the other local troops, but can be relied upon when needed. The companies composed of the employes on the railroads and in Souther Express Company have quite a small effective force at all time ready, in comparison with the numbers shown on their muster-rolls, owing to the nature of their employment, which keeps them constantly traveling to and from this place. The strength of the commands as shown above can be relied upon at all times.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.

DEMOPOLIS, March 15, 1864.

General MAURY,

Mobile:

Sherman has given out he is to make an expedition up Red River; I do not believe it. He and Hurlbut have gone down the river from Vicksburg with about one-half or two-thirds of his army; I think we shall hear of him on the Gulf coast; many of his troops have been furloughed and gone up the river. Keep a special lookout along the coast, especially on Pensacola.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.

DEMOPOLIS, March 15, 1864.

Major-General FORREST,

Okolona:

General Lee reports a number of Sherman's troops gone off up river on furlough; McPherson at Vicksburg; Sherman and Hurlbut gone down river with rest of army in forty-two steamers, said to be going up Red River as far as Shreveport. McPherson reports the spring campaign inaugurated by Sherman, Thomas, and Smith a failure. Chalmers is here. Your action on his case referred to War Department. I have no other orders for you besides those given when you were here. Keep me advised through the telegraph on the Mobile and Ohio Railroad.

L. POLK,

Lieutenant-General.
