Mr ADAMS piesented the following resolu-
tion:
Resolve i, That every member of the House of Represent
atives of the United Mates ought, before liking his seat
there m, to produce at the Clerk s t ib!< , or t > efe posit in the
Cleik's oihee, the crede nti lis hyvutuc ot which he claims ,
his seat, and in ill c istsot contested election, no niembei |

Mi   ADAMS explained that he had offeiod this |
resolution in consequence oí the disuse of a piac- I
tice which hail formerly existed in this House,
and which he believed lobe the piactice of tveiy
other deliberative body.  It was,, that evet y mem- j
ber who was hete as the Reptesentative of the
people should produce the credentials by vutue
of which lie claimed his seat    This pi acure had
been adopted at the first organization of the Gov-
ernment, and had been continued until within the
last eight oi ten yeais.   He did not exactly know
when  it was first disused, but since that time
every gentleman who thought pioper to do so had
come and taken his seat without havingptesented
any evidence of his being entitled thereto Mr
A did not intend to debate this resolution him-
self, noi was he awaie that there was any dispo-
sition to contest the principle. It was one the
operation of which might be of very gieat impor-
tance at the commencement of the next session of
Congress. He hoped the íesoluüon would be
disposed of now.
Objection having been made,

lules, and,aftei some desultory conversation, the
question was taken, and the motion to suspend
the íule was negatived—ayes 86, noes 62, not two
