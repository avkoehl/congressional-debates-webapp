Bankrupt Bill—Mr. Birdseye.
August, 1841.
H. of Reps.
(mainiinceipthecommunity, I know, sir, that a thoiranü
Sr-miSices w II be raised agairwt it But if the people will sus
tarn it ur. jl it has passed ita day of trial, as I believe they will,
the consequences will be happy and glorious The silent but
potent influence of this system m regulating society and in im
Droving the morals of the country, may not at once be seen,
but m the end it will be developed, and Us powerful influence
will be universally acknowledged.
Every important change in our social condition must meet
with opposition Itbreaksin on previously foimed opm.ons
and long-established habits of thinking, and must therefore be
for awhile viewed with distrust, and regarded by some as a
troublesome intruder It is this that gives me the only unea i
ness I feel about this measure in the event of its passage But,
sir, it is only that anxiety which has been always felt by the
friends of every great political or moral improvement in the
condition of ¡society When the father  of the Constitution
sent that sacred instrument furth, and asked the ratification of
Ahe people, they felt d ep anxiety for its fate They knew it
\was framed in wisdom, and would, if adopted, lay the founda
«turns of a happy Government, and an endunns political, civil,
and religious freedom Their anxiety was that the people
•should think with them Happily, the people, as they alwajs
■do when a question is fully argued before them, judged lightly
Tor the same reasons, but in an inferior degree, the fnends of
this measure feel solicitude that it may be sustained by popular
opinion; and i hey have unlimited confidence that if it i? sus
tamed it will exhibit itahappy fruils in the improved condition
of society in all future urn 
But, sir, it is not only the interests of creditors as well is
debtors, and the moral and social relations of sot ety, that will
be improved by this measure, its commercial influence will be
powerful The number of bankrupts m the United States is
stunated by gome at five hundred thousand Suppose ihe
number to be only half that, still it is sufficiently great to lit.
matter or national concern These men aie diones in the hise
—not voluntary drones, who prefer idleness to mdu=:fry, but
made drones by the operation of your laws They dare not
own any thing. Their friends and relatives daie not set them
up in business, in order that they may makcasupport for ihose
dependent on them Their lives are useless to themselves and
others. New, sir, what good is to be attained by keeping them
in this condllioni Does it benefit then creditors? No Does
l benefit socittyi No Whom does it benefitl Not one hu
man being, while it inflicts a fatal stab and rcmoisetess deith
on all the earthly hopes of these unfortunate men Thib bill
proposes to restore this numerous cla^s to actneind useful
employment—useful to themselves and families, and useful to
theircountry Sir is this not desirable* Will it not beneft
live whole commumtyl Will it not bieathe new life into the
business and productive labor of the country'' Su ely theie
can be but one answer to these questions These men will
spring into action and life, they will feel ennobled, disentan-
gled, and disenthralled, many of them will profit by then past
errors, and will become useful and highly valuable members ol
community, contributing their full share to our national great
ness and wealth Turn them loose ' Knock off tlitir chains'
Let them go free and feci the reverence for the institutions of
their country and the gratitude that their deliverence must in-
spire ' Am 1 told that this may discharge some unworthy man?
J answer, will you therefore! hold honest ones in chains? The
yams of heaven will fall on the evil and the good, on the mst
and the unjust, and some tarosare peimmed to grow ratliei
ithauthe wheatshouldbe rooted up. Ifa rogue now and then
escapes, let him go there is a tribunal whose judgment he cm
not evade It is our business to legislate for society, and we
can only control the outward conduct ol men, the secret mo
tives and wicked concealments of the hi art, which often evide
the wisest human laws, must be left to that final justice which
will be pronounced by a higher and holier tribunal
But, sir, there is one effect that will be pioduced by the pis
nsgeof this bill that has athnlling liueieMrtft Us tontempla
Hon It is the joy that this measure will difluí  into moie
than a million ol aching hearts The banki uptsin the United
States, and those dependant on tin m whose hearts will leap
with joyat the announcement of their deliveiance will not
number less than a million The number is usually estimitel
much larger Now, sir, if these could all be biougnt togetliei,
not only the unhappy bankrupts themselves, but their wive-,
their children, and all who, by ties of nature and affection,
have claims on them for support, and you could bee Hit, so
lemn sadness that reigns^ throughout, this vast mulntule an]
you could then hear the sound of their deliverance, and wit
ness the thulhng effect, what would be your emotions'
^Vould your heart not swell with unutterable rapture in view
íífthis happy scene? Would you notsee soirow turned into
joy, and witness the oversowing waves of an ocean of hap
Bines«7
Sir, this measure is calculated to fjrive more relief to moio
human beings than any you could pass The delivei ancc th it
this measure will bung will be consecrated by tears ind guti

SPEECH OP MR. BIRDSEYE,
OP NEW YORK.
Mouse of Representatives, August 13,1841—On the bill to
establish a uniform system of bankruptcy throughout the
united States
Mr BIRDSEVE said he had desired to address the commit
lee some remarks upon this bill, for reasons, to some extent,
4ipeciaHy .concerning himself, but not remote Irom the merits
$$ the bill,  As a general rule, he preferred, to act the part of a
l^tenei a id to perform the duty ofa silent vofei, being satis
fiert with deoate when he found that the arguments on whiCi
he would mainly repose his vote had been assigned by o«hei&,
S«were m appavent mat it might|be presumedly had had their
due weight upon the House But when he was cahed! upon to
give a vote upon a question of the importance of this bill, and
fe'tconstra.nedto repose his vote upon grounds which did not
seem obvious, ot to have been brought to the notice oí the com
mittee, when he found that he differed with many fnends here,
foi whom he had the highest respect, and when he might seem
to differ with a highly respectable portion of his consutuents,
he deseed to obviate any misconstruction which might be put
on his vote heie or elsewhere, should he give a silent vote, as
well as to bring to the attention of the committee reasons relat-
ing to th¿memsof the question which seemed to have been
overlooked by others If he was in error hi craved the hum
blest privi'-ge of debate—that of stating Ins objections, and
tnen of being convinced of such error by   he reasoning   of
Su (said Mr B )m the liberations prehr  mary tothe adop-
tion o'f a measure of suchimportance, wheiethe supposed po
pularwill is áo much rehed on as an argument to inñuencethe
íe^uit, I f u ipo e it to be the duty of the representative to reflect
truly the of ^lons of his constituents I feel bound then to say,
sir that although when at home I mingle constantly with my
consiHi e nts, I can now recall to mmd but two conv ersations with
any t c r ion of my constituents when the passage of a bankrupt
law v* as the subject of remaik In one of those convet^ation 
I \aistiucgly urged to favorthe measure. In the oJiei con
((.r uiun,which was with intelligent merchants the project wis
deprecated as hazirdous and dangerous This lam bound to
3av, was precisely the amount of popu aranxuty for the mea
sure among my constituents which had been brought to my per
sonal notue before I left home to take my seat here Since I
have been here I have received several petitions m favor of the
measuie I rom vai ious poi tions of my constituents, also one Irom
Unci, and one fiom Alton, m Illinois These have all hpen
presented to the ilouse, with the exception of two, whicn I
have hid no opportunity to present since I íeceived them
but they will be pi esented so soon as, by the rules of the House,
they "hall be in older I have alse received and presented to
the House the proceedings of a respectable public meeting in
one of the villages of my county, adopting resolutions in favor
of the measure Thus much I felt bouiad to say, as well thar
those cons itnents as those other friends at a distance who had
made m3 the organ of communicating then wishes to the Ilouse
t light und island that their views had been so presented as to
h ive then due weigh! in the deposition of this question Alto-
eethci, mi, I hav probably presented m these foims the views
of so i m. Out or five hundied of the people of my county—a
c Miníy r w lining about 60,000 people, and casting at election
aboa' 12,000 votes
But this might seem, howevei, an imperfect if not an unfair
representation of the popular opinions of my constituents. I
feel bound, then, to go further, and to express to this committee
wna* I believe would be the opinions of that portion of my
constituents who have not spoken on the question It is
obvious that, they are either not greatly agitated with the sub-
ject or that they have such reliance on our ability to dispose of
it discreetly, that a very great proportion of them have net
thought pioper to importune us on the subject I presume it
lias been with the gieat body of my constituents as it has been
with me—-that, feeling a strong desire that the unfortunate
might be leheved, I had hoped that some measure of the kind
might he so peifertecl as to effect the object in view, and upon
which we could agiee But when I come to examine the pro
lectaubmuted to me, to htudy its details, and to think out its
acmal opei ltton upon the business of the country, I find that
the system I n a genei tl bankrupt law now submitted to us is
li ible to objection which had not before occuired to me
Knowing, a-. I believe I do, th*1 general intelligence and kind
lunitei'Qts-i oí my constituent*, I presume that, on the general
question, t- it had occuued to me—andas I belie/e has only
been c< nsideied by the country—a great maj inty of my con-
stituents, if the question were propounded to them m the gene-
ral foim of ihe petitions before us, would probably express
themselves, in the language of those petitions, in favor of "a
general bankrupt law foi the discharge of unfortunate debtors
who shall surrender all their property, and insuring a just
distribution of the same among then creditors " If then, it be
deemed material to ascertain the popular opinions of the coun
try on this measme, and that of my constituents be deemsd
m aerial, you may < onsidei theus as before you, for our mu
ful consideration in formmgour judgment on this measure I
trust, then, tua no friend of this project, however aidently he
miy have espoused it, will impute to me any design to rmsie
present the will of my constituency
But oí tlit, popular opinions conveyed to this House oithia
itbjp-i t it may be remaiked that therf seemed to be aremaka

peütiow cune to u^ from Utica fiom Onondasa, oi lorn lib

a ciiuiu une that might be regarded in estimating the
«stiencrth of pnblicopmto i in favor of the measure, and whi^h

pub ir npim m ronveved to us one thing fnither may be safely
s\id that, if not artificial and concerted, itv*at> at least, in form
\er> sife and j uiicious Like the opinion m favor ofajudi'
ci )us iirtff it seemed tobe put in such an indefinite form as to
be veiy jeneial v acceptable To such general «pinions it
w uld seem npiou¡s to object; but it is this eenerai opinion
oniy uuon which my constituents or the country have expiessed
themselve-- and I fear, if not the only opinion considered in
committee it will here be allowed tosupei«edeallotheis Other
gentlemen who have addressed you have made strong anpeils
to your sjmpatmes, and described m glowing col rs the scenes
of m isery whn.h wr. law was to relieve The> have even as

Umi le* and dependants, and of the average a nounf of m
come which their productive employment would annually add
to the wealth of society, and, assuming that their present em-
plovments produce almost no'hmg, a contrast, as an aggregate
lesnlt, is very sansiacorily a-r ved at, that woild eeem tQ
stegger ciedulity itself But  he pit tuie drawn, the reasoning
attempted, the | remiees assu ned, and the conclusion airived
at, are otwously but, the productions ot an arden* imagination,
and entirely too exiravagan' to be rel'ed on &*> a saíe guioe m
the grave business of legislation
I shall content myseli with tala lg a more humble view of
this measure, sha'Uxamme its deuuib, an 1 ascertain, if I car,
how fat its provisions are calculated to wo I- well
It is to be observed thit alljmisdiction which you cancón
fei upon uie subject of bankrupted, must, of necessity, te
vested in the couitsof the General Government. By tl „ con
structions which have been put on the Constitution, we cannot
vest any jurisdiction n the courts of a State, m accordance
wirh this constitutional principle, you propo&e wvebt the juut,
dsetion only m the courts of the United atates a d I suppose
yoj cannot do otherwise To the g eat massof the community,
the district or circuit court of th United totales is a distant, a
foreign tribunal, and "cessible, v-ith convenience, onlytotho <
inhabitants of the im nediate vidmty where the terms of'he
court 3t c held or the United states judge resides Tor this rea-
son, then, those living remote fiom the courts would not, as
petitioners, be apt to seek the ielief > ou propose fo afford them,
whde the incoi venience to thoee who=e rights might be ad
veisi'ly affected, and whose interest might lead them to coivtst
the pmceednigs, would be oppressive and intolerable
Acain The" kind nf jurisdiction you piopose to confer on
these courts, as the mode of proceeding Ahichi^to he adopted
to carry thb actinto ejíeet,isio be acct rding to summary pro
«.eedipE-í m pqiuty Phi's mode of administering justice, from
the multiplicity oí resu atio i and the extent to which the pi o
ce.dmgs mxy be spun out and the expense multiplied, is ex
tremely vexatious and opprt1 ¡stave, and of couiee obnoxious to
the citizen Tne weight of this objection may he estimated
from a fact which I wit! relate Not long since, apioject was
started m my own State foi amending the Constitution as to
ihejudiciaiy itappeaied on taking the vo'e that a majority of
the Senate were foi abo'ishmg entirely the couit of chancery
Now, the Senate of that State aie astai I, sober, and considerate
tolyofmen, and should be presumed to íeflectfairly thf well
cc isidere 1 judgmert of the people As members of the couit
fm the t orrecion ofeirors they are associated with the judges
of the Supreme Couit and Chancel'or in revising the decisions
of those tribunals And yeta majouty of that grav body pre
iened to abolish all equity jurisdiction, to having justice ad
mi ustered under forms so dilatory, expensive, and vexatiou1!
Insolvents are discharged in my own State upon then own pe i
ti )H3, with the concu lence of two thirds, m amount of then
cie! tois The appHcatio s aieprescBtedto a judge of a Co irt
of lawat 'li&ehrmbers and the whole pioceedmgs so regulated
by statute as to make them simple as w cl I as certain Bet hew
much of these proceedings in bankruptcy aie presciibedby*
voui statute^ how much aie to be piovided foi by the varying
codes of regulations to be promulgated by the diffeieiitcuur -,
and how much to depend on the customary practice m
equity'1
It needs but slight foieeast to see that your system of bank
ruptcy may be any thing but miifoim In one district the
pid«*e may well construe your statute so as to authorize him on
the application of a creditor, to render a judgment of bankruptcy
upon the pub ¡cation of twenty days' notice, and without the
personal service of any process on the bankrupt This judg
ment is, by meie operation of law, to divest the debtoi of all
his property, and yet is, at the expiration often days, to be
come final and conclusive In c^bc the party resides at a great
distance, (.ext* emely definite language this for a «statutp ) he is
to hive, not a longer time to appeal, or take oi jection to the
proceedings, but is to be allowed to have a change of \ enue arid
a trial in his own neighboihood Thus a snapjudgment, of the
most oppressive character, may, m the language ol this act, be
come final and conclusive at the end of thirty days, without any
peiMii al service of piocess; or any personal notice of the pio-
ceedmgs p,ut in anothei distnct the u tdge, by his special
rules, to be published aa the special laws to carry out the act,
(and which you seem theieby to concede that you have not the
time to make ) or in accordance with ihe practice in equity,
ma> not proceed to tendei judgment until the defendant is made
apatyby due process of law, is allowed to put in his answei
as to a bill in equity, go into proofs, hearings, and reheaunss,
and the trial on feigned losue of contested facts, and the pro
eeei'ings be soun out and delayed, by modes well understood,
oí e-jpudine a suit in equity. If this disciepancy may result
from the difierent modes m which the act may be carried into
effect, in consequence ot this legislation you devolve on the
judges, then the system is not uniform, and the pioceedmgs in
eithei of the cabes stated seem to be liable to great oppression
and abuse
It would seem that Unepds but a slight examination of the
piovisions of the bi'l to see the inconsistency of us piovi&ions.
Hy one section you provide that the debtor may p'ead his dis'
charge in bar of any suit which may be brought against him
for any demand from which he may be discharge! But, by
another provision, the creditor who ¡shall claim a dividend, and
prove his debt for that puipot.", ib precluded Irom maintaining
a suit thpreror, his demand is extinguished as hy a statute bar
to result, fiom his own act ir pioving bis debt The (Jischar^,
wien plead m bai by the debtor, you piovide in anothei phfee
imy be avo ded or impeached for fraud It would seem that
wnoe^crnrew the bill intended that only that class ofcreditojs
wno forbore to prove then debts should be allowed to contest
the di-charge on thp ground of fraud The í .isbbh banku.pt
1 iv- piovides that the demands of ciedifors dnchaiged undei.
the hmkruptcy shall be revived, by proof of tho^e acts which
avoid the dis.ch.ai ge Why legislate m smh. aspire of careless
ntbi) i1 out tb^ tights of creditors, and for the benefit, too, of the
fraudulent bankitipt ¿
Again By one provision of this bill you profess to secure
certain existing lens, but by another piovision the creduoi
havmg «ecut u> by lien, and coming in to } rove his debt is to
relinquish his lien Now takp the common ca e of a creditor
holding a lien by mm gasre or judgment, which lien may he in
fact, but asecunty foi onequaitei oi one half oi other sma'l
pioporti«n of his fMit—a ftt-quent case resiiltm^ from j nm.
liens, an obvious course of ] usure would seem to requiie m
that case, that the cred 'oi should be aPowed to come n a a
creditor at hi *e for the excess of bw debt above the \ alue of e
security W thout '■uch amenhnent, (he rrovisioi toser je
