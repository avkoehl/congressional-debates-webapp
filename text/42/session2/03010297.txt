money paid to the collector previous to the
SOth November. 1870, which do not appear,
for the reason, may be, that the distribution of
moieties had not taken place at that time. It
is important, however, to know all these facts
to reach correct estimates of tlie princely sala-
ries of these officials.
I have obtained from the office of the Com-
missioner of Customs a statement showing that
from the 1st of June. 1870, to the 31st of July,
1871. a period of fourteen months, there was
paid to the collector at New York, in fines,
penalties, and forfeitures, the net sum of
$692,814 11, and that this officer received
from the Treasury, for his moiety, $54,925 05,
as will appear from the subjoined abstract:

There is a marked discrepancy between the
report of the Secretary of the Treasury and this
table for the months of June, July, August,
September, and October of the year 1870. [
mention these as they are the only months in
common in the two statements. That obtained
from the Commissioner of Customs shows,
for the months named, several thousand dol-
lars more than was received by the Collector,
according to the Secretary's report.
From another source,equally entitled to credit,
it appears that the appraised value of the seiz-
ures alone—! mean, of goods actually seized at
theportof New York—were, for the year 1808,
$355,452 93; for 1869, $334.049 08; and for
1870, $210,745 14—in all, $900,245 15. In
passing, it will occur to many, as an interesting
inquiry, how it were possible there should bo
such a vast, difference between the appraised
value of goods seized in New York and the
amount realized on the sale by the collectors of
all the ports before named. As will appear upon
an examination of the report, not more than
$540,808 42 could have been received into the
Treasury from that source, which is but a little
over one half of the appraised value of the
seized goods in New York alone.
I will here give the figures of the Secretary,
of the amounts, as near as may be, paid into
the Treasury by collectors at the various ports,
on account of money accruing, upon seizures
from Jauuary 1, 1868, to November 81, 1870:
Boston $10,532 48
New York   397,392 44
Philadelphia     8,351 67
Baltimore  16,939 09
New Orleans  12,392 62
' 3au Erancisco  94,860 51
It thus appears that the money paid from this
source by the collector of New York for that
entire period was but a trifle over the amount
of the appraised value of the seizures at that
port for one year.
Just here the inquiry is pertinent, what
are the amounts at present received by these
officers ? It is one of the peculiaritiesof the
Bystem that not only is the compensation ex-
cessively large, but so exceedingly indefinite, |
that we must in some measure depend upon
estimates. So complicated is this perquisite
account, with its unsettled cases, pending com-
promises, suits in court, &c., that no abstract
for a definite period gives a correct idea of the
actual interest of these officers, and at ports
where frequent changes have been made the
difficulty of obtaining actual amounts is in-
creased. But there is no doubt that the prin-
cipal officers at the port of New York receive
at least $60,000 per annum-each. It is not
strange, then, that these positions are so desir-
able, that the strife to obtain them should be
earnest—so earnest, passionate, and selfish as
to be injurious to the best interests of the Gov-
ernment, and, in a restricted sense, detrimental
to parties and to administrations. Why should
each of these officials receive a compensation
twice that of the President? Why should each
abstract from the Treasury annually more than
the combined salaries of the Supreme Court
bench ? Why should these three officers re-
ceive more than is paid to the President, his
Cabinet, and the judges of the Supreme Court
combined? These monstrous and exorbitant
sums are paid to officers whose responsibilities
are certainly no greater than those of any one
of the high administrative or judicial officers
I have named. Popular attention has never
been closely directed to this matter, or long
ere this, I am sure, an irresistible cry for re-
form would have overthrown the system and
its abuses, which are every way so demoralizing
and injurious to the officials so greatly over-
paid, pernicious to their subordinates, and,
above all, detrimental to the public interests.
Scandalous as these influences have been in the
immediate past, they may be exceeded in the
future,when, extendingupward as well as down-
ward, the very sources of patronage may become
tainted. The avidity for these lucrative posi-
tions will in time, iflhey have not already, in
evitably engender corruption in their pursuit
and retention ; the vast and ever-increasing
emoluments and the enormous power of pat-
ronage must attract the unprincipled, and every
insidious device and corrupt stratagem will be
employed to secure and enjoy this coveted
wealth and power.
But, to return; it may be urged that as the
responsibility of seizures and suits rests upon
the collector of customs, he must be compen-
sated for the risk. If this were so, it is evident
that the naval officer and surveyor, who do not
share this risk, cannot plead the, necessity for
such protection; but even as regards the col-
lector the plea is specious, as there exists no
record that any such officer ever suffered pecu-
niary loss through such responsibility. The
courts have never refused a certificate of " prob-
able cause," and if they ever should, an over-
zealous officer would find protection in the
sympathies of special legislation. No; it is the
Government that is finally responsible, and it
is a safe position for the official who shares in
the successes, to shift the burden of failures
upon the broad shoulders of the nation.
But there are reasons for the abolition of the
system of moieties which lie deeper in princi-
ple, and affect more seriously the public ser-
vice, than even the matter of colossal perquisites
of a few officials. It gives these officers such
an interest in frauds upon the revenue that
their advantage lies rather in the continued
existence of frauds than in their complete re-
pression. In fact, it is their interest, to a cer-
tain extent, to encourage the infraction of law,
and to treat occasional detection with such a
degree of leniency as will afford the largeot '[
official emolument, without deierrmg others !j
from similar piactices. While it would be j|
temerity to so act as that tacit encouragement ji
of fraud upon the revenue would be at once ji
apparent to the public, the fact nevertheless i'
seems to me well established. _ _
Let us look at the evidence upon this point, ,
as brought out by an examination of the Sec- ;i
retary's report. From the 1st of January, 1868, ,,
to the 31st of November, 1870, there were
detected in the several customs districts ot the
country 2,911 cases of smuggling. In 199 of
these the cases were settled without suit. In
1,833 cases the goods were seized and sold
without suit, and the offender allowed to go
free. In 731. the goods were released and
returned to the smugglers, upon payment of
the appraised value. Fifteen were compro-
mised, and in only 133 were the goods sold
by decree of court, and the offending parties
were not otherwise punished. During the game
period there were 1,484 eases of fraud and
crime, violations of the various sections im-
posing fines, penalties, and punishments, as
found in the laws of 1793, 1799, 1823, and
1866, and for the importation of goods in ille-
gal packages, and undervaluations. Of this
number 1,336 cases were settled without suit;
in 72, the goods were released to the violators
of the law on payment of the value thereof to
the collector; 18 cases of undervaluation, in-
volving the payment of over one hundred thou-
sand dollars, were compromised; and 72 were
disposed of by decree of court. It thus ap-
pears that, out of all the cases of smuggling
and other illegal and fraudulent practices upon
the customs revenue which were detected dur-
ing this period of nearly three years, rising to
the startling number of 4,395, there were only
191 of them which ever went into court, even
for civil prosecution. This leaves 4,204, as
will be seen, which were settled, compromised,
or the goods disposed of by those who had an
immediate interest in the proceeds to be ob-
tained, in one way and another, by reason of
the moieties which they could secure. It seems
to me there can be but one answer to all this,
and that answer must be an unqualified con-
demnation of the system which thus becomes
the nursery of criminal conduct and the pro-
tector of palpable iniquity.
But, advancing another step in the examina-
tion, we are confronted with a still more strik-
ing and alarmingview of thecase. It has been
seen that there were 4,395 instances detected,
m which money has been received by the col-
lectors, and moieties paid to the officials enti-
tled to them, during the period named. Of this
number 2,911 were for smuggling, and 1,484
were for fraudulent practices of various kinds.
I need not say to Senators that smuggling is a
crime, nor that, of the 1,484 cases of illegal
prac'ices, it is safe to assume that over one half
of them were also crimes against the laws of
the land, subject through our criminal courts
to condign punishment. But, let me inquire,
what has been done with them? We have a
right to expect that every one had been pre-
sented to a grand jury for indictment, and put
on trial in a criminal court for the offenses
charged. But no such thing. Of this vast
number, I find there has been only one case
presented to a grand jury, or, at least, but one
indictment found. This happened in New
York, and, upon the facts as revealed in the
report of the Secretary, it presents a case which
again illustrates the evil tendencies of the pres-
ent system. On page 88,1 find that "Dymond
& Sally'' paid to the collector, either in August,
September, or October, (I presume ill the latter
month, though it is not clear in the report,)
the net sum of $38,755 51 under a decree of
court for fraud m undervaluation of goods. On
page 116 of the same repoit will be found a
statement that "John Dymond et al." were
arrested December 18,1869, for bribery of cus-
tom-house officers and passing false invoices,
and that a nol. pros, was entered in the case
July 10, 1870. This was but a short time
before the court decreed that this same firm
should pay the sum before stated to the col-
lector for defrauding the revenue. This is
no doubt the case of Dymond & Lally, (in-
stead of '"Dymond & Sally," as the report has
it,) who were extensively engaged in bribing
officers to make false returns of weights and
appraisements of sugars, involving the integ-
rity of different branches of the customs ser-
