The President therefore directs that you immediately forward all the infantry force that can be spared to Fort Monroe, thence to proceed according to orders to be received on their arrival at that place. It is believed that you can forward 10,000 infantry, and if more can be sent with safety to your command, it is hoped you will do so with your accustomed energy and promptness. No artillery or cavalry are wanted.

Very respectfully,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Captain W. W. McKim, assistant quartermaster, Boston, Mass., will forward above as soon as possible.

A simple summary is, that this army has fought every day for a week against superior numbers, holding its own at least, often repulsing the enemy by day, then retiring at night.

Our losses have been very great, for the fighting has been desperate, and officers and men have behaved heroically.

I am in hopes that the enemy is as completely worn-out as we are. He was certainly very severely punished in the last battle. The roads are
