may be telling the truth. Informant left his brigade at 7.20 p.m., more than an hour before the other passed along the line, finding the corps had moved. Informant came to our pickets about 8 o'clock last night to exchange papers and trade, at which time he had no idea of deserting. In conversation with our pickets, having learned that deserters were well treated, he was induced to remain on this side. Though a deserter, he is a man of considerable intelligence and may think it is dishonorable to disclose such an important movement to the enemy. We forgot to mention that the deserter from the Eighth Alabama Regiment saw the wagon trains of Anderson's old division (Mahone's) harnessed and ready for a move, and the camp of the division hospital broken up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
