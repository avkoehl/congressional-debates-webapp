force upon Nashville through McMinnville. You are, I fear, getting out of position. Get your command at McMinnville without delay and be prepared for any emergency, remembering that your main object is to cover Nashville and the railroad. You may be called on to form a junction with the main body. Put yourself in safe communication with Tullahoma. I have ordered a party to repair the road. Bear in mind that you must not disconnect yourself from the main object of the campaign.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 3, 1862.

Major SIDELL, Nashville:

Send by next train to Captain Crittenden, Fourth United States Cavalry, care Captain Chandler, quartermaster at these headquarters, 30,000 rounds Sharps carbine cartridges. Requisitions by mail. I answered your dispatch about prisoners, to refer their cases to Governor Johnson and act as he suggest. If there are cases which do not properly belong to him act as may seem best.

JAMES B. FRY.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 3, 1862.

General SMITH, Manchester:

Send the Fortieth Indiana to join its brigade and division forthwith. Don't call up any troops to replace those ordered away. In fact I shall probably take away all but a few companies. Make a stockade for one or two companies to guard the bridge when repaired, and in addition make temporary intrenchments for one regiment. Don't lose an hour.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 3, 1862.

General SMITH, Tullahoma:

The enemy under Bragg is said to have crossed at Chattanooga about the 30th in large force. He may design to march against Battle Creek and Dechered or in less force against Nashville via McMinnville. I fear Nelson is getting entirely out of position. I send telegraphic dispatches to him. Forward them by more than one courier with the greatest possible haste. Take every precaution against capture. Send them in cipher if Nelson sent his in cipher.

D. C. BUELL.

TULLAHOMA, August 3, 1862.

Colonel FRY:

A courier from Nelson brings me the information that he has occupied McMinnville and moved still farther forward to-day. This will quiet this whole region of country, and so long as we hold McMinnville there would seem to be no necessity for keeping any considerable force here.
