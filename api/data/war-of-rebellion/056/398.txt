HEADQUARTERS CHIEF OF CAVALRY,DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,

Kingston, Tennessee, December 13, 1863.

Major General JOHN G. PARKE,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Ohio, Knoxville:

GENERAL: Upon my arrival here on the 11th I reported to you by courier. The note sent by Mr. Ellison was forwarded to me by him without seeing or receiving from him verbal instructions to which your note referred.

I have reported by courier from Crossville and this place to Major-General Reynolds, chief of staff, Department of the Cumberland, and await instructions. The want of pontoons over the Tennessee make it difficult to procure forage from the islands by means of flat-boats. Subsistence stores are not to be had here. In the event of my command moving in the direction of Knoxville, is it desirable that my train should haul supplies or be left at or near this place, more convenient to forage?

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. L. ELLIOTT,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, and Chief of Cavalry.
