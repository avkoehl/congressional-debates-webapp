Mr SIMMONS observed that he had a few remarks to
make m answer to what had fallen from the Senator from
Ohio.
Mr PRESTON asked if the whole thing had not been ir-
regular; and inquired what was the question before the
Benate.
The CHAIR explained, that m stuctness the question was.
whether the Senator from Rhode Island should proceed The
Senator from Ohio having gone beyond the'mere explanation
allowed on the introduction of a resolution, without having
been called to order, the Senate could, by general consent, per-
mit the Senator from Rhode Island to proceed
Mr. KING observed thatm all oidmary cases, great latitude
©f debate was allowed, byt there werecasesm which greatln-
convenience might arise When he had voted to take up the
resolution, it was under an expectation that the Senator from
Ohio would have modified a ; and had it been taken up, the
resolutions now offered, and the remarks accompanying them,
would not have been offered But all this having occur-
red, jtseemednow as ifdiscussion could not be íestrained It
Was obvious that&ucb discission could hardly be kept from ex-
citement He would, howevei, suggest to the Senate the obvi-
ous propriety of appioachmg this bubject with calmness and
moderation
Mr CALHOUN observed that his vete against taking up the
original íesolution showed that he had nodesire to seethesub
ject agitated in the Senate, as long as k was pos&ible the affairs
of Rhode Island would be settled by the people themselves, but
it was impossible now to prevent discussion He hoped it
would be permitted to go on, and that the íesolution would be
allowed to be presented, and that a day would be appointed
íbrtakmgit up for debate    He made a motion to that effect
Mr. PREáTON concurred with the Senator from South Car
olmo, [Mr Calhoun,] that the time was come foi discussion
He thought the time had come when it was necessary to lay
down the pi inriples on which the action of this Government is
to be conducted in its relations wi*h the States He there foie
seconded the motion of the Senator from South Caiolmato
have the resolution printed, anda day appointed for its discus
8 ion.
Mr. TALLMADGE had listened to the Senator from Ohio
for some time with surprise—theSenit** having refused to take
«p the original resolution The discussion had been f >rced
«pon the Senate quite irregularly But, as it was permitted
to go so far, he would move that the ^entttoi from Rhode Island
be permitted to go on, and then, if no one else offered such a
motion, he would move to lay theiesolution on the table
Mr ALLEN explained, that wncn he had expeitenced a de-
termination on thepaitof the majority of the Senate to sup
press the expression of opinion on the part of the minority he
had taken advantage of a rule 01 the Senate wh ch ] ustified him
in pursuing the course he did li gentlemen were forced into
discussion, it was the consequence of an arbitiary attempt to
suppress a free expresaior oí opinion, dictated by a sense of
public duty
Heiea general disposition was manifested to allow Mi Sim
"Mons to proceed, and the point of older being withdrawn—
Mr. SIMMONS made his acknowledgments to Sena'ors who
had interposed to obtain him a heaimg in reply to the Senator
from Ohio The remarks of that Senator had not excited in
him any other feelings than those of surprise The Senator
had proceeded on the assumption that all constitutional law
and rule of government should be in writing Whence di 1 he
derive thisnotioni Not from the country of our origin With
respect fo the constitution of Rhode Island, which the Senator
from Ohio chaiactenzed as dead, and all action under it as
blasphemous usurpation, he (Mi te ) would say that it is—no
matter what it may or may not be—the constitution of Rhode
Island, and it was not competent for any othei State to dictate
to that State what its constitution should be He denied that
¿he charter of Us government was such as it had been described
by its opponents The charter fully recognises the form of
aiteiingn The Legislature has frequently acted upo-i that form,
end called convention'' It did so when it called the convention
which ratified the Federal Constitution The people of Rhide
Island knew what they weie about when they adopted that Con
stitution Wheie else weie the elements of civil ano religiou 
liberty to be found which hadalwavsactuated Rhode island but
m that charter—the fust evej obtained m these colonies'* It
was these cherished principles oí liberty which bound it to the
hearts of those who now wished to cherish it I' is contended
that the Legislature is supported by a minority ur the people
This he denied He maintained there was always a majon y
entitled to franchise, as l«r£e a=> in any o'her bta e Rome
regulatioi was neccssaiy with íeeaid to qualifications oí suf-
frage
The people of Rhode I&land, through then Legislature, htd
fixed their own i ules, and no other State 01 powei had any n^ht
to interfere In tho&e rules the State of Rhode Isianl asked
for some particular evidence of the attachment ot a citizen to
their State, and to the di&tnct of hi> íesidence, befire it gianted
the franchise Does not every othei State, in some ioim 01
other, lequne the samel Ihev^aj that, in oidei to give evj
denceof this attachment,thecit zen must purchase a hnme to
the amount of one hundied and Unity f>ur dollars The very
first act of his own life was to vt=a the savings of his mnonty
in the purchase of pioper y to tn'itie bin to thn ngnt It was
property which he piu^d above all others, and vmich would
be the last he should evei pait with This pride srive a ] ecu
liar home feeling and attachment to the people of Rhode I-land
But such i& the regard which the Legislature ha forpopu'ar
righvs that whenever a nuiibor of the people constituting a
majouly have proposed a change it has been ac orded On
the application o! th semen who a vear ago, asked the Legis'a
ture for an extension of right*, ihc Legi&Utuie cabed a conven
tion, al which they htd their request accorded Rot, tnsfeal
of patiently waiting till the change was consummated,  he-e
men got togethei and a tempud to levnlu iomz° the? Go vein
mem, they pit&ented to even body an 1 anybody thtir n«w
constitution, without the «hottest guard asamst fiaud It i 
now the boast of some who signed that constitution, tl it they
did ao aixtet nor eighteen time* Notwithsanuinsc ill thi- the
convention authonzed by the I egisliture went on tule\t<nded
the right of suft rage as far a  had been leqttirtd, b it the oppn
site party voted it down with as much eneigy as if it was to
deprivethem ofmfliage, in teal of f> meie^e it All that the
Govemmentof Rhole Island leqmres is that whatever change
may be defied by a larse portion of the people, may he ef
fected by law and according to law
When the Senator from Ohio was reading t^he declaration of
the people oí Rhode Island with regaid to the sovereign right*
of the people, he (Mr. S ) was m hopes the Senator would have
read further, and shown what wab the sense ol Rhode Island as
to what was due to its Government It says that the powers of
government maybeiesumed by the people when necessary,
and that any power not delegated to ihe General Government
or Congress, remains with the people or their respective L^gis
latares He would ask tho honoiable Senator, wheie was the
power of Congrebs to declare that any fotm of government
shall be the government of Rhode Island'? As to the powers of
the Legislature of that State not being defined by a written con
stitution, he would say they were defined in the bill of rights,
lie would ask the honorable Senator if instead of Rhode Island
being governed byananti tepublican government, it was not
the most republican government in the Umoril for, the people
every six months elect their representative , who are thus
checked by the people tvice as often as the representatives of
any other State The ut>aga of that people, with respect tó many
ol their institution a is as. íepiilmcan as m any country m the
woild But whethei the Government of Rhode Inland deiives
its rights ii om a written constitution or net, he (.Mr. S ) denied
the rKht of this Government to dictate to that State what form
of government it shall hdve He legiettcrt that any disposition
should exist to goad on, by handbfls, oi letters, or other means,
any portion of the people of Rhode Island to butcher then fel-
low citizens He said of t,uch men, when he heard of these
handbills and letters, thaf they had no children—no hearts
He had been unexpectedly called up on the piesent occasion,
and was not prepaicd to do justice to the subject He enume
rated many < f the mos distinguished patriots of Rhode Island,
who had oeen first and foiunost in the struggle for independ-
ent, e, and asked, had not itt>Cíjveinmt.ntbi.eii first and fore-
most on every occasion in evincing a determination to maintain
public liberty? He characterized as a new fangled doctrine that
which asserted that the charter of Government on which Rhode
Island had prospered for two hundred yeais, had been for fifty
years a dead letter, and that all action on it had been blasphe
mous and damnable usurpation He maintained that the prin
ciplefa of that ohartei could not be nnpio\ed upon It was the
pride of a little terntoiy, not more than thirty miles square,
that the principles of its charter for civil and leligious liberty
had become the principles of libeity tmoughout the civilized
V\ orld He Would conclude by sa> tng that, if the Senatoi who-
now decneb this charteL understood it prorerly, he would chei
ish it to his bosom as a tieacuie beyond puce, and value it as
the apple of his eve
Mr CRITTFNUCN a«ked the Senator from Ohio whether
he understood him to--ay that he had uH the Pie<*idtnt of the
United totates thai, he dared not em¡jky the uoop->of ibe Imited
States to put down msuirection aaainot the Government of
Rhode Island 1
Mr ALLÍ N explained, that what he dm --ay was, that he had
told the President ol the United -state , fa"u to f3ce that if be
atiemptpd to employ the army of the United States in pi event
ing, by blood-died, the mass of the citizens of Rhode Island from
establishing a republican constitution and «jvtrnment, he
would be attempting that which tve Ameritan people never
would permit him to effect.
Mr CRITTENDEN observed, that however he might feel
bound to takL the senators owi explanation of what he did
say, he and the Sena'ors aiound him ha 1 understood the Sena
toi as having sta'ed that he told the President of the United
States that he daied not employ the ai my of the United bates
to support the Government of Rhode Island against msuriec
tion
Mr ALLEN observed that he had already herein stated m
suostance, what he had told the Pie-identot the United Mates
If the Senator from Kentucky wanted further inhumation on
that po.nt he could make mquny of thePtesident himself
Mr. CRITTENDEN did not choose to ask the Piesident, he
a«ked the Senatoi him&elf, and since it had come to that, he
would say that the Senator had asserted that he to! 1 thp Pre«
identof the United States, face to face, that he daied i ot, on till 
occasion actually emploj thearTvof the United bta es
Mi SIMMONS at,ked leave to m ike a few temaiksoia
point which did not occ u to him when he w s addressing the
Snnate befoie He ¡hen proceeded, and m de some further
ob-.c¡nations, llios ating that the puncq It-s of awl and ic
hginushherty guarantied in the chai'ei of Rhode Tsline' were
siich as pre eminently entitled that btate to admisión into the

Messrs PRESTON and CRITTFNDEN, from then «eat*,
