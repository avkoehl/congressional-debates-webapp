at Woods' Gap in Taylor's Ridge, and drove them back toward Lee and Gordon's Mills. The enemy then fell back through Gordon's Gap, as reported by General Baird from Ringgold. A scout just from Dalton reports Johnston has been re-enforced by 10,000 men from South Carolina and by Roddey, and he believes he contemplates a forward movement.

CHATTANOOGA, March 5, 1864.

Major General JOHN M. SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

It has been reported to Major-General Thomas to-day, and also two days since, that the enemy were heavily re-enforcing at Dalton. General Grant thinks it is not improbable that he may advance against us here. In that case we shall need the Fourth Corps, and wish you to hold it in readiness to send, if it be needed. Cannot send you any assistance while this contingency is hanging over us.

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Knoxville:

I have just received reliable information that Johnston has been re-enforced by 10,000 men from South Carolina and by Roddey, and that he contemplates making an offensive movement in this direction. Can you spare Granger's corps and the cavalry? If so, please direct them to concentrate at Cleveland, leaving a brigade of infantry and battery at Calhoun to guard the railroad at that place.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
