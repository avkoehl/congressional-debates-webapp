post route bill.
Mr. RAMSEY. The Committee on Post
Offices and Post Roads, to whom were referred
a great number of memorials, resolutions of
States, &c., on the subject of post routes, have
directed me to report them back, and ask to
be discharged from their farther consideration,
inasmuch as a bill on that subject has been
reported.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That order
will be made.
Mr. RAMSEY. And if the Senate will in-
dulge me, I should like to have the post route
bill passed this morning. We shall have to
pass it before we adjourn. It will occupy no
more time than will be consumed in the read-
ing of it. I move that the Senate proceed to
the consideration of that bill.

unanimous consent to consider the bill at the
present time. Is there any objection ?

inquire of the Senator how much time it will

will have to pass.

bill?

to interpose, but it is absolutely necessary that
I should call up an appropriation bill this

then go to the House of Representatives.

been printed and is lying on the table of every
