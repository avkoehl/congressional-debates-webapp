HEADQUARTERS,Fort Crook, Cal., August 13, 1864. *

Lieutenant E. D . WAITE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Sacramento City, Cal.:

LIEUTENANT: Yurs of the 6th instant, inclosing a communication of John R. Ricahrds, is at hand, and in reply I would state relative tot he death of Jacob A. Deals, the following report was brought to me about the last of April: That Deals, meeting an Indian on Round Mountain carrying a rifle, had demanded it, and being refused its delivery commenced shooting at the Indian with his revolver, but missed his mark. The native returned the fire and killed Deals. It was also reported that the Indian was killed by other settlers. This I considered as settling th affair, and that I would not be justified in punishing any other of the tribe for it. The general opinion at the time among the citizens was that Deals provoked the quarrel, and was only served right. I have believed until lately that the report of the death of the Indian was correct, nor am I certain that he yet lives. Relative to the plundering of the house, I have used every effort to ascertain by whom it was perpetrated, but cannot satisfy myself as to the justice of punishing any one tribe, though the best evidence in my possession shows that two indians who had been employed about the place were the culprits, and of whose residence I know nothing. The statement of Richards that I would protect the Indians even when I knew that ehy had committed depresdations against the whites is a led. The conversation which I had with him and the circumstances which gave rise to it are these: Last October Ricahrds, his partner, Kingston, and several citizens residing at Round Mou tain, some forty miles fro this post, made a raid into the Hot Creek country, killing two bucks, fwounding one, and disabling several squaws for having (as they statd) set fire to some fencing and stolen a few potatoes on their ranch, and the only evidence they had of their guilt was the statement of a gang of Indians on their place, with whom they lived.

As soon as I received the news I left for the Hot Creek country to invest, and if possible to prevent the tribe from taking vengeance of other settlers, which many of them were ferful would happen. I sent a runner to their camp toinfoarm the chiefs that I wished to see them. After some little delay, and finding that I was alone, they came in. I was astonished at the good sense they showed in speaking of the affair, saying that they blamed the Indians most who had led about them, and that ehy would not take vengeance of any of the whites, but would hold the tribe resonsible. They claimed that I should protect them when innocent andnot allow the settlers to mkae any more raids into their cuntry. All the evidence shows that they were guiltless of the offense charged. I ten sent forthe man Richards and informed him that I considered his conduct unauthorized and unjustifiable, and if the offense was reeated I would arrest him and all concerned as persons dangerous to the community, jeopardizing the lives and peoperty of other settlers by their reckless conduct. I also informed him that I considered it my duty not only to protect citizens from Indians, but to see that the natives were justly dealt with. His statement that the lives and peoperty of citizens in this valley are in danger is false. Since the fort was established there has at no time been such general quiet and good feeling as at present, and the only trouble for the past year can be dierectly traced to the aacts of lawless white men, and none have been nmore broublesome than the complainant.
