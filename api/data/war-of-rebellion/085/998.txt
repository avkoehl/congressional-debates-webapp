Colonel CRUMP,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

COLONEL: I am instructed by Major-General Magruder to say that you will attack the enemy at Mount Elba if on this side of the river, and if he should have progressed toward Warren you will get in his rear and rout him. Should the enemy's cavalry pass down to Monticello to attack Harrison you will communicate with Colonel Harrison, cross the river at Mount Elba, and attack the enemy in rear. There are supplies at Warren. McNeill has probably fallen back the four miles mentioned by him on the Warren road, though he does not state which road he has taken. When you arrive at Mount Elba guard well the roads above and below in that vicinity. The regiments proceeding toward Warren you will order to continue in that direction until they have met and secured all the sick and trains on that route coming from Monticello, to this place, not excepting those on the other side of Comish's Ferry over the Saline River near Warren. If the sick have not been crossed over there are some boats at McDade's Ferry which can be poled or moved up to Comish's Ferry and used to cross them over.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ED. P. TURNER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
