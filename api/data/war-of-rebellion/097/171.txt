the division he so handsomely commanded yesterday. I consider the retaking of Fort Sumter under the circumstances a meritorious service that should be promptly acknowledged.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 26, 1865-10.45 a. m. (Sent 11.30 a. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANTz:

All has been quiet since 8 p. m. last evening. Wright and Humphryes hold and have entrenched all the advanced line captured yesterday as far as the Armstrong house, which includes all but a small portion on the extreme left near Hatcher's Run, which there was no military advantage in retaining. Humphreys now estimate his casualties at 700, Wright at 400, which will make our total casualties from all parts of the line about 2,000. Deserters report the fighting very severe and the result as having a depressing and demoralizing effect on their army.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 26, 1865-4 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I would suggest a modification of your instructions of the 24th instant, viz: Instead of placing Ord's command on the two roads used by Warren and Humphreys, let ord mass o the Halifax road in rear of our works, and when Humphryes moves out on the Vaughan road let Ord move to the crossing of Hatcher's Run by this road and await developments. This will keep up communication with Wright and will cover my supply trains, which I shall order to park at the crossing of Hatcher's Run by the stage road, the one Warren takes. There are so few roads and the country so little open I do not deem it advisable to bring these trains nearer until we either move from Dinwiddie Court-House or have exhausted our four days' supplies. I propose also to have Humphryes' pickets from Hatchers' Run to Wright's left to be relieved by Ord, unless you direct otherwise. Do you wish any of the cavalry left on picket on our rear line, or shall Davies take it all? Collis has some 300 cavalry that might be sent ot Parke and a small regiment left with Wright to watch the roads coming form the south and keep off guerrillas and scouts. Let me know your views on these points at your earliest convenience.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., March 26, 1865. (Received 9.25 p. m.)

Major-General MEADE:

I have telegraphed to the Secretary of War asking to have orders published announcing. Humphreys and Parke as the commanders of their respective corps; also asked to have Hartranft brevetted. Will probably receive answer in the morning.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
