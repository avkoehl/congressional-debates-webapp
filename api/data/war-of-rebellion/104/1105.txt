Cot. T. M. VINCENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Stoneman has instructions to muster out of service all regiments of white volunteers except the First Minnesota Heavy Artillery, and the Twelfth Ohio Cavalry, the Tenth Michigan Cavalry, the Eighth Michigan Cavalry, and the Sixth Indiana Cavalry. As one cavalry regiment is of more service now than four regiments of infantry, I have thought it best to retain the above-named regiments until further orders. If the people continue quiet and peaceable until Congress convenes all the white troops remaining in this department at that time can be dispensed with.

You may, therefore, withdraw all the railroad guards and concentrate the regiments at the most convenient points for keeping a check on the conduct of the people. I recommend a central point between this and Johnsonville for one regiment, Johnsonville for another, Columbus and Franklin for another, Murfreesborough for another, one cavalry regiment at Pulaski, another cavalry regiment at McMinnville and Lebanon, another in West Tennessee. The Third U. S. Colored Cavalry and all the colored infantry and artillery now at Memphis to remain and the other regiments white cavalry in East Tennessee, and distribute the remainder of your negro regiments to the chief towns in the State not above mentioned. The quartermaster's department have the Fifteenth and Twentieth here guarding public property. They had better remain, as they now know what is expected of them and are becoming reliable.
