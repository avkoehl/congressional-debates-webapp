MILLEDGEVILLE, April 23, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER:

I will respond as promptly as possible to your requisition for two regiments of infantry. Can only tender them organized according to the laws of Georgia. Could send forward some companies very soon. I propose that each company march as soon as ready by way of Augusta, where you will be expected to have an officer to muster each into service as it passes and before it leaves the State, with the understanding that each ten companies when they arrive at Richmond be permitted to elect field officers and organize into a regiment. In this way the troops can arrive there with greater dispatch from if required to rendezvous and form into regiments and be mustered in as regiments before leaving Georgia. If this is agreeable I will direct railroad companies in Georgia to send bills to you for transportation of companies, and you will please make arrangements beyond Augusta. Answer immediately, as I wish to know how to shape my orders.

Governor JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville, Ga.:

Your proposition is entirely agreeable. Let me know when you will be ready.

L. P. WALKER.

MILLEDGEVILLE, April 23, 1861.

Hon. L. P. WALKER:

To whom shall the companies report to be mustered into service at Augusta? They are in different parts of the State, and cannot all go forward for a few days. Some of them will start in a day or two. Will try to have tents, knapsacks, and accouterments for them all. Will want some muskets from Augusta Arsenal. Please direct Major Cumming, now there, to furnish them. Answer.

JOSEPH E. BROWN.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., April 23, 1861.

Governor JOSEPH E. BROWN,

Milledgeville:

Captain Cole is ordered to Augusta to muster in the troops. Major Cumming is ordered to supply your requisition for muskets. I hope, however, that you will make it as light as possible.

Governor MAGOFFIN,

Frankfort, Ky.:

If you received my disay requesting you to furnish a regiment I shall be obliged to know your answer. *
