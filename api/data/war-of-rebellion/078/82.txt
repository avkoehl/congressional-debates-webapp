HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Acworth, June 6, 1864. (Received 8th.)

Major-General WASHBURN, Memphis:

I understand that the command started June 1 from Memphis for Tupelo, &amp;c. Does Sturgis command? It should be a Light, movable column, not too strong. It need not exceed 6,000 men, as I know all of Polk's troops are with Johnston, and Forrest is on his way here. I have ordered A. J. Smith to gather up 10,000 men, and make a strong demonstration in connection with the navy on Mobile.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
