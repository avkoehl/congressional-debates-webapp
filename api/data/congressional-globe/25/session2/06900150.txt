first place, if not actually piolnbited by the Consti-
tution, it is evident it would have been done
had its framers foreseen that an attempt would
be made to establish it as the regular medium oi
receipt for the public dues We find whole masses
oí the Constitution directed by them against the
paper system, and we well know that it was a thing
of which bitter experience had made them heartily
sick, that they were, in the memoiable language ot
a gentleman on the other side, hard money mtn
In the second place, no prudent person ought to
receive what he cannot with propriety pay out, md
it was well i rged by the Senitoi fiom Massachu-
setts [Mr Wibstfb] on another occasion, that the
Government ought only to pay, or even oiler to
pay, us creditors m a sound, uniform medium, so
that the actual amount paid to each creditor
should be equal to the nominal amount due him
In this I heartily ccncui, and theieiore think the
commanding the receipt by levenue ofheers in pay-
ment of public dues of what cannot be considered
as such a medium, highly impioper Money is the
only medium in which the law should authon/e or
compel the receipt of debts, and especially public
debts, and it is an abuse ot teims to call bank notes
money Tiny want tht mam iharactcrisiit ol

And does not this consult ration ol itself, so lar (h m
furnishing a reason why Gu\cnmimt should fix
its stamp upon bank notes, < pcrate itirootly the
( ihel way? In declaring that to be money which
is not money, Government gives currency to a
falsehood, and unsettles the uiund found itions 11

should they noil "Why should f<u ore I associations
be taken under the fostenn„ caic f the Govern-
ment, and individuals, whose worth and ability
may be more distil ctly known, ducanled ftim it'
Is this in keeping with the treat pimeiple-! of
equality upon winch our institutions are base il If
assistance to the poor, in whose behalf the Senator
from Massachusetts who las a Uresscd you [Mi
Davis] spoke so pathetically, were a legitimate ob-
ject of the action of this Government it would cer-
tainly be much better accomplished by us endors-
ing the notes of the poor and needy, but worthy
and struggling, citizen, than tho'e of these wealthy
coi porations
But the system pioposed by the substitute is a
radical change in the whole action of our Govern-
ment fiom that pioposed by the Constitution. In
the first place, it legislates into perpetual existence
a cuncncv unknown to the Constitution, and
against which many of its provisions are directed.
In the next, it introduces into the textvue of the Go-
vernment a fourth estate, never designed by its fra-
mers to enter into it It m effect declares that our
ignorant forefathers knew nothing of the dire cor-
iupturn which pervades the human heart, or had
overlooked the only means oi providing against it
That un y did not see the beauties of that bank ma-
thuieiy by wInch the public treasure might be se-
cured against the fingers of the pilfeier, and ne-
glected to piovide it And it is now proposed by
their mtue sagacious sons to supply by legislation
tins dangeious omission If all tins is Hue, shall
we sutl a that sacred instalment to be thus Inter-
pol itcd without a regular pioctss of amendment—
that the legislature shall thus alter what was
iiamed ior the expiess purpose of cticumscnbmg
its own action'' Suiely not But it is not true
that the framers oi the Constitution vt ere ignoiant
oi this bank agency, but it seems had it dnvtinctly
bt lure them and delibeiafiv lepudiatcd it
13m, notwithstanding all this, the Opposition calls
the linii puitUnl Ticastuy a novelty—an expen-
ini nt That is 11 sav, that the only plan known
t(i tin lust 5 000 years of the existence of the
woi'd, is. a novelty, although it has been,with very
iew exceptions, continued evei since, while that
which was uevei heard of until about seven hun-
dred vt lis aso and did not receive any thing like
tin foim in which it is now urged until alittlcmore
than out hundred yeais since, is a perfect antiqui-

ties of the Government, had secured to it a larger

e ame into existente Government necessities we

the Governmentob'ained for the banks the authority
t i make these disguised exactions fiom the people
Yet gentlemen say that banking is not profitable,
and r<-irr to tht small dividends of the United States
15ink They leave out of the calculation the
anreurits p ud to Government for their monopoly,
the lussi s by frauds and mismanagement up to
I'M1), and tne contingent fund for promoting the
spied of baik pimciples These are the institu-
tions which claim the merit of antiquity, and look
dow n upon that as a novelty, which, beginning with
the history of mankind, has existed m its native
simplicity to this day.
Again, it is argued that the collection and
disbursement of the revenue in gold and silver
aie altogether impracticable, without ci eating
great public distress through the scarcity of
those ameles And here I will frankly confess,
that when I first bogan to consider this subject, I
was apprehensive that the adoption of the Indepen-
dent Treasury system would materially affect the
pi ice of property, reducing it to a distressingly low
value, and that has been, in my view, the only un-
favorable circumstance connected with it But longer
observation and deeper leflection has dissipated that
feai, and I now feel confident that the depression
m the value of property, produced by the ptesent
leaction, is far greater than that which would be
more permanently produced by any probable check
given to the paper system by this or any other mea-
sure within the reach of Congress, or, indeed, by
the total suppression of bank paper I will call
your attention to a report furnished by the Secre-
tary of the Treasury at the present session, show-
ing the balances m the Treasury at the end of each
y eat, by which it is, in my judgment, manifest that
live millions of dollars are enough for the Treasury
circulation, and with the reduction in the revenue,
which I hope to see take place, three millions will
be amply sufficient. Mr Gallatin computed the
precious metals in the world (in 1819 1 think it
was) at between four and five thousand millions;
and after all allowances each way, supposed the
annual increase to be equal to about one per cent,
which, by this time, would bring it up to between
five and wx thousand millions Ot this about
tw o thousand five hundred millions exists m com.
But oui calculations are not to be circumsctibed
within the two thousand five hundred millions, the
whole amount of the five or six thousand millions
belonging to the great family ol nations, for
that pin pose lor which the God of nature seems
especially to have provided them, and when-
ever the com is found deficient, the bullion
existing in other forms will, by an irres «tibie
law, come as offeirngs to the altai of public conve-
nience, whether it is found in the embellishments
of modern life, or the curious vases dug from the
mins of antiquity The circulating medium of the
world may be compared to avast ocean, of which
the peculiar portion of each nation is connected with
it, like a bay or arm of the sea Each is affected
by its tides, receives of its fullness at iU flood,
and must pour back into it at its ebb From this
ocean all that we would want foi the purposes
of our Treasury, would be bnt as a bucket-full
irom the waters of the Potomac.
It is next urged agunst the Independent Trea-
suiy that it is m facta Government bank "If
this were so, it were a grievous fault," and many
of its present friends, could they be so persuaded,
w onld at once abandon it But assertion is not
proof, and after all the ingenious efforts of the Op-
position to make goo I this charge, they have as I
think, signally failed The most pi uisible of all the
untenable arguments to which thev have resorted
to support tlnschuge is, that the bill authorizes
a liansfer, by draft, if necessary, of the funds,
of the Government from one part of the coun-
try to another , and this they say constitutes a bank.
If this be so, then almost every man m the country
is not only a banker, but a bank For who is
there who may not, by bill of exchange, tiansfer
money which he may hav e in one part of the
country where he does not want it, to another
where he docs But this objection of a Govern-
ment bank comes with peculiarly ill grace from
the Opposition, for however we may beat around
the subject, the sting of a Government bank lies at
last in its power to furnish a circulating medium
to make loans and pay dividends These are the
alvers by which public opinion is to be moved,
end all these the substitute in effect proposes to
give to a system of institutions connected with the
Government, while, whatever may be said to the
contrary, the Independent Treasury wants them
all, and no human ingenuity can lay its iingei on,
the clause ol the bill m which either of them lies
If gentlemen choose to suspect covert purposes not
appearing on the face of the bill, there is no rea-
