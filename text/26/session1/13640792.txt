APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 1840.
S6TH Co)CG—«l9T Sess.
Independent Treasury—Mr. Merrick.
Senate.
Labor is higher in England than in the hard-
money countries of the continent; yet she competes
with and triumphs over all of them in the markets
of the world ! But the wages uf labor are low
enough there, in all conscience,though much higher
there than on the continent of Europe. Mr. Presi-
dent, as it has been urged in support of this bill
that one of its good effects will be to reduce the
■wages of labor in this counfry—mechanical, man-
ufacturing, agricultural, and all others, of course—
I have considered it material and important to in-
quire to what extent this reduction was to take
place. These wages, we are told, must come down
to the specie standard; and we have been referred
to Germany and llolland, and other European
countries, as examples of hard money currencies,
and the cheapening effects of such currencies upon
wages. Now, sir, as I wish the people to be in-
formed on this subject, as well as ourselves, I have
been at the pains to hunt up some documentary evi-
dence of the rates of wages in those countries, and
will read them to the Senate, that the American
people may see to what they are to be reduced, and
make up their minds whether they are willing to
submit to such rates, for the sake merely of a hard-
money currency. Here are tables of the rates of
wages in those countries, which I will read, taken
from " Porter's Progress of the Nation."
" In November, 1833, instructions were sent by
the British Secretary of Stale, Lord Palmerston, to
certain British consuls residing abroad, requiring
answers to certain questions having reference to
the «tate of agriculture, and to the condition of the
agricultural peasantry within the districts of their
consulates. Answers received from the consuls in
various parts of France, Germany, the Netherlands,
and Italy, have lately been presented to Parliament;
and from the*e documents the following abstract is
taken:

Now, sir, I am greatly in hopes our people will
read and ponder over this table; they will there see
that in France yearly wages for an able-bodied man
range from 48 to 250 shillings, and day laborers
get in lhat country from 4i to 15 pence per day;
and whenever they get as much as 5 pence, they
have to find themselves. In Germany wages are
still lower, and range by the year between 53 and
100 shillings, and day laborers receive from 4* to
7 pence per day, and find themselves in food. In
South Holland farm hands get by the year from
200 to 250 shillings, and day laborers from 3 to 4
pence per day, and are found,   And so on, sir.
"Whoever will take the trouble to examine the table,
which is official and autfientic, will see that, in all
these countries, -which are held up to us as such
bright examples of hard money countries—France,
Germany, Netherlands, Italy—wages by the year for
an able bodied, sound, healthy man,nowhere exceed
250 shillings; and, in many instances, fall as low
as 40, 50, and 60 shillings; and the daily wages
range from 3 to 'J and 12 pence—rising in one place,
and only one, to 20 pence, and the laborer finding
himself! What a commentary upon the hard-money
policy! What hope is here for a man born the son
of poor parents ever to better his condition 1 What
ray of hope is there to stimulate him to exertion1?
None, none! He who is there born a peasant, dies
a peasant. Those born to the plough die at the
plough-tail; and all lhat the longest life of labori-
ous toil can procure for them is coarse and scanty
means of subsistence. Think you, sir, these peo-
ple are made happy because theirs are hard money
countries'? Is this the prosperity boasted of when
■we are triumphantly told of the immense amounts
of gold and silver held by their great capitalists 1
Is this an example worthy of our imitation 1 Think
you, sir, the high blood of American freemen will
submit to this 1   Never.
The honorable Senator from Pennsylvania, (Mr.
Buchanan,) in the eloquent speech with which he
favored us the other day in support of this bill, ex-
ultingly told us the people of the country were for
it. He spoke of its former defeat in Congress, and
of the triumphs of his party in several of the recent
elections, as giving proof that the yeomanry of the
land had declared in favor of it, and were com-
mending the wisdom and patriotism of its projec-
tors. Sir, the Senator in his exultation reminded
me of a story I once read about a council of mice,
which, with his permission, I will tell. There was
once a colony of mice, who would have lived very
happily but for the annoyance of a mischievous
cat, who was very apt to pounce upon and feast
herself with some of their dainty flesh, whenever
they ventured to go abroad (or expand, as we arenow
occasionally inconvenienced by expansions of cur-
rency.) These mice called a council to consider
of and devise the means more effectually to protect
their community from the annoyances of the cat.
After the assembly was duly organized, and many
wise and grave suggestions"had been made by dif-
ferent members, to all of which there had appeared
some decisive objection, up rose a smart, sharp-
witted little mouse, much distinguished for cunning
and management, and holding, I suppose, about
the same rank in the esteem and regard of his fel-
lows, as is held in our community by a certain little
gentleman at the other end of the avenue, desig-
nated yesterday by the Senator from Pennsylva-
nia (Mr. Buchanan) as the little Magician. All
eyes were immediately turned upon him, and every
ear was attentive to hear his suggestions ; for many
supposed he never uttered any thing but upon " so-
ber second thought," and all knew his skill at con-
trivances. Pleasure was beaming in his counte-
nance, and confidence sat upon his brow, as he
announced that he had discovered a remedy for the
evils they suffered, which was both simple and ef-
fectual; so simple, that the wonder was it had never
been thought of before; for it seemed to be pointed
ont by their very conslittiiion and the nature of
things. It was, that they should resolve and decree
that this infamous cat should ever thereafter wear
a bell about her neck; which, being so worn, must
of necessity give the alarm whenever she attempt-
ed to move or approach their dominions, and thus
afford every one full opportunity to provide for his
safety by a timely retreat. The suggestion s-ruck
"the whole assembly with great force; they burst
forth in rapturous applauses of the talents, patriot-
ism, and profound wisdom of the little author; and
it was promptly proposed to pass a unanimous vote
of thanks in his favor. Just before this vote was
taken, however, an old mouse, long retired from
the cares of state, bat experienced in the wars with
grimalkin, observed, with great diffidence, that not-
withstanding the remedy proposed seemed to be
very efficacious, and possiblv would afford to the
community (after it should be applied) complete
protection, yet there appeared to him to be a small
difficulty in applying it, namely, the risk of being
devoured by the cat while they were fixing the bell
upon her; and he could not consent to pass the
vote of thanks asproposed,unless the member would
also show how this difficulty was to be surmount-
ed. The little gentleman was struck dumb by these
remarks; and refusing to attempt to put the bell on
himself, upon the ground that he was a counsellor
and not an operative, the assembly forthwith, far
from passing the vote of thanks, expelled him from
the council, and denounced him as unworthy not
only of confidence and respect, but deserving of
universal execration, for recommending a measure
pregnant with imminent peril and mischief in its
execution to his fellow citizens generally, and from
the evils of which he screened himself by vittue of
his station. Such, sir, will be the reverse of for-
tune with the authors of this measure. They had
the confidence of the country. The measure has
seemed to find favor with the people, and gentle-
men may now flatter themselves with some indica-
tions given in the late elections of the passage of a
vote of thanks by the people in their favor. But
when you attempt to bell the cat; when the people
shall see and feel that they are to be crushed and
destroyed by the execution of your plan; when they
find themselves impoverished, the prices of all
kinds of property and products of industry reduced
to almost nothing, and realize in practice the very,
very low prices of labor, as I have shown them to
be in the non-credit-using, hard money countries;
and see, too, that from all these evils the authors of
the measure are themselves protected by being sal-
aried officers, with salaries payable in gold and
silver; they will not only refuse the vote of thanks
you now hope for, but I am much mistaken if they do
not visit upon authors, aiders, and abettors of the
whole scheme such decisive marks of displeasure
as will cause them bitterly to repent that it was
ever suggested.
Sir, the body of the people of this country have
been much amused, for some years past, with the
praises of hard money, and eulogies upon the con-
dition of those countries where coin is the exclu-
sive circulating medium; and they have been se-
duced into the opinion, especially the laboring peo-
ple, that they were to receive, if the policy of the
measure now under consideration were carried
out, the same amount in payment for their labor or
productions, in silver and gold, as they have usu-
ally received in convertible bank notes. Bat they
have not yet considered or understood that they
were to receive, in place of one dollar or more per
day for their wages, but four pence or nine pence
in coin. They have not reflected upon the im-
mense tax this change was to levy upon the pro-
ductive industry of the country, for the sole and
exclusive benefit of the money-holders and salaried
officers I Are gentlemen blind enough to imagine
they can persuade any considerable part of the in-
telligent people of America to believe that when
one of them has a five dollar bank bill in his
pocket, received as wages for as many days' work,
which bill he knows he can convert into silver or
gold if he pleases, and which, whether converted
or not, will purchase for him an equal amount of
any thing his wants or convenience may require,
that it would be belter for him to have received for
his same five days' work some twenty, thirty, forty,
or even one hundred pence in coin 1 It is possible
such opinions may obtain amongst those who wish
to acquire money for the purpose of hoarding
merely, and whose greatest delight consists in
counting and turning over bits of coin; but they
will never be entertained by those who know the
real value and appropriate uses of money; who
desire to earn and acquire it only for the Purpose
of paying their debts, or of exchanging it for those
things which contribute really to the comfort, hap-
piness, and well-being of themselves or of those
that are dear to them. What difference does it
make to a man who owes five or a hundred dollars,
whether he pays his debt with a bank note or with
gold and silver 1 None. But it makes a vast dif-
ference to him if forced to pay in gold and silver
only; and he is obliged, in consequence, to give
five or six times the amount of labor or property to
procure this gold and silver.
But, it is urged this change is necessary; this
reduction of prices here is required to enable our
manufacturers to compete with those of Europe,
and thereby prevent the balance of trade against
us, which is periodically dmining our country of
the precious metals, and causing suspensions of
specie payments and the like. In my humble judg-
ment, sir, the unfavorable balance of trade against
us is to be attributed to another and a very differ-
ent cause. It is properly and justly assignable to
our unwise commercial regulations. It is because
we permit European countries to supply our mar-
kets with their surplus productions, whilst they ex-
clude many of ours from their markets.   "We in -
