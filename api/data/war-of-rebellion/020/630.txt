(Received at Richmond, October 8, 1862.)

SECRETARY OF WAR:

If the return of the Florida regiments will interfere at all injuriously to the army under General Lee let them remain with him. My application was basses upon information that they were prostrated from sickness incident to the climate; not efficient where they are. We need forces here and on side of Apalachicola River, and if they shall come from Georgia and Alabama these States will be thus defended.

Governor of Florida.
