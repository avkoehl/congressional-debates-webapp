Major-General WHEELER:

GENERAL: General Johnston informs you that he will continue to hold the river by infantry from Green's Ferry to Howell's Ferry-that is, by detached brigades in advance of the line. He wishes you to connect with this line of detached brigades on your left, and then to observe as high up the river as practicable, particularly in front of any force that has crossed or may cross. Keep the reserve artillery if you need it; if not, send it back to the main line.

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.
