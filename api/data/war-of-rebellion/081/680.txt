Lieutenant Colonel W. H. TAYLOR:

The Sixtieth Alabama Regiment has been doing provost duty in Richmond. Pemberton's battalion is a part of the heavy artillery force under Lieutenant-Colonel Pemberton. Owing to the weakness of the forces under General G. W. C. Lee, the Sixtieth Alabama and the battalion were ordered to report to him, and were placed by General Lee at New Market Hill. The orders of General Bragg to General Ewell directing force to be sent to General Hampton have been counter-manded.
