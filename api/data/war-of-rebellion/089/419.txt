HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 28, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER:

The One hundred and sixteenth U. S. Colored Troops are the only troops which have yet reported to me; they number 300 men. The Two hundred and sixth Pennsylvania Volunteers, numbering 500 men, is, I believe, on the way up. No men have yet come up to garrison the redoubt beyond Four-Mile Church. Should men for this garrison arrive, I shall take out nearly 8,000 infantry even if I have no other re-enforcements.

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 28, 1864 - 6.15 a. m.

Lieutenant SHREVE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

There has been no change in the extent of my line since yesterday. No troops of the Eighteenth Corps have come to relieve us and to enable us to shorten our line. About an hour after dark it was reported by an officer from that corps that the division was about five miles from the Charles City road, and at that time had not started. That is the last word we have of the troops who were to relieve the right of our line.

Very respectfully,

A. AMES,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully forwarded for the information of the major-general commanding.

General Ames' line is very attenuated, too much so for safety, and yet I do not feel authorized to direct him to contract it toward his left without authority from General Butler.

A. H. TERRY,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,October 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General AMES,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: The major-general directs me to say that your last dispatch was forwarded to General Butler, who replies that General Weitzel could not see to move last night, but will move this morning.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

WM. P. SHREVE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
