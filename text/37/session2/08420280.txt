Bankrupt Law—Mr. Ward.
Ho. of Reps.
who comprehend arfrue and enlarged commercial
polity. The passage of that act was preceded by
an extraordinary financial panic, resulting in gen-
eral insolvency, the causes of which 1 have briefly
.traced already. There was no relief for these
bankrupts except through the passage of such a
law. It was urged upon exaggerated grounds, as
to the number of the insolvents and the amount
of their indebtedness, and formed a part of the
series of financial measures of the party then in
power. Under a great pressure, it was passed.
It was objectionable in some respects; in these
particularsitcould have been afterwards amended;
but in its main features it would have operated
beneficially. As soon as the voluntary applicants,
who were 33,739 in number, with an aggregate
indebtedness of $440,934,615 01, were relieved,
or in the process of relief, the law was repealed—
just when, through the involuntary clause, it
would have become serviceable to the cieditoi—
contributed largely to prevent future panic, and
exercised a wholesome influence upon trade and
commerce. The error was not in the passage of
the act of 1841, but in its early repeal before it had
received a fair trial.
Another prominent argument against affording
relief to the unfortunate but honest debtor who
has become the victim of casualties which, per-
haps, as in the case of our present war, the states-
men and Government of our country were unable
to prevent or foresee, i? founded upon the fact that
the assets of those who became bankrupt under
the law of 1841 yielded only a small percentage
to their creditors. Merely a moment's reflection
would bo sufficient to make it plain to any man
that the losses then brought Within the reach of
statistical research were the accumulated losses
of many previous years, created under the oper-
ation of laws like those now existing, when, as
now, there was no general law of bankruptcy. No
such enormous aggregate of hopeless debt could
have been accumulated under a permanent bank-
rupt law. In almost every case the creditor would
have compelled an equitable distribution of the
estate of the insolvent before itwas lost by delay,
or the debtor would have availed himself of the
prospects opened to every honest man by just en-
actments before his assets had been so fully con-
sumed orsquandered. These losses were incurred
under a legal system permitting preferential as-
signments, and thus encouraging unjust conceal-
ments. Under a proper system the creditor would
not be restrained by threats from enforcing his
claims, but would compel bankruptcy and obtain
a dividend before the estate could be conccaled
by fraud or dissipated in the maintenance of the
despairing and entrammeled debtor.
It should also be borne in mind that a large por-
tion of the liabilities of bankrupts in 1841 was
created in the purchase of unimproved property,
partly paid for in cash, and the remainder secured
by bond and mortgage. After the panic the mort-
gagor failing to meet the principal, the real estate
was sold, and bought in by the mortgagee, at, in
man y cases, less than the amount of the mortgage;
thus securing his cash payment, and finally the
whole property. The bankrupt act did not dis-
turb prior liens. Again, the assets were put up
at auction by the general assignee, in many cases;
without an investigation as to their value, and
were bought up by some friend of the bankrupt,
who had more accurate information as to them.
Sir, reckless speculators will continue to en-
counter risks whatever may be the statutes, but
the history of the world assures us that the most
flagrant speculations have occurred where insolv-
ent debtors were treated as criminals. "We are yet
without experience to guide us as to the compar-
ative percentage paid under the present system,
and the amount that would be paid under a just,
stringent, and permanent law of bankruptcy; but
it is worthy of note, that while under the insol-
vent laws of England, which release the body but
do not discharge the debt, few dividends are made,
a dividend isalmostalways made under the bank-
rupt law which encourages integrity, by permit-
ting the debtor to have brighter prospects for the
future, by releasing him alike from prison and
the debt—giving him no hope of prosperity but
through perfeethonesty,yetallowinghim through
this course of conduct a relief, complete and per-
manent. Such laws present all possible motives
for honesty, and powerful incentives to abstain
from fraud.
Sir, it seems to be a just view of the case, m
accordance with the opinions usually entertained
by business men, that the parties to commercial
transactions, where credit is given, are, to a cer-
tain extent, adventurers in common. For fraud
or dishonesty, the guilty should be punished—
but in sales on credit, the risk is borne by each
party, although not in equal proportions. The
vendor inquires closely as to the pecuniary means
of the purchaser, his habits of life, his knowledge
of business, and his adaptation to its pursuits.
He calculates the chances of his customer's suc-
cess, by inquiries as to the competition he will ex-
perience, his practice of selling on time or credit,
and by information from all possible sources. In
this case he maybe regarded as an insurer of his
own debts, and generally chargcs his debtor a
higher price upon credit than for cash. In those
eases where misfortune and not his own crime has
overwhelmed the debtor, he should, upon surren-
der of his effects, meet with an honorable dis-
charge.
Mr. Chairman, various systems of insolvency
regulating the relationsof debtor and creditor pr%
vail in different States. Special enactments for
this purpose are necessary in every commercial
community. In some cases his present assets are
distributed, and he obtains no release from the
debt—his future acquisitions being deemed also
the property of his creditors. In others the per-
son of the debtor is discharged, and he is free to
acquire property in future, if a specified propor-
tion of his creditors vote in his favor. In yet
other cases he is discharged if his assets pay a
ccrtain percentage of his debts, and the consent
of his creditors is not essential to his release.
Insolvent laws, of which any debtor, whether
imprisoned or not, may have the benefit, exist in
California, Michigan, Ohio, Indiana, Louisiana,
Missouri, Connecticut, New York, Massachu-
setts, and Rhode Island. Those persons who are
imprisoned on civil process are alone entitled to
relief in Delaware, Maryland, Tennessee, North
Carolina,South Carolina,Georgia, Alabama, Mis-
sissippi, Illinois, and New Jersey. In Maine,
New Hampshire, Kentucky, and Virginia, the
relief is confined to debtors charged in execution.
In California, Michigan, and Massachusetts,
statutes provide for the discharge of the insolvent
from the debt itself, if his assets are assigned and
distributed among his creditors, while in many
other States his person only is excepted. In the
State of New York the insolvent laws enable the
debtor, with the consent of "two thirdsin value"
of his creditors, and on the due surrender and dis-
closure of his property, to be discharged from all
his debts contracted within the State, with certain
exceptions.
For commercial purposes the different States are
aunit. At present their laws do not extend beyond
the limits of the separate States, and the persons
subject to their separate jurisdiction. In this va-
ried legislation of the different States we find a
valid reason for comprehensive enactments. Alaw
which will embrace the whole Union in its pro-
visions has now become indispensable. Nothing
less can relieve our insolvent citizens from the
heavy pecuniary obligations which oppress their
energies, blight their future, and deprive the coun-
try of the benefit of their services and industry.
The aggregate number of failures durjng several
years, and the amount of the indebtedness, con-
sidering only those cases in each of which the
debts amount to §5,000 or more, and leaving out
the numerous class of insolvents who owe less, is
estimated as follows:
Failures. Liabilities.
1857   4.933 S291.750.000
1858   4,225 95;749,668
1859   3,913 64.394,000
186 0  3,676 79;807,845
186 1  6,993 207,210,427
Total:, 23,739 $738,911,934
Many of these liabilities have been discharged
by voluntary compromise, but this condition of
our commercial affairs clearly requires the inter-
vention of Congress, and this honorable body will
fail in the discharge of an important duty if it does
not perform its share in affording proper relief.
Upon this subject some differences of.opinion
exist between the commercial rfhd agricultural in-
terests—the former urging a bankrupt law, and the
latter inclining to oppose it. I see no good ground
for opposition. Both parties would, I think, be
satisfied with such an act, as in its voluntary pro-
vision, should apply to all persons, butin its com-
pulsory clauses only refer to those who are mer-
chants using the trade of merchandise, all retailers
of merchandise, bankers, factors, brokers, under-
takers, and insurers. The agricultural interests
would not be injuriously affected by such an act.
It seems to me that we can meet upon this sub-
ject in a spirit of harmony, and, without the im-
aginary rivalry of different interests, adopt some
suitable measure that will do justice to that class
of our citizens in whose behalf I now appeal to
this honorable body.
Society itself has at all times an interest in the
subsequent life and exertions of the bankrupt.
The hope or expectation of future acquisition by
conducing to the industry,honesty,and morality
of the unfortunate debtor contributes to the wel-
fare of the community. A due regard for the pub-
lic good demands that the future acquisitions of
the debtor who has faithfully surrendered all he
owned for the benefit of his creditors, should be
placed under his own control, and fully justifies
prudent and careful enactments for that purpose.
