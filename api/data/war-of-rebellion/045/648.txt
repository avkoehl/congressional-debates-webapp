HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 11, 1863-3 p. m.

Commanding Officer Fifth Corps:

Advance your line of battle to near the position now occupied by your skirmishers, and make your skirmish line connect with General Sedgwick's, on the Antietam Creek. Then push forward to reconnoiter between the creek and Sharpsburg pike, and drive the enemy toward Funkstown, till he is found in superior force.

It is not the intention that you should support this force further than to assist its return, if pressed. The Third Corps will be moved up to the rear of your line. Similar reconnaissances will be made by the Sixth Corps on the opposite side of the Antietam, and by the Second Corps on the Sharpsburg pike.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 11, 1863-3 p. m.

General SEDGWICK:

From news derived from the cavalry, there does not seem to be any enemy on your side of the Antietam.

You will push forward sufficient force to ascertain the truth of this, in your front, and take possession of the bridges below Funkstown.

General Sykes is going to make a strong reconnaissance toward Funkstown.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, and Chief of Staff.

General Sykes will reconnoiter between this road and the Antietam Creek. General Sedgwick is also feeling the enemy on the other side.
