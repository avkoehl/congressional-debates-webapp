RALEIGH, April 29, 1865.

Major-General SHERMAN:

General Johnston informs me that the greater portion of his cavalry have gone off and that he has not been able to stop them. I do not see that I can do anything about it until we have disposed of the troops that remain. The cavalry seems to be going south.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, C. S. Army,

Greensborough, N. C.:

When will you be ready to turn over the arms and other public property at Greensborough? I propose to send up a regiment of infantry with the staff officers to-morrow to guard the property turned over. If this meets with your views please inform me. I will send up this evening my approval of the supplemental terms, with some modifications, which I deem necessary.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

GREENSBOROUGH, April 29, 1865.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Raleigh:

I reported by telegraph yesterday that we are ready for the printed forms. I have ordered the arms to be sent to Greensborough, where we have ordnance officers and a sufficient guard. The arms turned in will be as safe under that guard as your own. I hope, therefore, that your troops will not be brought up yet. We are ready for your staff officers. Our troops are a good deal dispersed to procure forage.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
