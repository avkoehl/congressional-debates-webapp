movements of our own forces as well as of the enemy. He also directs that the Sixty-first Illinois Infantry be ready to move in an hour, with five days' rations. You will not have any rations cooked until you receive further instructions. Have 40 rounds ammunition in cartridge-boxes and 60 rounds per man in reserve.

COLONEL: The general commanding directs that if the cavalry detachment ordered to follow Captain Snelling has not moved, it will not do so until 6 a. m. to-morrow. It will then proceed as directed until it communicates with Captain Snelling, or with Colonel Ryan, Third Arkansas Cavalry, who is falling back from Lewisburg.

Lieutenant Colonel JAMES STUART,Commanding Cavalry Detachment:

COLONEL: I find it necessary to place Major Lovejoyu, Third Arkansas Cavalry, in command of his own men and yours for the scout to-morrow morning, as he is thoroughly familiar with the country. Please hold your mounted men, therefore, subject to Major Lovejoy's orders. He wishes you to loan him some rations on his provision return; be good enough to do so.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

MAY 18, 1864.

Colonel P. CLAYTON,

Pine Bluff:

I am told that it is difficult to cross artillery and wagons over the river at your post. Perhaps there is some better way of bringing up what was ordered this morning. I want the Eighteenth Illinois Infantry, Fifth Ohio Battery, and as much of Haine's train and supplies as you or not need, to be brought here in the safest and most expeditious manner. Please give me your views at once. There are two steam-boats here which can be used. Perhaps the artillery and part of the train can be brought here by boat, and part of the train and regiment can come safely by land in one day, on the south side of the river.

E. A. CARR,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
