described in the annexed proclamation of the Governor of California, on the 7th of February last, calling out troops in the counties of Humboldt, Mendocion, &amp;c. * Under such conditions I think we could raise volunteers rapidly in this country. I have not yet seen an official copy of the recent conscription act. I should doubt douth the policy of raising troops by conscription in this country for service against Indians. I have ordered one company from Fort Steilacoom hither. The company from Fort Hoskins has arrived. Twenty men were sent to hold the latter post from Fort Yamhill, as also twenty men to the Siletz blockhouse. These arrangements were made in compliance with the desision of the general as announced in your letter of the 20th of February.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., Apri. 15, 1863.

ASSISTANT ADJUTATN-GENERAL,

Headquarters Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

COLONEL: In view of the want of more troops in this district, I write to inquire if the general commanding the department will object to the officers recruiting for the additional companies of Oregon cavalry being sent by the Governor of Oregon to San Francisco to attempt to raise some recruits in that city. I learn that such steps are frequently taken at the East. I have no doubt the Governor of Oregon will address a letter to the Governor of California on the subject, throwing himself on the courtesy of the latter officer in such proceedings.

I have the honor to be, respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vanocuver, Washt. Ter., April 15, 1863.

His Excellency A. S. GIBBS,

Governor of Oregon, Portland, Oreg.:

GOVERNOR: I write respectfully to suggest that you write to the Governor of California, Governor Leland Stanford, stating that you desire to raise more volunteers and that you will be glad to send recruiting officers into California for that purpose, and that your trust such a course would not be objected to by His Excellency. I think he would have no objections. This course is frequently taken at the East. If one of your recruiting officers was sent to San Francisco he might meet with decided success. If only one company was raised there it would be very desirable. Also, you might authorize Lieutenant Hand to have a recruiting rendezvous opened at Yreka.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. ALVORD,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding District.
