146             ___                  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.______________January 21,
reuse a select committee on this subject He was
willing to vote foi a resolution sending the same
inquiries to the Committee on Revolutionary
Claims, inasmuch as he doubted whether that
committee was fanly in possession of the whole
subject embiaced in the present resolution. He
referred to the practices resorted to by specula-
tors, in order to defraud honest claimants of their
rights, and was willing to aid in pieventing those
fraudulent practices He was, however, opposed
to raising a special committee, and preferred that
the subject should be sent to the Committee on
Revolutionary Claims He concluded by moving
to lay the resolution on the table, but withdrew
the motion at the request of
Mr BAYLIES, who remarked that as a mem-
ber of the Committee on Revolutionary Claims, he
did not view the resolution as a reflection upon the
committee to which he belonged He íeferred to
the objects contemplated by the lesolution, and
remarked that the Committee on Revolutionary
Claims were anxious to place this subject on a
footing to avoid, as far a-s possible, special legis
lation—to produce, m íegard to it, something like
principle and uniformity of action He could see
no good reason for adopting the resolution
Mr MASON, of Virginia, considered the pro-
posed inquiry in some degree distinct from the
regular and ordinary duties of the Committee on
Revolutionary Claims It was known that the
most profligate frauds had been committed, not
only upon the Government, but upon individual
claimants At the last session he had offered a
resolution calling for a list of persons entitled to
commutation pay Upon a consultation with the
Third Auditor of the Treasury, he was apprized
of the most profligate fraud-  which had been com-
mitted by speculatois, and informed that it had
been deemed expedient, in ordei,if possible, to
prevent their recurrence, to withhold infoimauon
touching these claims, except to those duectly
or indirectly interested In consequence of this
interview, he withdrew his resolution The object
of the present resolution was to raise a committee
to devise the means, if possible, to protect the
claims of the heirs of those who achieved our lib-
erties, and to prevent the perpetration of frauds,
not only against the Government, but against the
meritorious claimants, to which reference had been
made. If the obpct could be attained by a refer-
ence of the subject to the standing committee of
the House, be hoped his friend from Tennessee
[Mr. Forester] would withdraw his motion for
a select committee, and let the subject go to the
former
Mr. TORESTER referred to the duties of
the Committee on Revolutionai y Pensions The
object winch he had in view went further than the
ordinary business confided to that committee It
proposed to investigate the whole subject, for the
purpose of pieventing speculatois from seizing
upon the bounty of the Government, which had
been extended to the heirs of those who had
fought the battles of the Revolution fie intended
no reflection upon the standing committee by his
motion.
Mr F referred to the fraudulent practices
which existed on this subject As things now
stood, it was impossible for claimants to piocure
information which they could undeistand, while
the hungry speculator makes himself acquainted
with them He wished to guard against all this.
He wished to prevent these speculations upon the
honest earnings of the ancestois of his constit-
uents.
Mr MILLER, was opposed to the resolution,
because the first branch of it withdiew from the
Committee on Revolutionary Claims a subject
properly before that committee He alluded to
the commutation bill, which was made the special
order for some future day If this resolution was
passed, it would commit the whole subject to this
special committee, which he thought wholly un-
necessary
Mr MUHLENBERG remarked that he was
not in his seat during a portion of the time in
which the motion had been discussed He believed
the gentleman would accomplish his object when
the general bill on the subject came up, which
opened the whole question
Mr REED refeired to the frauds and specula-
tions which had taken place in reference to this
subject, and  he thought the proposed inquiry
entirely proper
Mr. GRENNELL was in favor of the resolu-
tion Its object was patriotic and humane He
was in favor of a select committee, because the
inquiry extended beyond the scope of the ordinal y
duties ot the Committee on Revolutionary Claims
Mr TURRILL had heaid no good reasons as
signed for the adoption of the resolution He
considered the whole subject already before the
Committee on Revolutionary Claims
Mr. EWING wished to mgiafta small amend-
ment upon thf> resolniion He desired to give
those who were rejoicing on account of the com
plete redemption ot the public debt, real ground
for rejoicing, by making provision for the redemp-
tion of the continental paper money. After a few
additional remarks,
Mr E moved the following amendment to the
motion
1 Also to inquire into the expediency of pio-
' vidmg for the redemption of continental paper
' yet lemaining unpaid, accoiding to the principles
' of equity and ms'ice "
Mi FOSTER said, as only fifteen minutes
íemained of the time allotted to resolutions and
reports, he would move to postpone the resolution
for another week, in order that the committee
might have an opportunity to make report.
Mr FORESTERhadno objection to postponing
the lesolution to the 30ih instant, which would be
beyond the time allotted for the disposition of the
bill to which reference had been made.
Mr FOSTER accepted the suggestion as a
modification of his motion
The resolution was then postponed to the 30th
instant, and, on motion of Mi BEATTY,ordeied
to be punted
INDIAN ANNUITIES.
Mi POLK, from the Committee of Ways and
Means, reported a bill making appropriations for
Indian annuities, and other similar ob]ects, for
1835, which was read twice and committed
CHAIRMAN   OF   COMMITTEE ON FOREIGN
constituted the official chairman, the person next
named was also ipso fartn coust^eieti a? chairman__
it would be seen, he said, that thi¡> u-age had been
departed from. Fiom ihesi itementof lhe gentle-
man fiom New York, it appeared that the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations had thought pioper
to elect a chauman of then own, and thereby dis-
place the chau man appointed by the Speakei If
this had happened with íespect to one the least
important of the committees of the House, Mi
A would still have thought the procedure one
worthy of notice, but occurring as i' had in one
of the most important of the committees, consist
ing, or supposed to consist, of persons of the
highest charactei, and owing the deepest respon-
sibility to the House and to the nation—ard its
chairman also, a person under the heaviestrespon-
sibility, he consideied it his duty to bring the
matter before the House
The CHAIR inamated tnatthe debatehad gone
on thus far by the indulgence of the House, with-
out any motion having been made, but if it were
the pleasuie of the House, the gentleman might
proceed     [Cues of " Go on '"  "Goon1"]
Mr ADAMS resumed He was stating that
certain events had taken place which called for the
senousconsideration of the House, and that he was
under some embarrassment as to the mode and
manner in which he should bring it under its
notice In order, howevei,to make the debate
proper, and within the rules of order, it was his
intention to conclude by a motion or resolution,
the purpoi t of which he would state to be to place
the name of the cha rman of the Committee on
Foreign Relations on the Journals of the House
The mam point, however, upon which he wished
to direct the attention of the House was this, that
there was a chau man of one of its most import-
ant and responsible committees acting, without
the House knowing anything about it This, to
say the least of it, uasanncongiuous proceeding,
as well as out of the usual form It should oe
upon the Journals, since, if it was desired to know
who composed any committee, or who was its
chairman, they offeied the only record, and to
them would any one íefei for ascertaining the
fact If it should turn out that the committee m
question had elected a new chairman, for he would
not dispute the word of the gentleman fiom New
York, why, at least it ought to be entered upon
the Journals, so that every member of that House,
and every one in the nation, m'ght know it Now
in ordei to found some few observations he in-
tended to make in this case, as the gentleman from
New Yorkjiad told them he was the cha.rman of
the committee, Mr A begged leave to put another
question to the gentleman, which he mightanbwer
or not as he pleased—it was whether the gentle-
man was elected chairman by a majority of that
committee, or by a minority?
Mr CAMBRELENG said that,before answer-
ing the inquiry of the gentleman from Massachu-
setts, he must apologize to the Speaker for having
answered the first question of that gentleman.
Not having heard the whole of his remarks, he
was not awaie that the inquiry was addressed to
the Speaker, had he so understood him, he certainly
¡should not have risen atall Hemerely heard the
question, and stated the fact for the information
of the gentleman He sincerely regretted that
thegentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Everett]
and himsef should have been placed in so awkward
an attitude before the House However he had
differed with that gentleman politically, he had
ever been on friendly, if not on intimate, terms
with him In accepting the station assigned him
by the committee, he had supposed that the
gentleman from Massachusetts would be relieved
from a position not agreeable to himself at this
particulai crisis The gentleman from Vugima,
[Mr Archer,] the former chairman of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Affairs, had not, at th's session,
doubtless from motives of propriety, desired to
continue in that station in the present peculiar
state of our foreign relations Witn regard to the
particular inquiry put to him by the gentleman
from Massachusetts, he had merely to say that the
vote of the committee stood four to three—the
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Everett]
and himself not voting.
Mr. J a ADAMS   The gentleman from New
York has answered with perfect candor, and from
AFFAIRS.
Mr J CI ADAMS said he was desirous of
addressing a question to the chairman of the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations, and he wished to
inquire of the Chair who was the chairman of that
committee
Mr CAMBRELENG stated, in answer to the
inquiry of thegentleman fiom Massachusetts, that
the committee had done him the honoi to elect
him their chau man
Mr J Q,. ADAMS said he apprehended the
gentleman's reply would be found to haveinvolved
something like the introduction of a new principle
into that House, in the part taken by that com-
mittee Mr A had felt some degree of embai-
lassment as to the manner in which this subject
should be introduced to the House, but upon giving
it the deepest reflection he had thought it best to
apply to the Chair, because the usual authonty
fiom which he could learn who were the chairmen
of the various standing and select committees of
the House were the Journals of the House, and
they weie under the care of the Presiding Officer
Now, it was one of the rules of the House that
all standing committees should be appointed at the
commencement of every session, and another rule
was, thatthey should beappomted by the Speaker
lie was unaware of any lule of the House by
which the Speaker named the chairmen of the
several committees but by usage, which had
become almost universal, the peison first named
upon each standing or select committee was con-
sidered as appointed by the Speakei ex officio the
chairman of that committee, although a committee
had power to elect its chairman, if they thought
proper As far, however, as he (Mr A ) was
acquainted with th  piactice of that House and its
committees, the power of electing the chairmen of
the latter had never been exercised—or, if ever, it
was believed only upon rare and extraordinary
occasions. From what had been stated by the
gentleman fiom New York, [Mr Cambrelentg,]
it would be seen that this old and general usage,
of considering the person first named on the com-
mittee as its ex officio chairman, until another had
tbeen duly elected by the committee—and that in
the event of the resignation of the person thus
