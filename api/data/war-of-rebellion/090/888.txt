Captain FARIS,

It is reported McNeill is preparing for a raid into the Glades. Be on the alert. Give Godwin notice to be active and not suffer himself to be caught off his guard.

Captain PETRIE,

Hancock:

What information did you get from Averell's scouts? Where have they been? Did they come through Martinsburg? What did they learn of the rebels?

Brevet Major-General.

HANCOCK, August 22, 1864.

General KELLEY:

General Averell's scouts came from Martinsburg to Bath; found country all clear; they say no rebels heard of near. General Averell is in Martinsburg. I think the road all safe and sound in this quarter. They say heavy firing was heard in direction of Point of Rocks yesterday. Shall we move up to Back Creek or North Mountain? Answer immediately.

P. B. PETRIE,

Captain.

CUMBERLAND, August 22, 1864.

Captain PETRIE,

Hancock:

I think you had better not run down to North Mountain yet. You might send a small squad on hand-car, if you think best, and communicate with General Averell if he is in Martinsburg.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.
