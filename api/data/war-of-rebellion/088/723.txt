HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,Smith House, September 6, 1864-9.30 p. m.

Captain W. P. WILSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Second Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that in compliance with circular of this p. m. from headquarters Second Corps I have moved my division to the left of the Jerusalem plank road, with my right resting upon that road. The left of the line assigned my be that circular is occupied by a brigade of the Second Division, which is to move out at daylight. From the plank road to the right beyond the Williams house, the lane which I left, is now vacant, the Ninth Corps not having moved in. I have room for three batteries on my line. Two have reported to me. When the Second Division moves out in the morning I shall be able, by forming my division in one rank, to fill the line of works assigned to me. Possibly one brigade may be able to form two ranks, but I do not expect it.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

NELSON A. MILES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Numbers 67. September 6, 1864.

The undersigned assumes command of the division.

T. A. SMYTH,

Colonel First Delaware Veteran Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,September 6, 1864.

Brigadier General R. DE TROBRIAND,

Commanding First Brigade:

GENERAL: The brigadier-general commanding directs that you will proceed as we talked of this a. m. I would suggest that one regiment be put where the Second Division vacated. It will be necessary to put a small regiment, or about 200 men, in the fort for a garrison. The tents should be covered with brush, so that in case of a sudden move it will not be noticed by the enemy so readily.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. LOCKWOOD,

Lieutenant and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
