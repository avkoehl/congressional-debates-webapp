COLONEL: Nothing unusual has occurred along my front during the past twenty-four hours. The enemy opened a very brisk fire from their mortars about 7 o'clock last evening. Two deserters said that it was a salute, either in honor of a victory near Chaffin's farm, or on account of the favorable result of a test vote which had been held in the army for the Presidential candidates. About 8 o'clock a sharp artillery and musketry fire sprang up in front of the two brigades on my right.
