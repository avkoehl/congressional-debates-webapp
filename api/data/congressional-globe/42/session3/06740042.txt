Errors in Mr. Roosevelt's
statement-
Mr. Roosevelt in his state
meat puts the estimated
cost of contract No. 232}
at $83,284 56. The fact is
the estimated cost of this
contract (see report, page
15,) is $101,076 70, an5 the
excess of the actual over
the estimated cost is only
86,306 29, and not #24,-
016 74, as Mr. Roosevelt
states it.
See supplementary report,
appendix to Roport No.
7, House of Representa-
tives. Forty-Second Con-
gress, third session.
Mr. Roosevelt omits from
his statement the esti-
mate of $21,964 50 for con
tract No. 76, on page 7
of report, and in this case
tho estimated cost is
$711 40 in excess of the
actual cost, instead of
being, as Mr. Roosevelt
states 'it, #21,253 10 less
than the actual oost.
Mr. Roosevelt incorrectly
states the estimated cost
of this contract at $52,-
844, while the estimated
cost is given in roport.
page 20, at $62,984 60.
llonce the actual cost ex-
ceeds the estimated cost
$40,515 59, and not $44,-
555 59, as 'Mr. Roosevelt
states it.
The honorable member, growing somewhat
facetious, says as follows:
"The skill of these gentlemen in manipulating
figures does not seem tu be equal_ to their skill in
managing the public property in this District. There
is still a discrepancy of §94,000, which is nowhere
accounted for or explained, and nowhere is there, a
reference to the Tiber creek sewer from Pennsylva-
nia a,venue to Indiana avenue, which cannot bo
much less than one thousand feet in length. Tho
board forget such trivialities as $97,000. In strewing
millions about as freely as they do, a hundred thou-
sand or so would readily slip away 'untalked of
and unseen.' "
Here, with happy facility, the gentleman
mingles the poet's lie-cense with the poet's
fancy. On the list of contracts No. 122, in
speaking of Tiber sewer, it is stated, Novem-
ber 23, "extended from north side of Penn-
sylvania avenue to Indiana avenue," and on
page 14, supplemental appendix, 2,473 lineal
feet of Tiber sewer at .$102 50 are carried
out at $253,482 50. The gentleman's own
tabulated statement also gives the above in-
formation as to extension, which he gets
from the reported figures; and yet he gravely
informs this honorable body that " nowhere
is there a reference to the Tiber creek sewer,
from Pennsylvania avenue to Indiana avenue!"
I call attention to page 9, report of the
Committee for the District of .Columbia, No.
72 second session Forty-Second Congress,
where the opinion of the committee 13 given
directly upon this question of the Tiber sewer.
But yielding the discrepancy 011 the whole six-
teen contracts as shown by the table, (C,) which
