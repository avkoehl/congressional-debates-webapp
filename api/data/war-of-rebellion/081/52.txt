BRIDGE, June 15, 1864-1.50 p.m.

General WILLIAMS:

Some supply trains have arrived, but most of them contain subsistence stores to be issued on this side to-night. The Second Corps train is here, of 107 wagons. They will be ready to cross the minute the bridge is done. The others will doubtless follow without delay. The draw is being closed, and the trains are ordered to cross at once.
