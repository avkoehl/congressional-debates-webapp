General HOKE,

Rockfish Creek:

To delay Sherman, should he move toward Wilmington, it will be well for you to have both Manchester and Charlotte roads cut, and bridges and trestles destroyed at every point. All enemy's prisoners will probably have passed here by tomorrow. You must then be prepared for Schofield's movements. Have roads reconnoitered and repaired from your present position and from Warsaw to Fayetteville.

Lieutenant Fairly reports a bluff, called Black Rock, twenty-eight miles above Wilmington, which General Whiting considered it practicable to blow into the river, thus obstructing the channel. General Bragg desires you will look to this and have it done if practicable.
