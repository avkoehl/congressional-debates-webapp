CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
of the General Government. If the fourth instal-
ment can only be paid by committing a palpable
violation of the Constitution, or by a disregard of
principle, which viould endanger the safety and
welfare of the S'ate«, as well as of the Geneial
Government, such a contract would be void by the
well settled piules of law, as well as by the ac-
knowledged principles of justice
In the couise of this debate it was said by my
colleague on my right (Mr Poster) that postponing
the fourth instalment will operate more nrjuitously
upon the State of New York than on many oí the
othei States. I have grsat reason to doubt the
correctness of this conclusion, but I should under-
value the patriotism of the people of my State if
I supposed they wouki not cheerfully submit to
inconvenience under such an emergency I know
my own constituents too well to believe that they
will expect their lepiesentative on this floor to
vote for a mea>ute fraught with so much dangei.
On the 31st day 01 Jul} last, a circulai was
issued by the Comptroller of the State of New
Yoik, stating that he had made arrangements to
borrow money fioin the Ene and Champlam Canal
fund to supply any deficiency that might exist in
case ol the non-payment of the fourth instalment,
and that the holders of certificates—all of whom
had executed mortgages for the full amount—
might rely on leceivmg their money on the hist
Tuesdij m Octobei Of course the people of that
State will not be disappointed in lecer. mg their
money according to their ceitificates.
But my colleague proceeded to say that the Stite
bank-, who have a portion of this Erie and Cham-
plain Canal fund on deposite would be lequned
to furnish the requisite kinds Asm then \aults,
and mus', oí course, call upon their dehtois and
curtail their discounts to that amount, and thus
pioduce senous embaí raiment This cannot be
the case to anv great extent, for more than nme-
ten'hs ol the money lortowedby the people on

fiom the bank, the bonouer obtains from the State
a credit ol at least one or two 5ears, and that poi-
tion boirouid fioin the canal fund will not be

Tie a< l, J\I, 01111111-11,10 which he prooa-
bly reieis, wa pi «el in the spnng of 1834,
during the fnmotis prr e whe'i the honoialh
genfeimn cannot yet hive forgotten At a time
when the e\piung agonies of the late United States
Bank convulsed me bu me=s woild fo us \eiy
entre; v hen that powciful institution was at-
tempting to extort fien ti e rears of the pub [0,
what the calm  deliberation  of the Amei can peo-
ple had denied it—its rechartei, when panic speeches
Mere made on this llooi, and echoed thiough the
bank-bought piesscs of the oountn, wnea doubt
and dismay were pictuted upon the countenances
of a laige portion of the community It was then,
sir, that the capab'e and efficient Chief Magistrate
of New York, m a special message, submitted to
theLegislanue the project alluded to, and that body
passed the law by an unusually large majoi ity, not
m the space of a few Inurs—piomptly I admit—but
after due deliberation and reflection
By that law the Slate interposed its ciedit as a
shield between the United States Bank and the peo-
ple. Its object vv as to rest le confidence, and that
object was fully attuned by it, without the necessi-
ty for borrowing 01 loan 11  out a single dollai by
virtue of its piovis ons I think -the honorable
gentleman cannot have forgotten thai éms law en-
countered the most bitter opposition from the poli-
tical paity to which he belongs. It was ci'led by
that paity "Marcy's Moitgage," and the people
were told by the opposition puss, that tneir faims
vveie mortgaged to the amount of six millions oi
dolíais But, su, it was astnseless and unavail-
ing clamor—vox et pretcrea nihil, foi in about six
months after the enact ng of that law, Go\ernor
Marcy was re-elected to the evecutive chan, by a
majority of nearly thirteen thousand votes
So far as the act itfcncd to operates as a prece-
dent, it is igamot the position assumed by those who
oppose this bill It shows that the povvei of bor-
lowmg money to loan out to the people, may be
piopeilv i vcrcised by the States It does not show
that that ppvvtr has been confeired on the General
Government
I am happy to peicive, su, that the old and
stale cry of "non-committalism" is now abandon-
ed by that paity which the gentleman fiom Ohio
lepresents, but before he chaiges upon our dis-
tinguished Chief Mag siia*e a id his supp iteis m
his nitive State, th it tne 1 nn isia^s jie too bold
md decided, he ought to have examine 1 >nto the
effect of those ineasuies 111 that State He would
have found tha1 it was undei the influences ol the
party composed of the President's political fi lends,
that the lcsources of that State have ben develop-
ed—that her tmesis have become cultivated fields,
and hei villages have grown into cities—tint her
gieat woiks of internal impiovemenf have been
projected and constinoted—that htr bankm0, insti-
tutions have been regulated and restucted, and the
safety fund system adopted, alfoidmg moie ample

Mr SMITH here interposed, and said he nad

He said he himself had no personal wish on the
mattci  of the rising of the   committee, but had
made the motion fiom the expressed wish of   « e-
ral members
Mi CAMBRELENG hoped the committee
would not rise at that hour, at all events
The motion, however, prevailed, and the com
mittee rose and reported.
The SPEAKER laid before the House a report
from the Secietary of the Treasury, of the amount
of appropirations and expendituies for the curient
year, which, on motion of Mi BRIGGS, was laid
on the table, and 01 tiered ¡0 be printed.

K ptofessed himself not altogethei in favoi of

great interest involved, made it rather incumbent
on them, m his opinion, to postpone the whole sub-
ject until an opportunity cou'd be had to com-
mune with then constituents, and learn their wishes
upon the relative merits of theantagomslquesüon¿
The deposite system had nev ei been a favoi ite ol
