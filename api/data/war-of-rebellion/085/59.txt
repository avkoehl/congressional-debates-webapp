SEDALIA, September 4, 1864

Captain STEGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

The reason of my not following up was simply because I could not secure the co-operation of Lieutenant Stephens, commander of the scouts. I had no authority to take command unless we got in a fight. In that case I was to assume the responsibility. This was private. However, I will send a complete report this evening.*
