HDQRS. DEPT. OF WESTERN VA. AND EAST TENN.,Crter's Depot, Tenn., September 30, 1863.

His Excellency President DAVIS, Richmond:

I have ordered General Ransom forward with a sufficient force, I think, to drove the enemy's rear guard beyond Greensville, and if practicable beyond Bull's Gap. I shall return to Dublin, as accounts I have from the Kanawha I think make it desirable. I have heard nothing from General Bragg.

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.
