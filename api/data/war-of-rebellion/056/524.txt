LA GRANGE,

December 28, 1863.

Major COON,

Mount Pleasant:

Move on the train of the enemy until you are certain they have crossed the Tallahatchie. A column will leave here this morning for Hudsonville. Mizner's brigade will leave about 1 o'clock.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

LA FAYETTE,

December 28, 1863-12.30 a. m.

Brigadier-General GRIERSON,

La Grange:

I have just received word from Major Burgh, commanding cavalry, that the enemy is in strong force between his position, 4 miles from here west and Collierville, and that it is their intention to attack Collierville at daylight, while Chalmers and Lee strike Germantown at the same time. I have concluded, therefore, to march for Collierville at 3 a. m.

Respectfully,&amp;c.,

WM. H. MORGAN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.

LA GRANGE,

December 28, 1863.

Colonel W. H. MORGAN:

Move after Major Coon as far as the Coldwater at Hudsonville. Your battery will join you at that point, also your mounted men and private horses.

B. H. GRIERSON,

Brigadier-General.

COLLIERVILLE, December 28, 1863.

Brigadier-General GRIERSON:

I arrived here about 8 a. m. Forrest left his camp about a mile west of here at daylight this morning, going in the direction of Quinn's Mill. General Hurlbut has ordered that my battery be sent forward as soon as possible and that I follow Forrest as soon as it arrives. Will you please order it forwarded with an escort?

WM. H. MORGAN,

Colonel, Commanding.

[Indorsement.]

The above dispatch from Colonel Morgan is, I think, erroneous in some particulars. Forrest was not west, but east of here, and I do not think he went to Quinn's Mill, but to Mount Pleasant. Of this, however, I would not be positive. It is certain he moved south on
