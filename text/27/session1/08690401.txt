Fiscal Bank—Mr. Ingersoll.
H. of Reps.
SPEECH OF MR. INGERSOLL ,
Or PENNSYLVANIA,
In the House of Hepresentahves, August 5, 1841—
On the Fiscal Bank bill.
Mr. INGERSOLL said he proposed to take up
the subject where the chairman reporting the bill
[Mr Sergeant] began with it. As early as
1781, a Philadelphia merchant, Robert Morris,
suggested to the Congress of the Confederation a
National Bank, which, with their consent, was
soon after established, and called the Bank of
North America, founded on the gold and silver
brought to this country to pay the French army
When the present Constitution was organized, the
first President invited Mr. Morns to take charge of
the Treasury Department. He declined, and sug-
gested to Gen Washington that his aid de camp—
a young man with whom it is said the General
was not at that time on terms of personal inter-
course—was well qualified for that difficult and
important office Colonel Hamilton, appointed
Secretary, in a shoit tim  reported to Congress
what became the first Batik of the United States,
by charier, dated the 25 h of February, 1791
To render comprehensible what little I am about
to say, I lay my few premises of statement
distinctly Remember, then, fits', that this Bank
involved no question of money or properly, as all
modern banks do, with embarrassing and alarming
considerations. Money then was gold and silver,
There was no such thing as inconvertible paper
That modern nuisance was unknown
Mr   BaRNELt,    Will the gentleman give me
leave to ask him a question'
Mr Iwgersoll    Certainly, I shall be glad to be
asked any question';
Mr Bornell    Do I understand him to say that
inconvertible paper was unknown at that time?
Mr. Inqersoll     Law's Bank and other similar
irregularities are matters of familiar history    But
what I mein to assert, and  that empha' callj, is,
that Hamilton  or any one e'se, then, never con-
templated as money any thing but com, or instantly
convertible   paper      I    have  brought  with me,
for proof of this, should it be questioned, his Bank
charter, and will read the sixteenth section   "The
bills or notes of the said corporation originally
made payable, or which shall have become paya-
able on demand %n gold, and silver com, shall be re-
cievable in all payments to the United S ates "
The gentleman from Maryland, [Mr Jones,] who
just spoke, could not hive been aware of thiü ab-
solute connec ¿on of this Bank with hard money
Indubitably the authoroi the first Bank of the
United States was an enemy to paper money    No
greater injustice can be done to the characters of
Morris and Hamilton, than to charge, as we hear
and read every day from thoughtless  or ignorant
persons, that they are answerable for the deplora-
ble paper system which deforms and destroys Ame-
rican currency.     I wish to rescue their memories
from such traduction—national property as they
boih are, and should ¿¡-«ay    be considered     If
they were living now, I wou d a=ree  to abide by
their opinion of the indispensable necessity of ex-
cluding  all   mconvert ble   bank   notes, and  all
small bank notes, con>rettible or not, from circu
lation,  as legahz«tt currency    Not an act, not
a word, can be cited ot eithei of them countenanc-
ing the abominations of this kind,  which, since
their day, pass for  money     First, then,  I  re-
peat,  the Bank of '91 was a com  bank      No
paper but that representing com ->t all times wis or
could be issued or used by  it     Secretary Hamil-
ton's Treasury circular authorising bmk notes to
be paid for public dues was j o  interference with
this obligation, because all bank notes weie then
always and instantly convertible    I beg those who
have not examined   th  charter of  that Bank,
drawn with the p.ecision and forenght of its eminent
author, to advert to the remarkable fact that, while
itconfeired on the Bank plenary power to issue
notes of any denomination—five dollar notes one dol
lar notes, or quarter dollar notes—yet the d'rec'ors
themselves spontaneously began with ten dollar
notes    Such was their spontaneous act    They
conformed to universal impression m selecting that
sum as the minimum denomination of bank notes
A five dollar note was unthought of—-miserable
tax-galherer of later limes The only three State
banks then in being, one at Philadelphia, another
at New York, and the third at Boston, I presume,
issued no lower denomination than tens Money
was then money and that was com for all the pur
poses of change—all everyday transactions—all
wages of labor—all common expenditures—reserv-
ing paper, and that always convertible, for large
payments
Secondly, that separation between Bank and
State, which we of the minority have strenuously,
and, I believe, successfully, contended for, was
fully established by the charter of the first Bank
The twenty-five directors were alt to be chosen
by the stockholders Government hid nothing
to do \ i h tne d recuon of the B rk There is not
a word in (he charter wMc places the nubhc depo
sites in it, much less in the branches as the present
bill does. Tne slxtee> th ser ion, wtrch gave the
officer at the h«?d of the Tre?sw, some supervi-
sion of the public condition of th  Bank, its specie,
circulation, debts, and deposi es, expressly inhibited
his inspection of private account•■—a perilous power
conferred by the bill betore us Ev«n t>e public
stock, of wh'ch the capi'al was to consist m part,
was reimbursable a ¿ny time with'n ten years, or
sconer, if the Government thought fit
Thu«, what has been called the divorce principle
of late contests, and the hard money, for which we
have contended, were cardinal points of that Bank,
which, compared with modern abuses of banking,
was a noble institution Its authors, duectors,
stockholders, the community, and 'he Government,
had no idea of the destructive innovations of later
date, which are to be legalised by the charter m
question
In 1811, the first Bank oí ¡the United Slates ex
pired by limitation. The attempt to revive it did
not succeed in this House, as I took the liberty to
state, correcting, with th- defeience always du  to
that venerable gentleman, [Mr Adams ] his mistake
anhonragomthis particular The majority against
it in, this House was one votr, the vote, I think,
was sixty five o sixty four, (and I have taken some
pains to be acoura e m detp s ) The subsequent at
tempt in the Se íate failed there by the casting vote of
the Vic? President, [George Clinton,] who put his
negative on constitutional pround During some
four or five years, the United S ates ^e e without
a Bank, and waged the war with Gr°at Britain
without it In 1814-35, Mr Dallas, the Secietaiy
of th  Treasury, recommended, with President
Madi«on's appn bation, a Nat.onal Bai k as neces-
sary m that ex gency, when tne Sate Btnkshad
suspended payment, and hostilities were pressing
us with all the force of a most formidable enemy
As the currency of all inter trading nations
affects each other, especially when rUaiions arc so
intimate an? extensi/e a« between England,
France, and this country, ¡t is proper that the nar-
rative, of which mj argument will mamly consist,
should, for a moment, recur to Europe, for ihe
monetary coni iion 'here and its influence here
In 1793-4, the French Govern-nent resorte' to the
revolutionary expedient o m're pnper money—■
ineonverl'biepaner Assignats an I m->nd eswere
isfcued on the oasis of pu3lic lands— !'e national
domain confiscated The never fa ling lum en
sued which has always attended such a tempts
Ii 1797-8, when the wonderful uceesses ol the
French armies res'ored c nldenc" ci -> pleted m
1799, when ihe prodigious v oicto kena ge of the
Govern nent, with national tranqoill ty and mdus
try, hard money, which had trial/ di appeared
returned, as by mirac'e pn Í evn vrp Fn c-1 has
been, as tt money, he i -,nes<, ihe firn e ¡, in-  most
prosperous of all nati ns, withstanding, in this solid
basis, overa helming shocks and debts
As com returi ed with v ctory to Franc , it dis
appeared from England *Mth disaster On a Sun
day, >n February, 1797, a pr.vy council, presided,
it is to be prt umed, bv th" p o" s p-rsonrge,
George the Tnnd, issued an oi' r, - 'he urgent
instance of the Minister, Pitt, and tne Governei of
the Bank of England, legahz rg " hat was then
fir^t called ban-* suspension, in fau frauda ent
insolvency. As soon as it coul 1 be aec imphshed,
an act of Parliament was hurried through, autho-
rizing the non-payment of 'a k notes m com, and
introducing one pound notes; not to continue,
however, longer than a few weeks. Another act
of Parliament soon extended this suspension till the
end of the session, then another, till the end of the
war, and at last it became the settled distemper of
English currency For near three and twenty
years did this calamity endure. During that pros-
trate, dishonored, and desperate condition of
Great Britain, it was that most of the national
debt was contracted in depreciated currency,
which, far from proving a blessing, is the great
curse of that great nation, which nothing but
the sponge (often partially applied) can relieve
Ihem from, which was sometimes accumulated
at the rate of not less than four hundred
millions of dollars in one year, for the li-
quidation of which the fictitious sinking fund
is confessed to be of no use, which, in a word,
fetters the freest and richest nation of Europe with
bonds, never to be removed or lightened without
convulsion With infinite difficulty, at last, the
good sensp and intelligence of a few men of both
parties got the better of a palsying and wasting
degradation Great Britain was brought back to
at least the poor Ihree-for-one basis of banit paper
to com, on which, smc< then, the circulation of
that great community has been tottering and strug-
gl ng along, with still hurtful fluctuations, pa-
mes, failure*, and distress But the box of Pan-
dora was op°ned. The fatal secret was disclosed
to avarice, contrivance, and fraud, that money
may be iride without metal, that bank failure or
bankruptcy may be deemed mere suspension of
pavment, and that if law, on ths tyrant plea of
necessity, will sustain bank managers m substi-
tuting mere paper promises to pay for actual pay-
ment, a sort of currency may be kept up with
which business can limp along, defrauding indus-
try So far did this rev 1 ition make head before
it was over ome, that puMic opinion and mtel-
hgerce «eie at length mrverted, and mystified to
believe that bullion is all a delusion, that printed
and pictured paper is good enough money, and
the precious metals may be discarded altogether as
standards or coins
We are ant pupils m Ameitca of such lessons of
English authority In 1814, all the banks seuih of
New England suspended specie payments, and it
was one of the motives for the revival of a Bank
of the United States, ¡n the autumn of that year,
hat both war and bank suspension wer? upon us
I was in Co lgicss, then, intimate with Mr Dallas,
and suppor ed his pn nosed Bank with the zeal of
an ardent advocate of the exigencies thought to
render H indispensable After passing various
difficulties negauved by (he casting vote of the
Speaker, Mr Cheves, and agam by the veto of the
Presiden , Madisj , it finally became a law on the
10th of Apul, 1816 It is proper, however, to add
i^at Mr Dallas s Treasury circular of that year,
enjo ring the payment of public dues in something
like com, was an action of the Treasury, mdepen-
ient of lhat or ihe Bank It «ent into operation
m Janua y, 1817, and, as I frequently heard Mr
Dallas piedict it vould and must be, was several
years in bringing about the relief expected from it.
He did nut anticipate among its difficulties the
fiaudulrn' sto"k speculations of many of its prin-
cipal oiTceis ,. rd directors, which rendered its be-
diming almost as discreditable as its end This
House appoin ed a committee to investigate atPhi-
Ulelphia those usages, as the/ seem to be, of
Banit management, of which William Lowndes
and th- present President, Mr Tyler, were mem-
bers The hour limiia ion requires my omitting
many remni kable circumstances to come at once
tithe remo "1 of the depo  tes m '33 by a high
hand, agai t which much of the intelligence of the
ciuntry ¡evolted Then broke out the waracitn-
ternecionem between the President of ihe United
S ates and die President of the Bank, which, also,
I shall pass over with little notice. Dehrant reges,
plectuntur Achvici I must say, meaning no of-
fence, and speaking impersonallv, that the Bank
did not fall b/ veto blows The veto i self de-
clared so Eminent public men, now extremely
desirous to chai ter such an institution, I believe,
are answerable for the destruction of the second
Bank of the United States    It expired felo de se—,
