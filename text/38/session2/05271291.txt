Mr. STEWART. I offer this amendment, to
come in after the word " section," in line seven
hundred and ten, on the 30ih page:
Provided, That this section shall not apply to teams,
wagons, or vehicles used in transporting silver ores irom
the mine where the same are extracted to the place of
reduction.
I hope this amendment will prevail. It will
obviate the principal difficulty we have in Nevada,
and prevent the putting of an impediment in the
way of opening new mines and trying experi-
ments, which is the great business of the country,
it will not operate in any other State. While sil-
ver mining is in its infancy it will do no harm to
the revenue, and it will enable the teamsters to
bring the rock from the desert for the purpose of
experimenting. I think it will be a great relief
to our people; it will allow them to go ahead with
their experiments. I ask for the yeas and nays
on the amendment.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. McDOUGALL. This is a desirable amend-
ment, and a just one. I wish not to argue, but
merely to affirm that as a matured opinion from a
knowledge of the country, and the Senator from
Nevadaunderstands it much better than I do my-
self, and much better than any of us. I trust the
amendment will be adopted.
The question being taken by yeas and nays,
resulted—yeas 20, nays 11; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Buckalew, Connesc, Cowan, Doolittle,
Farwell, Foot, Hat Ian, Henderson, Hendricks, Johnson,
Lane ol Kansas, Me Denial!, Morgan, Morn II, Nye, Sprague,
fcstewait, Sumner, Van Winkle, and Wright—20.
NAYS—Messrs. Clark, Davis, Foster, Grimes, Lane of
Indiana, Powell, Riddle, Sherman, Ten Eyck, Willey, and
Wilson—11.
ABSENT—Messrs. Anthony. Brown, Carlile, Chandler,
Collamer, Dixon, Hale, Harding. Hams, Howard, Howe,
Nesmirh, Pomeroy, Ramsey, Kich'ardson, Saulsbtiry, Tium-
buli, Wade, and Wilkinson—]9.
So the amendment was agreed to.
Mr. MORRILL. On page 45, section four,
after the word " ninety-four*' in hue two, I move
to insert "and fifty-five," so as to read: "That
in addition to the duties imposed in sections
ninety-four, and fifty-five," &c.
Mr. JOHNSON. What is the effect of that?
Mr. MORRILL. I will explain in a word.
As the bill now stands section four imposes an
additional tax of twenty per cent, upon the pres-
ent tax on manufacturesgenerally. Thisamend-
ment will impose the same increase of tax on
manufactured liquors. I see no reason why the
same rule should not apply. I do not wish to
argue the question.
Mr. SHERMAN. The effect would be to in-
crease the tax on whisky to $2 40a gallon instead
of two dollars. I am satisfied the article will not
bear that. I am satisfied that the present duty
is almost driving its distillation into such secret
places that it is very difficult to avoid frauds. I
believe it would be very unwise to attempt to in-
crease the tax on wlusky. At any rate, at this
period of the session, it is very unwise to intro-
duce that controversy into the other House.
Mr. MORRILL. I was told that they contem-
plated an additional tax of fifty per cent, in the
other House, which led me to make this sugges-
tion. I do not know howit Is, but it seems to me
very difficult to see why it is there should be a
discrimination in favor of the manufacture of
whisky.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. SPRAG-CJE. I move to amend the bill by
striking out the fourth section. That section
taxes ail kinds of manufactures twenty per cent,
in addition to the tax now assessed. The present
tax is five per cent., and this is one per cent, in
addition, making it six per cent. The manufac-
turing inteiest in this country and in England is
satisfied with two and one half per cent, profit.
The Government of the United States propose by
this bill to take from that interest in this country
two profits and a half. TheCommittee on Finance
have suggested, and the Senate has confirmed
their suggestion, that one half per cent, be taxed
upon all sales. That proposition was rejected by
the other House, it has struck me, on examina-
tion of the question, that the proposition to tax
sales, which is eminently proper and judicious,
would be more sure to prevail in that House if
this increased tax on manufactures was stricken
out of the bill.
1 tell the Senate in good faith, in as good faith
as it is possible for one man to tell another any-
thing, that the present tax of five per cent, is de-
stroying an interest that is producing very much
income to the Treasury. I tell you that those who
are employed in the manufacture of cottons—and
it is in regard to that interest that 1 speak more
particularly—are not half as well paid as they
were before this war, but they have been obliged
to continue in thatemployment because they have
no means to remove irom it. I tell the Senate,
too, that during the greater period of the warcot-
ton manufacturing has been a losing business to
those engaged in it, but they have employed their
machinery and tried to keep their capital intact
for the purpose of being ready when the war
closes to continue their business. Throughout
the country to-day not one fourth of the capital
or of the machinery employed before the war is
employed; and those engaged ^re not halfso well
paid as they were before the war. The Govern-
ment derives every mill of profit and more upon
that interest.
I should not feel that I had done my duty if I
did not protest against and resist this exaction. It
has appeared to me that Senators do not compre-
hend this question at all. They have not exhib-
ited any information on this important interest,
for look at it: they impose a high ad valoi-em tax
on cotton manufactures when the war has made
the value of cotton ten times what it was before,
and this taxation falls on those who are least able
to bear it; men who get their one or two dollars
a day are taxed by this bill more than any tax
that was ever levied in the history of any civil-
ized country.
I tell you, sir, this policy is destroyingthis great
interest. I tell you that the three percent, tax which
you put upon the manufacturers in the beginning
gave to you more revenue than the five percent.,
and the five per cent, hasgiven you more revenue
than you can get from the six per cent, now pro-
posed. You tax it at that rate, though previous
to the war it would have been satisfied with two
and a half per cent, profit, I tell you one fourth
of the capital invested in this interest is dead cap-
ital. I tell you that the operatives engaged in this
employment are engaged at one half the compen-
sation they received previous to this war. And
I tell you the capital invested in it receives no
compensation, but is losing money, and has been
for two years past.
These facts are known to me, and they must he
apparent to everybody who is obliged to buy cot-
ton fabrics, and to any one who examines the
question, it seems tome that there should be
some discrimination for an article of prime neces-
sity, an article which the masses of the people are
hardly able to procure now, and yet that article
is taxed three or four times the amount that any
other article which is consumed is taxed.
I move that this section be stricken out. That
motion may not prevail. If not, I shall move that
cotton manufactures be included in the proviso to
the section so as to exempt them from the increase.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. SPRAGUE. i now move to amend the
fourth section by inserting " cottons" among the
list of manufactured articles in the proviso to that
section.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. HENDRICKS. * 1 offer the following
amendment as an additional section:
Jhul he it further enacted, That whenever distilled spirits
shall be taken from a bonded warehouse for coiusinnptupn,
the cpnits «hall, if the owner •-hall require it, he again in-
spected and gauged, and the duty shall be paid on the num-
ber of gallons tlius ascertained to be in the barrels taken
tiom the bonded warehouse.
This amendment is just to this effect; as the
law now stands the barrels are gauged when taken
from the distillery to the bonded warehouse, other-
wise they would be gauged when taken from the
distillery forsale, if not to the bonded warehouse.
This proposition is that they shall be gauged for
the purposes of taxation at the time they are
taken out of the bonded warehouse for sale; that
that quantity solely shall be the quantity taxed.
The amendment was rejected.
Mr. HOWE. For the purpose of getting an
amendment that I wish to be adopted before the
Senate, as J want itacted upon, I will offer it once
more. It is after the word " accounting," in the
forty-fifth line on the 3d page, to add:
And by add ins: after the first proviso in the same section
the following: " Provided farther, That no more shall be
allowed to any assessor for clerk hire In any one ypar than
•seventy cent* for eaeh hundred names assessed m Iu-j dis-
trict, and no more shall be allowed to any as-e^soriot sta-
tionery in any year than one cent for each naine assessed
m his district."
I gave some figures on which I was induced to
move this amendment; and now, not to detain the
Senate by reargument of the question, but in order
to inform the country of my reasons for urging
this amendment upon the Senate, I ask leave to
present some tables that they may be printed in
the Globe.
