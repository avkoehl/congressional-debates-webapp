give Warren nearly 25,000 men. My object in making this suggestion is, as Warren ranks Humphreys and would take the command, it is better for him to have his whole corps. Humphreys would not go unless two divisions of his corps are sent.

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., December 3, 1864 - 5.30 p. m.

Major-General MEADE:

If but one corps goes on the expedition mentioned in my dispatch of this morning I would as soon General Humphreys would command it as any other officer. Thinking, however, it better to take a larger force, I named relieving part of the Fifth Corps because I would sooner trust General Warren in command than General Wright. I think there should be a force of 20,000 infantry, and then all the reserves that can possibly be spared from the lines should be held ready to go after the enemy if he follows. I will write my views more fully before the expedition starts.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,OFFICE OF THE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL,

December 3, 1864.

Major General G. G. MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: The following deserters from the enemy are forwarded to-day: Two from Holcombe Legion, Wallace's brigade, Johnson's division; one from Thirty-fourth Virginia, Wise's brigade, Johnson's division; one from Thirty-eighth North Carolina, Scales' brigade, Wilcox's division; one from Second North Carolina Cavalry, Barringer's brigade; one from Cobb's Legion, Young's brigade. From them we learn that no troops have left the front of the Army of the Potomac excepting the dismounted cavalry under General Young. No change in the enemy's position. Rumor that Mahone's division had gone to Stony Creek with 1,200 men; no evidence of such a movement. No news of Sherman's movements.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumbers C. BABCOCK.
