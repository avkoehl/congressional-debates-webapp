mas'ers   Nosuchinstitutionsaremamtained here
by th° States, the General Government has not
the power of this patronagf, mdpuvate patronage
is alone inadequate     Does the gentleman know
the magnitude of the und( i taking of one of these
paintings, the aitis* thus unaided'   Sir, the artist
must devote himself exclusively for years to the
woik   thiee, five, ay, ten yeais, are not too long
to study and finish i woik to adorn your Capitol
He must study anatom> , he must tiavel to Italy
foi his maten tls and  his composition     What
artist n this countiy tin bear the e\pense and
sacrifice of his ume, unless he has the Government
contiact foi his guarantee'    JNone, unless his
* pockets are hned w tli it least $5,000 to spai e and
to risk     Bt sides, su, above all sensitive men on
eaitb, artists aie the most sensitive     They will
never consent to undertake such immense works,
at so much usk to themselves of pccumaiy loss,
reputation   and feeling, without a certainty of
compensation     Ihiy can nevei be biought by
necessity to  hazard foi tune  and  fame  upon a
painting to be offer* d to this Government—to Le
undervalued—ciiticised by eveiy pietendei  who
knows   not foieshortemng fiom coloiing—and
then to bo lejected, peihaps as unworthy     Sn,
you must encom age their i ffoitsbtfoie you enjoy
the benefits of thousand bcfoityoui countiy will
be graced by then labois    The paintings now m
the lotunda weie voted foi bef ne they were ex
ecuted      I agiee with the gentlcm in iiom Rhode
Island, tint the sell etion of the subjects should
be left to the artists themselves     No aitist can
paint well fiom the selection of   inothei      His
pictuie must be of his own fancy, lie must bu n
with his own conception, 01  hit, pamtn g wil'
never please the eye of the imagination     And if
the gentleman from Rhode Isl nd h id attended to
the resolution, he would hive seen that the stlcc
tion of subjects is left to the aiusts themselves,
subject to the judgment of a select committee
The gentleman asks, vvho could pictuio  i mob'
Hogaith, sir, pictuitd a mob   and if the gentle
man will step into any bookstoie h wing his    n
gravings, he can see a fellow so maddem d with
the rage of a mob, that he is sawing himself
down from the top of a sign post   &n, I suwitly
know wlnt the gi nth man me ins by an " austo
cratic paintui"'," or by «B>'i(««mpiuicip.!cs,in this
discussion     One of the icasons why joi   in lists
are pioposcd to be employed is, that we know
not who is ically the grcu stof th   eoips   lime
is something national in miking the trial     It is
not to pull down the. hist  to the common huí,
but to asccrtiin whetlu rthe favontism of pnvatu
patronage m ty not have distinguished some one
undeseivcdiy ibove the otheis     We have fu
quontly employed foreign aiusts, sn, at a gicat
expense, md I now desne uly much to si e if
Amctica cannot bestow hei fa vol s and lawful
patronage m such a niannci, on Aniciiem artists,
as to nurtuie the finei aits, to lllustiati, in then
turn, the arms, the civicvntucs,aud the glorious
deeds of this illustiious nation
Mr BURGLS did not*risc-to follow the gen
tleman from Virginia [Mr Wisf] thioujh ill
his colorings of the fine aits He muely wished
to contradict one of his asseitions Thi gentle-
man had said that his (Mi B 's) object had
"peeped out"—that he was feailul that some in
cident conntcttd with the life of the piesentC luef
Magistrate might fbim the subject of one of the
proposed paintings He was not in the h ibit of
"peeping ' at all, and vvl ere he could find Ian
guage to cxpiess himself he alw lys used it He
had no desire to withhold fiom postciity the
noble and gloiious achievements of the CI icf
Magistiate but he tiusted m God that postenty
would nevi i be made acquainted with the ictions
and motives of some of those who weie at times
found m the real, supporting the Piesident, and
at other times m fiont, haiassmg and attacking
him
Mr WISEsaid, inreply, that heeould notcon
ceive how h could bo m ulc, 01 how anything he
had said could make hin , the subject of the un
worthy allusion of the gentkman from Rhod
Island I feel myself, sir, incompetent to make
a pioj>a íeplytohim Silence is, perhaps, the
best that couid be made, as that gentleman is no
toriouslya " privdegei character," as he has been
called on this flooi But, sn, 1 cannot conceive
why he should, unless fiom constitutioral weak
ness,*as well as weakness, of old age, go out of
his way to spit at me, on this occasion, his habit-
ual and characteristic venom and mahg-----
[Here the Speaker shook his head ]
Sir, I leave the blank to be filled by the House,
who know him well Sir, I know not, and I caie
not, whether the President, or any friend of his,
desires the battle of New Oileans, or any other
event of his life, the subject of either of these
paintings As I befoie said, I would prefer the
events of the Revolution but I care not what
subjects are selected, so that Amencan artists are
chosen, and the subjects and the execution com-
port with the dignity of our national lustoiy,and
the works tend to nuiture the aits at home, and
íedound to the ciedit of oui own country
The question was then taken on the amend-
ment, and carried—ayes 104, noes not counted
Aftei some conversation between Messis VIN
TOi\, ADAMS, WISE, and JARVIS, the leso
lution was so modified, on motion of the lattei,
as to confine the subjects of the paintings to in
cidents 11 the histoiy of the countiy pnor to the
peace of 1781   but befo e the question was taken,

IMPROVriUENTS OI  THE WABASH RIVER.
On rnotion of Mi   TIPTON, the Senate pro
cetded to consider the lesolution  submitted by
him yisteiday, for an inquiry into the expedí
ency of in ippiopn ition toimpiove the Wabash
All  T  sud he was desuous of making anothei
' effort to obtain an appiopuation to impiove the
nwigation of the Wat ash     It is with great íe-
luctanc , (sud  Mr   T ) that I obtiudu mvsclf
upon the  notice of the Sen"te, but this subject
is of such vital impoitance to my constituents
that I cannot let it rest without making another
efloit  to  scive  tht,m     Bills  have  passed both
bi inches of Congiess at difteientsessions appio
pi i umg mom y to impiove that river, but *othese
bills the Piesident of the United Stites has íe
fused his sanction,! have no doubt, undei amis
taken idea of the claims of the nvei, as well as
the facts of the cas°   I consider it due to mysilt,
and not disrespectful to the Piesident of the Uni
ted States, to say tint I differ fiom him in opinion
m relation to tue powei to appropinte money to
improve the navigation of oui nvers     He does
I not feel authorized to sanction appropriations to
I impiove livers unless it be such as lead to a poit
of entry established by law, and he has more than
once refused his sanction to bills to improve thp
Wabash river upon that ground, as I understand
him I contend that the power exists to approm i
ate money toimpiove nversm any part of the Uni-
ted States where the business of the country and
the capacity of the river require such lmpiove-
ment, and I have no feais in trusting the money *
in the Tieasui y to the discretion of Congi ess and
the President, to be appiopriated to such objects
as the mteiest of the coeuiti y may require Under
the supeivision and control that the people hold
over then public servants through the ballot-box,
all is then perfectly safe
The President, in his annual message, with
which he íeturncd the Wabash bill to the Senate,
h is signified that, if a port of entry was established
on the Wabash, it would bring appiopuations to
impiove th itnvci within the rule that he has laid
down foi the government of his own action in
such cases Without being able to pciceive cither
the wisdom or the justice of the rule, I have de-
termine d to yield to the necessities of the case,
and so fai to coi form to it as to ask the Senate
to pass a bill establishing a port of entiy at the
town of Lafayette, and another appiopnatmg
money to impiove the nvei, and hope that hon-
oiable ¡senators will give both their support
At the late session of Congiess the bill for im-
proving the Wabash was laid before the Presi-
dent on the 28th of June, two days before Con-
gress adjourned, and on the 30th of that month,
on the last day of the session, we received a ver-
bal message through our committee, mfoiming us
that the Piesident of the United States had ap
pioved and signed all the bills passed by the two
blanches of Congress at the then present session,
except that for improving the navigation of the
Wabash and as that bill involved a question of
importance, he had letamed it for further consid-
eration In his message returning this bill to the
Senate, the President stated that he had not been
able to satisfy his mind that the bill ought to pass
Ho goes on to state his objections to extiavagant
appi opriations for internal impiovcment, and
aigues over again the case of the Maysville road
bill, buthesays not onewoid of thements or the
dements of the Wabash bill, against which I con-
tend that no sound leasomng can be produced,
drawn fiom the Constitution or the piactice of this
Government from its foundation Nor am I able
to discover any necessary connection between
the Maysville i oad bill and the Wabash bill The
foimei piovidesfoi a local object—the construc-
tion of a road from one point to anothei within
a State, the latter provides the means to improve
an important nvei, the line of demaication be
tween two States, a leserved public highway, as
I shall piesently show
The common phrase, internal improvement, is
g°nerally used m speaking of roads and canals
these may be local, and best constructed by the
individual State within which they he, because a
load or canal can be constiucted in any direction
thiough a State or county But, sir, improving
the navigation of oui rivers is veiy different The
liveis of the United States are the common prop-
el ty of all everybody may navigate them with-
out let oi hindrance, and that the joint funds of
the nation should improve them cannot, in my
judgment, be denied This principle has been
acted upon from oui earliest history, and I know
of no case where the General Government has-
íefused to improve a river of so much importance
j to any portion of oui country as the Wabash is
to the western States
The appiopuation now asked for is to be ex-
pended in connection with other appropriations
to open a line of commumcation by water fiom
j New \ ork to New Oilcans     It should be borne
in mind that laige appropiiations have been made
to impiove the Huekon, the Mississippi, and the
I Ohio nvers, the New Yoik canal eonm ets the
' Hudson river with lake Ene at Buffalo, the
Wabash and Eue canal will connect lake Ene,
I through the Maumee bay, with the Wabash, at
i oi  near the town of Lafayette     This canal is
upwauls of two hundred miles long, about sev-
enty tight miles in the State of Ohio and one
hundred  and twenty tight within the State of
lndima, this  canal  is now b"ing  constiucted
Tlmty five miles  of that portion of this woik
lying within the State of Indiana is finished, and
lead/ to be filled with water next spring, forty
