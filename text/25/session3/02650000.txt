Report of the Secietary of War.
War Department,
November 28, 1838
Sir' I have the honor to submit to you the fol-
lowing report upon the several branches of the
public service confided to the superintendence of
the War Department.
The provisions of Congress for the increase and
organization of the army have been carried into
execution, as far as the limited time since the pas-
sage of the act, and thecircumstancesof the coun-
try, would permit The eighth regiment of infan-
try, authorized by law, has been raised, officered,
and equipped for the field, as have four additional
companies of artillery The staff of the army
has been completed in every department, accord-
ing to the intentions of Congress, and will form a
most efficient branch of the service In execution
of the law of March 2, 1821, which says " That
*  each regiment of artillery shall consist of one
* colonel, one lieutenant colonel, one major, one
*  sergeant major, one quartermaster sergeant, and
4 nine companies, owe of which shall be designated
' and equipped as light artilleiy^" I have caused one
company of artilieiy to be mounted, and armed
with their appropriate aim. It is very desnable
that the intentions of this provision of the law,
which have been so long postponed, should be
carried into effect without further delay, and I
would lecommend that this description of force,
so important in the composition of an army, and
so efficient m the field, be increased by separating
two companies from each regiment of artillery,
and forming with them two battalions of light
artillery, one to be stationed in the western, and
the other m the eastern division of the army
The only additional increase of the aimy at-
tending this arrangement, which is calculated to
add very considerably to its effective stiength,
will be that of the field officers of the battalions.
The army has been actively and usefully em-
ployed, as will be seen from the report of the
Commanding General, partly on the southwestern
and northern frontiers, and partly in the Cherokee
country. With a view to render it more efficient,
I would recommend that the places and manner
of quartering and stationing the troops in time of
peace be changed Scattered in small detachments
and distant posts, it would be impracticable to
unite any part of it in Sufficient strength to mane
an effective resistance upon any one point of either
fiontter, and equally so to impart to them that
discipline and skill in military maneuveis which
they will have to practice in time of war, and
Which will enable them to meet an enemy in the
field on equal terms The object of our fortresses
is to defend our harbors, and to arrest the first
progress of an enemy's arms, and this may be
effected by small garrisons of regular troops, aided
by a well-trained militia. Our militia, covered by
works and fortifications, have proved themselves,
from their dexterity in firing, to be superior to the
best European troops, but it cannot stand against
them in the field, from its want of instruction and
military organization, if, therefore, the army is
No. 1
to remain shut up in fortresses, and militia to be
depended upon to march to their relief, in case of
invasion, we fad to avail ourselves of the advant-
ages that may be derived from the different quali-
ties of these troops In the present state of the
art of war, no fortress is impregnable, and each in
its turn would be forced to yield, if attacked, unless
there was an army ready to march to its relief, for
the militia, although perfectly competent to defend
the forts, would be found incapable of contending
with disciplined troops in the field, or of storming an
intrenched camp My object would be, therefore,
so to station the troops, that they should form a
center arou d which the militia may rally, and the
combined forces march to the relief of any point
that may be menaced or attacked The points
which appear to me best calculated for such sta-
tions as aie heremdica'ed,are,in the State of New
Yoik, on Lake Champlam, whence troops may be
moved w.th facility towards the northern or east-
ern frontier, and to protect the sea-board In
Pennsylvania, at Carlisle, where exist already
good barracks, and from whence troops may be
moved rapidly upon any point of the coast north
of the Chesapeake In the State of South Carolina
or Georgia, not far from the head waters of the
Savannah river, a commanding position may be
occupied, from whence troops might be trans-
ported to any point between the Chesapeake and
Florida, with nearly equal expedition The fourth
station I would recommend is Jefferson barracks,
a central post as regards the southwestern frontier,
Louisiana, and all the western States, presenting
extensive lines of water communication, which
greatly facilitate the movements of the troops upon
any point of the western division These stations,
supplied with a competent regular force, and, when
the occasion requires it, augmented by the hardy
mil itia collected from the neighboring States, would
be able to contend successfully with any force that
could be sent against this countiy, whilst small
gainsons of regulars, a.ded by the volunteers and
militia of the maritime and inland frontiers, might
occupy the forts and defend them until the corps
d'armee nearest the point attacked could march to
their relief In no other way can an extensive line
of frontier, like that of the United States, be de
fended by a small army such as ours To cany
this measure into effect, it will be necessary to ask
of Congress an appropriation for the purpose of
erecting and extending theaccommodations for the
troops at the points indicated
The spaise population of the western frontier
and the number, character, and proximity of the
enemy we have to guard against in that quarter,
will require that the garrisons of the several posts
should be stronger than on the maritime or north-
ern and eastern frontiers, and it is respectfully
recommended that the measures proposed by the
Department for the defense of that frontier, the
last year, should be persisted in. It is to be re-
gretted that those measures were not sanctioned by
Congress at its last session The law of the 2J
July, 1836, is in progress of execution, and every
exertion has been made to meet the wishes of the
framers of it. The survey of the whole line of
road has been wade, and part of it under contract.
I should not, however, discharge my duty as the
officer charged with this branch of the public ser-
vice, if I refrained from reiterating my opinion,
that the plan proposed by that law would not only
be inefficient, but, if carried out to its full extent,
would produce immediate hostilities with the In-
dian tribes on that frontier. So confident am I
that the withdrawal of the garrison from Port Sib-
son would be the signal of an outbreak on the part
of the Indians, that I have ventured to suspend
the execution of that part of the law until an oppor-
tunity could be given to Congress to reconsider
that order, and would respectfully sugge/st that
the position of the posts, the direction of the linea
of communication, and all the details relating to
the defenses of the frontiers, should be left to that
departmentof the Government which is responsible
for the peace and defense of the country. I wit!
briefly recapitulate the plan of defense proposed
by me, in ordei to bring it again to the notice
of Congress, with an expression of my convic-
tion that, if adopted, it will prove effectual for
the protection of the settlement on that frontier,
and will impose such a restraint upor the Indians
as to keep them quiet and peaceable, as well as
to enable the authorities of the United States fully
to comply with their treaty stipulations with those
tribes, and protect them against intrusion from the
whites.
1 propose that the existing fortresses within the
Indian territory should be enlarged and strength-
ened, and others erected at the Illinois river, near
(he line of the State of Arkansas, at Table creek',
near the Missouri river, below the Platte; and at
the upper folks of the Des Moines, these stations
to be connected by good roads, perpendicular to
the line of defense, and connecting it with an in-
terior line of posts to be established at convenient
points, to serve as places of refuge for the inhabit-
ants in periods of alarm or danger, where they
could remain in safety until relieved by the regu-
lar troops This, with some additional depots of
arms at points judiciously selected, and a good
organization of the neighboring militta, would
furnish ample security and protection to the bor-
dering States The works on the exterior line,
especially, should be built of permanent materials,
and in a manner to insure the health and comfort
of the soldier, and to be defended by a small gar-
l'son
In order to maintain these remote posts at the
least possible expense, as well as to secure per-
manent and seasonable supplies, I would recom-
mend that a farm be attached to each of them, to
be worked by a given number of laborers, under
a competent superintendent, with the assistance
Of the soldiers at seed time and harvest For this
purpose it will be necessary to have the authority
of Congt ess to hire the necessary number of labor-
ers, it having been found by experience that the
constant employment of soldiers in the cultivation
of the soil is incompatible with discipline or the
acquisition of military skill. They may, how-
ever, be made very useful at particular season 
of the year, without any detriment to the service.
I have seen no reason to change my views as to
the proper organization of a miirtm or volunteer
