Virginia for supplies this winter, and unless a change is at once made cars cannot pass at all. Hagood's brigade arrived at Danville Thursday morning at 7 o'clock, since which time I have made every effort to get them on, but all haves not yet reached this point, making three days in transporting one brigade a distance of forty-eight miles. I have ordered Colquitt and Clongman to march here, where ample provisions are made for their immediate transportation. It is urged and recommended that possession be taken of this road and place it in charge of the North Carolina Central Railroad Company, who has sufficient and suitable machinery for operations. Should this be done, cars loaded at Charlotte with freight would not be unloaded until they reach Danville and hence avoid the delay at Greensborough, where the accumulation of supplies is immense. The president and directors who now control the road have power over no rolling-stock save that which belongs to called upon to do the work. I have seen T. J. Sumner, superintendent and engineer of the Central Company, who says, that with proper management and much work the road can be put in good condition. The character of Mr. Sumner as an engineer is fully established and well known to the Quartermaster-General. If necessary, military possession should be taken of the road, otherwise the accumulation of supplies in Richmond will be impossible, and in future might force us to do that which we would not desire. from what I could see I think efforts will be made on the part of the president and directors who now manage it to hold the road, which should not be for a moment considered, as its present condition is sufficient to prove their incapacity or want of attention. My troops are now wanted in Wilmington, where they should have been two days ago. No one but yourself can make the above and much wanted change.

Very respectfully,

R. F. HOKE,

Major-General.

P. S.-Mr. Sumner will at any time you wish go into Petersburg to communicate with you fully on the matter, as he feels the importance of the charge, which I hope will be done. He can give you any and all the information you want about the delays.
