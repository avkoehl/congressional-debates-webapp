THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 23,
wanted, but to some middleman, or contractor,
who, after receiving thfe order from the Navy
agent, goes into the market and buys at his own
price of the legitimate and regular dealers, and
the articles are sent direct from the warehouses
of the first venders to the navy-yard, the con-
tractors not being to the expense even of storage.
The Navy reports show that such contractors as
Smith Brothers & Co. and C. W. Scofield & Co.,
whose regular business is that of dealing in hard-
ware, have, under this system, furnished to the
Navy Department firewood, lumber, lime, hair,
plaster, iron, nails, hardware, paints, glass, ship-
chandlery, charcoal, oils, belting, staves, pack-
ing, leather hose, stoves, cooking utensils, tin,
and copper. In Philadelphia, among the princi-
pal furnishers of goods to the Government upon
the requisitions of the Navy agent are Noblit,
Brown & Noblit, cabinet-makers, who furnish
spelter, port-lights, glue, chalk, life-preservers,
sheathing felt, yellow metal, copper-wire, as-
phaltum, Japan dryers' oil, leather, screw-bolts,
and iron chains; and D. B. Dieterich, dealer in
India-rubber goods, who furnishes hardware,
lime, sheet-hemp, hose, gas pipe, glass, whiting,
wire rope, gun gaskets, buff leather, cut nails,
coffee boxes, block tin, pig lead, tarred paper,
&c.
Those who have taken the trouble to examine
the subject have discovered that what I have al-
ready said of master-workmen and employes in
the yards is true also of the contractors. There is
a change of contractors just as regularly as there
is a political change in the national Administra-
tion. No matter what may be the professed po-
litical opinions of either Navy agents or contract-
ors, it will be invariably found that the agents
and the great leading contractors are in perfect
personal accord. Referring to the published
schedule of contractors attached to the annual re-
ports of the Secretary of the Navy, it will be dis-
covered that the names of the principal contract-
ors since 1861 are new to tlu  report. They
have been brought into prominence by the new
Navy agents and the political influences that are
behind both. Smith Brothers & Co. only became
contractors in 1861,and since that time have been
paid upon their contracts $1,010,582 93..- il. D.
Stover, a comparatively new name in the Navy
Department, has in the same time received
$1,023,138 93. C. W. Scofield & Co., of New
York, began their contracts at the same time and
have been paid $1,152,214 99, and Trickey &
Jowett, a firm composed of a citizen of New
Hampshire and a citizen of Maine, only began to
contractin 38G2,andhavenlready received forlum-
ber, hay, and provender,delivered at the Kittery
and Charlestown navy-yards,$1,383,650 32, with
large deliveries and payments yet to be made upon
their contracts, it is not a difficult thing, Mr.
President, to denounce one'sadversaries, whether
real or imaginary, for frauds or for profligate ex-
penditures, but it does doubtless require the ex-
ercise of some public virtue to assist in breaking
up a system by which one's friends are gorging
themselves with public plunder.
And now, Mr. President, to show that the pro-
hibition of nominal bids has been of no advantage
to the Government, and can be of none so long
as there can be collusion between the Navy agents
and contractors, or between contractors and mas-
ter mechanics and mspectois, without <i prompt
responsibility and as prompt a punishment, 1
will illustrate by a few examples.
As already stated, one of the principal con-
tracting firms at the New York yard is Q. W. Sco-
field& Co. A very large part of their deliveries
to the Government were made upon what are
called open purchases; that is to say, upon orders
from the Navy agent at New York directing them
to deliver to the naval storekeeper at the yard
these certain specified articles. These orders con-
tain no allusion to the price to be paid, no mem-
orandum of the market value of the articles, and
no offers from dealers in similar articles, or cer-
tificates of value from dealers, as required by the
departmental circular of December 29,1855. Now,
it so happens that the books of C. W. Scofield
& Co. are in the hands of an agent of the Gov-
ernment, and from these books, kept by them-
selves, the following statement has been pre-
pared. It will be observed that the first column
contains the cost price of the articles named and
the last column the price at which the same arti-
cles were turned over to the Government:

(IV. C. The $1,865 97 is supposed to cover the whole
cost of the above bill.—H. F. S.)
I am told, Mr. President, that these are by no
means the most flagrant cases of robbery exhib-
ited by the books of Scofield & Co., and are not
the basis of the charges upon which the members
of that firm are now being tried before a naval
court-martial. And yet we are gravely told by
the Naval Committee of the Senate, in their re-
port, that the system under which thissortofrob-
bery can be perpetrated with impunity " has been
in operation more than half a century, and, in the
opinion of your committee, has operated weli, and
is well calculated to effect the object sought to be
attained, namely, supplying the Navy at reason-
able prices with the best articles demanded for the
public service!"
I hold ifl my hand a table showing the amount
of oils delivered at the New York navy-yard dur-
ing the last two years, the date of delivery, the
price at which it was furnished to the Govern-
ment, and the market price of the article at the
time the delivery was made, as compiled by an
intelligent and reliable merchant. These invoices
of oils were mostly secured upon open purchases
upon the requisition of the Navy agent,and turned
outto be, ill most cases, adulterated by theadmix-
ture of oils of an inferior quality, although in-
variably to be of the best quality known in the
market. [See table referred ,to at the foot of next
page.]
The Senate will obtain a very correct idea of the
manner in which the naval supply system is con-
ducted in New York, our most important navy-
yard, from the extracts of a letter from Nathaniel
Wilson, Esq., to the Secretary of the Navy, under
date of May 19, 1864. Mr. Wilson is a most in-
telligent and reliable authority, and is the special
counsel of the Navy Department in investigating
frauds committed in New York. It must be borne
in mind that the inspector spoken of by Mr. Wil-
son is an officer appointed by the commandant of
the yard, and is not an officer c.ieated by law.
<l 1 have proof that from fifty to seventy-live per cent.,
exclusive of provisions and clothing, of ail the open pur-
j chase? for the Biooklvn navy-yat<1 during the hist year
| wore made through the house of C. YV. Scofield St Co. I
have heretoloie .-fated lliat a justification for the course
ptir-ued is sought by the Navy agent in the circulars ironi
the Dupnitnii'M teiative to the piefercnoo to be given to
contractors in the distribution ot otdets tor goods at open
purchase. 1 now call youi attention to another explana-
tion. It is tillered that very many ot the most respectable
meiehants ol New York decline ro sell dneeily to the Gov-
ernment because, of the disappointments and delays to
which they are subjected in the payment or bills. It id
stated that theie are difficulties and detention* in obtain-
ing the approval of bills at the mivy-\ aid, and that there is
tinther trouble and tardiness in procuring the money due
lor good- deliveted, upon bills> approved, iioni the Tieasury
thiough the Navy agent. These reasons, it is said, deter
merchants from selling their goods to the Government, and
cause those who do sell to charge higher figures than any
private person would be expeeted or would be willing to
pay.
"Undoubtedly the causes I have mentioned have had
considerable efiect in excluding meichants of the Setter
cl.i*s from the lists of those who sell to the Navy Depart-
ment. The delay referred to is paitially necessanly inci-
dent to the system which substitutes for one diu'ct, respons-
ible head a scoie or more of fmboidinate.s, through whose
hands the goods and bills nuM pass on their tedious and
uncertain journey to the Navy agent, and paitially it is the
creation of the very persons who have secured so laige a
slum; of the open putclhises m New York. J know of one
instance m which one of the paity distinctly expressed an
intention of pieventing a competing contiactor from ob-
taining Ins money promptly, and Mieceeded m his effort.
44 The difficulties iccited, and that weie so serious that
other merchants could not successfully encounter them,
wete avoided by Messis. Scofield & Co. in the iollowmg
manner: tirst, by the payment of live oi six hundred dol-
lars to a young man employed in the storekeeper's depart-
ment n  the navy-yard, they scoured immediate attention
to the goods delivered by them, and the piompt passage of
then bills through the official routine. With tho>.o in their
possesion they borrowed iar^esums of money ot the Navy
agent, and lest with bun in many instances their bills as col-
lateial sccutity. They thus had advantages that faner
Uad< is were not possessed of. These facilities they used
with no spanng hand, despite the icinonstrances nude by
the inspectoral the yaid, to the Navy agent; and with the
consequence* of then indulgence you aie familiar.
" Concerning the prices that have been ehaiged foi goods
obtained at open purchase, the only limit that has been
placed upon them is the action and vigilance of the in-
spector at the navy-yard. If it is the theory of the law
and your expectation and belief, that the Navy agent as a
skillful and experienced merchant makes the bin gams as
to the qualities and prices of goods to be bought, then the
Navy agent's definition of his offices and duties is quite
the opposite of that theory, and must disappoint ) oui ex-
pectation. He regards the office as one primarily lor the
disbursement of money, and declares that the immense
increase of business and,the vagueness of the requisitions
made upon him make it absolutely impossible tor him to
make bargains and agreements as to the puces of tilings
before they are delivered to the yard, and lie unhesitatingly
places the responsibility of correctff&s as to quality and
price upon the inspector.
"Practically the only labor performed by the Navy agent in
making the purchases is the mere pending of orders, with
no agreement as to price, to such persons as he may elect,
