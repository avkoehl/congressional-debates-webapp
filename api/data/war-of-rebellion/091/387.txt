Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown:

It is impossible to say how far the road is to be repaired, till we can have an interview with General Sheridan.

Major-General AUGUR,

Rectortown, Va.:

GENERAL: Major Ludlam marches to-night with 150 men. I hope to send him 200 men to-morrow. This will be sufficient to close the river. I am authorized to arm, equip, and mount 200 men of First Delaware Cavalry and the First New Hampshire Cavalry. As soon as I can get these people on the line I will relieve all men belonging to the Cavalry Corps, Army of the Potomac. No organized bands of guerrillas have crossed into Maryland this side of the Monocacy; horse thieves and plunderers have. Ludlam will be able to check this.

Respectfully,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,October 16, 1864.

Major LUDLAM,

Eighth Illinois Cavalry:

MAJOR: The major-general commanding directs that you report without delay to Colonel Gamble, commanding Camp Stoneman, for duty with troops under orders to march to the upper Potomac. Upon assuming command of the detachment, which he will turn over to you, you will move at once to Muddy Branch, or its vicinity, and establish your headquarters and take immediate measures to picket and patrol the Potomac from Great Falls to the mouth of the Monocacy. It is reported that guerrillas and horse-thieves cross the river in considerable numbers. This must be checked. You will be re-enforced as rapidly as the mounting and equipping of troops now at Camp Stoneman will permit. Report by telegraph your arrival at the camp designated and afterward each p.m., by some means, whatever of importance occurs in your command.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General.
