MISSIONARY RIDGE, October 31, 1863.

(Via Charleston.)

His Excellency President DAVIS,

Savannah, Ga.:

Since your dispatches by Colonel Urquhart, the visit of your aide is not so necessary. I shall faithfully endeavor to discharge the difficult and responsible trust with forbearance but firmness. Further correspondence of a more discrespectful and insobordinate character is received from the general. Copies will be sent. It is returned to him, with a copy of your letter, for his reconsideration, and with a hope that he will calmly review his course and withdraw it. General Hardee arrived this morning. The assignment suggested had been anticipated. The Virginia troops will move in the direction indicated as soon as practicable. This will be great relief to me. General Preston was withdrawn without my knolwedge from Southwest Virginia, and before I learned in the route was broken by the enemy. General Jones is now requested to retain him. General Forrest's requests are all granted, and he has started for his new field apparently well satisfied. General Polk's escort ordered to him. All is quiet in front.

The commanding general desire you to withdrawn Anderson's brigade early to-morrow morning to the point where the road reached the top of the mountain, say near Foster's house. It shoudl be there by 10 o'clock, where it will be met by Lieutenant Ferguson, engineer, who will lay off a line of defense for it to fortify. General Anderson should leave for the present some picketing parties on the western trails between the point where he now is and that to which he will be withdrawn.

I am, general, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
