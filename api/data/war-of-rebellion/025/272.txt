You are charged with the enforcement of order, discipline, police regulations, and the preservation of property, both public and private, in the town of Ripley.

Establish police picket guards at the principal entrances of the town, with orders to challenge all persons.

Staff officers and persons mounted or on foot or orderly duty, headquarters dispatch bearers and messengers, and parties on patrol duty and detached service pass in and out by virtue of their orders.

Neither officers, soldiers, nor citizens (except general or staff officers) will be permitted to pass in or out, and all those attempting to do so will be arrested without regard to rank, person, mission, or excuse, and taken to the provost-marshal's office and there detained until their cases can be inquired into. Patrol the town thoroughly and clear it of all our soldiers, arresting every one that is there without a pass signed by a proper officer, and take them to your camp, where they will be held until you have notified the commanding officer of the regiment or company to which they belong that you are directed by major-general commanding to direct them to send a responsible commissioned officer to take charge of them.

All men found with plunder in their possession or in private houses will be separated from the others and immediately tied up and no food furnished them except bread and water. If no rope is to be found, use withers. Report their cases.

When the town has once been cleared and order restored frequent patrols will be sent to arrest such persons as pass into town by other than the principal entrances. The provost-marshal of the army has been directed to order all citizens to immediately report to you all Confederate soldiers at or near their houses, whether disabled or not. You will see those that are well are sent under guard to Crum's Mill, on the Hatchie, thence to be forwarded to Corinth, Miss. A regular descriptive list of the sick will be made, and they will be paroled as prisoners of war, not to bear arms or do anything prejudicial to the interests of the United States Government until regularly exchanged. Your attention is called also to spies, and the major-general commanding hopes that such rigor will be used in their cases as will render it unnecessary for him to be troubled with their examination.

You will be held responsible, and you will hold your officers responsible, that these instructions are enforced in all cases and in the strictest manner.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

Major General U. S. GRANT, Jackson, Tenn.:

DEAR GENERAL: You can well understand how glad I was to hear of the successes about Corinth, Chewalla, and Pocahontas. They have had a wonderful effect here, and the secesh have changed their tone very much. I hear through rebel deserters that the rebel army is at Ripley, and therefore out of reach, for they would scatter and escape if pursued.

A few days since I heard that a party of Partisan Rangers were forming on Wolf River, 6 miles from Germantown. I ordered Grieson, with
