HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 22, 1862.

Colonel STOKES, Nashville:

It is a matter of the greatest importance that I should have a few scouts to use, particularly as couriers, who understand thoroughly the country and roads about McMinnville, Altamont, and Battle Creek, and from here to Nashville. If, as is always to be apprehended, our telegraph communications should be cut off and the road should be more infested with guerrillas, such service would become of vital importance. If you can possibly do it I will thank you to send me about 20 such men by the first train. They will receive liberal extra pay and should be reliable, prudent, and courageous.

General BUELL, Decherd:

I have heard reliably that forage is being collected there in large quantities, My scouts report no force of the enemy on Cumberland Mountains this side of Sequatchie. Morgan day before yesterday was at Hartsville. Johnson is this side of the Cumberland, near Carthage. The troops I sent to his assistance are now at Smithfield. Colonel Grose reports that Morgan is trying to get east, probably to join Forrest, but to do so he will have to march by Johnson or Grose. We have captured two or three small droves of cattle going east. Two men came in yesterday from near Crossville, who report that the enemy's cavalry and some infantry, probably the advance guard, was at Jamestown, Fentress County. The citizens here think that they will advance on Kentucky.

GEO. H. THOMAS.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 22, 1862.

General THOMAS, McMinnville:

Of course you will instantly recall your absent troops. I will probably bring Second Kentucky by rail to march from here, and we will advance to attack in the Sequatchie Valley. I can hardly think the
