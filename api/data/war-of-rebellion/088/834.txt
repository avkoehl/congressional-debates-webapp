The following dispatch is sent for your information:

HALIFAX ROAD SIGNAL STATION, September 15, 1864-10.30 a.m.

Lieutenant-Colonel LOCKE,Assistant Adjutant-General:

At 9 a.m. the enemy's picket-line on the left of railroad was re-enforced by two regiments of infantry from the works along the Boydton plank road. At 9.30 a.m. a four-gun battery passed a point near the junction of the Squirrel Level road with the Boydton plank road, going toward our left. An unusual cloud of dust rising for the last hour on the Boydton plank, half a mile left of lead-works and apparently moving toward the left, indicates a movement of troops or trains in that direction. Yesterday and to day the enemy has been engaged on a new and strong breast-work about a hundred yards in front of their former works, half a mile left of lead-works.

CHAS. L. DAVIS,

Captain, Signal Corps, U. S. Army.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
