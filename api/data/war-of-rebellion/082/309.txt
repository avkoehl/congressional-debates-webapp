General W. T. H. BROOKS:

Kautz has been ordered to report to you with his men dismounted. Sent an aide to notify him to be up in time. Later information by two sets of deserters fixes the point of attack on Meade's left. The enemy in now clearing a ravine there to mass troops. The general commanding directs that you open a furious cannonade on you front and make a feint attack on Foster's front as son as you hear the attack on the left of Meade. Information points to 4 o'clock or daybreak as the time.

Major-General BUTLER:

I sent a company last night under Captain Bell, Twenty-fourth Massachusetts Volunteers, t reconnoiter toward Malvern Hill. He left the river at Maiden Hall Landing; arrived at a point near Pickett's, where he found the enemy. I will forward by orderly his written report.* I think the lines of the enemy extend from Malvern Hill to Chaffin's Bluff, the troops lying along New Market road and toward Malvern Hill.

Respectfully,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.
