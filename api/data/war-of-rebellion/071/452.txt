HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., July 26, 1864-11. 30 a. m.

(Received 12 m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch of 10. 30 a. m. received. Our scouts are out beyond Charleston, and see nothing of the enemy. I do not believe they are going through the Blue Ridge south of this. If they cross into Maryland at all it will be by the upper fords. I am endeavoring to ascertain General Crook's position, and will give him orders according to our directions. We heard firing yesterday afternoon previous to Crook's last dispatch (4 p. m.). From not hearing any to-day we presume he is safely across the Potomac, but will notify you of this in a short time.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., July 26, 1864-3. 30 p. m.

(Received 4 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

Our scouts south of Charlestown report that a portion of the enemy's force is moving toward Snicker's Gap. I will move out in the morning toward Frederick and meet General Wright as he comes from Rockville, bringing, if necessary, Crook's force from South Mountain. I suppose you wish me to leave a sufficient force here to secure Harper's Ferry.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 26, 1864-10 p. m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Harper's Ferry, W. Va.:

It is important that Maryland Heights he held with force enough at least to prevent a coup de main. So long as operating forces are within assisting distance the danger will not be great.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

HARPER'S FERRY, W. VA., July 26, 1864-11 p. m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

General Crook's command is in much better shape than I expected. His infantry generally has behaved well; the cavalry officers miserably. We will move as rapidly as possible toward General Wright.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.
