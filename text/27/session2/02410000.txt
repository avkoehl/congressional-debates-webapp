Tins amendment was discussed by Messrs McROBERTS,
LINN, HUNTINGTON, and MOUTON, and then agreed to.
Mi TAPPAN submitted the following amendment, which,
aftei a few remarks in its support, was agreed to
"That the clerk of the Circuit Court of the United States m
which suits under the act shall be instituted, shall, on the insti
tution-of each suit, inform the Secretary of the Treasury thereof,
and the quantity of lands claimed m the same "
Mr BENTON moved to amend the bid by adding the follow-
ing proviso
"And provided, further, that no claim shall be tried under
this act which haa t>een heretofore re]e. ted by a board of com-
missioners, or wh ch was not duly filed for examination beloie
such Doard, previous to the passage of this act hereby intended
to be revived, or the validity of which has been denied m any
treaty with the powers undei which the claim originated, or
which shall have, be°n reported against by any committee of
Congi ess, and the report concuned in by the House "
Mr BENTON deemed it necessary as a guard against
frauds, &c
Messrs BERRIEN and HENDERSON opposed it because it
wa^ equivalent to a nullification of the bill.

Mr PROri IT a^ifed the veaod.nl inys on the adaption oí
the lesotution   which weie oideied
And the question b^ing about to be takei —
Ms STANLY said that 'f theHou=e refj^ed 1 c^rk to <1 e
committee, they would confer op him, mdm lua'ly, a fivor,
ir.a&nii chas it would save htm a sreat deai oí iaboi *nd leive
him lei-ure to devote w othei things But if the W his partv
intended to íedeem the pledge? *hey had made tothecomtty
tliey couldnotrefu-e the employment of acleiK to enable the
committee to cair> out the ob|ec sof its cieation.
The committee had leceived letters from the Secretary of
War and the Auditor &i staunar that unless the coronet >e
h'idsome one to wnte foi them, the mformatioa sought tould
not b? furnished.
The cemmittee had instructed him unanimously to report the
resolution, (all the members tjeing present but one )
Mr GENTRY approved, he said, of the object which the
gentleman had m view, but he disapproved of one of the senti-
ments he had expressed He, Mr. G thought the gentleman
did not seriously entertain it. He, Mr G had no doubt that
the gentleman desired to see reform and letrenchment intro-
duced into the administration of the Government. That gen-
tlemen knew that many abuses had existed. Tt was the object
of the committee to feuet out these abuses, and they desired a
clerk that they might be enabled to do it. Yet the gentleman
had said that 1 f the House would not allow a clerk he would be
muchgiatified He, Mr G thought the gentleman was mis-
taken m this, that he was sincerely desirous that the proper
and patriotic object Which the committee had in view should
be carried out And such confidence had he, Mr. G in that
gentleman and other members of the committee, and so impor-
tant did he deem it that such investigations should he made,
and that the expo&es to which these investigations must lead
should takeplace, that he regarded it as sound economy as weR
as patriotism to authorize the employment of a clerk. He
hoped the gentleman from North Carolina would retract the
sentiment.
Mr. STANLY expressed hisgratrfication at the opinion which
the gentleman from Tennessee {Mr Gentky] had expressed of
him He, Mr S was tolerably fond of work, arid all he in-
tended to say was, that, by lefusirig a clerk, (ijoat-much as the
investigations of the committee could not be carried on without
one,) the House would leave at his disposal jeisure of which he
could make a most beneficial use for his constituents and for
himself He would, however, accept what the geotleman from
lennes=ee had intimated as a substitute fo\ what lie had said*
Mr CHAULfcS BROWN observed that he had supposed
tl at all this exti wogtince in the public expenditures of the last
Adm nis'ration had been known before the last election* and he
thought the Wh'g paity went beloie the country with such a
{ertain knowledge of tin ir existent e, that they could put their
fingers on ev^ry one of them What did they now hear? Why
after the piesent Administration had been in power almost a
twelve month—after two sessions of Corgi ess, the committee
came before tne House, asking for a clerk to enable them to
feiret oiu abuses sui po«ed to exist. What have all the seven
oreieht committees of the House on the expenditures of the
different departments of the Government been doing? Where
w s the committee of which tne ffenileman from Virginia
[Mr Gilmer] waschairn.an, which was raised for this very
object? Besides titete committees, they had heatdof commis-
sionci'? to t \amineinto the cbusesand coirupuons m the ex-
penditures in the public buildings at Washington, and of the
custom house at New Yoik And yet, now, af'er all the ma-
chineiy had been at work during neatly one whole year, and
embracing rf il\ two session'* of Congress, we are told they
cannot dibcovei ihe conupion and ex'ravagancecharged aa
know agiit^t chelate Admvpb iafu n, unless that one committee
sha^lnveac'^/,. This was truly the mountain in laborpro"
duemgamouse
Weie they to begin to ñiA out ahusesat this late day, when
t' ey were pointed >ut a« certainly existing before 'he elections?
He (Mr ÍÍ > never bf lloved these abuse  to exKf, and since
si ch a lonsr t rre h id e)ap«e 1 since the present Administration
came into powei without then bung able to dibcovei them, he
was the more confirmed n$ that opinion For one, he would
notmcurthe Uí.níCLSSctry expe.se of employing a Clerk, un-
der the vain expec'atioti of findma out bometlung to sanction
the ehaigcs that had be^n made He believed ihat the commit*
teer ti«ed specially for'he put pose was al! su/hcient It was
Mine to economize the expenditures of the Government, for it
was evident they were lunning beyond the revenue; and i( they
did not know that abuses existed, let n^ not, said he, go into a
w ild soo^e cha^e to hunt for them For one he did not believo
th-it any good would come out of the examination, and while
ho would vote foi any and ill c iromittees th tt nught be asked
in-aeirch out the aho^e^ charged, he would not voteasmgle
