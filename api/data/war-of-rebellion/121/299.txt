General BRAXTON BRAGG, Burgaw, N. C.:

What arrangements can you make for the prisoners? If conveyance by rail will interrupt supplies they must march. If sent to Ridgeway, they could march via Clarksville to Danville. Officers should be separated from men.

BURGAW, February 23, 1865-11 a. m.

General R. E. LEE, Army of Northern Virginia:

I am awaiting arrival of Colonel Hatch, who will soon be here to reopen negotiations about prisoners. Will inform you of result. My only action in regard to prisoners has been to keep them in my rear. Any other movements made have been without my knowledge.

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,Via Richmond, February 23, 1865.

General BRAGG:

General Bragg states on 20th General Schofield was instructed to receive prisoners. Would deliver near Wilmington. He thinks instructions may not have reached Schofield when he declined to receive the prisoners. Will repeat the order, and begs that prisoners be not removed from vicinity of Wilmington. General Lee desires, therefore, that they be held at some point convenient for the exchange.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
