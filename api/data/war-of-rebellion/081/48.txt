merely conjecture. When last heard from he was moving on Lynchburg, but if it be true that Breckinridge has moved with a superior force by Orange Court-House on his communications he will hardly be able to reach your army and may be obliged to fall back to Western Virginia. If, however, Sheridan opens communication with him the problem may be changed. In ignorance of what instructions be may have recently received from you I have simply sent him the purport of your telegrams without any orders, leaving him to act as circumstances may arise or as you may have directed. I learn from General Sigel that he [Hunter] has ordered re-enforcements from West Virginia, but Breckinridge may prevent their reaching him. On the whole, I feel, since your last change of base, some apprehension for his safety. But this is one of the usual contingencies of every campaign where forces move on separate and distant lines. As nearly all our resources for supplying the losses of our armies in the field are now exhausted, I have urged the resort to a new draft. I think one will be ordered as soon as Congress repeals the &amp;300 commutation clause. So long as that exists we cannot get men, although a draft would bring some money into the Treasury. I will write you in a day or two on some other matters of importance now under examination in the Executive Bureaus.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
