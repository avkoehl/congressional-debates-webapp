to that effect. Failing in this, I respectfully ask that Company A, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, be placed to the credit of the State of Iowa.

With highest respect, I have the honor to remain, your obedient servant,

Adjutant-General of Iowa.

WASHINGTON, D. C., August 18, 1864.

Adjutant-General BAKER:

Your letter of 12th received. Company A, Eleventh Pennsylvania, has been credit to Iowa. Credit of the three companies Fifth Cavalry to Minnesota must stand.

His Excellency Governor A. G. CURTAIN:

The deduction of Company A, Eleventh Pennsylvania Cavalry, from credit of Pennsylvania was made without my approval. I have this day ordered that the credit be restored.

Governor BROUGH,

Columbus:

The Adjutant-General reports that the last of your 100-days" regiments left her to-day. This, I think, brings the proper time for a suitable official acknowledgment of their services, and it will be given promptly.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

PITTSBURGH, September 9, 1864.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Twenty-one companies have been enlisted and organized for heavy artillery. Orders from your Department directs that twelve form Colonel Gallupe's regiment. Will your order another regiment to be formed? Unless this is done great dissatisfaction will exist here. Give the order, and all will be well. We have succeeded so admirably in arousing the spirit of volunteering in this neighborhood it would be a great misfortune that anything should occur to occasion so great a disappointment as would follow the refusal to receive the companies which have been organized in good faith under a misapprehension by Colonel Gallupe of the extent of his authority. We can complete the additional regiment in two days. We beg to you not to disappoint us in this matter.

THOS. M. HOWE.
