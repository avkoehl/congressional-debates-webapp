Brigadier-General RODDEY,

Commanding Cavalry, &amp; c.:

General Hood directs me to inform you that the enemy have abandoned Pulaski and are going toward Nashville. In two days more he hopes to have the Nashville and Chattanooga Railroad destroyed from Cowan nearly to Nashville. He desires that you will send at once all the force you can spare and destroy the railroad from Decatur to Huntsville and thence to Stevenson. You must judge of what force you will be able to spare from looking after Corinth. You will order Russell's regiment to join the force you send and assist in this work. Do not disturb the road from Decatur toward Athens. Please send forward our telegrams and mails; none have yet reached us.

A. P. MASON,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
