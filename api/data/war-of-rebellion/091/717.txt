HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Kernstown, Va., December 1, 1864-10.30 a. m.

(Received 11 a. m.)

Major General H. H. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The First Division of the Sixth Corps should leave Stephenson's Depot at 11 a. m. to-day. I will very much regret if the promotions which I recommended for October 19 are not made before these troops leave my command.

(Received 12.50 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I have not yet had a report from New Creek. It appears to have been a disgraceful affair. I very much fear that, until all the troops of Western Virginia are sent to points remote from their homes, there will be a recurrence of discreditable conduct.

Major-General.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF WASHINGTON, 22ND ARMY CORPS,Washington, D. C. December 1, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Middle Division:

De Russy reports artillery firing in the direction of Leesburg last night and this morning. Has Merritt artillery with him? I learn this morning that large droves of hogs have been collected by Confederate agents in the vicinity of Upperville. That place should be thoroughly cleaned out. There is a Mr. Dulany living near there (with one eye) that I wish to have arrested and sent to me here. Will you please give such an order.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.
