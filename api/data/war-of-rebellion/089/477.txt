regiments to headquarters Consolidated Brigade will hereafter be made to these headquarters. In assuming command of the old Irish Brigade, it gives me much satisfaction to know that, although fearfully decimated by the casualties of a campaign, in which its officers and soldiers endured, with a cheerfulness unsurpassed, unusual dangers, hardships, and privations, they still maintain their old reputation for bravery and patriotism. The record of the brigade has been a bright one; it had proved its fidelity to the Union by its courage and sacrifices on many a battle-field. Never has a regimental color of that organization graced the halls of its enemies. Let the spirit that animated the officers and men of the present be that which shall strive to emulate the deeds of the old brigade.
