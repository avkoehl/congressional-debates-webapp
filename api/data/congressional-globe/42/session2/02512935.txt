Do not allow the war cry to bb raised as an
argument for high rates of tariff taxation now.
I repeat, the internal taxation pays into the
Treasury $144,000,000 annually. All the inter-
est on the debt and the pensions are paid with-
out the aid of the tariff. It is only required to do
.what it did in 1860—raise the ordinary reve-
nues of the Government. Under that tariff our
manufacturers were amply protected, business
was prosperous, and commerce flourished.
Our flag was on every sea ; we had a tonnage
nearly equal to Great Britain, and greater than
all other nations combined. Now we are hardly
a second-class Power on the sea. In 1860 the
profits made by our own ships in our foreign
trade exceeded those of all other nations
$20,000,000. Now foreign ships in the same
trade make a profit of over $23,000,000 in ex-
cess of ours, as the following table shows :

In short, our commerce, our export trade,
our shipping interests are destroyed—killed
by protection. In 1860 high protection would
have been far more equitable than it is now.
Our industries were more in their infancy (if
indeed they ever mature) than they now are.
Our machinery both in its quality and capacity
has greatly improved. The (so-called) pauper
labor of Europe is now much better paid than
it was twelve years ago ; ever) thing demands
reduction; yet the rapacity of the favored
classes seems to increase not with their neces-
sities or the justice of their demands, but with
their power over Congress and their ability to
make their Representatives obey their orders
or lose their positions.
When the present resistance to reduction is
considered in thelight of the facts and circum-
stances under which protection was increased
to its present proportions, the audacity of the
monopolists becomes unspeakably impudent.
My colleague on the Committee of Ways and
Means [Mr. Burchard] states the facts and
furnishes the proof in a table, which I will
read in preference to stating it myself.
"In 1864, when most of tho present higli duties were
established, the exigencies of the Government to
carry on a gigantio war required revenues to be
raised from every possible source. Internal taxes
were directly assessed upon domestic manufactured
articles, and indirectly by special taxes upon occupa-
tions, and sales, and the means of doing business.
Under the provisions ot internal revenue laws passed
simultaneously with tho tariff of that year, in 1856,
.§234,000,000 were collected from sources of revenue
that have " expired " or will expire at the close of
taw year.
. ' Domestic pig iron paid a ta.x of $2 pet-ton: bar
iron from $2 to $5 per ton: steel from $5 to $12 60
Per ton; textile fabrics and other manufactures,
live per cent, ad valorem. I append a table showing
the internal revenue and compensatory tariff duty.
"Within one yearthis internal taxation was increased
one fifth by the act of March 3,1865:

"These burdensome taxes on American produc-
tions of course were properly compensated by high
rates of duties upon similar imported commodities.
The rates of duties with slight exceptions remain
to-day unchanged. Yet the internal revenue taxa-
tion upon the American product has been wholly
removed."
With what sort of assurance can these peo-
ple ask Congress to continue to impose such
burdens on the people when they were imposed
because of the large sums the manufacturers
were required to pay directly into the Treas-
ury ? Mow when all the, taxes are repealed,
all the burdens removed, when the money
which the Treasury formerly received has for
three years past been transferred to the pock-
ets of the manufacturer, with what reason,
with what sense of decent propriety can he
ask the Representatives of the people to con-
tinue the taxes so imposed upon their con-
stituents? It is simply robbery to do so. I
know of no milder parliamentary term to use
and express my idea of such a course.
While all this is going on, there is no pro-
tection, and can be none, for the great agri-
cultural products, we raise, cotton, tobacco,
wheat, and corn, cheaper than they can be
raised anywhere in the world, and we raise
them in such quantities that we are compelled
to send them to foreign countries in order to
find a market for them ; no tariff laws protect
them after being produced with heavily taxed
implements, by laborers taxed on everything,
and carried on taxed railroads and ships: they
must still be sold in competition with like
products produced by the paupers of Europe.
Cotton and tobacco furnish more than half
our exports. Agricultural products are four
times as large as all the other products of the
country combined. Yetgentlemen prateabout
protecting American industry, when not ex-
ceeding fifteen per cent, of the value of the
protected articles represent labor on an average,
and the protection is wrung out of the sweat
of unprotected industries .Mr. Vvrells says :
A summary statement of the va'ues created by the
leading industries of the country would appear to
he substantially as follows:
Agriculture $3,282,950,000
Cotton manufacture  71.500.000
Woolen manufacture  66.000,000
Iron production, pig and bar  llii.950,000
Leather manufactures    222,6'j0,000
Railway service    360,000,000
Fisheries  100.000,000
Total §4,223,000,000
Mr. Chairman, I suppose everybody knows
rhat a fall of a cent a bushel on wheat or on
a pound of cotton in Liverpool causes a cor-
responding fall in wheat in Chicago and in
cotton in New Orleans the moment the telj-
graph announces the fact; in other words, the
piices of the surplus regulate the prices ot
the crops. Under such circumstances, with
corresponding protection for their products,
beyond the reach or power of Congress, it
seems to me we ought not to hesitate to
reduce theneedless, unjust, and oppressive tax-
ation under which the country is now stagger-
ing, even if a few New England and Pennsyl-
vania manufacturers and their representatives
oppose it, to somewhere about what it was
before it was raised to meet the internal tax-
ation which has been all removed from them.
And if more revenue is needed, in order to
enable the proper reduction of tariff and in-
ternal revenue taxation to be made, restore,
with proper limitations and restrictions, the
income tax, nine tenths of which is paid by
these gentlemen who have been fattening so
long in their extortions upon the poor, on
whom no tax on incomes would be levied. I
confess I opposed the continuance of the in-
come tax when it was first suggested because
1 was not advised of many facts which investi-
gation developed. I learned that the enorm-
ous incomes which this tax would reach
were realized in great part out of the tariff
oppressions of which I have spoken. Out of
the $18,000,000 of revenue collected last year
fiom incomes—
Massachusetts paid   #1,911,808 92
New York paid  7,182,918 60
Pennsylvania paid  2,857,017 11
611,951,744 6S
or about two thirds of the whole ; nearly
double what the other thirty-four States and
all the Territories pa}' from that source, and
I have no doubt three fourths of it has been
paid by the large stockholders in the great
protected monopolies. Will the gentleman
from Pennsylvania and his colleagues tell why
that twelve millions of taxation should cease
while the laborer is taxed forty-eight per cent,
average directly for revenue, and one hundred
per cent, indirectly to create these incomes on
everything he uses from his cradle to his coffin?
No, Mr. Chairman, it is time we were making
weath contribute its proper share of govern-
mental expenses, instead of relieving it from
the small fraction it bears now. It is time
the bounty fed millionaires should be made
to repay some of the bounties which they,
instead of the Government, have received since
the internal taxes were removed to meet which
the tariff was avowedly imposed, and I know
of no better way to do it than to continue tha
tax on their incomes, and relieve labor in
other directions.
Mr. BROOKS, of New York. Mr. Chair-
man, I am abouttopresenttothe committee a
budget, a very dry budget; and perhaps the
only reason why I may claim the attention of
the committee comes not in what I shall say,
but in the tabulated figures which I shall pre-
sent, and which will represent the views of the
three Democratic members on the Committee
of Ways and Means. I do not mean of all
the Democratic members of this House, but
of those three who are their representatives
on the Ways and Means Committee. In April
last, when in feeble health, I made strong
efforts in this House, and particularly called
on the gentlemen on my right hand (the Re-
publican members) to reduce the revenue
then, announcing that there would be at least
one hundred millions of surplus revenue before
we met again, and that if the tariff" were not-
reduced before January, 1873, there would be
at least one hundred and fifty millions of sur-
plus revenue beyond the necessary expendi-
tures of the Government; and I invoked the
dominant party to adopt measures before we
adjourned m April not to permit that taxation
to rest upon the people, certainly for one year,
if not a year and a half. But my invocation,
! deeply regret to say, was all in vain.
Judge then, sir, with what felicity 1 heard
the honorable gentleman from Pennsylvania,
[Mr. Kelley.] who champions the high pro-
tective side of this House, say. but the other
day. these impressive words:
" We ;it'e collecting to-day at the rate of $135,000,-
000 per annum irom internal taxation; we are col-
lecting to-day at the rate ot Sj2o5.0C0.000 from cus-
toms duties per annum; we will have a surplus m
the Treasury of J155 000,000"."
Thus the honorable gentleman from Penn-
sylvania, who seldom or never agrees with mo
