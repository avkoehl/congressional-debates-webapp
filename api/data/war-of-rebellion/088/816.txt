CITY POINT, September 14, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

I shall leave here to-morrow morning for General Sheridan's headquarters. Will be gone five days. General Butler also leaves to-day to be absent a few days. You will, therefore, assume command of all the forces operating in this field if you find it necessary.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., September 14, 1864.

Major General G. G. MEADE:

General Butler reports that the enemy in his front show but little more within their intrenchments than our picket-line. May it not be the enemy are massing everything on their right for an attack? I think it would be well to push reconnaissances, both west and south from our extreme left, to ascertain if any movements are in contemplation. If you have occasion to telegraph me after I start in the morning, dispatches directed to Harper's Ferry will reach me. I shall have a cipher operator along.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, September 14, 1864-8.45 p.m. (Received 9 p.m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch in relation to the thinning of the enemy's line in front of General Butler has been received. The signal officers have reported something of the same kind on my front in the vicinity of the plank road, also the movements of small bodies of the enemy near the lead-works. I will direct Warren to send a reconnaissance out in the morning in a westerly direction, sending with him two regiments of cavalry. Our cavalry is out so far to the south that any advance meets the enemy at once, and they have their cavalry so strongly posted that a mere reconnaissance can not force them back; besides our cavalry is so far in this direction that we ought to have ample warning if our pickets are vigilant. I do not think the enemy will be likely to attack our immediate left or the rear of it, but may, perhaps endeavor to threaten still farther round in the direction of Prince George Court-House, so as to try and draw us away from our intrenched lines. This would be running great risk on their part unless they have a very large force. I will be vigilant and keep a sharp lookout.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, September 14, 1864.

General MEADE:

Telegraph me at Fort Monroe the result of Warren's reconnaissance to-morrow if known by 3 p.m.; if not known until a later hour telegraph to Baltimore.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
