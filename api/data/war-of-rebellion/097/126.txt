whether to make the attack or not. The troops still hold the picket-line taken from the enemy. I will order the disposition for the attack to be made and await the decision of the commanding general of my judgment.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,March 25, 1865-2.50 p. m.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

General Meade desires you to keep up a threatening attitude until night. He leaves it to you entirely to entirely to decide or not we shall attack, and only wishes one to be made to take advantage of discovered weakness.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,March 25, 1865-5 p. m. (Received 7.15 p. m.)

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I think that the enemy is attaching my whole line in strong force. If Wright has any troops to spare he should have them ready to send here. I have telegraphed him.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND CORPS,March 25, 1865-5.25 p. m.

Major-General WEBB, Chief of Staff:

The enemy attacked my right (General Miles' division) at a quarter before 5, heavily. General M. drove them back. He and Mott are so near the enemy's works that they cannot advance without being under heavy five of artillery and infantry from entrenchments. Hays is demonstrating near Hatcher's Run; Mott on the left on his division. We have had sharp firing constantly, they trying to retake their intrenched picket-line without success. They keep up the attack on Miles. One of Griffin's brigades has gone out to his right; the other is just in the rear or Mott's right near the Watkins house.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 25, 1865-6.20 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

The major-general commanding directs me to say to that you are authorized to take any position you may deem most proper with your picket-line. You can either withdraw them or retain your position. If you withdraw you can do it after dark.

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
