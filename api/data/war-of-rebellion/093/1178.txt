Major J. A. CAMPBELL,Assistant Adjutant-General:

The movement of the enemy toward my front is nearer town than by Hughes' Mill-say one mile and a half. It has not yet developed itself into anything more than the appearance of the enemy's infantry in the neighborhood of the river. Citizens say they can cross anywhere. I shall have it watched closely. No enemy yet reported at Hughes' Ford.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
