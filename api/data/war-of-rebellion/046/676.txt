discovered near Fort Moultrie. I opened fire with a 32-pounder rifle, but after 4 shots the fog became so dense os to obscure the fleet from view.

At 7.30 a. m. the fog lifted, and fire was opened upon the monitors at easy range, and continued until they were out of range.

At 8 a. m. ceased firing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BATTERY BEAUREGARD,

August 31, 1863.

SIR: I have the honor to report that yesterday I succeeded in adjusting some pieces of wood under the breech of the Brooke gun at this post, and was enable to fire her with great ease. I fired 37 percussion shells from the Brooke gun at the stockade on Morris Island, and am inclined to believe that most of the shots did good execution. I have only a limited supply of projectiles for the Brooke gun,a nd will be obliged if some more could be furnished. I particularly desire some time-shells, as the percussion does not appear to burst in striking the sand.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. A. HUGUENIN,

Captain, Commanding.

Lieutenant M. KING,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
