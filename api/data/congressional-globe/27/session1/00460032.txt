such haste to repeal, and which they felt dis-
posed to look upon with some favor He
admitted, however, that it was an improvement on
the ¡section, to make a refusal by a depository to
pay over pub'ic moneys in his hands pri na facie
evidence oí the embezzlement of the money. He
thought gentlemen could not but perceive, at everv
step, that they had begun at the wrong end Tie
proceeding threw every body into the most prepos-
terous citcumstances, and ought to be a warning to
gentlemen on the other side to stop where they were
and begin anew. As to the fiscal agent or instru-
ment propoied to be established, which could live
in this District, it could live elsewhere also, for the
same clause of the Constitution which forbade the
establishment of a bank in the District, forbade it in
every fort, dockyard, arsenal, powder-magazine,
ay, and m every Territory, for over all these the
United Sta'es had exclasive jurisdiction. If it
could live in the District, it could live in all these
place*, and the Senate might place such an mstitu-
tion in each one of them and then turn round and
laugh at the Constitution
Mr CALHOUH said that the great difference
between him and Mr. Walker wís, that the latt-r
did not consider a Bank of the United Si? es as the
last alternative to be adopted He viewed the
State Bank system as that last alternative, and in
that opinion the gentleman would stand alone on
that side of the House It was not then surpn mg
that, if the Sub-Treasury must be repealed, that
gentleman, with such feelings, should go lor a
Bank of the United States, rather than for the
State banks
Mr WALKER denied that he had Said that he
would, m any alternative, vote for a Bank of the
United Stites
Mr. CALHOUN reminded him that he had said
there was nothing he would.not prefer to the pet
banks If the Senator did not mean to vote lor a
Bank of the United S a es, why wouid he vo'e to
put the country into a -tale still worse lhan even
that? He (Mr Calhoun) believed that nine-tenths
of ihe peopl of the Unite t States consideied a pet
bank system, if unregulated by law, and subject
only to Executive control, th., very worst pos íble
state of thing . He was, sorry to state that ihe
probability was very great that the Sub T/eisury
law would be repealed If that shou'd take plact,
and the act of 1836 should also be repealed, then
the Senate would be pushed into a plpce where it
must choose between a Bank of the Unite I States
and a pet bank systfm uniegi la ed by liw
Every body kn°w his deep aveision to ths later
of these aliemalives, bat he mus si 11 cons der
a Bank of the Uní e 1 States as more to be depre-
cated It was with him th- last p > sible alternative
He submitted to Mr Walklr wht thi r he Senator
from Kentucky [Mr Cur] was not one «ho mi
derstood the gime he was plaj ir-g, aid si a wi h
great diarreas to what his course would ¡"ad?
That Senator propo ed the repeal of the law of
1836, and «tould the Senator from Mississippi
play into the hand- of one who openly avowed h s
preference for a Bank of the Umt"d S ires' He
would reitera e that the Sent e had bfgun it tne
wrong end The same bill which proposed to ce
stroy the Sub-Trcsury should c< i tain a substi-
tute to be ade p'ed m i roo n Ii fact, the i fa-
culties wer* b coding s^ gr at that gen'lemri

Mr WALKER said that he di I not choos->
either to be misund rstood ot misrepresented by the
Senator fr m South Ca o'ma

tleman did not suspect nm of wilfully misrepre-

CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
stituttonal measure that they would not prefer to
it It had been their curse. It had been es-
tablished in 1834 against his opinions ti e i
openly avowed, for at that time he had stood
alone in the Jackscn Democrats party in Missis
sippi. If not absolutely alone, he had cer-
tainly been nearly so, ?nd so he had stood in 1836,
when he voted against the system, and the Senator
from South Carolina voted for it.
Mr. CALHOUN said that he had unquestiona-
bly preferred a regulated system of State bank de-
posites to a Bdnk of the United States.
Mr WALKER resumed. He did not presume
to say what had influenced the vote of the honora
ble Senator All he said was, that there s'ood that
Senator's vote on record in favor of State banks by
the side of his own vote against h m. His opinion
had then been recorded (although he stood alone
in his party) that ihe Sta'e bank system would ex-
plode. He was now a ked to change his opinion,
but he could not do it He was now asked to vote
for the adoption of this Slate bank syslsm which he
had opposed when adopted, and d«clared it would ex
plode The Senator had said tha he (Mr Walker )
preferred a Bank of the United Stales, but he did
not choose that the Senator from South Carolina
should put words into his mouth which he bad not
used, or alternatives which he had not stated The
Set ator wou'd not permit him to do so himself, nor
eonld he submit to it He had mode no such state-
ment, nor would he consent that it should go out to
the country that he had What he had said was
tins, that he understood the President as condemn-
ing the State b^nk system, and equally condimnins
a Bank of the Unitt d States, and had suggeste 1 as
a substitute for bo b, a fiscal agent \vh eh should not
be a bank, and seemed to prefer i « e Uabli'hment in
the District of C lumhia He had then added tha'
though he preferred th 1 Sub-Treasury to the other
sy tens, yet he would lake such a fiscal acent as
the Ptcsidem recommtnlel in preference to the
State lanhs, and, if the plterna'ive were presented
to him, vould vo'e frr it Beciuse he was op-
posed to a Bank of th United Stites, must he
therefore vote for State banks? Tie was opposed
to them both, and could not vo'e for either. The
Stnatt-r from South Carolina Kid warned > -n that
the motion for a repeal < f the law of 1336 cam 
from a politician who understood hi-, game, and
who was avowedly m lavor of a Bank of the
United States It might be so, jut he (Mr Walk
ek) «ould not on any que tion, much 1 t on a
question of such vital and mighty imr ort «s that >.f
the currency, ask who moved the measure but
what the measure was He shoul' be regulated b/
ihp merits o) ihe motion, and not by the quar'er
from which it proceeder. The Sena'or from Mi

trusted he would noi do, if this act were not forced   I
unon him. As to this regu'ation of the State bank
system under the act of 1836, which the Senator
from Sou h Carolina thought so important, what
was i'? Wh>, first, they must issue no notes under
five dollars, but now the Senator moves to repeal
that restriction, and let them issue one and two
dollar notes Wfeat then remained? Why, little
more than directions to these banks to lean out the
public monsys, which was worse than no regulation
whatever If the President, m any event, puts the
public moneys in the State banks, and loans it out
through them, he must do it without my vote,
but, if I vote to readopt th a State banksystem, I
vote to compel the President to place all these
moneys in these banks and loan it out through
them, and if there be any loss, we must incur the
censure
Mr CLAY said the first question was on the
adoption Df the amendment of ths amendment If
it should be carried, the question would then be on
th- amendment as amended, if negatived, the ques-
fon would next be on his (Mr Clay's) amendment
The question was then taken on Mr Calhoun's
amendment to the amendment of Mr. Clay, and
was decided by yeas and nays, as follows:
YEAS—Messrs Allen, A'cher, Barrow, Benton,
Berrien, Buchanan, Calhoun, Clay cf Alabama,
Fulton, Ker, King, McRoberts, Merrick, Nichol-
son, Pierc , Preston, Rives, Sevier, Smi h of Con-

Henderson, Hunungtoo, Mangum, Miller, More-
hh- d, Pue ps, Porter, Prenti s, Simmons, 6jn,ith
of I idiana, Southard, Tallmadge, Walker, and

So the amendment to tne amendment was
adopted.
The question them recurring on the amendment
as thus ameni ed—
Mr. CLAY ca led for the yeas and nays
It w«s deudid by yeas and nay^, a* follows
