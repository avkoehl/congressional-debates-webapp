by the Legislature, to limit the circulation to a
given amount above the cash on hand, and to re-
port to the country the condition of the banks
Publication ot tins is to be made monthly A
leading bank papei m New Orleans laughs this to
«¡corn, and says that the banks will submit to no
legislative mteilerence with their concerns. The
Legislatuie of Indiana having appointed acommit-
tee to inspect the condition of the State bank, the
board o( directors responded that examinations by
committees of Legislatures are authorized neither
by the charter, by good policy, nor by the interests
of the State."
The contest now between the banks and Govern-
ments, both State and Geneial, is (01 power It is to
aicertam which has got to succumb. It the banks
come off victorious, the people have got to submit to
take and use their spurious money, and make it the
standard of value, though it be ever so < api iciems,
at the pleasure of the banks, and to sun their
interest, without icgard lo the public good If we
are brought to this, it is not difficult to predict the
fate of our boasted land of liberty.
Mr S said the unequal and unjust opeiations of
banking, and from which the great mami tm it
arises, ma^ easily be seen by paving a little allui-
tion to its principles The Legislatuie nicoiporaUs

often the cause of a scarcity in maiket, it would

of this puntapié in a R pub i An (i jvcinmcit wll
be leadny pcccivcd, em adveitnv to ht lad, that
the true depositaries of the political power are the
people, with whom it at all times rests, and by
them can at all times be moulded into seuch
shape as to suit their w ants, and give full scope
tn civil liberty, and to assure its enjoyment
by the citi/en« to the full extent of its capacity

with power from them not to contract away, sell,
and dispose of this power, but to exercise it tem-
porauly during the existence of their agency only
for the benefit of the people, whom they represent.
The Parliament of Great Britain can repeal any
act passed by a preceding Parliament; and whether
the act is public or private, it makes no difference;
it can repeal the one as well as the other; and so a
franchise granted by the King, as all charters of In-
corporation are granted by the King, may at any
time be taken away, or repealed, by the Parlia-
ment. This is admitted by the Supreme Court
of the United States, in the same case tn which
they decide that the Legislature which grants them,
cannot take them away; a passage from which Mr.
S said he would read, from the 4th vol. of Whea-
ton's reports, 643, case of Dartmouth College vs.
Woodward. "According tothe theoryof the British
Constitution, their Parliament is omnipotent. To
annul corpoiate rights might give a shock to pub-
lic opinion, which their Government has chosen to
avoid, but its power is not questioned." A State is
as soveieign and omnipotent as the British Parlia-
ment, except in so fai as its power is taken away
by the National Constitution.
And here two questions arise upon that part of
the Constitution ot the General Government which
piobibiis tht S atts passing any law "impaiting the
obligation of contracts," which, if decided against
the people, gives to the political power of the States
a moie limited and circumscribed operation than
that of Great Britain The fiist question to be de-
cided is, is ihe power exercised by the Legislature,
in passing an act of mcoipoiation and granting
chattered privileges to a company, political power.
The second qneslion is, whelher, if it is political
pow or, a Legislature, as such, has power to con-
tract and grant it away absolutely, and beyond the
contri I of the people, to whom it belongs, and for
«host benefit it was íeseived and kept m store, to
be dealt out and applied as Ihcir necessities should
requite It is admitted by the Supreme Court, m
giving its opinion in the c ase above! alluded to, that,
il it is political power, and exercised as such by the
Legislatuie in making the grant, that it is only an
ext i c ise of sovereign power of tht State, which does
not come within ihe prohibiting clause of the Con-
stitution, and not a contract wilhm the purview of
the Cuii tituiion And, to settle and decide this
question conectly, it becomes necessary to ascer-
tain what political power is
The Court say, in giving their opinion in the be-
fore mentioned case, that, "If the act of meorpoia-
tion be a grant of political power—if it create a
e ivil institution, to be emploved m the admimstra-
t'iii ol the Goveinment, the subject is one in which
the Legislature of the State may act, according lo
il- own judgment, unrestrained by any limita-
tion ol its powers, imposed by the Constitution ot
the United States —4 Whcaton, 630.
Mr S «-aid, with great eleference to the opinion
of ihe Supreme Court, he would ask, m granting a
franchise, what othei power than political does or
cana Lcgislaime expicise1 If it is individual or
personal power, any member of community may
e xi teise if, buta Legislature, as such,cannot Can
a Li gtslature grant a privilege to any individual
lor his sole and onlv benefit, and without being
the lmians of advancing the public interest gene-
r\']y'> No one will be bold enough to assert this.
Will any one pretend that the Legislature has
pow er to grant lo any man a privilege which others
have not, and are not allowed to have, of tilling his
firm in a different and more advantageous manner
Uní olbeis of the same class's And why nof*
Why, bee,mse the power wielded by the Legisla-
nte can only bo exercised for the benefit oí the
pibhc, ind not for the benefit of individuals, and
tins vvou'd ht fi i the benefit of an individual only.
I'm pudieses, tina, which the Legislature is autho-
rized to bestow, aie for the benefit of the public,
the whole people, and not for one or more, to the
exe lusion of the others, except so far as those upon
whom it is conferred may be used as instruments
or agents to promote the public interest. The pub-
lic interest must be the object of it, though indivi-
duals may receive a benefit in the operation, or
else the Legislature possesses no power to bestow
it.   If this doctrine is correct, how can the Legtsla-
