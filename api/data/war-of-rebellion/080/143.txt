General MEADE:

Your dispatch by Captain Jay received. The main body of General Potter's division is beyond the crater. I do not mean to say that my officers and men will not obey my orders to advance. I mean to say that it is very hard to advance to the crest. I have never in any report it not insubordinate I would say that the latter remark of your note was unofficerlike and ungentlemanly.

Respectfully, yours,

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
