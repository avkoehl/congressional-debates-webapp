MOUND CITY, ILL., December 3 [4?], 1864-5 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your confidential dispatch of 11 o'clock yesterday just received. Accept my heartiest thanks for the information given and correction made. I have had night and Sunday work done to get another good iron-clad ready. Hope to see you in a few days. Please instruct operators always to hand you a copy of my dispatches to my officers operating near you. Wishing you the fullest success,

Faithfully, yours,

S. P. LEE.

U. S. STEAMER MOOSE,

Off Nashville, Tenn., December 4, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland, Nashville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: The enemy has heavy batteries on the river at Bell's Mills. I went down last night and engaged them, and had them silenced for a time. Two of my boats passed below them, and are still down the river. It was too dark for us to continue the engagement successfully, there being danger of getting our boats foul and unmanageable. I am going with the other iron-clad to make a reconnaissance in force this morning. From the force that we found last night, the appearance of the batteries, the great number of camp-fires, &amp;c., I am led to believe that Hood's left rests on the river at that point, and that Forrest commands them. Will you please telegraph to Clarksville forbidding steamers coming above that place, and also allow none to leave Nashville for down the river until the batteries are removed. The enemy seems to have a heavy force at this end of his line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LE ROY FITCH,

Lieutenant Commander, Commanding 9th and 10th Dists., Miss. Squadron.

U. S. STEAMER MOOSE,

Cumberland River, December 4, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding Army of the Cumberland, Nashville, Tenn.:

GENERAL: I have cleaned out the rebel battery and recaptured the two steamers captured by the enemy last night, and driven their left flank back from the river at that point, though I do not think it safe for transports to run yet from Clarksville up. I think Forrest commands the left of Hood's army, as General Buford's brigade engaged us last night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

LE ROY FITCH,

Lieutenant Commander, Commanding 9th and 10th Dists., Miss., Squadron.
