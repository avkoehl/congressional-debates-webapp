BENTON [CANTON?], MISS., June 8, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN L. LOGAN,

Clinton, via Osyka:

Your dispatch of yesterday received. You must not come at once to Jackson. You are not wanted there.

On the contrary, you ought not to be driven back by 4,000 Eastern troops. When you find the enemy too strong, fall back only so far as may be necessary, hindering and retarding his advance.

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.
