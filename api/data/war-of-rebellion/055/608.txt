pletely surprising the enemy, killing and wounding a number and capturing the remainder.

During this charge the Thirteenth Illinois captured the battle-flag of the Eighteenth Alabama Regiment,* and the battalion of my brigade, composed of the Thirty-second and Twenty-ninth Missouri Volunteers, captured one piece of artillery, with horses and cannoneers. The number of small-arms captured will probably be over 1,000. During this day every officer and man did his duty.

On the 26th, my brigade had the rear of Major-General Hooker's column. One regiment, the Thirty-second Missouri, was left on Missionary Ridge to collect and turn over to the ordnance officer the small-arms captured. The Twenty-seventh Missouri was left at the crossing of the Chickamauga to protect the bridge. Nothing of note occurred during this day's march.

On the 27th, this brigade had the advance of Major-General Hooker's column and moved on Ringgold, Ga. We found the enemy strongly posted in a gap on the mountain and occupying the slopes and summits on either side in our front. As soon as the proper dispositions could be made, I sent forward the Seventeenth and Thirty-first Missouri as skirmishers. They moved forward across the open fields to the timber at the foot of the slope of the mountains, but were soon severely pressed by the enemy's skirmishers. I sent immediately forward the Twenty-ninth Missouri to support them, but the whole line of skirmishers and support was driven back upon the main line in confusion, and were not again entirely rallied until after the enemy retired. Shortly after forming the line, I pressed forward the Thirteenth Illinois on the extreme right to some houses within 100 yards of the enemy's artillery. Before this the Seventy-sixth Ohio was sent up the slope of the mountain well on the left. The Twelfth and Third Missouri occupied the center. The fighting on the extreme right was severe, the Thirteenth Illinois firing 100 rounds of cartridges per man, besides taking all the ammunition from their killed and wounded in order to hold their position. The Twelfth Missouri, although exposed to a severe fire, held its position with undaunted courage. The Seventy-sixth Ohio, after gaining the crest of the hill, held it against superior numbers, who poured in a withering fire from the front and both flanks. The regiment held the crest until 8 color bearers were either killed or wounded, when it fell back, fighting and in good order, to a sheltered position under the crest of the hill, where it remained, holding the enemy in check, until the fighting was over.

I inclose the report of Colonel J. A. Williamson, commanding the Second Brigade, of First Division, Fifteenth Army Corps, in reference to the action of the Seventy-sixth Ohio, he being near with a part of his command; also the report of Major Willard Warner, commanding the Seventy-sixth Ohio Volunteers, concerning the part taken in this action by that regiment.

I am glad to be able to speak most approvingly of the conduct of the officers generally of my command during the operations of the 24th, 25th, and 27th of November. They evinced the greatest alacrity in carrying out all orders, frequently in circumstances of great exposure and danger.

The mention of the names of some is proper, and I designate the
