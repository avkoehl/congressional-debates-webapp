million dollars as her distributive share, besides
a large «ddmonal donation of land, creating á
fund which would have been amply sufficient, had
the policy been continued, to educate every child
jn the State, and pay the taxes of the people for
ages, besides aiding greatly in our works of
internal improvement. It will be recollected
{hat we had in the West a doetune, at one time
called the eminent-domain doctrine; a kind of
South Carolina doctrine, under which some of
our politicians claimed the whole of the public-
lands within the States, by virtue of our State
sovereignty. 1 say, you cannot have forgotten
that such was the claim set up by some of our
western politicians; as for myself, I could not
bring my mind to the conclusion that the claim
was more than plausible, if even so much. But,
sir, the friends of that measure exhibited to the
people the great advantages which would result to
the new States, should it succeed, by making the
whole of the public domain within their limits a
fund for the education of the youth, the support of
the State governments without a resort to tax-
ation, and in aiding them with their works of in-
ternal improvement. All this was admitted, but
then came the compacts, the deeds, and objects
of cession, the means and treasure employed in
their acquisition, as barriers to the realization of
the fondly-cherished hopes of our eminent-do-
main men, and for several years we have heard
nothing on the subject. But, sir, my object at
this moment is not to censure those who believed
in the eminent-domain doctrines, but to say to
them, as Well as the Senate, that the land bill of
which I have been speaking was infinitely moro
advantageous to the new States than their favor-
ite policy In the one case, your claim ended
with the appropriation of the lands lying within
your limits, the best of which had been culled
and sold by the Genernl Government; and m the
other, as proposed by the bill, you leceived one
eighth of that sum, with the additional grants of
land proposed in the bill, of the lands lying with-
in the limits of your State, and then received yom
equal shaie of the proceeds of the residue in the
respective States and Territories, besides your
equal proportion, accoiding to your Federal rep-
resentation, of the proceeds of the seven bundled
and fifty million acres that he beyond the States
and Teintones. I therefore repeat, that the
amount to be received under the provisions of the
distributive land bill of the Senator from Ken-
tucky, by the new States, would have been infi-
nitely more beneficial to them than a grant at that
time of all the lands within their limits, in a pe-
cuniary point of view
But, sir, there is another view which struck my
mind as being entitled to great weight in the de-
cision of that question—I mean its nationality It
has been said by the wisest and greatest men, and
I believe truly said, that it is not themeie paich-
ment scroll, called a Constitution, that binds the
people of this great nation togethei, but an equal-
ity of rights and a community of inteiests, and
should this equality or that community be dc-
sttoyed, as was that between the mother coun-
try and the colonies, should theGoidian knot be
cut or untied, it will be precisely the same in its
results—equally disastrous to the people That
is, therefore, wise legislation which stiengthens
these ligaments of equality and inteiest which
bind us together as a nation And it does seem
to me, sir, that the tendency of the land bill was
to produce that happy effect The Senator fiom
Mississippi will theie'bie pardon me if I cannot,
with him, see in this great measure of the Sena-
tor from Kentucky hostility to the best interest
of the West, nor do I believe that a majority of
the people of the West so view it
I come now briefly to examine another of the
favoute measures of the Senatoi from Kentucky.
I allude to the act to distubute the suiplus leve-
nue I have heard that measure denounced on
this floor in no measured terms, as being hostile
to the interest of the West—not specially by the
Senator from Mississippi, but by otheis It is
highly probable, however, that this measure, in
the eyes of that Senator, forms one of the hostile
acts of the Senator from Kentucky I piopose,
therefore, to examine it very briefly, and to show
that such was not its operation What was the
state of the case before Congiess and the country
AboUüéi Petitions—Mr. Clay.
at the time of the passage*of that act > Why, sir,
the national debt Was paid, and it was obvious
that a large surplus of public money would re-
mam in the Treasury after the payment of the
usual expenses of the Government. The question
then aiose as to the proper disposition of these
surplus funds.   The Senator from Missouri {Mr.
Benton] proposed to enter upon a giand system
of fortifications, the construction of which would
have absorbed the whole of the surplus, and still
have required as much more to complete and arm
them, without any corresponding benefit what-
ever to the country    This project had but few
adherents, and its rival measure, the distribution
of the surplus amongst the States accoiding to
their Federal representation, was warmly advo-
cated by the Senator fiom Kentucky and others,
and became a law.   By this law, the money that
had been drawn from the pockets of the people,
principally from the extra sales of the public lands,
was returned again to them or to the States, to
be appropriated for their use    It is very true, sir,
but three of the installments have been received
by the States, and it is due to candor to say that
I consider the matter settled here that the States
are to receive no more, and that the Government
is to view the amount received by the States asa j
donation or gift to them not to be returned    So 1 ,
presume this maUer will end. The States having I
received the thieeinstallments, weie clearly bene- |
fited to that amount, while the counter project, |
the fortification system, would have been bene- l
ficial to no person, except perhaps the contract
ora   Between these modes of disposing of the sui-
plus revenue, it seems to me 1 could not have
hesitated; nor can I view the support given to the j
distribution act by the Senator from Kmtucky as
hostile to the interest of the West, b it, on the ,
contrary, highly beneficial  to  that section of '
country.                                                                        i
Sir, the support gtven by the Senator fi om Ken- '
tucky to the protective system in days gone by
has been again and again referred to by the Sen-
ator from Mississippi as hostile to the western
mteiest     It is not to be denied by me that the
Senator fiom Kentucky has been the advócate of
the protective system, or, in other words, the ,
protection of American  industry against a too  I
powerful foreign competition, by duties on the  j
importation of the foieign article     I feel no dis- I
position to revive the aigument on tins question,  |
much may be said on both sides of ii     It has  i
always appealed  to me that, as we deuve oui   ¡
levenup to support and cairy on the operations
of the Government fiom our imposts, it was but
right and proper to confine those duties to arti-
cles which could be manufactured in the United
States in sufficient quantities to supply the de- ¡
mand, and thereby make the taufffor piotection 1
and revenue identical     In this light, no one at
this day denies the power or duty of the Govern-
ment to lay protective duties, by whatever name
they may be called    The West, so far as I ever
heard, was favoiable to protecting our own m-
dustiy    The President of the United States voted
for the taufTof 1828, which was the highest pro-
tective tariff evei laid m the United States, and
yet I have never heard him censuied for it in the
West     No, sn, we believe  in a pioper tariff,
making revenue and protection mean  the same
thing, anil confining the duties, where there can
be no protection, to articles of luxuiy—such ar-
ticles as mimstei  only to the vanity and extiav-
agance of life—while we would wholly remove
it fiom the necessaries of life, in daily and com-
mon use by all classes of the people     I am not
pieparcd   o admit that the Senator fiom Ken-
tucky has shown hostility to the West in advo-
cating the protective system     I might trace the
Senator from  Kentucky through a long, labou-
ous, and valuable life, (for he  has traveled  the
highways on all impoitant subjects,) would time
peimit, and I feel veiy confident that the evi-
dence would still stiengthen the defense, and tend
even further to remove all piobable cause for the
charge of the  Senator from Mississippi, but I
feel that it is useless     Sir, I have seen the Sen
ator from Kentucky the groat pacificator on the
Missouri, and other questions that were lorkin?
the Republic to its center, not for the benefit of
the West alone, but for the Union—the whole
Union.
Senate.
There is one other great measure, Mr Presi-
dent, to which 1 presume the Senator from M is-
sissippi points, to show the hostility of the Sen-
ator from Kentucky to the West. 1 allude to the
bill which passed the Senate at the last session,
and fell in the House, known as the sub-Ti easury
bill. I do not piopose, sir, to revive the debate
on that measuie at this time; it will probably
come up again ere long, and a  I have on two
former occasions given my opinions on it some-
what at large, coneurung with the Senator from
Kentucky, it is not to "be expected that I can see
in an opposition to that measure hostility to the
West; far from it. I have satd that the great
desideratum in the West was capital and ciedit;
the one sufficient to form a just and safe basement
for the other to rest upon, and any measure that
reduces the one or destroys the other is injuuous
to the West It is true, an exclusive specie cir-
culation, divorce of the Government from the
banks,collect and disbuise the revenues in every
part of the countiy in gold and silver by the offi-
cers of Government without the aid of banks,
aie not unpleasant sounds to the ear, but, in my
humble opinion, it is m theory only that they
may be tolerated, for then leason is left fiee to
combat them. In piactice, I have shown their
operation, at laige, on foimer occasions, and full
and matine reflection has only confiimed the
opinions I then expressed I believe the whole
measure, in practice, would be injurious to the
nation, and especially to the West
Mr. Piesident, the remarks which I have sub-
mitted, connected with the measures which have
been supported by the Senator fiom Kentucky,
have been entirely defensive I have not attempt-
ed to show who are not the fnends of the West,
who have, oi who have not, sustained those great
western measures to which I have alluded. My
object was not to criminate or to make charges,
but to show some of the evidence which had op-
erated on my mind, creating the belief that the
Senator from K( ntucky was not an enemy to the
West, and now let me say to the Senator, I do
not believe one word of his charge The Senator
from Kentucky an enemy to the West' Impos-
sible ' If no one act of his long and useful Ufe
proved the contrary, his position foibids it No
man, sir, can be an enemy to the West who le-
sidos thcie, whose private interest, whose family
and fnends aie there, even should his philanthro-
py embiace the whole human family, still the
country of his home must necessauly picdomi-
nate in his affections I would as soon believe
that my worthy colleague, [Mr Tipton,] who
fought side by side with the brave and lamented
Speneei nubat bloody conflictatTippecanoe, and
who has rendeied his State and the West such
valuable services since he has been a membir of
this body, is an enemy of the West The Sena-
tor from Kentucky an enemy to the West1 I
would as soon believe that charge against you,
Mi President, who have stood by the West m
all her great measures, you who poured out your
blood like watei in defense of the western frontiei;
impossible—impossible, sn The Senator fiom
Kentucky an enemy of the West1 Satisfy me
that the hero of Tippecanoe, the patriotic, the
gallant, the distinguished Harrison, who penled
hislifeagamand againfor the West and hiscoun-
ti y, and whose long and valuable life has been
identified with hei interest and glory, is hostile to
the West, and you may make mo, believe the
charire against the Senator from Kentucky. Fiat
