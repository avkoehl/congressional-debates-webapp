SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 30, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK,

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

Will accepting De Bolt's regiment compromise the raising the two regiments already called? Answer carefully. Where are all the guerrillas?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, August 30, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Saint Louis:

I will be better prepared to answer the interrogatory touching the De Bolt regiment to-morrow morning. The guerrillas are being re-enforced by the young rebels who are fleeing from the draft. We are chasing the rascals with all the mounted men we can raise; have killed 27 bushwacker within the last six days; every one counts. Doctor Walker, a rebel of Platte County, was killed near his own house on the 28th instant. His neighbors all agree in the opinion that his death was caused by an old feud, antedating the war even.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., August 30, 1864.

General FISK:

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

Douglass, who telegraphs for a co-operating force from this side to clean out some bands of guerrillas in Boone County, has been directed to communicate with you. Give the force he wishes to send out and that required from this side. Fix times and places of crossing and have guides ready at the proper points. This must be done with great secrecy and promptness. Let me know the present condition of the recruits.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SAINT JOSEPH, MO., August 30, 1864.

Colonel O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

A portion of the new regiments now organizing should be mounted forthwith and sent against the guerrillas. The major-general commanding advises me by telegraph that the men could furnish their won horses and the Government would purchase them at appraisal status. I have the honor to request definite instructions as to horses and horse equipments as early as practicable. The approaching draft is rapidly re-enforcing the enemy in the brush in nearly all the river counties. The withdrawal of the First Iowa Cavalry veterans be seriously felt in the district. We shall have men enough this week, but must mount a portion without delay.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.
