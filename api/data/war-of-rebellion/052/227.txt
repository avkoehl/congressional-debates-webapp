that the Confederate soldiers must have some uniform distinct from the dress of the citizens, or else be treated as spies and guerrillas.
This is a good time for you to go to New Orleans. Please say to General Banks that I regret that I have never met him. He and my brother John are strong friends, and I hope to meet him at some future time. When events are further advanced I might be of good service on Red River, where I have a large and influential acquaintance. Judge Boyce, of Rapidese, should be won over to our cause as soon as possible. Give my special regards to Generals Stone and Franklin. We begin division drills immediately after muster, and I will keep my corps well in hand.

Flag of truce is in. I have Mobile papers to the 28th, but have not read them yet.

General RAWLINS,

Vicksburg:

Flag of truce came in late last night. Nothing important. They described things status quo at Chattanooga and Charleston. They say they have received two very heavy Blakely guns, which are now mounted in position against the iron-clads. They assert that the Confederates still hold Fort Sumter.

CONFIDENTIAL.] SHERMAN'S HEADQUARTERS,

August 30, 1863.

General RAWLINS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel McConnell, Fifth Illinois Cavalry, late major of the Third Illinois Cavalry, has reported for muster in. His regiment is below the minimum, and he is not fairly entitled to mustering, except on the theory that he was actually commissioned prior to the receipt of the order. I don't want any colonels unless they are super extra. Do you know Colonel McConnell? Is he such an officer that we should strain the order to accept him? Unless he is far superior to other colonels, I prefer to get along with majors and captains to command.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
