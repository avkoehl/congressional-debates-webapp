Mr LINN observed thatbeforeproceeding any furíh^i, he
would pro* ose an amendment to the bdl It is, to strike out
from the sixtu and seventh lines the words that 'the Pies dent
of the United ¡sta'estake possession of the temtory bordering
on the Pacific O ean, and " ife had, on consultation with some
of the gentlemen of the Señale, concurred with them in the sug
festmn that it might not at this time be proper to require the
'resident to take poaseosion of all the taintory to which the
United States may h tve a disputed claim The amendment
would, however, rendei the bill unobjectionable in that re-
spect
The question was then taken on the amendment, and it was
adopte J

The Chairman Does ths gentleman from Massachusetts

Mr Adams Oh yes, the gentleman may explain as much
as he pleases
Mi JfcGEKSOLL, (much excited ) I do not rise to explain;—
do not want to explain,—but to íepel and retort the blackguard-
ism of the membei from Massachusetts,—his blackguard at-
tack on those I represent and his association of my pe son with
infamous places which he may haunt himself, as the poetry of
his tormer life would írfer, but to which Í am an en are stran-
ger Such foul malignancy mentsa full chaiged reply, which,
now, I am not peimitted to administer I confine myself to
stating, therefore, what he dare not deny—that, when a candidate
forthePicbidency, and seeking it by base couitahip, he de
gi a/led the high rlace of Secretary of State by delivering a
Fourth of July oration in this Hall, flounting in a black gown,
m which he pandered to his supposititious aveision of Amer*
cans to Englishmen, and solicited vile popularuy by such inde-
cent attacks on England, and, above all «uch brutal mention of
the in<anuy of an English monaich, (then lately dead,) as ex-
cite 1 universal thsgubt, and caused all Americans in England to
blush for their Secretary of State and Presidential candidate
So much lor his sympathy with Londoners, and hypocrite

con emp ible dread ofEngh h power and paltry colonial mis-
trust ol his own court ty to resist it, together with ingrain
veneiation of Eurof ean high wrought Governments in prefer-
ence to his < wn, of which he was long an unworthy pensioner,
I shall ad 1 from memoiy, the veiy wouls I believe, of a letter
he mailed from Ghent for An enea, while intrusted by the
United States with the negotiator of peace Afier various
d dances ovei our helpless condition, this letter added, in pi*
ecrable apprehension,' \\ ith thiee frigates for a navy, and five
regiments for an aimy, whs  t can we expect but defeat anddis-
errace'i" Such were his five points' Such his confidence in
his coantiy, which, wi hout inordinate pay for constructive
journeys that 1 rodigious patriot was not at ah fond of serving

of his speech, and ob-erved that it might have proceeded from

has himself to thank for it

But, to tuiu from this subject to «hat, perhaps, more pro
perly belongs to the discifssion? and adverting to the powerful
argument made by the gentleman yesterday, m which he made
such anexeflt ng, such a triumphant use of a pamphlet put forth
by our Mimstei to Frarce and pronounced such lofty encomi
urns on the ctrrespondenceofour lateMinister to tne Court of
St James, which was let offhke a Paithean shaft, when he was
just about to fly—asnaft which heletoffjust after he fad given
his admom ion to our commander that it was time to get nearer
hon e, the couiage anil spirit of which the honorable gentle-
man so warmly admired, though darted at the Biitish Minister
at the very moment he who sent it was on the point of depar-
ture to getout of haim's way himself In commenting on the
pamphlet of Gen Cass, („f whom I shall always speak with
loe re^pt-ct and honor ) I said that the very fart for which the
gentteman so much admired it excited any thing but admiration
m me because I considered it as an interference with the inter-
ml affursof France, under color of sounding the tocsin of
alarm aarainst a concession of the right of search I eajd it wa?,
in fact, a tocsin peainst the crown of Loins Philippe, and that,
if its effect should be to produce a war between France and the

the false pietenceof objecting to the right of search, we should
find ourselves totally deceived for f hat the light o*- search was
