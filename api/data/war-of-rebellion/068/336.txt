HEADQUARTERS SECOND DIVISION,May 2, 1864.

A disturbance took place yesterday morning in the Eighth Ohio Volunteers. Measures were at once taken by Colonel Carroll to suppress it, and 12 of the ring-leaders were placed in irons. Every man has now returned to duty; a more healthy state of feeling exists, and no further trouble is anticipated. In case of such, however, I have directed that any man refusing to do duty will be shot on the spot.

Respectfully,

JOHN GIBON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division

GENERAL ORDERS, HDQRS DIV., SECOND CORPS, Numbers 25. May 2, 1864.

In compliance with orders from superior headquarters, I relinquish the command of this division. In doing so I take the occasion to express my gratification that I am to be succeeded by an old and tried soldier, Brigadier General Geshom Mott. My connection with this division for the past two years has been of the most pleasing character the recollection of which time can never obliterate. I leave you with the very best wishes for your success and prosperity, believing that under command of Generals Meade, Hancock, and Mot, you will retain the world-wide reputation you have so nobly won on many hard-fought battle-fields.

JOS. B. CARR,

Brigadier-General.
