Sir: It is my painful duty to roportto you the
sinking of tho United States steamer Oneida by col-
liding with the Peninsula and Oriental Company's
mail steamer Bombay, in Yokohama bay, on the
night of the 24th instant. The Oneida left this har-
bor, bound to Hong Kong, about five p. m. of that
day, and when near Saratoga spit was struck by this
steamer, then arriving from Hong Kong. Tho Onoida
was struck just forward of her starboard miizen rig-
ging, carrying away tho whole of the starboard quar-
ter, wheol, and all steering gear, and sank, so tar as
I have been able to learn, in about fifteen minutes
after tho collision. Pour officers and fifty-soven men
were saved in two boats. I respectfully inclose a
list of those saved, and a list of those lost, so far as I
can ascertain from tho surviving officers and men.
I hare already communicated the sad intelligence
to Boar Admiral Rowan, now at Hong Kong. I avail
myself of tho opportunity to forward this by the
American sailing bark Benefactress, which vessel :
sailsto-morrow t'orSau Francisco. The Pacific mail i
is now over due from San Francisco and so steamer j
will sail for that port till about tho 22d instant. |
I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
H. B. MULLAN.
