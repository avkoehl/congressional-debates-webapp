additional calls on the salve force of the country, so much needed in the agricultural operations of the apporaching season, I respectfully suggest that a requisition, suitably approtioned, be made on the freenegro population of the counties and corporations not heretofore called on. A requisition of this kind is authorized by an act of the Virginia Legislature, passed Febraury 12, 1863, "to amed and re-enact and ordinance to provide for the enrollment and employment of free negroes in the publict service, passed by the convention July 1, 1861". In accordance with the second section of this act, which directs "that upon the requisition of the commanding officer of any post or department of the State or Confederate forces for labor in erecting batteries, intrenchments, or other necessities of the military service, addressed to the presiding justice of any county, or mayor or senior alderman of any corporation as aforesaid proceed forthwith", &amp;c. I inclose for your signature drefts of requisitions* on twenty-four counties and corporations for tree-negro labor. The act prscribes that pay and term of service. Should these papers meet your approval you are respectfully requested to sign them, and if returned to this bureau they will be issued to the respectiv presidings justices and mayors.
