in its nature to that adopted for the government of the Orleans Territory by the act of March 26, 1804, seems to be much better adapted, at least for the present, to this Territory; and its extent of surface is so great that Congress may, perhaps, deem it proper further to imitate the example set in the act above recited by dividing it into two governments.

Second. At the first session of the Congress an act was passed providing for the sending of a commissioner to the Indian tribes north of Texas and west of Arkansas, with the view of making such arrangements for an alliance with and the protection of the Indians as were rendered necessary by the disruption of the Union and our natural succession to the rights and duties of the United States, so far as these Indians were concerned. The supervision of this important branch of administrative duty was confided to the State Department, by which Brigadier Gen. Albert Pike was selected as commissioner. At a later period of the same session a Bureau of Indian Affairs was created by law and attached to this Department, charged with the management of our relations with the Indian tribes. The correspondence of this Department and the report of General Pike exhibit full proof of the zeal, energy, and fidelity with which he conducted his arduous mission and the success with which it was crowned. He has made treaties with the entire Indian population of the Territory in question; has secured their alliance; has enlisted several regiments of their warriors in our service, and has shown a rare and admirable combination of the qualities chiefly required for success in such a mission, namely, sympathy and friendship for the Indians, blended with devotion to the interests of his Government. These treaties, coupled with the report of General Pike, will form the subject of a special communication to Congress, and I now submit only the report of the head of the bureau in this Department, containing a su of the entire administration of Indian affairs from the establishment of the bureau to the present date.

Third. The operations of the Army since the adjournment of Congress, on August 31, afford renewed cause of congratulation, of gratitude to Divine Providence, and of admiration for the gallant defenders of our righteous cause. Successful in a large number of minor engagements, signal victories have crowned their arms at Leesburg and Belmont. I regret that, for some unexplained reason, the report of the former of these two brilliant achievements has not yet reached the Department, but I append full reports of the latter. * You will also find annexed reports of the less important, though not less gallant and meritorious, affairs at Lewinsville, under command of Colonel (now Brigadier-General) Stuart; # and at Piketon, of Captains May, decisive repulses of the enemy in his attacks on the forces at Greenbrier River, under Brigadier Gen. Henry R. Jackson, and on the army of General Floyd at Carnifix Ferry, merit conspicuous mention, while the more recent lesson administered to the insolent invaders of our soil by Major-General Bragg and his brave army at Pensacola affords ample evidence of the power of well-served and properly protected batteries to resist successfully the attack of the most formidable vessels of the hostile Navy.
