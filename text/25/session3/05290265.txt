25th Cong....3d Sess.
Lands in Tennessee^—Mr. Foster.
Senate,
which way you please, presents to the eye an un-
bioken suifacc, occasionally diversified with gen-
tle undulations, but nowheie risyig into hills and
piecipices The avers and smaller water courses
—nanow, deep, serpentine, and sluggish—flood-
ing for ages then neigliboimg bottoms, havecie-
ated great and extensive swamps and marshy
lowlands which the wants and the enterprise of
a scoie of generations to come will not be likely
to íeclaim in other respects, nature appears to
have dealt out het bounties with a paitial hand
Throughout half, or more, of this fine countiy,
the soil, sufficiently deep and based upon a clay
foundation, throws upwaidsfiom us virgin bosom
a rich and luxuuant variety of forest growth, and
rewards the labors of the plow with an abundant
haivest And here it is that wealth has found its
pleasant home, and, leposmg on its own good
fortune, can have no mteiest beyond ageneious
hope in the fate of this important measure
But, as if to heighten efii ct, by the suddenness
and rapidity of the change, heie more than any-
wheie 'else, we are fiequently doomed, in one
short day's journey, to contrast the extremes of
barrenness and feitihty Lights and shadows,
alternately flitting befoie the eye, expose, in the
gieat variety of soil, a checkered panorama, and
gioup before us the rich man 's ample possessions,
and the humble, but hopeful, abode of the mdus
tnous occupant A little further on, and humility
enjoys its own undistuibed dominion There aie
Hijre coterminous tracts of countiy too steille
01 too unfiuitful for the cupidity of the land war
rant, and yet good enough foi the poor man's
refuge And here, sn—heie, amid extensive
banen wastes, clothed with a stunted growth of
wood and verduie—here, retiring poverty has
found a thousand " little islands" of fertile soil,
small, Mi Piesident, they aie, but sufficiently
laige to encourage the mdustiy, reward the toil,
and suppoit the rising household of the humble,
but thufty, adventureis who have seaiched out
and seized upon them
Such, Mr Piesident, are the geographical out
lines of the "congressional reservation," and
such the character and condition of the vacant
and unappropriated lands upon which the bill be-
fore you proposes to operate What considera-
tions ca,n there be of policy and humanity opposed
to its passage' In either point of view,I boldly
and confidently avow it, the reasons arc, all of
them, on the side of the measure Neaily fifty
yeais have elapsed since North Caiolma con
veyed this country to the United States, and
within that period Congress has purchased, paid
for, resold, and given away an empire of lands
States and Territories have been peopled around
her, until Tennessee, then the most distant fion
tier of the inhabited Union, is now, in the maich
of great events, the center, if not the very center,
of our gieat sacial system To this good day,
no attempts h * been made, direct or indnect, to
exercise any Federal supervision over these lands,
and but for the reminiscences yearly biought
up here by the supplicating occupants and their
faithful advocates, you would long since have
forgotten your paltry interest in this broken in-
heritance You are reminded of it this day, sir,
only 'o be convinced by evidences as " strong as
proof of Holy Writ," that any effort on your pait
to reach the property by the only mode known
to your statutes will involve an expense far ex-
ceeding the whole value of the estate In the
absence of all positive testimony, the system of
appropnating the public lands in Tennessee, as
already described, abundantly establishes this
important fact
The land warrant, as before observed, was a
written bond on the State for its amount in tillable
acres And when hundreds and thousands were
daily and for years in the race, every man his
own unbridled piovider, could it have been othei-
wise ? Land hunting soon became a distinct and
profitable profession Hence, sn, in the legal
vocabulary of the day, the land " locator" was as
familiarly known by his name as the attorney and
cleik of the couit by then respective titlts It
was the business of this active undertaker to tra
verse the countiy in every dnection, and to scan,
with piacticed eye, all the advantages of watei,
soil, and situation As the quantity of good lands
diminished, the field of his less successful labor
expanded The most unfrequented woods were
examined, and the tops of the hills and the mount-
ains, with their deepest goiges, were exploted.
The information thus acquired became the mer-
chandise of this agrarian biokcr, and its rapid
demand, at the highest puces, by the owners of
land warrants, seldom failed to ennch the shiewd
and fiu°-al " locator " Nowhere was this system
earned to such high perfection as it was in the
"congressional rebervation " Long before the
land offices weie opened in that district, numeious
detachments of uval land hunters, headed by
vetcian chiefs, broke into the silence of the then
unsettled wilderness, and scorned the countiy to ¡
eveiy point of the compass Some of them, moie
skillful and lynx eyed than otheis,are said to have
mapped out and centeied the piincipal counties,
as they weie subsequently established by the
Legislature Ceitain it is the piepaiations were
so admn ably completed that, when the anxious
day arnved, an "avalanche" of warrants was
piecipitated upon the country, and covered every-
where, in wild confusion, the " fat of the land "
Fiom that hour to this, now eighteen consecutive
years, with slight intermissions, the fieice havoc
has been constantly kept up Wanants have been
divided, and again subdivided, and so caiefully
fitted, squared, and dovetailed, as to reach almost
eveiy acre of valuable arable land woith the price
of the mstiument, without including the woith-
less adjacent soil Sir, on the statement and au-
thonty of an honorable gentleman, once a suivevor
in the countiy, and a man of unimpeachable
veracity, I submit to the Senate that, in the prog-
ress of this searching system, "thcie are hun-
dí eds, and perhaps thousands of tracts of land in
the ' congiessional leservation'havingfrom twen-
ty to forty coméis and offsets "
Mr President, if my story be true, can it be
that policy or cupidity would insist on a suivey
and sale of the public domain in Tennessee' But
I desne to satisfy everybody, and happily, in the
documentary proofs before me, and in other evi-
dences now on my table, I have it in my power
to throw a flood of light on the subject, which
must convince mcieduhty itself
Sir, nineteen years ago, my State caused the
"congressional reservation" to be divided into
seven districts, numbeungfrom seven to thnteen,
inclusive Public surveyors were appointed by
the Legislature for each of these districts—men
of skill, probity, and mtegnty and among other
detailed duties, these sworn officers were required
to subdivide the whole "reservation" into sec-
tions of "five miles square " They weie par-
ticulaily instructed to note "the quality of the land,
and the mountains or other remaikable objects
touching or crossing the lines of the sections "
In the discharge of their official duties, these sur-
veyors necessauly acquainted themselves with
the quantity, quality, and relative value of the
lands within then respective districts I hope,
therefore, I shall not be chaiged with offending
against the strict law of evidence, by insisting
that then testimony is of the highest grade, and
signally entitled to the belief and confidence of
Senators
Mr President, I pass by the statements of the
surveyors of the seventh and eignth districts,
having already, in a prior part of my argument,
sufficiently adverted to their reports From the
next in number, the ninth district, we are told
that, " owing to the mode of appropnatmg lands,
the good soil yet remaining vacant consists oí
mere shuts and icraps, from the sale of which the
General Government can realise little or nothing
The purchase of these lands," the suiveyor adds,
" must be mostly by poor men, who have little
to give, in fact, their situation would not be much
betteied if they were to obtain them for nothing
the gift would be too well calculated to make
them always poor " On the evidence of the
surveyoi oí the tenth distnct, " all the valuable
lands have been appropriated by North Caiolin?
military land warrants suchas aie still vacant
lie in detached paicels, and are generally lery
pool " From the eleventh district, we learn that
" the greater portion of the vacant lands consists
of liver swamp, lying too low to be reclaimed
theie are, ' m the woids of the witness , " some
high lands, but they aie generally poor, and lie
in detached parcels, so much so, theie is no hes-
itation m saying that it would cost the United
States more money to bung them into market
than could be realized from the sale " Equally
stiongand conclusive are the declarations from
the twelfth district In the opinion of the officer
theie, " the amount of sales would not half pay
the expense of preparing the vacant lands for
market, as they he in detached parrels, and the
most valuable paits are in the smallest bodies "
In the last remaining subdivision, the suiveyor
contents himself on the general subjeetby stating
that the vacant lands within his district, " fit for
cultivation, are in small detached parcels "
I cannot dismiss this bianch of my argument,
without bunging before the Senate a witness of
more imposing character than either of those al-
ready pioduced, made so by the voluntary act of
the Govei nment, appealed to by the United States,
and, by all the lules of evidence, not to be dis-
credited or disiegaided by the party at whose in-
stance he is made to speak In April, 1829, the
Secretaiy of the Treasury, acting under ordei3
from the House of Representatives, caused a sub-
oidinate of his Depaitment, among other things
connected with the same subject, to institute an
inquiry into the estimated value of the unappro-
priated public lands lying m the " congressional
íeseivation " Under these instructions, the Com-
missioner of the General Land Office addressed
himself tc the then Secietaiy of State for the
State of Tennessee, and the information could
not have been sought for in higher oi more com-
petent quarters—tht individual thus selected, pos-
sessing in an eminent degree a clear and sciuti-
nizing mind, added to the weightof his credibility
the double advantage of a thoiough acquaintance
with the objects of your research In his able,
concise, but unanswciable report, in leply, he
concludes all he has to say, in the following ex-
pressive language
' P*o one it all acquainted with the true situation of the
country nil for a in nnent, doubt the impracticability of
I iyin;r oiT and selling whit remains (of these land ) upon
any svstem like the present, as practiced by the United
States, unikout positive loss to the G-oleminent "
Sir, after all this, I forbear to multiply proofs;
but, on the general worthless chaiacter of these
lands, I must say, and I say it respectfully, who-
ever doubts now would not be persuaded, "though
one rose fiom the dead "
But, Mr President, the preredent—good men,
otherwise fnendly to the measure, express great
fears lest the passage of this law should set an
example, not hereaftei to be disregarded by Con-
gress, in its general policy, tending toinvolve the
Government in a system of profligacy calculated
to destroy the national domain, and to rob the
old States of their just and equal participation in
our nch inheritance of public lands I honorand
respect such fears, but it does seem to me at the
same time, that a moment's reflection on the char-
acter and piovisions of this bill, with the proofs
that have followed it, should remove the misgiv-
ings and calm the apprehensions of the most
watchful and fastidious advocates of the lights
and intetests of the old States 1 deny both the
application of the argument and the supposed
analogy Tennessee does not able a donation of
these lands, a cession, without a fair consider
ation and a just equivalent, she does not approach
you in the attitude of a beggar, an humble sup-
pliant for favors, great oi small Sir, it was but
this morning, in a casual conversation with an
honorable Senator on my right, [Mr Williíms
of Mississippi 1 himself a native of my State, I
