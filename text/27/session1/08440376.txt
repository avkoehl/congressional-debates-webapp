APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August, 1841.
527th Cong.......1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Stuart.
II. of Reps.
««atees which give to this decision of the Government asanetity
which belongs to no othei adjudication Whit are these en
«umstancee? In the first place, itwasmade veryrecentty after
the Constitution wasfoimed, and at a period wn«n the views
andiaearingofitsfiamers weie necessauly much better un
derstood than they are now
Secondly, it was made, to a considerable extent, by the same
p«r ons who had framed the Constitution itself, and who, oi
course, are to be presumed to have understood ita provisions
bettei than any one else. And here, sir, let us resoit to the of
ficial records, and see precisely how this matter stands If
gentlemen will consult the journals, they ill find that there
were m the Senate of the United States, in the yeai 1791, eight
Members who had been members of the ct pvention which
formed the Constitution To avoid all misapprehension, 1 will
givethftir names, and if any getitleman deslíes to mal,c the
examination for himself,hecandosoby re'ernrgto the joui
Bal ot the Senate, 1791, page 234 The names aie John L tng-
don, New Hampshire, William S Johnson, Connecticut, Ru
fus King, New Yoik, Robert Moms, Pennsylvania, Richaid
Bassett, Delaware, George Retd, Delawaie Picut, Butler,
South Carolina, and William Few, Georgia Of these, the six
ftrst named voted m favor of the Bank, and the two last namtd
against it.
In the House of Representatives, ihei e were also eight mem
bars who had been membeis of the Federal Convention They
were George Clymer, of Pennsylvania, Tli >mas Fnzsimons,
Of Pennsylvania, Nicholas Gilman, of New Hampshne, lio
fer hherman of Connecticut; Abraham Baldwin of Georgia,
laniel Carroll, ot Maryland, Tames Madison, oí Vienna, and
Hugh Williamson, of Noith Caiohna 1 lie four fiist named
voted for the Bank, and the four last named jo ed again it it
It thus appeals tint, of the siseen mcnbeis ol iht lomen
Uon which formed the Constitution of the II ited ^ine who
were in the Congress of 1711, ten voied foi Hie Bank, and si\
«/¿aioet it.
Wealso know, officially, that Geoige \\ Islington, tin PieM-
dent of the Convention, and Alexander Hamilton, one oí jtn
most distinguished membeis, weie m lavoi ol tin Bank of the
united States; and we know, too, that James Mad's i,i, m 1815,
relinquished his objections to the constitutionally oí a Bmk
bo that, if we classify the members oí the Convention whose
opinions on thisimpoitant subject have been officially declared,
we will find they stand thn leen in favur ol it to five agamsut,
or nearly in the ratio of three to one' Heie I leave this pom',
with this single lnquny, which I throw out fm the consi lera
tion of those who aie to follow me in this deb le, Who cm be
more competent to give a ju^t exposition ol the Constitution
than those who framed Hi
The third cons delation, which seems to me lo g ve pecul ar
authority to the decision of the riist Congiess is, mat it was
made without icference to tho influences oí party The sub
ject was taken up and consldeied as a finan ial and business
measure, and it was discussed, as> all great measuies should be
discussed in oui legislative halls, with r ilmntss and digniiy md
"mutual forbeaiance, and it was decidtd as I hive already
• hown by a refeience to the journal, without an v leg in! to those
pirty i"fluencts which sometimes «way the judgment ol die
TOOst virtuous men
'fhelastuieumstance to which I will baiely advert, as giv-
Sngaperulm authouty to the decision oí 1711, is the chaiauer
Of the first President—the Fathei of his Counti v I d > not pro
$ose, Ml Chairman, to pronounce a studied eulogy on the
character of Washington Nothing tha' 1 could say could add
another ray to the halo of glory which suirounds his name
Nor will I stop to combat the views of thuso who c haige that
in His administration of the Government he dM titeu from the
true principles oí the Constitution Let others think whatlhey
may, 1 have no hesitation m announcing it as my opinion th it
George Washington was not only the purest andbest,but al«o
the wisest man that this couniry ever saw A benign Pi ivi
dence seems to have created Inm for the special purpos, of
achieving the independence of his" country, and of estábil lung
Its liberties upon sure and permanent foundations Ihisman,
then, fresh from the Convention which framed ihcConslitution,
over whose deliberations he had been chosen to pi side was
called on to decide tins great constitutional question Iiis
sound, dlsciiminuiog, and, I may almost a id, inflexible judg-
ment, was enlightened by the able aigumentsof llimdton on
the one side, and Randolph and Jefferson on the other, and, af
terthe most mature deliberation, lie gave his sanction to the
bill Ifalltheseconsnierationsdo not give authority and sine
tity to that judgment, what nrcumstai cea can give validity to
the decisions of a human ¡ribunali
Thus, sir, the Bank of 179.1 was established, md during
the whole period of its existence, its validnv was neve ques
uonod In our judicial tubunals And veiy sion the effects
which resulted from its cieation vindicated the wisdom ol its
projectors and supporters, for in the Unauige of the cele
brated report of Mr McUuiTie in 1830, "public and privóle
credit waa raised from a prostrate o avely elevated condition,
and the financesof the nation weio placed on 'he most solid
¿foundation '
Iwill now hasten on to -ther incidents connected with the
historyof the Bank Shouiy after Louisiana had been pui
chased by Mr Jeflerson, Congress dtemed it expe lienttoesti
blish a branch of the United States at New Oi leans, and with
thatview,a law was passed au honzmg the ilankto establish
branches "in any part of the Tern tones or dependencies of the
United States," I o this bill Mr Jelfuson, on the 211 of llar, h
]804, gave his sam tion —(See Laws of the United States, 1Q01,
chapter 32 )
Itis well known that Mr Jefferson wis one of the earliest
and most able opponents of the Bank and his gi eat name ,s al-
ways invoked <ib a uthorny by the enemies of die institution,
butlsubmit uto this House and to the countrv to decide whe
ther, when Mi Jeffei-nn signed this bill, he did not relinquish
his constitutional sciuples Haw is it pos^ib e that an oppo
nent of the constitutional powei to risaie i B-mk could lend
his aid to the extension of the powris and fiuiluts of site' an
institution? Where is the distinction betvvcen conlemngnn
constitutional powers upon an instit .tion a the time of up in-
ception, and externhnp- the sphere \v thin whit1) those rowirs
shall be exercised, or granting new lowers t, s ich in institu
tion already in existence? For myse f, I mu* c nfess mv ini
bility to perceive it, and I Isa-ye the po nt foi political casuists to
decide
But there is another lawto which I will mvde th  -Mention
of the House, as being calculated to throw some light upon the
opinions of Mr Jefferson In 1807 it was found (hat the exist
ing laws to punish frauds and forgenes on the Bank were de-
fective, and, toiemedy that evil, an additional act was passed
on the 24th of February. 1S07, and approved by Mi Jeffer
son, then Piesident of the United States, "to punish fsauds
committed on the Bank " This act will be found in Story s
edition of the Laws of the United States, volume 2, page
1048 A veiy superficial examination of this 'aw will show
that Mr Jefferson could not have sanctioned it without aban,
donmg his constitutional scruples In the first place, it lecog-
nises the Bank as having a corporate existence, for it provides
foi the pun shuient of frauds—against whom? The peon e?
No Thes>o kholders? No, but against the coiporation—the
Bank Now it lb peifeotly clear that if the law «eating the
B ink was uncons itutlonal, th  Bmk coul 1 have no coi poi a'e
existence, an I therefore no "fraud" could be committed upon
it In othei word , the law would have been nugatory and in
operative We aie bound, therefore, to suppose that Mr Jef
felbOn did lecognise the legal existence of i he Bank, and that
recognition necessai ily ¡mphes the powei of Congie-s to pass
the law which gave it existence
But theie is yetanother link in the chain of official documen
tuy evidence, to piovc that Mi Jefferson substantially al an
doned his constitutional objections to a Bank of the I'pi'ed
States On the 2d of Manh, 1809, Mr Albeit Gallatin, Mi Jef
felon's Seri'btiry of iheTreasuiy, and the man who has been
significantly called the "mainmast of h s Administiation "
whilst the relation of Piesident and Secietary still subsisted be-
tween them, submitted an able repou to Coogiess, lecommend-
lng the lecha ter of the Btnk of the Unned States I do not
rretond to affirm ,hat thislecommendation was made with the
absent of Jefferson, but I leave it for the countiy to decide whe-
ther it i  piobable consideimg the confidential le'ations winch
existed between Mi Gallatin md the President, that he would
n-ive concealed the fact Horn Mi J-fieison that he intended to
submit bueh a report! I isk w hether it is to be pivsumed that
any Secittaiy would have lenturtdto pnpobe a measure of
sin i vital i',tere-t without the sauct'on oí the President' I
Hunk not, and if Mr Bill itm weie [o feel liurieelf at liberty to
«pe k, I leel well assuietl that he would sov that Mr Jefferson
wa, fully appnsed of his intention to submit the lenoit of>d
Maioh, 1809, and thai it met his-ipprobation.
S) much, Mr Chairman, foi the hlstoiy oí the Bank of 1791
I will now pioceed to íeviewsome ol the leadin  incidents ron
nccled with theaboitiveeffurtb to procue a rocharter of that
Bu k, and with the struggles which resulted m the chaitei of
fne chaitei of the Bmk was limited to lsn Inisiosn
attempt was male to leiew it, which was not finadv acled
on
On the llh nl I nuiry, 1811, a hill to renew the chattel wis
lepoited to the House oí Rt presen to uves by Mr Burwell
After this bill b nl tin leigone a d -< us-ion ex endm°- thrnn«h
seventeen ilivs, Mi Newtnu, of Virginia on lie 21bt of Jan
1811, moved to postpone the bill indefinitely (See Journal
I'll, page 495) Mr Newton premised this motion by savin '
"I am for laving tl e legislative axe at the loot of the evil °I
am for immtih ttelvdeci ling thlsquesiion, and turum^to s >me
othei businc and loi tin  purpose, 1 move that the fuitl ei
conbideiauon ol tin bill be in lefinitely postponed " (See Doc
Hist U a Bui, psgo 186) This piop sition elicited an-
othei very able discussion, and, on the 2tth of Jmuary 1811
the vote was taken by ayes and noes—(see Jiurnal, 181Í page!
S00)—and the result was ayes 6"5, nois 04 So the motion was
rained There is one fact in legaid to this vote to which I
will call the attention of the House, and which I beg léate to
commend to the particu ar con-mltt ^ílor of my colleague Í" nm
the Buckingham disti id Mi Hi earo ) It is, that John Ran
dolph of Rnnoke, the gentleman -. illusinous piedecessor
voted against Mi JNewton's motion to "lay the ave to the'
root " by dOotioymg the Hmk
The subject ol a lenewal ol the chaitei was intioduced into
thebenate, also at Ihe same session, and, after full discussion
the pi oposition to sti ike out the enacting clause was can led by
Ihe casting vote of the Vice Piesident ol the United States the
Senate being equally divided—17 to 1", and this division i'will
add, was without regaid to party, for we find Mr Brent of
Viienna, and Wm H Crawford, in the negative, whilstGlleg
and Clav, and other distinguished Republicans, were in the
affirmative
Thus it will be seen that this measure was lost by a maionty
of one m the House of Repiesentatlves, and by tile casting
vote of tl e Vice President m ihe Senate i And yet this is the
decision upon which the gentleman from Noith Carolina [Mr
Sai\dfksJ iel.es, as oveuulmgthe decision of thelaigema
joiHiesinine < ongressol 1791, and the sohmn judgment of
Presid nt Washmglo i ' Toi my part. Ml Chairman I regaid
this decision as having none of the authority of a constitutional
pirredent, foi, independently of the leanness of the majorities
there aie other encumstances which show that tho question'
wasdeciled not upon Constitutional grounds, but upon mere
considerations ofexpehency This is manifest from the fact
that we see gent emeu of opposite political opinions voting to
eethei, a-, for example William H Crawford of Georgia and
Timothy Pickering, ofMassachusetts
Buttheie aieother views which show why the Blnk was
not rechaitoied ^cven tenths of the whole siock of the institu
tion was owned by Bntish subjects, and as we were in 1811 on
the eve ofa war witn Great Biitam eveiy consideration of
sound policy would seem to require that such a Bank should
not be rechaitered under such circumstance .
Here, Mr Speaker, let me pause for a moment to adven to

Bin the year 1811 the subject ol incorporating a Bank of he
United States was again renewed    On the 2d of April, 1814
Mi  Grundy of Tennessee moved the following íesolution        '
"Resolnpd, That a committee be appointed to inquire into
the expediency of establ ehing a National Bank "—(See Journal
1814 p 330
This wasneai the close of the session, however, and no ac-
tion grew out of it
On the 19th of Septembei, 1814, a special session of Congres s
commenced, and on the 14th of Octobei John W Eppes, the
chanman of the Committee of Ways and Means, addteseed a
lettei to Alexander Dallas, the Secietaiy I the Treasury, ask
mg him to suggest measures for the levival and maintenance of
ihe public credit And heie, Mr. Chairman, permit me Ito
pause for a moment to note, the coincidence between the course
taken by Congiess in 1814 and in 1790 In both cases the Se-
cretary of the Tieasury was c lied on to suggest measures to
es'abbsh the public cieiiit The language is"aImost the same
in both rases In 1790 Hamilton is t ailed upon to leport mea
suies foi "establishing the public ci edit," and in 1511 Dallas is
requested to suggest "such additional provisions as may be ne-
cessary to revive and mam'ain linimpaued the public credit "
It wouldseem, from the similanty of the means used, that the
Congress of 1814 was aiuving indnectly at the same end
wh eh was a'tained by the inquiry of 1790 viz the recummen
dation ofa Btnk of the United States Whether such was the
intention or not it Is very certain that such was ¡he result fer
on the 17th of the same month Mi Dallas lesponded to trie in-
quiry by recommending the esta1 lishmentof. National Bank!
After full coi sideration oí tins communication of Mr Dallas'
the committee leported a resolution, in these woids                  '
Rc-sohed, That it is exf eJiei t to esiabhsh a Nauona] Bank
with branches ti the several States"—(So, Journal 1S141
p 504)                                                                                           '
Upon this resolution some proceedings were had, which I
commend to the atte tion of those gentlemen w ho are opposed
to the blanching power of the Bank of the United States Mr
Stanford moved to strike out the latter b'anch of the resolu-
tion, "with blanches in the several States " Upon this question
tl e yeas and nays weie taken, and the vote stood yeas 14 nays
138 And among the nays were P P Baibour ot Virginia J
C Calhoun of South Carolina, J W Eppes o^Vii^ima' J*
Forsyth of Geoign, C J Ingeisod of Pennsylvania, j'G
Jackson of Virginia, Wm R. King, now of Alabama W
Lowndes of South Carolina and Alfred Cuthbert of Geo'r«la
and a host nf i thei distinguished Republicans—(isee Journal
1814, pp 504-5 )
The amendment having been defeated, the question recurred
on the adoption of the oi igmal resolution And here I take leave
to say tint this is the only occasion within m> knowledee on
which the absti act question of Bank or no Bank has been"sub-
mitted 'o Congress, unembairassed by any matter of detail in
the particu'ar measuie proposed Itpiesens the naked ques-
tion, to he decided without referem e to any extraneous circum-
stances and hence the decision possesses more interest and
more authouty as a precedent than any othei decision within
my knowledge Now, sir, how do you suppose the vole stood
If vouwdl consult Ihe Journal of 1811, pages 505 and W you
will find (hit, upon this abstract pi o|,osi lo „ the vote stood' ayes

Senatoi from Alabama, Mr Lowndes of South Caiohna-
and many other distinguished Republican , as well as those
of Mi Gaston, Mr Webster, and other disimguished Fede-
ralists
Without going further into details, it is sufficient to say that
abill was intioduced and passed in the Sena'e by a vote of 17
to 14 and which was rejected in the House by the casting
vote of the Speakei. (See Journal 1815, pages 6"S-9 ) A few
days altei wards this vote was reconsidered by a vote of 107 to
5Í—mosi of the Republicans voting for it (See Journal 1816
pages bll-¿) The bill was then recommitted to a selec com-
mittee, who shortly afterwards leported it with amendments
reducing the capital from fifty tothnty millions nf dollars and
it was passed by a vote of 129 to 31—mo.t of tho lee'dm 
Republicans again voting for it     [See Journal 1815, pages
This bill was sent to Mr Madison for his rignaluie, and on
the 30th of Januaiy, 1815, he retuined it with his objections or
in other woids, he vetoed the hill But, sir did he i est his ob-
jections on constitutional grounds? Let his message answer
for him In that memorable doci ment Mr Madison used these
stiong expressions
"Waivirg the question of the constitutional authority of the
Legislatuie to establish an incorporated bank as being preclu-
ded, in my judgment, by repeated recognitions under varied
encumstances of the validity of such an institution, in acts of
the Legislative Executive the Judicial branches of the Govern-
ment, accompanied by indications In different modes of the,
concurrent will of the nation, the proposed bank does not ar-
pear to b> calculated to answei ihe puiposesof revivin  Ihe
public credi, of piovlding a national medium of circulalion
and of a ding the Treaseiy by facilitating the indispensable an'
ticipations of the revenue, and by affoidmg to the public more
dutable loans "
Here, Mr Chairman, it will be seen that Mr Madison dis
tmctly aban Ions his constitutional objections, and, treatirg
that question as settled, he rests his veto on the defects m the
provisions of the bill itself
