undertake. Section 2d of the bill declares* sx-
pre^siy thu ''all fuiflrey payments, securities
conveyances, or transfers of property, or ass'gn-
ments made or given by any bankrupt in eoi-
templaiion ot bankruptcy, and for the purpose
of giving any creditor, endorser, surety, or other
person any preference or priority over the general
creditors of such bankrupt, and all other payments,
securities, or transfers of property, or agreements
made or given by such bankrupt in contemplation
of bankruptcy to any person or persons whatso-
ever, not being a bona fide creditor or purcha-
ser for a valuable consideration, without noticed
shall be deemed utterly void, and a fraud upon _
this act; and the assignee under the bankruptcy'
shall be entitled to claim, sue for, recover,
and receive the same as a part of the assets
of the bankruptcy; and the person making such
unlawful preferences m payments, shall re-
ceive no ¿Vcharge under the provision of this
act." Ard if he be a merchant, banker, factor,
broker, underwriter, or marine insurer, owing debts
to the amount of $2 000, and ^hall depait the State
with intent to defraud his creditors; or shall conceal
himself to avoid arrest, or shall conceal or remove
his property to prevent its being taken in fxecu-
lion; or shall willingly or fraudulently procure
himself to be arrested or bis property to be levied
upon; or shall make any fraudulent transfer of his
real estate, he is immediately liable to be divested
of his whole property on the petition of one of hw
creditors, to have it distributed among «hem, while
he himself is still liab'e for the whole amount of
his debt*. Does all this show no legard for cre-
ditors. It would, indeed, be difficult to protect
their interest* more effectually, unless the debtors
should be made their absolute slaves—their pro-
perty.
In many of the arguments to which I have lis-
tened, there has been an apparent confounding of
the decree of bankruptcy with the final discharge.
There is no necessary connection; a discharge does
not, of course, follow the decree, and from what I
have already said the importance of keeping in
view the distinction is manifes*. The decree of
bankruptcy is- made before the discharge can be
granted, and before the parties have ken heard on
the latter subject. Three months at least must
intervene, and seventy da>s' notice be given of ihe
time and p'aoe for hearing the application for a
discharge, and even then it cannot be granted bv
thecouit, ll a majority in number and value of the
creditors who hate proved their debt's dfsent, un
less the app icani shall demand a trial by jury, and
obtain a verdict in his favor, or shad, by a,>peil
to ihe Circuit Conn, entile himself to a discharge,
as provided in the founh section. And, m all
these proceedu g«, he is hable to encounter ihe ob-
jections not only of all those who have b-co-ne par-
ties to 'he record, but < f ' all persons in interest,"
however grest or however small ihit interest may
be; and ev-n the discharee its-lf, less potent than
the discharge under the English bankrupt s\stem,
which can be impeached lor no species of fraud,
except, perhap*, the adm'S<ion of a fic'itious debt
by the btnkrupt, may be impeached and defeated
for any description of fiaud, or even a "¡ulful con-
cealment of propeny," contrary to the provisions
of the art. Would seniiernen require more vigo-
rous provisions in behalf >' ere ¡<ot<l ! rm' ss

the objection ra'.«d bv ihe í-oní rabie .mnib-r hat ¡
the r'gh «. of credi o-s ai< not .uffic onily secuied, is |
far from being ta ¡am d by ihe actual p ovis ons
ot the bill
But  in   this, as in most oth r at emp's to leei
late  in   this  Had,  vie are ret by the   frrmidib'e
objection  that  the m"asme viola es the   Corsitu
Hon      Notwithstanding  that instrument give  to
Congress, in «press terms, the power "to establish
uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies
throughout the United States," it is contended that
the bill under consideraron, inasmuch as it pur-
ports to discha'ge the debtor from his liability,
"impairs the obligation of coniracts,"and is iheie-
fore unconstitutional. It seems to be absolutely
impossible that any measure, no maiter what
may be its character or object, should be started
in the Congress of the United States which does
not encounter the standing, ste'eotyped objection
that it is unconstitutional. The decisions of the
courts go for no hing; the his'ory of the Govern-
ment and country goes for nothin ; and each gen-
tleman sinves to be foremost in laising the clamor
that the mensuréis ucconstt utional Such is the
strictness wuh which they affect to guard that in-
strument that, I will venture to snrm'«e, if it were
proposed to assert, m the form of an ?ct or a reso-
lution, th  principles of the Decalogue, the objec-
tion would be mstanilv and vehemently urged dial
"It is unconstitutional'"
The gentleman from Kentucky [Mr. Plps.] ob-
jects to the bill on this supposed constitutional
ground of violation of contract; and asserts, with
confidence, that even in England the bankrupt'^
d scharge is not without the consent of his creditors,
but "is a mere agreerrent between the parties"—
a mere release on their part of their claim  against
him. A more careful examination of the British
statutes upon this subject will, I am satisfied, con-
vince him that the discharge does not rest upon an
agreement of the parties, hut that ns efficacy re-
sults from the power of Parliament ove  th^ rela-
tion of deb'or and creditor. I'is rep arded 5,s a
mode of remedy fully within the competency of
the law-making cosher, and not as a viola'ion of
cintraos. In England, it lb t'ue,that, prelimi-
nary to the discharge, the proceedings rcqui e that
at least four partsmfive, in number and value, ol
the creditors (excepting, however, every creditor
whose claim does not amount to twenty pounds)
should sign a certificate to ihe effect that the bank-
rupt has conformed to the direclions of the law.
But tbe discharge indemnifies and releases him
from "all debts due by him at the time of bis
bankruptcy." If, therefore, the discharge be but
a meie agreement, it is clear that it wtuldnot
bar the c aim of a creditor who had not signed the
certtficue required by ihe pro&edmg ; toi ih->
granting of a r< It sc by my neighbor of a debt
against an mdivi'iial taimot afiect my c'som
apainst the same ind v  «al
But why resort lo Engli h statutes and prece-
dent, in givins; a constriction to the O i" stuutior?
Why refer to them in or ei ¡o ascertain tie mean-
ing of the voul "bankruptcy," when in^ m in-
ference to the power pc c-s'd by the Statesovtr

bws But n would be very difficult to sustain this distinction
by any uniformity ol laws, at home or aoioad   In some of the
States, laws, known as insolvent laws, discharge the person
only, in others they discharge the contract And if Congress
were to pass a bankrupt aci winch should discharge the per-
son only ol ti e bankrupt, and leave his future acquisitions lia
ble to his creditors,, there would be great difficulty m ^aying
thatsuch an act wasnot, in the sense of the Constitution, a
bankrupt aet,andso within thepotverof Congress Airain it
has been said that insolvent laws act on imprisoned debtors
only at their own instance, and bankrupt laws only at the in-
stance of cieditors But, however tiue this may have been in
times past, as the actual course of English legislation, it is not
true, and never was true, as adisttnction m colonial legislation
In England it was an accident m the system, and not a material
ground to discriminate who v, ere o be deemed in a legal sense
insolvents or bankrupts And if an act of Congress should be
passed, which should authorize a commission ol bankiuptcy
l sue at the instance of the debtor, no couit would, on mis
account, be wairanted m saying that the act was unconstitu
tinnal and the commission a nullity It is believed ihat no laws
weie ever passed in Ametica by the colonies or States which
had the technical denomination of bankiupt ldws' But in-
solvent laws, quite Co extensive with the Fngh-.h bankrupt
system in their operation and objects, have not been untre-
queni m colonial and fe ale legislation No distinction was
evei piactically, or even theoietically, aucmpedto bt. imde
made between bankruptcies and insolvencies And an histo
rical leview of the colonial and State legislation will abun
dantly show that a bankiupt law may contain those regula
tlons which aie gereially found m insolvent law, and that
an insolvent law may contatn those which are common to ban4c
rupt taws "
Now, sir, it seems to me, that to all the objec-
tions which have been urged agamst this bill on the
ground of the supposed distinction between bank-
rupt laws and insolvent laws, between the volun-
tary and involuntary principle, are fully answered
by the extiact I have read. And the opinions are
not merely those of the distinguished author; they
are based on the decisions of the Supreme Court of
the Uni ed Siates, in which they were long ago am-
d seussed They constitute the law, as applicable
to ihe subj'c', and we are bound to respect them as
f uch. The < bjeciioo at least comes t< o late, and I
am not ore of il oie who set up to be "wise above
that which is wn'ten." Toe policy of taking tie
po'ver from the States and giving it to Corgress, is
raamiesi; it was to give the ciuzen the same pro-
tection in one part of the Union as in another, and
place him m this respeet beyond tbe local and con-
flicting legislation of ihe States. But this view has
been so ably presented by the gentleman from
Pennsylvania, [Mr Sergeant] who preceded me,
that I will nolongT dwell upon it.
Mr Chanmsn, I trust .this bill will pass this
House and beceme a law. We are called upon,
by mofiites of humanity, 'o relieve our unror(unaie
and suffer'"g fellow-eiiiZ3n ,who are now petiiKn-
irg tis—im; lor.og i's with uplifted hinds—lo rev-
cue them from a condition which, by no dishonest
act of theirs, is crushing them to the earth; which
dampens their enterprise and humbles the r spuits;
which makes them a burden to their fnend<, and
life i^elf ii tie better than a burden to themselves.
Sir, 'hey are our lellow-creatures, and entitled to
ot:r chanpes they are oui countrymen, and en ltled
to the protection cf their Conslnu ion; they have
families, for v. horn nature, more powetful than hu-
man laws, compels lhern to provide. Let Us not
wit! hold our sympathies from them Let us not
turn a dea' ear to th-ir prayers. LFt us relieve
ibem by a lust exerc^e of ihe powers entrusted to
us; and we send a ihnll of j jy through ihe h-itris
of thousands.
