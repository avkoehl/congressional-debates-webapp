KENESAW, June 27, 1864.

Major-General FRENCH,

Commanding:

I have just sent a staff officer, Major Williams (of Mercer's staff), to General Cockrell. To advance my skirmishers now, who are 250 yards in front of my line, yours being in your intrenchments (if I am correctly informed), exposes them to an open fire in a field, which after they have crossed they meet a line of battle which they gallantly fought with to-day, being clubbed and bayoneted in the pits, owing, they say, to the enemy having passed their right flank, where your skirmishers were supposed to be.

Respectfully,

W. H. T. WALKER,

Major-General.

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy have prepared during the night dirk works for the protection of their artillery on the hill in front of my left. Whether the works are more extensive than this I cannot discover. Some demonstrations are being made to my right on Colonel Miller's regiment. I think it necessary to strengthen that part of the line to prevent their getting in rear of my position here.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The enemy are fortifying and building works rapidly on the right of my line. Their right (or right of their works) rests near Cheney's house. The force in my front, so far as I can see, have only thrown up works for the protection of their artillery.

Please inform me if you have strengthened the line on my right. There is an interval between my right and Humes' left of one mile, occupied by Colonel Miller's regiment, and it cannot hold the ground.

I am, general, very respectfully, &c.,

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.

GENERAL: Miller's regiment on my right has given up its position and fallen back, leaving my flank exposed. If you wish me to hold this position here much longer, please strengthen Miller and re-establish his
