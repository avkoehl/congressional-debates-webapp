DALTON, May 7, 1864.

General WHEELER,

Commanding Cavalry:

Report from the officer commanding at Dug Gap on the Villanow road, says Dortch's battalion has come to the top of the mountain and encamped with the infantry post. General Johnston says that it is absolutely necessary that a good regiment of cavalry under an officer on whom you can fully rely, be sent into the valley south and west of Mill Creek Gap. Please give positive orders on this subject; it will not do to leave that valley open to-night.

Respectfully,

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.

MILL CREEK GAP,

(Received at Dalton, Ga., May 7, 1864-2.40 p. m.)

General MACKALL:

A wagon train has been reported moving to our left. So far as we could tell from the top of the mountain, the train was not very large. Our cavalry should watch our left closely and in force sufficient to cause the enemy to develop and move slowly. He should not be allowed to make a night march for fear of being ambushed. Cavalry can do this.

J. B. HOOD,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS HOOD'S CORPS,Dalton, May 7, 1864.

Major-General HINDMAN,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: In reply to your note of to-night, General Hood directs me to inform you that you may retire the right of your picket-line as you suggest. He has written to General Johnston asking to have the Fiftieth Alabama report back to you, and will try and get the two Mississippi regiments for you that you speak of.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. W. RATCHFORD,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

DALTON, May 7, 1864.

Colonel J. A. Williamson, Second Arkansas Rifles, will proceed to Villanow Gap and take post there. He will relieve the picket now there and order it to report to its brigade. The colonel will observe the enemy, and defend the gap against any attempt of the enemy. He will report to General Johnston any movements of the enemy that he observes.

W. W. MACKALL,

Chief of Staff.
