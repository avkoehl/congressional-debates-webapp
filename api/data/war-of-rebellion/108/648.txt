Brigadier General R. RANSOM, Jr.,

Commanding Division:

GENERAL: The lieutenant-general commanding directs that instead of marching from Orange Court-House to Hanover Junction, as directed in my notes of last night and this morning, you take the most direct route from Orange to Guiney's Station, on the Richmond and Fredericksburg Railroad, distant about fourteen miles from Fredericksburg. On the march you will put yourself in communication with Major-General McLaws, who, in addition to the orders of which you were this morning advised, has been directed to pursue his march from Chancellorsville to Fredericsburg. The general commanding desires that you observe such instructions and orders as Major-General McLaws may send you.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. M. SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General Lee leaves to day for the same point, and at daylight to morrow morning I leave to join General Longstreet.

Very respectfully,
