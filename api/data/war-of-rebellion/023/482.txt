at this moment. Let us first get ready a force adequate to meet the enemy and then attack and drive him from the country. Yield to impatience and move with inferior forces against our disciplined foe and we are again defeated. See what force we have about Louisville or Cincinnati and say if we should instantly move forward. We had better give the rebels temporary possession than to risk all while that chances are against us. Your suggestions would be undoubtedly sound if our forces were larger.
