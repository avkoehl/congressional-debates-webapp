General Hurlbut. It is important that all troops that can possibly be spared should be sent to the Tennessee River to assist General Rosecrans.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

It will hardly be possible for me to send any troops to General Rosecrans. I am compelled to call out Missouri militia to relieve troops sent to Steele until General Pope's troops arrive. The radical papers are opposing it, and doing all in their power to create disaffection in the militia.

SECRETARY OF WAR:

A reliable person, who left Atlanta, Ga., on the 4th instant, states that he passed on his way from Atlanta to Richmond three divisions of Lee's army on its way to re-enforce Bragg at or near Dalton, Ga., and that the general report was that the rebel forces were to be concentrated at or near there, for the purpose of overthrowing Rosecrans' army.
