his products remaining the same, the result of
this decrease of cost of the articles he uses is
practically the same as increased protection to
him.
The reduction of the duty on spieeshasbeen
made in the interest of revenue, for the pur-
pose of increasing their consumption, and also
to prevent smuggling, now made profitable by
excessive duties.
COTTON.
Let us now consider the provisions of the
bill in relation to manufactures of cotton.
The classification has been simplified by bring-
ing into one class what is now divided into
many classes. But upon the articles most
imported the duty has not been raised, while
there is a reduction upon a number of articles
which we do not largely import. For instance,
the largest importation in quantity and value
of any one kind of cotton manufactures during
the last year was plain bleached cotton goods,
valued at 20 cents or less per square yard, the
duty upon which is now 5 J cents per square
yard. Of these goods there were imported
last year 17,619,748J square yards, at an aggre-
gate valuation of $2,345,738 48, and a duty
collected of $927,086 17. The pending bill
imposes upon this class of goods a duty of 5
cents per square yard, and 10 per cent, ad
valorem, which upon the importation of a like
number of square yards would amount to
$1,115,156 24.
In 1867 there were imported of this same class
of goods 17,793,305 yards, at an aggregate val-
uation of $3,574,263 15; and a duty collected
of $978,031 81, the average rate of duty for
1867 being 27J- per cent. The duty imposed in
the bill upon a like number of square yards
would be $1,267,091 25. It is true that upon
the same class of goods, printed, painted,
or colored, there ia a reduction of jj a cent
per yaid, which reduction, however, is not
equivalent to the increase upon the cheaper
goods. There is also a small reduction upon
jeans, denims, &c., the specific rate being re-
duced from GJ cents to 5 cents per yard, and
the ad valorem tax increased from 15 per cent,
to 20 per cent. But the importations of the
last-named class of articles amount to less
than one half the importations of the articles
upon which the duty is increased; and, I should
add, the ad valorem rate upon the last-named
articles exceeds 50 per cent. There is also a
small reduction upon cotton thread of 5 per
cent, ad valorem; but the existing rate of duty
upon this class of thread is 70 per cent, ad va-
lorem, showing that a larger reduction of duty
should be made upon this class.
Turn again to cotton shirts and drawers, on
which the duty is now 35 per cent., and of
which there is a considerable importation, and
you will find that we have added to these 5
cents per pound by the proposed bill. Upon
articles, therefore, of actual necessary wear—
cheap articles that are used by the great body
of our people—we increase the duty by the
proposed measure by 8 per cent, on one arti-
cle and 5 cents per pound on another. I only
mention the leading items.
WOOL AND WOOLEN GOODS.
Let me call attention, in the next place, to
wool and woolen goods. And I will say with
regard to the duty on wool aud woolens that
I regard it not as an intentional fraud, but as
opeiating as though it were a fraud upon the
great body of the people of the United States.
1 allude to the woolen tariff, so called, of 1867,
a lav/ by which the average duty on woolen
goods is certainly not less than 60 per cent, of
the value we import; a law the effect of which
lias been to materially injure the sheep hus-
bandry of this country. In a single county in
the State of Iowa represented here by my col-
league, [Mr. Loughridge]—-the county of
Poweshiek—between the two years of 1867 and
1869 the .number of sheep was reduced more
than 5,000—from 22,000 and upward to about
18,000—in a period of two years. Aud what
is true of this county is true, to a greater or
less extent, of other counties in Iowa; and
during this time the price of wool has con-
stantly been depreciating. Now, what I object
to in this bill is, that this injustice in regard to
the duty on woolens has been repeated. The
authors of this bill reindorse the tariff of 1867.
Now, I want to call the attention of the com-
mittee to the excuse made for the tariff of
1867. That tariff was made by certain gen-
tlemen representing the wool-manufacturers of
this country, and certain other gentlemen rep-
resenting the wool-growers, and was regarded
as an equitable adjustment of the differences
between the wool-growers and the wool-man-
ufacturers. And I have before me a report
made by this joint committee, which report was
embodied in the act of 1867. This report was
prepared early in 1866, at a time when all the
internal revenue laws which I have before
spoken of were in operation, and which had
been already compensated for by the tariff of
1864. This committee of wool-growers and
wool-manufacturers prepared and submitted
to Congress a table exhibiting the extent of
these taxes upon the manufacture of woolen
goods, showing the increased cost of such
goods on account of the tax to be, on a yard
of cassimere of average weight and quality,
lO^y cents; upon a suit of clothes of the same,
76 cents; upon a coat made of average broad-
cloth, 73 cents, &c.; and that, too, although
at that time no internal revenue tax was levied
upon wool. The internal revenue law of 1867
embodied in it an increased rate of duty to
compensate for this specific tax. Now, although
these taxes have been removed, the bill pro-
poses to reSnact the tariff of 1867, thus giv-
ing woolen-manufacturers a greater advan-
tage over the wool-growers than they had under
the act of 1864. If they desire to carry out
what was then regarded as an equitable arrange-
ment the duty upon woolens should be reduced
to the extent of the abolition of tho internal
tax at least, and a reduction of one fifth, as I
propose, would not amount to so great a re-
duction as to correspond with the abolition of
internal taxes. Such a reduction would benefit
the eonsumer and not injure either the wool-
grower or woolen-manufacturer.
Mr. LAWRENCE. I should like the gentle-
man to inform me how a reduction of the duties
on wool and woolen goods would inure to the
advantage of the wool-grower?
Mr. ALLISON. I will tell the gentleman
how, in my own judgment, the wool-grower
will be benefited. As the law now is, the tariff
upon fine wools of a character not produced in
this country is 100 per cent, upon their cost.
The tariff upon woolens of the same class is
only about 50per cent.; so that the finer woolen
goods are imported, and not the coarser fabrics.
Before the tariff of 1867 our manufacturers of
fine goods mixed foreign fine wools with our own
domestic product, and thus were able to com-
pete successfully with the foreign manufacturer
of similar articles. But being prohibited from
Importing this class of wools, these fine goods
cannot now be produced in this country so
cheaply as they can be imported. Consequently
mills that were formerly engaged in producing
those goods have been compelled to abandon
business or manufacture the coarser fabrics. Il
they could afford to manufacture those fine
goods they would make a market, which we do
not now have, for our fine wools to be mixed
with other fine wools of a different character
from abroad. This want of a market, as I
understand, is the reason "why our fine wools
now command so low a price; there is no
demand for them at home and we cannot ex-
port them in competition with fine wools grown
in other countries.
I call the attention of gentlemen to the sta-
tistics of importations. They will find that
almost the entire importation of woolens is
confined to the finer fabrics, such as dress-goods
for ladies and fine cloths for gentlemen. These
goods are imported because the importation
duty is less than it is upon coarser fabrics.
Yet the average duty upon these goods is over
60 per cent., while upon articles more com-
monly worn by the great body of our people
the rate of duty is such as practically to pro-
hibit their importation. Take, for example,
the article of blankets. Probably 8,000,000
blankets, or one for each family, are used each
year in the United States. Yet the total import-
ation of blankets during the last, year amounted
to less than $4,000, the rate of duty being 50
cents per pound, and 35 per cent, ad valorem,
or prohibitory in its character, so that we
derive little or no revenue from coarser woolen
goods, and t,be domestic manufacturer is with-
out foreign competition. It cannot be claimed
that this high duty should be maintained in the
face of the fact that we have abolished all inter-
nal taxes upon manufactures, the existence of
which was made the excuse for these prohib-
itory duties. The same illustration will apply
to other coarse goods.
Mr. DICKEY. Will the gentleman yield
for a question on that wool business?
Mr. ALLISON. Certainly.
Mr. DICKEY. Do we not get blankets
cheaper now than we did before the duty was
imposed?
Mr. ALLISON. No, sir; in 1860 a blanket
was worth $3 50, and now a blanket of the
same character costs, I believe, about $6; cer-
tainly much more than before this tariff.
Mr. DICKEY. In 1860?
Mr. ALLISON. Yes, I am speaking of 1860.
The following table shows more fully the cost
abroad of certain specified articles, and the
total duty on the same, as provided by the
tariff of 1867 on wool and woolens, which table
I take from the statements made by the woolen
manufacturers to Congress in 1866:

wools and carpets, whereby, under this tariff,
carpetwools are imported at a very low rate of
duty, while carpets pay a very high rate of duty.

I now call the attention of the committee to
the provisions of the pending measure in rela-
