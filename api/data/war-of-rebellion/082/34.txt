ing the allowance of transportation for small-arm ammunition the lieutenant-general designed also to reduce in proportion the amount of ammunition to be carried. Heretofore when three wagons have been allowed for such ammunition sixty rounds per man only have been carried in the wagons.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, July 6, 1864

Major-General MEADE:

The number of rounds of small-arm ammunition will be reduced in proportion to the reduction of transportation.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

A deserter, just in, reports that day before yesterday an officer of his regiment said he saw on the bulletin board at Richmond a dispatch reporting the defeat of Sherman at Atlanta and his retreat. The same deserter says he left a Richmond paper of to-day at the picket-line, which announced, the capture of Harper's Ferry by Early. I have sent for the paper, and will forward it when I get it.

CITY POINT, July 6, 1864.

General MEADE:

I have received a dispatch from Harper's Ferry direct, dated 12 m. to-day, and no special alarm is felt for the safety of that place. The enemy are crossing, however, at Antietam Ford. This part of the deserter's story is, therefore, premature, and I have no doubt but the other is. I expect it will be ascertained that Johnston retreated to his works, at Atlanta, and Sherman has failed in an attack on that place.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I am glad to hear the satisfactory news from Harper's Ferry. I attached no importance to the deserter's story in either particular; but as he made the statement, I thought you ought to be apprised of it.

GEO. G. MEADE.

Major-General.
