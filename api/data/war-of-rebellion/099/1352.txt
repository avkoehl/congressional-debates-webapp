mounted men and four pieces of artillery were reported last night to have gone down the Lowry road toward Fayetteville. I understand (only from negroes) on the Lowry road, this information. He said they passed W. J. Brown's house about sunset and were dressed in blue clothes. He did not know positively whether they were ethe enemy or our men, but whoever they were, they burned the bridge on the Lowry road across Raft Swamp. I sent Lieutenant Roberts and two men to ascertain the truth of this statement, but he could get no farther than the Raft Swamp bridge, and could not find a man or woman on the road except this negro. All the people are terribly alarmed and have taken to the swamps.

Respectfully, &amp;c.,

HDQRS. DETACHMENT FIFTH TENNESSEE CAVALRY,McEachin's Bridge, March 8, 165.

Major TAYLOR:

MAJOR: The enemy, after burning everything at Laurinburg, yesterday evening withdrew again to Srpingfield, where they encamped in considerable force. They told the citizens they would visit them again this morning. From the beating of the drums about Springfield I judge their infantry are encamped at that place. If they move this way from Laurinbrug or Laurel Hill I will notify you at once.

Respectfully, your most obedient servant,
