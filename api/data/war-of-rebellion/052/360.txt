SEPTEMBER 5, 1863.

General OSTERHAUS,

Big Black:

Get evidence, if possible, that Sulzer was a party to the murder of that negro. In the mean time hold him in close arrest. Send all prisoners of war to the provost-marshal, with a list, duplicate, to the inspector-general here. I will soon swap all these fellows away, but in the mean time let your men practice scouting.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

General BUCKLAND:

I have just read your report of this morning. When the mounted patrol of General Corse leaves Post Oak to join their regiments, they will leave their horses, saddles, &amp;c. I will increase the equipments, so you can have at all times 50 men for patrols. I doubt the propriety of letting any one pass into or out of Vicksburg, but we wish to keep up an understanding with the people outside. Keep things as you find them till I give specific orders. To affect the country outside your lines I would move out from here northeast. Trust the negroes when you think them worthy, and impress upon them that, to deserve freedom, they must respect the rights of humanity. Send all who are arrested to the provost-marshal at Vicksburg with at letter. Encourage the citizens. I will answer their petition at length.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

SEPTEMBER 5, 1863.

General BRUCKLAND:

Oak Ridge:

If the rebel cavalry make any demonstration on your flank, I do not propose to follow them in that direction, but to strike due east and destroy Clinton. I have my cavalry back now, and only want them rested. I propose to ride into Vicksburg to-morrow; should anything occur, telegraph me there and here both.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Big Black River, Miss., September 5, 1863.

Captain YOUNG:

General Osterhaus has directed me to inform you that you must leave our lines within four hours. An ambulance will be sent for you at the expiration of that time, when you and your baggage will be passed across the line.

W. A. GORDON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
