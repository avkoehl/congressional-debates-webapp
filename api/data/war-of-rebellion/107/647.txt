HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1862-9.20 p. m.

General R. B. MARCY, Chief of Staff:

Have rations cooked and ammunition issued to all the commands to-night, and have the men ready for action to-morrow without fatiguing them too much to-night. Have the works and all approaches on all possible bridges pushed to the utmost to-night, so that as many as possible may be practicable in the morning. Have the trains ready to pack. I have sent to Heintzelman and Keyes, and will communicate to you. Select carefully the positions for parking the trains, and have Stoneman and the command at Mechanicsville within hand. If the engineers cannot build the bridges to-night, commit the work to Porter and Franklin. I am sure Duane can do it. If they cannot, the sooner we get rid of the corps of engineers the better. Communicate this to Barnard. It is absolutely necessary that several bridges be practicable for artillery in the morning.

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 31, 1862.

Colonel COLBURN:

General Casey's division is entirely demoralized. Generals Casey and Palmer are reported killed and General Naglee wounded. I have been able to find but one colonel, and he says the men have nothing to eat.

C. McKEEVER,

Chief of Staff.

P. S.- It is reported that some of the regiments of General Peck's brigade have broken and dispersed.

HEADQUARTERS THIRD CORPS,May 31, 1862-10 p. m.

[General McCLELLAN:]

I have sent across Bottom's Bridge for our ammunition, and it will be up before daylight. My corps is supplied with three days' rations. General Keeyes thinks that General Couch's is supplied till to-morrow night. They are now issuing to General Casey's. General Casey's division cannot, however, be relied upon for any purpose whatever. The intrenching tools must be left at this place. We are much in want of them.

S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Brigadier-General.

HEADQUARTERS LEFT OF LINE,May 31, 1862.

Colonel COLBURN:

There is no hand-car, but the cars are expected every moment. I will take the locomotive and go down to Dispatch Station, or go on horseback, if they do not come in a few minutes.

S. P. HEINTZELMAN,

Brigadier-General.
