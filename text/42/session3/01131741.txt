1636) to plaee at the disposal of the Commis-
sioner of Internal Revenue certain copies of
the new compilation of internal revenue laws,
have instructed me to report it with amend-
ments. This ought to be passed at once:
there will be no otyection to it I am sure.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in
Committee ofthe Whole, proceeded to consider
the bill. It provides that seven thousand
copies ofthe new compilation of internal rev-
enue laws ordered by section forty-five of the
act of June 6, 1872, to be printed for the use
of Congress, which compilation is now in
press, be placed at the disposal of the Com-
missioner of Internal Revenue.

ing were in line three to insert the word "of
after the word " that," and to strike out from
line six to the end of the bill, in the following
words:

SOLDIERS' BURIAL GROUND IN MARYLAND. ,
Mr. WEST. The Committee on Military
Affairs, to whom was referred the bill (0. R.
No. 3794) to sell a vacated soldiers' burial
ground near Cumberland, Maryland, to the
Hebrew congregation of that city, to enlarge
their graveyard, have directed me to report it
back without amendment and with a favorable
recommendation,
Mr. HAMILTON, of Maryland. I ask the
unanimous consent of the Senate to consider
that bill at this time. It, is a very small bill,
simply authorizing the sale of a graveyard to
a church for the same purpose.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It directs the Secretary,of War,
on the payment to him of a sum of money
equal in amount to that paid for the property
when purchased by the United States, to con-
vey by proper deed to Samuel Sonneborne, H.
Stern, and Isaac Miller, in trust for the use
and benefit of the Hebrew congregation ofthe
city of Cumberland, Ma'ryland, ail the right,
title, and interest of the United States in and
to that parcel or lot of land, containing a
half acre more or less, situated about one mile
east of the -city of Cumberland, near the old
national road, or turnpike, and lying near and
adjacent to the burial-ground of the Hebrew
congregation, being' the same premises that
were purchased for the United States on or
about the 2d day of May, in the year 1862,
by Captain Hurtt, assistant, quartermaster as
a burial-ground for its soldiers stationed in
that vicinity during the late war, and which
has been made vacant by the removal of the
bodies there interred to Antietam or other
national cemeteries.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
CARE .Oi' SUBSISTENCE SUPPLIES.
Mr. WEST. I am directed by the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs, to whom was re-
ferred the bill (H. R. No. 3452) to provide for
the better care and protection of subsistence
supplies, to report it hack without amend-
ment, and to ask for the immediate consider-
ation of the bill, for the reason that it is in
the precise terms of a Senate bill that we
passed a few days ago, and by acting on this
bill at once the measure will become a law.
There being no objection, the Senate, as in
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It empowers the Secretary of
War to select' from the sergeauts of the line of
the Army who shall have faithfully served
therein five years, three years of which in the
grade of non-commissioned officer, as many
commissary sergeants as the service may re-
quire,, not to exceed one for each military post
or place of deposit of subsistence supplies,
whose duty it shall be to receive and preserve
the subsistence supplies at the posts, under
the direction, of the proper officers of the sub-
sistence department, and under such regula-
tions as shall be prescribed by the Secretary
of War. The comrriissary sergeants hereby
authorized are to be subject to the Rules and
Articles of War, and receive for their services
the same pay and allowances as ordnaace ser-
geants.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
