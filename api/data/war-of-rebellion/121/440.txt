Brigadier General JOHN. E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: Lieutenant Brown, of Kitchen's regiment of Missouri cavalry, while in discharge of his duty under written orders was captured in August, 1863, tried before a military court without any opportunities of defense being given, and sentenced to hard labor with ball and chain at Alton penitentiary during the war. He has already served out some sixteen months of his sentence. I have heretofore called your attention to this case without any favorable result. There are other officers and soldiers of the Confederate Army undergoing similar punishment. I hope it will not be necessary to bring to your notice any of these cases again.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, March 28, 1865.

Brigadier General JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: The following-named Confederate soldiers are now confined at Fort Warren, to wit: Robert H. Caldwell, Sixty-third Georgia, captured July 21, 1863; William Gantz (or Gautz), of Spate's [Spaight's] battalion, captured April 10, 1863; Matthew A. Beck, Ninth Florida, captured June 3, 1863; John P. Johns, Ninth Florida, captured May 31, 1863; John Wilson, Ninth Florida, captured May 31, 1863; Thomas W. Day, Ninth Florida, captured May 31, 1863; William D. Archer, Ninth Florida, captured April 12, 1863. You preceive that all these soldiers have been in captivity for a long time. I understand they are held as naval prisoners, though in fact they belong to the Confederate Army. It is probable they were captured by the U. S. Navy, and for that reason are so held. I will thank you to deliver these men as soon as you conveniently can. They are entitled to release on the score of their long confinement.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
