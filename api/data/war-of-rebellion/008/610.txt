Brigadier General FRED. STEELE, Pilot Knob:

You will not advance so as to endanger your command. You will soon be re-enforced, either from General Pope or Saint Louis.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, March 13, 1862.

Major-General POPE:

It is reported that the enemy has about 5,000 men at Pitman's Ferry and Pocahontas. Can you spare the two regiments of Michigan cavalry? If so, send them to re-enforce General Steele, who is now at Greenville, moving on Martinsburg, with a detachment at Poplar Bluff. It is said that with slight repairs the road from Sikeston by Bloomfield and Saint Francisville will be practicable. Answer.

NEAR NEW MADRID, March 13, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

Your dispatch of this date received. The enemy have been so largely re-enforced as to be very nearly equal in numbers to myself. He is quite so in the absence of one brigade of four regiments at Point Pleasant. The large detachment required to work in and guard the trenches makes my security depend upon the cavalry force here. The unaccountable delay of our gunboats has forced me to establish batteries and push regular approaches to the bank of the river, os that I can establish the heavy guns necessary to drive off the gunboats. The details for such work and of the guards for the trenches are so large necessarily that I fear to detach any portion of this force, especially the cavalry. It is evident that the enemy design to defend this place desperately. Their whole force, except gunners, has been sent here from Island Numbers 10.

I am very sorry, and, as you know, not disposed to be overcautious, but I should regard it as very unsafe to detach a man from this place. I have called forward everything I had in the district except the guards necessary for the railroad.

COMMANDING OFFICERS U. S. FORCES,

En route for Kansas:

SIR: I have routed the combined forces of Van Dorn, Price, McCulloch, and Pike in a three days' encounter at Pea Ridge. My advance of calvary is at Bentonville. There is a good place to camp 2 1/2 miles west of Bentonville. Also at any point on Little Sugar Creek.
