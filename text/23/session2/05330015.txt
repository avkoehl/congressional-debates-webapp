1834.                                THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                                     Í5
count if dehveied in five days,) and consequent
loss of interest, could, with such aseignoragc,and
the advantages now authouzed fiom the Ticas-
ury, be, without inconv emence, i educed to eight or
ten days, and the whole establishment be thus sus-
•ained by its own earnings without much, if any,
lncicased cost to either mmvidaals oi the public
But, in such case, if the  cost should evei  be
mcicased to individuals, some additional induce-
ment will be held out to prevent either the export-
ation oi melting of oui com, which has been so I
great hitheito, before the late change in the law,
as to have 1 ft in deposit and cnouiation in this '
countiy an amount of it not exceeding thatstiuek
in tw o oi thiec out of the forty years dunng which t
the  Mint has been in opei ition.    The expenses
and lubois of the Mint equaling, on an aveiage, '
about twenty thousand dol'ais a yeai,oi eight I
bundled thousand dolíais in all, excluding build- |
ings, have thus, except foi about two ycais,been j
entiiely lost to the countiy                                        |
It has been dtsnable to attempt some impiove-
ments in the re-venue cuttei scivice     With such
a view, all its regulations have been revised and I
republished     By those, it has been endtavoied ¡
to piomote the cause of tempeianee, and thereby I
to mciease the health and efficiency of the ciews, 1
and the safety of the public propel ty and the public
interests m this bianch of seivice,by holding out
a similai inducement to that now existing in the
Navy to discontinue the use of spn it on shipboai d
Grcatei secuiity has been piovided foi the prompt
payment of then wages, and foi official account-
ability     It has further been deemed expedient,
not only to stop any contemplated incitase in the
cutttis, but to reduce the number of them, and of
the persons employed in this scivice, as lapidly
as tht dmi'inshed temptation to smuggling will
safely peimit
By scvcialiesolutions, appropriations, and ac+s
of Congiess, at the last and pievious sessions, a
vanity of othei subjects, not yet rcpoited on, has
been confided to the attention of this D< paitment,
such as the election of a number of custom-
houses, the building of a budge ovti the Potomac
nvei in this District, a compiomise of the suits
pending against the film of Thomas H Smith &
Son, an opinion on the validity of some piivate land
titles in Missoun,arepoiton ccitainpiovisions m
thetauffactof July 14,1832, some statements as to
the marine hospital money, a íeoigamzation of the
Tieasury Dcp utment, and a íevision of the sub-
ject of salaues and fees to custom-bouse officers
These have itetived careful attention, and will
foim the subjects of senaiate repoits toCongiesa
caily in the pitsent session
In the rtpoit on the last of them, it is contera- ¡
plated to offei such suggestions, by way of ad-
dition to this communication,as die appiopiiately
connected with that inquiry, and as would othei   !
wise have been mentioned net m respect to some I
thangts detined suitable m the whole amount of '
compensation to vanous custom house officeis,
and in the numbei   of such  officcis, at vauou 
poits, and   in lcKtion  to othei   changes in tht
system, which the gieat alterations m the exist
mg duties stem to indicate as íequned foi sound
economy and tht public convenience
A few remaiks concerning hospital money will
also be postponed, and annexed to the statements
lequested in i elation to that subject
In the prepaiation of new weights and meas-
uies, on the authouty given m the act of 2d
Maich, 1799, and on tht pimuplcs set foith in a
íepoit fiom this Department of June 20, 1832,
coupled with the piovision on this subject in tht
Constitution, some piogicss has been made since
tht date ot that itpoit But tin di'Th ulty m pio-
eunng the most suitable materials fi om abioad has
u tii Jed tht completion of the work, and the pies
ent engagements of the distinguished gentleman
speciauy employed to supenntend this business,
and which engioss most of his ame, m asm icy
of the coast, may, with the encumstance before
named, pitvtnttlie final accomplishment of this
desnable object another ytai But it is hoptd
that then, eithti at the aistnal in this city, oi at
tlu Mint, the most natuial and appioprrvtt place,
tht new weights and measures will be satisfacto-
ry finished, and gitatti unifoimity and accu-
raty ittame d on i subject which, both as to lev-
( mu and eommtice, it is much needed, and will
piove eminently ustful to the public
The survey of the coast before alluded to has,
sinet the last annual repoit, been transfeired to
the chaige of the Navy Depaitmtnt, with which
it seems to be more intimately and appropuately
connected With this suney, the situation and
utility of our piesent light houses, aheady being
one hundied and ninety-nine in number, besides
twenty light-boats, ano! the necessity for othei s,
fiom time to time, would seem to be,m some de-
gree, fitly associated As a measuie likely to
lead to economy, in not extending the establish-
ment of light-houses beyond the leal wants of
the countiy, and in fixing then exact localities,
so impoitant to th" safety of oui navigation and
Navy, it is íespectíully recommended that, in the
sui vcy now in piogiess, Congitss should lequne
the latitude and longitude of every light-house to
be caiefully ascertained and published, the ím
poitance of its position to be inquiied into, and
that no new one be hcieaftei elected till a report
is made, in respect to its public benefits, by the
two collectors and the commandei of the navy-
yard neaiest the proposed site
Hie rebuilding of the Trcasmv edifice, on or
near its foimer location, with the dimensions of
the building enlaiged so as to meet the wants of
the Dtpaitment, and rendered fire-pioof for the
secuiity of its popéis, seems indispensable to lis
convenient operations, and to the safety of some
of the most valuable lecords connected with the
public ai chives
The report fiom the Commissioner of the Gen-
eral Land Office is annexed Many of its sug-
gestions aie highly impoitant, and some of the
recommendations, as to changes in this bianeh
of the collections of the public money, are re-
spectfully, though earnestly, uiged on the con-
sideration of Congitss
Tht Indian titlts having, of late yeais, been
moie extensively extinguished, the quantity of
valuable lands bi ought into maiktt has mci eased
in amount, so as to place m the Tieasuty over
three millions annually, instead of about one mil-
lion, as was the case twenty years ago Within
the same period the land offices have augmented
in numbei fiom about eighteen to fifty-tlnce, in
actual operation in 1834 These eneumstances
have added much to the business of that buitau,
and should cleaily lead to a coiitspondmg m
cieasem itscleiks,oi a sepaiation fiom it of some
of its piesent ¡abonous duties, as the diminution
in othei business, in some othei buieaus, might
lead to reductions m tht number of then clerks,
to the extent proposed in the plan soon to be sub
mittedjin the reoiganization of the TieasuiyDe-
paitmtnt Attempts have been made, timing the
past year, with some success, to simplify tht
mode of making cntnts m the Geneial Land Of-
fice of the salts effected, some difficult and long-
delayed questions of accounts have been decided,
gieatei local accommodations and facilities fur-
nished to the offitt, and meieased convenience
and piomptitude, as fai as piacticable with the
pie,scnt force of the buicau, have been mtioductd
m the asceitainmcnt of titles, end m the collect on
and disbuisement of the hige amount of n venue
deuved fiom thissouice But new legislation can
alone give entire lehef, m tht piesent condition
of its enlarged duties, vnd at least $30,000 a ycai,
foi ten yeais, will be íequned to be expended, m

beyond the whole amount of its available funds,
oí $195,208 40
The expenses for the transportation of the
mail necessanly continued undiminished till the
close of the year 1833, prior to which date the re-
tí enchments stated in that repoi t could not take ef-
fect, consequently, the balance of debt against the
Depaitment continued to augment till that period.
The gioss amount of postages was, from July
1st to December 31,1833.........$1,375,437 28
Compensation to postmasters, in-
cluding the contingent expenses
of their offices dunng the same

And the balance of the debt against----------------
the Depaitment beyond the amount
of its available funds was, on the

Tiom the 1st of January, 1734, the íetiench-
ments in the transpoi tation of the mail, stated in
my íepoit of last yi ai, began to take effect, and
ftom that peííod tht icvenues of the Department
have exceeded its evptiists
The gioss amount of postage was, fiom Jan-
uai j 1 to June 30, 1834........    $1,448,269 69

$1,400,762 45
47,507 24
315,599 98
$268,092 74
Such was the financial condition of the Depart-
ment on tht 1st day of July last The amount
of this debt has been continually diminishing to
the piesent time, and it continues to dimmish in
an increased 'atio         ,
On the 1st day of July, 1834, the balance of
the account with banks was $398,616 09 agamst
the Depaitmtnt, consisting of loans, $275,000,
and over checks to the amount of $123,616 99
I In this statement, the diffeience between loans
and ovti checks is íathei nominal than essential
When ovti-checks aie mutually agreed upon
to a ceitam definite amount as a standing oidor,
thc> die called loans, but when they vaiy indefi-
nitely as to time and amount, they are called
ovei-checks In eithei case they are debts due
Í fiom the Depaitment to banks.
