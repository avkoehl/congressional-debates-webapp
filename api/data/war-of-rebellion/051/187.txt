the enemy in his breastworks, under showers of musket balls and terrific roar of artillery, and amid exploding shells,a nd when this gallant brigade was being cut down, wavering, hesitating, and faltering. I caused my guns to be run by hand upon a small elevation to within 170 yards of the enemy's fortifications, and I poured double charges of canister into them so hotly and briskly that a brief space had elapsed before their battery was silenced and their infantry so demoralized that they fled in haste from their covering to the rear.

To form a correct estimate of execution done by this battery I will mention that a lieutenant (a prisoner) of the Sixteenth U. S. Regulars states that two shots of canister from my guns killed and wounded 38 of his company, killing his captain.

General Polk's brigade at this auspicious moment rushed forward and scaled the enemy's fortifications, putting the Federal forces at that point in utter route and confusion.

During the several engagements I had 1 mortally and 5 men slightly wounded, 3 of whom have returned to duty. Three horses in the battery were killed, but the harness was secured.

On Sunday, jointly with the brigade, I captured and carried off 2 rifled pieces of artillery and 1 caisson full of ammunition.*

With due regard.

THOMAS J. KEY,

First Lieutenant, Commanding Calvert's Battery.

[Brigadier General L. E. POLK.]
