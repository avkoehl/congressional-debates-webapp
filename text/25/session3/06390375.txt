Public Defaulters—Mr. Underwood.
Ho, of Reps.
benefactions to his fellow-citizens, and which,
with him, are the cnief considerations imparting
value to office The Father of his Counti y knew
the -value of office and station- in these respects
The modern office-holder tests its value by dollars
and cents Ami think you, sir, when, by com-
binations, and all sorts of deceptions, tucks, and
artifices, power is obtained, those who get the
power intend to iclinquish the dollars and cents—
to give up the end and aim of all their struggles'
No, sir, thev will do no such thing Those who
fight for " spoils,"ifvictoiy is theirs, will not be
testrained by the commander in-chief after the
battle is ova He is compelled by his position,
as the commander of such soldiers, to yield to
their wishes They will exact a compliance on
h.s part with the conditions of their enlistment,
and would decapitate their general sooner than
be restrained in the work of plunder It is not
at all suiprism?, wlten a man obtains office by
such means,and with such motives, that he should
forget the Divine injunction, " Servants be con
tent with your lawful wages "
The remote causes of the deplorable defalca-
tions which exist are to be found in the system
introduced in the beginning oí the last Adrmnis-
tiation, of removing officetsfot opinions honestly
entertemed, and appointing others in their places
whose subseiviency to the will of the President,
Rnd devotion to the inteiests of party, constituted
thou puncipal recommendation Since the intro-
ductionof this system,partycontests nave thrown
then blighting influences overus, embittering the
fechng3 of society, and thieatemngdestiuction to
our republican institutions With the servile and
selfish horde who fallow aftei the loaves and
fishes, the only question is, how can we elect our
man to the Piesidency > Success secuies to the
foi túnate paity food, íaiment, and shelter, and
leaves to the disappointed poverty and sufteung
Í hese conflicts oí parly have mingled themselves
With all the operations of out Governments, both
State and national, piostiating in then tomado
violence the pnnciples of law and Constitution,
until the piospect before us is one of desolation
It has alieady come to this, that a constable can
not be chosen by a county court without first
knowing who he voted for, or intends to vote for,
as President Members of Congiess are elected
because they are favoiable or opposed to this or
that candidate foi the Piesidency, and when they
take their seats on this floor, should then polit-
ical chief occupy the Executive mansion, the
creed of party lequires them to follow his dicta-
tion, right or wrong, and generally, if not inva
i lably, they do it Thus it is that the will of the
President is paramount to the will of the people,
and the representative forgets his constituents,
and surrenders himself to Executive control
Presidential electioneenng connects itself in an
alarming mannet with the dehbeiations and acts
ef Congiess The public lands and the public
money aie disposed of, not with a view to pio-
duce the gieatest possible good to the gieatest
number, but with a tiew to sustain the membeis
of a patty, and to perpetuate power in the same
or kinetied hands
Thus, su, you bid for the votes of the new
States, and pay with the public lands and you
grant millions to lemove an oyster shoal oi a
sand-bar at the mouth of a cieek emptying into
the sea or lakes, and refuse to appiopuate a dol-
lar to impiove the livers of the interioi, unless
they are of such magnitude as to interest two or
more States Do not suppose I am again about
to contrast Gieen liver with New river, " the
Noith Carolina Spung branch," as I said on
another occasion, nor shall T detain you by draw
ing a paiallel between the Cumberland road and
the roads leading thiough Kentucky I have done
this heretofoie, foi the purpose of placing before
my constituents the glaiin  injustice of your le-
gislation It is with heaitfelt exultation that I
infoim this House that theie is now neaily one
lmndied miles, of the finest nat igation in the woild
leady for use on Gieen mer, and in twelve
months from this time theie will be double that
number It is ill the woik of Kentucky and,
sn,«e aie goinff ehead with om toad  m the
Bdiric maim i, e'ymg u[ on the State, without
coming heie to beg favors Gut, sir, I glancp at
these things for the puipose of asking whether
any man supposes these palpable inequalities
could exist for a moment but to subserve polit-
ical pui poses, and to advance the interests of par-
ticulai individuals, instead of the general welfare.
With an empty Treasury you vote hundreds of
thousands to the Cumbeiland toad, you go in
debt to keep that work in progress, and you at-
tempt to leconcile the nation to your conduct by
two flimsy pretexts one, the idea of indemnity
for the expenditure out of the two per cent fund,
the other, the idea that the public faith ispledged
to finish the woik These ideas, without a sha-
dow of foundation foi either of them, ate played
off upon a confiding and deceived people to recon-
cile them to the grossest partiality.
I have a íemedy, and I shall prescribe before I
take my seat I have been greatly amused in the
couise of this discussion, and, as a prelude to
stating my own, I propose to notice briefly the
remedies proposed by others
The gentleman fiom Virginia [Mr Wise] rec-
ommends a "general tutn-out" of the official
coips That many ought to be " turned out" of
office 1 do not doubt But weie all that accom-
plished , it would avail nothing unless a better set
can be found to fill their places I íemember the
fable of the fox and the flies I do not wartt a
new swaim to suck the íemaining blood of an
exhausted people I desire those who come
hereaftei may bring healing in their wings, and
not the appetites and piobosces of galhnippers *
If it be no more than a paitisan war between mi
and oitfs that now agitates the nation, I piedict
that no good will lesult fiom its termination in
fivoi of (ithei party 1 have but little confi-
dence in those of any paity who make politics a
ti ido to live by With such, money is the main
ob]cct, and when they obtain powei they aie vciy
apt to use it foi purposes of legal, if not criminal,
plunder I mean, by the term " legal plundei,"
that they will, by immoial, paitial, and even vile
legislation, piomote private and sectional inter
ests at the expense and to the detnment of the
people at laige, that they will legalize iniquity
[A membei was heaid to say, " the Whigs
would not do so "J I hone and believe they
will not, but the " turn-out" remedy, even if it
should succeed in a great degree, will not effect-
ually eradicate the disease It will do no good to
tuin the hogs out unless you stop the holes My
remedy is to repair the fence
But, sir, I have another and a stiong objection
to the "general turn out"iemedy. Such a couise
would be to follow the delete nous example set hy
our political adveisines It would be to punish
for opinion's sake, and to uvet upon the Ameri-
can people the odious practice of making the of-
fices of Government nothing moie noi less than
stakes put up to be played foi by pohtieal gam-
bleis Su, there is gieat danger, fiom the temper
oí the times, that such will be the future piactice
of all paities in this counti y I will read you,
by way of sample,what the fnemhof the mently
elected Vemociatic Governor of Mai y land dictate
to him The paper called the Washington County
Democrat says
" I here hi? been 1 greit dell of «peenlitmn as to the

The Baltimore Republican gives its dictum in
staring capitals thus " Wl say, dismiss them
to a mi. " Not even an exception is to be tol-
erated Thus, sir, it has become " Democratic"
in these days to exact that a " Democratic" Gov-
ernor shall play the tyrant, to dischaige the deuts
he "owes to lusfnends," hy removing fiom office
all political opponents, no matter how great miy
be their qualifications in point of fidelity, integ
lity, mdustiy and talent' When this shaU be
come ti e bet led practice of the national ind State

ger) upon the election of a ntw Pxecutive then,
tiuly, "the post of honor will be the pnvate sta-
tion "   Then men of highmoial and nitelkctual

worth, engaged in the various avocations of life,
and the humble and honest, yet less gifted, but
equally meritorious citizens, who earn a support
for his beloved family by the sweat of his face,
will stand aloof from politicalcoiruption and offi-
cial plunder, until they become intolerable, and
when that peuod arrives, they will stand by their
arms.
But, sir, can we get a better set to fill the vacant
places upon a ''general tuin-out'" It will be
veiy difficult to do, if the ideas of the gentleman
from South Carolina [Mr Pickens] be correct.
He seems to think that the accumulation and ap-
propnation of immense sums of money by this
Government is the true cause of the recent defal-
cations, and lus remedy, therefore, is to diy up
the sources of revenue He supposes that human
nature cannot withstand the temptation which
immense piles of burnished gold present, and
therefore concludes that our condition will not
change for the better until the leaislation of Con-
gress takes a new direction He thinks corpu-
lency is the disease, and that depletion and stai va-
tion constitute the proper remedy I admit, sir,
thata knaveoi athref, befoie perpetrating a ciime,
usually considers the chances of escape and de-
tection, and hence, if he were about to steal a
tuin of corn, he would prefer going to the cub
and shelling out for himself, rather than take the
full bag already prepared foi themill The owner
might not miss the two bushels and a half taken
out of the heap He would at once discover he
had been robbed if the full hag disappears, and
hot pursuit might ensue. But this reasoning is
not at all applicable to filching money fiom the
Iieasuty Whethei theie be overflowing mil-
lions, oi whether it be reduced to the last turn,
the amount is, or ought to be, accurately meas-
ured up, and, if a cent is subtracted, you ascer-
tain the loss with mathematical accuracy The
depredator meets with no eneouragi ment, there-
fore, in the íeflecüon that he may escape detec-
tion by stealing a large pile or heap Is the
temptation increased in pioportion to the magni-
tude of the treasure' I think not There aie
stories extant of generous tobbers, who plunder
the rich to give to the poor, but 1 apprehend we
cannot with tiuth attribute any palliating senti-
ment of that sort to oui official defaulteis, in ex-
tenuation of their conduct No, sir The Holy
Book says
" Hiere is a generation whole teeth are as swords ind
iheirjaw teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the
eirth, ind the needy irom among men "
Doubtless the text was prophetically uttered
in lefetencc to the sub Treasuiy defaulters of this
counti y at the present day. They have no sen-
timent that does not concentrate in self They do
not steal in consequence of the magnitude of the
treasure, ot the ability of the Government to sus-
tain the loss No, sir Unrestiained by moial
principles, they aie under the dominion of vicious
propensities, and care not into what crime they
steep then hands, provided it can be done with
impunity Their motives of action are to be found
in then own inbied coiruptions,and notm tempt-
ations from without The fault lies in placing
such men in situations wheie they can act out
their principles Office has not made them rogues,
but office has furnished oppoitumtiesfoi them to
manifest what they always were The public
money can never be safe m the hands or such
men, and the remedy is to find men of different
chaiicters And, su, they can be found, provid-
ed you will hunt foi them in those walks of Ufe
wheie the noisy, lying, sycophantic, calumniating
putisan—the vile tool of party—is nevei a wel-
come guest I claim no preeminence foi my con-
stituents over those of any othei member, but I
will venture to asbeit that I could select in my
own distuctmen enough, who could and would
receive, keep, and disburse eveiy dollar of our
vast íevenue, without fraudulently misapplying
one cent I would tike those who succeeded in
then business as fainuis, mechanics, meichants,
and piofessional men, and not thobe who made
polines a tiade as the i dernier resoit I would
pa«s by those who believe the chief good consists
in the pos&c.s«ion of lion chests ciammed with
yellow coins stamped with the likeness of soma
loyal tool, ind select those content with the cora-
foits of life, earned by then own mdustiy, and.
