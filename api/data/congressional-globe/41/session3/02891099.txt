No. 2914} making an appropriation for the
contingent fund of the House of Representa-
tives, have directed me to report it back with-
out amendment and to ask for its present

sider the bill. It appropriates the sum of

RED RIVER VALLEY AND SANTA FE RAILROAD.
Mr. HOWARD. The Committee on the

bill (S. No. 1287) to incorporate the Red
River Valley, Oklahoma, and Santa F6 Rail-
road Company, have had the same under con-
sideration, and directed me to report it with
an amendment. I beg to say in reference to
this bill that it asks for no subsidy in money
or lands at all, but simply for the right of way
through the Indian territory and other Terri-
tories of the United States.
Mr. FLANAGAN. I rise to ask the Senate
to consider that bill now. I have not here-
tofore during this session asked the Senate
to take up any bill, and I hope they will now
grant me this favor. The bill just reported
asks for no subsidy in money or lands. It is
plain and simple, and I shall be very thankful
for immediate'action upon it. It will take but
a few minutes.
Mr. ANTHONY. If it takes no time I will
oonsent,
Mr. FLANAGAN. None at all. If it does
I will withdraw the demand instantly.

The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the bill,
but was interrupted by
Mr. COLE. I regret very much to do so,
but I am under a sort of obligation to the Com-
mittee on Appropriations to object to this sort
of business. This bill will take the whole of
the morning hour, and I understand we are to
go into executive session in a short time. This
bill, which is evidently a very long one, can be
read at some evening session, and we can then
dispose of it. I shall be very glad to assist
its passage when the proper time comes.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
states that there are ten pages more of the bill
to read.
Mr. COLE. How many have already been
read ? I am afraid this bill will take the whole
morning hour.

have been read.

made, the bill cannot be considered to.-day.
