Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, Greeneville, February 28, 1864.

Brigadier General B. R. JOHNSON,Commanding Division:

Your favor of the 27th has been received. The lieutenant-general commanding thinks that you might find a better line for your infantry on the line between Warrensburg, Cosby, and Bull's Gap that in its present position in the gaps.

You might hold the gaps with cavalry only. This line would unite your infantry more, and connect you more readily with the force in Bull's Gap.

Will you examine the ground in regard to this disposition of your troops, and report the result?

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

OSMAN LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
