MOSCOW, December 5, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Couriers just in from near Mount Pleasant came upon rear guard of rebels, who were moving south; between 20 and 30 dead rebels found on the field. Their dead and wounded scattered along the road. They carried away six wagons loaded. Citizens say they acknowledge being badly whipped. Their loss in killed and wounded certainly over 100, probably 150. I am, looking every moment for train from Corinth.

General TUTTLE,

La Grange:

Courier arrived from Collierville in the night. Enemy burned La Fayette, but did not capture the post. They have fallen back on Collierville. Grissom's Bridge is burnt. I have ordered Mizner to remain at Saulsbury or Grand Junction. Negro scout I sent out last night reports the enemy camped near Mount Pleasant. I am sending out what cavalry I have here to reconnoiter. An attack is feared at Collierville. Send patrols of Seventh Illinois and Second Iowa to this point. Is there any news from Corinth? I will dispatch General Hurlbut this morning.

B. H. GRIERSON.

Brigadier-General.

MOSCOW, December 5, 1863.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Communication with Corinth all right. Colonel Mizner has again been as far south as Ripley. All quiet on that end of the line. Forrest crossed the Hatchie at Bolivar, and reported going to Jackson. No definite information with regard to his force. Enemy have burned Grissom's Bridge and La Fayette. Scout, whom I sent out last night, reports the enemy encamped near Mount Pleasant. Rail road will be in running order from here to Corinth to-day. Fight pretty sharp here yesterday; our loss 4 or 5 killed and about 20 wounded. Hatch wounded through the right lung, but doing well this morning. Fifteen dead rebels are found on the field so far; their loss much heavier than ours. The Sixth Illinois lost heavy in horses, 30 or 40 killed. I am sending patrol to Mount Pleasant to report back to Morgan at La Fayette.

Colonel MIZNER,

La Grange:

Patrols report Lee passed through Holly Springs going to Okolona. Move east with your command and dispose it so as to guard the line.
