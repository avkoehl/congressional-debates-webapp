Major General J. J. REYNOLDS,

Commanding Department of Arkansas, Little Rock:

GENERAL: I have official notice that commissioners are on the point of starting from Fort Leavenworth for Fort Smith with escort and attendance to negotiate a lasting treaty with Indians residing west of You. You will please make all suitable arrangements for their comfort at Fort Smith, and facilitate their business by all the means at Your command. Supply them with provisions, forage, and all necessaries. Also take proper precautions as to guards, couriers, &amp;c., reporting at the close of the treaty any matters that may seem to You of interest.

I am, with great respect,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Saint Louis, August 22, 1865.

DEAR REYNOLDS: I have not written You much, became I did not feel inclined to meddle much in Your matters, which You understand far better than I. I am now firmly established here, and will always be glad to be of service to You officially and privately. I want to come down some time this winter to see You, of which more hereafter. I shall be glad if You will drop me a note privately, telling me of matters interesting, though not strictly private.

Your friend,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

ALKALI, August 22, 1865.

Major G. C. TICHENOR,

Aide-de-Camp:

Send orders to General Sanborn to send to Leavenworth what cavalry he can spare for muster out. I advise in retaining to keep Fourteenth Missouri, Thirteenth Missouri, and Fifteenth Kansas, and First Colorado. He can send in such of the rest as he deems best, or even part of this. Tell him it is reported that a part of the Comanches, Kiowas, nearly all of the Cheyennes, and one band of Arapahoes are still north of Platte. Ascertain what portions of these tribes, if any, are there. I will communicate to him from Julesburg.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

Send to Fort Cottonwood six pieces of field artillery, caissons and forage complete. Send ammunition with them. Let mule teams take them out, and put all under charge of a suitable officer, who will obtain escort from post to post. All Cottonwood I will send orders for their distribution.

G. M. DODGE,
