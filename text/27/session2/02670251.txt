Mr McKEON moved to a ntnd this  i'era by striking out the

Mr GENTRY mse toa point of ordei The House havm

The CHAIRMAN said the bill would up lead by claires

Mr McKEXTS remarked that there had been so mm} and

quired atom hands It might be said the Executive branch
mu«t have these sums, e id the lesponsibilrty w«st rest there
Wheiever responsibility might rest, at least on the members of
this House it would unquestionably rest The Executive
could not get one cent without our votes, and to ask members
who believed iu the propriety of Mr Jefferson's rule of specific
appioprmtiona foi upwards of a million of dollars on eoatm
gencies and miscellaneous items, was to put them to asevera
test No one could deny that there must besóme contingencies.
There must be some piovision for small items which cannot
lie entimented But no oae willaasert that, under contingent
cíes, expenditures should be authorized by cleiks and heads of
Departments which this House nevei would sanction if called
on directly to vote upon them Have gentlemen examined the
