By command of the Secretary of War:

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 19, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

General McCown reports General Buell with his whole force (probably 20,000 or 30,000) in the vicinity of Stevenson and Battle Creek and daily expected to attack Chattanooga. Colonel Forrest, who was sent into Middle Tennessee, has recently taken Murfreesborough, capturing 2 brigadier-generals, 1,200 men, and a field battery. This may delay General Buell's movement and give General Bragg time to move on Middle Tennessee. The safety of Chattanooga depends upon his cooperation.

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 20, 1862.

Major General JOHN P. McCOWN, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Dispatch Forrest to retire before being involved by Buell's army. If he retreats by Pikeville toward Washington and be pressed send him supporting force by railroad via Athens to protect his crossing at Washington or to such point on the river as may be necessary.

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

KNOXVILLE, TENN., July 20, 1862.

Major General JOHN P. McCOWN, Chattanooga, Tenn.:

Telegraph General Bragg any reliable information you may have. Keep him posted. His co-operation with the force in East Tennessee is all-important.

E. KIRBY SMITH,

Major-General, Commanding.
