My cavalry scouts are to-day amusing themselves with the enemy at Malvern Hill. Jackson's movements may be against Buell. The fact of his taking the Gordonsville route would in that case be accounted for by the necessity of their keeping the Petersburg and Danville roads free for the transit of wounded, recruits, and supplies. In any event I try to urge concentration of the masses of troops in front of Washington and the sending of cavalry far to the front. If I am to have Burnside's troops, I would be glad to avail myself of at least a portion of them to occupy a point on south bank of James River. Health of the command improving a little. I should be glad to hear daily from Pope's outpost. It is important that I should do so.

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF VIRGINIA.

Washington, July 20, 1862.

Major-General McCLELLAN, Berkeley:

Ewell is at Gordonsville with about 6,000 men. Jackson reported to be at Louisa Court-House with 25,000.

My advance posts are at Culpeper and Madison Court-House. It is certain that a considerable force of the enemy is along Virginia Central Railroad west of Hanover Junction.
