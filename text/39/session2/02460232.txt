Treasury Bepaetmekt,
KegiSTKK's Ol'FICE, December S, 1866,
S. B. COLBY, Register.
The accounts are made up at the Treasury
Department, not for each session, but for each
Congress, the whole term of two years included.
For that reason the estimate has not been
presented for this Thirty-Ninth Congress.
The increase of salary effected by the act of Jul?
last will for this Congress be about $1,000,000
J3rom this the Treasury saves in reduction
of mueaga by that act about  250,000
The increased expense, therefore, for the
entire Congress is about.  7,-sn nno
Or for each year about  " oTo'lJOO
If the mileage should be reduced to )0 cent's
per mile it would save to the Treasury
with our present number of Senator* and
Representatives annually about  $12-5,000
From this it will be seen the bills under eon-
sideratioa are naeasures of retrenchment and
economy.
This Congress is upon the record in favor of
every just measure necessary to accomplish
objects so desirable.
Soon we are to have the report of " the
joint select committee on retrenchment," un-
der the resolution of the 18th of July last,
which direeted an inquiry—
"into the expenditures in all the branches of the
service of the United States"—
with directions to—
"report whether any audi
abolished j whether any and
ances ought to be reduced,"
report whether any and what offices ought to he
.,nj} what salaries or allow-
- — — * - — — n — - ™ " "" . vuuvuu." £|j.
And the reasons for all this, as recited in
the preamble, are that—
" The financial condition of the United States de-
mands the exercise of a rigid_ economy in all depart-
ments of the Government, in order to sustain the
credit of the United States, and to relieve the peo-
ple at the earliest possible day from the burdens of
existing taxation."
This resolution and these reasons were ap
proved, I believe, by every member of the
Union party in this Congress, and by theloyal
people of the whole country. And as it was
once enjoined that repentance 11 should be
preached among all nations beginning at Jeru-
salem," (Luke xxiv, 27,) so should this Con-
gress, in obedience to the manifest popular will,
provide for all necessary and proper retrench-
ment in every department, beginning at Wash-
ington.
Before considering the question as to what is
the just measure of compensation, I may say in
general terms there are reasons of an impera-
tive character in favor of the most moderate
amount compatible with justice and safety.
The legislative department determines by law
the amount of the salaries or fees of all officers
of the Government. To some extent the
compensation in the legislative department is
regarded as a standard in determining that of
other departments or officers. With profuse
liberality in legislative compensation, Congress
cannot by any rule of equality demand even
moderate, much less 1' rigid economy,'' in the
amount of pay allowed t.o other departments.
Nor can the vast army of officers now necessary
to administer the Government ever hope to
successfully demand exorbitant salaries from
a legislative body limiting itself to moderate
compensation.
One of the most eminent jurists of this or any
age, of whom our nation is justly proud, Mr.
Justice Story, that solid legal philosopher, add-
ing as he did to his other attainments a matured
judgment upon political ethics, political econ-
omy, and social science, in discussing this sub-
ject of legislative compensation, has given us
another view in the interest of philanthropy in
favor of the position I am endeavoring to main-
tain. He says:
" There is no danger that the want of compensation
would deter men of suitable talents and virtues"
* * * * "from becoming members." s
* • *■ "And if in a few eases it should be
otherwise, it should not be forgotten that one of the
most wholesome lescous to be taught in republics 13
that men should learn suitable economy and pru-
dence m their private affairs."—1 Story on ConntUu-
tton, section 865; Suger's Speech, March 7,1816; An-
nais of Congress, 1S17-18, first session, page 11(>5;
Desha's Speech, January 6,1818; Annals, 1817-18, first
session, page 571.
The example of other nations admonishes us
that enormous salaries are followed by extrav-
agant and luxurious modes of living, incom-
patible with republican simplicity if not with
private virtue. The evil, once inaugurated,-like
a pestilent contagion contaminates the body-
politic, subverts the social and domestic rela-
tions, introduces corruption and licentious-
ness destructive of republican institutions and
Christian civilization. It divides society into
classes by building up one at the expense of
another, inconsistent with the whole theory of
our institutions. To preserve the purity of
Government, the unscrupulous should not be
encouraged by extravagant salaries to embark
in corrupt scrambles for office, which, when
attained, may supply the means of perpetuating
power in bad hands and of destroying,the purity
of the ballot for such ignoble purposes.
I do not pretend that we have yet embarked
upon that dangerous system of ioilding up
official aristocratic classes so patiently submit-
ted to m other nations of the past and present,
but every step tending in the slightest degree
m that direction should be watched with a
jealous eye.
, There is another extreme which justice and
sound policy require us to avoid. An inade-
quate compensation to any officer of the Gov-
ffS?16?', is alike unreasonable and unjust,
i he laborer is worthy of his hire."
If no compensation, or an inadequate one, be
paid to members of the legislative department,
those in indigent circumstances but with sur-
passing merits and talents will be practically
excluded from becoming candidates for con-
gressional honors and duties. The Constitution
has wisely settled this by providing that—
" The Senators and Representatives shall receive
a compensation for their services to be ascertained
by law."
This would seem to be imperative, perhaps
to avoid the possibility of distinctions among
members, ana it was designed to abrogate the
practice in England; in considering which,
Eawle has very justly said;
In respect to the members of the Legislature,
LCongress, j onrpraetice corresponds with that of soma
though not all the nations of Europe. In one, to
which we a,re apt more frequently to look than gay
other, [England,] the ancient usage has melted away,
and the members of Parliament dot? receive bo com-
pensation for their attendance* The consequence is,
that only men of fortune can take seats in tile House
of Commons. This is inconsistent with the equality
that ought to be found in a republic."—Rawte on
o-n ^tory °n Constitution, section
ooi; 1 Jjlaoksione's Commentaries 174.
I am not unmindful of the fact that many
plausible reasons have been urged in favor of
liberal or large compensation.
It was long ago said in the debates in Con-
gress ia favor of an increase of salaries, thai—
" This addition of pay would lessen the anxiety and
necessity for executive favors and appointments, and
that executive influence and control in and over
that body would be thereby diminished."—Artrtals
of Congress 1815-16, first session, page 1165,
No such consideration was urged in favor
of the act of July last, and fortunately our
experience demonstrates that American Sen-
ators and Representatives are not readily
bought by executive influence, and if any are,
they are of a class nofc worthy of being saved
by large salaries, if that were possible.
It has been frequently urged, too, that lib-
eral salaries were essential to preserve the
purity of Congress and to remove the tempta-
tions to and dangers of corruption.
The true corrective for these dangers, if they
could exist, will be found in the lessons of
economy inspired by just salaries, and still
more in the intelligence and purity of the
voters, and the restraining penalties which may
be imposed by Congress or by the lawg. (An-
nals Fourteenth Congress, firstsession, 1815-16,
page 1166, and Fifteenth Congress, first ses-
sion, 1817-18. page 571; Desha's Speech.) But
in practice it is safe to assert that congressional
purity which rests upon no better safeguard
than liberal salaries will inevitably give wav at
the first convenient opportunity.
An argument often presented in favor of high
salaries in every department of the national and
State governments is that they are necessary to
secure the services of adequate talent, and par-
ticularly to call out men from lucrative employ-
ments or professions. (Annals Fifteenth Con-
gress, first session, 1817-18, pages 572, 585.)
But experience has demonstrated the reverse
of this. Motives of duty, of patriotism, of
distinction, are higher and holier than mere
pecuniary reward. He who would not serve
his country for these with moderate compensa-
tion, would not honorably or faithfully serve
it when actuated by the more sordid motive of
gain.
Our policy should rather be to make the
general welfare the leading motive for entering
the public service, and then a "reverential
regard" will be inspired for patriotic labors.
I have not introduced these bills regulating
compensation in the form which I believed to
