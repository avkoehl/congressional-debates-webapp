GENERAL ORDERS, WAR DEPT., ADJT. GENERAL'S OFFICE, Numbers 82. Washington, April 1, 1863.

There will be made on the 10th of April, or as soon thereafter as practicable, a general muster of all the troops in the service of the United States, wheresoever they may be. The muster-rolls will be immediately sent to the Adjutant-General of the Army, for the use of the Provost-Marshal-General in making drafts to fill up regiments and batteries to the proper complements.

SIR: If credit is given Illinois for excess furnished under all calls our quote under new calls to be filled by conscription would be comparatively small. There are now no available troops in the State. All those to be relieved from guarding prisoners of war are required by General Burnside in Kentucky, and I insist that there is greater need for a force in the State for purposes contemplated by your order of 9th of February that at any time since commencement of the rebellion. Three regiments, one of cavalry and two of infantry, are now nearly full and ready for organization. I believe the authority of the Government cannot be enforced in arresting deserters and keeping down insurrection without force of this character, and urge you to continue the order at least as to those three regiments now nearly raised.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RICHARD YATES,

Governor.
