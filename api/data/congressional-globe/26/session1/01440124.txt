CONGRESSIONAL GLOBÉ.
Mr CLAY of Kentucky presented the memorial of a commu-
te* of the Amrric n silk Societv, piavmg the aid a id pitrunage
of the Government in the priii mg a d eUoiiibuting the journal
of «id soeiety
Ih presenting th s memorial, Mr Cut said, whi'e I am up I
Will remark 11 it, in my opinion, theie is hardly a pro lucuon in
which this couatiy is eiua9ed which is more important to be
duly attended u at this turn ihan that ot silk    As an agucul
tural product, it 13 appr ípriate to all partsof the rounny  And
among the causes which have occasioned the unexampled state
of distress from which no portion ol this wide country is ex
empt, which has increased, is increasing, and I wish to God 1
could see any hope of its end—at least among the foreign causes
of ihis remarkable stale ol distress, is unquestionably th it of
purchasing so much abioad  Sir, we must make more at home,
and bring less from abroad, ifwe would remove the causes of
distress, and this remark is applicable to our own productions
m every form, of agriculture as well as of fabrication    And
in regard to silk itself look at the facts    For se\ en years past,
the annual amou it ol it brought into this country ha« been
¿12510000 and one yearn rose to $¿0 000000, and this $13,
600 000 n lor anímele winch, n any tlu is, is for the adoin
ment and luxury of man    ¡silk is that amele
Sir, no country ca i long withstand for which the annual im
ports exceed the exports by home $40 000 000 or $30 000000
And if l was n it absolutely pow iless, tt my fnen'a an I my-
self had any piwer in the direction ol tins Government I would
to morrow impose a duty equal to the maximum which the
compromise act a Inu s, that i , 20 per cent   o i tins import of
413,500008 m silk     I would lay this duty on silk, and with a
view, in part, to pievent a dangerous exce s ef reten le, I
would ihstiibute the annual proe eds of the sales of the public
lands to the stales as their own property, to whuhthry aieal
ready entitle' anJIetths fun 1 assist them to liquidate their
debes, and to foster those gre it in erests whic i aie justly dear
to them, so far as there is now freedom from debt    1 would im-
pose this diuy on si k and on other luxuries, and if the la ids
are not necessarv to the ¡>u inort of this Givernment, 1 would
distnbu e the proteeds of the land* among the States who are
entitl d to them      Bat   e, or at least I am not in the con ¡ilion
to do what! h ive suggested, and theieiore I c nnot di other

Mr CA1HOUN sud I rise to make no oppoiton to the

whichare now of thief impoitince, and I hop that no'rrilich
more ofihts season will pass b fore we sh ill 20 deeply into that
subiect The c mruy is 11 iw a* apomt at which it has beeome
of far in ire interest 1 ían ever
Sir, I diiler "i to 0 irom the Sena or fiom K"n ucky as to tho
causes ol ds-res?, and,it I am not mistaken, thej die the very
opp isileol w lat have b-en a si  led    To revive the old, the
tried, and e«n le rmed Amenta t system, would be rum mis in

He looked upm my measure that would, at tl .stiiie, increase
the credit of the mates so as to entitle them to sell moie bonds
in foreign markets, a.- positively 11 jurious    We ship our cr*
dit, and buna in goods    I ho'd the very reverse of whv the
Senator has indicated as the true policy, and I hop" for an e trly
opportunity of pointing out that policy, and that at an earl j day
we shall look deep in o the subject
Mr CLAY This is a Intle unusual, to engige in a discus
«ion on this subjec thus before the lime Sir, hive I proposed
or suggested a revival of the tariflflurther than the compromise
allow ! Not in (he slightest degree I merely proposed a duty
on silk, as an article of 1 ixury, entirely consistent with the
compromise Sir, whit was it that I proposed? It was simply
that the maximum duiy of the c impromise—that is, twenty
per cent —ehouid he impose 1 on siU, which is in no way in-
compauhle with the c >in ir nm-e
And how CAa linn ii iuie I e roim-fictiires of cotton s'10
budding, or any th ug el-i, w ueh die now neaily prostrated)
The woollen manufactuter at the North is almost entirely
stopped, md that of iron itstll i- i nong the most languishing
How can the duty on this luxury affect either the manufarturt-s
or agriculture of the coun ryf It wi 1 benefit them, for it will
directly aid the ma lufarture of silk, ai d, if raw silk is pro
duued withsucccss it becomesa fit object lor nnpoiti ion, and
it may aid greatly in removing ihat 1 uinous excess in the lia
lance of trade, wmch will crush us ail, unless the people can
rise to tneir c wn rein f
And the íme i'el) ■=! Sir, I fhoul 1 like tokio  by what
right the subject ol Sate debts is e > frequently diaaged into
this Senate and the ¡s ates arc heie eluded and censtnt d as If
UDiler our supeni ion Who gives us jurisdiction ovtr
them? Uy what authoniy nive v\c thengnt to say to Penn
sylvama, 01II loon, 01 a iy ot íer •> 1 o, you are extrivigint,
you have got into d bt, and we wn 1 iv . joj to get out
as you can. Wnence is his iigh 1 Who made it the du >
of the Federal Government to sive lectures to th 8jx es
on getting into this deb i But ise debls have been con
tracted, an I, as the ¡seniior loin South Carolina says one
ebect of lthas own to en irge our 1 nports, b"cau>e the means
arising frim the Sidte b > 1 Is has bee 1 thro \n into the channel
of commerce But it will be m longer so (>r that v rv
means will now become an ohstruc 1111 to commeice But
those debts exi-t, and as men of honot and hone=iy, those who
owe them must pav tln.m, and I trust no man here will be so dts
titute ol honor  n 1 prob ty a5 to sav thty ought not to be paid
They hive been contricied, aid our State' have received the
benefit, and I ros an 1 beiievt- that not 1 va e of this Uni n
will be so lost 10 honor ami grod id) h as not to pa> such
debts Tie debs, exist,and in the wirs,. form , because the
foreigner is against i.s no as a whole, but as divided into parts,
as separate members of the C utfe leracj on whom there is fo
reign debt, and ion-arpien lyfjreign influence
And what is to be dinet The Sides have here proposed
nothing, .n either branch of Congress But we know the exist
enee ot these deb s, and the t'sresswlmh prevails in these
different comuiumu s and we know that taxinon will be
necessary Some of the Staler, right or wiong, have con
11 acted debts toan ex ent which the pcop e cannot hear,
and if we are not destitute of all those, feelings whichought to
belong to a pareit Givernment, and when, as surn, we
should cherish, we ought deerly to sympa'h ze wuh all the *
sufferings
Well, and what suggestion did I make? Was it to assume
these debts] No, sir, no, sir But we are in possession of an
Important fund, which, of right, lielongs tp the State)     The
I States have no power of lrrpoing duties on imports for tho
purpose of relieving themselves And what was my sugges
I ttoni Tie d-bts exist, in tnu t be pud, puno, al and 1 'en t,
and my sugestión w is, that we should „ivc up wh t bclot gs
to the stats or a least d what we can lor tlum, by trip s
nig du íes 0 1 irtii les purely ol luvuiy, a id give the Statesthe r
own (iropeity the pioceeds of the public Ian I , which   ml 1 ol
itself be suftu lent to pay the interest on a debt ol $ 100,100,0 0,
and 1 believe the whole am unt of the fe a e debts is nut m ich
more than S100 000 000 But I have beendiawn into an exhi
bition ol these views on an occisión wh n I had nol in ended it
I merely meant to 11 ake some suggestions appropriate on pre
' sentmsa uiemotial TneSenator 11 m South Carolina thought
fit to express, what is not at all extraordinary, that there is a
1 total difference of opinion between us on this subject But he
misstated me in regard to the tai id", and I therefore thought tt
my duty to say w hat I have d me on that point, and I trust this
willseive with the   enate as my apology
Mr CALHOl \ I will not enter into the argument, but
mereiy say, by way of comment on 'he Senatoi's remarks, that
his scheme in regard to the public lands, is oneaof the mod fit a
tions foi assuming the State deb s, and, in mj opinion, It is the
most unconstitutional and ruinous that can be una ! i-d Bt t
1 trust the Senaior from l'enne-^ee [Mr Grindy] will give us
