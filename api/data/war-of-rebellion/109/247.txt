Major-General POPE,

Commanding Army of the Mississippi, in the Field:

GENERAL: Prisoners had better be sent to the rear, say Hamburg or vicinity, to be guarded. It is impossible to entirely supply Buell from Pittsburg. A double road, if necessary, must be made to Hamburg. The Right Wing rests on Mud Creek. Don't advance your main body at present; we must wait till Buell gets up.*
