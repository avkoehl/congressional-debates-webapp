ated to carry into effect the provisions of this act.
Mr. A. now moved that the bill be referred to the
Committee on Territories.
Mr. ARCHER moved its reference to the Com-
mittee on Foreign Relations. It was only necessary
to call the attention of the Senate to the fact that this
very question would be before the Committee on
Foreign Relations before the termination of the pres-
ent session, in consequence of the correspondence
between the British government and our government
on the subject. It seemed very strange to him that
one committee should be charged with the consider-
ation of that correspondence, the object of which
was, avowedly, by both parties, to lead to an arnica*
ble adjustment of all difficulties connected with the
questions at issue; and that another committee
snould be charged with a measure, the tendency of
which was to frustrate that amicable adjustment.
He hoped the Senate would not hesitate to give its
decision in favor of the reference he had called for.
Mr. ATCHISON observed that there was nothing
of a foreign nature in the bill; it simply proposed the
organization of a government for the Territory of
Oregon, and to donate land. It seemed to him that
there could be no reasonable objection to referring
the bill to the Committee on Territories. If there
was no such committee, the Committee on the Ju-
diciary would be the appropriate committee. There
was nothing touching upon foreign affairs at all in it;
nothing in the bill to be referred to a Committee on
Foreign Relations. If the senator from Virginia
could point out any thing in the bill rendering it
proper to refer its consideration to that committee,
he (Mr. A.) should have no objection to its taking
that coursc, cxcept oneâbut that objection was a
very strong, and, according to parliamentary usage
an insuperable objectionânamely, thatnotamember
of that committee, except one, was favorable to its
object. It was well known that the Committee on
Foreign Relations was opposed to the measure.
Now, according to parliamentary usage, and the
uniform practice of the Senate, he believed that rea-
son alone, if none other existed, would be sufficient
to withhold its reference from that committee.
Mr. ARCHER would inquire of the honorable
senator from Missouri, what it was that the two
governments had to negotiate about, if it was not the
question of territorial jurisdiction? Now he (Mr.
A.) put it to the honorable senator tÂ® say whether
any bill can pass, involving that question of jurisdic-
tion, that will not come in conflict with the arrange-
ments beiHg made by negotiation relative to that very
jurisdiction. Let him suggest to the honorable sen-
ator a single consideration. Suppose that a treaty on
the subject should be sent here some little time
hence, prescribing one form of jurisdiction, and the
bill passed through Congress had prescribed another,
quite different: would the honorable senator tell him
how he would be able to justify the conflict between
the legislative and executive departments' of this
government which might be produced? He (Mr.
A.) had no d<?ubt that if there was no interference
