Major-General HURLBUT,

Commanding Department:

GENERAL: I have this day received the following information from Mobile relative to movements of the enemy, from party who has given information before which proved reliable: Lieutenant General Dick Taylor is in command of Department of East Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. There are about 40,000 men in his command. General Forrest commands all the cavalry. Has closed the line and issued orders to shoot any person attempting to pass without order to pass from himself. General S. D. Lee is at Tupelo with one army corps. Two army corps have been sent to Selma (Hardee's old corps, Hindman supposed to be in command, and Stewart's corps). General Frank Gardner has been relieved and is to tried by court-martial of drunkenness. General Martin commands his department. General Maury is in command of Mobile. The city is to be defended to last extremity, but if compelled to fall back, stores and all cotton to be burned. General A. P. Hill has been sent from Virginia with his corps to stop General Sherman, who they think is going to Wilmington. A force about 5,000 men are at Pollard (some fifteen miles from Pensacola). General Dick Taylor
