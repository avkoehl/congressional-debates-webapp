Macon, Ga., April 24, 1865.

The attention of division commanders is called to the communication from Colonel J. G. Vail, Seventeenth Indiana (mounted) Infantry, commanding post at Macon, Ga.:

MAJOR: I would respectfully call your attention to the fact that a great number of depredations are being committed by parties of brigands, dressed in our own and Confederate uniforms, on all the roads leading into the country. Houses are burned and the country desolated as far out as fifteen miles. The citizens are calling on me for protection, and I do not understand that my jurisdiction extends outside of the city, and at any rate have not a sufficient force at my disposal to afford protection to persons in the country. There seem to be no pickets on the roads, and negroes are coming into the city from every direction and will soon become a burden and endanger the city. I would respectfully ask that some measures be taken to prevent them from coming here.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. VAIL,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

Picket-posts, outposts, and vedettes must at once be properly posted to prevent the influx of negroes and depredations by our own troops within and beyond the lines. Patrols will be sent in every direction under the command of division and brigade provost-marshals to arrest all men engaged in marauding and out of camp without proper passes.

By command of Brevet Major-General Wilson:
