HEADQUARTERS,

Deep Bottom, July 16, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel E. W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Tenth Army Corps:

The enemy opened early this morning from a battery of four guns (three rifled and one smooth-bore) on the gun-boat Mendota at the pontoon bridge. The gun-boat was struck several times and I think had some casualties. The bridge is unhurt, but escaped narrowly. My headquarters were shelled without any loss, however, except a horse belonging to one of the staff. The battery is situated on Strawberry Plains, just in the edge of the woods, and completely enfilades the river at this point. They have ceased firing, but I think are still in position. The gun-boat has dropped down the river.

Respectfully, yours,

R. S. FOSTER,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

General WEITZEL:

The above just received.

W. T. H. BROOKS.
