HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General CORSE, Rome, Ga.:

The 10th is as early as I expect to commence the movement. The Army of the Tennessee is being paid off. Send with your foraging party to Texas Valley to-morrow at least a brigade, and let them feel out to the gap. Stay there to-morrow night and come in next morning. I want it to produce a certain effect. Ask Colonel Spencer if he could get about a dozen bold men, soldiers or citizens, either for pay or for adventure, to start south from Rome and break up the telegraph wire between Montgomery and Columbus, and then overtake us somewhere about Macon.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General CORSE, Rome, Ga.:

You will find forage plenty in Texas Valley, and will have time to get it. We hear of no battle as yet in Tennessee. Hood does not attack, but is fortifying at Florence and working over to Corinth.

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Kingston, Ga., November 7, 1864.

Brigadier-General CORSE, Rome, Ga.:

I telegraphed you this morning, and again the general this afternoon, about your forage matter, and you must have received both, and will therefore be fully advised. I judge you will have cars to get off your Government property, but won't answer for cotton. No news.

L. M. DAYTON,

Aide-de-Camp.
