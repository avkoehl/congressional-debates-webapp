sadors and other public Ministers whose right to
exemption from arrest is personal, requiring no fact
to be ascertained but the mere fact oí diplomatic
character, and to arrest whom is sometimes made
a highly penal office, if the arrest be actually made,
it must be discharged by application to the courts
of law.
It is understood that Alexander McLeod is holden
as well on civil as on criminal process for acts al-
leged to have been done by him in the attack on the
"Caroline," and his defence or ground of acquittal
must be the same m both cases And this strongly
illustrates, as the undersigned conceives , th  pro-
priety of the foregoing observations, since n is
quite clear that the Execu ive Government cannot
interfere to arrest a civil suit between private par-
lies in any stage of its progress, but lhat such suit
must go on to its regular j adicial termmatio-i If,
therefore, any course different from su"h as have
been now mentioned «asm contemplation of her
Majesty's Governm n , sometning wou! I stem to
have been expected froJi the Govern  t of ne
United States as hule con orm* Die to th laws and
usages of the Euglish Government a' io those of
the United States ana to which this Government
cannot accede
The Government of the United States, therefore,
acting upon the presumption which is already
adopted, that nothing extraordinary or unusual was
expected or requested of it, dec ded, on the recep-
tion of Mr Fox's note, to take such measures as
the occasion and its own duty app ared to require.
In his note to Mr Fox of the 26th of December
last, Mr Forsyth, the Secretary of State cf die
United States, observes, that' if the des tuction of
the'Caroline'was a public act ot persons n her
Majesty'  service, ob-yitig the order of their supe-
rior authorities, ihis fact ha  not been before
communicated to the Government of the United
Sutes by a person authorized to make the admis-
sion, and it will be for the court which has taken
cognizance of the offence with wmch Mr McLeod
is charged, to decide upon its val dity wh°n legally
established before it," and adds, "The Piesidem
deems this to be a proper occasion to remnd the
Government of her Bntann c Majesty that the
case of the 'Caroline' has been long since brought
to the attention of her 'vlajesty's principal Secreta-
ry of State for Foreign Affairs, who, up to this
day, has not communicated its decision thereupon
It is hoped that the Government of her Majesty
will perceive the importance ot no longer leaving
the Government of the United States umformed of
its views and intentions upon a subject which his
naturally produced much exaspetation, and which
has led to such grave consequences "
The communication of the fact that the destruc-
tion of the "Can line" «as an act of public force
by the British au honttes being formal y commun -
cated to the Government of the United States by
Mr. Fox's note, th° case assumes a decided asppct
The Government of the United Sta es enter a n 
no doubt that, after tais avowal of the transaction
as a public transaction, authorized and undertaken
by the British authorities, individuals concerned in
it ought not, by the principles' of public law and
the general usage of civilized States, to be hoiden
personally responsible m the ordinary tribunals oc
law for their participation in it. 4ni th" Pen-
dent presumes that it can hardly be necessary to
say that the American people, not distrustful of
their ability to redress public wrcajrs by public
means, cannot desire the punishment of indivi-
duals when the act complained ^f is declared to
have been an act of the Government itself
Soon after the date of Mr Fox's note, an in-
struction was given to the Attorney General of the
United Stales from this Department, by direction
of the President, which fully sets forth the opinions
of this Government on the subject Gf Mr Mc-
Lecd's impris mment, a copy of which instruction
the undersigned has the honor herewith to enclose
The mdic ment agains' McLeod is pending in a
State court, but his rights, whatever they may be,
are no less «afe, it is tobe presumed, than if he
were holden to answer in one of the court  of tfajb
Government
He demands immunity from personal  responsi-
bility by virtue of the law of nations, and that law,
Repot t from the Department of State.

None is either so lugi or so low as to escipe fiom

ples apply
This Department has bpen regulaily informed,
by his Excellency the Go ernor of the State ot
New York, that ihe Chief Just ce of that State was
assigned to preside at the hearing and trial of Mc-
Leod' cafe, but lhat, owing to some error or mis-
take i th" process oí summoning 'he jury, the
hearing «j. necessarily deferred
The President re rets t ,is occurrence, as he hns
a desire for i speedy disposition of the sUDject
The cojnsel for McLeod have requested authentic
evidence of the avowal by the Bnli h Government
of the attacic on, and destructi n of, the "Caro-
line," as ac s done under its auhonty, and «uch
evidence will be iuriished. to 'nem by this I>epait-
raent'
It is understood that the indictment has been re-
moved into th" Sup'eme Court of the Sta e bv the
proper proceeding for that purpose, snd that it is
n*w competent lor McLeod, by the ordinary pro-
cess ol habeas corpus, to bring his case ior heating
before that tribanat
Trie unders gned hardly needs to assure Mr
Fix that a tribunal so eminently distinguished tor
ability and leirmng as the Supreme Court of the
State of New York, rmy be safely relied upon f-r
the ju«t and impartial admmis rati >n of the law in
this as well as m otner cases, and the undersigned
repeats ihs expression of the desne of this Govern
ment than no delay may be suffered to take place
la these proceedings which can be avoided Of this
desire, Mr Fi x will see evidence in the instructions
above referred to
The undersigned has now to signify to Mr Fox
that the Government of the Unit d Statos has rot
changed ihe opmi >n wn ch it has heretofo e ex-
pressed to htrMaje ty's Government of the charac-
ter ot the act ot destroying the "Caroline "
It does not thintt that the tiansaction can be jus
tifie 1 by any rea^c nable application or constiuc-
t« n ot the right of self defence, under the laws of
na ions It is admitted that a just right of self de-
fence a teches always <o na >ns as v e 1 as to indi-
viduals, and is equ^'lj neceser} for the preserva-
ron oí both But the extent of this right is a qjes-
tion o be judged of by the circumstances < f each
P'rticular case, and when its alleged exercise has
kd to the commission of hostile acts within the ter-
ritory of a power at peace, nothing less than a e'ear
and absolute ncessitj can afford ground of justifi
cation Not having, up io this time, been made ac
quamted with the views and reasons, at length,
which have led her Majesty's Government to think
the de truetion of the " Caroline " just Sableas an
act of self-defence, the undersigned, earnestly re-
newing the remonstrance of this Government
against the transaction, abstains for the pre ent,
from any extendtd discussion of the question But
it is deemed proper, nevertheless, not to omit to
take some notice of the general grounds of justifica
Hon stated by her Majesty'* Government m their
instruction to Mr Fox
Her Majesty's Government have instructed Mr
Fox to say that they are of opinion that the trans-
acnon vhich teimmated m the destruction of the
Caroline was ajustifiable employment of force, for
the purpose of defenJmg the British territory from
the unprovoked attack of a band of British rebels
and American pirates, who, having been " permi'-
tt.d " to aim and otgamze themselves w.thm the
territory of the United S a es,had actually invaded
a r>ouion of the te ntory of her Majesty
The President cannot suppose that her Majesty's
Government, by the use ot these terms, me^nt to be
understood as inti nating that those acts, violating
the laws of the United States, and disturbing the
peace of the British territories, weredone under any
degree of countenance from this Government, or
were regard d by it with irdiff->rence, oi lha , t.n
der he c rcums anees d he case, they eoald have
been prevented by the ordinary course of proceed
irg Although he regrets that, by using the term
" permil'ed,' a possible inference of that kind
might be iaised, yet such an inference, the Presi-
dent is willing to believe, would be quite unjust to j
the intentions of the British Government
Senate and H. of Reps.
That on a line of frontier such as separates the
Uniied States from her Britannic Majesty'  North
American Provinces—a line long enough to divide
the whole of Europe into halves- irregnlarities,
violences, and conflicts should sometimes occur,
equally against the will of both Governments, is
certainly easily to be supposed. This may be more
possible, perhaps, m regard to the United States,
without any reproach to their Government, since
their institution^ entirely discourage the keeping up
of large standing armies m time oí peace, and their
situation happily exempts them fiom the necessity
of maintaining such expensive and dangerous esta-
blishments All that can be expected from either
Government in these cases is good fatth, a sincere
desire to preserve paace and do justice, the use of
all proper means of prevention, and that if offences
cannot, neverth°le*s, be always prevented, the of-
fenders shall sun be justly punished In all ihese
respects, this Government acknowledges ao delin-
quency in the performance of its duties.
Her Majest)'s Government are pleased, also, to
speak of tnose American citizens who took part
with persons m Canada, engaged in an insurrection
. against the British Government, as "American pi-
rates " The undersigned does not admit the pro
pnety or justice of this designation If citizens of
the United States fitted out, or were engaged in fit-
ting out, a military expedition from the United
States intended to act against the British Govern-
ment in Canada, they were clearly violating the
laws of their countiy, and exposing themselves to
t^e just consequences which might be inflicted on
the i if taken withm the Batish dom nions But,
no withstanding ihis, they were certainly not pr-
ratt-<-, nor does the undtr igned tmnk that it can ad-
vance the purpose of fair and friendly discussion,
or hasttn the jctofimodation of national difficul
ties, so to de it mínate ihen Tneir offence, what-
ever it was, had no analogy to casps of piracy
Supposing all that is alleged against them to be
true, Ihey were taltirg a part in what they regarded
as a civil war, and they *ere taking a part on the
side of the rebels Surely England herself has not
regarde! per oris thus engaged as deserving the ap-
pellation wn ch her Majesty's Government be-
stows on these cmz ns of ¡he United S a es
It is quae notorious that, for ihe greatest part of
Hie last two centuries, "uljects of the Brm h crown
have .been permitttd to engage in foreign wars,
both nations! and civil, and in th latter in every
stage of their progre , and yet it has not been ima-
giKtd that EngUid has at anj time allowed her
subjects to mm pirates Indeed, in our own times,
not only havt individual subj°cts of that crown
gone abroad to engage m civil wars, but we have
seen whole regiments openly recruited, embodied,
armed, and disciplined in England, with the avow-
ed purpose of aiding a rebellion against a nation
with whtc i England was at peace, although it is
true that subsequently, an act of Par lament was
passed to prevent transactions so nearly approach-
ing to public war, without license from the crown
It may be said that there is a difference between
the case ot a civil war, a*iswg from a disputed suc-
cession, or a protracted revolt of a colony against
the mother country, and the case of a fresh out-
break, at the commencement of a rebellion. The
undersigned does not deny that such distinction may,
for certain purposes, b  t eemed well founded He
admits that a Government, called upon to consider
iso i r ghts, interests, ?nd duties, when civil
wars break out in other countries, may decide on
all the circumstances of the particular case, upon
it  own existing stipulations, on probable results,
on what its own security requires, and on many
other considerations It may be already bound to
assist one party, or it may become bound, if it so
chooses, to assist the other, and to meet the conse-
quences ot such assistance.
But whether the revolt be recent or long conn-
nuei, they who join those concerned m it, what-
ever may be their offence asainst their own conn-
try, or h «ever ihey bo treated, if tak^n with arms
in their hands, in ihe territory of the Government
against which the standard ot revolt is raised, can-
not he denominated pirates, without departing from
all ordinary use of language in the definition of
offences    A cause which has so foul an origin as
