Then I was ordered again to go down to assist Captain Jones' company. I went where Captain Jones' company was in the ravine. While I was down there assisting Captain Jones [the] sun set, and [an] order was given to fall back to the regiment. My men and everybody else heard an order and left the place; but Lieutenant Riley and I, not hearing an order, remained until Lieutenant Riley told me we were left alone and was to be surrounded by the enemy. We were the very last men [to come] out [of] the ravine.

Lieutenant James Riley was [the] only lieutenant that [came] along with me, and in fighting he encouraged our men along and he stood and fought manfully with them through [the] whole fight.

I venture to say that all my men have bravely fought through during [the] whole battle; also I am confident the battle lasted fully four hours from the commencement to the end.*

It was late in the evening when we left the battle-field.

Colonel COOPER,

No. 9. Report of Captain William B. Pitchlynn, First Choctaw and Chickasaw Regiment, of engagement at Chust-Talasah.

FORT DERDANE, Cherokee Nation, January 18, 1862.

SIR: I have the honor to submit a brief report of the engagement in which the company [of which] I am honored to be captain fought so successfully on Bird Creek, Cherokee Nation, December 9, 1861:

When orders were given to make a charge our point of attack was made a distance near half a mile above the old captain, at the mouth of a certain ravine, and there we remained and fought desperately nearly an hour, when the firing of the enemy partially ceased. At this time we had orders to move and attack in the direction of the old cabin, where we remained the balance of the day.

The mode of warfare adopted by the enemy compelled us,as you are aware, to abandon strict military discipline and make use of somewhat similar movements in order to be successful.

At the close of the battle we took our proper place in the regiment, according to orders, and found one of my company fatally wounded, who expired on the second night after the battle. Two horses and equipments were lost in the engagement.

I will merely state that my men fought bravely and gallantly.

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

WM. B. PITCHELYNN,

Captain Co. A. Choctaw and Chickasaw Regiment Mounted Rifles.

Colonel D. H. COOPER, Commanding.
