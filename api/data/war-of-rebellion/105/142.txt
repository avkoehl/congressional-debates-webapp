Tuscon is about halfway between Fort Yuma and the Rio Grande, and contains a population of 400, or perhaps 500, mostly Mexicans. A few Americans and foreigners were living here, principally gamblers and ruffians, traitors to their country - secessionists.

On his arrival at Tuscon the Territory of Arizona was at once placed under martial law, and the following proclamation issued. *

A number of notorious characters were arrested, examined by military commissions, and sent to Fort Yuma. Order sprang from disorder, and in a short time a den of thieves was converted into a peaceful village. In the meantime General Carleton was making active preparations to move his command to the Rio Grande; wagons were repaired, stores collected from Sonora, and everything put in as good condition as circumstances would permit after the severe march over the Yuma and Gila Deserts. No communication up to this time could be had with our forces in New Mexico. The strength of the rebels and their locality entirely unknown. The great difficulty in communicating with General Canby, at that time in cimmand of the Department of New Mexico, was on account of the hostile Indians, the Apache Nation occupying the whole country between the Rio Grande and the Colorado Rivers. The great distance to be traversed through their country rendered it hazaradous, if not impossible, for any small party to get through it. General Carleton endeavored to send an express to General canby from Tucson. This was carried by three men. The party was attacked
