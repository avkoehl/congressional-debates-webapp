to return to Pulaski, and then make the march to the Tennessee River, provided always that arrangements have been made to have subsistence meet us upon our arrival. My instructions from General Thomas, received to-day are similar to those sent to you. One of his directions is to send back all of the artillery to Pulaski, where it can get forage: but as this direction was given upon the supposition that it would reach me at Pinhook Town, and supposing that a day's march nearer the river might make a change in General Thomas' view in regard to the disposition of the artillery, I have written to him that I will not start it back before to-morrow. I expect in the meantime to receive other instructions from him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
