THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 17,
one half of the same having been built in Maine.
These vessels had a tonnage of 79,434.73. Dur-
ing the same time the cotton States built 31 ves-
sels, carrying a tonnage of only 3,079.25. In 1860,
89 ships and barks were built in the United
States. Of this number 78 were buiit in New
England. The great mass of the shipping for the
whole Union has been built, for years, by New
England mechanics.
In works of internal improvement New Eng-
land comparatively is ahead of any other section
of the Union, and far in advance of the cotton
States. In 1854, New England had built and in
operation 3,353 miles of railroads, and 165 miles
of canals. In these works she had invested
$121,425,422, being more than one fourth of all
the capital invested in railroads and canals in the
United States. The six cotton States had, at the
same time, 2,006 miles of railroads, and 230
miles of canals, and had invested in these works
$35,459,283; only about one sixth of the amount
invested by New England. The whole capital
invested in railroads and canals in the United
Statesin 1854,was$489,603,028. In 1852the8tates
of this Union owed in the aggregate the sum total
of $191,508,922. Of this amount the New Eng-
land States owed only $6,854,905; being only
about one thirtieth part of the whole debt. The
six cotton States owed, in 1852, $23,697,592; more
than four times the amount of indebtedness on
the part of the New England States.
The currency of New Englandls the soundest
in the Union. In 1850 she had 500 banks, having
a capital invested of $119,590,423. They had m
circulation, in loans and discounts, $179,992,420.
The six cotton States had at the same time but 62
banks, with n capital of $56,357,341; and a circu-
lation, in loans and discounts, of$81,248,983. The
banks in New England are, as a whole, the most
reliable of any in*fhe country. Their notes pass
at less discount, by way of exchange, than those
of any other hanking institutions in the country.
If it is said, New England does not bear her
full proportions of the public burdens in the Con-
federacy, let me give you a mathematical demon-
stration which blows away all such charges like
chaff before the wind. I cite it to show how
other portions of the Union suffer pecuniarily in
consequence of their Federal relations with Now
England. The Postmaster General, in his an-
nual report made to the last session of the present
Congress, gave us a schedule of the receipts and
expenditures of each State in that Department for
the year ending June 30, 1859. From this it ap-
pears that there was an excess of expenditures,
over the receipts, of $6,376,733 04; but when you
take the schedule for New England, you "will find
not one dollar of this excess can be charged to
her. On the other hand, New England paid all
her own bills, and had an excess of receipts over
her expenditures of $67,556 07; which sum went
into the common fund to relieve tlje States having
a deficit.
How was it with the six cotton States. Their
receipts were $772,987 24, their expenditures
$2,289,583 17; leaving the General Government to
pay for them the nice little sum of $1,566,595 83
annually. The Federal Government pays them
thrvt dollai s, where it receives one back. No won-
der the " Kingdom " of South Carolina graciously
allows the United States to keep up its postal
arrangement within the ''realm" after it has,
through fire and sword, marched out of this ''ac-
cursed Union." And I suppose the other seced-
ing States will allow " Uncle Sam" to do what
they cannot do themselves—carry their mails at
an enormous expense, even if it be in foreign Gov-
ernments. Massachusetts, the most wealthy New
England State, pays all her bills for carrying the
mail and for post office accommodations, with an
excess of $157,622 51; while Georgia, the most
wealthy of the six cotton States, pays into the
Treasury $168,664 73,and draws out $35^,180 03.
The following table, prepared from the Postmas-
ter General's repoit, proves the facts above stated:

Mr. Chairman, I do not make these compari-
sons for the purpose of assailing any of the States
of this Union, but I do it to vindicate New Eng-
land from the eternal clamor that has been raised
against her by her sister States in the South.
I ask our brethren of the South, and of the
middle States, of the Pacific coast and of the great
Northwest, to lay aside your prejudices; and as
the great Webster once said of Massachusetts, I
now say of New England: "there she stands,
look at her." Look at her ships riding upon every
ocean, and her commerce whitening eveiy sea;
look upon her beautiful harbois, her broad, ex-
pansive bays, her glassy lakes, her flowing rivers,
and gurgling water-falls; look at her fertile val-
leys, her gentle slopes, and cloud-capped mount-
ains; look at her magnificent cities, teeming with
life, activity, commerce, and trade; at her beauti-
ful villages, where the charming notes of industry
greet each coming morn and salute the parting
day; look at her thousand farm-houses and white
cottages dotting her landscapes; her bleating flocks
and lowing herds roaming upon a thousand hills;
look at her lofty spires, from whose sounding
domes the church-going bell greets each returning
Sabbath morn; at her halls of science and erudi-
tion; at her school-houses, where Presidents and
Senatois and warriors are made; look at her gi-
gantic mills, whose busy hum forever chants the
dignity of labor and cheers on the hand of indus-
try to a rich reward; look at her asylums, her
hospitals, her splendid humane institutions, where
the blind are restored to sight, the lame taught,to
leap and the dumb to sing. Ay, sir, give one long,
earnest look at that goodly heritage left us by our
fathers, and then tell me if, in the honesty and
sincerity of your hearts, you cannot exclaim:
brave land of the Pilgrims, " with all thy faults
wc love thee still!"
Our southern brethren may have forgotten the
glorious past; but New England's sons still lin-
ger in their thoughts around the council-fires of
the Revolution. You sent us a Washington, to
lead our armies against a hireling, mercenary foe;
wc sent you a Greene, to defend your homes and
firesides against invaders from abroad and tories
at home. Your fathers and our fathers, side by
side, amid the winds and frosts and snows of win-
ter,the sultryheatand scorchingsunsof summer,
fought and toiled and suffered seven long years
to purchase the blessing we are now enjoying.
To-day they are sleeping " that sleep which knows
no waking" in a common grave. Notwithstand-
ing wc have a common history, a common in-
heritance, our brethren of the South, in a hostile
manner, threaten to cut asunder all Federal rela-
tions with their brethren of the free States, and
especially of New England.
New England has an interest in the preser-
vation of this Union beyond a mere love of a
common country. Her hardy sons are found in
every State and Territory. They have gone out
from the old northeastern hive to build -up the
commerce of your cities; to navigate your livers,
lakes, and seas; to clear your forests, and people
your prairies. They have earned along with
them the enterprise, the genius, the moral training,
the love of learning, and good order, which have
always characterized the home of their fathers.
In the East and the West, in the North and the
South, upon every advancing wave in the flood-
tide of civilization, you will find the brave sons
of New England struggling onward ! onward !
amid the ragmgs of the elements, and the bowl-
ings of the storm. Who first penetrates your
forests, and who first pitches his tent upon the
rolling prairies of the Great West ? None but the
hardy pioneer frdhi New England.
And here let me remark, when New England
sends out her sons to her sister States, she often
parts with her brightest jewels. You take New
England boys for your Governors, your judges,
your Senators, and your Representatives; you
honor them, and they honor you. The first Rep-
resentative from Texas upon this floor was a son
aftd emigrant from Maine. The first Delegate and
first Representative to Congress from Oregon were
sons of Maine; both natives of my own county.
Maine gave to Mississippi the brightest intellectual
gem of which she ever could boast—I mean the
distinguished, the eloquent, the brave, and gen-
erous Sargeant S. Prentiss. And here upon this
floor, and in the other end of the Capitol, wc find
sons of New England representing almost every
State in the Union. Among their number upon
this floor, they come from New York, from Penn-
sylvania, from Ohio, from Tennessee, from Illi-
nois, from Missouri, from Michigan, and from
Wisconsin.
Among the distinguished statesmen who, in
times past, have shed such a halo of glory upon
the country and the world, New England has fur-
nished her full share. If the South boasts of her
Calhoun, and the West of her Clay, cannotNew
England, with equal pride, point to her Webster?
And now we arc told by our southern brethren
that all these fraternal relations, which have so
long been fostered,cherished,and loved, must be
broken off; that the old flag, which has for more
than eighty years been floating upon the land and
the waters; which has been the pride and protec-
tion of the citizens of this Republic, at home and
abroad, must bo pulled down and trampled in the
dust, and the palmetto, with a wriggling, crawl-
ing snake, substituted in its stead.
Mr. Chairman, this leads me to a few reflections
upon th  fearful crisis which now seems to be
upon us. Ninety days ago, this nation was m the
very flood tide of prosperity. Never before were
the people of the United States in a condition to he
happier or better contented. This bright picture
is now vailed in gloom. In the North, business
is deranged, labor is depressed; while an uncer-
tainty as to the future paralyzes its industrial
pursuits. Tn the South, the peaceful avocations
of life arc laid aside; quiet no longer reigns around
the fireside; bright hopes and glowing aspirations
have given way to fearful forebodings and sullen
gloom. Commerce has been driven from her cities;
her marts of trade gradually disappear befoic the
measured tread of martial array. Civil war lifts
lus ghastly head and rattling bones, while the
very heavens aire black with revolution and do-
mestic strife.
What is all this for? But one answer can be
given. It is because the people of the United
States have,under the forms.of law, and in strict
conformity with the provisions of the Constitu-
tion,elected a President. It is because Mr. Lin-
coln, and not Mr. Douglas, or Breckinridge, or
Bell, has been elected. "Rule or ruin" is the
only polioy that rules the hour in a portion of the
South. How shall it be met by the friends of the
Union ? The real question at issue is whether wc
have ever had a Government; whether, as a na-
tion, we have even had any of the elements of
self-preservation. If the doctrines we hear from
men of South Carolina politics are true, the whole
country has been under a delusion for seventy
years. If, under the Constitution, a State has a
right to go out of the Union at pleasure, then a
city in a State has a right to secede from a State;
a ward has a right to secede from a city; and any
individual in a ward, if he feels himself oppressed
by the restraints of law, has a constitutional
right to sce<?de and declare himself independent
of all law and all government. The constitutional
argument of secessionists, if they are good for
anything, go to this extent. They contend that
secession is a reserved constitutional right, and
that it is found in articles nine and ten in the
amendments to the Constitution:
" The powers not delegated to the United States by the
Constitution, nor prohibited by it to the States, are reserved
to the States respectively, or to the people.-'
Under this reservation the people, or one man
from among the people, both or either, have just
as clear a right to secede as a State. The doc-
trine of secessionists goes to this extent, that the
people, when they made the Constitution,reserved
the right in the instrument itself, to destroy it at
pleasure. 'This theory is destructive of all gov-
ernments. If we have a Constitution and laws
framed in obedience thereto, neither have any
inherent power or vitality to protect themselves
against a mob, a banditti of lawless men, who
choose to exercise their reserved rights, and set
up rebellion. There is another idea advanced by
secessionists, in connection with the. one already
noticed, which to my mind, is equally illogical
