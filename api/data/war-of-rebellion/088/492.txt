road, and then we shall have to fight in that direction. A comparatively small slashing and breast-work only is required to enable us to close our lines on that side. I wish to put all the axes I have with the men of the reserve force early in the morning to make it. I have already determined it is to be. Captain Cope will report to General Griffin at 4 o'clock in the morning to direct any working party that General Griffin may furnish.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

I sent out the men according to this order. General Potter had already relieved the pickets of Willcox. As my line runs around the palisades it is very long. Shall I relieve the pickets sent out by General Potter?

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
