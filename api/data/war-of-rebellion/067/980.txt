companies in the third line of battle on the left of the division, supporting the Tenth U. S. Infantry. We lay in this position the remainder of the day, not engaged, but losing a few men from the enemy's sharpshooters. At night we were moved back about 50 yards and lay on our arms. On the morning of the 13th we were placed in position on the front line about 400 yards from the enemy by Colonel Humphrey, commanding Second Brigade, Third Division, and the skirmishers under Captain House joined. Here we lay until the morning of the 18th, when we were moved out to support the skirmish line. In so doing the enemy shelled us very severely, but our loss was slight. On the 19th we moved to the corps to the left, and threw up rifle-pits, in which we lay until the commencement of the march to the North Anna, May 21. We lost more or less men every day from the enemy's fire, and I respectfully refer you to the accompanying list of casualties.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. P. AVERY,

Major, Commanding Sixtieth Ohio Volunteer Infantry.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the part taken by this regiment during the march from Spotsylvania to North Anna River, and the action at the latter place:

We marched with the brigade on the 21st [May] and reached the North Anna on the 23d. Bivouacked for the night in range of the enemy's guns, and on the morning of the 24th we were ordered to prepare to cross the line and attack the enemy with the rest of the corps, but after the reconnaissance it was decided not to, and this regiment was moved down to the support of the pickets. We took up a position under cover and remained in it until the movement commenced to the Pamunkey. We lost a few men on picket, but the regiment was not engaged. The men suffered on the march for want of shoes.

For the loss I respectfully refer you to the accompanying report of killed and wounded.+

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
