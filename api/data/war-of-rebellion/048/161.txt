CAMDEN STATION, September 26, 1863-10.10 a.m.

Colonel McCALLUM, Manassas:

In order that we may make proper requisitions on roads west of us, can you not now estimate about the number of stock arms, number of gondolas and flats, and the number of box-cars for baggage that will be needed in addition to the 420 with seats? This is highly important. Our first trains are now more than 100 miles west of Washington.

W. P. SMITH.

CAMDEN STATION, September 26, 1863-10.20 a.m.

Colonel D. C. McCALLUM, Manassas:

It is impossible to avoid more or less confusion in such an extraordinary movement, with your and our want of facilities, as the exact places in the way of tracks, ground platform, and equipments, with proper force of experienced aides. You have done very well indeed, so far,and no less than eight trains have passed up the main road, beyond Relay, before 8 this a.m. We have now put into the avenue 260 cars, with seats, and expect to have 120 more there before night. This is considerably ahead of our understanding, which was to furnish 140 a day, first day, beginning with Thursday evening.

W. P. SMITH.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, Md., September 26, 1863-11 a.m.

(Received 1.20 p.m.)

Hon. E. M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

The first three trains, of over 60 cars, with 2,000 men, passed Martinsburg, 100 miles west of Baltimore,at 8.45 and 9,45 this morning, in good order. The men have been promptly and fully supplied there by the commissary with coffee and other rations. Some twelve trains, with nearly 7,000 men,have now (11 a.m.) passed the Relay House, 30 miles from Washington. The first trains will be due at Benwood, Ohio River, to-morrow (Sunday) before dark, and may get there by noon. Everything so far working well, with complete success. We have telegraphed ahead to Ohio, and the responses indicate the fullest condition of readiness at Bellaire to receive and dispatch. Everything satisfactory.

W. P. SMITH,

Master of Transportation.

A thousand thanks for the diligence and ability manifested in the movement. I cannot tell how much obliged I am to Mr. Garrett and yourself and your subordinates. If there is no hitch in the west all will go well, I hope.
