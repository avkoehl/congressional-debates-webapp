Constitutioa of tbe United States. What was the
process by which a bill became a law? Was it
not absolutely arid imperatively necessary that it
should receive some action from the Executive?
If he approves it, he signs it, and if he does not
approve it, it cannot become a law, even by the
constitutional majority of two-thirds, until the ac-
tion of the Executive has been had on it, by his
returning it to the House from which it originated,
with bis objections.
But there must be a negative or affirmative action
by the President on a bill, or it cannot become a
law. Now, the act thus performed by the Presi-
dent he had been in the habit of calling a legislative
act, but other gentlemen contended that it was an
executive act. It thus appeared that the contro-
versy was not in regard to the nature and effect of
the act, but in regard to the terms in which it should
be designated There was no controversy, in short,
except as to words Mr C. then made copious
quotations from articles written by Mr Madison,
in the Federalist, in support of the position he had
assumed; after which, he replied m refutation of
the arguments of gentlemen who had taken differ-
ent views of the question.
Mr. JOHN CAMPBELL said that, in advoca-
ting the motion to refer the message of the Presi-
dent, or rather the paper from the Department of
State, to the committee of which the gentleman
from Massachusetts (Mr Adams] was chairman,
he was actuated by no feelings of hostility to the
President So far from it, he believed he could
safely say that the country not only owed him a
debt of gra'itude for having twice thrown himselt
into the gulf, Curtms like, and saved the country
from a United States Bank, but also on account of
his having recently refused to sanction a bill
violating a solemn compromise, and by the addi-
tion of a proviso, to which it was known that the
President was opposed However the majority
here might differ as to the course taken by the
President in his public act's, he thought that here-
after, when the excitement of party had pasted
away, all would award to him praise for a
conscientious discharge of his duties and a firm-
ness of purpose
He had mentioned these facts to show that he
was not influe iced in his course by any prejudice
toward the President. He conceived that the ac-
tion of (he President on the apportionment bill wa*
entirely unauthorized by the Constitution, and was
a dangerous (though, bo doubt, an unintentional)
encroachment upon the rights of a large section of
the Union According to the Constitution, "every
bill which shall have passed the House of Repre-
sentatives and the S-nate shall, before it become a
law, be presented to the President of the Um'ed
States, if he approve, he shall sign it, but if not,
he shall return it, with his objections to that Home
in which it shall have originated, who shall enter
tbe objections at large upon their journal, and pro-
ceed to reconsider it " Thus, the negative of the
President was qualified only, and not like that of
the Roman tribune Bat the Constitution «aid "if
he approve, he shall sign it," and here it stops.
There n no language in the Constitution to justify
him in assigning his reasons for such approval, and
notwithstanding the remarks of the gentleman from
Massachusetts, [Mr Cimting ] there was alio
nothing in the <pmt of the Constitution to justify
such a course That gentleman had said that the
President was partly possessed of legislative pow
ers The member, of either House of Congress
might assign tneir reasons for approving a law,
and why should nc t the President be allowed the
same privilege? He (Vr C ) ti d not object ti the
President's a** going his reasons, for approving a
bill What he obi cud to wa , H>a' th- President
-houM hide thrs" reasons m the archives of the
Gove nment The nubl r press of the country
was open to the Present and h-bad been told
that morning that Gen JarUon rame out m th*
Globe, in 1836, when he approvtd the diMnbution
bill of that year
He referred to the argument of the gemleman
from Massachusetts, [Mr Citshing,] that the Pres-
ident possessed judicial p wers in part—as, for in-
stance, in the case of sentent es from courts-mar-
tial.   He admitted this bot the Constitution gave
the President the power, and it could only be exer-
cised in cases where the President thought the sen-
tence of a court marual too severe.
This election law was intended to regulate tbe
ele etions of the members of the House of Represent-
atives. Under the Constitution, each House was
the exclusive judge of the qualifications, elections,
and returns of its members Here, however, was
the interpretation put upon the law by the Presi-
dent, expressing a doubt of its constitutionality, and
thus exercising an indirect influence upon the
States in encouraging them to violate it Possess-
ing this power Irom the formation of tbe Constitu-
tion, so jealous had the House been of allowing
any other branch of the government to participate
in prescribing' the qualifications of its members,
that uo law had been passed even for prescribing
the mode id which contested elections should be
determined. The House had always been fearful
lest the action of one Congress «hould influence a
succeeding one, and therefore no law was ever
passed for accomplishing this object
He rejoiced that this subject had been utrusted
to a committee with such an experienced and well-
qualified chairman as the gentleman from Massa-
chusetts, [Mr Adams ] He hoped that the whole
matter would be inquired into, and that the com-
mittee would say how far our liberties were endan-
gered, and what action it was best to adopt on the
part of the House He had no idea that the Pres-
ident designed any encroachment beyond the pow-
ers conferred on him by the Constitution When
the apportionment bill was returned a second time
from the faena' e, with the amendment of that body
lHSisted on, his blood was excited But when he
came to consider that that body had an equal right
wuh tbe House in the disposition of this subject,
that its mtmbers were a portion of the great con-
sti uent body, and that the principle of representa-
tion 'n the House did not so much consist in nam
bers as in direct reoponsibility of the Representative,
he was willing to meet the Senate on half-way
ground, and felt that tne privileges of the House
had not been impaired
When it was said in the Senate that the House
was a turbulent body, and that the coun'ry had
lost its confidence in it—which confidence could
only be restored by a reduction of the members—he
did not regard the remark, inasmuch as he looked
on it as a mere figure of rhetoric He w as aware
that delay in legislation was often earned by the
House, yet he thought the people had the mtelli
gence to know that that was one of the inconveni-
ences which they had to suffer as the price they had
to pay for their libeities
The gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr Cbsh-
ino] had drawn a parallel between the rights of the
two Houses, and had asked if any one wou'd have
ft It his rights invaded, had the Senate filed its
reasons in the State Department for passing this
bill Assuming that no objection could be made
to such a course, the gentleman had asked, why
should not the President have the same privilege?
He answered him by saying that there was no ob
jec 10 i to the President giving his reasons through
the public paper , but not by filing a paper in the
Slate Department
The gentleman from V rginia [Mr Wise] had
attempted to shield the President under the mantle
of Gen Jacksor, who once approved a bill, and
put his reasons for so doing on it The gent'eman
from Mas ichus t s, [Mr Adams,] m reply, had
shown that there was no anal >gy oetween tbe two
cases Even if ther  was, precedent would not
make the action oí Mr Tyerlavtful The bil
approved by Gen Jackson was a bill authoriz n*f
c rta n w rks of m ern?l improvement *n Micbi
gan Gen Ja kson wa knosi  to b-opposed to
such ireibures. IuMi Ty'er oulc1 have had no
=uch tbjet o's to the present bill as «ere enter
lamed by Gen Jtck on If he ¡ ¡>d, he might have
e e red m Ore journals ot the Ho i«e, which would
lave «hiwn tha' s mt> of his strongest friends here
an! even tbe gen lemanf-omVirginia, [Mr Wise]
hod voted for the engrossment of this apportion
ment bill That gent'eman, af er a!1 the lignts af-
forded him, and after the district feature had been
inserted, in i fleet voted tor it, by voting against the
mo'ion ol tbe gentleman from Maryland [Mr. W.
C Johnson] to lay it on the table. He was sur-
prised to hear the gentleman from Virginia de-
nouncing this bill as one which was passed bjr
"brute force," and by a "Federal majority " If it
was passed by biute force, the gentleman added to
that force the momentum of hii weight. If it was
passed by a Federal majority, tie gentleman lent
his name to swell the very majority of which he
complained.
Mr. C here referred to a number of the Demo-
cratic members by name, (passing high eulegies on
several of them,) who had voted for the engross-
ment of this apportionment bill, against which so
much complaint had recently been made, and
which the country was persuaded to believe was
passed by a party vote. When the question was
on ordering the bill to a third reading, it was voted
for by several of the Democratic members After
the fractional principle and the district feature had
been introduced, the following gentlemen, by voting
against thp motion of the gentleman from Mary-
land [Mr W Cost Johnson] to íay the bill on the
table, in effect voted for its passage:
Messrs A V Brown, John Campbell, Reuben
Chapman, Edward Cross, T W Gilmei, Charles
J Ingersolí, Wm W Irwm, Cave Johnson, John
W Jones, John Thomson Mason, William Par-
menter, George H Proffit, Almon H R ad, Hop-
kiss L Turney, Harvey M. Watteroon, atd H nry
A. Wise—16 voting for the law
Notwithstanding these facts, in effort w-s ma-
king to produce the impression that the Democratic
party ha I votel against the mea ure en masse.
Ihe journal would show that, without their aid,
the bill could not have been passed.
The gentleman from Virginia [Mr Wisi] had
said that some regarded this bill as recs.mmenda-
tory, and some as mandatory, and that many of
those voting for it would not have done so, bad
they considered it in the nature of a mandate to the
States to district themselves Such the gemlemaa
from Alabama [Mr Shields] had dec'ared to be
his position The President, in his exposition, took
tbi same view, and said.
"One of the prominent features of the bill is that whicn pur-
ports to be mandatory on the ¡states to form districts for the
chotceof Rcpiesentatives to Congress m single districts That
Congress itself has power, bylaw, toaltet Stale íegulations
respecting the manntr of hoi ling elections for Representatives,
is clear but its power to command the States to imkr new
legnlations or altet then existing regulations, is ti c q ie:> ion
upon which I felt deep and strong doul s Ihavt. jiokled these
doubls, however to the of mion ofthe Legislatuie givng effect
to their enautrrent as fat as deperds on my tpprota ion and
leaving questions which may arise hereafter (if unhappily such
should arist. ) to be settled by lull cons <lei ation ol the several
provisions of the Constitution and the laws and the authority
of each House to judge of the elections, returns, and qttalihca
tions of its own members "
He desired briefly to answer th  construction of
the President, and hoped ihe íeporters would note
his answer He rtgarded the bill as neither a'to-
gether recommendatory nor commandatory I' a as
not commandatory from Congress, but from the
Constitution—that instrument which all regarded
as a bond of union, and which not only this Con-
gress, but hkewise the State Legislatures were
bound to obey, and which every  nan, having ihe
spirit o a patriot and ihe heait ot a man, was un-
der obligption to defend It was not an original
question of Stale rights No State could send
members here without adop ing ¡he Ci nstitutlon
He quoted from the Constitution, to «how that
Comjress had the power to make regulado s for
presenbinz the mode of electing member "The
times, plsces, and manner of holding elections for
Senators and Repre enlauves,surtil be prescribed in
each State by th" Leaisltture thereof, but ihe
