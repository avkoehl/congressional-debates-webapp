CONGRESSIONAL GLOB .
space He implored gentlemen, therefore, to pause,
and reflect upon what an extraordinary spectacle
they were presenting to the ej es of the American
nation The whole country was laboring under
deep excitement, and the public mind was abso-
lutely sick in the anxious expectation that this body
would do something fonts relief, and they had now
been in session upwards of five months, without
making any progress or advancing one step in af-
fording the relief asked And here was the House
engaged in an idle pursuit, in a wild crusade, after
the lost rights of the members He would say that
this whole proceeding, from beginning to end, was
irregular, and he admonished gentlemen that, if
they persisted in pursuing this matter, he should
leel compelled to introduce a resolution directing
the select committee to report a reciston of the
original resolution.
Mr S concluded by expressing his sincere thanks
to the distinguished gentleiran from Massachusetts,
[Mr Adams,] foi the noble and dignified stand he
had taken on this occasion That gentleman had
shown himself not only the advocate of membeis
on that floor, but the advocate of popular rights
generally Mr S said he proposed, in a spirit of
frankness, in a spirit of peace, and for the purpose
of expelling from that hall the demon of discord,
to lay the whole subject on the table, and, on that
motion, h«, asked for the yeas andnays, which were
ordered
Mr GRANTLAND hoped the gentleman would
not press that motion, and as he wished an oppor-
tunity of stating his reasons against it, he begged
to be allowed to do so
The CHAIR reminded the gentleman that the
motion was not debatable.
Mr RUMSEY inquired if, should the subject be
laid on the table, it would require two thirds to
call it up"
The CHAIR said that, as it was a privileged
question, a bare majority would be sufficient, when
it was reached
Mr. GRANTLAND inquired if the motion to
punt could be coupled \ ith that to lay on the table1
The CHAIR íephed in the negative
The question was then taken, and the House re
fused to  lay the subject on the table—yeas 48,
nays 131
The subject was then announced from the Chair
The question was on the motion of Mi Toucty,
under the direction of the committee, to punt the
report and testimony, with the subs'itute of Mr
Adams, to recommit with certain instructions, to
report me facts, "without comments or arguments,"
to which Mr Loowis moved the following amend-
ment "except as to the question of a breach of pri-
vilege," and Mr Reed the following to the amend-
ment "and ii a member prove to be involved, they
shall not proceed against him, but shall make a
special report of that fact to the House "
Mr RARIDAN satd the resolution, with in-
structions, as then pending, would place the sub-
ject before the committee in its original situation
He would not take the ground that the committee
was not authorized to make an investigation He
had been opposed to the argument, but in making
an investigation, and coming to a conclusion, he
thought they were correct, and ought to intimate to
the House the course which they thought ought to be
pursued But whether there was a breach of pri-
vilege, or not, was a question of law, under ihe
rules of the House, and he could not see what
course could have been pursued by the committee,
except to take the testimony, and iorm a conclu-
sion He thought the intention of the House «as
to instruct the committee to inquire, and having
inquired, and having come to a conclusion upon the
question of a breach of pi ívilege, were thev tokefy
that conclusion m their own breasts'? The committee
could not cause a member to bs artested and put
upon trinl, but they were instructed to inquire i*to
all the facts connected with the death of Mr
Cn ley The evidence was properly taken and was
properly before the House He hoped the House
would take the evidence, and let all the rest pa's
as a work of supererogation He had formed con-
clusions m hts own mmd, which he had laid before
the House in writing, with the hope that it would
be printed and go before the country    However
much he wished to have the subject disposed of, he
did not wish that the House should avoid the re-
sponsibility and throw it on the committee.
Mr R then offered a resolution, which he de-
sired to have lead for information, and said when
it shou'd be m order he would submit it to the
House, as follows
W lincas, it is manifest from the eudence taken
bv the select committee charged, &c thai the Hon
W J Graves, the Hon. Henky A Wise, the Hon
Richard M&>,ef.fe, the Hon. Georgs, W. JoNts,
the Hon Jess*. A Bynum, and the Hon Alexan-
der Duacan, membeis of this House, were con-
nected by their acts, advice, and conduct, with the
duel which terminated m the death of the Hon
Jonathan Cilley, and that they were therein guilty
of invading and violating the privileges of this
House
Therefore, resolved, That the journal kept by,
and the evidence taken before, said select com-
mi tee be printed, and referied to the Committee
on the Judiciary, with instructions to report a bill
defining the pnvikges of Congress, and for the
punishment of the viohtions thereof, and also to
repoit a plan for the trial of the abote named mem-
bers, oi such of them as in the opinion of said
committee are, for then conduct above referred to,
liable to punishment by this House
The CHAIR said this proposition was not in
order till the pending motions were disposed of
Mr Rk,LD was anxious that the subject should
be brought to a conclusion, but in the proper way,
and foi this reason he had submitted his amend-
ment
Mr GRANTLAND was indifferent about what
instructions were given to the committee, but he in-
sisted that the papers should be printed It had
been alleged that the tesiimony was not fairly taken,
th s he pronounced to be false, let it come fiom
whatever quarter it might, and he urged the printing
of the whole subject, so that the public might be able
to judge He denied that there was any pditical
feeling in the committee, for their proceedings were
conducted win extraordinary unanimity, and he
only few d ffuences that existed were mere shades
Mr G called upon all who knew him to testify
whether hp was one likely to be operated upon by
such influences as hid been stated
Mr DAWSON bore testimony to the fact ad-
verted to by hts colleagu"
Mr RIVES said he would make a motion
which, he hoped, would be acceptable to all par-
ties ot the House, and especially so to the gentle-
men implicated He moved to postpone it till the
fir«t day of June, and asked for the >eas and nays,
which were ordered
Mr WILLIAMS ef Kentucky inquired if this
motion required a % ote of two-thirds'!
The CÍIAIR replied m the negative, but the mo-
tion took precedence of the motion to recommit
Mi.MENEFEK opposed the motion, because,
he said, it was an indirect mot on to get rid oí it
entirely, and against suih a disposi*ion he entered
his solemn pióte t Moreovei, to print such a pa
pet, and postpone its consideration, would be a
manifest injustice to the partías implicated, who
were now íoady for trial, and anxiously awaiting
it, as it w on d 1 eep <i sentence of condemn ition
impti dirg   vei their heads
Mi RIVES SAid he «as as anxious as the gen-
tleman lor bringing this subject to a correct and
speedy conclusion, but the votes of tli s morning
showed they c uid not do so
Mr B'VNUM adverted to the announcement
made in Mr Rar te\ s piopos lion, as changüí?
his determination to have no partis pation in this
debate, but, sirce it was announced that he and
others not before named were to be tried, he m ut
be allowed to express his oppositii n to the proposed
postponement, \ 'ule a ehaige affecting his honor
aid his character isas circulating all over tit
countrj Mi B was then proceeding to urge the
pubheut on oí tne testimony, and to give his rea
sons why it should not be suppressed, in justice to
himself, the committee, the House, and the coun-
trj, but the Chair ruled out the discussion, as not
m order on a mere motion to postpone to a future
day
Mr RIVES then interposed, and said that he
had made the motion, in the hope that it would
meet the general assent of the House, and be taken
to-day, findmg that not to be the case, and the gen-
tleman from North Carolina expressing a wish to
reply to the gen'leman from Indiana, [Mr. B-ari-
din,] he Mr Rives, would withdraw his motion.
He again repeated the hope that the question would
be disposed of to day
Mr R having withdrawn the motion, the ques-
tion recuired as first stated above
Mr BYNUM stated that he had no particular
objection to the resolution pending, nor had he any
to that of the gentleman from Indiana, and should
most cheerfully vote for it, but he could not help
saying that it was altogether a novel proceeding,
(or he had had no notice given him, no oppor-
tunity of furnishing testimony, &c The gentle-
man from Massachusetts had asserted that this was
a party question, and, so far as one side was con-
cerned, this movemert showed that t was so Mr.
B then defended the cour a of the committee, and
pronounced the allegation that they had made one-
sided report to be both a foul and false one.
As to recommitting, he could not see what was
to be gained by it, lor after the committee brought
in then second report, the subject would be in the
same situation before the House, that it was at this
ti e lie was willing now to meet any charge,
and he wan led all the facts to be known to the
House, and to go forth to the country, and
let him be judged oy his constituents, by those
to whom, next to that House, he was re-
sponsible Besides, let the House carry
through what they had begun, and not be intimida-
ted or deterred by gasconades and threats, or by the
appiehension of any consequences that might grow
out of it A.s to the objections urged against the
proceedings of the committee, oh the ground of
«ant of technicality, they were ridiculous, mere
spider weo and wue drawn distinctions about
nine < b«olete foims, devoid of all substance or me-
tenality Then let the House meet the questiou,
«ilhout shudd Ting < r seeking to evade the respon-
se  1 tj, or, if they suffered themselves to be alarm-
ed by threats or bullying, let them tell the ountry
so and let others of more firmness be sent in their
places He hoped, men, that some decision would
s^on be auived at, and that if he was to be tried,
they would tiy him speedily
Mr THOMPSON adverted to the vast amount
of public business pending m the H use, and ex-
pievsed his regret that any charge should be sus-
pended over any members of the House without a
hope of coriect fina! action He thought the
House ought to share m the responsibility of the
committee, and, though it was known that mem-
bers were involved, yet it did not appear legally
by the record, and he thought it ought not to be
taken by implication, as a precedent pregnant with
evil He wished the report might go back to the
committee with instructions to report the evidence
alitady taken, and their journal, as soon as may
le, and he read a resolution, which he said he
shou'd move, uí>en m order, to that effect Mr
T made some remarks touching the merits of
the case, whicn tne Spe4kír ruled to be out of
order He wished the evidence might go to the
w< rid, that a correct judgment might be formed
The ques ion then r curre i upon the amendment
off. nd by Mr REED to the amendment of Mr.
LOOMIS, which, being taken by yeas, and nays,
was decided in the negative, yeas 79, najs 82
Mi DAWSON then moved to lay the whole
subject on the table, except the evidence and jour-
nal, and that they be printed
Mt 15 supported his motion by some remarks,
tending to show that a recommitment would only
piocluee a great consumption of time, because there
«i-re six ^.ent'eoien turn prfsenfd before the
House, «hi would "¿cu demvnd a tnal and those
trials would rtquuc all the time mat «ould be
cuisumed in the e son, to the postponement of
the pubhi business, and without ending, as nine-
tenths of the House believed, in any definite action,
or in any beneficial result
He urged that nothing more could be effected
than bv a trial of the member* for a violation, di-
rect!} or indirectly, of the laws of God and man,
te produce an impression upon the public mmd,
