THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 6,
been in vain to apply for information to the body
of the directors
The President, therefore, addressed a letter to
the Government directors     There was no secrecy
enjoined in it, as had been contendtd     It enjoined
on them not to take rumoi or newspaper puoliea
tions for their guide, but to let their infoimation
come from  their own actual knowledge    The
simple injunction upon them v.as, to give him
what they knew to be true, because he had a pub
lie duty to perform, which made it necessary tor
him to know the conduct of the bank     Mr W
herí read a letter of Mr  Crawford's, dated  3d
July, 1817, addressed to the directors of the Bank
of the Unued States, m leplyto the complaints
which had been made against the bank on the sub
ject of the internal ex< hanges of thecounlry    1 he
letter was written with the knowledge of the Pres
ident, and claimed the right to apply to the Gjv
ernment directors alone  for   intoimation      1 he
Piesidenthad the light then, and it was the duty
of the directors, to answei as they did   1 hey we e
public officers, and, by the words of the chaiter,
the President could remove them     And how had
they perfoimed their duty ?   Notas spies, but as
trubty sentinel1) they had given the truth in a man
ner which would justify the Sena'e m confirming
their nominations     Since  this   discussion   com
menced, he had adverted to another fact     Heallu
ded to the recent refusal of the Bank of the Uni
ted States to transfer the books and papéis relating
to the Government pensioners    The bank direct-
ors say the Government had no authority to make
this requisition    This Mr W consideied another
link in the chain of hostility which had long actu-
ated the directors towards the Government     The
bank says the business is of no consequence to
them      Tney only withhol 1 the books and papers
to see that the laws mefaithjulbj executed—on them
devolved the duty of the Piesident     The requi-
sition of the Secretaiy of War to make these
tiansfers did not relate to pensions under the act
of 1818    It refeued to the pay law of 1832.
The requisition to transfer is by a pay law, not a
pension law It only sought to transfer the funds
to the banks select ed as the public depositories, and
it was done by the Secretaiy of Wai to avoid the
embairas->mentof transferí ing funds Irom the local
banks to the United States Bank to meet the
applications there If the bank wished to piomote
the good ol the country why did they not give up
the books and papers? oi why not pay the pen
«loners? But they would doneithei, they showed
a disposition which every man ought to resist In
inflicting distic-s they did notspaiethe holy rem-
nant of revolutions y officeis, so swetping we.e
their exertions that even the suiviving soldiers of
the war of independence were notspaied In vain
did those patriots achieve the puze which we aie '
now enjoying, m vara did 'hey shed then blood if
we ate to submit to an oligarchy which stands in
the hall of our independen! e, if we are to submit
to rulers who are attempting to oppie'S us
Fie proposed now to take up and examine the
resolutions of the gentleman from Kentucky   The
first lelatestotheassumpt on or political power by
the Piesident    It charges him with no corruption,
but rather that he h is paiticular views and opinions
as to the powers of removal of Executive officers
He (Mr   W ) thought that the Senate would ac-
quiesce in thepoioei of removal, when they were
confirming or rejecting nominations every day
This resolution admits the right of removal, but
simply charges the President with a usurpation of
powei     It seemed divisible into two parts   the
first ieteirm¿ to Mr   Duane, the second to the
appointment of Mi   Taney     With regard to the
formergentleraan, there was somethinscso peeaiiai
11 his situation in reference to the c pnions of the
President, that it was impossiole the P esident
couiu retain mm, if upon personal considerations
on1/     What was Mr   Duane's situation?    He
came into office holding odiihoiis adverse to the
Pres dent's     Avoiding to his own views, when
he entered the Cabinet the Chief Magistiate was
arbitrary in his acts, suirounded by & cabal, had
no f x°d principles, o>- if he had any, he carried out
none of them     Under these c remittances he was
ca'led to a seat in the Cabinet among the Pi esident's
confiden'ul advisers and counsellors, to aid him in
admimsteung the affairs of Government, andhavmg
these secret opinions, that eveiythmg was proceed
ing from conuption, how could they pull togetl er?
But tn's was not all He tells the Piesident, you
j are governed by ro consideiation foi tne puolic
good—your veteare vile, vindictive, and arDi'rarv
Vindictive and arbi'iary are his very epithets
How, 'hen, was it possible that a Secretary of the
Freasui y, with these sentime us, could c< operate
witn the Piesident?
Yet this was not all     When serious difficulties
were likely to arise in the councils of the nation,
he promised  to resign, and atteiward  refused,
the promise, when made, he did not expect t> be
called on to fulfil, and he determined to remain, to
fix on the President the chaige ot inteirenng wi n
the duties of his. office     Fne President was ugh',
therefoie, in removing hnn—he hcJ the powei to
uoso by the Constitution and laws, us exetcise was
i not dan¿eious to the liberties of the people, it was
| no assumption of power    The E<i cutive was ím
pressed with theconv.ction that the removal of the
deposites was necessaiy, and it was his duty to
'alte the step he did    Ihe ngnt of removal cf the
officr was admitted, on the principle that the Pres-
ident was lesoonsible for the faithful execution of
the laws     But it was argued that the Treasury
was notan etecu'ive depaitment, aid not under
the supervision of the President, that the Secretary
was not lesponstble to the E-ceeutne, but to the
legislative bianch of the Government     Njw, all
the laws which speak of that depai tment, speak of
it in noothei character than asan executive depart
ment    The office , subject to removal by the Pies-
ident, is a member of the Cabinet suuoundmg the
Executive   To be sure, the purse and the finances
ot thenauon are under the control of Congress, but
when Congress has passe 1 laws and irrpo ed du
ties, then the executive power attaches   Congiess
had passed a law imposing a duty on theSerieiary
But the pel foi manee of that duty was placed undei
the care of the Presiden      The omission of the ,
word executive, in the law of '89, was entirely acci- '
dental    By turning to the laws passed at the same
Congress, it will be found that it was only an omis
sion     Mr   W   read from a law of that yeai, for
paying the salary of the Secretary of theTreasuiy,
"as one of the executive officers of Government "
In all the laws on the subject, the Secretary was
íccogniaed and called an executive office'    Mr W
here rtad various jiasstges from the Constitution,
and Kent's Commentaries on American Law, to
show that the Executive may leqnne the opinions
of eithei of the heads of departments in writing,
and that General Hamilton was called on by Gen-
eral Washington, as an executive officer, to give
him his opinions     It being an sxecutive depatt-
ment, then, the President, under his gereral power
-ind duty to see that the laws aie faithfully execu-
ted, wis bound to watch and see the pioper time I
when the removal of the deposites should take j
place   This constitutional injunction never was to
be suspended, either in time of peace or in rebel-
lion—a geneial power of supeivision was indis-
pensable m eveiy well regulated Government, and
the injunction to see that the laws weie faithfully
executed, was connected with his oath of office
In exeicismg this power, he interfered with no duty
of another officer    The law had given the Secre-
tiry the power to remove, but was silent as to the
time and manner of removal     Suppose Congress
should adopt the second íesolution, and order the
íesLOiation of the deposites,  and  the Secretary
should refuse to execute the order, you might im-
peach him, but would it be a w.se couise? When
a rational calamity was prevailing m the nation,
would it be light to wait for a tedious investiga
tion ?   Ei ei y man would call for his removal, and
if the President should refuse to remove him, uni
versal condernnat on would follow the conduct of
the President     Suppose it had  been absolutely
and undeniably necessai y to remove tuedeposites
and the Secretary had refused   would the President j
have been justified m not removing bim ?   The
Presilent, then, was justifiable in the removal of)
Mr  Duane     Mr  Taney succeeded him   not be-
cause he moulded his opinions to the will of the
President, but because he had given an opinion in
favor of tne removal, when in another high office
under the Government   It was no sudaen opinion
of his     As early as March last, Mr Taney was
of opinion the deposites ought to be removed, and
the bank ought to prepare to wind up its concerns
Mr i aney came into office to execute an act upon
which nis opinion coincided with that of the Pres-
ident It was right if the President entertained
the opinion he did, to select an officer holding his
opinions it was no assumption wha ever When
did a President ever se'ect the head of a department
nci. holding his opinions? It was aiways the right
of the Piesident to select a person agieemg with
him, and Mr Taney came in with nonoi to exe-
cute whit he had advised to be done
Mr W1LK11NS, at thtee o'clock, gave way,
without com luding, to a motion, by Mr CLAY,
to a Ijotrn, but ~n
Mi WEBSTER'S suggestion he v/ubdrew
the motmn Mi W then gave no ice that when
Mr WILKIiSS concluded to morrow, he would
move to go into tne consideiation of executive
busne s
The Senate then adjourned

PENSION LAWS.
The order of the day was thei declared tobe the
resolution of Mi Chili ov, to appo nt a select
committee to inquire into ti e expediency of so ex-
tending the general pension law as to embrace
witl in its provisions those persons who were en-
gaged in the Indian wais, down to the year 1794,
and «he amendment of it by Mr Boülew, to ap-
point a committee to inquire mto the moral effects
of the pension system upon the community, and
how far it ought to be abo'ished or repealed
Mr CHAMBERS, who had the floor from the
previous day, said that he believed both public
pnnc pie and policy was involved in the present
question, he, therefore, desred to assign the reasons
which should govern his vote Many arguments
certainly been  adduced m   support of the
had
extension of the pension system generally, which
were of more than ordinary interest, and were
entitled to ihe grave consideration of the House
They had heard during the discussion eloquent
eulogmms upon the merits, and expressions of
sympathy for the sufferings, of those engaged in
those Indian wars, Calculated to awaken a strong
feeling in their behalf. Trese were of such a char-
acter as not to be heaid with indifference,for they
were calculated to raise the Amencan character, as
they brought foi th to public notice men pieviousiy
but little known to fame He had listened with
ueiight to the panegyrics oestowed by the*memoer
fiom Kentucky, yethe feltsome regret at the cen-
sure vhich he seemed to cast upon Geneials Har-
raar and St Clair, m their defense, however, n&
thought it only necessary to say that the>, not-
withstanding all their m.sfortunes and distress,
continued to retain the confidence of the Patherof

at the praises thus bestowed, he felt constrained by
