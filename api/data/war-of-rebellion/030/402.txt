MURFREESBOROUGH, November 13, 1862-2.30 p.m.

General BRAGG, Tullahoma:

Brigadier-General Wheeler has just arrived, and is ordered to the front to relieve General Forrest and organize cavalry. He shows me order of November 3, received at Tullahoma, for him to remove troops and stores from Spart, Carthage, and Red Sulphur Springs to Murfreesborough. I know of no stores at Carthage and Red Sulphur Sporings, and those points are within enemy's lines. Shall troops and stores be removed from Sparta here or to Tullahoma? I have ordered Colonel Morrison, in command at Sparta, to scout well toward the Cumberland, and think we can hold Sparta and McMinnville for some time yet. No news of advance of enemy. I send General Wheeler to the front, under a later order from General Bragg to report to me. There in said to be a large wagon train at Sparta. I do not know its object.
