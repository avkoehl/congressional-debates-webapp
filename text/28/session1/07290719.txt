The Tariff-—Mr. Severance.
H. of Reps.
16 What is this for? Cant we make our own brick? 'Are
we going to raise a revenue on imported bricks and paving
tiles?
Paper. The duty is high, varying on writing paper from
17 to 12£ cents per pound. Printing paper pays 10 cents
per pound duty, and the paper may be bought at that price,
I have mysell bought a great many thousand dollars worth
at a price per ream estimated at 12£ centfe perpound, If
duties, were taxes to the amount of the duty, I must have
paid heavy taxes on printing paper for the last nineteen
years, during all which time I have been advocating the
protecting policy on this very- same taxed paper, while my
own business has not been protected by it all: for books
and newspapers are cheaper in this country than in any
o her on the face of the globe. I am willing the duty on
Eaper should remain as it is, for paper, like every other
ighly protected article, is every year growing cheaper,
and improving in quality. -
Sugar. Here is another favorite. The present duty is
2k cents per pound, which the committee estimate at from
65 to 120 per cent. They propose to reduce it to 2 cents
per pound, which, in some conditions of the foreign market,
and on some qualities, will be not less than 100 per cent.
Now Why is this high specific duty retained on sugar,
while almost every thing else, except iron and" spirits, is
reduced to 25 per cent.? "Why, for example,, is salt put
down to 20 per cent, by this bill, while sugar is kept up to
neaf a hundred per cent.'* In time of war we- could do
without sugar, but not without salt. There is more rea-
son then lor protecting salt than sugar. Besides, there
is no other article in the list of duties, .which looks
so .much-like forcing production, and upon which the
duty operates so nearly as, a tax on the consumer,
as sugar, simply from the fact that there is only one small
district in the southern part of tbe State of Louisiana where
sugar from cane can be produced; and this district cannot
supply the United States. Yet I have no desire to disturb
the present duty, if the other provisions of the tariff are let
alone; but if wool, and woollens, and leather, and all their
various manufactures, are to go down to 2-5 per cent, ad va-
lorem, I do not see why sugai should not go dowrf too, and
all take their chance together. In its extent and importance,
the sugar interest is far inferior to that,of either the woollen,
the cotton, or the leather manufacture. Even the manufac-
ture of paper is greater in value than sugar made in the
country from cane.
Potatoes. By the present law these pay a specific duty of
10 cents a bushel When prices are low. this is a high pro-
tection. It prevents the prices from being run down by
bountiful crops and heavy importations'lrom the British
provinces on our eastern border. When potatoes are scarce,
and bring a high j>rice, the 10 cents a bushel is a much
smaller per centage. When potatoes "sell in Boston for 50
cents a bushel, the 10 cents specific duty amounts to only
20 per cent.; but when potatoes are 20 cents a bushel, the
10 cents duty is equal to 50 per cent. The specific duty of
10 cents is, therefore, just tne thing that is wanted by the
farmers of Maine. They do not want a duty that shall ena-
ble them to get enormous prices in time *of scarcity, but one
that shall prevent foreigners from overstocking the market,
and reducing the price below what it ought to be. The ta-
ble to which I have so often referred, and which was pre-
pared for the committee at the Tieasury Department, esti-
mates the 10 cents specific duty as equal to 24 per cent—1
cent less th^n the duty they propose, and they say this cal-
culation is based on actual- imports and valuations at the
custom-house. If so, this valuation must rest on extraordi-
nary high prices. Potatoes often sell in the Bay of Fundy
at from.17 to 20 cents; and when there is a great supply,
may be delivered in Boston at 20 cents, which would make
the present duty -50 per cent.; but at 30 cents a bushel, the
present duty would be 334 per cent., which is better than
■25. I think, sir, the specific duty of 10 cents, now existing,
is altogether better, both for the American consumer-and
producer, and certainly more effectual for protection than
an ad valorem duty of 25 per cent, as proposed m the bill;
for if, in time of great scarcity, potatoes should rise to a dol-
lar a bushel, the 25 per cent, would add 25 cents to the cost,
instead of 10 cents. For the same reason specific duties ate
better than ad valorem on many other things.
Foreign fish, dried or smoked. The drty is $1 per 112lbs.,
or 44 per cent. Thia is to be reduced to 25, and does not
look much like protecting our fishermen. Do the commit-
tee wish to import foreign-caught fish, and thus foster the
great nursery of British seamen, instead of our own? Do
they wish to educate hardy sailors for the British navy, in
preference to preparing them lor our own in time of war'
Then let them reduce the duty on fish, and repeal the fishing
bounties. Labor is so much better paid in our own coun-
try than in Europe, that there is already much difficulty in
getting a supply of American sailors. Our vessels are in
great part manned by foreigners, because our own people
can do better on land than go to sea for wages which for-
eigners are glad to get. Let our fisheries also pass into for-
eign hands,'and what condition should we be in to fight the
greatest naval power in the world, if, unfortunately, we
should ever be again driven to that extremity?
Mackerel, (foreign-caught,) pickled or salted, now pay
41 50 per bbl., equal to 32 per cent., herrings $1 50, equal
to 29 percent.; pickled salmon $2, equal to 19 per cent.; all
other fish, pickled in barrels and half barrels, $1 perbbh,
equal to 37 per cent All these are by the bill brought to
the level of 25 per cent. The present specific duty is every
way more effectual for protection, more easily ascer-
tained, and greater in amount, and I hope it will not be
changed,
Castor oil. Here is an item, not great in importance. I
notice it as one of the few articles on which the specific du- i
ties are retained. The entry in the table of present duties js I
•'40 cents a gallon—none imported." And w-hy is none irn- j
ported"? Simply because, by means of a high specific duty,
the foreign article is excluded. The duty is prohibitory in
pfiecrt; and, according to the democratic tariff' doctrine, is
unconstitutional. Why did not tht? committee put this at 20
per cent, also, so as to make it a revenue duty, by allowing
importation? I hope it was not because castor oil, likesu-
gar, is'produced in the southwestern States. But as there
are so many other things in this bill worse to take than cas-
tor oil, I will pass on to distilled spirits, which, ii' not worse
ty take, are wesrae t&ken,
Brandy pays a dollar a gallon by the present law, equal to
180 per cent. The bill does not propose the uniform 25 per
cent, ad valorem, but makes a great reduction, which, i
suppose, is intended for that portion of our population who
do not'belong to the cold water army, and for whom whis-
key and New England rum are too vulgar liquors to get fud-
dled upon; or perhaps the calculation is that we may raise a
great deal more revenue by importing, and of course drink-
ing more brandy and other spirits at lower duties, and thus
be relieved from "oppressive taxes" on "articles of neces-
sity."
The same policy is pursued in regard to wines; which by
the bill are all brought down to 2o per cent, duties. This
must be a great relief to the "laboring classes,"-and is un-
doubtedly a genuine democratic measure; but how it can in-
crease the revenue I am unable to see, unless by greatly in-
creasing the consumption of the liquor; for very little wine
is made m the country except that which is made by an
adulteration of "villanous compounds."
Tobacco, manufactured other than snuff' and segars, now
gays 10 cents per pound, or 44 per cent. And on this the
ill-maks no reduction. The committee seem to think that
manufactured tobacco is entitled to a protection of 44 per
cent.; but wool, woollens, leather, and all .other manufac^
tures except bar iron, are entitled to only 25 per cent.
There are many other alterations of the tariff proposed in
this bill, which are equally objectionable, but I have not
time to notice them. The tariff of 1842 was framed after
very careful inquiries into the state of each particular busi-
ness, and the amount required for a just protection: while,
at the same time, with a wish forecast, it was well adapted
to revenue, as experience shows. And now it is proposed
to destroy the beneficent work which was accomplished
after such patient investigation, and to substitute in its
stead a bill which makes little or no discrimination, but
chops ofl everything to the length ol its procrustean bed-
stead, of 25 per cent, ad valorem, excepting the favored ar-
ticles of sugar, tobacco, iron, distilled spirits, and castor
oil.
Sir, I have before me a small pamphlet, which I under-
stand has been largely circulated by members of the major-
ity of this House. It is entitled "National Debt, as it was,
and it is." The title needs the addition "as it \v ill be if this
bill passes." The gentleman fro*i Kentucky, [Mr. Davis,]
and the gentleman from North Carolina, [Mr. Clingman,]
have shown bow that debt was made. I now propose
to show that, instead/of being paid, as it will be if the
present tariff' is permitted to stand, it will be increased
if this bill passes. As a revenue measure, the bill will be
equally disastrous as in its effects upon the currency and
business of the country.
Lot us see what wc can exjjectfrom it, judging from the
past. In 1840 the duties subject to biennial reduction under
the law ofl833, averaged above 25 percent. And what was
the amount of revenue that yearfrom imposts ? By turning
to table L, m the annual report of the Secretary of the
Treasury, made in December last, it will b.j seen that the
net revenue fro.n duties,- after deductingdrawbacks, fish-
ing counties, and expenses of collection, -w as only $10,159,-
339. How much better should we stand under this bill?
Since then wt put 20 per cent, duties o.i French silks, and
wines, in 1841. called the little tariff, and have still further in-
creased them in 1842, and we retain specific duties on iron,
sugar, and spirits. Let us see how these will be likely to
swell the amount, and then what the committee themselves
say about the condition of the finances in 1840 The in-
creased duties proposed in this bill, above what the duties
were in 1840, will not produce over $3,000,000. which would
leave only $13,000,000 of revenue. Add $3,000,000 for land
sales, and we have $16,000,000—less than half as much as
Mr. "Van Buren's administration expended in a single
year. Bui the committee calculate no doubt on a great
increase of importations over those of 1840. How
long1 can such importations la<it when our manufac-
ufactures shall have been crippled, and our artisans ha\e
turned to faimers to produce gram and meat that cannot
sell? General embarrassment wiJl prevail, and we shall
cease to import, when we can no longer pay. We shall
have idleness, poveity, failures, and banluuptcy, and the
revenues* will lull off a.b thej did 111 1840 Now, let us s ee
what the committee say about the condition of things at
that time, "brought about, as it was, in a gieat measure, by
the reduction ot the tariff under the compromise act. Speak-
ing of the deficiencies of the revenue, the committee say,
page 10—
"These have necessarily increased, as the reduction ol
duties under the compromise, act have proceeded, until the
final fall of every rate of duty to 20 per cent or under, on
the 30th of June, 1842. The sudden and heavy reductions of
duty on the 31st of December, 1841, and the 30th of June,
184.1, (being the ia«t under that act.) were well calculated to
alarm the fears of the manufacturing interest, if not to pre^s
severely upon their business: and, in the face of an unsup-
plied treasury, and a rapidly increasing public debt, it was
to have been expected that they would make a further effort
lor renewed protection *'
Certainly it was. And what reason have the committee
for believing that similar reductions :of duty now will not
pioduce the same results?
Sir, to my apprehension, this bill is not founded on any
sound calculations of revenue, while in its bearings upon the
industrial interests.it will be every way, not merely inju-
rious, but disastrous to the public prosperity. While the
experiment of the tariff' of 1S42 is working so well, 1 think it
would be very unwise to disturb it,
It has been said that the duties m the present law could
not stand a moment each on its own merits, but that they
were obtained by combinations of different interests. It may
be true to s-oine extent that \ otes have been so influenced.
Our federal Union was originally but a combination of mu-
tual interests for mutual support and protection, and so it
remains. The tariff'of 1942 was voted for as beneficial in
the ag'giegate. Each member ot Congress who voted for it,
if he look so narrow a view of his duty as to regard only
the interests of his own district or State", no doubt behoved
the law on the whole would be beneficial to his district or
State. Congress is, however, the legislative bodj of the na-
tion. We are not the mere agents of the State we repie-
sent, nor at libertyho disregard the interests of e\fery other
St&ie. If Vermont, for instance, should ask for A high
duty on wool, and oppose a duty on hemp:-if Kentucky
went for hemp'and against wool: Pennsylvania went for
iron, and against sugar: New York for sslt and woollens,
but against both sugar and iron; and all other States should
act in the same way: if the hatter and the shoemaker should
unite to refuse protection to the tailor: and the shoemaker
and tailor against the hatter—we could all easily succeed
destroying each other; but we prefer rather to support and
sustain each other, as well in our business interests as in,
defence against a military enemy. If a foreign army should
invade New Jersey, it would hardly do for New >orkand
Pennsylvania to say they had no interest in tbe matter, be-
cause their territory was not yet invaded; yet such a dec-
laration would involve'no greater absurdity than for Maine
to refuse all protection to iroft, hemp, and glass, because
she makes none, or Kentucky to refuse all protection to our
shipping interests, because she has no seacoast. By sustain-
ing each other, we carry out the purposes of our Union,
protect the interests of labor, increase the power of the na-
tion, and promote the happiness and prosperity of its peo-
ple.
I do not feel myself permitted to legislatefor Maine alone;
yet, under the protection which the law of 1842 affords, if it
shall come to be regarded as the settled policy of the coun-
try, I have the strongest conviction that Maine wiJl share
very largely in the general benefits of that law. Her water
power is unequalled Her rivers, and the streams from her
numberless lakes and ponds, will be lined with flourishing
villages, occupied by a people busy in the manufacture of
wool, cotton, glass, leather, iron, and wood, in all their
forms of use, while the lands in the vicinity will be highly
cultivated, and rendered valuable by the demand for their
productions, which will be caused by the mechanical, man-
ufacturing, and trading population in their vicinity, and all
together creating and stimulating an active foreign as well
as an internal and coasting trade. With protection for our
labor against the starved and servile labor of the Old
"World, I have no doubt that we in Maine can use our hands
to good advantage, and pay our way, without any danger
of State bankruptcy or repudiation of our honest debts.
Sir, I believe the law of 1842 needs very little amend-
ment, and certainly not the sweeping destruction which this
bill proposes.
Extract from Mr. Hudson's report from the Committee
on Manufactures.
Salt.—The opposers of a protective tariff have generally
selected salt as one of the cases which bear particularly
hard upon the people. Salt, we allow, is a necessary of
life, and must be consumed in nearly the same quantities,
whether the price be high or low. But there are strong
reasons why the manufacture of salt should be encouraged
in the country. It is necessary to national independence.
The evils we suffered, and the high prices we were
compelled to pay, during the last war, should admonish us
not to depend upon a foreign market for a supply. We, at
the present time, manufacture at least one half that is con-
sumed in the country. This .shows that our duty upon
foseign salt is not prohibitory, but such a duty as produces
a fair competition. The following table will show the
amount of import and export for ten years:

Jt will be seen by the above table that we import about
6,SoO,000 bushels of s-alt for home consumption, and it is a
fair estimate to say that we manufacture the same amount,
yi/a 6.350,000. This manufacture is distributed through
the Union, being carried on in eighteen of the States and
one oi the Territories. Our population at the present time
cannot fall much below 20 C-00,000. and the quantity of salt
imported being 6,350,000, would be less than one third of a
bushel per head. Now, if the price of the salt impoited
were increased to the amount of the duty, it would only im-
pose a tax of 2| cents per head upon our population. But
even this is a greater burden than the people are called up-
on to bear. The price is not materially increased by the
duty, as the list of prices given below will make apparent.
The domestic mamrfaeture suppljing one half of the de-
mand, the quantity imported i& so small that no inconsidera-
ble shaie of what is imported, is brought in as ballast; but if
our domestic salt works should be destroyed, and our whole
supply should be imported, most of it would be brought in
as freight, and hencc at a gieater cost This fact, together
with the domestic competition, seems to keep down the
price.
We give below a table of prices at Boston for forty-eight
j ears, together with the rate of duty ; and if any person can
dihcoverany particular influence which the dut/ ha* had
upon the price, it is more than we have been able to per 
ceive. Tne prices in 1814, 1815, and 3816, were occasioned,
not by the duty, but by war in this country and in Europe.
