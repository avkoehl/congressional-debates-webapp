HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,OFFICE ASSISTANT INSPECTOR-GENERAL,

February 25, 1865.

INSPECTOR-GENERAL ARMY OF THE POTOMAC:

SIR: In reference to the alleged insufficiency of rations as now supplied to the honor tomake the following report:

In the First Division of this corps the opinion among commanding officers is general, in the Second Division, with one exception, universal that the present ration is insufficient even for troops in camp when the picket and fatigue duty demanded of them is as arduous as it now is. On the march, when waste is more or less unavoidable, it would, without question, prove very inadequate. The deficiency is found in bread and meat, and also sugar. An increase of two ounces each in the bread and meat ration and of four pounds per 100 rations in the sugar would probably suffice.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHAS. G. LORING,

Brevet Colonel and Assistant Inspector-General.

Major-General ORD:

Early is said to have moved down the Nine-Mile road yesterday, and to be occupying now a large field or race-course between the York River and Fredericksburg roads. This may indicate an advance of the rebel rams and an attack on you. Great vigilance ought to be observed on your right, and in case of firing on the river every man should be got under arms and in his place.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
