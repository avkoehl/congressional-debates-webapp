FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863-5.45 a.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

Heavy cannonading in Sedgwick's front for the last twenty minutes, apparently in front of Fredericksburg. No reports yet.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD.

FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863-6.08 a.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

Balloon reports the enemy reappearing on heights in front of Sedgwick's crossing. Sedgwick, judging from the sounds, is meeting with strong resistance. I have no reports from him yet.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863-6.20 a.m.

General HOOKER:

Sedgwick reports himself at Sumner's old battle-ground at 5.30 a.m., hotly engaged, and not sanguine of the result.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863-6.20 a.m.

Major-General SEDGWICK:

Have telegraphed your dispatch to General Hooker. You know how much depends on your pushing, and, of course, will do everything in your power. I have directed the engineer officer to report for orders to you concerning the lower bridges.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863-6.45 a.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

Sedgwick's prospects here look unfavorable, from reports. He is not out of Fredericksburg.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.

FALMOUTH, May 3, 1863-7.05 a.m.

Major-General HOOKER:

Sedgwick still in front of Fredericksburg, as far as I can judge. Trains were running up all night to vicinity of Hamilton's Crossing. It may be that the enemy were re-enforced.

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.
