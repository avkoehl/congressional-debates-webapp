What arms do you need for the Eleventh Kentucky Cavalry? I will have them sent at once, if possible.

Have the regiment of Morrison's brigade that is at Green River sent to Columbia. Have Henshaw's battery sent to Glasgow. Send these troops by train or over the road, as you think best. Leave the Sixty-third Indiana where they are for the present. If you have already given orders starting the Sixty-third Indiana for Glasgow. you can replace it on the railroad by the Sixteenth Kentucky.

General WILLCOX, Lexington, Ky.:

Have Welsh's command moved to Columbia as rapidly as possible, and report its arrival by telegraph. Tell Carter to keep a good lookout, and prevent the enemy from crossing at Robertsport and passing up by way of Liberty. I will have the cavalry from Columbia occupy James-town and watch Creelsborough and Burkesvillee. Welsh will draw his supplies from Lebanon, and Carter and Sturgis will accumulate at once ten days' supply of small-stores from the wagons and three from the haversacks, with fifteen or twenty days' beef-cattle.

General WILLCOX, Lexington, Ky.:

Gilbert's reconnaissance to Cumberland Gap is very creditable. I am anxious to receive his written plan for an attack. Let Sturgis' division halt at Carb Orchard for further orders. I am very much afraid we shall be troubled in getting up supplies. Do Carter's quartermasters act energetically? How is he off for ammunition? If he cannot supply himself with subsistence while he is at Somerset, he certainly cannot when he moves to the front. Does he transport salt meats? He should carry nothing but hard bread and small rations, and live on fresh meat.

CONFIDENTIAL.] MAY 22, 1863.

Colonel HARTRANFT, Lancaster:

You will please start the Second Division for Somerset to-morrow morning. As the road from Stanford to Somerset is already crowded with trains for the troops now at Somerset, you had better move at least part of the division by the Crab Orchard road, if you think it will facilitate the movement. Acknowledge receipt of this dispatch, and let me know what regiments will be ready to start to-morrow morning.
