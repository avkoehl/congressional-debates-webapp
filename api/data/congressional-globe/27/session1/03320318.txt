the Inl' It related totwo classes of case**, voluntary bankruots
who applied for the benefit of the law on their own account, and
involuntary, m relation to whom application was made by their
creditors, and it referred to contracts not futme, but aheady ex
isting To the objection that in this respect it violated the pro
vwk n of the Constitution which forbade the States to pass any
law lmpaning die obligation ofcontiacts, Mr R replied that
the woids of the Constitution made a mat lied difference in the
prohibition imposed upon States and that imposed upon the
Geneial Government Ihe latter was prohibited from 'pass
ingany bill of attainder or ex post facto law " There it stop
ped Now an ex post facto law had been decided to mean only
a criminal statute, and not a law of a civil nature, andtherefoie
the restriction did not prohibit Congress fiom passing a cml law
ofa retrospective character lint when the Constitution spoke
of Sate*, it added to the foiegomg woids the following "not
any law impahmgthe validity of contracts ' The introduction
of this clause in the latter place proved, by a well known pnnci
pleof interpretation, that it& omission in the other ca*=e was in
tentional and significant, and Mr R contended it was not less
wise and( vmcive of foresight in thefiameis It was conceded
that S ates might pass bankrupt law ofa prospective kml,
until Congress should interfere by a geneial law ^uch a law
existed 11. the State ot New York but if a bfate made the
law retrospective, it was uíicon°titu(ioiial But Congiess
could pass a general law which shou'd be íetiospective as

who would ha c been the last voluntaiily to ha\e infeifeied

Mr F then went mto aconstit itional aigument reading au
thouties to sbow what hi 1 been the received acceptation of
the term "bankrupt" at the time the Constitution had been
ft ame 1 and contendel that no subsequent e lange in Us mean
ins would wairant iri m < rp-e <Hion uiconsi-vtent. with the
I nown meanm  of the words when they were inserted m the
instrument He admitted that the British law fiom which this
meaning had been derived was a narrow law, and he might
wish it had been more liberal, but this conferred no power
on Congress to change the meaning of the terms of that or-
ganic law by which Congress itself, as *\ ell as the nation, were
bound This was not a question of implied, but of granted
powers The íesort must be to the letter of the Constitution
A bankrupt law had been intended as a shied to cieditors
against tne fiauds and injustice of dishonest deb ors, hut this
bill convened the shield into a swoid to be put into the hands
of the debtor
Mr F insisted that the law of 1800 had not been retrospect
ive—it was prospective only A  to the difference of Ian
guage employed bv the Constitution in lestrictmg th( States
and restricting the Geneial Government, he thought theargu
ment woith little, because, as the General Government was
the creature of the State=, and had no poweis but such a¿ were
ei anted to it, it needed no restriction on a power not gianted
whereas the btates being ongmal depositories of power, did
ncediestnctions m the exercise of powers which they did pus
sess, and might otherwise have exerted No matter wherher
an ex post facto law was strictly restrained to cnmmal cases
a retrospective bankrupt was m the nature of an ex post facto
1 iw, and to pass it would be to violate the spirit of the Consti
tution A law was mile of action, b it how could a law be a
rule to a man's- action which was not passed till ten 01 twenty
years aftei the action had taken place1? He considered such a
law as oneoi the most tyrannical exercises of powei which the
imagination could conceive No precedent for it was to he found
since the daik ages If the state of the community required re-
lief let the relief come from the pioper quarter—from the Ie
gislatuicsof tlv1 States or from the mercv and consideration
of the creditor, which was íarely appealed to m vain by an
honest debtor, who could show a clear case and make a fan sur
lender
Mr a opposed the law is not being uniform in its opera-
tion, and therefore not constitutional He argued this point
from the different hens cieated by the laws of different States
on the property of debtors

Wednesday, August 11, 1841.
The PRESIDENT laid before the Senate a com-
munication from the Secretary of the Treasury, in
compliance with a resolution of the Sena e, giving
a list of all articles imported duty free, or bearing
a less duty than twenty per cent, zd valorem, with
the amount of duties paid on, and value of, those
articles 1837, '38, and '39, which was laid on the

Both resolutions lie over one day.
Mr. CALHOUNpres nted a memorial and teso-
lutions adopted a few days since by a large and re-
spectab e number of the citizens of the Isle of
Wight county, Virginia, at a meetins held m the
court houce cf thecoun'y. The memorial and re-
silutions are couched in most rcpeetful terms, but
at the «ame time express in strong lan,uage the
opm on-s of the meeting, thit the measures attemp -
edtobe forced upon the country at this extra ^es-
srn, are not ¡>npriived ot by the grtat body of the
people of ih" United States. Much had been said
in praise of the histy action of the other House-,
designated so emphatically a' g'onous" Hou=e, be-
cause of its. precipitate action; but he, (VIr Cal-
houn,) would venture to say that n ver were mea-
sures so repugran' io tne great bod} of thf people,
as these very pessares for the ha ty passage of
which that Hou'-e had been so much la' d d The
people  never could, be would i'nhe^'ta'mgly ?«sert,
be brought to oelieve thit a Na ¡o =l Bank—na-
tional df b — distribution—and high taxauon, were
reasons for which then wpre-entatives would be
entitled to their thanks. Th<*e who wanted such
measure  might cpII it "glorious" legislation; but
the people never would approve of such mea ures.
He held that the people had a right to be heard,
and he would therefore content himself, for the
