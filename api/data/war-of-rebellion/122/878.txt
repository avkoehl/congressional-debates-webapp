Messrs. COOPER & HEWITT,

17 Burling Slip, New York:

GENTLEMEN: Your communications of the 29th and 31st ultimo I am directed by the Secretary of War to acknowledge, and to express his high appreciation of your energy and promptness as business men and your public spirit and patriotism as citizens. The Government relies for success in this war upon the hearty co- operation of the patriotic and capable men of the loyal States. Your suggestions by letter and telegraph in regard to the construction of the mortar beds and their transfer when finished to their destination have all been adopted and promptly attended to. In case the cars are not forthcoming at the proper time, or the arrangements in any other respects should fail, advise this Department by telegraph and a prompt remedy will be applied. If you deem it expedient to employ a special agent to follow the mortar beds along the line of the railroads to see that they do not stop before reaching their destination, you are authorized so to do, being careful to make an agreement with him for a definite per diem compensation for this services before he enters upon his duties, at a reasonable rate. Arrangements will be made as speedily as possible to place funds in your hands to meet all the disbursements involved in this transaction. Please advise this Department by telegraph of each shipment of the mortar beds at the time it is made.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.
