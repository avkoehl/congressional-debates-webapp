point, my escort company, Fourth Ohio Independent Cavalry, Captain Foster; Lohan's escort, company A, SECOND Regiment Illinois Cavalry, and Crocker's escort, Company E, SECOND Illinois Cavalry, Captain Tipton, and Company C, FIFTH Regiment Missouri Cavalry,* Lieutenant Mueller, were organized into a battalion of cavalry, under Captain Foster, and performed most efficient services as advance guard and flankers.

On the 12th, at 3. 30 a. m., Logan's DIVISION moved toward Raymond, followed by Crocker's at 4 a. m. Soon after starting, the enemy's vedettes showed themselves frequently, making increased vigilance on our part necessary, and after marching some 3 miles, two regiments of Dennis's brigade were deployed, one on the right and the other on the left of the road, and moved forward in line of battle, preceded by a strong line of skirmishers, and followed by the remainder of the columns, the cavalry in front being called in and placed on the extreme flanks, with instructions to explore all lateral roads, and detect any movement of the enemy.

About 11 a. m., and when within 2 miles of Raymond, we came upon the enemy, under the command of General Gregg, and 4,000 or 5,000 strong, judiciously posted, with two batteries of artillery so placed as to sweep the road and a bridge over which in was necessary to pass. The major portion of the infantry were posted on a range of hills to the right of the road, and in some timber and ravines in their front. I was soon satisfied that the fight for Raymond was to take place at this point. Orders were immediately sent back to move all our trains out of the road, for the remainder of Logan's DIVISION to advance as rapidly as possible, followed by Crocker's, which was to form the reserve.

As soon as Smith's brigade came up, it was formed on the right of Dennis', who occupied both sides of the road, and three regiments of Stevenson's were thrown in on the right of Smith's, with directions to advance his right as much as possible. De Golyer's battery was placed in position in the road near the bridge, and the whole line ordered to advance into a piece of timber. Scarcely had the advance commenced, when the battle opened with greatter and left center, where, under cover of the woods and ravines, the rebels seemed to have massed a large portion of their force. The Eighty-first Regiment Illinois Infantry, of Stevenson's brigade, was ordered to the support of the center, and a portion of Sanborn's brigade, Crocker's DIVISION, but before the latter reached the ground, the enemy were handsomely repulsed and in full retreat.

De Golyer's battery, which at first was in position on the road, having been moved into an open field on their left, played on their flanks during the retreat with terrible effect.

One attempt of the enemy to charge and capture the battery was met by such a terrific fire of grape and canister that they broke and fled from the field.

Pursuit was immediately commenced, and the town of Raymond was entered by our troops at 5 p. m., the enemy having passed through without stopping, toward Jackson, via Mississippi Springs. In this short but spirited engagement our loss in killed was 69, and among them Colonel Richards, of the Twentieth Illinois, a most gallant and able officer, who was struck down at the head of his men while nobly cheering them on to victory. Our loss in wounded was 341; MISSING,
