THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
July 24,
i 03 j co
These tables are taken from the records of tho
clerks, and as tho accounts of the clerks up to a very
recent date have been passed upon and approved by
the proper officers of the Treasury Department, the
tables may be relied upon tor years prior to 180S as
absolutely correct, and for the year 1868 as equally
8«, subject to whatever error may be discovered in
the accounts not yet reached. Tins element of un-
certainty for the year 1868 must bo very small, since
among the thousands of accounts sent annually to
tho Treasury Department for revision the discovery
of any error whatever is of raro occurrence.
These tables would seem to constitute a full com-
pliance with the order of the House, and tho com-
mittee might leave the subject hero but for some
matters which came to their knowledge during the
investigation, and which being connected with the
subject-matter the committee deem proper to be
presented to the House.
It came to the knowledge of the committee that
one >V. J.Manker,who had boon in the Doorkeeper's
department knew, or professed to know, some viola-
tions of law in the disbursement of the contingent
fund. The committee accordingly summoned and
examined Mr. Manker, and his testimony, with that
of some other witnesses, accompanies this report. It
appears from the testimony of Mr. Hanker that ho
held the position of messenger under the Doorkeeper
from about March 4,18G7, to July 1, instant. That
about the commencement of tho present session he
had some disagreement with Mr. Edward Spieer,
superintendent of the folding-room, about some
inonoy, S350, which the witness alleged to be due
him, the particulars oi which will appear in a sub-
sequent part of this report.
Being unable to get the money, Mr. Manker, as ho
tells us, set about to discover irregularities in the
management of tho Doorkeeper's department. He
believed there were irauds there, and he confesses
his intention was to possess himself of sufficient facts
to put the Doorkeeper in his power, and thereby com-
pel him to pay the money.
Mr. Manker's investigations were conducted with
protound scerecy, and continued from early in last
winter up to about the last of June. Ilis success in
tho Doorkeoper'sdepartment stimulated him to fur-
ther inquiries. and he attacked the departments of
the Clerk, bergeant-at-Arms, and postmaster, in ail
of which he dLscoveied, or thought he discovered,
gigantic iuiquities. The result of this investigation
appears in a printed pamphlet of thirty-eight pages
which be produced before the committee, and a copy
of which accompanies this report.
According to his own testimony, when he had pre-
pared himself with what he deemed the evidence of
fraud contained in the book, he communicated with
sevoral of the Republican Representatives from his
own State, Indiana, and the result was that some
tune in tho present month an interview took place
between himself and Mr. Hunter, Messrs. Cobtjrn
and Shanks being present. He seems to have im-
pressed these gentlemen with the opinion that ho
had been injured, and according to his account of
the interview they were disposed to see hini righted
if that would end his quarrel with tho Doorkeeper
aud reconcile him to Mr. Cobuiin, at whose instance
he was first appointed, and whom he accused of neg-
lecting his complaints. He says his investigations
and book cost him $200, and that, ho asked &350 to
suppress the book. One of the gentlemen remarked
Urn tthe transaction looked liko black-mailing,where-
upon the witness became greatly incensed and refused
to treat further.
It is proper to state that Messrs, Huxteu, Cobuiin,
and Shanks, in their testimony, deny all intention
and ail propositions to purchase the book, their ob-
ject being simply to befriend Mr. Manker and end
his quarrel. Before this interview, according to his
testimony, he had opened negotiations with tho na-
tional Democratic committee, through Mr. Niblack,
a Democratic Roprcsentativefrom his own State, and
soon atterward succeeded in selling his book to that
committee to be used asa campaign documontfor con-
sideration which, to uso his own language, " was bet-
ter to him than to remain in the Doorkeeper's de-
partment and receive a year's salary." That salary,
he tells us, is §1,440.
It is proper to state that Mr. Manker tells us the
book is to be modified to somo extent in tho hands
of the Democratic committee, but he left the impres-
sion that tho proposed modifications were not im-
portant. The book, as reported, may therefore be
considered substantially as it will be given to the
world. It bears upon its title-page tho inviting an-
nouncement, "Tho Ventilation of the Radical House
of Representatives, showing the most intamous sys-
tem ot swindling that can be found in this or any
other country.''
As the misrepresentations are gross, and as somo
of them may be believed by the country,the commit-
tee have deemed it proper to oxamino and report
iroui undoubted official sources tho tacts so attempted
to be perverted. Tho committee owe an apology to
the House tor noticing such a publication A book
gotten up for the purpose of frightening the Repub-
licans into the payment ot money to suppress it, or
in default of that to sell it to theDemocrats for uso in
the coming campaign, might be well expected to be
made to answer its twofold puipo&o lfthewriter had
sufficient ingenuity to do it, but where the truth can
be so readily got at it is well that the House and the
country should bo putin possession of it.
The committee find the table on pages 4 and 5,
showing the expenses of the House for the lineal years
ending June 30, 1804,1865, IBM, 18(57, and 1808, more
pearly correct than anything else m the book, but it
duplicates the item of #100,000.
This was additional compensation to employ6s voted
in 1803, and is embraced within the amounts ascribed
to the years following that date.
Hence this sum has no business in tho tabic. The
actual expenses of thcso various years appear on* tho
books of the Clerk's office, and aro as follows:
In the year ending June 30;
1861  $328,384 20
lfc&j  482,834 00
I860  462,418 90
1S67  404,810 98
1868  085,281
$2,522,679 48
The figures in the book for 18G8, the witness admits
in his testimony, were partially estimated. This ac-
counts for there being $40,01)0 too much. The trifling
aggregate error in Mr. Manker's table of $140,000 may
not lessen the value of the book in the estimation of
the purchasers, but it is worth noticing. The increase
of 1808 over 1804 is accounted lor by the twenty per
cent, increase of compensation of officeis, clerks, and
employes, by the enlargement of the Capitol police,
by the increased sizeand expense of the Globe, grow-
ing out of tho frequent and long sessions of Congress,
by the creation of additional committees, anu the
incronse of committee clerks, consequent upon the
enormous increase of legislative business, by the
number of investigating committees, and contested
seats, by tho repair and refurnishing of the various
rooms in the Capitol, all of which was noglccted dur-
ing the war, and by the general increase of docu-
ments, the additional allowances for and consumption
of stationery and newspapers, consequent upon the
repeated convenings of Congress.
These expenses were necessarily incidental to the
entorccd antagonistic position of tho legislative body
toward the Executive, and they could not have been
avoided without infidelity t« the highest duties. In
the stationery statement (page 6) there are serious
mistakes. The table giving the stationery for 1868—
which must have been meant tor 1867, lor that of 1808
cannot bo ascertained until the end of thoyear—states
it at $77,500, and the commutation of stationery at
$22,150 is added by Manker, making a total of $39,650.
Tho stationery lor 1864 is placed at §36,600, and the
commutation $2,000, making a total of $38,600.
This, according to Manker, shows an excess for
1867, over 1864 of $61,030.
The books of tho disbursing officer of tho Clerk's
offieo show trie entire expenditure under each appro-
priation in each year, From them wo get the entire
amount of stationery and commutation drawn by
members ior tho years named as follows:

ery and comma- txon al-

For 1804 $24,312 So $4,633 74
For 1865   20,263 97 2,927 43
For 1863  34,382 05 9.^61 40
For 1807   56,484 03 18,994 26
I or 1868 (six months) 16.721 02 3.081 83
Brom this we find that the whole amount of sta-
tionery and commutation lor 1867 was $55,484 66,
instead of $90,650, as alleged in the book, and that
the increase over 1864 was $31,171 78, instead ot $61-
050, as alleged by Mr. Manker. It must be borne
in mind that in 1807 there were three distinct ses-
sions of Congress, and therefoie three allowances of
stationery to members, whereas in 1861 there was
but onosession and but one allowance. Most oi tho
actual excess was owing to this fact.
These official facts entirely destroy the assertions
of the book, and make ridiculous its attempts to ac-
count for imaginary excesses by imagining every
form of extravagance. The difference between tuo
facts and the book is,doubtless, owing to the circum-
stance that tho latter was made to sell and the for-
mer not The stationery alone without the com-
mutation for1SG4, was S10.679 11, and that for 1867.
$30,400 37. Out ot this latter sum the members wore
supplied upon their orders, the various offices of tho
Clerk's department, that of the Scrgeant-at-Arms,
tho Doorkeeper, and postmaster were supplied. ihe
wrapping-paper for ioiding hundreds of thousands of
documents for distribution among the people was
lurnished and a surplus left over of 92 with
which to begin the year 1868. On pageill it is alleged
that tho purchases of stationery for 1867 amounted
to $85,000, and the commutation for stationery drawn
by members $20,000, making a total of &10o,000,
whereas the fact is, and the records of the House
show it, that the entire purchases of stationery ior
that year were but §30,490 37, and the commutation
$18,994 10, making a total of $55,484 63, a little over
half tho alleged figures.
When we consider the discrepancy between the
facts and the allegation it is plain that some inge-
nuity must have been exorcised to render the book
valuable in the market for which it was intended.
On page 21 a comparison is instituted between
1808 and 1804, in the matter of horses and cariiage
hire and cartage, by which there is assigned to 1868
the sum of $14,213, and to 1804 $6,591, making an in-
crease in tho lour years of $7,019. A reierence to tho
Clerk's books shows that the following sums were
expended for horses and carriage hire aud cartage
during tlie following years :
1863  $8,419 00
1801  9,583 59
1805   10,7'JA 75
1866  I0,3u8 50
1807   12,<32 50
3S68 (six months olj  2,968 25
It will be seen that the book gives the alleged ex-
penses for the years ending June 30,1864 and 1868, re-
spectively, whilo the records of the Cierksoffioe give
us tho expenditure during each year from January
1 to December 31. Hcnce an cxact comparison can-
not be instituted, but the figures in the table enable
us to say with certainty that those in the hook are
false.
In these several sums are included the allowances
for keeping horses for tho publicservicebytheClerk,
Sergeant-at-Arms, and Doorkeeper. The number of
theso horses has been steadily tho same for morethan
eight years, so that the expense could not greatly in-
crease sinco 1864. On one occasion since that date
tho allowance in this particular was increased in
conscquence of theincreased costot keeping horses.
The actual difference between 1864 and 1868 is thus
accounted tor.
On page 24 of the book appears a table, the contents
of which are worthy the attention of authors who get
up statistics at will to prove what they desire. It pro-
fosses to give the expense of furnishing horses, car-
riages, cartage, &c. to the various officers of the House
with incidental expenses for the year coding June
30,1863, making tho total $34,653. Among the items
appears one tor forage for horses, ("estimated,")
&15.000. As this forage is purchased by the officers
and paid tor by them out of the allowance made to
them, (heretofore alluded to,) it iscMfficuit to see why
that sum figures in the expenses of the House. But
supposing his estimate of the cost of torage to be
correct, $15,000, and his statement of the allow-
ance made to officers in tho whole business to be as
he states it, $14,213, the keeping of horses tor the
transaction ol public business would not seem to bo
very profitable since tho cost ot keeping thom ex-
ceeds by $/87 per annum the entire sum allowed the
officers lor horses, carriage hire, and cartage. In a
succeeding table on the same page a like ingenuity is
exhibited. Tiie Chief Cieik is alleged to have re-
ceived st-,.528 allowance lor three horses and carriages
to which is added $3,750 for forase, under the ialse
assumption that this is paid for by the Government 
u keeping these horses to Mr. Liojd is

of $2,o23 allowed him by the House toi keepiug them.
