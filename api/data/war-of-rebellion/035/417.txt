Major General H. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief, Washington, D. C.:

I understood that General Orders, Numbers 103, only meant to include the troops in this department, and have so worded my order.

Our cavalry crossed the Cumberland this morning, under Colonel Kautz, and drove the enemy 4 miles beyond Monticello with trifling loss to us and considerable to them.

General BOYLE, Louisville:

General S. D. STURGIS, Lexington, Ky.:

The following has just been received from General Hartsuff:

Judah telegraphs no additional news. Nothing from Glasgow; nothing confirmatory of Carter's report that rebels have crossed in any force. One thousand cavalry are now after the rebels who appeared at Edmonton; Judah thinks he will catch them. Have ordered Hobson to columbia, and have sent with him the Thirteenth Kentucky from here. Shall send five companies of the Twenty-fifth Michigan also. Boyle says he can use convalescents to replace them. Columbia is the weak place, and this place is protected by it and Glasgow. Will keep you informed.
