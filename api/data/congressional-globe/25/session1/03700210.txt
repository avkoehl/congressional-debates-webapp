that the curiency less sound, and less safe, is con-
fined to the people. Take this fact m connexion
wi'h the facr, tint the major part of the circulation
is now, and likely will be, bank paper, and upon
<he pi niciple ol the distinction drawnin the message,
the conclusion is irresistible that theie will be an
eviJusue metallic medium for the Government and
its officers, and a medium mainly paper lor the
people The bill now under consrdeialion, as docs
the message, draw  the distinction, and us conse-
quences must follow Can this be sound policy '
Is not the distinction invidious i Does it not make
the Government supreme1 whereas the people
should be, and are súpleme1 Sir, in my humble
opinion, it strikes at the very foundation of ours>s
tem , it makes the people subordinate to the Gov-
ern nent, whereas the Government is subjidinate
to the people I know, sir, this is not designed by
the President, but it is the inevitable result of the
distinction Mr Chairman, there is no sound
leason tor this, distinction, none whatevei, the busi-
ness transactions of the people aie minutely greater
and more e\tendet!,and theieforeoi greater mteiest
than tint oí the Government, and demands the
soundest medium for then operation If, then, the
metallic be the only safe and sound medium foi the
Government, it is necessanl} more important for
the people, ii the paper medium be sale and sound
for the people, theie is no reason why it is not
equally so for the Government, and, instead of the
Govej ii men t d lsparagmg and discre tiling the med 1-
um necessanl} belonging to the people, it should,
by the judicious employment oí it> immense leve-
nues, aid in pieservmg its safety and soundness,
and extending its credit This Government
is chaiged by the Constitution with the jegu
lation, the encomagement, and protection of com-
merce, it could not more successfully perform that
(lutj than by giving it111 credit to the geneial circu-
litrag medium oí the country, so long as it is
worth) Sir, the conviction that the proposed sys-
tem contains this usjust, and anomalous, and
lmidrous distinction between the Government and
the peoplo, is last nveted in my mind, and, if ture,
ought on that account, rf no othei, to be repudiated
The sixth objection which I urge to the piesent
system rs, that it will greatly aid, if not render
indispensably necessary, a national bank I assume
n as a fact, which the experience of the past wtll
justifies, that, unless this nation and the States of
this Union shall abandon its commerce, their sys
ttms o internal improvement, so floutislung and so
r tti lly mue is n ', and then literary institutions,
that the banking system in some iorm will be main-
tained, they have increased, ant1 will continue to
increase as the wealth, population, manufactures,
apiculture, and commerce oí the countiy in
creases The President himself expresses the
opinion, in his message, that the States will not
amnion then s5stems oí banking The power of
tai butts o uicoi oi ate these institutions, and the
i.aui ol harmony irr the exercise oí this power, has
lender edit dilhtult even with the aid ol the na-
tional revenues, and the advantages ot national
tiedit to piesent a sound medium of circulation,
and perform the hscal and commercial duties vvhith
have devolved upon them It, then, they aie fai-
ther discredited by the passage of this bill, and
then opeiations reduced to narrowei bounds, it is
manliest that they will not be able, and w ill not have
scfhcient credits to supply the country with a sale,
sound, and ample commercial medium, fur without
titdrt, they aie totally inefficient It readmitted,on
all hands, that while gold and silver are sale and
sound, they are not ample and convenient, hence
the country will demand some other medium to
k ep pa< e with its rapid improvement, and that will
be a national bank medium In the necessity of
the dem md all tonstituttonal scruples wnl be over-
k >'if>d and a natitnal institution incorporated
Sri, Í shall not, if here, vote foi it, but be assmed
that the over v helming influence of pubhc discon-
tent vull as in 1810, drive to this resource, and
«lien again established, it will obtain a hold w Inch
nothing tan break, and will with all its obnoxious
and fatal tendencies be the permanent policy ol the
country. This brings me to consider whether the
passage of this bill will not discredit the bank papei,
and impair its value as a circulating medium If
tne course already taken by the Treasury Depart
merit towards these institutions, the calling of Con-
gress together on account of the suspension of
specie payments, the recommendation of the mes-
sage to discontinue them as depositories, and the
receipt of their notes in payment of the public
revenue, if the charge of the Executive that they
have been faithless fiscal agents, more so than the
Bank of England under like circumstances, and
the sanction oí these charges by passing the present
bill, be not sufficient to discredit and cupple these
institutions, then there is no cause wnatever but
absolute unqualified bankruptcy that would dis-
credit them We already see the blighting influ-
ence which the withdrawal of the confidence of the
Government has exerted upon the banks, and we
may well anticipate the fatal effects which a blow
from the representatives of the people Mill produce,
ill of which will ultimately act upon the people, m
the great scarcity of money and reduction in the
value of their property
This is not all, Mi Chairman, this measure, I
fear, if adopted, will exeit a still moie fatal influ-
ence upon the banks than any which 1 have attempt-
ted to pi edit t I lear it w ill ultimately, if not imme-
diately, utteily destroy them, and produce a s'ate of
i mn and desolation, it is appalling to contemplate
The connexion and union between agriculture,
m niufictuies, and commerce is so intimate, that
one cannot be affected w ithout, af the same time,
aflectrng the other, whatevei cause thtiefoie that
impairs the credit of the eommei'-ialmedi mi of the
country necessanl} inflicts a serious injury upon
agriculture and manufactures particularly agricul-
ture, for that is the foundation of commerce and
manufactures These banks are an essential and
necessaiy pait of the commercral commumtj, and
whatever embariasses them, embarrasses the whole
commercral community This idea is very forci-
bly expiessed by Mi Calhouv m a speech deliver-
ed m 1816 in this house on the barUchaitet, speak-
ing of the commeicial qualities of the then propo-
sed Bank of the United States, he says, " This bank
is no moie than a pan of the commercial communi
ty, in which rt is established, and any embarrass-
ment of the bank must pi ess, also, on the whole com
munrty, that coinniimtii would be thcfir^l to giteu ay
in such a case, and thrs would produce a íun on the
bank, and compel the stoppage of payment " I
cjnno' imagine to rnjself a moie decisive step, in
the present embairassed condition of the country
an I the binks, than the passage of this bill, to force
the banks to continue the stoppage of pa\ ments and
finally to wind up then business If such would be
the effect what would be the consequences to the
people 1 I let the Pipsident of the United States,
when he was Governoi of New York, answei In
his annual message to the Legislatuie ol New York,
Mr Van Buien, speaking unon the expediency of
renewing the elm tcis of many of the New ^ ork
banks, which were a'out to expue, portrayed the
ruinous < fleets which their discontinuance would
produce upon the S ate and the people, expressed
himscii in these foicible and conclusive terms

We '
Mr Calhoun, in a speech in the Senile, m 1834,
speaking upon the subject of the banks and the ef-
fec's of their sudden suppiession, thus expresses
himself, "To supptess them (the banks) at once
would, if it were possible, woik a gieakr icioluhon,
a greater change m the relative condition of the va-
rious classes of fhe community, than would the con-
quest of the countrj by a savage enemy " This
sentiment is true, mcv 'tablv ti ue, and by it I propose
to test the effects which the destiuction of the banks
would at this time produce upon the people In
1854, the people weie indebted to the banks
p.324 000,000 in lSST.^Ol.OOO.OOO if then the sup-
pression of the banks in 1831 would have produced
such distressing effects, what would it do now i
Rum the w hole community When the banks are
pressed, they pi ess in turn the whole community,
and that presses the people, who aie the victims,
for they have no debtois to resort to, the} must re-
sort to their proper ty Again If the Government
demands specie m payment oí the public revenue,
the merchants must in turn demand specie of their
debtors, the plopce, which, if they cannot procure,
will lead to the mo't destructive sacrifices m the
sales of their propel ty No ti editor is Lound to i e-
eeive any thing but specie, and this system will af-
ford a pretext for such a demand, for the creditor
may well refuse to receive discredited, depreciated
bank papei, and therefore cause immense sacrifices
of piopeny
Mr Chan man, the bank circulation is already
leduced fiom about 160 to 100 millions of dollars, as
is also the active specie circulation greatly reduced,
the present ciiculation is founded upon an adequate
specie basis, and cannot, with due regard to the ín-
t rest of the people, be further reduced This sys-
tem will lendei a further reduction inevitable, and
produce a eonespondmg inability on the part of the
people to pay dpbts, and a fearful depreciation m
the value of propeity, and m this point of view will
opeiate most injuriously upon the debtor class ol
the community
The eighth objection which I have to the propo-
sed system is, that it w ill greatly enlaige the Execu-
tive patronage, and fearfully increase its power
Upon this point, Mi Chan man, I am brought into
diiect collision with the opini in of the President,
who seems to ba of the opinion that this measure
will not only not tnaeuse but actual y diminish Ex-
ecutive patronage I am not satisfied with the rea-
soning of the message, and find nothi ig in it, al-
though ably utged, to change the opin-on which I
took up in 1831 as to the effect of such a measure
The Secietaij of the Trea&ury seems to ihink that
by the appointment of len additional officers and
an mcieased expenditure of about 60,000 dollars,
will enable that department to conduct this system
with success In this opinion, Mr Chanman, I
differ widely with the Secretary, although I do not
doubt his sincerity A 1 piopositions for the crea-
tion of new sjstems are accompanied with the
most rigid íegard to economy, but afiei their
organization their wants gradually develope
themselves, till finally, by legislation aitei legis-
lation, the officers and the expenses aie fear-
fully increased All the departments of the
Government had small and economical beginnings,
>et in the progress of time the nuinbti of their of-
ficers and the amount of then salaries, and other ex-
penses, have greatly increased, such will be the
course of this sy s'em This w ill be but the germ, and
your ten addi lonal office's and $¡>0,000 additional
expense, w ill swell into hundredsoi officers, and hun-
dreds of thousands ot increased expenditure. To
tell me that all the increase of cleiks, house-rent,
stationery, and other incidental expenses which
this system will require can be met with $00,000, is
to tax my creduli'v with the belief of an utter im-
possibility Sn, the Secretaiy of the Tieasury
will find himself utterly mistaken is h.s estimate, if
by the passage of this bill, he shall be authorized to
put this system into prac ice In considering this
question it should be bon e m mmel that our coun-
try is rapidly increasing in population, wealth,
power, and commerce, and that necessanlv as these
progress mcieased duties on the part of"the Gov-
ernment in all its depanmen's will be unquestiona-
ble, and on no department of the Government
will these increased duties devolve so materially as
on the Treasui y department Hence, sir, I looK to
the adoption of this sjsem as laying the founda-
tion of an immense mciease of ti e patronage of the
Executive in the appointing and d'sbuising power
Mr Chairman, the patromge of the Executive is
the most dangerous of all its powers, and the most
hi ely to end in the overthrow of the liberties of the
country, by the exercise of this power, fhe Execu-
tive ramifies in every section of this widely extend-
ed empire, its officers indebted to the Executive for
their appointment, and holding them at its will.
When we consider their numbei, the influence
which they exercise, and the positions which they
oecupv, we cannot but feel sens bly alive to the
misehiefswbic'i they may produce 1 hen number
already exceeds one hundred th.otis.ard, and is con-
stantly increasing—add to this immense array of
public officers ramifipd into eierv spction of the
country, the amount of money which is annually
disbursed by the Executiv e, «md we may form some
idea of the already fearful pow er of the Executive
atronage But, sir, pass this bill, and this power
ecomes ten fold stronger and more dangerous.
Now the Executive has not the actual but the legal
custody only of the public purse, barriers hitherto
