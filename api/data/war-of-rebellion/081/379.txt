General HUMPHREYS:

I have taken a prisoner from Bushrod Johnson's division in my front. He reports large bodies of troops having passed down railroad toward Weldon, stretching out Beauregard's command. He reports that enemy have fallen back from the position in my front. I have ordered out scouts to ascertain, and send you the news.

D. B. BIRNEY.

Major-General.

[Indorsement.]

Forwarded to General Wright. This would confirm your theory. What is the cavalry doing? Lose no time in getting some positive information.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC.

June 24, 1864-8.30 a.m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

Dispatch received. Send the prisoner up at once. A dispatch has just been received from Wright saying our cavalry had advanced on his left nearly to the railroad without encountering any of the enemy. Still, Wright was of the opinion last night that the main body of Lee's army had passed to our left along the railroad.

GEO. G. MEADE.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS.

June 24, 1864-9 a.m.

General MEADE:

A prisoner who has just come in and whom I questioned (he has been just sent up) says there is a great movement of troops of the enemy this morning. They were drawing rations, &amp;c. He says the troops he belongs to (B. Johnson's) moved out of their intrenchments covering the railroad, and that when he was taken there was only a skirmish line. He says many troops marched up the railroad yesterday, probably Hill, and that a great many troops have arrived within a day or two from the West or somewhere; that the ambulance train of his division went back into the intrenchments this morning.

D. B. BIRNEY.

Major-General.
