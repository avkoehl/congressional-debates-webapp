* The return of the Trans-Mississippi Department for September, 1864, is unintelligibly prepared, and the usual form of abstract cannot, therefore, be compiled. It shows, however, a "total enlisted present" of 45,927; "aggregate present," 52,867; "aggregate present and absent," 76,834.

+ Dismounted.
