SAINT JOSEPH, July 8, 1864.

Major-General CURTIS,

Commanding Dept. of Kansas, Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

Mayor Beller, of Weston, telegraphs us that that place is in imminent danger, but does not state the nature of the difficulty. We apprehend it is threatened by a party of about 160 bushwhackers that attacked Parkville yesterday. In the absence of Brigadier-General Fisk I have the honor to request that such a force as you may deem necessary to be sent to Weston to exterminate the rascals. We have every available man already in Platte and Clay Counties under Lieutenant-Colonel Draper, but they are too low down the river to meet this gang.

I have the honor to be, general,

G. A. HOLLOWAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

WYANDOTTE, July 8, 1864.

General S. R. CURTIS:

Eighty men, under Captain C. T. Taylor, attacked Parkville, with a company of Red Shirts back in the woods as reserve, who did not come in town. Came in from direction of Hampton; went back same way. Took breakfast at David Gregg's, five miles from Parkville. Lieutenant Noland wounded.

THOS. J. WILSON,

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,Santa Fe, N. Mex., July 8, 1864.

Major P. W. L. PLYMPTON, Commanding at Fort Canby, N. Mex.:

MAJOR: I desire that you send to the Bosque with the next party of Navajos all of the Apache prisoners who were brought in by Captain Pfeiffer's command. If there be danger of their escaping en route the men of those prisoners should be ironed. By having some of the Arizona Apaches at the Bosque, I can, at the proper time, send some of them out into their own country with such intelligence as may induce others to come in. It is important that every Navajo Indian should be sent to the Bosque at the earliest practicable day. I wish to break up Fort Canby as soon as possible. Please send me and express the day the next party starts, with an account of its strength, the number and description of its stock, &amp;c.

I am, major, respectfully,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF NEW MEXICO,Santa Fe, N. Mex., July 8, 1864.

COMMANDING OFFICER, Fort Stanton, N. Mex.:

SIR: The commanding officer at Fort Craig reports that a party of forty Indians have crossed the Rio Grande between that post and Fort McRae, going east. Be on the lookout for them, and destroy them if possible.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. CARLETON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
