nays. I want members to understand what ex-
traordinary privileges they are granting to this
monster corporation. If they understand it fully
they never will fix this Bank of Commerce under
the general national hanking law—never. Jf
there he no objection, I will ask to have the mem-
oiandum lead.
There being no objection, the Cleik read as fol-
lows:

Mr. COX. I believe that the < fiect of this will
be to create a great monster national institution
it) iNew Yoik, with branches all over the country.
[Here the hammer fell.]
iVJr. COX withdrew his amendment to the
amendment.
The question rccurrcd on Mr. Hooper's
amendment, and it was agreed to.
Mr. WARD. 1 move the following as a sepa-
rate section to come in before the last in the printed
hill, whu-.ii las! section is, 1 believe, meicly a re-
pealing section:
Any State bank piopo<ing to organize under this act m
manner herein piowded shall withdraw it< State calcula-
tion befotc such otgimzation shall he completed and em-
poweied to transact its business under the ptovi'-jonsheiein.
Mr. WARD, (his time being extended by
unanimous consent.) Throughout ail paits of
the country there is a deeply seated apprehension
that unless the undue expansion ofourpapercur-
reney be immediately chocked the people will be
burdened with debt and taxation exceeding in
magnitude those of Great Britain contracted dur-
ing a century of foreign warfare or inflicted by a
Government which we have been accustomed to
regard as extortionate and oppressive, i have
already had occasion to express the belief that
the issue of mere promises to pay, called paper
money, instead of adopting prompt, vigorous,
and adequate measures of taxation, has fumi the
first been no less injurious to the pecuniary inter-
ests of the nation than to a just appieciation of
the political crisisand revolution in which we aie
involved. 1 hate never shrunk ftom voting all
such supplies as the Government considered ne-
cessity to overcome the rebellion, yet I have al-
ways desired that while the citizensof theUnited
States are growing pooier and poorer every day
as long as the war continues, they should be de-
luded by no fictitious appearance of prosperity,
but those truths which they are sure to learn at
last should be biought practically home to their
minds and pockets from the beginning. Under
such a system of taxation as I have advocated
greater economy would have been practiced, our
securities would have commanded in a greater
degree the confidence of capita!:sU and thepcople,
our national councils would have been more de-
hbeiative, and we should have been stronger in
the end,
I had hoped there would be no division of opin-
ion among us as to the inexpediency of contin-
uing to increase the volume of such a curren-
cy, and yet its amount is but little understood by
the country. Unul lately we have labored under
chronic difficulties in the want of piccise inform-
ation as to our financial condition. During the
last month one of my colleagues [Mr. Stebbjns]
stated that the amount of the circulating medium
was $400,000,000, and quoted the opinion of the
Secretary of the Treasury that this was amply
sufficient, that it could not he increased except at
the hazard of swift destruction to the whole sys-
tem, and that no increase ouglft'to be considcied
for a moment; while another, [Mr. Fenton,] in
the same debate, and in support of the same en-
actment, computed the governmental currency as
being $608,600,268, and still another colleague
[Mr. Brooks] says the currency issued March
15, 1864, stands thus:
Temporary loan     $47,207,545
United States Treasury notes  449,073,616
Fractional currency  19,173,3*20
interest-bearing Treasuiy notes   130,131,441
$645,585.92-2
Add certificates of indebtedness  I34.09tf,000
$779,683,922
On referring to the report of the Secretary of
the Tieasury it appears that, including the vari-
ous notes and certificates of indebtedness issued
on behalf of the Govei nment, the amount of this
ciiculation outstanding on the 30th of September,
1863, was $720,073,028. I include these certifi-
cates in myestimate, because they aie practically
substitutes for legal tender, held on deposit or in
private hands, and hence have the same effect in
producing an inflation, of the currency as if they
were ordinary notes, and are entirely distinct
from permanent loans. A fui ther amount of $104,-
934,102 was only lent temporarily, and was due
upon ten days' notice. Thus we had at that time
floating evidences of debt, make-slutt expedients
to avoid taxation, m all no less than $825,007,-
730, incuned since 22d of June, 1860, and before
September 30, 1863. The peimanent loans ef-
fected during the same time were less than five
hundred million dollars, ($494,963,500*,) less than
the liabilities left unpaid and to mature eai ly by
more than three hundred million dollars—consid-
erably more than sixty per cent.
According to an official statement published
more recently the amount of Government notes
and fractional euneney in otic,ulation on the 15th
instant was $598,571,636. Including one and two
year notes and certificates of indebtedness this
paper money was $824,796,576, while the whole
then due by the United States, including a lar^e,
sum in three-year notes, was $1,580,201,744, so
that on this statement far less than one halfof the
money already spent is permanently funded.
During the forty-two days ending on the 15th
March, the issues of one and two-year notes aver-
aged $2,000,000 every day. Between the 2d of
February and the 15th of iVlarch $80,000,000 were
added to the amount previously afloat, showing
alike the difficulty experienced in selling the se-
curities of the Government or funding its debt,
and one of the reasons why gold continues to rise
in spite of legislation intended to ariest it.
The amountof paper money thus in circulation
in the loyal States alone is $992,369,376, exclu-
sive of the $300,000,000 proposed by tin1 banks to
be created under the new national system. The
practical lesult will, I feat, be alike, wht ther the
actual amount of currency shall be $1,300,000,000
or much less. We aie increasing it day by day,
adding more to it than we raise by taxation or
are able to borrow for such a term of years as we
shall inewtably require. 9
The hill under review, considered by itself
alone, will stimulate thespiutof speculation to
an extent not only without precedent m this coun-
try, but so great that it is hardly possible ade-
quately to real'ze its effects. It appeals from the
last i e port on t he cond it ion of the finances that on
the 1st day of January, 1863,
The capital of the banks ('-leluuve of the ten southern and
southwestern States)   ,.. .$29/.'(91.630
Tneir eneulation was  Io^.f>.2,bl0
Loans and discounts  5J7.G37,0l\>
£973.0(11,45*2
While this law authorizes the issue of $300,-
000,000 in cuirency, three times that amount,or
not less than $900,000,000, may be added to the
banking capital of the country; and this direction
of money is encouraged by exemption from tax-
ation. Capital invested m agi iculture, manufac-
tures, or commerce, pursuits directly productive
and giving employment to the mdusm&l masses
of the people, may be in various ways subjected
to burdens for the support of Government in ad-
dition to the income derived from it. Under the
proposed system banking capital would be in-
creased from $297,791,630 to $1,197,791,630; tile
circulation from $167,572,810 to $467,572,810;
and as the average of loans and discounts by the
banks is nearly seventy per cent, more than the
capital, theamount of these would be $1,500,000,-
000 in addition to $507,637,012 already existing;
in all, $2,007,637,012 of loans and discounts. I
have no intention to exaggerate, but simply to
point out the probable disastrous consequence of
the measure under consideration. If 1 am in
error as to the amount of new capital that can be
created under this act and which must be em-
ployed to be profitable, I desire to be corrected.
It is a scheme without a parallel. The United
States Bank with its capital of $30,000,000 sinks
into insignificance. In some remarks upon this
bill my colleague [Mr. Kernan] said:
u CJuder this law all the wealth of the country, all tlie
personal piopeity can be put into the banks to the amount
of £900,000.000—if f am wronsj ihe gentleman from Massa-
chusetts will coirect me—because the only limitation of
this act is that there shall he but .$300,000,000 of currency,
and foi tiiat currency there must be deposited United States
s-tock. But no bank is icqulred to put up stock beyond
ihufv-three and one-third per cent, of it* capita). Then
we may organize a bank ot $300,000, and we need put up
but $100,000 of United States stock, but we may pay in
and use foi banking purposes $200,000 more.
"Mr. Hooper, i think the gentleman nariow? tlie limit
too much. The only limit to the amount of the bank capi-
tal ^ the amount of the; public debt, and there may be
capital oftluee utaes the amount of the debt of the United
States.1'
The public debt now exceeds $1,500,000,000;
therefore,According to the views of the honorable
member having charge of this bill, [Mr. Hoover,]
the capital may be not only the amount of the
present and any future debt, but may be extended
tinoe times the amount thereof. It is a scheme
that must inflict permanent injury upon the future
of the country.
We have not, even of late years, been without
practical knowledge as to the effects of financial
experiments like those now proposed, although
on a scaleof lessenoimity. The currency of the
whole nation never before, except in 1857, when
the ten southern and southwestern States were
with us and the country was a unit, reached
$214,778,822. The expansion of that year, then
deemed so gieat, bu 11 eally so insignificant in com-
parison with the enormous sums now familiar to
us by name but difficult for us to appreciate in their
reality, was followed by a collapse, during winch
individual failures occurred amounting to nearly
three hundred million dollais;and itis believed that
a depreciation ensued of no less than $500,000,000
in railroad stocks or securities. Results of tins
kind are not exceptions to the rule, but the nat-
ural and inevitable consequences of the financial
system now in practice. It is common to admit
the truths I have stated. Few will attempt to
deny them. The observance of these imperative
laws us essential to the safety of the commercial,
social, and political body, but in the blind eager-
ness of pai tisan warfai e they are as little regaided
as if they were long-foigotten errors.
The amendment was disagreed to.
Mr. BLAINE. I move to amend by inserting
the following as an additional section:
JInd be it further enacted, That the rate of seven per
cent, interest, hied in section timty, shall be deemed
lawful in all .States wheie no late h established, but each
bank shall be bound by the riute law regulating interestm
the ^tate wiicte it is located.
Mr. Chairman, this umendmenthas been voted
on and defeated in this committee before, and it
is now introduced again for the reason that when
. it was before the committee in two different forms
| the objection was made that it would destroy the
, uniformity of the bill. That issue was very clearly
i presented by the gentleman from Iowa and the
j gentleman fiom Massachusetts. Since that time,
1 however, by the action of the committee, theuni-
! formity of the bill lias been dreadfully interfered
! with, and I am constrained to believe that as
| they have given way m two most important par*
: ticulars, they will also give way in this. Every
! single motion that has been made on this side of
j the House or that side of the House to make our
i national currency a uniform currency by estab-
j hshmg some central point of redemption has been
t voted down.
I The uniformity of the bill has also been inter-
fered with, on motion of the gentleman who re-
ported the bill and under whose care it is, by the
