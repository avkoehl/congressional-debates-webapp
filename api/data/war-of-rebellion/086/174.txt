Have a gun-boat sept up Little Bayou Pigeon with 150 infantry as far as Micheltre's place as soon as possible to cut off Whitaker's party of guerrillas who made a raid on the La Fourche last night. Give them eighty rounds of ammunition and five days' rations, so that they can wait and fight them. My two good scouts will be upon the train to go on the boat.
