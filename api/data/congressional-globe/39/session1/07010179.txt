APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
179,
39th Cojst<j....1st Sess.
New York Contested Election-—Mr. Ifarshall.
Ho. OP'itEPS.
ANOTHER CONTRAST.
Vote of 1864. Nexo revised registry, 1865.
7th (Dem.) district 389 .367
12th (Rep.) district 493 337
*' Thus demonstrating that so far as we can judge by
analysis and comparison- of the poll of 1865 for State
officers, with the poll of 1864 for Congress, the seventh
(Dutch Hill) district was an honester and juster poll
tjjfcan the three Fifth avenue wealthy districts."
There is no direct charge that there was any
irregularity or fraud in the registry in this case.
There is, however, an attempt to prove that
illegal votes were cast; and to establish this
fact, there is introduced a witness the most ex-
traordinary, I think, that was ever examined
in any court upon earth. Mr. Speaker there
is probably no member of this House who does
not know that in any great metropolitan city,
like New York, a man who has command of
a large amount of money, ajid who is willing to
use it for the purpose of securing office, can find
scoundrels who will testify to anything. I do
not charge that there is any evidence that this
witness when he appeared upon the stand was
bribed; but taking all the circumstances, and
taking the testimony of the man himself, I say
that I have no doubt in my own mind that he
appeared upon the stand a bribed and perjured
witness, and that he testified with the fruits of
his perjury in his pocket. I do not, however,
charge that there is any proof that the con-
testant had knowledge of this. The evidence
shows that he had numerous friends who were
willing to expend money by the thousands to
secure his return from this district, and this
man Stephen Geoghegan was a proper subject
for any one who was in search of a willing and
useful witness. A more infamous scoundrel,
according to his own showing, never appeared
to testify on any subject. In order that Stephen
Geoghegan may have justice done to him he
must be allowed to speak for himself. No one
else could do him complete and full justice.
And "none but himself can be his parallel.1'
I will ask the Clerk to read the pages I have
turned down. This is the evidence on which
the people of this district are to be disfran-
chised and turned out of the House without a
hearing or a voice.
The Clerk read, as follows:
