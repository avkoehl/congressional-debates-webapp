Mr. EVANS said that the Subject *s 'ish liad
been under consideration for so many da>s *sa£ so
ctifficul, and had given rise to so much   discussion
and such a diversity of opinion, that he approached
it with apprehension. He had even doubted the
propriety of ihe discussion, and ask d himself,
without being able to find a good answer, what
good was to be done.
AH agreed that some'bing should be done to re-
medy and rectify the present state cf things In
reference ta the report and bill before the Senate,
upon its call, there was a diversity of opinion.
There was an opinion en the other side, that either
nothing should be done, or that we should return
to the Independent Treasury, And for what pnr-
pose'! For the safe keeping of the public money'

Mr.   Evans no'" proposed to shew that ¡t was
the duty of the Government to foster the currency.
The objections to the plan before the Senate were,
that it was a great Government bank, that
it was dangerous to our liberty and our insti-
tutions. It was undoubtedly very desirable to
restrain and control Executive power over the
finances of th« Government. But the same objec-
tions were advanced in relation to any institution
over which the Government had control The same
arguments were made to the Pscal Coiporation and
the Fiscal Institution of the extra *es ion Go-
vernment money could be kept nowhere where
there was not Government control Power and
control must be held by the Government, as we
contended, not only over the funds of the Govern-
ment, but over ihe currency of the country in a
g«at measure Tne best mode of doing this was
in an mstitunon where the public and private inte-
rests were united Tn's was the best mode of con-
trolling the public finance. But if th's could not
be ¿one, the du'y was no less binding to do some-
thing All tha* could be said of a Bank, a Sub-
Treasury, or any coipoi alien, was that they were
human institutions, and capable of being pervert-
ed. In the Exchequer plan, the Board of Control
had be n condemned. What plan could we have
ou' a Board of ConTo!? Wood, and iron, and
screws could do nothing; somebody must control
all aH 'hese. We could guard, check, govern, as
best we might, but chance must do much We
must run risks in all human affairs We ifiust
confide-powers to men. If we did n t, we should
be likely to stand something longer than the Capi-
tol itself Every tt^ng human was liable to abuse,
but what then' Should we do nothing? Ojr Go-
vernment w<is founded on truct -ai a confidence.
lit charm was seit government, and it w 'ook this
scheme or any other, we must t >ke it w t'l a 1 ha-

It was sa d *o be a union of the purce and the
sword. This was raíne neore* cal t an practical.
It originally meant m England the power of taxa-
tion, m connection witn the power ot making war,
of ¿rms, a"d the like co-tnl in matters cf war.
The cbret ons in this country v ele ft the adoption
(f the Constitution, when ihe principle of raising
revenue was discussed. Tne Presilent here had
no power over the purse. Wbat he did must be
done by authon'y of Uw. So of the swor ¡ The
Pr°°ident had no power to dettere war, mat was
the power of Congress, and after war was declared
be was taén the commands'-m chief. There might
be an abuse of this po ler, as ¡heie was when the
Treasury wa" cintro 'ed ill ga!!}, unjustifiably.
Tais, we argoed then, and believe now, was a con-
trol of the purse and the sword.
Power of «-one sort («aid Mr E) must exist.
We m gbt and bould cons der its liability to
aouse This v as proper, but it wa> not right to
argue against tHe ex stence of power, because of
it liability to abuse. He d d not think that this
abuse, though very great, was liable to «0 much
