3,887 knapsacks since the movement. Our total number of killed, wounded,and missing was over 4,900. As the knapsacks of these were also in most instances lost, a total of 8,787 is presented. But some 3,000 men have left the corps in regiments whose term has expired, for whom no requisition have been made, a portion of whom undoubtedly lost their knapsacks and clothing. The only approximation to the loss by abandonment is the number 3,887, given above, but no estimate can be made as to the proportion abandoned through indolence and the exigence of battle respectively. In the formation of storming columns the knapsacks were ordered to be dropped, and opportunity was not afterward presented for the recovery of all of them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. W. TOLLES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Chief Quartermaster Sixth Corps.

OFFICE CHIEF QUARTERMASTER ELEVENTH ARMY CORPS, May 24, 1863.

GENERAL: In answer to the inquiries in your telegram of the 23rd instant, I beg leave to make the following brief report:

The number of wagons which accompanied the marching column on the late march was, form camp to Kelly's Ford, 58 wagons, part of which were loaded with the knapsacks of the First Brigade, Second Division, then at Kelly's Ford.

The number of pack-mules as above was 197, of which number 146 were loaded with ammunition and 51 ridden by the pack-mule drivers.

Average weight to each wagon, 1,800 pounds; to each pack-mule, 220 pounds.

Ten days' subsistence carried in all; 60 rounds of ammunition carried by the wagons, 20 rounds by the pack-mules, and 60 rounds by the men.

Eight days' rations carried by the men; also extra clothing, one shirt, one pair drawers, on pair sock, and one blanket. About one half of the corps carried overcoats.

Average total weight carried by the men: Gun, 14 pounds; 60 rounds ammunition, 6 pounds; knapsack and haversack, with clothing and rations, 27 pounds; total, 47 pounds, including blanket and overcoat.

Clothing, &amp;c., thrown away: 1,824 caps, 3,602 trousers, 6,937 shirts, 2,638 blouses, 4,686 drawers, 2,560 wool blankets, 3,432 rubber blankets, 6,009 knapsacks, 3,242 haversacks, 2,271 canteens, 3,636 shoes, 252 boots, 13,123 stockings, 189 dress coats, 1,752 great-coats, 4,255 sheltertents.

"Are knapsacks an assistance on the march?" Yes. I know of nothing better than the knapsacks. The kind in use is, I think, very faulty, and should be remedied.

"Will men carry the knapsack and eight days' rations without unusual fatigue?" They will, if not loaded with other baggage, but should be practiced in drill with the knapsack every day, else the shoulders will be worn raw.

"Is the pack-mule system advantageous to the service?" Yes.

A supplemental report will be sent forward to-morrow. The time is too short to make a satisfactory report.

Very respectfully,

WM. G. LE DUC,

Lieutenant-Colonel, and Chief Quartermaster Eleventh Corps

Brigadier General R. INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster Army of the Potomac.
