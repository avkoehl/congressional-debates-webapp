no time to appoint cletU wlien a retrenchment in our ex

he thought it could get along without one He was willing a? a
memberofthe committee, to attend to whatever part of the la
hors was assigned him If it was neressaiy to have informa
tion fiom the Departments it could be piocnred much bettei,
and more conect, by communication with the Departments,
than through a clerk He hoped the appointment of a clerk

ahea<!y <sn iu,(y t eha ei on villous occasions Indeed, he was
satisfied the«e telatKi^hadornvel at a gtaeewheie some de-
gree of reserve was peculiarly proper in speaking of
them on this floor He did not consider it advisable
or necessary to say any thing on these topics He would
confine himself, and, indeed, he could wish the discus-
sion was confined to the aliimpoitant topic of sustain-
ing the Government, and reinstating its credit Jle
knew well that every member of the Senate had that
object first at heart, and that the only difference be-
tween them was as to the means of accomplishing it
He was willing to admit hi  own convictiors irankly He was
satisfied that the adoption of the amendment proposed by the
Senator from Mississippi [Mr Walker,] was vitally andinti-
mately connected with the bestintere^ts of the country, and the
preservation of the honor, chaiacter, and integrity of the Go-
vernment Under these circumstances, he felt himself called
upon to gtve it his heauy and energetic concunence, he would
consider himse'f wholly inexcusable, if he dil n< t He was
awaie that the Senator from Indiana, [Mr Smith ] who had
made a very able argument on the subject of the land fund, aa
he always does on any topic he oiscusses, and other esteemed
fuends with whom he geneialiy «ncuried, considered this
thing of a specific jiledsre all moonshine The honorable
Senator irom Maine, the chairman of the Committee
on Tmapce, seems to think that to expect any
pledge at all, is an imnutVion on the honor and integrity
of the country But Governments are like individuals in many
msunces, and, although unlimited confidence might be justly
p'aced m the honor and integrity of an individual, m the com-
mon occurrences of life, nobody would doub' the propriety and
prudence of looking to his means of ttpayn ent, as well as to
nn character, in lending him money So capitalists on being
asked for this loan, will look to the means of the Government,
as well as to its character lor punctuality and integrity They
will mqune in tube meat s ir In-, of redeeming i s promises,
dnector in plied of good fai band repayment Hence the lm
poitance is nanifest of navmg an abundant revenue to exhibit
its  ability to    meet   all   its   eigajremen        The confidence
of the caj itabsts wi'l be m propoition to the abun
dance of revenue with which the Government is en-
abled to meet its demands If there was no o'her advantage
to flow from the res oration of tl e land fend, would it not have
the effect of enlarging theabihty of the G >vernment to redeem
its promises and sustain i   good faith with those capitalists^,
Anclhow mucu lnoiesati&factoiy would r be to tho^e capita
liste, if the Gove nment was empowered to make tl em the spe-
cific pledge of the proceeds of the publ c domain, as a distinct
and intio'able fund for the security of bo'h principal aad in
tci e*t
Now with resraid to the doctrine maintained by the Senator
from Indiana and toe chairman of the Committee on Finance,
that England haJ abandoned hei system of specific pledges, and
thctt this Governrm nt hail n< tei acted upon that pnnciple, he
had a few remarks to make He believed a elose review of
t ie fininc al h sftiry of Great Bi tain duiing the last and pre
stnt centuiy would shew that it Wds the departuie from tha*
system by profligate and e\travagmt administrations, which
