in the inland of Great Britain. Notwithstanding
the exaction and the payment of that oppre sive
tribute, tbc Jews, in the reig  oí the same Edward,
to the number of upwards of fifteen ¡hoasand, were
banished the realm, and were never permitted to
return uatil Oliver Cromwell admitted them
The tragedy attending their banishment was a
disgraceful stain upon the reign in wh ch it was
ordered, a brutal violence, uawouhy of any age,
and a black and damning spot on England's cha-
racter, which time can neverefface
On their banishment, tne richest of them, having
put themselves, with their treasure, in a ship of
large burden, when the ship wai unoxr sail, and
gat down the Thames towards the mouth ot the
river, and below Juinsborough, the master of the
ship confederating and conspiring with the man
ners, invented a stratagem to destroy them The
master commanded anchor to be cast, which vps
done, and the ship kept riding at anchor until at the
ebb of the sea, she laid on the sand. The master
and his criminal confederates enured the Jews to
walk with them on the sand for their hraHh and
recreation, which they did When the master had
understood the tide had risen, he and h s associates
stole away from them, pnd got back to the ship
Tne Jews made no hasle, for they were not <?e, «¡i-
ble of their danger, nor the plot which was iai 1
for their destruction. But when they perceived
the peril they were in, they cried aloud for help.
Th.8 master, m taunt and provocation, answered
that now was the time to try the power and 'ruth of
their religion, they ought rather to crv to Mo es by
whose conduct their fathers passed through the R d
sea- m a short time they were swallowed up
and drowned.
It may be said that the exfravagant and oppres-
sive exac'ions made upon the Jews, taeir banish-
ment, and the tragedy which I have related was
mora the re^uit ot religious persecu'ion than the
exercise of civil power in England That might
have been the C3s<? to srme extent, but tV Church
and State were um'ed. The whole picecd^d
from the principle and spirit which wuild pro-
scribe fore gners fiom the tnjo>ment of political
rights in this country. I beneve that 'egal and
constitutional disqualifications m all the States or
kingdom* of Europe exist against the admixtión
of foreigners to the enjoyment of political, and, to
some extent, to legal rights I am not prepared to N«y
but but what that may be necessary to a c-rtain ex-
tent, owing to the conns luy of one kingdom
to another, and to the tacdi'y with which trea
sonable plots may be conducted throush the
medium of speedy intercourse, and the r?-
pidity with which they may overspread a
whole kingdom No such reasons exist with u ,
our remote distance from all powers, the wide
spread of our country and Government, to say no-
thing of the independence of our several S'ate Go
vernments, which are cheeks on each other, and the
whole a check upon the Federal Government, must
ever prevent any individual influence from foreign-
ers dangerous to ihe stability oí our Government.
The attempt ¡s hardly possible, 01, it ever made,
w II be nugatory. If, in. Europe, a cuizen moves
from one S'ate to another, he moves but from one
land of oppression to another, and the only object
he could have to engage m a treasonable plot, or
conspiracy, would be to restore liberty, but when
he comes to our country, he gams the object wh ch
in Europe might incite him to treason.
I repeat, that the restraints thrown around the
elective franchise to deprive foreigners of tnc right
of citizenship, .md the efforts row mailing by ihe
Federalists and the "Native American Associa-
tions," are dircc'ed against ihe German and Irish
emigrants who seek a home wnh us. Such is the
secret understanding and the open dectarat on,
when declarations are mad© And here lstre ask,
what would induce a German or an lu h
man to enter into a conspiracy to over-
throw a Government of free institutions, to
which he has fled for safely and protection?
What would induce either to enter mto a secret
negotiation with the Government from which he
has fled because of its granny, oppression, and
despotism? Sir, the thing is impossible, and not
more impossible than fruitless, if attempted.   But
when was the tune, or where the place, or whit
the emergency, that the Germans and the Irish have
not shown themselves worthy of the rights of Ame-
rican citizens'* When have they not, in Hire of
peace, done all that has been required of them in
support of the Government? When has been the
occasion they have not been foremost in danger
and peril when called on by their countr}1 In
peace they are the most industrious, hardy, honest,
and virtuous citizens we have, take them as a body.
Firm to their adopted country, and faithful to her
free institutions, as they periled a tempestuous
ocean, and encountered the afflictions of a separa-
tion from a native ho*ne, and ih" graves of iheir
fathers, for a strange lard, in sea*ch of freedom
so have they evpr manifested a ready wilbrgnessto
spill their blocd, and risk their lives, in delence of
that freedom which they have found here. Can
you point to the standard of liberty which the
Germans and the Irish have not mmf led their blood
to e'ect'
Sir, if it i> urged as a reason by the Federalists
and the Native American Association"!, that the
stability of our free institutions require that the
Germans and the in h should be disfianehised, I
could rpfer th"Oi lo orae ethe1- cla ses of our fo-
reign popula'icn, fiom whom there r much more
danger t« be ai prehendel I could riso refer them
'o some oihT influence-., subjection--, pnd connrc
ti ns, still more danjerous to the liberties of this
people and 'he tree m 'ilutions of this r mntry I
mean the ironeyed influence of a Bri i-h austo-
crncy, to whith we are now unf rtunately con-
nected, and by which we are suhjeeled to the pay-
ment of an interest on about two huadied mi lion
of dollars, called Sta e aebts, and abou ihuiy
or forty millions of Bn'ish b?ok cipital This is
an unhappy and ?n unfortuipte connection, bj
c?u>e it ¡s an oppres ive tax and a dram upon ihe

who mtms'er the holy sacraments, ha/e pros-
trated themselves from fhit high and l !'j <-'itioa
to which none bjt Apos'ies, and ministers ordained
by Heaven's sanction, should presn-ne to ascend
—even some of them, I say, by that influence, have
prostrated themselves, ai the shrine of British Emit
corruptions and political iniquity In place of
obeying the commands of their Divine Mastei, in
teaching tos way or salvat on to a d ymg world, they
have been ph} wg the poh'ical missionary' In place
of leaving w tness of the truth of his holy religion,
they have been endor mg all the base, fdl«e, and
infamous sjan 'er anl detraction wmch was pr mo-
gated to th° overthrow of this Admmis'rr'ion—sl?n
del and detraction wonhy of the distempered brain
of th" reckless, p"l ical, desperado, the heart of
cotrupti n and the tongue of poison.
I cheerfully recognise the r ght of every indivi-
dual in the community to ex rose the rights of a
freemin. But while I hold sacred the name  if
Christian T n s er snd "postle, I depm it a duty I
owe to the holy re'gion by which I hope f r ie-
demption and salvation m the a or Id to come, to de
nounce the man who v ill abuse it as unwor'hv to
be its profe s'onal advocate Yes, sir, some of ih-m
have «-ven been founl na-ticipa'ing w.tb, and
mmgUng in, tne ra crab'e, diunk n Fedcai orgies,
that would have disgraced a bachannalmn least n
the most degraded da> s of Greece Such men are
made for the tables of money changers, not for
casting out devils They may grace a gamhlsrS
board, but they would pollute a temple For the
honor of the holy rf ligion of our fathers, and the
sacred ramas cf minister and apostle, I hope there
were not many who so disgraced themselves, their
name, and the religion which ¡t is their profes-
sion to teach; but there were some. They will be
marked, and made the subject of moral and reli-
gious condemnation while they live, and wherever
they go But more of this some other time. Yes,
that is the influence our Government and our free
institutions have to fear. It is the influence of a
British monejed aristocracy, united with the worth-
less, penniless, Federal drones m our own country,
who I've upon the sweat and toil of those they
seek to disfranchise. That, I repeat, is the in-
fluence we have to fear It is an influence
which is now undermining our free institutions,
prostra'ing our Republican principle-, sapping the
foundations of our Government, subverting our
liberties and establishing among us a rotten bo-
rough British oank policy, overspreading our
country with ¡rresporsible corporations, and erect-
ing anfong us a rag baron aristocracy Sir, it is to
foster surh a policy and to perpetuate such influ-
ences, lhat the honest and faithful German and Irish-
man must be disfranchised and forever cut off from
toe ngntoof American citizens But,sir, independent
of th  obligations that the foreign blood which
wa* poured out in the Revolution brings us under to
admit foreigners to the rights of citizenship, there
is an m'nnsic value and worth in our German and
In-h pi pulatio , which entitle them to our confi-
dence and to ull political privileges Where aie
our public woiks, which we call the proud monu-
ments of our country's enterprise, which have not
been almost exclusively erected or constructed by
In-hand German toil? It is by their patience,
their sweat, and their industry, that our Union is
linked and bound by the indissoluble ties of turn-
pines, railroad", canals, arm oiher Slate and na-
tioml improvemer s But to the disgrace of our
conatiy, ?nd the dishonor of our national charac-
ter and reputation how oft^n have the patient la-
bor and the honest toil of 'he German and
'he Irishman met a reward in the filthy
arid worthless rag' of our swindling bank-
ing institution?, which could serve them no
purpose beyond the day's maintenance And
'et me here ackno wledge, that one object I
have in amending the naturalization laws, is to pro-
cure the who'e and the united lrflaence of our
German and Irish DemoTac  to assist m over-
throwing that miserable fraudulent, and corrupt
p iper system which rewards honest toil with the
rigged p om s " of bankrupt banks and rotten and
irrespons olecorporatiom. which hang upon tne pros-
pects of th s country, and the industry of every honest
man, like a milistone I desire to put it in the
power of eirery German and every Irishman to do
his part 10 overthrow i system cf policy and of in-
stitution 'iInch now enables swarms and herds Of
lazy, lounging, hungry Federal wolves to sap the
life blood of honest and industrious society—to
overthrow a system which enables the few to array
themselves more gaudily than So'om in, m all his
glsry, though they toil not, neither do they spin,
while the many are compelled to toil in sweat and
labw in dust, fro-n the time they en'er the stage of
human action until their exit, for a scanty mainte-
naiee. I seek to establish ami confirm the politi-
cal i ght  of our German and Irish population now
a id in all time to come, that we may have the be
nefit oí then political aid, to establish a system by
which they shall meet an honest and valuable re«
ward, m a sound currency, for their honest and va-
luable toil.
I need not sta'e a fact that is universally known,
and that is, that a largo majority of our Engl sh
popularon are opposed, an' always have been, to
the Dcmocr itic par'y (Tlvre are many worthy
excep ions The) e are mony who are an honor to
the Demooaicpj.rty I speak with reference to
those exceptions ) They have m all our political
s'ruggbs, b en found in the ranks of the Federal
partv, for re?<ons which they best understand, and
which are, no doubt, satisfactory to th-m. Their
eountn roen took a share m the Revolution. They
al-o took a share m the formation of our political
svstem It is tne benefit of our simple Republican
institutions which our English population have
sought, because, under them, liberty can be enjoy-
ed to more certam'v, ?"d 11 a gnater extent, man
ia the coamry which they have left.    Why they so
