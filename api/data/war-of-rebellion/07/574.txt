not throughout, and I hope you will see enough in it to give it a prompt trial.

The destruction of the bridges on the Cumberland and Tennessee alone is an object the importance of which cannot well be overrated, and is well worth the risk of losing more than one or two gunboats.

The present condition of the rivers I believe makes it practicable at this time. It requires no unusual preparation, and should be executed promptly.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, January 30, 1862.

Brigadier General D. C. BUELL, Louisville, Ky.:

BUELL.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, January 31, 1862.

Brigadier-General BUELL, Louisville, Ky.:

Movement already ordered to take and hold Fort Henry and cut railroad between Columbus and Dover. Force about 15,000; will be re-enforced as soon as possible. Will telegraph the day of investment or attack.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

LOUISVILLE, January 31, 1862.

General HALLECK:

Do you consider active co-operation essential to your success, because in that case it would be necessary for each to know what the other has to do?

It would be several days before I could seriously engage the enemy, and your operation ought not to fail.

The operation which was suggested in my letter yesterday would be an important preliminary to the next step.

D. C. BUELL,

Brigadier-General.
