are frequently six or eight hours old when received, and it is no uncommon occurrence to be twice compelled to repeat messages. I will put up another wire at once. It will require at least 5 additional locomotives and 100 cars to run to Decatur. Without that acquisition to our present rolling stock, it will be useless to open the road. Have seen Colonel Innes in reference to this matter, and have thoroughly examined whole subject.

Major General GORDON GRANGER,

Nashville:

The second wire has been ordered, and will be put up as soon as the materials can be had. The road to Decatur will not be used for the present. You will be supplied from this place. You had better repair the road at once, as arrangements have been made to procure a supply of cars from St. Louis besides those contracted for by Colonel Anderson, and the road will be run as soon as practicable.

General J. A. GARFIELD:

I sent my escort company and Mackey's company of mounted infantry to Weems's Springs, near Pine Wood Factory, at an early hour this morning and captured Dick McCann and 15 others, a fine lot of horses, arms,&amp;c. A force of 500 was encamped 8 miles from McCann's camp, and Clifford thought it prudent to retire. Clifford had about 90 or 100 men.
