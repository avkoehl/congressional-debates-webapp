HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 26, 1864. (Received 8.10 p. m.)

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

Terry's division is on my left, colored in center, and Carr's division, Eighteenth Corps, on my right. My strength I estimate at 9,000. Will make a more formal report and particular statement to-morrow.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,August 26, 1864. (Received 8.10 p. m.)

General WILLIAMS:

I have not yet succeeded in getting my corps over. I have only relieved Ames' division with 6,000 of my corps. I will have a brigade over to-night and expect Foster's (late Turner's) division to-morrow. The artillery is the same as to number of guns and position. Will send a field return when the exchange is perfected. Colonel Piper remains with me a few days as chief of artillery. My corps is probably 3,000 stronger than the Eighteenth.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

Respectfully,
