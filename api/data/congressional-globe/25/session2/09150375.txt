the public mind prejudice^ against the Administra-
tion In the bi'l under consideration, there is an
additional arpropru tton proposed on account of
the Chero^e" ireaty Now no one, I believe, is
ojipostd to tlii*- appiopnation, but it is made the
pretext for mil c mg upon the Admims*ration a
severe castigalion for some supposed improprieties
in relation 'o the execution of this treaty A mes
sage sent to the Senate and House oí Representa-
tives, afe v days ago, upon that subject furnishes
the main, peniaps the only, subject of complaint
Now, at. this subject had been introduced, he felt
bound to contribute his mite towards plac ng the
Administraren upon what he conceived to be the
proper ground, and the more so, as he might have
conduced, in some slight dtgree, to the present mis-
apprehension Lnt us inquire, then, m the first
place, what are the complaint against the Admi-
nistiation growing out of this message     They are,
First A desjgi to procrastinate the execution of
the treaty.
Secondly Holding out to the Cherokees false
hopes of proc-ist nation, and thereby producing
ruinous misch ers
Thirdly Ind "-ectly condemmrg the treaty, and
censuung those who voted for it
Now th  statement oí these charges, and the
proof of them, are two very different things, but
such is the fr->ihj of the human mind, that it is as
mu h prone, according to the circumstances in
which it may dp placed, to believe things without
proof, as to reject those which rest upon the
strongest testimon, But it surely behooves agrave
legislative bedy not to '■end forth, with the cur-
renc) wh ch its sinclion gives, imputations against
the Executiv e not on'y without being proven, but
when the w bo'e tes imony is directly the other way
Now, sn, said \h S I \enture tosav, in sending
the messag , (oí which I, among others, com-
plained, heann? it m the imperfect manner which
we alwajs do such thing  from the Clerk's desk,)
the Executive not only did nothing wrong, but
could not wI'll ¡ ipriety have acted t therwise, un-
der all the Ciicumstances This is tha opinion to
wh "h he had one after that deliberate perusal of
which, having t in a printed form, had afforded
him an oppoiui i y It is true a treaty was made
«ith tin- Ii dj ns in 1835, Tvh ch they were bound
to fulfil, and > which the Government might have
elforcedll', i Ttnt But in the very fact of
entering ni'o tit it> with them, we had treated the
Indians as a qua ! ndependent power, upon whom
we could not pet individual}, but collectively
If, then, th<.\ lul not choo«e to execute the treaty,
we had no ¡modi, cf enforcing it but by maki ig
war upon ¡h°m A high responsibility rests upon
every Governt ep< n its dealings with independent
powers, wh ch ln"ie is no e udmg Tne eves of the
world are uno i th m and there are two sets of
public opinions, asanst neithei of which can they
with safety or p opnety act Then acts must not
only be ba e 1 upon prmciplesof abstract justice,but
they must b- si "\. ¿s will be recognised as being
appl cable to lie larticular case by public opinion
at home, ind pi Mic opinion abroad. Now, sir, m
cur dealings as a nation vvilh the aboriginal tribes,
we are force t to k ok back upon the past history ol
our intercourse with them We must not forget
that the) weie me early possessors of every foot of
soil we now ocupy, and that m establishing their
possession, our ton.fath rs were forced to make
might the s* ir 1 •• 1 of right A change of circum-
stances has pa inced gieat changes in the conduct
of their successors, but a heavy debt to humanity
has been trarsm tted by them to us, which we can
nev er hope to pav, but it imposes upon us the obh
gation of mamt «ting in our dealing  with the In-
dians not oil' th most rigid justice, but the most
enlarged libenlm, rot onlv abstinence from un-
provoked outrv , but gieat forbearance under
even aggrav itcd w-ongs Such is public opinion,
both at home aid ahitad In this state of things,
a treaty has beei made with the Cheiokee Indi ins,
which, so far as I am informed and believe, is
quite as formal and obligatory as treaties with sava-
ges can UHial'y bt made, but yet its vahditv is
doubted !>} great i uml ers tf both nations, ard a
very laige portion of the weaker pover complains
that it has been overreached,  that if the treaty
must be enforced, humanity demands that they
shall be allowed more time in relinquishiag the
homes of their fathers, and that such additional pe-
cuniary provision should be made, as that, all pri-
vate claims being paid off, and the expense of re
moval discharged, the sum originally contemplated,
to wit, five millions of dollars, should be left to
them, to recommence their national existence in
their new home beyond the Mississippi. Under all
these circumstances, how did it behoove the Go-
vernment to treat these applications' Suppose the
Secretary at War had stopped his ears, and turned
his back upon their complaints, or, having listened
to them, suppose he had stoically to'd them, " here
is the bond— his is the treaty—it must be literally
fulfilled What is your distress to the people
of the United States'' You have made your bar-
gain, and you must abide by it Rum may over-
take you individually and collectively, but your
Great Father, as you have been wont to call
h m, cares not for it, it touches not the hearts of your
white brethren Literal executon of the treaty or ex-
termination is the alternative " What would have
been the verdict ofpubhcopimorii A tumultuous roar
of disapproval would have resounded through all
lands, and the welkin might well have rung wi'h
the shout of triumph which the Opposition would
have sent up." ' This weak, ruthless, tyrannical Go-
vernment, it would have ¡seen said, would have
been too cowardly to have made war upon the
strong, but see how it crushes the weak into the
dust1 Behold how needlessly the blood of our own
citizens has been shed, and the most civilized of the
savage tube* annihilated, that its purposes may be
accomplished1" A response, then, was necessary,
and that response must be dictated by kindness
and humanity, and it must meet distinctly the se-
veral suggestions of the suppliants The first is, as
to time And upon that point, the reply is, this
Government possesses no power to act We have
not the language of the suppliants betore us, but
there is no doubt they represent, in the most glow-
ing colors, the miseries impending orer them if
their flight must be sudden, and this picture was
presented m all the seeming sincerity of antici-
pated distress To such an appeal, how could a
feeling man return the cold response, "I have no
power to help you," without throwing in some word
of consolation, without pointing to the only re-
maining hope, however faint and distant it might
be' If, said the Secretary, you cannot remove
within less than two years, I know t'-e generous
hearts with whom }OU have to deal, and if the ru-
inous consequences which you depict are likely to
follow from an ear'ier removal, I know they will
relieve yen 'Vnd could not any citizen in this
country have ventured to give the same assurance?
might he not with confidence have said, There is
no State in this Union whieh will not suffer some
temporarj inconvenience to its citizens, rather than
thousands of fellow creatures khall be involved m
irremediable distress and Turn1 But the Secretary
believed mhis conscience, as eveiy other man who
knows any thing upon the subject believes, that
the story was an artful appeal, intended for effect,
and that there would be no necess.ty for this exer-
cise of liberality on the part of the States concern-
ed But he was not at liberty to say so A tale of
sorrow falls upon a benevolent rmnd,and whether
true oi false, its first effect is touching, and the an-
sw er is according, and it is left to experience and
reason to test its truth.
Upon the point of a further provision in money,
the answer of the Secretary finds an echo m every
bosom, and has met the concurrence of the appro-
priate committees m the two Houses of Congress
This branch of the subject must necessarily belaid
before Congress, and the question is, whether he
ought to have kept back from it w hat he had said m
r^laaon to removal' If he had done so, we can «ell
imagine, what chaigesoffiaud, cowardice, duplicity
would have been brought against him He did right
n laving the whole document before Congress, and
would have done v long had he suppressed any
part of it He gav e no assurance that time for re-
moval would be allowed, and disclaimed all au-
Ihouty to do so He promised to recommend fui-
tlier appropriation  of money he has made that
recomtnendat'on    It has received the sanction of
both committees and of one House of Congres ,
and will doubtless receive that of the oth«r.
But the Senator from South Carolina, -with a
warmth and indignation which seemed to him to be
entirely out of place, says this message is a con-
demnation of the treaty, and a censure upon those
who ratified it. No such condemnation or censure
could, he thought, be found any where but m the
imagination of the Senator himself. The message
proposes no annulment of the treaty; but, on the
contrary, insists upon its fulfilment, and for rea-
sons therein stated, proposes a donation of a far-
ther sum for the preservation of peace, and insur-
ing the fulfilment of the very treaty of which con-
demnation is imputed He regretted having dwelt
so long upon this topic, but having hastily miscon-
ceived the drift of the message, and having become
convinced of his error, this explanation was due.
But none of these things have aught to do with the
subject. All agree the further appropriation for the
Cherokees to be right. And wuh respect to tne appro-
priation for the Florida war, the matter was as simple
as could be, and it was masnly to disencumber the
subject of foreign and exciting matter , which had
been improperly complicated with it, that he bad
risen. Is any one here prepared to give up the
war, and surrender the peninsula of Florida to the
Indians and negroes now m possession of if! If
there be any one, he may, of course, (-insistently
vote against the appropriation. But tne, for one,
was not «o disposed. He would never consent to
see this Government Withdraw its protection from
any portion of its citizens Gentlemen had said
that Florida had cost much more to defend if than
it had to acquire it Be it so. There was a time
when the cry rang through this nition, " Millions
for defence—not a cent for tribute " He hoped
that would always be the cry; and he, for
one, would never consent to yield to force one foot
of our soil, though it might take millions to defend
it. The object of the appropriation, then, is legiti-
mate, is indispensable? Is the appropriation pro-
posed too large1 We raise committees in both
Houses upon the respective sabjects of legislation,
that they may gire to them their particular atten-
tion, and advise the whole body a* to ihe result of
their investigations. This subject has been under
the consideration of the Committee of Ways and
Means in the other House, and the Committee of
Finance in this, and the sum proposed has met
their approbation If gentlemen think themselves
more competent to decide, better informed upon
the subject, let them show themselves so, and it
will be well Let them show us by figures (for
they are bound to figure as well as v. e) that a ¡ess
sum will answer, and they will deserve well of their
countiy But no attempt is made to show the sum
too large, and he would feel himself safe in follow-
ing the guidance of the appropriate committees.
But gentlemen ask for a new datum. They ask
us to count the number of the Seminóles, and then,
I suppose, to ascertain how much it will take per
head to get rid of them, and thus find the proper
amount of appropriation " Hie labor, hoc opus
est " This is the very difficulty. Let the gentle-
men count the flight of birds passing above them.
To count the savages we must catch them, and it
caught, the necessity for counting would   be over
They tell us further, that the war has been more
expensive than it should have been, because at its
commencement u was considered a very trivial
affair, that the foe was contemptible and his con-
quest easy That is probably the very seciet oí
the difficulty Had we not underrated the strength
of our adversary, and put forth mere force at
once, we should probably have finished the war
much sooner. England committed a similar misiake
m her first assaults upon the e colonies, and both
England and ourselves were gu lty of a like fault
in the last war, and it gentlemen wish a prolonga-
tion of any war, they can adopt no plan more eflec
tual than stinting or delaying the supplies of
each successive year. It is reproachfully asked
why the system which brought one officer to public
examination, who did not terminate the war, has
not been followed up, and his successor brought o
examination also? Without going farther into the
subject, an answer may be found in. thf result of
that very examination    It resulted^ m the convw-
