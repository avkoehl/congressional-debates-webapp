that it was impossible to get Howard's corps over until after daylight. As Ewing's division moves from Trenton down the valley this morning, all in full view of the enemy, he will understand that he is to be attacked. As yet, however, there is no evidence that Bragg surmises where the precise point is that is to be assailed. There are to be only two attacking columns, the idea of a demonstration on Lookout Mountain having been abandoned. Sherman's column will consist of his own troops and part of Jeff. C. Davis' division, not over 20,000 men in all. The co-operating column from here, moving across Citico Creek, will be 18,000 men, under Granger. Howard's corps is posted north of the Tennessee, ready to cross at Sherman's bridges or at the bridge here, to support the one or the other column. A brigade and a half of Stanley's division comes from Shellmound and Bridgeport to take the place in Lookout Valley vacated by Howard, or possibly a brigade from this division may be added to Howard's reserve. Sherman's landing will be covered by eighty guns from the heights north of the Tennessee. The ground where he lands is bottom, a little more than 2 miles wide before reaching the ridge he is to seize and occupy. Bragg's total force here cannot exceed 50,000 men, and, judging from the great number of deserters, they are not as dangerous as formerly.

CHATTANOOGA, November 20, 1863-1.30 p.m.

The attacking force from within Thomas' lines is to consist of the three divisions of Wood, Sheridan, and Baird. The first two move directly across Citico Creek to join Sherman, if possible, while Baird makes a feint against the enemy's center, and covers the right flank of the moving column. That flank is also covered by the fire of twelve 20 and 30 pounder rifled guns in the forts on our left and center. Howard's corps is ordered to march immediately into Chattanooga, that he may be seen by the enemy and lead the latter to believe all the troops moving through Lookout Valley are coming here. Whether Howard's forces are needed to support Sherman's or Granger's column in the battle to-morrow, it appears that they can reach their destination more promptly by moving on this side of the river rather than on the north side. To move artillery, Granger borrows horses from Sherman, horses here being disabled.

CHATTANOOGA, November 20, 1863-2.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General Mitchell, just relieved from command of cavalry, Department of the Cumberland, is incapacitated by ill health, resulting from severe wounds, for field service. He will not ask for leave of absence, and desires duty as commander of some post. Thomas has no such command to give him, and would be glad if you could
