Total.................................................. 1,245

The fire from the enemy, which was progressing at the terminus of my last report, continued till about dark, when it ceased, with no further casualties on our side.

Owing to the change of garrison last night, I was prevented from opening fire on the enemy's working parties until about 3 o'clock this morning, which I continued till daylight with as good success as the night previous, though the enemy did considerable work (very near us) before I opened fire. He returned fire from his land batteries with Parrott guns and mortars until about 6 o'clock this morning, doing some damage to our bomb-proof, but accompanied with no casualties on our side. All damages have been repaired during the day, and the work is in better condition than yesterday.

This morning I observed large parties of the enemy working on a battery on their extreme left. I informed Colonel Rhett, commanding Fort Sumter, of the fact, asking him to inform Captain Mitchell. I ordered Captain Lesesne, commanding Battery Gregg, to open on them, which he did (after considerable delay for want of proper shell), with great accuracy, bursting several shells in their midst and dispersing them. My sharpshooters, under Lieutenant Dugger, Eighth North Carolina Regiment, do good work, though the Yankees are very shy and seldom ever show their heads.
