SURPLUS IN THE TREASURY, ETC.
Mr. GILMER introduced a bill to prevent the
accumulation of unnecessary surpluses in the
Treasury, and to equalize the grants of lands to
the several States; which was read a first and sec-
ond time.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I would inquire
of the Chair whether, under the resolution, bills
can come in as a matter of course ?
The SPEAKER. They are entitled to be in-
troduced, as a matter of course, where notice has
been previously given.
Mr. GILMER. Notice has been given ever
since the 9th of February.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I do not under-
stand that the gentleman can introduce, as a mat-
ter of course,, a bill of which previous notice has
been given. He merely gives notice, under the
rule, that he will ask leave to introduce a bill.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Ten-
nessee is right in that.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. And if there be
objection, it requires a vote of the House to give
that leave.
The SPEAKER. But a majority of the House
can give it.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Certainly, sir.
That I supposed. I am opposed to this bill in
any shape in which it can come up here.
Mr. GILMER. I merely want it referred to
the Committee on Public Lands.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. With all due re-
spect to the gentleman, I do not want it referred
anywhere. '
Mr. BILLING HURST. Has not the gentle-
man a right to introduce his bill under the resolu-
tion that was adopted â– 
Mr. GROW. Under the phraseology of the
resolution, do we not suspend this rule?
The resolution was again read.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I do notseewhy
objection does not apply to bills as well as to reso-
lutions.
Mr. GROW. According to the phraseology of
the resolution, the rule is suspended. It specifies
expressly that bills, of which previous notice has
been given, may be introduced for reference only.
The ^SPEAKER. The Chairis of opinion that
the adoption of the resolution supersedes the ne-
cessity of propounding the question to the House,
" Will the House allow the bill to be introduced?"
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I move that the
bill be rejected.
The SPEAKER. The order of the House pre-
vents that motion being made, because it provides
that bills shall be introduced for reference only.
Mr. GILMER. I only ask to have the bill
referred.
The SPEAKER. The Chair can entertain no
motion in reference to a biilvpresented, ^xcept, a
motion to refer; and that without debate.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Was the vote
adopting the resolution reconsidered?
The SPEAKER. The motion to reconsider
was laid on the table.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Then I move that
the House do now adjourn.
The motion was not agreed to.
The bill was referred to the Committee on Pub-
lic Lands.
ADMISSION OF KANSAS.
Mr. GILMER asked leave to introduce a bill
for the admission of Kansas into the Union.
Mr. GREENWOOD. Has previous notice
been given of that bill ?
Mr. GILMER. It has not; but I desire to in-
troduce it.
Mr. GREENWOOD. I object.
Mr. GILMER. I desire, then, to give notice
that I shall introduce the bill when it is in order.

of all correspondence touching the official character of the

ers ; also, a statement of thy amount of money appropri-
ated, and copies of the papers upon which said appropriation

FORT RIDGELY AND SOUTH PASS ROADS.
Mr. KEITT. At the request of the Delegate
from Minnesota, [Mr. Kingsbury,] I introduce a
bill making an appropriation for the completion of
the Fort Ridgeiy and South Pass wagon road.
The bill was read a first and second time.
Mr. KEITT. I move to refer it to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means.
Mr. LETCHER. I hope not. I move to re-
fer it to the Committee on Roads and Canals.
Mr. GROW. This is in continuation of an
appropriation originally made through the Com-
mittee on Territories. The Secretary of the In-
terior has regularly estimated for it, and the esti-
mates, I suppose, are before the Committee of
Ways and Means. I would suggest that for the
purpose of facilitating business ithad better go to
the Committee of Ways and Means.
Mr. COVODE. I understand that this appro-
priation is needed immediately for military pur-
poses. I move that it be referred to the Commit-
tee on Military Affairs.
Mr. GROW. I desire to ask the Delegate from
Minnesota what reference he wishes the bill to
take ?
Mr. KINGSBURY. I would prefer the Com-
mittee on Military Affairs rather than the Com-
mittee on Roads and Canals.
The bill was referred to the Committee on Mil-
itary Affairs.
GOVERNMENT BARRACKS 'AT SAVANNAH.
Mr. SEWARD presented a bill for the transfer
and cession of the Government barracks at Savan-
nah, Georgia, to the city of Savannah.
Mr. LETCHER. Has previous notice been
given of that bill ?
Mr. SEWARD. No, sir.
Mr. LETCHER. Then I object.
Mr. SEWARD. I move to suspend the rules.
The SPEAKER. The motion is not in order.
Mr. SEWARD. Well, sir, I beg leave to re-
port a bill from the Committee on Naval Affairs.
Mr. PHELPS. I object.
