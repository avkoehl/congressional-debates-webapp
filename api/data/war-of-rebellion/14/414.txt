Richmond, Va., April 1, 1862.

Honorable S. R. MALLORY,

Secretary of the Navy, C. S. A.:

SIR: I have just heard from General Huger that the obstruction contemplated in Elizabeth River, by lines of piles left open for our own vessels and to be closed by bonds or hulks prepared to be sunk as the enemy approach, has not yet been commenced. Deeming it essential to the safety of Norfolk, I must request that you will order the commandant of the yard to co-operate with General Huger in making the obstruction and to proceed with it as rapidly as possible.

Very respectfully,

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., April 1, 1862.

General HUGER,

Norfolk:

On my arrival here I saw the Secretary of the Navy, and he consented to furnish hulks or booms for floating gates to a line of obstructions. I supposed the orders had been issued to the commandant of the yard. I will see that it is done, and wish you to proceed immediately with the work, in conjunction with the commandant of the yard.

G. W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, April 2, 1862.

Captain S. S. LEE,

Commandant Navy-Yard, Norfolk:

Proceed at once to obstruct Elizabeth River. Call on General Huger for such aid and co-operation as may be necessary. Prepare hulks to shut passage when necessary.
