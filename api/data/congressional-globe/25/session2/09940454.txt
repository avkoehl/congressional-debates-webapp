would seem dimcud to ascertain how a question

i tins m torce    I niignt, indeed, adm t all that to
e true, which gentlemen say, a* to the raannei of
making this treaty, and yet defy them to show how
this House can avoid the obligations urder it, or
refuse io the States and the people concerned, the
vested rights they have acquired The States and
the people have yielded up certain powers to the
General Government, and obliged themselves to
submit to all obligations created by the exercise of
thee constitutional pow er  The States have no
intercourse, as such, with foreign states or Indian
tribes Can it be said, men, that when a solemn
titaty has been corstitutionally made, involving
them in ccrtamxluties, from which they cannot es-
cape, but must strictly observe, that the corres-
p< ndm<* rights thev have acquired shall not be re
sp c ed"! It seems to me that gentlemen overlook
the ma o questions involved in this inquiry They
forget thnt States, and citizens of those States, are
concerned in this matter It has been insisted that
this treaty ought to be abandoned by this Govern-
ment, and, further, that if any attempt should be
made by the States interested to protect their citi-
zens in the possession of the lands in the Cherokee
country, against the power of the United States, it
will be nullification Gentlemen have attempted
to draw a distinction between nullification in theo
ry, and nullification in practice, and call it practi
cal nullification to resist the power of this Govern-
ment, when attempted to be exercised m the case
supposed I, Mr Chairman, have always repu-
diated the doctrine of nullification, as / have un
derstood it 1 have considered myself, and have
been considered by all who have known my course,
a Union man, devotedly attached to the union of
the States, and ready to submit to the authority of
the General Government even m doubtful ques-
tions of constitutional power, yet, I must tell these
gentlemen and the country, that according to the
definition they have given of practical nullification,
I am a practical Nullifier For one, I am ready
to resist any attempt on the pait of this Govern-
ment to drive the citizens from the country ac-
quned from the Cherokees by a treaty, made ac-
cording to the provisions of the Constitution I
repeat, what has been often said, that we cannot
go beyond or behind the tieaty, to do so, would
lead to endle«s difficulties and uncertainties
The power of this Gov ernment to make the treaty
of 1803 with France, by which we acquired Louis-
iana and all the terntoiy then w est of the Missis-
sippi river, was doubted, the exercise of a similar
power now in relation to the propo ed annexation
of Teta*, is, by many gentlemen from a certain
quarter of this Union, positively denied—would it
be contended by any one, that m a question of
right, growing out of the treaty w ith France, (when
made m the courts or in Congress,) the constitu
tional power to make that treaty could be m-
auired into at this day 1 And yet, the objections
now made against the Cherokee treaty are of the
same character In a claim for land ansing under
the treaty with France or Spam, (by which much
of our territory was acquired ) brousht before Con-
gress for confirmation, as well might the question
be made, whether these treat es were constitution-
ally entered into, or wheftier fraud w?s not com-
mitted in tne nego lations, as to go into an in-
quiry now, in relation to the manner of making
the late treaty with the Cherokees, after it has re-
ceived all the sanctions requ led by the Const tu-
iion
Havim? as I conceive, shown that we cannot go
beyond the treaty, that it is, according to the Con-
sfitution, the supreme law of the land binding on
all parties, and absolute, so far as rights havg been
-•cquued under it, it would, ior all the purposes of
this inquiry, be needless to examine the other re-
maining propositions, but I promised next to consi
der the circumstances undei which this treaty was
made, ¡n order to set ihe suhject in a proper fcin
bed e the couutiy
The policy of the Government m removing fiom
the States all the Indian tribes within their limits
has been deprecated and denounced by gentlemen
who have addressed the committee m opposition to
(he appropnation, and the late President of the
United States has been charged w th having origi-
nated it, with a view ot gaming s'rength m th «a
States I do not consider it necessaiy, at this do\,
to inquire into the expediency of this measure    It

<hi not originate with General Jackson, for it ha4
been earnestly recommended by most of his prede-
cessors as being essential to the safety, and, indeed 
the very existence, of those tribes within the limits;
of the States, as well as to the interest of the States
themselves In urging this policy, General Jack-
son did no more than to repeat what had been re-
commended by others, but at a time when the pro-
priety of it had become much more manifest, he
told these Indian tribe  thatit was incompatible with
the rights of the States for them to continue within
their constit ttional limits, and pretend to set up an
independent form of Government, and that this
Government possessed no power to control the
States m extending their jurisdiction over thetn, if
they did so continue. He warned them of thecon-
sequences of refusing to avail themselves of the
liberal terms proposed by the United States to them,
if they would consent to remove from the States.
Before this, Georgia had already extended her juris-
diction over the Cherokees, and had enacted the
highly penal and sanguinary laws on that subject
which we have heard read during this debate. The
Indians complained of oppression, and, indeed, their
situation was such as to require immediate action,
or all traces of them as a nation were likely to be
blotted out.
Under (hese circumstances,astrongfeelingsprung
up m that nation among those who looked not to
their own private interests, but to the good of the na-
tion as such, in favor of concluding a treaty, as
the only means of rescuing their country from
the dangers by which it was threatened, and nego-
tiations were set on foot for that purpose according
Jy. Urged by the strongest necessity, delegates
were elected m 1834 by the Cherokee people, who
came on here to conclude a treaty. John Ross,
then one of the delegates, wi'h others, proposed to
treat , but insisted en term  so exorbitant,
(§20 000 000 ) that they were at once rejected by
the President He then addressed a communication
to the Secrptary of War, dated the 28th day of
Februaiy, 1835, in which he says that the Presi-
dent had before that, in conversation, expressed a
willingness to give for the country, as much as
the Senate w ould sanction, and expressed his desire
to make the submission to the Senate, composed,
as he well knew, of a considerable majority of his
(Ross's) political friends To this proposition,
the President acceded and in confenmly with it,
the question was submitted to the Senate, for the de-
cision of that body The Senate with a full un-
derstanding of the subject, having perfect know-
ledge of the value of the Cherokee country,
with strong feelings of partiality towards that
tribe, and especially tor John Ross, deter-
mined that five millions of dollars was the
full v alue of the country, and recommended a trea-
ty on that ba«is This was officially made knowa
to the delegation of which R/ss was the head, with
the most confident expectation tfeat a treaty would
be at once concluded, accordtos to the promise re-
ferred to, but, instead ot carrying out his agree-
meut, Ross commerced a studied course of diplo-
matic correspondence, replete with every evidence
of prevaricaron, until, finally, be refused to con-
summate a treatv, under the pretext that he and the
rest of ihe delegation had no power to do so, al-
though ne had, at the commencement of the nego-
tiation, ¡ep'esented that 'hey were invested with
foil authouty for that purpose He, however.pro-
nnsed to submit tne preposition to the Cherokee
! eopie, and use his influence to have it adopted.
This detei tu1 conduct on the pait of Ross, deter-
mine i ihe President not again to open negotiations
with him he e, but to subm t, through commission-
ers, the terms that had been settled upon, on the
basis ot the five millions, (and which had been
draw n up and signed by John Ridge and other dele-
eates thai in this citv, favorable to a treaty,) to
the Chercnees in their own country. Commission-
ers were appointed and sent mt« the country, who
commenced negotiations there, but, instead of «iert-
msr his influence to conclude a treaty as he had pro-
mised to do, Ross exhausted al! his powers to pre*
vent it, and at a meeting held for the purpose of
deliberating on this important subject, he caused
resoituious to be adopted that out off all hopes ttf
effecting a treaty, cmieav ored to destroy those who
