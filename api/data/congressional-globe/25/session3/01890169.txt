SLAVERY QUESTION
The lesolution i-ubmitted by Mi Monius, on
Wednesday, on the subject of sla\eiy, coming
up for consideration,
Mi   CLAY, of Alabama, demanacd the ques
tion of its consideiation
Mr NORVELL said it was very evident that
the consideration of this resolution would lead to
a long and interminable abolition discus&ion, and
every Senator must be convinced that this would
be productive of no good íesult Foi the pul-
póse, therefore, of getting rid of the resolution, '
he moved to lay the question of its consideration
on the table, and asked foi the yeas and navs on ,
the motion                                                                     I
Mr BUCHANAN requested the Senator from
Michigan to withdraw hii> motion for a moment
Mi  NORVELL assented
Mi   BUCHANAN said he should vote against u
the proposition to lay upon the table     From his
whole course on the subject of these abolition
petitions he supposed no person would suspect
him of being friendly to them oi to then objects,
but fair play is a jewel, and he thought that the
Senatoi from Ohio [Mr Morris] had a right to
be heaid, and to íeply to the íemarks that were
made in the Senate on this subject yesterday
That being done, he was willing to take any
course which might put the subject effectually at
rest
Mi HUBBARD said that there was no want of
" fair play" in the course proposed by the Sena-
tor fiom Michigan What is proposed > The
Senatoi fiom Ohio has submitted to the Senate a
lesolution upon the subject of domestic slavery
—a lesolution embracing subjects important in
their chaiactei, and if this resolution be now
taken up, in Ins opinion, it would inevitably lead
to debate TheSenator fiom Alabama íaisesthe
question of consideiation, and the Senator from
Michigan moves to lay that question on the table
The object is manifestly to avoid discussion at
this time, and this was, in Ins judgment, the
couise which ought to be pursued upon the res-
olution But the Senatoi fiom Ohio is not there-
by piecluded fiom offeiing Ins views upon the
subject of sh\eiy He can, if he pleases, m
imitation of the example set by the Senatoi from
Kentucky yesteiday, piesent hi!, views at large
on offering to the Senate a memorial on that sub-
ject This right he has, this puvilege he now
enjoys, if he chooses to exercise it, and he knew
of no rule of the Senate which could prevent him
or any Senator fiom going fully into the subject
of any memonal he might be called upon to pie
sent But he did hope that the lesolution offered
by the Senatoi from Ohio would not be taken up
for consideration If once before the Senate, it
would be debated, and such i debate could lead
to no piofitable result At this pcuod of the ses-
sion, he wasutteily opposed to bringing thaties-
olution I ciore the Senate, and lie ¡should, with
gie it j leasuie, vote m fxvoi of the motion of his
fiiend fiom Miehigtn
Mr MORRIS felt very much obliged to the
Senatoi fiom New Hampshne foi the mfoimation
that he had the same right as any other Senator
to express his opinions on subjects brought before
that body He supposed that he ought to return
him piofound thanks for this giacious privilege.
Mr M proceeded to comment on the course of
Senatoiswith much seventy, when he was called
to order by the President
Mr M wished to know in what he was out
of order, in the language he had used, or—-*-
The PRESIDENT said the motion made by
the Senatoi fiom Michigan was not a debatable
one, and therefoie all discussion on it was out of
order
The question was then taken on the motion to
lay the motion to consider on the table, (the yeas
and nays having been oidi led,) and decided in
the affirmative—yeas 22, nays ÍÜ, as follows
