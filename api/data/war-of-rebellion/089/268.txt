One gun drawn by twenty animals on Osborne turnpike toward our left; probably intended for the new work a little to the right and in front of Fort Harrison. The number of tents in his front is sensibly increased. On the line of breast-works between Fort Gilmer and New market road a fatigue party of negroes is, as yesterday, at work. Wagons busily employed in hauling timber to this line.
