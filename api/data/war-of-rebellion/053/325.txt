HEADQUARTERS ELEVENTH CORPS,October 12, 1863.

GENERAL: I just saw a young woman on the cars whom General Bragg permitted to pass through the lines. I didn't learn her name. Her house is about 10 miles nearer Atlanta than the battle-field of Chickamauga. She says the inhabitants are in a starving condition in her vicinity; that Bragg has great difficulty to get forage for his animals; that her brother-in-law was told he could soon pass to the North. Her impression at lease seemed fixed that General Bragg would fall back soon to Atlanta. She was apparently very friendly to the Union. General Longstreet was there a week ago; his men were foraging in her neighborhood. I give you the above for what it is worth.

Respectfully,

O. O. HOWARD,

Major-General.

P. S.-She met no force; but a single courier. Crossed the Lookout range, and came in at Bridgeport.
