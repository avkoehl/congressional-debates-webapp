" Washington, February 9,1870.

petitions and memorials.
Mr. ABBOTT. I present the petition of
certain soldiers of the second North Carolina
mounted infantry, asking that the act approved
March 26,1869, removing the charge of deser-
tion from certain soldiers of the second North
Carolina mounted infantry, be so amended as
to include their names. I move that the peti-
tion be referred to the Committee on Military
Affairs.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. WILSON. I present a resolution of the
Legislature of Massachusetts, relating to the
duties on foreign coal. I ask that it be read,
and printed.
The Chief Clerk read as follows :
Resolution relating to the duties on foreign coal.
Hetolved, That our Senators and Representatives
in Congress are requested to favor the repeal or
material reduction of the duties on foreign coal;
and that the Secretary of the Commonwealth for-
ward a copy of this resolution to each of them.
\V. S. ROBINSON,
Clerk of the House of Uepretenlalivet.
S. N. GIFFORD,
Clerk of the Senate.
The resolution was ordered to be printed.
Mr. HOWE presented twenty-three petitions
of citizens of Wisconsin, praying for the abo-
lition of the franking privilege; which were
ordered to lie on the table.
Mr. RAMSEY presented a petition of citi-
zens of Minnesota, praying for the abolition
of the franking privilege ; which was ordered
to lie on the table.
Mr. VICKERS presented a petition of citi-
zens of Maryland, praying for the abolition of
the franking privilege; which was ordered to
lie on the table.
Mr. SAULSBURY presented a petition of
citizens of Delaware, praying for the abolition
of the franking privilege ; which was ordered
to lie on the table.
Mr. ANTHONY presented a memorial of C.
B. Farnsworth and others, citizens of Rhode
Island, users of steam-engines and machinery,
remonstrating against the granting the petition
of George H. Corliss for the extension of his
letters-patent of March 10, 1849, for improve-
ments in the steam-engine; which was referred
to the Committee on Patents.
Mr. ANTHONY. I present the memorial
of Zachariah Allen, an eminent scientific and
practical mechanic of Rhode Island, who sets
forth that in the year 1832, having occasion to
prepare an address to a scientific association
upon the history of the invention and improve-
ment of the steam-engine, hisattention became
attracted to that as a subject of special study,
and that he had invented a new and useful im-
provement in the arrangement of the mechan-
ism for regulating and operating steam-engines,
which has now become adopted into general use
and been of great benefit to many people, but of
no profit to him; that in 1832 he took out let-
ters-patent, a espy of the specifications of which
accompanies the memorial, and he remon-
strates against the extension of the Corliss
patent on the ground that he himself was the
first and original inventor of that important
improvement. I should say, in justice to Mr.
Allen, and to prevent misapprehension, that
he comes with no claim for compensation or
reward. I move the reference of this memorial
to the Committee on Patents.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BOREMAN presented the petitions of
W. C. Timberlake, Richard G. Crank, B. R.
Eddins, Benjamin J. Darneille, N. M. Page,

Mr. RAMSEY. Some time since the Sen-

struction of custom-houses and buildings of
that character should be referred to the Com-

therefore ask that the Committee onPost Offices

Carolina, and that it be referred to the Com-
mittee on Public Buildings and Grounds.
It was so ordered.

the same committee, to whom was referred
the bill (H. R. No. 1096) to admit the State
of Mississippi to representation in the Con-
gress of the United States, to report it back
with an amendment.
In this connection I also report back Senate
bill No. 464, to admit the State of Mississippi
to representation in the Congress of the United
States, and Senate joint resolution No. 113,
declaring Mississippi entitled to representa-
tion in Congress, and a communication from
the President of the United States relating to
the State of Mississippi, and ask that those
bills be indefinitely postponed, as the subj ect-
matter is covered by the House bill.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Chand-
ler in the chair.) They will be considered as
indefinitely postponed if no objection be made.
