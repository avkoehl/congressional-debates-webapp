Confederate Government, which may now be refunded without offending her pride. The correspondence herewith submitted, marked G, discloses the bad faith of the Government at Washington and reveals the circumstances under which the instant reduction of Fort Sumter was rendered imperative. Next in importance to Fort Sumter the attention of the Government has been claimed by Fort Pickens. The command of the harbor of Pensacola was assigned at an early day to Brigadier Gen. Braxton Bragg, who still in charge of the operations against Fort Pickens. That skillful officer has been strengthening his works augmenting his ability for the reduction of this formidable stronghold, which was powerfully re-enforced by the Government at Washington in violation of the agreement between its authorities and those of the government of Florida, and renewed between General Bragg, in behalf of the Confederate States, and the U. S. officer in command at the post, as well as the officer in command of the U. S. fleet, as will appear from the correspondence hereto appended, marked H. +

The defenses of the mouths of the Mississippi have received that attention their importance demanded. The armaments of Forts Jackson and Saint Philip have been strengthened, and they have also been garrisoned by a force which is believed to be sufficient for the protection of the city of new Orleans. Fort Morgan, in Mobile Harbor, has been placed in an efficient condition. It is fully manned and possesses an ample armament. The command of Colonel Hardee, in charge of the fort, has been extended to Grant's Pass, and the supervision of all other approaches to the harbor of Mobile. The cutter Morgan, belonging to the Government, has been placed at his disposal, and he has been instructed to erect batteries at such points as he may deem necessary for perfect defense and security. Fort Pulaski, at the mouth of the Savannah River, has been quite recently transferred to this Government by the State of Georgia, but it now has an effective armament and is fully garrisoned, and is in command of Brigadier Gen. A. R. Lawton, of the provisional forces. Certain points on the Mississippi River in the State of Tennessee and Arkansas, although without the limits of the Confederacy, have assumed no little importance in connection with current events. Among these are Memphis and Helena, at each of which it is believed that batteries be erected that would effectually command the river. These places being within the territory of States entirely friendly to this Government, the Department had no hesitation in detailing an officer to make examinations, with the view of erecting such works as might be judged expedient to prevent a descent of the Mississippiforce from the North. Texas has exercised the solicitude of this Department to no inconsiderable extent Constant importunities have been received from the Governor and other prominent citizens of that State, urging upon this Government the care of the line of the Rio Grande, the coast line embracing the harbor of Galveston and her immense extent of Indian frontier. With a since with to afford the desired protection, Lieutenant Sayre, of the Confederate Navy, was dispatches to Texas in March last to muster into service a regiment of mounted riflemen, under command of Colonel Henry E. McCulloch, and since then an additional regiment of cavalry has been authorized. Both of these regiment will be assigned to duty along the Indian frontier. A regiment of infantry will occupy
