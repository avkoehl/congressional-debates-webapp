Major-General WEITZEL, Commanding Twenty-fifth Army Corps:

General Ord's orders from General Grant are that your troops must be south of Petersburg or southwest. He can not, therefore, give permission to locate on the James River. You can, however, go anywhere near the South Railroad between the Weldon and Danville railroads. My leave is granted. Good bye.
