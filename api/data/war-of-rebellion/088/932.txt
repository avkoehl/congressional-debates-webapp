HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,September 19, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I regret that I misunderstood the purport of your note.

I have and still consider any force in that position as rather mythical. I will, however, go down at once and look after them in person.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

AUGUST V. KAUTZ,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
