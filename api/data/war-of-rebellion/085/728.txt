I have ordered forward the cavalry to report to General Pleasonton, or if he has left to follow him up. I have ordered Mower forward to Jefferson City, where I will join him. Price has undoubtedly gone to Sedalia, and will not strike the Missouri River again. Send the boats to Jefferson City, and if I follow by land I will discharge them. I have just received a copy of Pleasonton's and Fisk's dispatch to you, dated 8th instant. I have ordered General Pike to Washington, to return to Saint Louis with his command. Please order transportation by rail to carry him down, one battery and about 2,500 men.
