NOTE.- The road just described was formerly the great stock and traveling route from Middle Tennessee to Chattanooga and south. The mountain passes were originally graded, and the roads called pikes, as gates were by law authorized to be kept on them, the toll from which reimbursed the parties making the improvements. In ordinary seasons this is a well-watered route, crossing in reasonable distances the Duck and Elk Rivers on west side, Sequatchie and Tennessee on southeast.
