* Tins county has been made since 1859, but its lands and lots are included 111 the above counties, out ot which it
was funned.
Sir, these counties of Western Virginia, knock-
nig for admission into the Union us a new State,
contain, m rich abundance, all the elements of a
great Commonwealth. Why have they remained
undeveloped in the oldest State in the American
Union? Why are our mines unworked ? Why
are our water-falls forever wasting away, unap- j
predated by the skill of man, chafing and foam- j
ingin their channels, as jf in conscious rage at the 1
long neglect? The answer to these questions is j
an irrefutable argument in favor of the division i
deshed. Unless the State is divided these natural
resources of wealth and power will foiever re-
main undeveloped. Is this just to the people there?
1& it just to the country at large ?
Thus, sir, we present our claims for this new
State. We pray you to grant your assent. It
will send a thrill of joy through three hundred
thousand hearts, and it will do no injustice to any.
Then, sir, will our invaluable virgin mines invite
the espousal of your surplus capital, and our pe-
rennial streams will lend their cxhaustless power
"to your manufacturing skill. Then shall we soon
be able to say, in the jubilant language of the
Psalmist: "The pastuiesaie clothed with flocks;
the valleys also aie cuvcred over with corn; they
shout for joy, they also sing." Virginia—East
Vnginia,restored from her temporary aberration;
West Virginia, like a newly discovered star—
East Virginia and West Virginia, twin stars, shall
thenceforth shine with ever-brightening luster in
the republican zodiac of States encircling our
western hemisphere.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The special order
of the day is now before the Senate.
Mr. SuMIStER. The Senator from Virginia
makes no motion in regard to the reference of this
memorial.
Mr. WILLEY I think it should go to a spe-
cial committee.
Mr. SUMNER. The Senator perhaps remehi-
bora that ill the case of Maine, which is the only
parallel case, there was a special committee, but
the lmbit of Congress has always been to refer all
applications for admission into the Union as States
to the Territorial Committee.
Mr. FESSENDEN. 1 call for the special order
of the day. 1 cannot wait for this discussion on
the question what committee this subject should
go to. I suppose gentlemen will make speeches
on that.
Mr. SUMNER. Iam merely making an ex-
planation as to the committee to which it should
g°- ■ ,
Mr. WILLEY. Well, sir, I move that it be
referred to a spuria! committee.
Mr. SUMNER. Under the circumstances, I
would rather that it should go to the standing: com-
mittee of this body; that is, the Territorial Com-
mittee.
Mr. WILLEY. Very well, sir.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will be leferred
to the Committee on Territories.
Mr. CAIiLILE subsequently moved that the
memorial, constitution, and accompanying papers
be printed; which was agreed to.
IlKPOKTS FROM A COMMITTEE.
Mr. COLLAMER, from the Committee on the
PostOffice and PostRoads, to whom was referred
the bill (H. R. No. 392) to establish certain post
roads, reported it without amendment.
He also, from the same committee, to whom was
referred the bill (H. R. No. 433) to secure the
speedy tianspoitation of the mails, reported it
adversely.
MESSAGE PROM THE IIOUSE.
A message from the House ot Representatives,
by Mi. Etuertdge, UsCleik, announced ihat the
House had passed a bill (No. 281) supplemental
to "An act slanting the right of way to tile btate
i of Missouri,'and a portion of the public lands to
, aid in the construction of certain lailroadsin saia
i State;" in which it requested the concurrence ot
■ the Senate. , TT
J The message further announced that the Uousc
! had passed the bill of the Senate (No. 292) for
I the collection of direct taxes in insui rectionary
districts within the United States, and for other
purposes, with amendments'; in which it requested -
the concurrence of the Senate.
DISTURNELLE'S BUTE BOOK. . -
Mr. FESSENDEN. I call for the special order.-
Mr. ANTHONY. If the Senatorfrom.Maine
will allow me, I wish to correct the reference of
a resolution that was erroneously referred yester-
day. The resolution to purchase copies of the
Blue Book was referred to the Committee ion Print-
ing. I move that that committee be discharged
from the further consideration of the resolution,
and that it be referred to the Committee on Con-
tingent Expenses, to which it belongs.
The motion was agreed to.
THE TAX BILL.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The bill (H. R.
No. 312) to provide internal revenue to support
the Government and pay interest oil the public
debt is before the Senate as in Committee of the
Whole. The question is on the amendment pro-
posed by the Senator from Missouri [Mr. Hen-
derson] to the amendment proposed by the Sen-
ator from Massachusetts, [Mr, Sumner.1
Mr. Henderson's amendment is to add to Mr.
SoMNElt's:
Jiml provided further, That the tax herein prescribed
shall not be levied or collected in any State where a sys-
tem ot'gindual emancipation may have been adopted at the
time ot the collection.
The question being taken by yeas and nays
resulted—yeas 15, nays 20; as follows:
YEAS—Messrs. Browning, Dixon, DooUttle, Grimes,
Hale, Hailan, Hanis, Ilowe, Lane ot Indiana, t'oineroy,
Slieim.in, Ten Eyck, Willcy, Wilson of Massachusetts,
and Wnglit.—15.
NAYS — Messrs. C'adile, Chandler, Chnk, Coilamer,
Cowan, Davis, Fessoiiden, Foster, Howard, Kennedy,
King, Lane ot Kansas, Moinlt, 1'owell, Kanlsbiuy, Sum-
ni'l,"'I'iuinbull, Wilkinson, and Wihnot—20.
So the amendment to the amendment was re-
jected; and the question recurred on the amend-
ment of Mr. Slmner, to insert as a new section,
before the provisions relative to stamp duties:
Sec Jind he it further enacted, That an annual tax of
five dollars shall lie |>:t!d hy cveiy pcit.011 oi persons, cor-
relation, or soci<uv, lot ami on account of the service or
labor ot eveiy otbet peison between the ages of ten and
sixty-five yeais, whose setvice or labor, lor aterin of yeais
or foi lite, is claimed to be owned by such first-ineiitionod
pewui or persons, corporation, or society, whether in a
fiduciaiy capacity, oi otherwise, under and by viitueof the
laws or customs ol'any State ; and said annual tax shall be
levied and collected ot the person oi |>( isons, eorpoiation,
or society, making such claim, and of then goods, chattels,
or land-J, a^ is heieinbetore piovuled; but in no ease shall
the per-iMi oi of:I-ore- who-e seiviee or labor is so claimed,
or their seiviee oi labor, be sold lor the pui pose of collect-
ing said tax. Provided, That this tax shall not apply to
service due to paierits.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I move to amend the
amendment by striking out " five" and. inserting
" two."
Mr. SUMNER. My first proposition was for
a tax on the claim of slave-masters at the rate of
ten dollars for each person whose service "Was
claimed. In this proposition I followed the Con-
stitution, which fixed the tax on the importation
of slaves at ten dollars. But Senators thought this
tax too high; and yielding especially to the sug-
gestions of the Senator fiom Virginia and the
Senator from Rhode Island, I consented to reduce
it to five dollais. Now, the Senator from Maine,
chairman of our Committee on Finance, proposes
another reduction to two dollars for each person.
This seems to me to be going too far, or l-ather
descending too low. .
The Senator from Maine said thathe looked sim-
ply at the revenue to be obtained by a tax. put,
pray, will not a larger revenue be obtained at the
rate of five dollars than at the rate of two ? There
are the slaves, count them and tax them. The pto-
cess is simple and there is no chance of evasion.
Besides, sir, 1 cannot forget, nor can the Senatoi,
that throughout our history we have heard con-
stantly of " incidental protection." But if inci-
dental protection is just and expedient, then is tre-
cidental discouragement, and the tax I now propose
maybe sustained on this ground. We do not
hesitate to tax whisky and tobacco as luxuries,
indulgences, vices. Why should we hesitate to
tax the worst luxury, the worst indulgence, and
worst vice of all, which is slavery? Therefore,
for a double reason; fust, for the sake of revenue,
and secondly, foi the sake of discouragement to
slavery, I am for the larger tax. I will not take
time to odd to what I have tdready said on the
