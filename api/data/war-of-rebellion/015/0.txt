The one building by Ollinger &amp;amp; Bruce had been in the water about ten days, and, with the exception of machinery, would have been ready for her guns in ten days; she would have carried one 10-inch and one rifled 32-pounder.

These gunboats [were] well, strongly, and thoroughly built, and for sails or steam, and would, in my opinion, have rendered important service in case of an attack by the enemy upon Pensacola. These vessels were being constructed about 35 miles from Fort Pickens, and in case of an attack upon Pensacola were in a condition to have been, and might have been, removed up the Escambia River, out of reach of the enemy's gunboats.

When I was at Pensacola I saw no unusual number of enemy's ships off the part, nor could I discover the necessity for the destruction of the gunboats.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EBEN FARRAND,

Commanding, C. S. Navy.

MOBILE, February 18, 1862.*

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN:

Yours of the 8th just received. Fifth Georgia, Ninth Mississippi, Twentieth and Twenty-third Alabama Regiments on way to Knoxville. Should we not give up the seaboard now and concentrate all our means on the vital point?

PUBLISHED PURSUANT TO ACT OF CONGRESS APPROVED JUNE 16 1880

WASHINGTON:

GOVERNMENT PRINTING OFFICE.

1885.

By an act approved June 23, 1874, Congress made an appropriation "to enable the Secretary of War to begin the publication of the Official Record of the War of the Rebellion, both of the Union and Confederate Armies," and directed him "to have copied for the Public Printer all reports, letters, telegrams, and general orders not heretofore copied or printed, and properly arranged in chronological order."

Appropriations for continuing such preparation have been made from time to time, and the act approved June 16, 1880, has provided "for the printing and binding, under direction of the Secretary of War, of 10,000 copies of a compilation of the Official Records (Union and Confederate) of the War of the Rebellion, so far as the same may be ready for publication, during the fiscal year"; and that "of said number, 7,000 copied shall be for the use of the House of Representatives, 2,000 copies for the use of the Senate, and 1,000 copies for the use of the Executive Departments."*

This compilation will be the first general publication of the military records of the war, and will embrace all official documents that can be abstained by the compiler, and that appear to be of any historical value.

*Volume I to V distributed under act approved June 16, 1880. The act approved August 7, 1882, provides that-

"The volumes of the official records of the war of the rebellion shall be distributed as follows: One thousand copied to the executive departments, as now provided by law. One thousand copies for distribution by the Secretary of War among officers of the Army and contributors to the work. Eight thousand three hundred copies shall be sent by the Secretary of War to such libraries, organizations, and individuals as may be designated by the Senators, Representatives, and Delegates of the Forty-seventh Congress. Each Senator shall designate not exceeding twenty-six, and each Representative and Delegate not exceeding twenty-one of such addresses, and the volumes shall be sent thereto from time to time as they are published,until the publication in completed. Senators, representatives, and Delegates shall inform the Secretary of War in each case how many volumes of those heretofore published they have forwarded to such addresses. The remaining copies of the eleven thousand to be published, and all sets that may not be ordered to be distributed as provided herein, shall be sold by the Secretary of War for cost of publication with ten percent. added thereto, and the proceeds of such sale shall be covered into the Treasurey. If two or more sats of said volumes are ordered to the same address the Secretary of War shall inform the Senators, Representatives or Delegates, who have designated the same, who thereupon may designate other libraries, organizations, or individuals. The Secretary of War shall report to the first session of the Forty-eighth congress what volumes of the series heretofore published have not been furnished to such libraries, organizations, and individuals. He shall also inform distributes at whose instance the volumes are sent."

The publication will present the records in the following order of arrangement:

The 1st Series will embrace the formal reports, both Union and Confederate, of the first seizures of United States property in the Southern States, and of all military operations in the field, with correspondence, orders, and returns relating specially thereto, and, as proposed is to be accompanied by an Atlas.

In this series the reports will be arranged according to the campaigns and several theaters of operations (in the chronological order of the events), and the Union reports of any event will, as a rule, be immediately followed by the Confederate accounts. The correspondence, &c., not embraced in the "reports" proper will follow (first Union and next Confederate) in chronological order.

The 2nd Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns, Union and Confederate, relating to prisoners of war, and (so far as the military authorities were concerned) to State or political prisoners.

The 3rd Series will contain the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Union authorities (embracing their correspondence with the Confederate officials) not relating specially to the subjects of the first and second series) not relating specially to the subjects of the first and second series. It will set forth the annual and special reports of the Secretary of War, of the General-in Chief, and of the chiefs of the several staff corps and departments; the calls for troops, and the correspondence between the National and the several State authorities.

The 4th Series will exhibit the correspondence, orders, reports, and returns of the Confederate authorities, similar to that indicated for the Union officials, as of the third series, but excluding the correspondence between the Union and confederate authorities given in that series.
