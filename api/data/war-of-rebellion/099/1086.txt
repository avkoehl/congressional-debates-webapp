Respectfully forwarded to the War Department for the information of the President.

If it be true, as reported by prisoners and deserters, that Schofieldd's corps (Twenty-third), from Middle Tennessee, and Sheridan's (Ninteenth), from the Valley of Virginia, have joined Sherman's army, it cannot be ectimated at less than 54,000 infantry and artillery-i. e., six corps at 9,000 men each, to whom must be added about 4,000 cavalry, froming a total of not less than 58,000 disciplined and well organized men.

Adjutant and Inspector General.

[Third indorsement.]

Read and returned. The previous reports justified the supposition that a larger force than that stated within was present for duty. The distinction made by the term "relied on as effectives" may account for the differance.

GENERAL: The Fourth Tennessee and Eight Texas, under Colonel Anderson, have just crossed at the bridge.
