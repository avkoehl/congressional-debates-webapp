It is reported that one of General Stoneman's brigades went into Powder Springs after my men left, and were driven out by the rebels.

SIR: I have the honor to report that a scouting party, sent out by me this morning, went seven and a half miles on the Dallas road without meeting any of the enemy. They have been reported in parties of two or three on the Powder Springs road, and the Marietta road leading from it. Lieutenant-Colonel Adams, commanding one of the brigades in General Stoneman's corps, was shelled out of his camp this afternoon, about two miles this side of Powder Springs. I sent down, and he had been re-enforced by infantry. I shall send part of my command down in the morning, unless something unforeseen occurs. Everything has been quiet on my picket-lines, and the frequent patrols made from them have met none of the enemy. I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that one of my scouting parties captured a captain of the Fourth Tennessee Cavalry and 2 men, this morning, about a mile this side of Powder Springs. From information received from prisoners, I learn that the rebel cavalry are in the habit of passing through Marietta, behind Kenesaw, to our left. It is this way, I suppose, they got their force along the railroad above Allatoona. These prisoners belong to a new organization to me-Harrison's brigade, Humes' division. They came in from right of rebel army two or three days since. Some of the enemy have shown themselves this morning on the Dallas road near my pickets. I am sending out to ascertain what the force is. Nothing else new.

Very respectfully,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
