HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,In the Field, July 4, 1863.

Major-General ROUSSEAU,

Commanding Second Division:

GENERAL: You are directed by the major-general commanding to select a suitable camp, and remain until further orders, as it has been announced from department headquarters that the pursuit is virtually ended. Send a detail of men in to repair the roads back to the Winchester and McMinnville road, or the road you passed over this morning, for the purpose of getting up supplies. It is probable we shall continue our march south as soon as we get our supplies replenished.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

[GEO. E. FLYNT,]

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS,Cowan, Tenn., July 4, 1863 - 7.50 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel G. P. THRUSTON,

Asst. Adjt. General and Chief of Staff, Twentieth Army Corps:

COLONEL: In reply to your communication of this date, I have the honor to state that I have already forwarded you a report of my reconnaissance to Mount Top this morning, which you have probably received by this time. I think the stand made at University was merely a temporary one, to cover their transportation, which would require considerable time to get down the mountain. The road to Mount Top is very bad. The character of the road from there to Tantalon I cannot learn anything about. The Lost Creek road, from Tantalon to University, is not laid down properly on the map, and it is doubtful if there is one at all. There is a road from Tantalon to Burnt Stand. Would it not be best to make another reconnaissance to-morrow? I thought of doing so, but will await your orders.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: Your communication of 7.50 p. m. to-day was received; also a previous one, reporting the capture of the cattle, which General McCook considers a very timely and satisfactory success. He agrees
