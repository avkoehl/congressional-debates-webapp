Colonel W. W. WRIGHT,

New Berne:

Keep you construction force at work here in North Carolina till I have official news of General Grant. If Richmond is taken, of which I have no doubt, we will not need the Norfolk road, but will at once work up to Raleigh and beyond. Hold your force ready for the extension to Raleigh from Goldsborough. Let repairs go on on both the New Berne and Wilmington branches.
