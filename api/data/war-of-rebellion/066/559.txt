CHARLESTON, S. C., July 5, 1864.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Via Royall's, James Island (Care General Taliaferro):

Have talked with the Yankee surgeon referred to by General Robertson. Am thoroughly convinced that the present movements in front of Charleston have been carefully planned, maturely weighed, and are not to be abandoned readily. The expedition, as this prisoners terms it, is regarded as one of great importance, and its success was confidently expected.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Royall's House, James Island:

General Jackson, with two regiments, is in Augusta, under orders for Savannah, which I at once countermanded, and ordered him here at once.

CHARLESTON, S. C., July 5, 1864.

Major General SAMUEL JONES,

Via Royall's, James Island, S. C., (Care of Brigadier-General Taliaferro):

Major Jenkins reports enemy advancing on Stono road in rear of Battery Pringle. Says that it is a demonstration in force. Dates his dispatch at 9 a. m. General Robertson says the enemy seem trying to get position on Stono to take James Island in reverse. Suggests that you man Battery Palmer until Rickenbaker's company can be sent for from Ashepoo Ferry. Ransone's heavy artillery at Adams's Run, ready to move when transportation is furnished. They can be placed in Battery Palmer. Robertson has sent all his infantry to John's Island. Ransone's heavy artillery at Adams' Run Station. Shall the infantry be ordered from John's Island? I repeat my conviction that these operations against Charleston have been carefully planned and that success is confidently anticipated by the enemy. Telegraph me your orders. McLaws has not heard of Hood's battalion.

CHAS. S. STRINGFELLOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
