Major General F. STEELE,

Kenner, La.:

The ocean steamer which is to take one of your brigades to Fort Morgan has capacity for some 700 more troops, and the commanding general directs that the Twenty-third Iowa and the Seventy-sixth Illinois, which are to be assigned to brigades now at Mobile, be forwarded by the same opportunity. As a rule, every foot of transportation must be made available. The Third Brigade under the new organization will consist of the Twenty-ninth Illinois, Thirtieth Missouri, One hundred and sixty-first New York, and Twenty-third Wisconsin; the latter not yet arrived from Arkansas. The first three regiments number about 1,600, and Colonel Sawtelle thinks he can have sea-going transportation ready for them by Sunday or Monday. Be pleased to hold them in readiness to embark the moment the steamers are ready.

By order:

C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
