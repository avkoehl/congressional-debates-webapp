HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS,February 28, 1865.

Major General FITZHUGH LEE, Commanding Cavalry, North Side:

Since General Bratton's brigade has been removed from the left of Field's line leaves a larger front to be covered by your cavalry. Upon any sign of an advance by the enemy you will promptly collect your command on the Nine-mile road and hold the works to the left of the infantry with your dismounted men. Endeavor to inform yourself as well as possible of the location of all the roads in front of you, and have all approaches by which the enemy can possibly penetrate our lines closely watched.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
