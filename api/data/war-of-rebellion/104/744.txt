MACON, May 13, 1865 - 11 a. m.

QUARTERMASTER-GENERAL:

General Molineux reports from Augusta only three feet six inches water in the Savannah River. I fear there will be great difficulty in supplying my command by that line, and would suggest, if we are to remain in Georgia, that the Chattanooga and Atlanta road be opened. I can put 3,000 men to work at once, and, with but a very slight expense for labor, can soon have the road in running order. Aside from military considerations, I know of nothing which would do more good in re-establishing the relations of Georgia with the loyal States than the reconstruction of this important line of communication.

Brevet Major-General.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL U. S. ARMY,

Washington, D. C.:

I have the honor to recommend and request the appointment of Colonel R. H. G. Minty as brigadier-general for gallant and distinguished services. Colonel Minty has before been recommended, and his services during the last campaign of the Cavalry Corps fully entitle him to promotion.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

Major General Q. A. GILLMORE,

Commanding Department of the South, Hilton Head or Savannah:

GENERAL: This will be handed you by Lieutenant-Colonel Pritchard, Fourth Michigan Cavalry, who is the captor of Jefferson Davis, and is now conducting him and other State prisoners to Washington. If the admiral commanding South Atlantic Squadron has at hand a swift light-draft man-of-war, it would be well to request him to place it at the disposal of Colonel Pritchard for the purpose of carrying his prisoners more safely and direct to Washington. Otherwise, please furnish a proper steamer with as little delay as possible to carry them to Fortress Monroe, where I have requested the Secretary of War to have a steamer in waiting.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

AUGUSTA, May 13, 1865.

Major-General WILSON:

Parties claiming the specie call upon me to deliver it up. Your order addressed to Cavalry Corps commanders simply states effects. As my provost-marshal has receipted for specie, will you send an order to cover me, stating specie, or had it not better be sent under guard to you, together with papers?

E. L. MOLINEUX,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
