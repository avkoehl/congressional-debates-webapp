sion u i .1 'hey snould have passed an appropria-
tion bill paying the army and navy, and oih*> 
branches of the public service, for labor actually
performed. He addressed the House for some
time, chiefly deprecating the course of the present
Congress m neglecting to pass any bill to pay the
officers and men in the army and navy, whilst they
had taken most sedulous care to provide for them-
selves He said that, as the appropriation for the
pay of the members expired on the 15ih in«tin't
when a new bill came up for that purpose, he
should ra¡se the question whether tbey ought to pay
themselves whilst they neglected other branches of
the public service. Though as poor in purse as
any, be should be willing to go home without
another dollar, ¡f the other departments of the
Government were not provided for.
Mr BARNARD opposed the second reading of
the bill, on the ground, as he said, that there was
not time enough to play out this game daring the
presf nt session.
Mr STANLY said he had voted to suspend the
rules, in order to receive the bill, nicely in cour-
tesy. He was, however, opposed to it, because he
believed no class of public servants were so poorly
paid as the membeisof Congress He would con-
sent that it should be referred to the Commit ee of
the Whole, chiefly on account of the numerous
petitions which had been sent here asking for a re-
el uctnn of the pay of members. He concluded by
moving the previous question on the second read-
ing of the bill.
Mr WISE moved to lay the bill on the table.
Mr GRANGER asked for ihe ysas and nay ,
which were ordered, and resulted—yeas 51, nays
107
Mr C H WILLIAMS then moved that the
House adjourn.   Carried—yeas 89, nays 39.
