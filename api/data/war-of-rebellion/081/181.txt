HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864-7 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

Another attack made by my right failed to take the enemy's line, but we advanced up quite close to the works, and hold all we got. We want to make another effort just at dark.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.

BURNSIDE'S HEADQUARTERS, June 18, 1864.

General WARREN:

Does the dispatch from General Meade change your plans for the night? If so, please let me know.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864.

General BURNSIDE:

I am afraid it is too late to change my plans, as orders are out. If we have any success I wish you to help us by a demonstration. Make a noise anyhow.

WARREN.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864.

We have everything all arranged and will try to rush on the left at 7.30 again, and would like you to make a demonstration about the same time. Can you do it to favor it?

WARREN.

HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, June 18, 1864.

Major General G. K. WARREN:

We will do everything in our power to assist you in the attack, but I am inclined to think that we will do more than I dare to promise you now. We will certainly attack at that hour.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 18, 1864-7.30 p.m.

Major-General WARREN:

It is useless to make another attack, because I doubt your or my ability to follow it up. Secure your lines and look to your left flank.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
