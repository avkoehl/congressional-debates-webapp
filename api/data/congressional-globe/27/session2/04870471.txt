and the small States by general ticket, the small States would
have too mudi powei These were inconsistent position*
One argument was, that they deprived the laige S ates of
power, andanother wa«, that they were giving them power by
this amendment He was willing to leave it to the ¡states them
selves
The gentleman from New Jersey [Mr Halsted] had argued
that there was no such thins as the geneial ticket <>ys em m
Gteat Britain lie (Mr A ) did not s p¡m e iheit, was ary thirg
so analogous in oui repiesenta'ion ro ü tí of Fnjrltnd as to af
ford an argument It Aou'd resemb e i he British svstem much
more than the American sys emioi th t> Government tofxercise
an extreme ultimate p< wet before the occasion friived i or it
If hewtntedlo make Congies  suri eme like the linns Par
Iiatnent, then there would be no need of resai dins State right*,
and. by adopting this amendment they would at once- appioxi
mate to what the gen tinman consideieJ aa a perfect model -the
system of the British G % eminent
The gentleman from New York had argued that there shOJld
be uniformity Ibeie coull not bt. What uniformity was
ntore desirable than tha the qua! ficatwns of elector  shoul i
be similar? and yet the General Government had no power to
alter these qualification  Ine inference to his mind was irre
sistible, that it \yas intended that the Slates should regulate iheir
elections according to their peculiar *eehngs and character and
reserve this power to be exercised by this Government oily m
extreme cases
How was it with t"ie first Oongieesheld after the adoption of
the Constitution1 The members from Penrsylvama in that
Congress were elected by general ticket Where was theuni
forrmty in Massachusetts, which elected part of her Represen
tativesby general ticket, and part by the district system? Some
two 01 thiee States m the first election after the adoption of
the Constitution chose by districts, butgenerally the Repiesen
tatives were elected by general ticket Where was th< uni
fortuity then? Suppose in 1792 or '93 a bill had been introduced
into this House commanding the States to elect by the general
district sjstem After all the debate i x which it was contended
that this power was never to he exercised except in case of ex
treme necessity, would it not have been considered abreachof
faith on the part of the General Government andan enoim
ous abuse of power? No emergency existed now for the e^er
else of this extreme and doubtful power
He had intended to say something further m repaid
to the mconzruity of this amcrdment in the bill He di 1 tot
corsider that it was properly germane 10 the matter, and the
worst results might follow us adoi tion, as explained by the gen
tleman from Maryland [Mr W C John&ont ] Those opposed
to the particular rate adopted, would combine with those op
posed to the amendment and defeat the bill altogether
Mr ^OUNG ofÑew\ork obtained the floor, (it now want
ing but ten minutes to 2 o cloek )
Mr Y said the time had gone by v* hen an argument could be
made, and if the comn uiee desired t~> vote at once he would
forego making any remaikb f Cries  of' Go ahead "] Mr \ ,
aftersome conversation yielded the floor to—
Mr SAMPSON H BUTLER, who said he had always con
stdered that if there was any question settled ry the express
terms of the Constitution, it was the power of Congress over
tina whole subject it was ds easy to make a ronstitutiot al
question of this, as on the point raised by a gentleman from Vir
gima some years since—that it was not constitutional to call the
ayes and noes, because yeas and nays was the term mentioned
io the Constitution When a proposition of this kind was started
in this House, he did not stop to inquire whether it emanated
from one party ©r the other but the question was, whether it
was constitutional and uso whether it was expedient This
power was as expiessly given by the Constitution as any
power.
It had been alleged by the gentlemen from Georgia [Mi Col
fttiiTTJ and Alabama [Mr Payne ] that the General Government
should not exercise this powei, herause it would interfere wuh
the quahficai ons of members If tin? w is true ail the Stares,
except Georgia New íerot,y New Hampshne, andtho^e which
adopted the general Uckci sys em, had been prcceedmg uncon
stitutionally, because they had made their elections under the
district system The wtnie power over this subject was derived
from Congre-s The States originally had no powei, because
the General Government did not exist, and theie was no neces
sity for such a power Could it be contended that the States
had this power, and the General Government had notí As a
legal question, it involved such absurdity that it required no
argument On the ground of principle and equity, the agent
should notbestionger than the principal If it was right to do
it for the States n followed that it must be right for the Govern
He not only believed the amendment constitutional (and he
had not time now to go into the constitutional argument) but
believed it was good policy He thought there never was a
more aristocratic, anti íepublican measure, than that which
gentlemen attempted to adopt by the general ticket system, by
which it was put m the power of one vote merely, in this coun
try, to contiol the whole balance of legislation If they adopted
the genera! ticket system, they would have nearly one and a
half million oí the inhabitants of New York unrepiesented on
this floor Was that right, just, or republican? Republican
ism was, to have the greatest possible number íepresenttd here
If he could fill up this hall w th hib own paity by a loptmg the
general ticket system he would not do it, because he beiievel
ft would re&ult 11 the, ultimate rum of this country md thepros
trationot li lertv The general ticket system wouil intioduee

Mr EVERETT inquired on what ground the Chairman so
decided?
