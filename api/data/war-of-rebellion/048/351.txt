HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY RESERVE BRIGADE,Manassas Junction, Va., October 17, 1863-1 p. m.

COLONEL: Parties have been sent out on roads to Bristoe Station and Thoroughfare Gap, and they report strong forces in their front with artillery. I have ordered out re-enforcements and go myself, and will push them as far as possible. The impression is that the enemy is moving round toward our right (to Chantilly).

A prisoner has just been captured who belongs to the Second Virginia
