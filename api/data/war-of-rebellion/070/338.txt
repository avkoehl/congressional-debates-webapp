with the rebels until they were in this town, when I charged them, driving them some distance, when it was reported that the enemy were advancing on the Williamsport road. I turned back. I could not halt my men. Lieutenants Stanwood and Jones, at the head, continued the chase. The last reports I have from them they were six miles out on the road. Stanwood about fifty yards behind the rebels giving them a volley every jump. Their force is about the same number of mine. I think some will be taken. The advance all the particulars as soon as Stanwood returns.

GREENCASTLE, July 6, 1864.

I was being flanked at Muttontown and have fallen back to this place. I have all the roads picketed here, and will try and hold out as long as I can. Lieutenant Torrence, Fourteenth Pennsylvania Volunteer Cavalry, and 20 of his men were taken in consequence of his having gone farther than I directed; 1 corporal and 5 of my men were captured with him. The force pressed me very hard at Hagerstown, and I was being surrounded when I left and fought them all the way to Muttontown. If they come upon me here I will give them the best turn I can and fall back upon Chambersburg if I am driven. Please send me rations for 100 men as soon as you can. I am completely out.
