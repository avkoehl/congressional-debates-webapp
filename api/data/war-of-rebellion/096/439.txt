Chief of Staff:

A deserter from Twenty-sixth Virginia came in early this a.m. just after the moon went down. Does not think there has been any movement of troops on our front; knows that there was something going on on their right.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding:

GENERAL: A brigade of General Ayres' division has relieved my dismounted men. About one-half the horses of my command are on the north side of Hatcher's Run. That the horses may be fed and watered and the men be able to get something to eat, I would, if practicable, like to have the men with their horses. Can I send the half of my command which is dismounted to the north side of the river, or shall I bring the horses back?

Very respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.
