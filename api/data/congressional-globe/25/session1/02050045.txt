25th Cong.....1st Sess.
Making public officers depositories—Mr. Strange.
Senate.
You stand m an attitude with these corpora-
tions, like that of a man who is engaged in strife
•with a woman, he may have the physical power
to subdue her in a moment, but there are
moral barriers stronger than any brute force, which
surround and protect both the one and the other,
and secure lo them the victory in every contest
A wre man carefully avoid;, placing himself m the
dishonorable and unprofitable belligerency before
mentioned, and there is a similar chapter for us in
the book of prudence Neithei will jour boasted
machine of a bankrupt law, such as has been pro-
posed avail yon in the strife It'is not often that I
differ from the Senator from Missouri, or the present
Chief Magistrate of the nation, but I am compelled
lo say that, according to mv present belief, no such
bankrupt law as the onp proposed, can be constitu-
tionally passed Congress has power, under the
Constitution, to establish uniform laws on the sub-
ject of bankruptcies throughout the United States,
but its power is limited to the passage o£uniform
laws It admits of veiy giave question'whether
any law can be considered uniform which is limited
to patticular classes ot such pei«ons as may be the
subject of it I know that it is insisted that bank-
rupt meant, ex vi termini, a broken banl-, and per
haps that may hive been onginally the sole use of
the term, but I am induced to believe that in the con-
struction of language v e must take the one we now
speak, as understood by those from whom w e have
derived it, our Anglo-Saxon ancestors At any rate,
we must look to the sigmfieition of language at the
time it w as used in the instrument to be con-
strued, and we well know that at that time,
all persons who dealt on credit were held to be
liable to bankruptcy, and, unless all such persons
were mide subject to the law, it might well be
questioned whether it is uniform But even if we
allow that a law would pre peilv be called uniform
which contained trie same provisions for ev^rv
State in the Union, stilt, being a debalab'e quts
ton, it w uld excite the public mind, and in favor
of the banks the law would be rendered powerless
by public opinion This, then, is a mechanical
power upon which you cannot rely, and none
other is left to aid you in coercing the will of those
corporations to the performance of duty
I have thus suggested some of the objections
which present themselves to my mind, to two of
the plans, and the question may be asked, and it is
proper it should be answered, whether any of them
ap,ly to the thud and only remamn g a terti?tive
nmsure' and my it pons ^, no It is net, like
the United States Bank, at wa* w it i any declara-
tion of public opinion To that ordeal it i« yet to
be submitted, and I am well content that it shall be
brought to so just a stain ard, and that it shall
be pressed no longtr than it is foi nH in accor-
dance with it It has no hostility frc in the Exe"u

not clearly granted by the Constitution, and whe-
ther expedient or not, s the only question foi \hich,
I trust before I hate finished I shall have ••w
ceeded in making at least n show of prob bility

be offered in extenuation of neglect, no honest
men uncensciouslv enlisted by interest, by grati-
tude, by innumerable insidious appeals to ardent
natures, be inductd to step forward, and oppose
their to lies to the execution of the laws No parly
spirit can be rained m behalf of the delinquent
No shout of party triumph w ill be heard to animate
his soul to bold defiance, but he will stand alona,
a conspicuous maik for that approbation which
fidelity is sure to win, oi the sober condemnation
which is as certain'y visiteu by enlightened public
opinion upon a faithless or factious public servant
The pi m is recommended to us by its simplicity,
according, in this, with the -whole genius of our in
st tutions One main object of our political fore
fathers w as to deprive Gov ernment of all that m v °-
ticism with which kingcraft had invested it It
was intended that oui sys'em of government
should be so simple that every citizen (as all
take part in its action) should he capable of
comprehending it, that whosoever could read,
or hear read, our excellent Constitution, should
understard its meaning, and be able to judge of the
fidelity of those to whom its administration was
committed The simplicity of this plan, then, is in
beautiful conformity with the rest of the system ot
which it is intended to consti'ute a part
But it has the dec sion of time in its lehalf For
au_rht we know to tn°coi trary, it has li^ei suhstin-
tnlly the piactice of all Gervein nents, except our
own, up to the piesent day fo various modifica-
tions it has doubtless been subjectec', but even in
England, a wide spaee is kept between the Exche-
quer and the bank
The pelfect accessibility of the Government
to its proper funds is a encumstance neemst whtch
it w ould take much to weigh with any prospect of
overbalancing it Yel objections have been urged
to the plan, and it is prnpei we should consider
them And first, it is said the revenue will be
exirsed to peculation much more than it is at pre
s nt Y/h, st,' It ispeitinen'lv asked by ll ePre
ldert in his Message, do \ aulrs become le s secure
in a Trpasury Department than when located in a
bank ne house' And it might have been also
a«ke I do men change their natures less fn m be-
coming officers in a bank than in the emploj ment
of the Government? Surelv, the same securities
can be provided in the ene caspas in tuc othei

Virginia in ists that experience is against us, ami
cites an mst-ince from his own Sate, where high
character and reputed integrity  in the officer, had
not been sufficient to prefect the public treasure;
but instances might likewise be cited, were I dis-
posed to do so, wh^re defalcation had taken place
where it was the custom to make deposites m
a bank, which custom was enfofced by law.
There is less danger it is said to the public under
the banking system, although the stockholders may-
be exposed to the losses whtch would have other-
wise fallen upon the Government In answer to this,
Isay,m the first place, theie never has yet been a
winding up ot the transact ons of the Government
with the banks, so that it is impossible to say what
have been its losses, but granting the position to be
correct, I answ er farther, that in a national point of
view, one evil is nearly as great as the other But
after all, the same officers whom you are now re-
quired to trust wi'h the collection of the money,
and whose honesty must, of necessity, be subjected
lo that test, aie those who under the plan proposed
would be its depositories, and but little additional
demand would therefore be made upon their integri-
ty Yet, for the salre of the argument, let it be
conceded that each particular portion of the public
Treasuiy would be subjected to seme additional
hazard, it seems to me, altogether indisputable that
the aggregate would bn infinitely less exposed to
be lost, or rendered useless , and who is there who
would not be willing to put a portion of his estate
in greater hazard, to rer ler the balance more se-
cure, or even to make an absolute loss by paying
an insurance' This consideration alone is, I think,
altogether sufficient to dispose of the argument
I am glad to find that no gentleman has in de-
bate seriously relied upon the additional expense
to wliuh the sub-tre"isury system, as it has been
called, vv ould subject the nation, but it has been
adverted to m the new spapers, and we may pel-
haps >et heir it on th s floor It is shown to be
very inconsiderable, and, even if it were much
gieaier, the idvintages pt-~DOsed are nothing rf
tint expense m being weighed against them, would
not be as a feathei to a pound weight
The Senator from Virginia objects to the p'an
proposed on account of its tendency to produce
another chatter for a United States Bank In the
deprecation of such a result, I w ill most cordially
unite with that gentleman, but I cufTe"- with him
altogether in his ant cipations of the modus operandi
of the t\ o plans upon the public mind I can see
m the plan to which he clings with so much tena-
city, the most direct tendency to the re-establish-
ment of that institution so od ous to us both Let
tne maxim once be sett ed ' ?t trie fiscal cancel's
of this Government cannot be managed without
bink agency and the bl ide of wheat does not
more certainly spimg from the gram deposited m
the eaith, than a Umt=d States Bank will spnrg
into being fiom that maxim Every one must see,
ev er\ one will come to sea that if this bank agency
be neeessan a hank deriving its existence and
fcim and tie ]pw of its action from the Gov ern-
ment which uses it must possess aeh antages over
every ethei,andthe Constitution will be moulded
to meet this con cfion Bu' the direct ten 'ency of
re o'tin * to an i depen lent treasury, will be to im-
press the piblic with the be'ief that the Govern-
