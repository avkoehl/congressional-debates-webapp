Adjutant-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward to the War Department nine stand of colors captured from the enemy by the Twenty-third Army Corps at the battle of Franklin, on the 30th of November, 1864. They are borne by the gallant soldiers who are recognized among their comrades as the actual captors of the flags and as the representatives of the noble regiments to which they belong. The following are the names of the soldiers to whom this special honor is awarded: Captain John H. Brown,* Company D, Twelfth Kentucky Volunteer Infantry; Captain George V. Kelley,* Company A, One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry; Corpl. Joseph Davis,* Company C, One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry; Corpl. Newton H. Hall,* Company I, Private John H. Ricksecker,* Company D, Private Abraham Greenwalt,* Company G, Private John C. Gaunt,* Company G, One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry. These flags, with eleven others were captured by Brigadier General J. W. Reilly's brigade (First Brigade, Third Division) along its parapet. They afford, at the same time, evidence of the strength of the enemy's column of attack and of its disastrous repulse.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
