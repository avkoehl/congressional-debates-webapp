Wilmington and Charleston, the only two ports now available. The tonnage at present commanded by the Government is entirely inadequate to so large an export. General McRae advises, under date of 4th ultimo, the purchase by him of fourteen steamers, the first four of which were to sail from England in the present month. These additional facilities may enable the Government to raise its exports to the requisite figure, provided in the meantime arrangements are perfected for the regular and prompt delivery of sufficient cargoes at the ports. I apprehend that in making their estimates the chiefs of bureaus did not take into consideration the supplies to be delivered under certain contracts.

First. The Collie contract places at the disposal of the--

Second. The Davis-Fitzhugh contract will furnish at our posts between this and October some five or six cargoes of general supplies.

Third. The contract made by the Quartermaster's Department with Messrs. Rosenberg & Haiman provides for the delivery in Liverpool, payable in cotton at Wilmington, of 100,000 pair of shoes and a like number of suits of clothes, the whole to be delivered previous to 1st October next. Deliveries to the extent of &11,432 1/2 had been made previous to 1st July ultimo.

Fourth. Other contracts for the delivery of supplies payable in cotton have been made. They will probably produce something, but they are so indefinite that no calculations can be based upon them. I would also call your attention to the fact that in making up their estimates the chiefs of bureaus do not seem to have considered the limited importing capacity that the Government is likely to command. This capacity is largely estimated, I think, at 2,000 tons per month. The estimate of the Commissary-General is based upon import per month for his department alone of 2, 3000 tons of freight; that of the chief of the Niter and Mining Bureau on the import for his Bureau alone per month of 1,600 tons.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. L. BAYNE,

Lieutenant-Colonel.

MACON, August 14, 1864.

Hon. J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary:

I have called out the militia; will get 4,000 or 5,000. I ask for 5,000 stand of arms, with accouterments and ammunition. Call was made by order of Legislature at urgent request of Major-General Maury. One thousand men already reported; cannot get arms without your order, although promised by General Maury. Fatal consequences may follow failure. The Confederate forces here cannot save Mississippi or Alabama. General Forrest reports enemy 25,000 in Lafayette County. You know our resources.

CHAS. CLARK,

Governor of Mississippi.
