the «ttitement of that f ict affords i sufficunt rcn-
son for extending to them whatever bent fit tluy
may sain, as dtbtois of the Governmtnt, ftom
the ET^nt ral op ration of the bill
The gentleman from Rhode Island has made
an elaborate investigation of precedents, and has
shown very conclusively that they do not exhibit
a uniform practice of the Government, but that,
deciding every case upon its own merits, and
Hith more or It.si consideration, Congress has
sometimes granted, and sometimes refused, ap-
plications somewhat similar to this Fiom the
number of such precedents, and from the fict
that previous decisions have been thus contra-
dictory, I can readily infei that there is an inher-
ent defect in the existing laws, which, as I be-
lieve, and have stated, can only be remedied by
the introduction of the warehousing system, un-
der which such cases could not occur, but as the
precedents do not establish a general rule, and
as the present case is marked by circumstances
in many respects unprecedented, I do not see
anything that should deter us from the exercise
of an independent judgment in deciding it.
The gentleman from Rhode Island grounds
another objection upon the fact that the relief af-
forded by this bill is so inconsiderable that it can-
not be desirable It is, indeed, fortunate for the
merchants and for the Government, that the fire
did not occur a few years sooner, when almost
all imported goods were subject to duty, and, in
many instances, a very heavy duty, and when,
of course, the average amount of bonds remaining
unpaid must have vastly exceeded the sum which
is now payable If the amount of duties upon
goods destroyed by the fire, instead of being, as it
is, less than a million of dollars, had not been less
than five millions, and if the amount of duties
upon other goods, payable at the momer t, instead
of being between three and four millions, had not
been less than fifteen or twenty millions, I agree
■that the magnitude of the claims of the public
debtors would heve been such that the Govern-
ment must have yielded to the necessity, the un-
controllable necessity, of the most hbeial and ex-
traordinary measures of relief Still the duty of
the Government is not to be strictly measured by
the magnitude of the claims, and if it were, I can
deduce no other conclusion fiom the gentleman's
premises than that, under the existing circum-
stances of this case, we ought to do far more than
the bill proposes—a conclusion, to say the least,
manifestly mfompatible with the gentleman's
avowed dptrrrmnation to do nothing
The relief afforded by the bill, I am free to
admit, does not correspond to the exigency of the
case I hope that still more may be done, espe-
cially that another bill for the remission of duties
upon goods burnt may be reported and passed,
and that the Secretary of tlif Treasury may give
euch a direction to the public funds, already col-
lected and constantly accruing at New York, as
to make them available for the greater accommo-
dation of the moicantile community, from whom
these funds have been derived An enlightened
policy seems to me to justify and require such an
administration of the finances at the present mo-
ment, and its results, I am well persuaded, must
be extensively and permanently beneficial I say,
then, let all this be done; and let this bill be
passed, in the first instance, as a measure of sim-
ple justice and manifest expediency, and as an
earnest of the disposition of Congress to sanction
the other measures which should succeed it. Let
this bill, at least, be judged and decided upon its
own merit; and, if there remains no other objec-
tion to it than that it does not afford sufficient
relief, let that objection be removed, as has been
just suggested, by further legislation, and by the
arrangements of the Treasury Department.
The gentleman from Rhode Island does not
exaggerate the influence and importance of the
city of New York.   That city sustains a relation

SLAVERY IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.
SPEECH OF HON. R. H. GOLDSBOROUGH,
OF MARYLAND,
In the Senate, March 3, 1836.
The question of the Abolition of Slavery in the Distnctof
Columbia being before the Senate,
Mr. GOLDSBOROUGH said-
Mr President: It was my wish to have de-
clined s tying anything upon the petitions on your
table, but the deep interest involved in them for-
bids that com se The people of Maryland and
the people of ten other States in this Union have
a great common stake at risk—not of property
alone, but of tranquillity, of peace, and of secur-
ity Under such circumstances I should have
been remiss in being silent, and I should have
felt self íeproach in not adding my efforts to those
of others to arrest the general misfortune.
It has been charged upon some Senators here
from the South, that they have exhibited a most
excited feeling on this occasion, and that they
have yielded to it Sir, I am not surprised at
this feeling—it is no dissembled excitement. If
they who make the criticism could only translate
themselves into the position which those gentle-
men hold, and feel, with them, and all aiound
them, the stake and risk vv hich they have depend-
ing on the issue, they would not, they could not,
feel less, and if they could extend their views to
the vauous and vast communities fiom which
those gentlemen come, they would witness a thrill-
ing state of anxiety that no tongue can describe.
At this moment, and from the early part of this
spssion, the whole slaveholding country is and
has been moved by a most intense anxiety—it is
an anxiety that looks to a destiny to be produced
by your decision, and whether that decision is to
leave them in the peaceful enjoyment of domestic
secunty and comfort, or to involve them wrong-
fully in all the horrors of an awful calamity, is the
suspense which gives rise to that solicitude Sir,
theie is not a mail or a messenger arriving at this
day within their borders—not a door opened in
their domiciles, but the ready interrogatories are
propounded, what is the news fiom Washington'
Is the question of abolition settled—and how' A
country, and the representatives of a country,
agitated by such causes, cannot be expected to
present an appearance or tone of much calmness
or apathetic contcntedness Abolition in the Dis-
trict of Columbia would be a greater evil—far
gieater—than any protracted foreign war that
could be waged with any nation or country. In
the latter case we could trust, and well trust, to
the united resources of the whole country—mind,
sinew, wealth; but in the former there would be
no peace, no hope, but a recourse to a state of
things, at whicli the mind revolts, and which would
rob both, peace and hope of every charm.
The proposition immediately before the Sen-
ate regards the mode of disposal that you aie
to adopt as to this and other petitions of a like
natine, which pi ay for the abolition of slavery in
the Distuct of Columbia The source fiom which
thi-> proposition spnngs [Mr Calhocn] always
commends my aspect, and if I differ with him
on this occasion, my dissent is founded upon tho
opinion that the couise suggested, under all cir-
cumstances, is not the best course. My object
is to keep the question of abolition insulated and
unmixed with every otliei subject I desire to
pi ict it in no situati >n that it can gain any ex-
titneous aid, my wish is, that it should neither
impart noi íectivc force 01 strength to or from
anything else. When we see Senatois on this
floor entertaining and animatedly dt fending their
opinions, that "noi to receive these petitions" would
not only be unconstitutional, but would be a vio-
lation of the bntliuglit privilege of eveiy freeman
—tho light of petition—how many may we justly
suppose there are out of the dooi s of this Capitol
who entertain like opinions' And if an impres-
sion gets abroad, right or wrong, that this Sen-
ate has disposed of these petitions in a way or
by means in which they have disregarded the
guaiantees of the Constitution, and robbed the
people of a privilege that has been the character-
istic of freemen in all ages, can we conceive of
anything more calculated to produce a state of
mind and feeling abroad that would add sympa-
thy and numbers to the abolition cause' Could
anything be done here that would enable the
friends of abolition to impress a belief generally
that the right of petition had been contumaciously
denied the people' It matters not whether that
impiession is attempted to be made either from
misapprehension or misconstruction—the effect
would be the same. New efforts would be made
with redoubled aidor by quadiupled numbers,
when the petitioners would give s'aength to their
cause by uniting it with a vindication of their
supposed violated rights Yes, sir, and the same
presses that are now teeming with every species
of publication so deleterious to oui peace, to aid
the cause of abolition, would, in that case", spiead.
as far and as widely abioad, through their thou-
sands of agents, denunciations against Congress
for trampling down the great safeguard of pop-
ular fieedom—the right of petition
In the few remarks which I made some weeks
ago, when this subject was before us in a more
transient form, I then indicated the course that
I should prefer, and that was a calm and more
silent one. My judgment dnected me to think
that the bettei course would have been to have
received the petitions,and to have laid them upon
the table, until some proposition could have been
either foimally or informally suggested and pre-
pared, in form of resolution or otherwise, under
which we could have disposed of them, assigning
a reason for so doing, or, if preferred by others,
that the petitions should have gone to a commit-
tee, and that they should have made a brief re-
port of the grounds of rejecting the prayer of the
petitioners, for I am happy in the belief that there
is not a Senator on this floor who is not opposed
to the object of the petitioners. And I would
have done this, sir, under a hope, and with the
design of rationally influencing a large portion of
the signers to these petitions, however enthusi-
astic the other poition of them may be, as I am
peisuaded they are rational, though mistaken and
misguided men, and such men I would wish to
propitiate by truth and reason My design would
have gone furthei, too, I wished to have waylaid
the ear and the understanding of the rest of the
world, who were not influenced by the spirit of
propagating this destroying system into the midst
of the slaveholding country, and I would have
appealed to their unpledged judgments, to their
sense of philanthropy for us, to have erected them
as a mound to prevent the further rise of the
troubled waters that threaten to overwhelm us.
On this, and on all trying occasions, we must ap-
peal to public opinion, it is the great arbiter at
last, it is the only sovereign acknowledged in our
land, we cannot resist its power, if we would It
is true that this monarch is sometimes maddened
with the fervor of the moment, and it becomes
our duty to compose it; if it is subject to delu-
sion, we hope, as we believe, that it is capable of
being recdlltd to reason.
