att-ly less, until on the 13th day of February,
1805, a few weeks before the surrender of
General Lee, when the failure of the confed-
eracy became evident to all the world, Russell
began, to use a nautical phrase, to "boutship,"
and accordingly he addressed a remonstrance
to the confederate agents and authorities
against what he called " the offense thus
offered to her Majesty's authority and dignity
by the de facto rulers of the southern States."
and referred to their acts as totally unjusti-
fiable and manifestly offensive to the British
Crown; thus evincing in his last as in his
first act the same shameless disregard of truth,
justice, and honor so manifest throughout the
entire conduct of his Government with the
United States during the rebellion. For he
was well aware, duriug its continuance, of the
building and equipping of privateers in Great
Britain, as well as the purchase of immense
stores of arms and war material, by the con-
federate States.
In 1863 he was placed in possession by Mr.
Adams of an intercepted letter of the secre-
tary of the confederate navy to Mr. Mason,
confederate commissioner in London, wherein
be announced the contract made by his de-
partment with the Messrs. Laird for the con-
struction of six iron-clad steamers, combining
the capacity of fighiing and freighting ships,
with which they intended to break the block-
ade of the southern ports; but liussell pro-
fessed to doubt the information, and when he
was furnished with further testimony of the
clearest and most convincing kind by our
minister on the 4th of September, 1863, who,
in the name of his Government, "entered a
last solemn protest against the commission
of such an act of hostility against a friendly
nation," be replied tha't "her Majesty's Gov-
ernment are advised that they cannot inter-
fere in any way with these vessels."
Bat when he saw the confederacy doomed,
and the restoration of the Union assured;
when he saw two thirds of our merchant
marine at the bottom of the ocean or trans-
ferred to English owners; when he saw our
great preponderance as a maritime nation
gone, and his country powerless to inflict any
further injury upon us, with safety to them-
selves, then the virtuous indignation of Peck-
sniff llussell was aroused, and he tells the
South that he had just heard of their attempt
to abuse the Hospitality of her most gracious
Majesty by makiug the territorial waters of
Great Britain the place of preparation for war-
like armaments against the United States.
And though every act and every step_ of the
confederate agents was with the sanction and
approval of Great Britain, as I have clearly
shown, and Lord Chelmsford acknowledged
in the House of Lords on the 16th of May,
1861, three days after the proclamation of
neutrality, " that if the southern confeder-
acy had not been recognized as belligerents
any Englishman aiding them by fitting out a
privateer would be guilty of piracy," thus
showing clearly that it was for this very pur-
pose of making the territorial waters of Great
Britain the place for war-like armaments
against the United States that the proclama-
tion was issued, for this Russell, with the
brazen effrontery and shameless hypocrisy
which is so characteristic of his countrymen,
assumes a virtuous indignation at the acts of
the confederate agents. Wben their money and
credit were gone, and the power of the con-
federacy broken, after four years of as heroic
a struggle as the records of history can furnish
he tries like a hunted thief to deceive his pur-
suers, and to escape responsibility he insults
the agents of the fallen confederacy and the
intelligence of the American people.
Ah, what years of suffering, of sacrifice, and
of slaughter were these to men of the same
nation. How many thousand of homes were
made desolate in the North and the South.
How many thousands of widows and orphans
aud fathers and mothers were left to mourn
for husbands, fathers,and sons; how.the war,
encouraged and sustained by Great Britain,
finally swept over the fair South, consuming
like a fire from another world the gathered
wealth of two centuries and the household
goods of many generations ; and how like a
pestilence it entered every household in the
North, carrying death and woe and mourning
and misery, and leaving behind a debt so vast
that its mere interest will remain as a legacy
to oppress unnumbered generations. When
we had no debt worth speaking of, and na-
tional taxation was almost unknown, we had
the advantage of England ; but now, thanks
to her hatred of the Republic, she has helped
us to a debt nearly as vast as her own, and
dragged us down from nearly the first to the
fifth position among the nations as a maritime
Power, while she has gained what we have
lost. Her cruisers under confederate colors,
and sometimes, as the evidence shows, under
her own, not alone burned our ships, or caused
them to be transferred at a heavy loss to Eng-
lish owners, but she deprived us of a profit-
able commerce, which would be worth at least
to us to-day $30,000,000 a year more than it is,
as shown by the following table, taken from
the report of the select committee of this House
on the causes of the reduction of American
tonnage to the Forty-First, Congress. I ask
the careful attention of this House and of the
country to the figures taken from that report,
and to the remarks of the committee which
follow:
" Value of Tonnage—The estimated value of the
tonnage of the United States engaged in the foreign
carrying trade was, in 1861. $108,347,748, the esti-
mated gross yearly earnings of which was thirty-three
and one third per cent., or $36,115,916. In 1869 the
estimated value of the same tonnage was $<0,488,940,
and the estimated earnings $23,496,315, n net loss in
yearly earning of this interest of 812,619,601. (Table
No. 14 of the Appendix.)
"The increase in gross earnings ot this class ot
tonnage from 1850 to 1860 was $14,719,397, or seventy-
three per cent. Taking the same ratio of inorease
from 1860 to 1869, say sixty-five per cent., and we
should have, in 1869, $57,417,643. The actual amount
of gross earnings is 823,496,315, or a net aunual loss,
in consequence ol the decline of our ocean oommerce,
of $33,921,328. , . , .
" It is difficult to realize that ourcountry, which m
little more than half a century ending in 1860 had
reached the very foremost rank of maritime nations,
has in less than a decade lost half its merchant ship-
ping and all its maritime prestige, and that we now
stand debating whether we shall without a struggle
yield all, and become the mere commercial depend-
ency of the nation for whose advantage we havo
been thus despoiled and reduced."
How truly Cobden said in the House of
Commons in 1864—
"You have been oarryingon hostilities from these
shores against the people of the United States and
have been inflicting an amount of damage on that
country greater than would be produced by many
ordinary wars. .
It is estimated that the loss sustained by the
capture and burning of American vessels has been
about £15,000,000. But that is a small part of the
injury inflicted oa the American marine. We have
rendered the rest of her vast mercantile property for
the present valueless."
The following table will show the total for-
eign commerce of the United States in 1850,
1855, 1860, and 1869 :

It will be seen by the foregoing that in 1850,
seventy-five per cent, of our total exports
and imports were shipped in American vessels,
In 1§55, seventy-five per cent, in American,
aud twenty;five percent, in foreign vessels. In
1869, thirty-four per cent.( in American'to
sixty-six per cent, in foreign vessels. . Our
exports have doubled siuce 185,3, while the
percentage carried in American vessels has
fallen from sixty-seven per cent, to thirty-four
per cent.
Now, if we calculate the loss of Anjericah
tonnage at $30,000,000 a year for ten yeafs,
we have the sum pf $300,000,000 loss to the
nation, and this is exclusive of the advantages
which would be derived by the repairs to our
ships,, the employment of mechanics* sailqrs,
merchants, &c. t _
In 1861 the interest on our national d^bt
was $6,000,000. After the close of the war in
1866 the interest was $138,000,000. From the
1st of March, 1861, to the 1st, of March, 1872,
the gross interest paid on our national debt
for these elevenyears amounts to the enormous
sum of $1,000,430,000. On tie 1st of March,
1869, the gross debt of the United States
amounted to $2,525,196,461 74, all of whioh
is a mortgage upon the property of the nation
and the labor of its citizens.
A large portion of these bonds were purchased
by foreign capitalists, at prices ranging from
forty-five to fifty-five per cent, of their face
value in gold, and they now receive for tbem
their full face value in gold, so that we will
have really paid as interest on our debt in
fifteeu yeara a sum equal to the original amount
received by the. nation for our bonds. It is
too painful to think of the enormous load of
debt, with its interest of $100,000,000 a year,
which we must leave to future generations. To
this must be added for the present a pension
list of $30,000,000 a year, and if to this we
could add the value of property destroyed in
the South, we would have'a correct idea of
what England has done for our couutry in
encouraging and sustaining the most costly and
destructive war in the history of the human race.
In May, 1866, Mr. Fish declared that we were
two great nations of common origin, common
language, common literature, common inter-
ests and objects, in the advancement of the. civil-
ization of the age. What our emollient Sec-
retary of State may have meant by this congre-
gation of adjectives, I am at a loss to know.
Didbeordidhenot mean that Great Britainhad
on every favorable occasion taken very com-
mon means of destroying our common inter-
ests, of commonly stealing our property, com-
monly burning our ships, commonly helping
to slaughter our soldiers, and of using our
common language to commonly stigmatize
and commonly revile the common people of
this common Republic ; the people of which,
in common with the great aforesaid Anglo-
Saxon "What is it," are marching hand-in
hand to civilize the Chinese with opium, the
Bast Indians with cannon balls; and when
they fail, by making cannon balls of the bodies
of the aforesaid Indians; and in exterminating
the Irish, with the very newest and most
approved system of Anglo-Saxon civilization,
by which a whole race can be robbed.of liberty
and property, and the world cooly informed
that it is done in the ipterest of a.cotmjrdh
literature, and for the advancement 6f the
civilization of the age " and the fr£e circula-
tion of the Scriptures.
Secretary Fish, of course, may have meant
to be sarcastic, or complimentary, or dignified,
or hyperbolical,'butlpresumetio outliving can
tell exactly what he did mean, and if he knows
himself what he meant, I hope he will inform
the world ere he dies, and not let yet unborn
generations "burst in ignorance." If he in-
tended to rebuke England with sarCa'siri, we
can understand and appreciate the great-depth
of his diplomacy, and do credit to the profound
head that could not alone bother o&r hered-
