Brigadier-General CRAWFORD,

Commanding on the Weldon Railroad:

Major-General Warren is directed to send you a brigade before night to strengthen the line on the eight of Fort Wadsworth. Upon its arrival you will let General Ferrero close in on his right and strengthen his line, and put the brigade General Warren sends in the rifle-pits on the right of Fort Wadsworth, or if you can arrange it more advantageously by putting the brigade in reserve, so as to support the line promptly between Fort Davis and Fort Wadsworth, do so.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
