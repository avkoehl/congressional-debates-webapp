best hope that our free institutions may yet be pre-
served
Mr Chairman, in 1827, the Cherokee 'abe of
Indians organized a Government with a written
constitution and code of laws, extending over all
that portion of territory then m their occupancy
wtthin the limits oí Georgia The Cherokees
claimed exclusive jurisdiction over the persons and
things within their limits. What, sir, was the con-
sequence' The bad, the profligate, the idle, all
grades of the human character from every portion
of the country, were rapidly congregating in the
Cherokee nation. Public highways, connecting
ihe white settlements in Georgia, Tennessee, and
Alabama, were fiequently beset by these lawless
wretches, robbery, and murder was the necessary
consequence These examples weie quickly imi-
tated by the more ignorant India... The scene
was too shocking to describe. If, perchance, the ot-
ienders were likely to be brought before the tribu-
nals of the Cherokee nation, they sought safety m
flying to the mountains in Georgia and Carolina,
Tennessee and Alabama, and then would again
commence new operation , by plundering the In-
dians. When m the Cherokee country, they
would plunder the whites, when on the borders of
the settlements, they would plunder the Indians,
and so numerous and well organized was this band
iof thieves, that for a length of time the arm of the
judiciary, the ministerial officers of the law were
resisted, and often baffled by the superior force
of the offenders, m the due administration
of the laws. This state of things, brought
about solely by the pretensions of this In-
dian Government, could not longer be en-
dured. The jurisdiction of Georgia and her  
sponsibihty to herself and the world, for preserva ¿
the rights, of her citizens of pioperty and life itself
imperiously demanded ol her, as the Government
had failed to remove the cause of this annoyance,
<o arrest the evil. Well, sir, what was the first
step taken by Georgia to accomplish this object,
which the candid of all parties must admit was
her duty' It was, by legislation, to extend her
criminal jurisdiction over her entire territory, and
thereby abrogating the Indian form of Government
Was not the Indian as much protected by this act
as the white man' Was it not as much, nay
more, necessary to protect the Indian than any
other portion of ow population' Their own
laws had proved inadequate to the object,
they had been tried and failed. Instead of
preserving order, the result was endless con-
fusion, and misrule We had stood by and seen
the experiment iully made, and it had most sig-
nally failed. Every principle therefore of en-
lightened humanity, as well as of honor, of patriot-
ism, and of State sovereignty, demanded the course
that Georgia pursued. Yet, sir, it ts remarkable,
that for this act of Georgia there has been an um-
lorm and deep voice of censure, from a particular
quarter of this Union, from that cay to this. Nor
has there been any thing left undone, that could
thwart the policy of Georgia, m adjusting her
own domestic rights and interest, to which it is
even indecent on the part of other States to al-
lude, in the terms of censure, much less of inter-
ference, and more especially the older States of
this Union. If, sir, I were disposed to retort, by
telling the story of outrage, cruel, merciless,
and vindictive as it was, even to the extermination
of whole tribes, what answer are gentlemen pre-
pared to give' Where aie the tribes that once in-
habited this country from Maine to Georgia'
Either swept from the face of the earth, or here
and there small numbers residing in obscure
corners, broken down in spirit, degraded, poor,
and miserable. Yet, sir, we of Georgia are to
receive lectures on morality, on the rights of the
Indians, of humanity to savages, from the people
of those States whose forefathers have extermi-
nated tribe after tribe, by their just, and humane
policy to the savage1 Did it ever occur to those who
are thus unjustly dealing out their denunciations
against Georgia, how different must be the judg-
ment of posterity from their own, when history
«hall tell the solemn truth, that the humanity and
justice of the East and North, as well as portions
of the South, had extermmatsd the mighty tribes
that once held the possession of those sections,
long before the close of the eighteenth century,
while at this day the cruelly and injustice of
Georgia towards the savages a. her State had
enabled them to boast of men of the first talents,
high literary attainments, and in numbers exceed-
ing the entire Indian population of all the old
States together These are things, sir, of which,
as an American, I can take no pleasure in ad-
verting to, but, as a Georgian, I can onlj feel all
the emotion-* of di-gust, when I hear my State
denounced for her Indian policy, by the people of
States who have hunted down, as the wild beast
of prey, the last of the red man within their bor-
ders If we are to be lectured, let it come from
pure hands and honest hearts, not from those
whose practice it is to preach justice, equality and
humanity abroad, while at home every act is
shrouded with designs black and wicked
But, Mr Chairman, there are other facts that
should be known to this committee and the nation,
in order to un ' rstand the true position of Georgia
By the treaty of 1819 with the Cherokees, made
with Ross, Gunter, and others, who have been
opposing the late Cherokee treaty, there is an
express reservation in favor of John Ross, Lewis
Ross, John Martin, James Brown, John Burge,
Edward Gunter, Richard Taylor, Thomas Fore-
man, and Richard Fields, and a number of others,
of 640 acres of land to each, provided they wished
to become citizens of the United States, &e
Now, sir, I will state also, as a fact not generauy
known, that this \ ery same John Ross, Lewis Ross,
Ei«ard Gunter, George Lowrey, and John Gunter,
dil out mi, in wuting, which was regularly reeordea
at the Cherokee Agency, their applications for the
reservations as set forth in the treaty I w ill give
the letteis of Lev\is. Ross and John Ross

Sir   \glaeable to the 3d article oí the ueaty signer! at W ash

to me in said treaty

Cheek Agency, June 17,1819
Sir  Finding that some of those persons who have been
gianted special leservatisns in fee simple, by the late treaty,
concluded at Washington City on the 27th day of February
last, have thought proper to report to you, agreeable to the con
dmon stipulated m the thud article of said treaty, notwith
standing I am fully convinced in my opinion that said condi
tion does not immediately apply to special reservations, yet, m
ordet to avoid any mibundeisunding of the treaty I have also
thought proper to follow then example    You will therefore
pleaBe to acknowledge this as my notification, in compliance
with the afín esaid stipulated condition, that it is my 171 ten
tion to continue to occupy and enjoy permanently the land
reserved me in that ti eaty
lam, sn, your obedient servant,

Col R J Meigs, Cherokee \.gent
The letters of the others are of the same charac-
ter Mr. Chairman, can this House, will the
American people, ask more to satisfy them of the
true character ot John Ross and others Mho are
oppposmg this treaty, and the peculiar situation in
which Georgia has found herself situated' Sir, it
should be remembered that it was not until after
John Ross, his brother, Lewis Ross, and the others
now hostile to this treaty, had accepted the provi-
sions of that of 1819, constituting them citizens of
the United States, and with" a fee simple in 640
acres ol land, selected as the most valuable m the
nation, that the project was set on foot by the same
individuals, that they would sell their reservations,
return agam to the nation, assume the command
and the control of the Cherokees, organiza a Go-
vernment, adopt a written Constitution and code of
laws, to advance their own ambitious projects
What have the eulogists of John Ross to say to his
solemn, written pledge, that he intended to reside
permanently on his reservation, under the 3d arti-
cle of the treaty of 1819' Where stands Ins un-
blemished character m this transaction' Just wheie
it stands in the present It was John Ross and his
party that made the treaty of 1819, securing,
among other things, the best possessions in their
country in fee simple, with the rights of a citizsn of
the United Slates. How long did they adhere to the
conditions upon which they obtained this bounty'
No longer than was necessary for them to pocket
the profits of their treachery, and a new scene of am-
bition opened to their view He then renounced all
the rights and honor of an American citizen, and
sought for glory and distinction by again betraying
the best interests of his nation, and it is this man
and his party who, it is contended, have the sole
and exclusive right of making treaties for the Che-
rokees. Is it so, sir' Have not he and bis asso-
ciates, by their own voluntary act, as far feack as
1819, deprived themselves of the influence they
now seek to exercise'
One other fact, Mr. Chairman, I will allude to m
justification of the course of Georgia, in abrogating
the Cherokee Government. Among other oppres-
sive enactments, these people passed the following
barbarous laws for the sole purpose of perpetuating
in the hands of Ross and his party, who had then
seized upon the government of the Cherokee"
"That any person or persons whatsoever, who shall
be found guilty of forming unlawful meetings, with
intent to create faction against the peace and tran-
quillity of the people—to encourage rebellion against
the laws and government of the Cherokee nation,
shall receive one hundred stt ipes on the bare back "
Another section provides "That any person or per-
sons who shall, contrary to the Legislative Coun-
cil, enter into a treaty, &c. and agree to sell any
part or portion of the national lands, upon convic-
tion, shall suffer death." And it is, also, pro-
vided that persons who abscond, or who shall re-
fuse, by resistance, to appear at the place of trial,
are declared outlaws, "and any person of this nation
shall kill them, so ojfmdmg, in any manner wot' con-
venient, within t1 e limits of this notion, and shall not
be held accountable to the laws for the same " And
another section of the Cherokee laws provide, after
administering one hundred lashes on the naked
back, for a particular offence, "and no treaty snail
be binding upon this nation which shall not have
been ratified by the General Council, and approved
by the principal chief'
I will not spend ihe tune of the committee in
commenting on these laws No one can mistake
their object. John Ross was the principal chief,
and no treaty could, therefore, under their law, be
binding without his approval This gave h'm the
power, unlimited and despotic as it was, that he
desired. These laws were enacted in October,
1829, and it was not until November or December,
1829, that the Legislature of Georgia extended her
criminal junsdiction over the Cherokee country
within her limits I need not here repeat what is
universally believed to be true, that these laws
prevented the great mass of the Cherokee people
fiom emigrating If one dared express a desire to
go West, or treat with the United States, we all
know his fate, and, if the reports of the day are to
believed, many paid the forfeit of that law with
their lives. Under such circumstances, Mr Chair-
man, was my State placed at the moment she took
her stand and asserted her rights If consequence^
to be deplored have resulted, they must be attri-
buted to the folly and ambition of Ross and his
party, and the delay of justice by this Government
to Georgia. Georgia acted as became her at so
momentous a crisis. Had she done less, she
■would not have commanded the respect of her sis-
ter States, herself, or of posten ty
Mr. Chairman, the honorable gentleman from
Virginia condemns the policy of this Government,
in removing all the Indian tribes West of the Mis-
sissippi That this policy, so fatal to the red man,
originated with General Jackson, and must end in
rum I think the honorable member is mistaken,
when he gives the entire credit, for so I regard it, to
General Jackson The policy of removing the
Indians West, and without the limits of the Stales,
commenced under the administration of General
Washington, and has been the settled policy of the
Government, from that day to this It is true, sir,
and so much the more creditable to General Jack-
son, that he never failed to urge this policy upon
Indian tribes within the States, or upon
Congress, on all suitable occasion1-, as the last and
onlv means ot throwing around tne savage the
efficient protection of this Government But while
I am free to admit, that this policy, under his Ad-
ministration, assumed a decided and organized
form and practical bearing, yt I will not j íeld
all the honor of this mighty work of national
humanity to General Jackson. It originated in, the
benevolent and comprehensive charity and practi-
