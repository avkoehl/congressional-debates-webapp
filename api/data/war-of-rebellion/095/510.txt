WAR DEPARTMENT,

March 1, 1865.

Respectfully submitted for the information of the President.

By order of the Secretary of War:

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

RICHMOND, March 7, 1865.

General Early reports enemy at Charlottesville. Divided his forces yesterday, and one part moved toward Lynchburg, the other down the Rivanna. He is probably going to Scottsville or Columbia, and may be making for south side of James River. Will you have the different bureaus notified, that they may save their property? Lomax is at Lynchburg, and all troops under Generals H. H. Walker and Echols have been sent there. Fitze Lee is ordered up the James, with all his cavalry. The want of forage and provisions paralyzes us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE.

Honorable J. C. BRECKINDRIDGE,

Secretary of War, Richmond.

The different bureaus have been notified.
