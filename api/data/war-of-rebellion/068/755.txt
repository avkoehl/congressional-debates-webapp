HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, SECOND ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864-11.40 a. m.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, SECOND CORPS:

All the pickets were relieved and ordered to join their command. The enemy pressed them, flanked them, and there was unavoidable confusion; many were wounded. It was impossible to withdraw them in order, so division officer says.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General of Volunteers.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,May 14, 1864.

Colonel WILLIAM BLAISDELL,

Commanding Fourth Brigade:

COLONEL: You will at once clear a road directly behind your breast-work so that troops can pass easily right from to left. You can throw the brush in front of your works. You will make the clearing in front of your works complete, and at least 80 feet wide This will be done at once.

By command of Major-General Birney:

F. BIRNEY,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

GENERAL WRIGHT'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 14, 1864-1.15 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Griffin's, Cutler's and Crawford's divisions have passed this point. The Maryland Brigade and artillery are to pass yet. The column moves very slowly. There must be obstructions at the head of it. Having superintended the setting out, and sent nearly all my staff ahead with General Griffin, I am now going to join the head of the column myself. It is one of the darkest nights at this hour I ever saw.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,May 14, 1864-4 a. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The head of my column came here a little while ago, but in the night most of the men fell out of the ranks from weariness and the command became disjointed, and part lost their way. I have nothing to go forward, for those who have come up are excessively weary. I have not more with me than would make a good skirmish line for the corps. I am pushing them out. I have spared no effort, but my men could not be gotten up. I must await their coming. The enemy is here in some force.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
