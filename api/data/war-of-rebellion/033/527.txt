a scout in after them. I am satisfied no further trouble is here to be apprehended just now from this band on the road, as they are loaded with plunder and gone southwest.

HEADQUARTERS,Saint Louis, Mo., September 12, 1863.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The advance of my troops into Arkansas has greatly increased the territory to be occupied, while my forces have been greatly diminished by sending troops to the front. I need more cavalry very much, and respectfully request authority to raise volunteer cavalry in Missouri.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

MACON, MO., September 12, 1863.

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

The storm last night blew down the wires on all the lines, leaving me without intelligence from any direction this morning. There were some apprehensions that a raid would be made on Callao. Last night I sent a squad of men up, but have heard nothing this morning. The trouble upon the roads will amount to nothing serious, though our radical friends will make the most of it; they express great regret that you were not upon it. They have also been heard to express the hope that the rebels will destroy both roads. If you should hear of some of these gents being in a dungeon for the use of such expressions, you need not be surprised.
