william l'ollahd.
Mr. SPENCER. I move to take up for
consideration Senate joint resolution No. 97.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, proceeded to
consider the joint resolution (S. It. No. 97) to
restore William Pollard to his original rank
in the engineer corps of the United States
Navy.
ihe.Committee on Naval Affairs reported
the joint resolution, with an amendment to
strike out all after the resolving clause and to
insert in lieu thereof the following:
, That thoPresidont of the United States be, and he
is hereby, authorized to nominate, and by and with
the advico and consentof tho Senate to reappoint,
William Pollard, late an assistant engineer in the
Navy, to the place from which he was dismissed.
Mr. EDMUNDS. What committee reported
that?
Mr. SPENCER. The Committee on Naval
Affairs. The matter has been l'ully investigated
by that committee.
The amendment was agreed to.
The joint resolution was reported to the Sen-
ate as amended, and the amendment was con-
curred in. The joint resolution was ordered
to be engrossed for a third reading, aud was
read the third time, and passed.
The Committee on Naval Affairs proposed
to amend the title of the joint resolution so as
to read, "A joint resolution to authorize the
restoration of William Pollard to his original
rank in the Engineer corps of the United States
Navy."
Mr. DRAKE. That is not the title. He is
not to be restored to his original rank, as that
would imply dating him back to the time of his
dismissal. It should be "to restore him to the
naval service." That is sufficient to express it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The title will be
amended so as to read, "Ajoint resolution
authorizing the reappointment Qf William Pol-
lard to the naval service,'' if there be no objec-
tion.
Mr. WARNER. I would ask the Senator
from Missouri for information, as he is on the
committee, whether if this rtian was unjustly
dismissed he is not entitled to restoration to
his old rank?
Mr. DRAKE. It was not considered by the
Naval Committee at all that this man should
come back to bis former position and date in
the Navy. That was expressly negatived. The
whole idea is that the President is to b6 author-
ized to nominate him again for appointment
into the service, thereby Obviating the operation
of an existing law which says flifct a man who
has been dismissed from the service by the
sentence of a general fcourt-martial shall not be
reinstated in the service. This is simply to
allow this man to be nominated again for reap-
pointment, and I do not wish anything to ap-
pear there, nor does the committee, that would
give indication of a purpose to let him go back
to his former date and rank.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary
will read the title as amended.
The Secretary. 4' A joint resolution author-
izing the reappointment of William Pollard in
the Engineer corps of the United States Navy."
The VICE PRESIDENT. This follows the
language of the joint resolution.
The title was so amended.
