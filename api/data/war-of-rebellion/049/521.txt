heavy, and their attention seems to have been drawn to the possibility of an attack here.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, FIRST CORPS,November 30, 1863.

[Lieutenant Colonel C. KINGSBURY, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, First Army Corps:]

COLONEL: I think that the works can be carried at or near the first angle of the pike to the left, provided that the enemy is first dislodged from the pines in front of the works by an attack from the left. This is the only practicable way I see, and that at a great sacrifice. If I were to make the assault, I would like to see the officer that is to lead on my left and have daylight to execute it in.

Very respectfully,

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.
HEADQUARTERS THIRD ARMY CORPS,November 30, 1863-10.11 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS, Chief of Staff:

As to carrying the line in my front, the two divisions being now at my disposal, I say there is no obstacle to success except those incidental to military enterprises.

Very respectfully,

WM. H. FRENCH,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,November 30, 1863-9 p.m.

[Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:]

GENERAL: In answer to your question of this evening, I do not think it practicable to successfully carry the intrechments of the enemy within the front of my command. I mean the front on either side of the old turnpike road, of which I spoke to you yesterday.

I am, sir, respectfully,

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,November 30, 1863-11 p.m.

[Brigadier General S. WILLIAMS:]

GENERAL: In answer to your question, I desire to say that, so far as could be seen, I do not consider it impracticable to carry the front threatened by us to-day, although I regard the chances of success as very much lessened, both because the enemy has prepared to-day to very much lessened, both because the enemy has prepared to-day to meet the threat there offered, and because I am almost assured that he now knows the nature of the attack it was our design to offer, and has prepared to resist it.

GEO. SYKES,

Major-General.
