Settlement of Florida—Mr. Benton.
Senate.
Seciet-try took charge of the Department that any '
of these abuses were attempted to bo corrected
It is to the  present Secretary that the country
owes the piohibition of our Navy commanders
convening our ships into horse and donkey sta-
bles   He has also, 1 understand, made some other
changes, but those commissioners have still too
much powei, without any dncct responsibility,
and it is my wish to see a new otganization of
the iNavy Depaitment, so that there may bp one
lesponsible head, a healthy body, and active and
efficient limbs to take the place of the sick}} , un
healthy condition of the present system
Befoie I close, I must say to the gentleman
from Massachusetts that my constituents alone
send more gram, flour, pork, whiskey, iron, and
other necessanes of life, which cannot be dis-
pensed with, to maiket, than two thuds of all the
New England States north and east of New York,
besides coal and lumber to an immense amount,
and depend upon industry and frugality for their
prosperity, and not upon appropriations fiom the
General Government foi lighthouses, harbois,
dry-docks, or exclusive pnvileges, as most of his
constituents do
Mr Chairman, I hope the committee will adopt
the amendment, but whether it is adopted oi not
at this session, the discussion of the subject will
call the attention of those who admmistei  the
Government to provide, by next session, a plan
to remedy the evil complained of, and it will also
let those in office know that the piople are not
either blind, deaf, 01  dumb, although they may
not have "a sea port" in thou vicinity, but are
busy scrutinizing the conduct of those intrusted
with the management of the affairs of the nation
I wish it to be distinctly undeistood that it has
not been my intention to say aught derogatory
to the private character of any man in office, it is
not the men or their private characters I attack,
but the office, and the effect piodueed by an ím
proper and improvident organization, producing
evils which those 1 represent wish to have lcm-
cdied                                  ________
SETTLEMEN V Or TLOEIDA
REMARKS OF HON. T  H  BENTON,
OF MISSOURI,
In the Senate, February 5, 18J9,
On the bill providing for the armed occupation and settle
ment of Florida, and in reply to Mr Morris of Ohio and
Mr Davis of Massachusetts
Mr BENTON said the Senator fiom Ohio had
acted with his accustomed frankness in stating
the reason which induced him to oppose this bill
It is because Florida is a slaveholding Territory,
and because the bill will have the effect ot incieas
ing the slaveholding interest Foi tin se reasons
ho opposes it, and he seems to think that God
will curse any country or place which admits of
slavery He instances St Domingo, as a coun
try which has declined and decayed because the
French, as he says, hunted the slaves with dogs,
seeming to forget the hoi i id massacie of thi white
race which took place in that island about foity
years ago, and which destruction of the white
race is the true cause of the decline of the island
He also instances Alton, as a place which has
become desolate because Mi Lovejoy, the Abo
litionist, lost his life there This may be a double
error Alton may not be desolate, may not have
experienced any decline but that which is the tem
porary effect of overaction, and if not as flourish
ing now as formerly, it may be for a very differ
ent reason than that of the wrath of the Deity
for the death of Mr Lovejoy But what has
Florida done to excite these íemarks, 01 to make
her dread the Divine vengeance> She has done
nothing against the black race or the Abolitionists
She has done nothing to cause the Deity to make
her a place of desolation, but desolate she is—des-
olate is forty one thousand square miles of her
territory, made so by the ravages of the colored
races upon the white '
Four counties of Florida are depopulated—great
numbers of families, fathers, mothers, and chil-
dren, have been massacred—a great many officers
and soldiers have been killed, and none made pris-
oners '   No prisoners—not one—not even in the
defi-at of Major Dade That defeat was a treach
erous attack before war had been openly made,
and when, at two o'clock in the afternoon, there
was no longer a man left standing—when nearly
all were dead, and the survivors, covered with
wounds and blood, lay among the dead in the
httle breastwork which they had thrown up for
then defense—when, in this condition, even In-
dian feiocity relented, and savage cruelty was
satiated—then it was that a band of forty negioes
came down upon the helpless survivors, sought
out for each one that was alive, and gave the
knife and the hatchet to every helpless being in
whom breath or motion could be found This is
what the negioes did and it was only from two
wounded soldieis, believed to be dead, but who
were able to crawl off in the night, that the de-
tails of that disastrous defeat and massacre have
come to the public knowledge So far as the In-
dians were concerned, they left a part of the
wounded alive in the breastwork, so far as the
negroes were concerned, they spared not one' i
They killed to the last man in whom they could '
find a sign of life, and the two that escaped were |
not spared by design, but believed to be dead,
and left for dead This has been the conduct of
the coloied races in Floiida, and certainly the .
Senator from Ohio should see that his sympathy
is misplaced, that it is his own white race which
has been the sufferer in Florida, and that the
colored races have exulted in the slaughter and
destruction of men, women, and childien, de
scended, like the Senator himself, from the white
bianch of the human lace                                          ]
The Senator fiom Ohio [Mr Morris] is can- [
did enough to speak for others as well as himself,
lie speaks for certain sagacious politicians, as he
describes them, who saw in this bill, from the
moment it was brought forward, a design to raise
up new Territories in the South to become slave
States, and to increase the slaveholding interest
He tells us that these sagacious politicians all
saw this effect the moment this bill was brought
in, and he applauds the foresight of these saga-
cious men Doubtless the effect of the bill will
be to increase the population of Tlonda and is
that a sufficient reason with the sagacious pohti
cians to whom he refers for opposing the bill ?
Certainly the politicians of the South and West
have not acted on this punciple in relation to the
nonslavcholding Terntories Look at Wis< on
sin and Iowa, two Territories on the Upper Mis
sissippi, both fully organized, filling up with
people, and ready to become States within less
than two year*  from this day Where was
southern jealousy when these two Territories
were oigamzed'' Where were the sagacious
politicians of the South at that time > They were
heie, sn—herein this Senate and in the House
of Uepii sentativcs, they knew very well that
they weie raismguptwonon slaveholding States,
but they did nothing to obstruct the organization
of the twoTeuitones they indulged no jealousy,
they made no political calculations, they did
what they believed was right and now all that
they ask fiom the piliticians of the non-slave
holding States is to acton the same principle—to
i do whit is ught for Flouda, without indulging
in jealousy or political calculations
The Senatoi fiom Massachusetts [Mr Davis J
has followed the Senatoi fiom Ohio, and has en
tered into an elaboiate opposition to the bill He
objects to all paits of it, the details as well as the
principle, and stienuously opposes its passage
He objects to the land bounty, and treats it as a
naked giatuity, like the fishing bounties, and
considers it a fiee gift of so much of the public
domain So far as the fishing bounties are con-
cerned, they are, where not a drawback of the
salt duty, a naked gratuity foi which no services
are rendered to the United States, but in the case
of these settltrs, the 'and will not be a bounty in
the nature of a pieimum or a gift, but will be a
bounty m the military sense of the word, that is
to say, it will be in payment, or part payment, of
military service This is the nature of the bounty
land to be granted by the bill It is not a gift,
but is a price paid for services, real services,
which are to be rendered The ten thousand
settlers in Florida are to go into stations—into
blockhouses and stockades—into fortification, in
fact, which they are to man and defend until
Florida is pacified, and the Indians are removed
They are to do the service of any army, and to
accomplish an object which armies have not been
able to accomplish They aie to render military
service, which may continue one, two, 01 moit
yeais Now, this is no gift of land Itisa'sale,
and a sale for a valuable consideration and such
a consideration as thousands will lejtct foi one
that will accept Thousands will rcfus to take
the land on the terms of the bill, for one that will
take it Perhaps few fiom the Senator's own
State will accept three hundred and twenty acres
of land on the terms proposed, yet every one of
them would certainly accept it as a gift
The Senator, therefore, ism great error in treat-
ing these bounties as gifts They aie pay for mil-
itary services, as much so as the military bounty
lands of the late war By an act of Congiess, the
soldiers in the latter part of the late war received
a bounty m land of three hundred and twenty
acres each—the soldier received this over and
above his pay, subsistence, clothing, and other
allowances The land was called a bounty, but
it was a bounty in the sense of the bounty money
paid to the reciuit at the time of enlistment, it
was pay, and not a gift The Senator comes from
a Stite which oppobed the bounty land to the
soldiers of the late wai, to aid in repulsing the
British He now opposes bounties to settlers in
Florida, to duvethe Indians from that Territory,
and m all this his State is consistent She acts
on a uniform punciple, and is entitled to respect
for her steadfastness of purpose No, sir, these
bounties are not gifts, but payments for greatand
valuable services The Senator says the land
will amount to three million two hundred thou
sand acres, and will be worth $4,000,000, and this
is true The land would bring, if sold, $4,000,000
to the Tieasury but it has to be conquered be
fore it can be sold ' It will have to be conqueied '
These sutlers will have to conquei the thiee mil
lion two bundled thousand acies for themselv s,
and, also, at the same time, will conquer above
twenty million acies tnoie for the Government
foi the Indians now have possession of twenty
six million acies of land in East Florida, the
gicatei pait of it public land, and of which the
Government can have no use until the Indians are
expelltd Grant that the land would be woith
j>4,000,000, when it is conquered, it is worth
nothing to us now, and it will  be the cheapest
fayment that can be made for the conquest of
'londa The Senator from Massachusetts is
startled at $4,000,000 yet his fishermen have
drawn upwards of six million dolíais in bounties,
and are now actually drawing, from yeai to year,
at the rate of $257,000 per annum
The Senatoi fiom Massachusetts objects also
to the íations, the medicines, the seed giams, the
tiansportation,and the hospital attendance, winch
is to bt given to the settlers He convidéis all
these aids as giatuities, as naked gifts, bestowed
upon the settlers for nothing Far otherwise is
the fact, Mr President They are in payment of
military services, they are in pait payment for
the same services for which the land is granted,
and they rest upon the same principle as similai
supplies to militia and volunteers, when called
into the service of the United States, would rest
upon The whole of these small items togethei
will not cost the Treasury more than half a mil-
lion dollars, a mere trifle compared to the expense
of calling out militia and volunteers on cveiy
alarm Governor Gilmer, with the sanction of
the Government, has just called out five hundred
men for the protection of the frontiers of Georgia,
other bodies have been called out for the protec-
tion of middle Florida and the country about St
Augustine, and these calls must be repeated as
often as depredations are committed, as often as
alaims, real or false, continue to occur The reg-
ular troops cannot guard the frontiers they may
do all they can, the Indians will elude them, will
avoid their presence, will steal in upon the settle-
ments, and will massacre families Then volun-
teers will be called out, they will come when they
are called, and they will be paid A large annual
expenditure must be looked for m this way, over
and above the expenses for the regular tioops,
until the Indians are removed, unless the country
