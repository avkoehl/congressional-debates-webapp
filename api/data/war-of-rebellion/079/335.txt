CHATTANOOGA, October 17, 1864 - 1 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

I have just received the following dispatch* from General Thomas, and will move as directed in the morning.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Ship's Gap, Ga., October 17, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

Your dispatch is received. Hood is not at Deer Head Cove. We occupy Ship's Gap and La Fayette. Hood is moving south, via Summerville, Alpine, and Gadsden. If he enters Tennessee it will be to the left of Huntsville, but I think he has given up all such idea. I want the road repaired to Atlanta, the sick and wounded sent north of the Tennessee, my army recomposed, and I will make the interior of Georgia fell the weight of war. It is folly for me to be moving our armies on the reports of scouts and citizens. We must maintain the offensive. Your first move on Trenton and Valley Head was right; the move to defend Caperton's Ferry is wrong. Notify General Thomas of these my views. We must follow Hood till he is beyond reach of mischief and then resume the offensive.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHATTANOOGA, October 17, 1864 11 p. m.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Unless I receive further orders from you, or such information as renders it unwise, I will march to-morrow with Morgan's and Wagner's DIVISIONS, via Rossville and Gordon's Mills, and join you as soon as practicable. I will bring as many beef cattle as the troops can take care of. My scouts report no enemy WEST of Lookout Mountain to-day; they report Bird and Dug Gaps held by rebel cavalry. Colonel Warner is here. I have no later information from you than what he brought.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.

CHATTANOOGA, October 17, 1864 - 1. 30 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

Your dispatch of 10 o'clock yesterday p. m. are received. I will move General Wagner at daylight, and hold General Morgan here until I am better satisfied as to the enemy's movements, so as to not uncover Chattanooga.

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General.
