THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

heart and hand, with her treasure and her re-
sources, and her blood, pledged to a strict con-
struction of the Constitution and to the Union of
t]io States.
In rhe name of a patriotic, generous, and heroic
con^titupney-— aye, sir, if my colleague will permit
me to say so—in the name of every man, woman,
and thinking child in tlie State of New Jersey, J
place my hand on that sacred instrument, and
declare for me and mine, that no letter of it shall ,
be infracted if we can help it—neither by Northern !
or Southern unwise counsels. If wrongs exist, 1
they must he redressed by law, and according to
the'Constitution. But this Union of the States—
the world's wonder—is the common heritage, as
it is the common gloiy, of all the people of all the
Slates. We must not permit one link of that
golden chain to he broken, and the hopes and
happiness of mankind, for all coming time, to he
blighted in the bud, by wild fanaticism or hasty
passion.
The motion to print was agreed to.

Oo motion by Mr. ATCHISON", it was I

JS OJV-I.NTER VEA'TION.
The Senate resumed the consideration of Mr.
Clarke'?* resolutions on the subject of non-inter- ;
vention. !
Mr. CLEMENS spoke at length on the sub- j
jects embraced in the resolutions. His speech ,
will be found in the Appendix. ,
Mr. MILLER. As I have something to say ;
m regard to these resolutions, and as the subject j
of them is "intervention or non-intervention,5* j
and as I do not wish to intervene between this
and other important business under consideration i
by the Senate, unless some other ►Senator is leady i
to speak on this subject, 1 will move that the ;
further consideration of them be postponed until j
some day next week—say Tuesday next.
Mr. ATCHISON. If it is m order to amend i
the motion of the Senator from New Jersey. 1
' will move to postpone the further consideration of
these resolution? until the first Monday m April, j
i I do this that the Senate may act upon meas- ;
ures which are now before it, of £reai importance
; to the people—practical measures, in some of,
■ which the Southwestern and Western people feel j
i a deeper interest than in any other question; os- j
1 pecialiy questions of the kind that arc now being
; discussed. I refer to our land bills.
Mr. MILLER. I think the period proposed
j by the Senator from Missouri is too long. I
' should prefer to have the subject postponed for a
i fortnight.
| Mr. SEWARD. The motion to postpone till
the first Monday in April, 1 should regaid as
equivalent to an indefinite postponement. And
regarding the matter in thai h^'ht, I ask for the
yeas and nays. ' j
The yeas and nays were ordered, and taken, 'j
and resulted—yeas 15, nays 24: as follow*: !|
YKAS—VefefT!*. Atcliaoji, hutier, Pov,ns, I'Vh, L'Sot. ,
! Hamlin, IJnnlH, Jones of fowa, Kin;r, Moiion. \r.iri-.

j So the motion to postpone till the firsst Monday ( j
in Aprd \ /as not agreed to. f|
Mr. HUJNTER. it seems to me that we ou^ht jj
1 not to postpone the further consideration of these ,j
! resolutions to a very distantday; and I would su^- ;j
| ge&t to the Senaror'from Ncw.Ttrsey, whether It
I would not be better to fix an earlier day ihcn t* e 'j
| one he has named, and dispose of them entirely. !
I I think this practice of takin^upa subject and '
' debating u for a v/hde and then postponing it,
! leads to ^reat delay, and i hope it wi1} ^uit his '
j convenience to take up this matter op an earlier
• day than thathehan named, and can'nn.e <i till it
! is disposed of.
Mr. MILLER, if I consulted my own wihlits
I would prefer to say Tuesday next. On the sur^-
1 gestion of the Senator from Virginia, • will say
Tuesday mr<t, if bcop'eenblo to him.
! Mr. I'ADGEIL I hope r^y friend from New
Jersey will vary that motion, though I entirely 1
o^ree with what has be^-n said by the honorable
' Senator from Virginia. But here is my friend from
■ Iowa [Mr. Joxes] with his bi!l, to which an un-
expected and, to him, dts'astefnl amendment ha^
been proposed, a practical measure in which the
,, State of Iowa iy deeply interested* and I really
think we owe it to him to dispose of that measure
within some reasonable turn-. 1 move to postpone
i the further consideration of these resolutions till
. this day fortnight.
Mr. HUNTER. I hope we shall be able to
•! dispose of the bill in which the Senator from :
Iowa is interested long before this day fortnight
It is not necessary to postpone it for that length
cf time.
Mr. JONES, of Iowa. There are three other
special orders, which are pressing, practical mat-
ters.
Mr. TUJNTER. When we take up a measure
of this sort, it is belter that we should continue to
act upon it until it is disposed of. I am willing
to postpone thi.s subject long enough to enable the
Senate to act finally upon the bill in which rnv
friend from Iowa is so much interested. When
it is a^ain taken up, I hope u may be finally di««-
! posed of.
; Mr. BADGrER. In a spirit of compromise, to
j which my friend from Virginia knows I am in-
; clincid, 1 will vary my motion, so as to postpone
, the subject till Monday week.
{ Mr. SMITH. I desire to .state, that what ia
usually denominated the French spoliation hill,
I was made the special order for Monday next, and
j ( am very anxious that if shall be disposed of
j next week.
j Mr. HUNTER. It is proposed to postpone
; this question till Monday week.
| The motion to postpone the further considera-
j uonof the subject till Monday week, wasagreed to.
' RAILROADS IN IOWA.
| On the motion of Mr. JONES, of Iowa, ihe
| Senate resumed the consideration of the bdlgrant-
: nig the right of way and making a §rant of land
i to'the State of Iowa, in aid of the construction of
certain railroads in said State, the pending quc -
tiou beini; on the amendment offered by Mr. Us
df.rwood to the substitute reported by the Com-
mittee on Public. Lands.
Mr. B£LL. 1 duhi'H design to occupy the «t-
1 tention of the Senate for a great while. In the iVv
; remaiks which I intended to submit, I proposed
[ to make this as serious and impressive a subject
! as I thought it deserved to be. I am taken some-
: what by surprise at the motion of my honorable
i friend from Iowa, hut I will attempt to go on, col-
i lectnig my thoughts as best I may, upon the oc-
i casion.
J mentioned the other day that this was a sub-
ijectof annual discussion. I suppose that it has
j not been omitted at any session during the la*'
1 twenty years. It is, therefore, very difficult to
| throw out any new arguments of much weight o*
| importance on the subject.
! Air. BADGER. I think it is extremely unjust
| to my friend from Tennessee, to require Inm to go
1 on now. L theiefoie move to postpone the furthei
| consideration of this subject until to-moriow.
i The motion war; agreed to.
i Mr. JONES, of Iowa. I wish to give notice
j that I shall, to-morrow morning, move to dispense
! with the consideration of private bills, in order
| that the Senator from Tennessee may proceed
j with his speech.
j EXECUTIVE SESSION.
| On the motion of Mr. BADGER, the Senate
j proceeded to the consideration of Executive bnsi-
i ness, and atW some timfl spent thc;ein, the doors
: were reopened, and the Senate adjourned.
