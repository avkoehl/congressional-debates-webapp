SECRETARY OF WAR and

Major-General HALLECK:

I get no news of Averell. It seems to be reliable that the citizens of Chambersburg declined or could not ransom this time, upon which some public buildings, my headquarters, and Colonel McClure's house were burnt. No rebel infantry as yet at Chambersburg. Our people in quiet possession of Shippensburg.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

HARRISBURG, PA., July 30, 1864.

(Received 9 p. m.)

SECRETARY OF WAR:

Just heard from Averell. He has driven Johnson and McCausland out of Chambersburg, and is following them west toward Loudon. The best part of Chambersburg is in ashes. Three thousand people thought to be houseless. Prisoner's state that that a raid is being made by Breckinridge toward Wheeling or above, to return by way of Kanawha Valley. This seems to confirm a previous opinion of Averell's of a raid in that direction. Prisoners say that Longstreet's corps is to threaten Washington, Early to hold the Valley, while Breckinridge makes his raid. I will notify Cumberland and Pittsburg. I presume General Averell wishes a copy of this sent to General Hunter.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, July 30, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General CADWALADER,

Philadelphia, Pa.:

You will immediately repair to Harrisburg and assume direction of affairs there till General Couch arrives.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

WASHINGTON, July 30, 1864-11. 45 a. m.

Major-General COUCH,

Carlisle, Pa.:

As General Cameron reported this morning that you had gone to Bedord, I ordered General Cadwalader to Harrisburg, to prepared for its defense. You, of course, will attend to that. Keep me advised of movements. I can, as yet, learn nothing of General Hunter.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
