half from the halting place and near to the rear of the enemy, according to the report of a negro who came from Lynchburg yesterday morning. Our troops were then three miles from Lynchburg. He passed through Appomattox Court-House about sunset. The fighting there was then going on. It was resumed this morning and is still continuing. About daylight he passed the last of the enemy and then lay i the woods sometime, coming in to us when he thought it was safe. He was told as he passed through Lee's army that the troops would move again about midnight. We are about ten miles from Appomattox Court-House.

General HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

A negro is just in from the advance of Lee. Left this a. m. at 6 o'clock. Their advance turned south from the Court-House, met our troops last evening, were checked, and are still halted. They seem to feel that they can go no farther. General Wright is directed to pass you train and to push up.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 10 a. m. is received. The head of my column was unable to move this morning until 8 o'clock, owing to my having moved forward during the night from the camp from which I was directed to move at 5 a. m. So far as I could learn when I halted last night about midnight the enemy was not near me, and there was no probability of my finding them halted anywhere. This is confirmed by what the people along the road state. The head of my Third Division did not begin to reach the halting place until 4 a. m. and the rations followed that division.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

A deserter or dropper out from Field's division informs me that his division resumed the march last night at midnight; that their camp was about four miles back from here (about three miles in advance of mine); that Field's was the rear of their army. Deserters or stragglers from Wilcox and Heth, just brought in, inform me their divisions
