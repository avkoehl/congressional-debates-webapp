It is not wonderfulj therefore, that discontents should havt aiibtn

tjitá ait instantly dispelled them It was lutikd with general
joy, ¿jdwaa deemed a measure of justice ti ouiih Vow in its

Ta^pgmto view this application of the surplus l y theSutet,
andsupposmg it liable, as contended loi, to be reia'leit at the
pleasure of the Secretary of the Tieasury, is it no plain ih it
the act, mstetid of abridging Executive powei, as was intended,
must greatly augment it1 It confers upon iht F^ecutive tf e
most dangerous power over the States—no less a power than
that of direct taxation, for to that a recall ol the surplus tnu&t
lead, the States having no other expedient t • sus am the l ite
rests shown thus to rest upon it
Even admitting then, that Congress may have the neh' to ex
tort from the States the surplus already paid, an I to withhold
that now due, the exercise of the i ie:ht would nor h warranted,
except on the most urgentand nresistible nece-^ity
What, sir, fs that necessity, as alleged by the Piesident inSl
assumed by this bill? It is, that the Tieasury ol the United
States is unable to sustain itself m its embau tssmtnts without
resorting to the fouith instalment intended for the Sttte*,
amounting to $9,367,214 93 the proportion ol which iransferiu-
ble to Kentucky being nearly half a iiaüion 1 have lo iked in
the spirit ofsmcere inquiry into the evidences upon which this
alleged financial necessity rests, and have looked in vain The
report ofthe Secretary of the Tieasury, submitted to Congress
W the opening ofthe session, thoueh obviously meant to magni
fy, as far as posbible, our financial difficulties, has I think ut
terly filled to establish it Information derived oflicwlly fioin
that Department since, under resolutions of this House, still
further weakens the attempt
Without entenng minutely into the condition ol the'Ireasui>,
it is, in my opinion, plainly demonstiable, that by converting
into cash (which can readily be done) the bonds held by the Go
vernment on the Pennsylvania Bank of the United States,
amounting to S7,°46,35b 16, besides interest, tncins may be
commanded fully adequate lo the wants of the Treasmy, with
out violating the act of 1836 "
The proposition to withhold this surplus would bs more tole
rabie if it were intended to prevent the creation of a new na
twnal debt, my aveision to which, if any thing could, miitit
induce me to support H But it intends no such thing The
President boldly announces to the people of the United Stale 
the startling purpose of fixing upon them a new public debt—
notinadnectform, but undei the insidious disgm <. of Piea
surynotis Th tmploymentoi ihesenotes is, in the end, moie
pernicious than any othei expedient of finance that could he
adopted f nder us covei a public debt sieali upon the nation
by decrees, imperceptible 10 the people, and the first signal of
apntoachinit dinger it, depreciated Government paper, and

In debt also, if a deficit in the means of the Treasury should
bo lomid actually to exist, why mnj it not he supplied by an
increased Issue of Treisury noles) The principle ha\ mg been
assumed, a mi re quesiion of amount can be of bill secondary
consideration

of loud and just complaint by the people The standard of

by the Federal Executive, and the influence of i policy which
convulbed and upset the regular business of the country, by
turning lo i^c a spirit of wild and ret kless speculation, liots,
mobs, insubordination, and bloodshed, marking almost every

of the countiy is such, that the becietary of the Tieasury,
enibled to discover no green spot m Us affairs not blighted by
''the evils occasioned by the waywardness of man," with

ofadministeiing that relief, bhall go forth, as this bill proposes,
with sword and torch in hand, m que^tof that same dreaded—
detestcú~discarded surplus, threatening to tear up by the
roots the most cherished systems of the States, by holding out
an eaily abandonment of them for want of means, or the dis
mal prospect of supporting them by grievous and mteimmable
taxation, and when it is íemeuibered, too, that, with the State
Governments, taxation is such m fact—dirci—and seen and
felt in every step of its progress not like that of the Federal
Gov. inment, unpeiceived and unknown by the people, except

REMARKS OF MR. THOMPSON,
Of South Carolina,
In the House of Representatives—The bill to postpone the
fouith instalment of the payment to the States being under
consideration—
Mr THOMPSON, of South Carolina, addressed the House as
follows
Mr Speaker I shall vote for the admendment of my col
league, is it makes the bill more icoeptable, but I shall vote
«gainst the bill even if thus amended Time and reflection
have only set ved to confirm mj iir«t impressions ofthe wisdom
and policy of the 1 iw depositing with the States the surplus in
the Ireasuiy The chief recommendation of that law, tome,
was not the money which it gave to the btates that was a
smiH matter, but it wa^ that a fund was provided to meet the
future exigencies of the Government—a fund which was to be
raised by each particular State in its own way, withajusf
regard to the different inteieats of eath State which could be t
hear taxation, and not by the miionty mteiest of the General
Government ah've ignoiant and reckless, a-, past experience

but all that we have teceived No such c se exists I havt,

Secietary mfoims you that $15000000 caí t ot be expended

amount to ©04 000,000 , to which add &3 OOO-COO in the hands of
disbursing officers, and >ou ha\e 469,000 000 In this estimate,
the accruing íevenue of the last half of the present year is
taken, on the statement of the Secretaiy oi the Iieasury, at
87,000000, whereas it has been proven to my entiu "ati^ac
