Captain Janes states that Colonel Kiddoo rode around the right flank and said to him: "Captain, turn to the left and go on,"whereupon he immediately marched his company by the left flank and advanced in good order, and that Lieutenant Ferdinand Holzer, commanding Company B, did the same with the first platoon of his company and dressed upon him; but that the rest of the regiment was immediately thrown into confusion, many of the companies marching by the right of companies to the front, instead of marching by the flank. Lieutenant-Colonel Terry states that he heard no order to change direction by the left flank, but that, seeing the change of direction to the left, he endeavored to get the men into line. Instead of being halted for the formation of the line, the regiment was allowed to charge as it was, and therefore accomplished nothing. The First U. S. Colored Troops remained in the enemy's works from ten to fifteen minutes before retiring, and succeeded in spiking the two captured guns. After the order to retire had been given, Captain Henry Ward, of the First U. S. Colored Troops, resolutely remained behind with a few of his men, and endeavored to bring off the captured guns, but was himself taken by the enemy. The losses in the First Brigade were 1 officer and 15 men killed, 6 officers and 136 men wounded, 1 officer captured by the enemy, and 16 men missing.*

As the regiments were falling back Lieutenant-Colonel Chamberlain received notice that both Colonels Holman and Kiddoo were wounded, whereupon he assumed command as senior officer. At about the same moment he received an order from Major-General Weitzel to fall back, which he immediately did, bringing off such wounded as could be found, and covering his retreat with a strong line of skirmishers.

The following officers and men of the First Brigade are deemed worthy of mention for gallant conduction the action: Colonel John H. Holman, First U. S. Colored Troops, the division commander by seniority, but this day in command of the First Brigade, fell seriously wounded within 200 yards of the enemy's works while charging with his line. Whatever may be said of the disorder in the ranks of the Twenty-second, it is but just to say that Colonel J. B. Kiddoo, of the Twenty-second, charged with his right company upon the enemy's works with an utter disregard for his own personal safety until he fell dangerously wounded within fifty yards of the rebel line. Lieutenant Colonel Giles H. Rich, commanding First U. S. Colored Troops, displayed both courage and good judgment in his successful assault upon the enemy's intrenched lines, and in his equally successful retreat when the lack of support and the concentration of the enemy rendered his further stay imprudent. Dr. J. W. Mitchell charged with the commanding officer, Colonel Holman, until he fell. All the officers of the division staff who accompanied Colonel Holman performed their duties gallantly and faithfully. Captain Henry Ward, First U. S. Colored Troops, displayed the greatest gallantry in remaining with a handful of men in the enemy's works, endeavoring to extricate the captured guns from the killed and wounded horses, in which endeavor he was captured. Captain Albert Janes, Twenty-second U. S. Colored Troops, displayed great coolness, intrepidity, and skill in carrying his company at double-quick within five yards of the enemy's lines, while the rest of his regiment was in disorder, and in covering the rear of his regiment in its retreat. First Sergt. John Loveday, Company A, Twenty-second U. S. Colored
