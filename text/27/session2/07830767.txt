GRAHAM ?ndBUCHAN4Nsuppirted th s view
of ihe sub ect.
The darger of epening -> >"ew 'oor to e'a ins
on the pension li^t was pbly urged by Mes«rn
WFIGHT and CALHOUN They contend-
ed that no  such construction  should   be  given
767
to the law of 1838, as that it was intended to ex-
tend to cases of this kind.
It appealed tba1 the permanent pension law of
1836 was intended to be for the benefit of widows
of revolutionaiy solaier , marr ed at the lime of
the revolutionary war, m consideration of tbe hard-
ships they endured, or the services they rendered,
by taking caie oí those soldiers ard their families,
while their own time was taken up in the service of
the country
The pension law of 1838 was intended to extend
ihj oenehi^ of the pension bst to v.iJoas married
to revolutionaiy s^Hier- after the revolutionary
war, but prur to 1794, <n the ground that those
who mar led those veterans at «>n advanced age
were en itird (0 their pension'-, in consideration of
the caie and attention necessarily bestowed upon
their declining years.
The recent practice of Congress bad been to ex-
tend th" beiiffii of this law to widows of thoss
re-volutionary sold ers claiming un'-r the law of
1833, to c«ses in which thoss widows married
again.
Mrs Besly's was one of the latter etas'-; and it
w?1 urged upon the two grounds—first, of hei ease
being originally one comma: strictly within the pio-
visions ot the law of 1838; and, nexi, as being
grounde 1 on a principle, with regird to subiequent
maniage, fully sanctioned by precedent in the
action of Congress beretoft>re.
Mr. CALHOUN showed that enormous evil-?
had grown up eut of s i?ll begir-nincs. When he
was at the head ot il t. War Department, the pen
sion system was urs" 1 with assurances that the
u'tmae cist vrould 1 ot exceed $100 000. The
ver, li'ges conjecture was $300,01)0. Yet, in the
ft tyei.t Jut it went mto opera'ion, the demancs
upon that fund exceden two milhons of dollars.
So it virfi \tm!i theliw of 1838. It v/as «aid there
were but few cases, and, in all, they would not
exceed a few thousand Yet, now, they were
running up to hundreds of thousands of dollars,
and if tins new clas-- of ca„cs were added, there
would oj no knowmg w'isic the system would end.
Mr K1N3 concurred in Mr Cslhoon*s view of
ihe subject, and contended 'hat the law of 1838
could not justify t Jts extension Ii v ould be open-
ing a wide door w an innumerable host 01 claim-
an£<;.
Mr. SMITH of Connecticut thought the law
was miended to embrace cases oí this kind.
Ti-e bill was reported fo the faénate, and read a
third tunc, and, the yeai and nays bemg called on
