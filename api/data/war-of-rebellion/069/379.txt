Major-General HANCOCK:

General Barlow reports he has driven the enemy from his front, occupying their rifle-pits, and compelling him to withdraw all their guns but one, which he is now advancing on. Should this be the case, you will advance your line so as to press closely the enemy, and ascertain the new position to which he has retired. You will notify Generals Burnside and Wright of any advance you may make, so that they can advance in conjunction, and should you require additional forces in your operations General Wright has surplus troops, which he will be directed to furnish on requisition.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

General HUMPHREYS:

Notify Generals Burnside and Wright of the above dispatch to Hancock, and send them instructions in conformity therewith.
