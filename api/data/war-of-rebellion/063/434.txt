Brigadier General A. J. SMITH,

Commanding Detachment 16th and 17th Army Corps:

SIR: I am directed by the commanding general to inform you that the right of our line is in force beyond Winn's plantation, and that our pickets are about 2 miles farther on the same road, and if your

left is all right, that in going beyond the pickets it will be necessary for you to look out for your own right.

I have the honor to be very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. DWIGHT,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

P. S. - Will you please to send me word how much forage there is immediately inside your lines that can be loaded to-night? We need forage greatly. The train came back to-day nearly empty. I want to start another train at once.

HDQRS. DETACHMENT 16TH AND 17TH ARMY CORPS,Moore's Plantation, May 4, 1864-11.20 a.m.

Brigadier-General DWIGHT,

Chief of Staff:

Unless you send me some cavalry, that we may know what we have to contend with, I had better retire to my boats. What is cavalry for but to reconnoiter in front of our lines?]

I must order up Colonel Lynch, commanding my First Brigade, and he must be replaced by other troops. The force of the enemy is variously estimated, occupying the south side of Bayou Robert.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. J. SMITH,

Brigadier-General.
