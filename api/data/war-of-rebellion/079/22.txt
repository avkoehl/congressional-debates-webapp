Major B. H. POLK:

Another courier from my scouting party on Cornersville pike received, confirming first information, but saying in addition that he, Forrest, had not artillery with him; thinks he has adivded his force. Courier just in from scouting party Fayetteville pike reports Forrest moving westward, which confirms Cornersville report so far. I send above for what it is worth. Small parties on road above me. Have sent out to drive them away. Report received from Athens that our forces are again in possession of that place. Report as to Forrest is from lieutenant in command of party. I send this as it is received.

This news seems to confirm las dispatch that enemy had divided his forces, as entire force being at Fayetteville is a supposition of courier.
