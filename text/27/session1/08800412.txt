tea and coffee, the solace of the poor, upon coarse
wool and linens, hitherto free, and upon blanket*
under the value of seventy-five cents at the place
■whence exported—articles which supply warmth
and clothing to the laboring man and his family,
while amber, anmseed, and tamarinds, furs of all
kinds undressed, epaulettes and wings of gold or
silver, fustic, raw hides, and India rubber, are ad-
mitted free' It continues to impose a duty of two
and a half cents per pound upon brown sugar, ten
cents per bushel upon ¡.alt, and five cents per gallon
upon molasses, while pearls of all kinds not set,
gems and precious stones, burr stones unwrought,
busts of marble, bron2e, alabaster, and plaster of
Paris, dye wood, specimens of natural hrstory,
plants, trees, and strings for musical instrument^,
are required to pay nothing at the custom house
Knitting needles are made to pay a duty of twenty-
five per cent, at the same time that ivory, hair
pencils, and tortoise shells are admitted without
charge The blacksmith is required to pay two
and a half cents a pound upon his hammers and
sledges, thefarmer thuty per cent ad valoremwpon
his scythes, cutting knives, reaping hooks, spades,
and sickles, while gold and silverand other watches
and parts of watches, gold and silver lace, em-
broidery, jewelry, and all articles composed wholly
or chiefly of gold or silver, are continued at the
moderate rate of twelve anda half percent Thus,
while such articles, some oí which can scarcely be
called luxuries even, but objects of pride and vanity,
and which are almost exclusively employed by the
rich and fashionable, are left at a low rate or en-
tirely free of duty,—the necessary comforts of life,
which are consumed by the people at large, and
are essential, at least, to their comfoit and well
being, are taxed at the exorbitant rate of from
one fifth to one half their cost Is this your much
vaunted reform i Is this the " relief" that was pro
raised the people i Is this the "entertainment to
which we were invited v' Sir, my constituents, at
least, will scorn such íeform,—will repel «ueh re-
lief,—will reject such entertainment If this be
not " rasping the marrowless bpnes of famine for
tribute," it is, at least, grinding the faces of the
poor, and " taking from the mouth of labor the bread
which it has earned "
But let us scrutinize some of these items more close
ly,—how the grati fication of the rich has been st udied
at the expense of the comforts of the poor The rich
man decks his halls with busts of marble, bronze,
or alabaster, these are free His delicate lady
adorns her person with pearls and precious stones,
these also are free Their grounds are ornamented
with exotic trees and shrubs , these, too, are free
While the poor man pays a tax of one fifth upon
the coffee, tea, linens, coarse wool, and blankets, con-
sumed by himself, his wife and his children The
miller obtains the material for his burr stones free,
while the blacksmith pajs two and a half cents a
pound upon his «ledge and hammer Is there no
injustice in exempting India rubber, which is worn
by the few as a covering and shield against the
ram, while blankets, coarse wool, and linens, are
so heavily taxed ' Some of these discriminations
would be amusing, if they would not be harsh and
odious Strings for musical instruments are free
by this bill To what do they owe this exemption i
Is J, in honoi of the Tippecanoe songs and hard
cider melodies, to the effect of which ihey contnb
uted dunngthela'e musical canvass i Whyshould
a preference be given to fiddle strings over tea and
coffee, linens coarse wool, and blankets'! Is a
fiddler more worthy of government bounty than a
farmer or laborer i
You will pardon me, I hope Mr Chairman,
for harping a moment upon these fiddle strings,
but it does seem so ineffably absurd, as well as tin
just, to exempt such neceisaiies of life from taxa
tion, while those luxuries, tea, coffee, linens, coarse
•nool, and blankets, are lo be clipped and taxed to
a fifth of their value, that I cannot repress a min-
gled feeling of ridicule and indignation
Let me illustrate the operation of this bill by a
familiar example A fine lady rides out in her
splendid coach, plated with gold and snver (which
latter materials were imported free of duly)
adorned with gems of various kinds, enjoying a
similar exemption, and enveloped in costh furs-
worn for show, not warmth—which have also
paid nothing at the customhouse, she conde
scends, m cuuosity or kindness, to visit the cabin
of the laboring man where she sees his u lfe, pre-
paring the simple clothing of hei family from ma
tenals which have been taxed twenty per cent ,
while a sick child, perhaps, reposes upon a blanket
which has been taxed to the same amount, and
the good man himself, oppressed Tilth his useful
toil, is returning from the field with his sickle,
which has been taxed thirty per cent, to regale
himself with a bowl of coffee, which has also
paid a tax of one fifth its value Mr Chair-
man, the great body of my constituents—the hon-
est, intelligent, and independent farmers and me
chames of the west—for whom a kind Providence
has converted into a blessing the primeval curse,
"m the sweat of thy brow shalt thou eat thy
bread"—want no such "relief" as that now offered
to them by the Secretary of the Treasury and his
honorable compeer or representative on this floor
They desire rather to be let alone—to be permitted
to enjoy in peace, untaxed, and at a reasonable
cost, their accustomed "luxuries" of tea and cof
fee, sugar, salt, linens, coarse wool, and blankets,
which they would not exchange for all the bank
loans, national debts, and tariffs, which are prepar-
lngforthem by this most economical administration,
which came into power upon the cry of "reform
and retrenchment," and which promised to do so
much for the relief of a suffering people They
want no such change as this
And for whose benefit is this measure really in
tended 1 For the benefit of the speculators and
stockjobbers, at home and abroad, whose corpora
tions and stocks are to be once more bolstered up
by the distribution of the proceeds of the public
lands For their relief we are to give away four
or five millions annually, and then supply the de
ficiency by taxing the essential comfort1; of the
people at large neatly twice the amount All this
is in character with a party which, from the be
ginning, has been utterly devoid oí populat sym
pathies and feelings The bowels of our present
rulers yearn with compassion for the "sufferings '
of Wall street and the London Exchange alone
The tea, the coffee, the clothing, the very bed of
the laboring poor throughout our wide country,
are to be taxed millions upon millions, to swell
the coffers of the purchasers and dealers m State
and corporation stocks at ruinous discounts The
usurer, the speculator, the banker,—the Biddies,
the Barings, and the Rothschilds—must be "re-
lieved" by curtailing the necessary comforts of the
great body of the people who fell the forest and
plough the field, who sow and reap, but are not
permitted to enjoy the harvest Truly has it been
said that the borrower is the slave of the lender
We aie lettered with bonds—we arc in the slocks
Our millionary masters abroad come here in per-
son, or by their agents, and demand this sacrifice
more imperiously than if they had conquered us
by the sword They look down iiom those gal-
leries—they walk these halls—they address then
imperious mandates to the Chief Magistrate of
the republic, and dicate terms to your Secretary
of State, as though he were their regular attorney
They hover like buds of evil omen, they perch
like cormorants upon the tree of life, they pounce
like harpies upon the bountiful feast which a kind
Providence has spread throughout this fair land
To what a humiliating condition are we reduced
This bill to curtail the necessary comforts and in
nocent enjoyments of every man, woman, and
child in the country but more especia'ly those
who rest from their labors but one day in seven,
is a degrading tribute to those who have not an
American interest or feeling To give to such as
these some four or five millions perannnm, our peo
pie are to be ta^ed to nearly double the amount—as
much is wasted by the process of transition The
sovereign States are made humble tributaries to
the central Federal power, and the proper eqmlib
rmm between the States and the General Govern-
ment is «enously disturbed Under every aspect
this bill is thoroughly bad It is unnecessaiy, it
is sought to be justified by false pretences it is
wrong in principle , it is absurd m detail it is un
just and oppressive in its discriminations it is a
disguised tribute to the holders of deprecated
stocks and bonds
Mr Chairman, let us not turn a deaf ear to the
warning voice of history The attempt of Lord
North to impose a tax of only three pence a pound
upon tea, to obtain an obnoxious principle, and to
pamper an arrogant oligarchy contributed mainly
to that revolution, by virtue of which we are enabled
to sit here in council, the representatives of a great
and free people That people must have dwindled
in spirit as much as they ha^e grown in stature, if
they are now resigned to pay the tribute of a tithe-
nay, more, a fifth—upon their tea and coffee, their
linens, wool, and blankets, and other necessary
comforts and conveniences, to feed the ravenous
maw of speculators in banks and loans, and to
squander the proceeds of our national domain upon
the stockjobbers of Wall street, and the loan mon
gers of London We are already m the full tide of
these hazardous experiments We have voted a
loan oí twelve millions of dollars, and we are told
that that amount will scarcely suffice Should we
pass the proposed bank bill, some ten (probably six-
teen) millions more must be borrowed, which will
have to be provided for sooner or later, principal
and interest, for it must be obvious to all that the
day of safe and profitable bank ng is past Thus
we go The morbid appetite of federal ism was too
keen to wait for a regular session of Congress
An extraordinary session must be called to build
up, m hot haste, this complicated fabric of debt,
bank, and tanff The " relief" bill before us is but
a foretaste of what is m store for us At this rate,
the Federal Government will soon, envy the condi-
tion oí the most embarrassed among the States'
I know that my humble efforts will avail but little
against the mandate that has gone forth, both abroad
and at home But I felt it my duty to remonstrate
for myself and my constituents, humbly, yet earnest-
ly, against this measure of an administration so dis-
tinguished for economy, retrenchment, and reform,
which redeems its pledges to relie ve a " suffering
people," andmake "better times," by taxing heavily
those luxuries, tea, coffee, salt, brown sugar, molas-
ses, linens, coarse wool, and blankets, while it ex-
empts from fibute such necessaries of life as marble
busts, furs, epauletts of gold and silver, amber,
India rubber, pearls, gems, and precious stones.
NOTE
Among various othei articles, the bill under con-
sideration proposes to levy a duty of 20 per cent ad
valorem, upon tea, coffee, pepper, linens, sheetings,
and wool under 8 cents per pound, which are now
entirely fref , and upon woollen blankets not ex-
ceeding m value 75 cents each, which at present
pay only 5 per cent Of these articles, there were
imported into the United States in the year 1840

which being taken as the average annual consump-
tion, there is to be nearly four millions of dollars
raised every year from this source alone But this
is not all that is paid by the consumer This duty
is paid by the importer, and becomes a part of the
original cost of the article, upon which the whole-
sale dealer, the merchant, and various retailers,
charge the same advance that is imposed on any
other part of their investments, and which is
not less than 33| per cent , so that, instead of
13,901,759 GO, the consumers—the people, chiely
the laboring people—actually pay upon these arti-
cles an annual tax of 15,203,268 80, but about three
and a half millions of which reach the Treasury,
if we deduct 10 per cent for the expenses of collec-
tion To enable the General Government, then, to
distribute gratuitously three and a half millions of
dollars among corporations and bankers, the people
are to pay an annual tvx of $5,2,268 8020"'
REMARKS  OF MR.   WISE,
OF VIRGINIA
In the House of Representatives, August 6, 1841—
On the bill "to incorporate the subscribers to
the Fiscal Bank of the United Slates," delivered
in the House of Representatives, m Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union
Mr Marshall of Kentucky having concluded
his remarks on the 16th section of the bill—
Mr WISE rose and said Mr Chairman, the
main part of my work ¡s done, and done much bet-
ter than I could have done it myself. The gentle-
man who has just concluded—to use the language
of his own cimphment to me on the Distribution
bill—has raked this comprmnise 16 h section from
stem to siern; he has left neuher spars, nor rigging,
nor hulk ' It will be hardly necessary for me to
I suiyey the wreck of that part of this bill which his
