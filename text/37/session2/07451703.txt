Mr. EDWARDS. 1 do not propose to address
the committee upon this subject m any elaborate
or prepdied speech. I should he prevented from
doing so, if for no other ieason, by the seeming
inattention of almost all present to a subject ot
even the vast magnitude of the one now under con-
sideration, and which is to be submitted to thou*de-
termination. But, sir, I am unwilling that it should
seem here that the Westonly, the extreme West,
or even the great Northwest, or all combined, are
alone interested in this great subject.
Sir, it concerns the East as much as it does the
West. And although the discussion has been con-
fined thus far to the gentlemen from the western
portion of the country, I desire itto be understood
that this subject has the interest of the East, and
has attracted thcattention of the East, as much as
of the West, and that when the proper time shall
come, and now, if it is the proper time, there will
be a full cooperation on the part of the East to
carry through this great national work that is to
have so important tin influence upon the future of
this nation.
It is too late in the day for any gentleman to
undertake to interest the House by attempting to
demonstrate the importance of this great connec-
tion between the Atlantic and Pacific shores. Its
importance is too obvious to make it necessary or
proper for any gentleman to enlarge upon it in its
details. And, sir, it is not only important, but, if
not already, is fast becoming a necessity, and an
increasing, a growing necessity which will soon
demand the application of the resources of the
nation for its accomplishment if now delayed. It
has become evident to all that this f>reat railway
connection between the East and West is only a
question of time. We all know that the commu-
nication between these twogieat extremes is now
very circuitous; that it is indirect; that the inter-
vening space can be traversed only by a large con-
sumption of time. We all know that as the At-
lantic coast is already fringed and bordered by
cities, by population, and wealth, sustained by a
bieadth of interior country which time has gradu-
ally enlarged and improved by settlement and cul-
tivation, and that the Pacific coast is becoming so
fringed and bordered, and with much more rapid-
ity than the Atlantic has been, by like population
and wealth, by cities cm the coast, and by towns
and villages and settlements in the interim*. We
all know that by the wealth of that country, buried
in the bosom of the earth, it is growing in inipoi t-
ancc with a rapidity unexampled m the histoiy of
nations.
And we know another fact, that between these
two broad margins of population and wealth—the
eastern and the western—there is an almostdesert
region of country, much of which will be exceed-
ingly slow of settlement, presenting few induce-
ments at piesent, oven to the hardy and restleiss
pioneer. It presents a dividing district, as it were
—a baniei, almost—against the intercourse be-
tween what are, to lie the two great lines of pop-
ulation, of wealth, and commercial importance of
the country.
It is to be the office of this Pacific railroad, when
it shall be constructed, to overleap that barrier;
to annihilate, almost, the distance between them,
so that it will beof slight importance that they are
separated by the space that intervenes.
Now, sir, it is in tins point of view that this
work is important, and it is m this point of view
that it is necessary. It is neeessaiy to the busi-
ness of the countiy thatuthere should be better
facilities for transportation and for the transit of
passengers. It is necessary as a facility for social
and business intercourse, hut I regard it rs of
much more importance in a political point of view.
If this Union is to be preserved, if we are suc-
cessfully to combat the difficulties mound us, if
we are to crush out this rebellion against the law-
ful authority of the Government, and are to have
an entire icstoration, it becomes us, with states-
manlike prudence and sagacity, to look carefully
into the futme, and to guaid in advance against
all possible considerations which may threaten the
dismenibermenr of the country hi reafter. From
the geographie.il face of the country, when the
great region of the distant West shall havegrown
to the size to which it is rapidly tending, when it
shall begin to feel its sense of independence, unless
the relations between the East end the West shall
be the most perfect and most intimate which can
be established—by reason of this vast interior
space of almost uninhabited country winch I have
referred to, the empire will be m danger of break-
ing on the crest of the liocky mountains, and of
xepaiatmg by the weight of Us two sea-girt sec-
tions. Then, sir, m this point of view, for the com-
mercial advantages which it will secure, for the
business relations it will establish and serve, for
the political necessity which exists, and which,
if not now, will soon beimpeiative—lor these rea-
sons, 1 say that the East cannot but look upon j
this project with favoi, and is u:.idy «t the proper j
time to give to it all their eneigy and all -proper I
encouragement and support. j
Mr. THOMAS, of Ma ssachusetts. Let me ask j
the gentleman from New Hampshire a question. |
1 put it to the gentleman whether, in his judgment, I
this is a judicious time to commence this work on
behalf of the country? I would like to have an
answer to the question.
Mr. EDWARDS. I will come to that directly.
It is evident, Mr. Chairman, that this road
never Can be built by private means. It is too
gigantic a work. Experience in this country in
the construction of railroads has dissipated all the
loose notions of profit which at one time were
entertained from every enterprise of the kind which
could be projected, whatever might be its char-
acter, however visionary it may have been in its
inception. The experience of the country has
brought the people of capital down to a sober judg-
mcnton this subject. They are not now prepared
to embark their means in any enterprise which
docs not afford a reasonable, an almost ccrtain,
expectation of a profitable return.
Now, a word in relation to the aid which the
Government should furnish for this work, when
it should be furnished, and the extent to which
it should be furnished. And this brings me to
the consideration of the question addressed to
me by the gentleman from Massachusetts, [Mr.
Tiiomas.] Sir, I would say of all other times for
the last few years this is the time when we should
be less likely to embark in an enterprise which
will call for the resources of thisGovernment than ^
in any other. I have been disposed, representing
a constituency who are economical in all of their
notions and in all their habits, to withhold my
vote thus far during the session from every ap-
propriation which did notsccm to be called for by
the emergencies of the nation. If there was any
amount of money necessary at the outset in this
enterprise, I should consider it for the time a con-
clusive objection to the measure. But by the pro-
visions of either bill no demand is to be made upon
the resources of the country to any considerable
extent for a long time to come, and therefore I
am willing to vote for it if pioperiy perfected.
Other gentlemen in this House will exercise
their own judgment in relation to the eflcctof the
provisions of this measure. I do not think the
condition of the country is conclusive against the
passage of this measure at this time, and the com-
mencement of the road at once. If other gentle-
men think there ought to be further consideration,
and that the uncertainty hanging over the condi-
tion of the country should first be dissipated, they
will vote accordingly. So much in answer to the
gentleman from Massachusetts. For myself, if I
shall be satisfied that a bill shall be perfected
which will be likely to accomplish the purpose,
with no other demands upon the Government than
it shall now authorize, notwithstanding the con-
dition uf the country is as it is, I shall vote for the
bill pledging the credit of the Government to the
amount proposed, and trust to the future. I do
not feel that this Government is to be subverted,
that this nation is at the end of its career. I do
not feel that the great internal improvements ne-
cessary to develop the country and bind it together
are hereafter to be dispensed with. I have no con-
viction that hereafter we are to cease to increase
and prosper as we have done in the past. I be-
lieve that we are yet again to move foiward as a
nation and are destined to reach a state of pros-
perity and power beyond the conception of those
even who are the most sanguine under present
discouragements. 1 shall not be deterred, there-
fore, from aiding in the initiation of this measure
if a bill shall be perfected which is at all certain
to accomplish the purpose.
Now, in relation to the character of the bills
which have been presented. I do not propose to
go into their consideration in detail. 1 think it is
important, befoic the Government shall pledge an
acre of its land or a dollar of its money, that it
should be satisfied that the disposition they may
male*1 of the one and the other will be effectual to
accomplish the object proposed. This should not
be left to uncertainty, nor should we be lured by
any deceptive holding out of any that should be
interested in the execution of this great work into
a committal to contributions hereafter, further than
those now to be stipulated.
From the little experience I have had in these
matters, 1 have found where a work is undertaken,
and where theie is no ability to carry it through,
either by a corporation, or what is still better, a
Government to look to and to lean upon, a public
work of almost any description is quite apt to come
to a stand still at the point where it ceases to be
