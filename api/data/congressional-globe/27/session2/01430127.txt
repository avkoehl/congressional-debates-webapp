rowing money to supply the wants of the Government If they do
not immediately and always pay debts, they at least enable ere
ditors to pay themselves, and enable debtors of the United
States to make them available m the extinguishment 01 all dues,
without the possibility of neglect, denial or delay and they
enable the receivers of them to turn them into money, which
becomes absolute payment m their hands If they do not beai
on their face evidence of having been emitted in letuin, andas
an equivalent for money borrowed, they are at least bene
ficial substitutes foi the usual evidence oí a direct and posi
live loan
In successive legislative provisions for them they are de
claredtobe tor both, puiposes, and havebeen, in effect, conti
nuallyso applied Shortly aftei the declaration of war with
England—on the 30th June, 1842—when Mi Madison was
President, and Mr G.llatm Secietaiy of the Treasury, they
commenced their caieer, and through succeeding Adrmmstia
tions they have maintained then occasional existence The
act of the 12th Octobei, 1837, in like mannei descubes their
puiposes and gives them then destination But three statutes
carefully pr  tect the citizen from any thing but a voluntary
acceptance of them It is a mure, hydra ot the fancy to sup
pose that they lie, weie, or evercan be, foiced upon the credi
tor He is not oppressed oi tyrannized ovei by having the option
presented to him of an available security of j erp'-fuallym
ceasing value, oi the empty andunieal sa tstaction ol a sha
dowy credit which may be deferred untitles hopes shall sicken
in repeated disappoirtment
Their constitutional character his been recognised and their
true appellation nas been given by high judicial authority
Judge story pronounced them m 1819 to be a lü^al tender of
debts due to the United States He seems to have regarded
them as a contiact between tht citizens and the Government for
every purpose of positive liability and incidental currency
The Supreme Couit, in a íeccnt case, in 1839, when the penal
consequences of the decision required a strict con&ttuction of
the statutes, called them promissory note*, and determined
that they weie ploperly described as such in the indictment
And so they are, to every possible intent, the } íomiasory notes
of a firm, whose credit oneeit would have been disloyalty to
doubt The Governmentbeirg indebted acknowledges itsobli
gallon to pay, places in the hands of Us meritorious cicditoi
not only proofs, nieiiagable, to =erve if othei evidence should
fail him, but a negotiable instrument, the tiansfei of which
may materially avail both the original holder a& uieheveshis
immediate wants, and the subsequent piopuetor as he invents
his money at afairmteiest, not only duang the appaient life
of the note, but after its brief nominal duiauon has e ded Nei

Jar use, has limited tht constitutionality of these issues to any
particular object On the tontraiy, then character as currency
is stamped upon the face of them They aie negotiable like
any oth-ei promissory notes, and rendeiel transferable by de

wisdom "Our country, right oi wrong," was once a sentiment
that thrilled in every eai, and burned m eveiy bosom It she
is in danger, let us buckle on our armor, and come manfully
and unitedly to the rescue, not count the cost of her redemption,
or calculate the items of expenditure by which she has been
brought into jeopardy If her money be exhausted, ard even

as the immediate jewel of our souls— let us preserve her honor

But the accuracy of the inference of the Secretary shall be

the two things go into the market together If the loan can he

Mr GILMER renewed the motion to strike out the enacting
clause of the bill which opening the whole subject for debate,
Mr G proceeded to a Idress the committee
He said u was far fiom his pmpose to hmdei or delay the
passage ot this bill he desired but to submit a few facts and
con«ideiations which ought tobe legaided befoie it passed in
stating the e he should confine himseli strictly to the merits
of the question before the committee He would, in the first
pl&ce read by way of argument aid as a pait of his «speech an
amendment which he designed to offer when it «hould heieafter
be m ordei to uoso
The amendment, as it met the ear of the Reporter, was
this to stnk" out the proviso in the bill, and to insert the
liiloAing í'ioviued, that the lieasuiv notes i=sned under
the mfhor ty of this bill shall be deemed and taken to be ¡i
lie j of an equal amount of the loan authorized by the law of
July, 1841

Deduct fiom  thi& seven millions of Treasury notes, to be to
deemed withm the fiscal year,  and it still  ]eft a debt of

Now, he asked the committee to pause a moment. Without
comparing this Treasury estimate oí thirty two millions for the
public expenditures of the present year, with the estimates of
foimer years, or with the exhausted slate of the Treasury, he
would ask the committee to look at a few of the items whicti
went to compose the amount
In the civil list, as compared with last year, there appeared to
bean increase ol &3jO,O0O, of which §150¡000 were for carrying
into effect the Bankrupt law This, he hoped, might be saved.
The aggregate for the civil list, last year, had been $4,615 363
But io this amount were embraced a number of «ems which
would not recur during the present year, or for years to come.
Ore was the expense of the 6th Census, another was for the
survey of the Boundary line of lexas, another for the survey of
the Northeastern Boundary, making, m all, $744,3^0 Thus
was to be deducted
Ihe chief increase occurred in the estimates for the military
and naval estalil shmenta Mi Q would not go into the esti-
mates foi íoitificu ions, but would look at the enormous item
of $1 565 359 for works of internal improvement If he mis-
took not, many ot the&c objects had been submitted at the ex-
trafeeataitm, the Chairman would remember how they fared.
Mr G could not g(f*for them now This appropriation of o\er
a million and a half was not asked at> a war neasure, and asa
peace measure it could not meet with his support
Sir G next looked at the estimates foi the Navy Last year
these amounted to ©4,229,986, thisyearto 88,203,287 bemgan
increase of &3076 00, ncaily fourmilhons
[H re some explanations took piare between Mr  Sa&ton-
si all and Mi Gilmí-r ,   the tormer correcting s.ome of /ins
statements, and the latter insisting upon and defending them ]
On the whole there was an aggregate increase of estimated
expenditures to the amount of about seven millions
Waiving all purpose of going into any discussi&n as to-the
propuety of these estimates he glanced at them merely with a
view to show the pie&ent wants, of the Tieasury
Í et it not be «aid that, m these expenditures were unavoida-
ble^ ley must now be provided for That was not the state of
the mater, these amounts weie estimates merely, they had
yetti oe fcubmitted to t^e action of the appiopnatc committees,
yet Congieso weie indirectly cillcdon to meet them madvance.
It was not yet ceitain they would be neuded at all events, it
was uotnece<-aary to meet the whole amoui t now If the com
rnittees^bould sancti m them by then iepoit% it would betune
enough then to pio\ide for them lie was not himself satisfied
of the necessity ol m my of the items And aa it might turn out
that they were not necessar), he thought there was no necessity
of nioviding foi over «ixdnd a hall millions, the balance of the
loan     So lai he was leatly to go

would stand in need of a loan of twel/e millions exclusive of
