Brigadier General J. S. MARMADUKE,

Commanding Fourth Division:

GENERAL: General Hindman directs that you that position as soon as possible so as to cover his entire front, from the Huntsville road toward the left, far into the Indian country. He is satisfied that the squadron under Dobbin is doing no good, and wishes to relieve it as soon as possible. He desires, therefore, that as soon as you get into position, and post your pickets suitably, you report the fact to him immediately, that he may withdraw that squadron.

Respectfully,

R. C. NEWTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Lieutenant General T. H. HOLMES,

Commanding, &amp;c., Little Rock, Ark.:

GENERAL: I have received your letter of the 25th ultimo in reference to the urgent need of money for your command, In addition to the sum $4,888,567 carried out by Major Carr, the sum $2,500,000 was sent to him in charge of a special agent, who left this city on October 16, and had not reached your headquarters at the date of your letter. It is hoped that these amounts will be sufficient to meet the most pressing claims, and if more funds are necessary you are requested to forward estimates made out by bonded officers, as no money can legally be paid from the Treasury to any others. The sums mentioned above do not include $1,132,393 lately sent to the quartermaster of General Pike's command. The Quartermaster-General reports that in no instance has the reasonable estimate of any bounded quartermaster been received and not acted on the same day it reached his office.

Your obedient servant,

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.
