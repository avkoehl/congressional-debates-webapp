25th Cong....3d Sess.                     Bonds of United States Bank—Mr. Wright.                                           Senate.
merits made at stipulated places in the South and
West, in stipulated amountsat each place, and to
draw but about five hundred thousand dollars
monthly from this source, upon the condition that
the Secretary of theTreasury should consent to the
arrangement, that hesupposed the matter was sub-
sequently submitted to the Secretary of theTreas-
ury, and concuired in by him, and he now thinks
the agent of the bank closed the contract for the
puichase of the bond with this understanding, and
that the successful tei mination of that negotiation,
in a great measure, depended upon that collateral
arrangement He also expiesseshis full convic
tion of the necessity of the sale of this bond for
the successful prosecution of the affairs of Govern-
ment intrusted to his charge, " on which, at that
particular period, the peace and character ot the
country so essentially depended "
Not a Senator in these seats can, for a moment,
mistake the important and delicate interests to
which the Secietary of war refeis, in using this
language. None here can forget the intense in-
terest felt throughout the whole country in the
successful removal of the numerous and powerful
tribes of Indians from the South and Southwest-
ern States None here aie ignormt of the vast
sums of money the Government had stipulated
to pay to extinguish the title of these Indians to
their lands within the States, to pay the expenses
of their removal, and to subsist them at their
new homes, and none,anywhcie, who knowany-
thmg of the Indian chainctei, can be ignoiant of
the necessity of having, atthe moment, the money
stipulated to be paid to 01 foi him If money
is due to the Indian, he must have money, and
he must have it when you have stipulated to pay
it, oi youi business ttansactions with him are at
an end You cannot tell him of embanassments
or disappointments You cannot talk to him of
ciedit, beyond the letter of youi bond, and retain
his confidence. Who, then, will be surpused at
the anxiety manifested, and the lesponsibrhty
assumed by the Secretmy of War to secure, by
the sale of this bond, the requisite funds in the
Treasuiy to accomplish that complete íemov ll of
these gieat tribes which has been accomplished
during the past ycai, and which does, and will,
leflect so much honoi upon thatcapablc and per-
severing public sovant'
I am uwaie that some of the e nuspondtnee
would seem to imply some misundi tstuiding be-
tween the Secretin ics of the Ireastuy and of
War, ni íelation to this coll Ut nil ai i unburn nt as
applied to the proceeds o' thetlmd bond, and the
coiicaponduico lenders it moie than piobable
that the one or the other had luboicd undo a
misapprehension, and had rnteipietcd vcibil con-
veisations, intended to be applied to the mode
and manno of payment of the thud bond, as. re-
lating to the mode and manilo oí making the
anticipated payrm nts upon the second bond
Still the i icts show that the igent of the bank
made these stipulations i ssential to the tlosmg of
Ins contract in both ciscs, and tint lie was
authoii/ed to believe tint thev weie undcistood
by all the pur ties to romtitulc a component pait
of that (.ontiact Ih faets al¡>o show that the
money to be deuved liom both tit gotiations was
indispensable to the Ilea1 tliful operations of the
public Ticasmy, while national intocsts ot the
gravest chaiacto depended u¡ on the ability of
theTieasuiy to ledtem the plighted faith of the
country.
What, then, 1 ask, Mr Piesident, with some
confidence, is the judgment to be icndeied upon
these transactions' Are the executive offieos of
the country to be censuied and condemned for
having entered into any negotiations with tins
bank m lelatmn to the payment of these bonds,
and the supply of an exhausted Treasury fiom
that souice' And, if so, upon what giound'
Had Mr Woodbuiy said to Mr. Biddle, " I, sir,
am opposed to youi bank, the political party to
which I belong, and with which 1 act and feel,
aie strongly opposed to it, and I will not, theie-
foie, negotiate with you about your bonds. I
•wnl not sell to you upon any terms, be the con-
sequences what they may My political hostility,
and the hostility of my political paity, forbid
that I should have any business transaction with
you"—had out Secretaiy of the Tieasury taken
this course, and failed to lealize the money upon
the bonds, in time to meet the calls upon the
Treasury, as in that event he must, and had we
returned here and found the Creeks and Chero-
kees not removed from Georgia, Alabama, and
Tennessee; the military force withdrawn from
Florida for want of subsistence; the western and
northern frontiers unguarded, and the public
works abandoned, what would have been the
public judgment upon the conduct of the Secre-
tary then' What would have been the judgment
of this body' Who then would have stood up
here to defend the conduct of the Secretary of the
Treasuiy, and who to accuse and condemn him'
Sir, so bioad and untenable ground as this will
riot be assumed, but it may be said that the in-
formal and collateral understanding to which the
Secretary of War was a party, has vitiated the
transactions, and gives cause for censure. Let us,
for a moment, look at the facts. The money
could be realized upon the bonds, in time to meet
the wants of the Treasury, from no other quarter
than this bank. It could not be realized from the
bank but by consenting to these collateral ar-
íangements as to the times, places, and manner
of payment The money was to be placed in the
bank, " in special deposit," to the ciedit of the
Treasurer, and it was so placed Upon the
stiength of this deposit the Tieasurer was to draw
his diafts for the public disbursements, in stipu-
lated amounts, and make them payable at stipu-
lated places, and, without piesentment at the
bank, it was to pay them at those places " 2it
specie 01 its equivalent," and there is no allegation
that they weie not so paid The places oí pay-
ment were named by the heads of the Depait-
ments which had the superintendence of the dis-
bursements, as weie also the sums to be paid at
each, and both with a strict reference to the wants
and convenience of the public service, and it has
not been asserted that inconvenience 01 loss arose
to that seivice fiom either, while the contraiy is
positively shown by both the reports under con-
sideration The negotiation for the sale of the
thud bond was closed, and the money paid, on
the 1st of August, and that foi the payment of the
second bond,and the fust installment pud, on the
15th of the same month On the 13th, two days
befoio the last payment mentioned, the bank íe
surntd specie payments, so that, howevei much
these negotiations may have contributed to that
highly dt suable result, the bank became a specie-
paying bank befoie a single draft upon the monev
in deposit to the ciedit of the Tieasuro could
have passed fiom the hands of the ofiheis and
agents of the Government, if any such diafts had
been diawn at that period
These arc the fac ts, and would they have jus-
tified the Secietaiy of the Tteasuiy, even sup
posing him to have known and assented to the
collateral stipulations as to the manner of pay-
ment foi the bond sold, in íefusmg to accept the
teuns oileied by the bank, and thus to have in-
clined the consequences to which I have befoie
alluded' I think not, Mi President. But, as
my tisk in reference to this pait of the connec-
tion between the Government and the Pernisyl
vania bank is perfoimed, as I have recounted the
ficts and the history of ihe transactions, I know
tediously but i hope faithfully, I cheerfully leave
the Secietaiy of the Tieasury, and all the other
actois in them, to the udgmentof the Senate and
the country If condemnation is to follow, I
only desire that the judgment may rest upon the
truth, and that I have attempted to exhibit.
Another connection has been formed between
the Government and this bank, which is repre-
sented as still more alaimmg and ominous than
the one fiom which we have just passed I con-
giatulate the Senate, and ceitamly myself, that
the facts, in this latter case, are concise, simple,
and plain I piopose, therefore, to lead them all
to the Senate, fust seeing out of what relations
they have ansen
The Bank of Kentucky was one of the deposit
banks, under the law ot 1836, " to íegulate the
depositsof the public money " It, with almost all
the bankinginstitutionsof the country,suspended
specie payments in May, 1837, then having a
very laige amount of the public money in its
hands, for winch it could not account aceoidmg
to law This bank availed itself of the provisions
of the law of the extra session of Congiess of
1837, granting time for payment to the deposit
banks at their option, and gave bonds to secure
the payment of the amount due from it to the
Treasuiy in thiee equal installments; the first to
be paid on the 1st day of July, 1838, the second
on the 1st day of January, 1839, and the thud
on the 1st day of July, 1839, with six per cent
inteiest The installment due in Julv, 1838, was
paid, and nothing more was due upon the bonds
until the 1st day of the present month. Still,
under date of the 5th day of September, 1838,
the Presrdent of the bank wrote to the Secretaiy
of the Treasury, as follows
" I shall, during the course of the present weMt remit to
vou a check on Philadelphia for $3011,000, m part payment
of the debt due liy this bank '
Under date of the 30th September, the Presi-
dent of the bank again wntes from Louisville,
Kentucky, to the Secretary, in the following
words:
" Slit I hand you, inclosed Herewith, a check on the
Bank of the United States, Philadelphia, in your favor, for
S300,000, intended as a payment on the amount due the
Treasurer of the United States by this bank "
On the 17th day of September, McClmtock
Young, the chief clerk m the Treasuiy Depart-
ment, and, at the time, acting as Secietary of
the Treasury, dunng a temporaty absence of
the Secretary, acknowledges the receipt of the
check mentioned in the above note from the Pres-
ident of the Bank of Kentucky, in the following
language:
' Sir I have to acknowledge the receipt of your letter
of the 10th, with its rnclosure I have specially dueeted
the check for ^300,000, drawn by your cashier upon the
Bank of the United Stue^, in favor of JLevi Woodbury,
Secretary of the Tieasui v, to be placed to the special credit
of the Treasurer ot ttie United States, with whom all ac
counts aie kepi, and to whom all payments or transfers of
balances of that kind should be made Whether the bank
will eomidf r my indorsement suíñerent for that purpose,
remains to be seen "
On the same day Mr. Young, acting in the
same chaiacter, writes to the cashier of the Bank
of the United States of Pennsylvania, at Phila-
delphia, as follows-
" Sir The inclosed check has this day been received
from the Bank of Iventueky , and I will thank you to place
tlie uuoiint (S300 000) to ihe special credit of the Irtas
uier, md icknowledge the íeceipt of the «urn to him "
The request of Mi Young was complied with
by the bank, and the amount of the check placed
to the special credit of the Freasurei of the Uni-
ted Slates upon its books These are all the facts
in this case, and fiom them some see a most dan-
gei ous and alar mmg evidence of a disposition oil
the part of the executive officers of the Government
to leunite theTreasuiy of thecountryto this bank-
ing institution, in its new character of a State
bank Is such a conclusion fanly deducible from
the piemises ' The Bank of Kentucky was, at
this period, indebted to the United States in the
sum of about six hundred thousand dolíais No
part of the amount was due until the 1st of Jan-
uary, 183D, ana theiefore the officers of the Treas-
ury were not authorized to expect remittances from
tlr it quartei, until the íeceiptof the notice fiom
the President ot the bank of the5thSeptembei In
five days fiom the date of that note, the diaftfol-
lowed, which must have been before the notice
could have reached the Tieasury Department On
tne 17th of September the diaft comes, in theab-
senceof the Secretaiy of the Treasui y It is drawn
p tyable to him in his individual and official name,
and is upon the Pennsylvania bank. Was it wrong
in Mr Young to take a draft upon that bank in
paymentofa debt due to theTreasury, provided it
should be duly honored ' Much as 1 have and do
dislike that institution, I am not prepared to say
that tne offieeis of the Government would be jus-
tified m visiting it with that measure of prosciip-
tion, and I do not suppose any one will pass cen-
suie upon that act Mi Young took the check
and acknowledged its receipt in the language
abovequoted,informing thePiesident of the Bank
of Kentucky that it ought to have been made pay-
able to the .Treasurer, not to " Levi Woodbuiy,
Secretaiy of the Treasu-y," and that he did not
know whether the Pennsylvania bank would con-
sider his indoisement sufficient to wauant the
payment of the amount to the Treasurei He
must send the check to the bank to determine
this point, and he must send it theie foi collec-
tion The bank was then holding a large sum on
deposit to the cred t of the Tieasui er, as the pi o
ceeds of the bonds, and was meeting the drafts of
theTieasuiei for disbursements atagicater num-
