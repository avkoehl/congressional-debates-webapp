Vaughan and old stage roads, and to to halt there. Mackenzie's cavalry is at the crossing of Hatcher's Run at W. Perkins'. Three hundred cavalry are at the junction of Quaker and old stage roads. Have you used any troops of Ayres at that point?

Brevet Major-General WEBB:

I have just received your dispatch dated 7.50 a. m. If I extend my line to the left as far as possible, using both Crawford and Ayres, and the enemy turns my left, what will I have to attack him with?

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

[HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,]

General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

I have withdrawn all of Ayres' troops from that point on the Vaughan road and all of Colonel Walsh's cavalry except 100 men. I have ordered all the trains which were brought over the Rowanty to this side of Gravelly Run.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

Major-General WARREN,

Commanding Fifth Corps:

From deserters and prisoners we learn that the enemy's line runs along the White Oak Ridge road to Boydton plank road, then back on the road to Burgess' Mill, then down Hatcher's Run. Humphreys has possession of Dabney's Mill. Their picket-line is a rifle-pit and was easily taken.

Major-General WEBB:

Your dispatch of 8.40 a. m. (Numbers 3) just received. The information I have received is of the same effect as that you send me. Two deserters report the line immediately in front of General Griffin as what they think a strong one with two lines of obstructions in front. They had a large number of negroes at work upon it yesterday. General Crawford
