HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF EAST TENNESSEE, Knoxville, Tenn., August 26, 1862.

Brigadier General C. L. STEVENSON,Commanding Second Division, Army of East Tennessee:

GENERAL: A duplicate of your communication in relation to re-enforcements was received at a late hour last night. I had already acted upon the first, and have sent you a copy of the orders issued to Colonels Cooke's, Fain's, Palmer's, and Love's commands. Colonel McDowell and Lieutenant-Colonel Allen have been ordered to hold their commands in readiness for active service. Colonel Talbird's regiment is guarding the bridge over the Hiwassee at Charleston under orders from General Bragg. I learned yesterday that Clinton was without a garrison, Major [H. D.] Capers' [Twelfth Georgia] battalion of infantry, of Gracie's brigade, which I supposed there, having been withdrawn, I believe, to Jacksborough. I have ordered Major [W. N.] Reeves with three companies to that post, being the only disposable force I had. No report yet of the strength of Smith's Legion.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. F. BELTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
