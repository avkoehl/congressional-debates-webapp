The material thus obtained is collated in Schedule A, of which the following is a brief summary:

Stationery (approximate)	 ..........	 2,571,299.00

Total................	 ........	 174,368,847.84

Although this is an immense quantity of supplies, it does not cover the full consumption, as many contracts, especial for straw, wood, and coal, call for deliveries "as required;" hence quantities purchased under these contracts are not included in Schedule A, nor are the quantities of forage and fuel purchased on the march included.

The stationery purchased could not be ascertained, and nothing but its approximate cost is stated in the schedule.

To show the operations of a single depot, the reports of General D. H. Rucker, showing issues of the depot of Washington during the war are inclosed, marked B and C, from which it appears that- the issues of that depot from May 1, 1861, to October 1, 1865, were: Corn, 241,633,972 pounds, or 28,883,500 bushels; mixed grain, 19,049,151 pounds, or 432,935 bushels; hay, 982,163,849 pounds or 491,018 tons; straw, 30,681,907, pounds or 15,349 tons; coal, 877,992,141 pounds, or 391,900 tons; wood, 209, 846 cords.
