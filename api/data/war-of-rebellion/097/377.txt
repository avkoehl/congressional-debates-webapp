ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Dispatch on assault received. My men are not arranged so that they can assault at the same time. None of my officers have yet seen the enemy's line on account of swamps and woods and the quicksand, and the only approachable place on their front is reported impracticable as yet for artillery required to open a passage. Men are hard at work; loss pretty severe to-day.

E. O. C. ORD.

General U. S. GRANT:

A boy, one of General Sheridan's scouts, who was captured on the Chickahominy and escaped from the enemy yesterday morning, reports that the enemy had at Stony Creek, near Dinwiddie Court-House, two brigades of cavalry, one of infantry, and two pieces of artillery.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Dabney's Mills:

General Mackenzie reports that the trains he has been guarding with his cavalry command have crossed the creek, and there is no apparent necessity for his remaining longer. Have you any orders to give in regard to his command.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

ORD'S HEADQUARTERS,

March 31, 1865-9.30 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Have moved my center line of skirmishers and sharpshooters and driven enemy's pickets in; shall establish batteries to-night; 189 prisoners, 2 officers and 18 deserters (one a lieutenant) in so far. The enemy's battery near and south of Hatcher's Run is so situated that it can be taken in reverse from my left, where Michie proposes erecting a battery. We can render it untenable, so that General Humphreys can take it. Prisoners stat there is a continuous line of works along Heth's division, and on h is left, with strong lines of abatis in rear of Heth's division-was this morning. Mahone and Cooke's right rests on the run, and they are on the extreme right of Heth's division. They say their line is well stretched, but their reserve is good.

E. O. C. ORD.
