ation regarding the late election in Arkansas;
which was ordered to lie ou the table.
KKV1SI0N OF TIIK LAWS.
The PllESIDENT pro tempore laid before
the Senate the following report of the commis-
sioners appointed under the act of June 27,
1800, to provide for the revision and consoli-
dation of the statute laws of the United States;
which was read:
The undersigned, commissioners appointed under
the aet of June 27, 1866, "to provide for the reviMon
and consolidation of the statute lawn of tho United
States." respectfully report, to tho Senate:
That they began their labors by an examination of
the methods adopted in revisions of a similar charac-
ter, and afterward framed a provisional scheme for
the work in hand. They iirransjed tho contents of
the Statiites-at-Liirfjo, so far as it could bedono pro-
visionally, undertitles, and proceeded to revise these
titles separately. It became apparent that, they wore
so connected that very few of thorn could be consid-
ered safely ascertained and completed until the body
of connected titles should be revised. They have,
therefore, pursued the necessary course, and have
prepared a. considerable amount of material upon the
various connected titles.
Tn doing this work they have found it indispensable
to recast every statute from which they take any pro-
vision. Where several statutes relating to the same
subject modify each other it has been impossible to
state their united cffect without writing a new statuto.
To retain the, language of the fragments in t'oreo would
commonly bo to misstate the intention of the whole.
The caro necessary in this process requires greater
time than a revision after tho method of compilation
would have done.
Tiie few specimens which they havo printed have
been offered meicly as examples of tile method
adopted by them, and not as indicating the amount
of work done. They have hoped that by means of a
reference of these to appropriate committees they
might ascertain whether that method was deemed by
Congress to bo in accordance with the act by which
they aro authorized.
The commissioners have been obliged to expend a
considerable part of their labor in learning tho art;
and they hel^jvo that their experience must enable
them, as it. already does, to work with increasing
rapidity. But they are still unablo to answer the
second inquiry put to them in tho resolution of tho
Senate with delinitoness. They do not believe, how-
ever, that with any amount of industry and ability
the revision of the permanent and general statutes
of the United States can be correctly done within
the period limited by tho act of June 27. They can
only say that they arc giving their best endeavors to
accomplish tho work without delay and with strict
correctness. WILLIAM ,1011 N'STOX,
