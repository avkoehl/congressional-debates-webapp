necessary after a while to build an additional win 
to the Opitol to hoid them These great abuses
have their root and their oiigin in the appointment
of these public prirte-s, who aie indefatigable in
their exertions to find out fat j jbt. for thémseUes
for the vacation, and there can be no sort of doubt
that if this could have Leen foie^een by those who
pacsed the jont resolution iu 1819, the pioposi
tion would not h-tve received the si^htes' coun-
tenance The committee of 1819 thought the
expenditure then was large, and mtro luced that
josnt resolution as an experim-^t only, m the
hope of cut recti ig it \V hat would be the aston-
ishment of the suivivors of that committee, to see
an experditure of one hundied and lorty or one
hundred and fifty thousand dollars a year founded
on thstr act' Iheti astonishment would be excea
sive that we had not got rid of an experiment
which had worked so contrary to their views and
t íe pe petuity which has attended it The House
has thus, far declined acting on their resolution,
and if that body hasde idea that to elect a printer
now, would be an encroachment upon the rights
of the m-xt House, pught this blanch to act in
contradiction to themJ Ought we not to postpone
that, which is in itse'f an evil, when so good an
exaiq le has been given us? Ihe next Senate is
competent to provide its own printer, and we can
leave the ¡secietary of the Senate, in the mean
tn ie, to have tne printing done by jobs Mr B
consideied tl e eleCv on now, as i ull and void, and
he wished his vo ce to go for..h against i'—that
he titxt Senate v ere no more bound to receive a
prmtei imposed upor them by us, than they were
to receive the ink, s ationery, or \«,ood, that we
might prov de them and although they might ac-
quiesce in recfivipg it, jet, if they did not like it,
thiy might reject the whole of it So \ nh regard
to a pi inter It weshmld electa man who might
be disagreeable to them, tl ey might say they
voulu have no printer, or they vt uld have their
pttnung done oi contract of the Secretary, byjob
Alth ugh the feenate is a permanent body, yet the
persons employed by it are not so Mr B said
he, tor one, ttuul 1 i ot sibtmt to the imposition
and if a disj0teeajieman should b  imposed upon
him by men who wcie just lea\mg then seats,
eveiy tfort should be made to rout him fiom his
place Aye to tout him fiom his place, and if that
d ii iotsa<- eet!, he would n y to prevent his obtain-
ing enormous jobb, and he now gave roticeof that
intention, so t ¡at no blame or cei sure could attach
to tha  body
Mr PRLsTON said that when the joint i eso
mtion of the honorable gentleman was ieferred to
tne Judtciaiy Commit ee, his a tention was turned
to the history of the print ng of Congress, and he
found that in 1819 a jiint resol it on was passt-d,
regulating j ermanet  Ij   the mode of getting the
printing of the two Houses executed,so fai as the
prices  were the subject of regulation,  and  the
practice his been to tlect by ballot ever since
VVht'evei doubt there mry 1 e as to the interpreta-
tion of the lesolution of 1810, tiere can be none
as to that of 1829, because ¡t «enacted that of
1819, and required the printing to be done by a
printer \ ho was to be elected  by ballot     1 he
practice, men, was of four een ) ears' standing, and
it was sustatneJ by a joint resolution of the two
Houses     The gentleman from Missouri says that
this Senate has nonjli  to impose a printer on the
lieu Senate but in 1829 tVie honnrible gentleman
sustttned the principle of imposing a prmtei on the
te\t session, am> now for thefiist time, is this
practice pronounced illegal, at d discourteous to
that body     The honorable gentleman says, too,
a at great abn-es exist here which aie i ot ex  ,
ceeded (\en in the Post Office    Gieat abuses no '
doubt exist in every department of the Govern
ment     But if the whole sum for punting here
we-e wasted and thrown away, it could not be
compared to the abuses in the Post Office     But [
th'e met ease in the whole expenditure of the Gov
ernment is in the same ratio as the increase here
In 1S19 it was from fifteen to twenty thousand
dollars    Now strike out the printing of these land j
ofike documents, and it is not double that of 1829
!n other brand es, the printing has mcteased m
the a me i atio     But the Senate is in opposition to
the Pies dent and House of Representatives, and
it is nece-sary to appeal to our common masters,
and aie we, tnen, to retrench hele, and give up
1 the whole field of public opinion to them to Op.
erate in > The Preoid-nt- and the House of Rep-
resentatives each incur greater expenses for print-
ing than we do We are bound to send informa
tion of our doings to those who sent us here, it is
extremely necessary The press is used for tlie
pupose of sending abroad etpmle information, and
we are bound to counteract such proceedings He
was disposed to correct abuses here as much as any
gentleman, and would be glad to see the public
printing done independently of the public press of
the country, and would gladly go for a public
printing press, if it was practicable The honor-
able gentleman's objection to electing a printer
has a two fold effect First, that the printer
sohc.ts useless jobs, and second, that the Senate
grants them, and that these abuses are the neees
sary consequences of electing a printer If this
be so he wes willing to reform the evil He woold
not vote for any measure, but upon a conscientious
conviction that the public welfare required it He
was v llhng to reform at home first, and to begin
upon hts own fnerds too But if gentlemen are
willing to reform he^e, let them go to reform the
1 executive printing, let them begin at the Wrote
House, and he would be very glad to see the honor-
I able gentleman S talents m saving the money of the
i country employed in that quarter It is proper,
therefore, to proceed to this election now—the pres-
ent printer has a large and expensive establish-
ment—he has a large capita) employed, and if he
is not to b° the printer, he ought to know it But
whether he is elected or not the successful person
ought to make his arrangements—he did not know
what the result might be, be hoped an individual
of his politics might be chosen, he trusted he
would—but he wished it might be terminated in
some way
Mr BENTON said the plan he would propose
foi having the public punting done hereafter, was
the one he should read [Mr B then read a pas-
sage fiom the import of the committee of 1819, in
favor of the establishment of a national printing
office ] This, he said, is the way the British Par-
liament does its printing, and it is. the best in the
world He said, when up before, that the abuses
of printing in the Senate exceeded that of all the
other depaitments of the Government, the Poe-t
Oífi"e included, and this is to be dated from the
point at which we started In 1819, the total for
the Senate was $8,000, and for the House $15,000
What is it now* He did not know, nor did he
believe any body else knew Por here, in the
general appropriation bill are some «¡120,000 for
arrearages What la the increase of §120,000 be-
yond $8 000? It is not quite 20 to 1, but it is 16
or 17 lo 1 Now.m whatdepaitrnent of the Gov-
ernment will you find an increase of 16 or 17 fold'
Mr B said the honorable gentleman fiom South
Carolina wanted him to try to reform at the White
House, or some of the oiher departments But
how should he succeed there, when all his efforts
here, al'hough aided by the influence of the gen-
tleman, are so unsuccessful' If, with the assist-
ance of those who preach retrenchment here, he
could effect nothing, how could he do it there'
Mr B said he had taken his stand upon the inher-
ent r ght of each House to provide its printing,
fuel, and stationery Here we have ordered a
document to be printed of some 4,000 pages, 3,500
of which have been delivered Now what use can
be made of it? He had not looked into it, and
he had neither seen noi heaid any reference made
to it No extra numbers of it have been struck
off Only a single copy for distribution among
the members And as regarded the documents,
those of the last year, he believed, had never been
distributed yet he never saw his quota, though
perhaps they may have been sent to htm to &t
Lou s And how many of these documents (the
Post Office leports) w ill each member send away'
After sending some fifty or one hundred, the rest
aie an encumbrance on their hands The gentle
man from South Carolina very candidly admitted
that he had another object in view in this move-
ment—that he wished to keep up apaitiean news-
paper Mr B said if he misunderstood the gen-
tleman, he would yield the floor to be corrected
Mr PRESTON said if printing was used else-
where to sustain party presses, he would consider
it but fair to elect i printer on the same ground
He would vote for a printer who corresponded in
