The next was a corollary from the undisputed right to punish
offences against the law of nations, that the right must be lm
plied to prevent offences
If the power, then, exists, the only question remaining is,
how this power may be applied Upon this he thought there
couldbeno doubt The Constitution authorizes Congress to
pass such laws as may be necessary to carry out the enume
rated powers of Government
As to the expediency of themeasure, he considered it so sim-
ple and unexceptionabie in its character,that it mustbe admitted
that, if the power is to be exercised at all, this is the most ex
pedient mode of doing it, and, trusting he had pioved both the
constitutionality and necessity, lie should conclude by simply
statins that he gave thebi 1 his hearty support.

Mr BOWNE, after an allusion to die changeof refeience of
the papers m this c'aee from tire Committee of Ways and Means
to the Committee on Public Buildmas—although'the matter
was not legitimately one for their cons.deration—as both extra
ord.nary and suspicious, recapitulated some facts heretofore
stated to the commute'1, m ref rence to the increase of the appro-
priation to &28 2t 0 from $10,000, asked for at the extra session,
and said that the delay which liad been occasioned m this case, to
which allusion had been made, was caused by an attempt to
ascertain the propriety of the increase m the appropiiauon
The committee understood that a resolution had been passed
calling upon the Secretaiy of the Treasury to furnish to the
House certain information m relation to the furniture of this
custom house, and the committee had waited to get the Secre
tary's report, but no report was ever mad*, and the committee
was unable to asceuain whether these expenditures had been
made under the authority 01 sanction of any law The commit
tee were aware that much had been said, byontors on the
stump, by the public new spaper press, and by politicians from
one end of the country to the other, on the subject of misappli
cations of thepublic money by agents of the Government, and
they wished to ascertain whether this was such a mioappl ca
tion, or whcthei there had been warrant fol it by law, or by
any authorized agent of the Government
The committee weie unable to discover any authonty for
this appropriation by law, and they found that Congress, by a
deliberate vote had refused the appropriation    They found
that Mr   Secretary Woodbuiy had refused his authority ot
sanction for this use of the public money, and he (Mr B ) was
astonished yesterday to hear it repeatedly declared that the col
lectoi or agent at New lgrk had the authority of Mr   Wood
bury for this expenditure and to hear úfi that authority was
drawn from a letter wlncfi, when read, negatived any such war
rant    Iheappioval of k plan was construed into an authonty
to expend money, but with what grape could gentlemen even
take that as an authority, when the; plan approved by Mr
Woodbury was subsequently changed, and the money now
asked was for work done in pursuance ol a plan which dif
fend from that of which Mr Woodbuiy approved'   He next
wont on toshow t'at Mr Ewm 's letter did not give the au
thorny, and showed that the course suggested by Mi   Tmng
ws not pursued    And where, then, he asked, was their an
thorny foi this expéndame of tie public money?   <>. undei
wha' pietence v,as tt p.stifiedT   He was the last man to irftct
an injury on the mechanic 0/ the laborer, but the tale ttll in
lela ion to that c ass of mer#was abtory to amuse the ear of ti e
ciedu'ous     \\ cs Congress to sit there to make an apj lopria
tnn of the public money   to meet an expenditure made not
only without authority, but in contravention of the AillofGov
eminent'   And was it to be justified by the staleotPht that
aCTints had employed medíame*, ind those mechanics bad not
b en f aid!   What evidence had they that the mechanics had
n .t been paid'   None whatevei    &U11 it would not justify the
appropriation if such evidence were produced, foi expendí
tures made m violation ol law, and contrary to the known will
of Congiess    The laborers and the mechanics had a perlect
remedy, if they had not been paid, against the agents by whom
they were employed, who weie peisonally responsible to the
mechanics    Itwasnot a con ract, at all events, between the
Government and the mechanics let, then, the mechanics look
to ih° agent  an 1 when the question came directly befor them,
between the agent and the Government, they could call upon
the agent to show by what authority the work had been done
He would not withhold, for any motive under heaven ásmele
dollar from any individual who had a just and legal claim on
this Government, but he could not eive a vote which should
expiess his assent that an agent or officer of the Government,
at his own volition without authonty of law, shall make con
tracts, for which this G0vernme.1i' sh«U be liable  or s'ia'1 dts
b tree the public money    He could not, therefore, ascent to this
appropriation
Mi REYNOLDS expressed his stiong disapprobation of
the extravagance of expendmue memred fortius object, and
colled upon gentlemen of the Whig pany to cany outtbti. pro
ftssionsof economy and refoun bysettmg their fares acainst it
Did we not (said he.) pi lor to the last Presidential election,
hear litreiicliment ind reform proclaimed fiom one end of the
continent to the other? Would not gentlemen adhere to their
profession , and now, when thty had so ¡rood an opportunity of
carrymir their principles into practice, stop this extravagant
expenditure' He would tell gentlemen oí the majority of

to refute the assumptioi that any partof this extiayaganee bad

gentleman autho' zed an expenditure 101 furniture of sSOOonly,
and did not go so far as #8,000, as gentlemen contcnued.
Mr. WARD regretted that the question was.not taken yes.
terday, after the remarks of the cbaiiman of the Committee of
Ways and Means had placed it in so clear a lighc Had the
question been taken then, he was disposed to think that the ap-
propriation would have been gi anted. Since then, the debate
had taken so wide a range, that a good deal of corifusion ¿lad
been thrown round the question He would not, he said, stop
to inquire whether it was a justifiable expenditure ftewtiulct
not inquire whether the agents of the Government had exceed-
ed their authonty in making the contracts Tbe only question
with him was, had the work been done, and was the Government
receiving the benefitof ill This being clearly established, he
should not hesitate to vote for the expenditure Much stress
had been laid on the extravagance ofexpenditui e for this build-
ing and its fixtmes, but was that a solitary easel Look at this
city—look at the Patent Office and at the General Post Office.
Had not the expenditures for these buildings far exceeded the
estimates? and did not the agents go beyond the appropriations?
If the agents of the Government had not discharged their duty
correctly, letthem be brought here and punished, but the mo-
ney justly due by the Government should be appropriated,
whether 1 was to gu to tbe poor mechanics 01 to the contractor.
He hoped theie would be no further discussion, and that the
committee would at once take the question It was suggested
that this bill should soon pass, on account of the number of iu-
dividu ils who were sufleiing for want of the sums due them
Mr GAR-RETTDAVISaddress d Ihe committee in opposition
to theappropnanon, denounced the corrupt and extravagant
expend ture which had been inctn led, and charged the collector
with being guilty either of criminal negligence, or corrupt col
lusion with the contiactois
Mr TILLMORL i.aid be had but a few words to say on this
question, as he was not disposed to jnake speeches, but he
wished to set the committee right with regard to a fact. It
seemed to be theimpressien that this appiopnation was asked
for <fuilnisbtng"and------                                                                *
Mi DaVIS Is not a "table" ' furniture'!'1 Is not a "desk"
alsc "furmturel" And does not the appropriation include these
items?
Mr FILLMORE said he did not know as to thaf, bat on look-
ing at ilieappropnalion, he found that the item was fcr "build-
ing," not fm furniti.ii He begged the attention of the com-
mit ce to what bad been gained by the reaction of the appro-
priation in the last Cong.ess It appeared it was prebented to
tbe House on the 21 b of February, that the vole w is taken for
"furnituie," and that they lejtcted the item $8,000, through
e\ lcmc economy, yet, in seven da>s afterwards, the Secre-
taiy 0. iheTreasu.y(Mr Ev-.ng) approves of paying no less a
sum than $70 000 foi lbs veiy w rk Congress refused the
S8 000m the first notante ano by this parsimonious economy,
they let the work go on, so as to put the country to an expense
of ten tunes 'heamount They had deemed it propel tocharge
this appropnauon as ' extravagant," because a caee of mahog-
any was included in the item, and tins was called "economy "
He had nothing to say to any officer of the Governmt nt on the
question now before the committee, but he was sorry to say
that the poor people were suffering from day to day He there-
fore calle I upon Congress to pay its honest debts, and prevent
those honest laborers fiom suffering
. Mr SAUNDERS said they had tbe authority of the Secretary
of the Treasury, and of Mr Woodbuiy also, late Secretary of
tbe Tie isury which was foun edon wnt'en evidence, by which
it appeared that Congress were called upon to make the appro-
priation, subject to the proviso that the contract should be fur-
nished to the committee of tbe House
Mr PROrriTsa.d he was lately engaged in the Treasury,
and he could confirm the remarks Tbe letter stated distinctly
"that the appropriation should not be made unless Congress
approved "
Mr nj LMORE said, at the time he had made his remarks
in reference to the Secretary of the Treasury, (Mr Woodbury,)
he fol' bound to say be had not read the repon, an extiact from
v> Inch had now j 1st Leen road from the Clerk's table His re-
marks weie based on tbe letter which he hadyesterflay read.
It appeared from the repoi t that Mr Woodbuiy directed that no
expendituie should be made fol furniture until an appropria-
tion was mad  by Congress It seemed that the estimates were
submitted to Can«iess andafinal vote on theappropnanon for
furniture was taken on the 21th Tebruiiy Wl, and rejected;
