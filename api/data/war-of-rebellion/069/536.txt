HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June [3], 1864-6 a. m.

Major-General MEADE:

I have got a prisoner from Ewell's corps, who says the corps is in front of my right, and holding where we were yesterday. I began to find out the position of the enemy as soon as we could see. The movement of our trains last night to meet my preparation to take the new position directed and the change made by the attack of the enemy caused so much confusion in them that I could not get up ammunition till this morning. The enemy seems to show a disposition to [attack] on my right where it in thrown back. General Burnside has been moving since daylight, so as to get, I believe, around on the enemy's left on the Shady Grove road from Linney's. He has not made any attack yet, but is about to. On the next page you can see my position sketched.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.

[Map.]

I cannot well advance unless those on my right or left succeed in doing so. In spite of all my efforts, I am unable to shorten my line yet so as to get any reserve beside the single line of battle. There is not a point I can give up unless it is form my left.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
