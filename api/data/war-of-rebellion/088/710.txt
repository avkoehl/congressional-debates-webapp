HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,In the Field, September 5, 1864. (Received 1.30 p. m.)

Major General D. B. BIRNEY,

Tenth Army Corps:

General Grant, through General Ord, did designate the Twenty-second. I should not think it necessary for it to be withdrawn till night, and go down early in the morning. Received telegram from Colonel Shaffer that General Butler would be at Fort Monroe Wednesday morning.

Respectfully,

R. S. DAVIS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 5, 1864.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report that I have just received an order form General Ord to send one of my regiments to Fort Powhatan. Taking my regiments will leave me without force for fatigue purposes.

D. B. BIRNY,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS,September 5, 1864.

General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

As the absence of General Ord places [me] in command of department, I will try and arrange the matter to avoid sending another regiment from my thin line.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.
