the road. Colonel Case, commanding brigade, handled and disposed of his force most admirably, moving far enough to the left so that, advancing obliquely to the enemy's lines, he would strike their flank. Everything being arranged, the One hundred and second Illinois on the right, the Seventh-ninth on the left, the charge was sounded, and with shouts the line advanced at a run on the enemy, sweeping everything before them. In vain the enemy resisted; in vain he labored to get his artillery off the field. The horses were shot down and the gunners were captured at their guns. At the point where the right wing crossed the enemy's works, I found one piece of artillery worked by a sergeant and six men. These we captured. There was still another piece of artillery farther to the left captured at the same time, claimed by the Seventy-ninth Ohio Volunteer Infantry and by the skirmishers of the One hundred and fifth Illinois. Not desiring to raise any controversy, I will simply say it, too, was one of the trophies of the old First Brigade. Other prisoners than those mentioned were taken by the Seventy-ninth and sent to the rear. To us it was not a bloodless victory; it cost the Seventy-ninth in killed, 5; wounded, 24, some of whom have since died. Judging from what I saw in passing over the field, the enemy's loss in front of the Seventy-ninth was much greater.

Second: The weather and roads proved extremely bad and unfavorable.

Third: Supplies as a general thing were obtainable, but at a great risk. Fourth: Health of the regiment continued good. This is remarkable, when the inclemency of the weather is taken into account, and added thereto the miserable condition of the men's clothing, more particularly in the item of shoes, many of the men being barefooted.

To the specific items to which your circular directs attention I have to state as follows:

The above estimate in some items may be incorrect, but in the main nearly correct.

The officers and men all having performed their duty so well, I do not feel at liberty to make special mention, but say that to each and all I am especially indebted for the prompt and gallant manner in which they acquitted themselves on the various occasions that test the soldier.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. W. DOAN,
