The advance of our troops have just reached this place. Will commence crossing the James to-morrow. Wilson's cavalry and Warren's corps moved from Long Bridge to White Oak Swamp to cover the crossing of the balance of the army. No fighting has been reported except a little cavalry skirmishing. Smith's corps went around by water and will commence arriving at City Point to-night.

BERMUDA HUNDRED, VA.,

June 14, 1864 - 1.30 p. m.

Our forces will commence crossing the James to-day. The enemy shows no sings yet of having brought troops to the south side of Richmond. I will have Petersburg secured, if possible, before they get there in much force. Our movement from Cold Harbor to the James River has been made with great celerity and so far without loss of accident.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
