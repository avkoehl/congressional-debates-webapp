Richmond, Va., December 19, 1864.

General BRAXTON GRAGG,

Wilmington, N. C.:

General Lee communicates as a report, which he deems probably exaggerated, that enemy's fleet left Old point 9 a. m. 16th for Wilmington, consisting of Colorado and Wabash, painted white, with Confederate flag, with troops under deck, two double-turreted monitors, one high-turreted monitor, two double-enders, eleven iron-clads, twelve mortar-boats, the remainder transports, there being in all eighty-five steamers. The land force of 20,000 under Butler, the naval force under Lee and Porter.

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

WILMINGTON, December 19, 1864.

(Received 10.50 p. m.)

Honorable J. A. SEDDON:

Information seems reliable of formidable attack here. The troops ordered away cannot return; if not helped, the forts may be turned and the city goes. The reduced garrisons are not able to hold this extended position without support.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTER FIRST ARMY CORPS,

December 20, 1864-12.10 a. m.

Major General J. B. KERSHAW,

You will relieve General Hoke's division at daylight this morning. Be particular in having your troops on Hoke's front at daylight, as General Hoke is ordered to move out at that time.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

O. LATROBE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
