SEPTEMBER 1, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

It was known that this brigade is at this time in the Department of Richmond. As it constitutes a part of Johnson's division and is only temporarily detached, the application for its transfer to another command, by exchange, was submitted for the views of General Beauregard. The exchange is deemed advisable.

By order of General Lee:

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

By command of General Beauregard:

HDQRS. 17TH AND 23rd TENNESSEE REGIMENTS,Signal Hill, September 9, 1864.

Respectfully returned.

From my long connection with what is known as General B. R. Johnson's old brigade, and from recent expressions of opinion on the part of the officers and men composing the brigade, I am justified in saying in their behalf, and on my own part, that we are not willing to enter into any arrangement that will in any way destroy our identity as a brigade. We are now in the Department of Richmond, under Lieutenant-General Ewell, but not in Richmond on provost duty, as stated by General Archer. In my opinion the consolidation of this brigade has three times recruited its often thinned and decimated ranks to the maximum prescribed by law, and, though now much reduced by the many recent engagements which it has been in, it can again be recruited to the maximum number if allowed to return to Tennessee or remain where we are a sufficient time for our friends to learn our whereabouts.

H. READY,

Lieutenant-Colonel.
