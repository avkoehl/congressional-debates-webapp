mation in regard to the movement from a woman who had seen the soldiers at Mrs. Jenkins" plantation. Some of the remaining hands protested that they would not work any longer on the plantations, bug have concluded, since I have talked with them, to go on with their labors, and a few are willing to do more than before. This conscription, together with the manner of its execution, has created a suspicion that the Government has not the interest in the negroes that it has professed, and many of them sighed yesterday for the "old fetters" as being better than the new liberty. My own heart well-night failed me, and but for the desire to still sympathize with this, as they call themselves, 'short-minded" but peculiar people, I should desire to commit my charge to some person with a stronger mind and sterner heart than my own.

It giver me pleasure to state to-day that there is something less of the demonstration of grief than yesterday, though their hearts are still large with thoughts of the separation.

With much respect, I subscribe myself, your humble servant,

G. M. WELLS,

Superintendent of Plantations.

Numbers 8.* DOCTOR POPE'S PLANTATION, Saint Helena, Tuesday, May 13-9 a. m.

DEAR MR. PIERCE: It was late Sunday evening when Mr. Philbrick came in bearing General Stevens" circular, and the accompanying note from yourself. This was the first notice we had of the movement. We could do nothing till the arrival of the squad which Mr. Philbrick said was to come that very night to execute the order. About midnight Captain Stevens rode up to our door and was quietly admitted. He said the squad was on the road and handed me the "descriptive list" to be filled out. "How and when shall it be done? I asked. "You know best about that and will act accordingly," was his reply. Clearly the military relied upon us to make the seizure, and as the event proved, the work was all ours. A few minutes later the squad of the men stole into our yard. I detailed four of them to go over to Wells", and led the remainder into the house to pass the rest of the night, taking the precaution to close the setters of the room, that they might not be seen in the morning. I then marched the squad of four over to Mrs. Jenkins" plantations returned and turned in for two or three hours's sleep till sunrise, at which hour I has agreed with the doctor to go over to the Indian Hill Plantation, before the negroes went out to their work, while he did the same at Doctor Pope's, that the alarm might not spread from one place to the other and the men take themselves to the woods. Reaching the negro quarters before 6 o"clock, I find the people quietly at work, the men and boys grinding corn for the morning meal, the women cooking in their cabins. The corporal and his squad are to follow in a few minutes. I gather the men quietly and tell them that General Stevens has sent for them to come immediately to Beaufort, and that we must all obey the general's orders. By this time the corporal comes up and bids them "fall in." They move reluctantly, they must have their jackets, their shoes, &amp;c. The women reluctantly, they must have their jackets, their shoes, &c. The women are sent to fetch them, as I am afraid we en if ur sight. This causes some
