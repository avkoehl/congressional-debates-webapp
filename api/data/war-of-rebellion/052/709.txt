(Received 1.26 p.m.)

Major General T. L. CRITTENDEN:

The general commanding directs you to put General van Cleve's and General Palmer's commands in readiness to march. Move them at once, sufficiently to be out of the way of General Thomas, in some shade in an unmolested position farther down Chickamauga Creek. General Wood's division may not need to be moved at present.

Brigadier-General GARFIELD,

Chief of Staff:

SIR: The general commanding directs me to inform you that at the time your order arrived directing the immediate removal of his Second and Third Divisions, in order to give room for General and is now here, and they both concluded that it would be unwise to move them until definite orders were received locating the two divisions. There is ample room for the troops of General Thomas that are yet to come up. The general, however, has put the divisions under order to be ready to move at a moment's notice.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. P. OLDERSHAW.
