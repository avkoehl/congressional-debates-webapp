covered with woods. The infantry has just formed and starts to attack the gap; the artillery is in position and I hope to be able to send you word within half an hour or an hour that the ridge is taken.

Respectfully,

CHAS. W. ASMUSSEN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Have not heard from General Butterfield, but General Geary has sent out two parties to communicate with him.

[Indorsement.]

Signal this to General Thomas.

Major-General HOOKER:

GENERAL; As Wood's brigade approached Buzzard Roost they came up to a line from the Fourteenth Corps advancing perpendicular to them and halted. I came up and found Generals Sherman and Howard on a hill about a mile to our left. Just been over to see them; Sherman does not wish the bridge to retire until after a while. Pushed a line of skirmishers close to Mill Creek and gap in ridge at Buzzard Roost. Scouts report the enemy in force behind lines of breast-works. The presence of troops from the Fourth and Fourteenth Corps will prevent, of course, the accomplishment of my instruction to draw them out. The pass is a very ugly place to send troops, and Rocky Face Ridge upon our right prevents turning it. I have just directed a light reconnaissance to feel the lines of works and draw the fire, but no to expose or lose any men. This is in accordance with a request of sherman. As soon as this is done I suppose I will be permitted to return to the brigade.

Very respectfully,DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, TWENTIETH ARMY CORPS, May 8, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel PERKINS:

COLONEL: I inclose a copy of a dispatch which I sent to General Sherman at 4 o'clock. I find it has not reached him, as he had left the hill before the orderly got there. I send it to you. My belief is that there is not to exceed two brigades of the enemy at Buzzard Roost; that they will leave there to-night, provided McPherson takes Snake [Creek] Gap or Geary takes Dug Gap. I am exceedingly anxious about the small force left of Buzzard Roost.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General.

Major-General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: Scouts sent from my skirmish line report seeing, through the gap, trains, cavalry, and infantry moving to the enemy's left-our
