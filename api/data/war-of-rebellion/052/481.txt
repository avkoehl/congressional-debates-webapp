HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, September 9, 1863.

Memoranda of information given by Mr. Thompson, said to be a very loyal citizen of Chattanooga, and who claims to have a son in our secret service:

* * * * *

One corps retreated by the Cove road (this road probably leads into the La Fayette road) ; one corps retreated by the La Fayette road proper. Buckner's corps retreated from Tyner's Station, via Ringgold, to Rome.

The army has retreated to Rome, where it is said it will make a stand. Infantry (two corps) left yesterday morning; certainly pickets left two hours before we got in. Bulk of cavalry has been down about Coosa River; if we pursue vigorously they will not stop short of Atlanta. Troops badly demoralized; all feel that they are whipped; one-seventh of the troops mostly naked; the rations for three days would make one good meal.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS, September 9, 1863-2 a.m.

Major F. S. BOND,Aide-de-Camp:

The general directs me to say that he has ordered the Ninety-second Illinois Volunteer Infantry to reconnoiter the Ridge road as far as possible in the direction of Chattanooga. General Brannan will be notified to hold his command unreadiness to support he movement indicated in dispatch.

Very respectfully,

GEO. E. FLYNT,
