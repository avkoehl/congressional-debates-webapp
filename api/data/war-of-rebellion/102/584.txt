at this post, and respectfully request that the One hundred and twenty-sixth Regiment Illinois Infantry Volunteers, of the Second Brigade, be ordered here for duty, or else some other troops in lieu thereof. My reasons for this request are based on the following facts: Deputations of respectable and responsible citizens are constantly arriving here from the surrounding counties, who represent the general disposition of the good citizens of their respective counties as anxious to return to their allegiance to the Federal Government, and as speedily as possible to restore the functions of civil government and to maintain good order. They further represent, in the present transition of affairs from a state of chaos to the establishment of law by the civil courts, and form the further facts of a large number of paroled Confederate soldiers who are continuously arriving at their homes, and from the further fact that the citizens of their respective counties have hitherto been divided in their political sentiments, as well as from the fact that there are numbers of bad men who are found committing every species of depredation on the inhabitants, that a small military force is actually necessary to be present to aid and protect the people from the acts of bad and violent men until such time as the people shall be able to form militia organizations, in accordance with law, for their mutual self-protection, and to enable them to establish courts and officers of the law. I have consented, and shall station in each county one company for the above purpose. To do so will reduce my force at this post below the wants of the service.

All of which is respectfully submitted to commanding general of the department.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN EDWARDS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
