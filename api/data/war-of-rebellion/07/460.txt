HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT SOUTHEAST MISSOURI,Cairo, Ill., November 29, 1861.

Captain J. C. KELTON, Saint Louis, Mo.:

I have here two prisoners, arrested as spies, who are undoubtedly guilty of the charge. One of them can be proven to have been engaged in carrying information from sympathizers in South Illinois to the troops at Columbus, Ky. As the evidence against these prisoners will be more easily obtained here than in Saint Louis, I would recommend that their trial take place here.

Information from Columbus to-day is to the effect that the rebels have three gunboats. They are small, carrying but four guns each, but I have no information as to their strength. The State of Mississippi has called for 10,000 State troops for sixty days to assist in the defense of Columbus. There seems to be a great effort making throughout the South to make Columbus impregnable. i get this information from the Memphis Appeal of the 28th (yesterday), a copy of which I received this evening. I give the information for what it is worth.
