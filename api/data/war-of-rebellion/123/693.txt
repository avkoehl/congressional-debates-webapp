COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 28, 1862.

General BUCKINGHAM:

Recruiting for three years from drafted men, or their substitutes, is about over. We have left of the drafted men about 5,000 that must be organized into nine or twelve months" regiments. I am of opinion that,if authorized to advance half the bounty allowed by law to twelve-months" volunteers, at least 4,000 would volunteer for twelve months. What says the Secretary of War to this?

D. TOD,

Governor.

Washington City, D. C., October 28, 1862.

His Excellency Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

The Secretary of War declines to authorize the bounty to be paid to twelve-months" men. I will write by mail in reply to the points in your memorandum.

C. P. BUCKINGHAM,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

COLUMBUS, OHIO, October 28, 1862.

General C. P. BUCKINGHAM:

The drafting commissioners have difficulty in settling subsisting bills for the drafted men for the want of a mustering officer's certificate. In many of the counties all the men volunteered into three-years" service, and in all of the counties they did so to some extent. For these men there is no mustering officer. Please give Captain Harrington the necessary instructions, which, in my opinion, should be to take the certificate of the commissioner.

DAVID TOD.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., October 28, 1862.

Governor TOD,

Columbus, Ohio:

The instructions you require will be immediately given. Please report the number of men mustered and where they are.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

(Receive 9.15 p. m. 29th.)

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Quartermaster-General Wright has already received, say, $50,000 from conscientious drafted men, and several counties are yet to report. Shall we endeavor to hire substitutes with this fund, or what shall be done with it?

DAVID TOD.
