have that many ready to start to me the instant I telegraph for them? If you can at the same time send horses for the guns it would be best. I do not like to venture my battery horses, for we may be called on to use them at a moment's notice. Please let your quartermaster, if you can, send horses and wagons in case they are wanted.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., July 31, 1864-12 m.

Colonel PIPER,

Chief of Artillery, Eighteenth Corps:

I will keep eleven wagons and three teams constantly ready for Captain Dow's material, subject to your telegram. I shall also have other transportation generally in part for the rest, or part of it, and can always inform you of the amount. I think Captain Dow's mantlets had better be sent back. I will send for them if desired.

Captain BROOKER,

Commanding Siege Battery near Warren's Headquarters:

(Through his Telegraph Operator).

Captain Pierce must gouge out the fuse plugs of his filled shells in some way, if possible. Only abandon and bury them as a last resort. By careful cutting I think he may safely try it.

HENRY L. ABBOT,

Colonel First Connecticut Artillery.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., July 31, 1864-9.30 a.m.

Captain BROOKER:

Tell Captain Pierce to bore out his fuse composition and fill his shells with water as one resort, better than leaving them.

Captain EDSON,

Ordnance Officer at Fort Monroe:

Pleaser retain all ammunition coming to Fort Monroe for my train (except Coehorn mortar) until hearing from me again.
