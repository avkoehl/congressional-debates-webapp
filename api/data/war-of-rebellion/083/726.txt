Question. Do you remember any further particulars of the report than you have stated?

Answer. No, not to General Price.

Re-examined by the JUDGE-ADVOCATE:

Question. You have stated in answer to questions propounded during the cross-examination that you rode along the lines of the army during its march very often, and that General Price used great diligence in preserving order during the march; now state whether or not he took measures to correct every evil resulting from a want of order in the march that was officially reported by you to him.

Answer. He did.

Question (by a MEMBER): To what causes do you attribute the bad discipline of the army, as already stated by you?

Answer. To the fact that two-thirds of the army were deserters from commands south of the Arkansas River, and to the want of the enforcement of discipline by subordinate generals.
