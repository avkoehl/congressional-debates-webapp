I am, very respectfully, your most obedient servant,

Brigadier-General KELLEY,

Cumberland, Md.:

I will send to-day to Harper's Ferry all the re-enforcement available or to spare from here, to wit, six companies of Sixth New York Artillery from First McHenry, two large siege guns, and an independent battery, 103 men and six rifled guns. I have communicated directly with General Kenly because of the emergency seeming to require it.

Harper's Ferry, Va.:

You will remember that it is of vital importance to hold the position and preserve the bridge, railroad, and public property.+
