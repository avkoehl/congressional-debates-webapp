Treasury Department, December 31,1838
Sir Tn answer to your letter of the28th m=tant, T would
observe, that in the document No 111, «em to ihe House
of Rppresentaiives in Janu<tr> last, Mr Harris, the receiver
in note No 48 on page 39, is stated to have paid part of fats
balance, and the remainder to be well secured
In Mr  Bojd s case, it is understood lint the balance is
well secured and in the course oí collection     Such is pre
sumed to be the balance against Linn, it being in suit, and
one of the sureties of the latter being Governor Duncan, of
Illinois    He was not m default when reappointed
These officers were all dismissed, or they resigned as
soon as the balances against them, appearing in the current
returns, were not paid over as directed, or satisfactory rea-
son^ not given for postponement
•spencer is not, and never has been, a def lulter on the
books to my knowledge He onee delayed miking a de
posit from badness of the roads, but it was made as soon
as they became passable
I ain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
LEVI WOODBURY
Hon. A Duncan, House o/JRejwesentafiues
The defalcation of Mr Swartwout for nearly
one and a quarter millions of dollars has not been
embraced in the foregoing views According to
the report of the First Comptroller and Solicitor
of the Treasury, this defalcation commenced and
" increased gradually from the first quarter of
' 1830 to the end of the first quarter of 1838,
* when hia official term expired " The message
of the President at the commencement of this ses
sion informed us that " a change in the office of
1 collector at one of our principal ports (New
•York) has brought to light a defalcation of the
'gravest character" This enormous defaulter
appears to have escaped suspicion during his whole
term of service, and until discovered by his suc-
cessor, Mr Hoyt, whose great vigilance in this
matter, says the National Intelligencer, entitles
him to great credit This defalcation has been
the subject of great abuse in this House, as
though the fate of ths Administration depended
upon it And here, again, the ciedit part of the
account is not given The people are left to infer
that the money is all lost. The First Comptioller
and Solicitor of the Treasury, in the report re-
ferred to, inform us that they " have every reason
to believe that the security of Mr Swaitwout's
official bond is amply sufficient for us amount "
Again, the Solicitor says
"On examining the letKr of attornev from Mr Swart
wout to Mr Ogdt li, I found th it it cool* rrtd on th* ! un r
the fulltt-t ag ney lie was tntinly impn ssed with the
propriety of adopting under it, such measures ¡or th< si -
tunty oí lijo Uwti il tftiitts as wert inluspnw<r Hi his
paid «vi r t > me *> 10,0110 in elsh," ice "Mr O^den lus
also (Vfound as flu altonny of Mt Swartwout, three
morlgngl s oí nil his propi rty tn tin Stall s ot New York,
New Jersey, md M iryland " " These mongóes im lude
lilt, house and lols in this cily, the largo and vtluihle
tn ulow pr )p< rty at Ilobokt n, and ihi inti n &l m tin to il
1 mils at ( limb! rl md As to lb< ir value, I have no nl< (ins
tit loriiiing an o[)fnion, but it is rat* d bv Mr 0o'dt n it a
ver> lar¿e amount "
These extracts show that the laige amount foi
which Mr Swartwout is in default, is not all lost
That all can ivei be obtained, is not to be ex-
pected The evidence here given, neveitheless,
leaves but little doubt that a laige portion of it is
secuie
I have no apology (said Mr M ) to make foi
defaulters 1 he bitter denunciations against them
are no doubt merited; and they shnll have no
commiseration from me But suiely gentlemen
cannot be so blind as not to see that it is utterly
impossible for them to maKe up a great party
issue on this point with the friends of the Admin-
istration It is too plain that such an issue would
be false, and foreign to the great points in contest
between the two great political parties. No' it is
rather a dernier resort—a forlorn hope—which,
though precarious, is all that is left to lay hold of,
after being foiled at every other point Every
other subject which could be pressed into service,
has been used to alarm and frighten the people
heretofore, and this one must subserve the pur-
poses of the present occasion Gentlemen, how-
ever, have rung the alarm bell so often heretofore,
when no injury followed, ami no well founded
signs of danger were discoverable, that they would
now find some difficulty in exciting the public
fears, even if there were now cause of alirm in
every deed But there is none on this, any more
than on former occasions, either to alarm or en-
danger the c tuse of that party whose cause is the
people's*, and who have been struggling to pre-
serve and inculcate, by the merit of its pretensions,
the only true political principles upon which this
Government ever can successfully", or, in my
humble opinion, ever ought, to be administered.
It is certainly cause of regret that defalcations
should take place at any time, but surely the mis-
conduct of a subordinate officer furnishes no more
reason for opposing the Administration, than for
opposing the Government itself, of which he has
shown himself an unworthy member. Thedefec-
tion of a public officer cannot, and ought not, to
contaminate the cause of an Administration which
gave him employ The apostacy of Judas Iscanot
could not be urged as an objection to the cause of
the Redeemer, or cast any obloquy upon his for-
mer associates The vile conduct ot an unworthy
member of the church could not blacken or dis-
parage the cause of truth and religion What
friend of his country would have affirmed, during
the most eventful crisis of our history, that the
cause of Washington and his compatriots was
dishonored by the ti eachery of Arnold ' Yet such
are the unreasonable conclusions to which gentle-
men must arriiva, from the positions they assume
and the argumenls they advance
Nor can the charges here fulminated militate
against the fair standing of the public function-
aries at the head of the Government, unless it can
be shown that they connived at the alleged delin-
quencies But this cannot be pretended with any
semblance of justice 1 am aware that thiough
" life's devious course," it is much easier to find
fault than to escape error But the conduct of the
Executive and his much-abused Secretary of the
Treasuiy, so far as any corrupt motive or crim-
inal delinquency is concerned, will survive un-
scathed the severest scrutiny Not a blot will be
left to obscure the unimpeachable brightness of
their escutcheon. Why, then, is so much of the
time of this House, so precious to the nation, and
so costly to the people, employed in denunciation
and invective' 1 will tell you, sir, (said Mr M )
It is to keep up the late alarms with which the
people were so dolorously saluted fiom this Hall
It is to let down the tail of the late panic by a
gradual piocess, or it is, if possible, to reanimate
and form again the broken phalanx, the ilying
legions of the Opposition, and bring them again
to the charge noon some point more vulnerable
than th-y have heretofoie attacked Above all, it
is to divert the attention of the people from the
true principles in contest between the contending
parties, and to form with the Administration an
immaterial and false issue, upon which to put
themselves for ti lal upon the country Suppose
we go to tnal upon these chaiges m refeience to
the late defalcations Do the Opposition hazard
anything in such a trial' if they fail m obtnining
a verdict on their charges against the Administra-
tion, they lose nothing; no decision is given
against their political principles If they succeed,
on their chirgcs, the Administration loses all
Can the gieat principles for which we contend be
dependent upon the mei it or dement, the fidelity
or delinquency of a collectoi of customs or a re-
ictvti foi public lands' The people are compe-
tent to answer such a question
An appaient determmation on the part of the
Opposition to obstruct the public business has
been one order of battle since the commencement
of the present Congress This llooi has been the
almost dally stage from which gentlemen address
then constituents for the purpose of arousing
party prejudices Much zeal has been manifested
on former occasions to thwart the necessary
measuies of legislation with the view of leaving
the public service unprovided for. Nor has the
national honor or national safety furnished any
security against these partisan attacks, the heavi-
est blows being often leveled against the charactei
of the nation when it was supposed the character
of the Administration could beieached thereby
And although designed exclusively for the tians-
nction of the public business, this House must be
the place, and each session the time, to fight over
the party conflict We meet, sir, not to tiansact
the public business, but to embanass it Not to
provide for the public seivtce, but to cripple and
break it down Not to redeem the public faith,
but to violate it Not to strengthen the publ c
confidence, but to wake up dormant and imagin-
ary suspicions.    Not to maintain the national
honor, but, if possible, to disgrace the Adminis-
tration We make speeches, not to allay party
excitement, but to fan its devouring flame. Not
to enlighten the public mind, but to "darken
counsel " and bewilder the judgment Why, sir,
could the people be here from the distant corners
of this wide extended Republic, and see us
" Play such fantastic tricks
Before high heaven,"
they would cry, "Shame' shame' Is there no
American blood to suffuse the cheek with the
crimson blush' Is there no patriotic spirit to
prompt to nobler action ' These walls were not
made to echo the jarring sounds of discord. This
Hall was not constructed to be desecrated with
mere party oblations."
PRESIDENT'S ANNUAL MESSAGE.
SPEECH OF HON. ISAAC E. CRARY,
op michigan,
In the House of Representatives,
January 30, 1839,
On the motion to refer the various topics embraced
in the President's Annual Message to theappro-
pnate committees
Mr  CRARY rose and said.
Mr. Chairman: As  the committee have dis-
posed of the most important resolutions growing
out ot the message of the President, I hope they
will indulge me in a íeply to the remarks of the
gentleman from Ohio, [Mi  Mason,] who haejust
taken his seat, and also to those of the gentleman
from Tennebsce, [Mr   Bell,] who occupied the
floor some days since
If my memory serves me, the gentleman from
Ohio has assumed very different ground in regard
to the Supreme Court, from that occupied by him
some three years ago He then considered this
court an improper tubunal to decide the grave and
highly important question between his own State
and that which i have the honor to represent on
this floor The court then had none of that holy
infallibility now claimed for it It was too insig-
nificant a body to sit in judgment upon the claims
of a sovereign State Congress must decide the
question, and Congress did decide it, wth Ihe
gentleman from Onio acting as one of the judges
This, however, was only a temporary alienation
of mind from the object of his affections. With
that decision, he leturns again to the embraces of
his early love The court is once more restored
to favoi, and looked upon "as the only stay and
support of our institutions," as the only branch
of the Government to which we " can safely trust
the exercise of power " In the opinion of the
gentleman, we ought not hereafter " to go to the
White House to leain constitutional law," or
either Hall of Congress, but to the purlieus of
the Supreme Court There we can hear the re-
sponse of the oracles, and see the priests of the
Constitution ermined with black gowns, and fix-
ing, by then fiat, the destinies of nations Verily,
Ephraim is joined to his idols
I could not agree with the gentleman on the
occasion alluded to, and I cannot agree with him
now So far fiom considering the Supreme Court
" free fiom political bias,"I have long been ¡n the
habit of looking upon it as a political body Its
very organization, the habits of the men who sit
theie in judgment, the nature of the cases which
come before it, all tend to give it a political char-
acter A majority of the Court has at all times
been made up of men claiming the rank of states-
men It is their delight and glory to pass upon
the liberties and immunities of sovereign States; to
bring before them the acts of ministers and gov-
ernors and presidents; to sit in judgment on the
powers of corporations, the validity of contracts,
the rights of war, the nature of treaties, and, in
! fine, upon the very existence of nations These
high powers cannot be exercised without calling
forth political feelings and paity piedilections.
They necessarily make the court a political body,
and of the very worst character for a Republic
■ The members cannot easily be removed for abuse
i of offite, they cannot be operated upon by the
heakhy influence of a sound public opinion, they
| wear their ermine during "good behavior," which,
I being mterpicted, means till death     And this is
