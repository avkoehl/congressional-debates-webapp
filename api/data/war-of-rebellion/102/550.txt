Lieutenant Colonel J. F. McMAHAN,

Commanding Post, Springfield, Mo.:

You will immediately detail thirty-five mounted men of your command, under a competent officer, who will be directed to proceed by forced marches to Humansville and north of that point until he can hear of or strike the trail of the rebels that lately passed through Laclede County, when he will pursue and attack them until they are destroyed. This force will take three days' rations and fifty rounds of ammunition per man and will remain out as long as it can hear of any bushwhackers in the vicinity, subsisting on the country and from such posts as it may visit, the officer in all cases giving proper receipts. This force will start to-night and move until it reaches Humansville.
