positive information can be obtained, it will be forwarded. The general tenor of the statements received make it appear that Jackson's corps is left to guard the passage of the river. Ranson's division, of Longstreet's corps, is one mentioned as gone to Tennessee or South Carolina. Pickett's division is one gone to Charleston; commencing their departure February 17. I shall probably gain more information before night.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN,

Headquarters Defenses:

A large cavalry force has made its appearance in front of our right, said now to be moving toward Stafford Court-House. We send out up the river to try and get between them and the Rappahannock. Can you send out from Catlett's and Rappahannock Stations to intercept them if they move that way? Answer, and advise me what you can and will do.
