bodied male negroes that you can find, and destroy all crops and implements of agriculture that you find below Hernando, where you can do so without delaying your movements. Suffer no pillage of houses or insult to defenseless people. If you should meet a force too large for you, or should you be attacked by superior numbers, send back messengers, and I will send out infantry and artillery. Send back dispatches each day, if you can. It is intended that you shall remain out three days, but that must depend upon circumstances and your own judgment, and your expedition may be extended beyond that time, if necessary.

You will understand that your movement is intended as a strong demonstration, and to attract the attention of the enemy and turn him from gathering his forces on the river, and it is desirable to make the expedition as useful as possible in every particular.

Respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH.

Lieutenant [HENRY] SACHS, Comdg. Detachment 3rd U. S. Cavalry:

You will proceed, with 50 men, detailed by Colonel Morgan, on the Raleigh road to the house of Fletcher Taylor, about 2 miles this side of Raleigh. The negro guide will point out the road and the house of Taylor. You will, if possible, surprise and capture a squad of guerrillas, who, it is reported, will be at Taylor's to-night. From that point you will sweep the country to the WEST of Raleigh, and capture, if possible, citizens named Hurd and Dr. Forrest, who will be pointed out by Mr. Tripp. You will attack and break up any gang of rebels or guerrillas that you may hear of within convenient range of your route, and return and report to these headquarters.

Respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH.

CORINTH, June 17, 1863.

Colonel MERSY:

The FIFTH Ohio and Colonel [Madison] Miller's mounted force will meet Colonel Phillips, as desired. He will, therefore, move to-night. Instruct him to move carefully after he reaches the enemy, and return the moment he considers he has a force he cannot contend with. My information is that there is a considerable mounted force at Okolona. He will follow previous instructions as to property to be taken, and will take everything, as far as possible, that is subject to [illegible] can be
