These jails were ready for the reception of the prisoners the day before instructions were received authorizing me to make the exchange.

Hoping that this explanation will prove entirely satisfactory to the Honorable Secretary of War, as the delay occurred from my anxiety to provide effectual precautions against the escape of the prisoners,

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. G. FOSTER,

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of August 29, ultimo, informing me that you propose discharging ten surgeons, twenty-one assistant surgeons, one hospital steward, and three chaplains of the U. S. military service who have been sent to you as prisoners of war. You further state that while you have accepted as true the statement of these officers as to the positions they claim to hold in our service, you are still required to account for them, and accordingly shall rely upon me to send you an official acknowledgment from the Adjutant-General or other authorized officer of my Government that they actually hold the positions claimed, and that in default of such proof being furnished I shall return them to you within thirty days as prisoners of war. I will receive these gentlemen at the time and place indicated by you, and will retain them within my command until I can furnish you with an official certificate of their positions in our service. I have further to acknowledge your statement of your intention to return, without equivalent, the corporal and private of Company G, Fifty-sixth New York Volunteers, who were captured on the 24th ultimo at Port Royal Ferry under circumstances which you state that you cannot approve.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,
