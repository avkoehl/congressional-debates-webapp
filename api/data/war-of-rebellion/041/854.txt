tured in battle, in some cases compelling us to leave such soldiers in the enemy's hands, or procuring their release on parole eloign,e thus losing their valuable services to the country.

III. The commanding general therefore announces to this command that he shall keep accurate lists of all men captured in the disgraceful manner referred to, and that he shall notify the enemy's commissioner of exchange that he will not exchange such men until all others have been exchanged nor receive them on parole under any circumstances. He has already informed the commanding officer of the enemy that it is his wish that any soldier of this command found robbing outside our lines should be treated like other robbers.

IV. This order is applicable to all arms, but applies more directly to the mounted men, whose conduct in straggling stealing, and maltreating women is a disgrace to the name of American soldier. The officers who permit it are more criminal than the men who perpetrate the crime, and, were proper discipline enforced, would expiate their crime in a prison.

V. The commanding general believes that there is yet self respect enough among the officers of this command to force them to put a stop to these daily outrages. He calls upon them to exercise their authority to its fullest extent, and assures them that they will be fully upheld by him. He directs their attention to the fact the harm done to the enemy by these outrages is as nothing compared with the injury done to the discipline and efficiency of our own troops.

VI. This order will be read to every company of this command.

By order of Major-General Franklin:

WICKHAM HOFFMAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
