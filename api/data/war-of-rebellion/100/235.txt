General HAWLEY,

Wilmington:

No news from Sherman to-day. It is reported by an officer who came from the front last night that Johnston had asked permission to send a messenger through to Lee, to consult with his as to surrender of his (Johnston's) army, and that messenger had gone through. Philadelphia Inquirer of 12th states that Jeff. Davis was captured by Stoneman; not reliable. No news from the North. Will telegraph if any received.

Lieutenant G. L. JOHNSON,

Federal Point:

If the Champion comes from Charleston in time to get up here by sunset, she is to come on. If she could not get up here before to-morrow morning, let her go on immediately to Morehead City. Givethis to the officer commanding troops on board, who is hereby informed that the other brigades, of his division are marching up from here to Goldsborough, and are to be ten miles from here to-night. I shall check them unless he can be on shore here to-night to catch them in the morning. If he cannot he is to go to Morehead, where General Prince had gone.

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
