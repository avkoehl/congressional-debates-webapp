should, with those passing beyond and once enrolled, be compelled to report the fact to such officer connected with the Board of Enrollment of the district as may be designated for the locality in which they reside. In like manner let it be mad the duty of all persons liable to do military duty coming into a district for the purpose of acquiring a residence, or removing from a district with intention to reside elsewhere, to report as aforesaid to the proper officer for enrollment; and it should be made the duty of each district provost-marshal to furnish the provost-marshal of the district from which such new resident had removed with a certificate that he had been duly enrolled, and until such certificate is received let it be unlawful o strike the name of such person from the list. It should be made the duty of the local authorities to furnish the boards of enrollment within whose district they exercise jurisdiction with a monthly or quarterly report of the death of such persons as were liable to the performance of military duty in order that the rolls may be kept continuously correct.

Enrolling officers, assuming them to be men of fidelity and integrity, might safely be instructed not to enroll persons manifestly and permanently disabled, as, from "total blindness," "loss of right eye," "deafness," "loss of a limb or limbs," "permanent lameness," &amp;c.; the particular disabilities which he might act upon could be enumerated after the manner of the list of "disqualifying diseases" now enumerated in the Regulations, or he might be instructed to report the names of such persons upon separate rolls, stating the disability in full for the action of the proper authority. Duty and interest would be combined to secure a reasonably correct enrollment; and by the enactment of a statute making it obligatory upon every male person in the United States who had reached the age rendering him liable to military duty to report himself for registry (or enrollment), as above, and making the neglect to do so a penal offense, punishable, for instance, with disfranchisement until the law was complied with, and in case the names of such persons failing to report for registry should be communicated to the Board through other sources, requiring them if drafted and accepted to serve personally, the desired end might be attained.

The foregoing should apply to all aliens, to persons having conscientious scruples against bearing arms, and to all classes and description of persons, without distinction, whose ages are within the prescribed limits.

The interests of the General Governmhould be kept well up. The migratory character of the population of this country, especially in the Western States, and the anticipated changes in the population of and migration to the Southern States, renders this necessary if it is expected to arrive at the true or even approximate military strength of the Union.

The enrollment and corrections thereto up to April 30, 1865, is as near perfect as possible, under the present system, in the States not engaged in the late rebellion; but, as whatever legislation is taken on the subject of enrollment hereafter must embrace all the States and Territories, it would, in my opinion, be as well to start with a new general enrollment as a basis upon which continuous corrections could be made from time to time and in the manner above contemplated.

The enrollment law was at first considered by a large majority of the people as arbitrary and unjust, and all those concerned in its
