THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
May 29,
is prevalent, not only- tiiroughciut the country,
but lilf&wise here. If.seems to be supposed that
this movement for anew State 1ms been conceived
since the breaking out of' the rebellion, andwasa
consequence  f it—that it grew alone out of the
abhorrence with which the loyal citizens of West
Virginia regarded the traitorous proceedings of
the conspiuitors east of the Alleghanies, and that
the effort was prompted simply by a desire to
dissolve the connection between the loyal and
disloyal sections of the State. Not so, sir. The
question of dividing the State of Virginia, either
by the Blue Ridge mountain, or by the Allegha-
nies, has been mooted for fifty years. It has fre-
quently been agitated with such vehemence as to
threaten seriously the public peace. It has been
a matter of constant strife ami bitterness in the
Legislature of the State. The animosity existing
at this time between the North and the South is
hardly greater than what has at times distin-
guished the relations between East and West
Virginia, arising from a diversity of interests and
geographical antagonisms. Indeed, so incompati-
ble was the union of the territory lying west of
the Alleghany mountains with the territory lying
east thereof, under one and the same State mu-
nicipality, that so long ago as 1781, several of the
States insisted that Virginia should include in her
act of cession all her trans-AUeghany territory,
making the Alleghany mountains her western, as
they were her natural, boundary. A committee
in the Federal Congress about this time, made a
strong report, suggesting such a boundary; and
Mr. Madison records that—
"From several cU'cuinstanee*, iliere was reason to be-
lievo that Uhode Island, Now Jersey, Pennsylvania, and
Delaware, if-not Maryland likewise, retamcd'latent views
of confining Viujiiua to the Alleghany mountains."—Mad-
ison's Debates, vol. 1, pp. 463-465.
And now, sir, I shall, with great brevity, pro-
ceed to adduce some facts showing why this ap-
plication of West Virgin iufor admission as a State
is just and reasonable.
First. Let us consider the population. I have
prepared the following table, showing1 the white
and slave population in each of the forty-four
counties of the proposed new State, and also the
percent, of slave population in each county, ac-
cording to the census of 1860:

Thus, in 1860, the aggregate white population'
was three hundred and thirty-four thousand nine
hundred and twenty-one; and the aggregate slave
population was twelve thousand two hundred and
seventy-one. It is but fair to say that, in conse-
quence of the ravages of the war, the number of
white inhabitants has, perhaps, not increased since
the taking of the census; and the number of the
slaves has, doubtless, diminished two or three
thousand. Thus also it will be seen that the per
cent, of slaves in 1860 was only about four per
cent., and certainly does not nowamountto three
per cent. We have, therefore, the requisite num-
ber of inhabitants.
Secondly. I respectfully solicit the attention of
Senators to the geographical position of the pro-
posed new State. Look at the map. Observe how
this territory lies, like a wedge driven in between
the State of Ohio on one side, and the States ofPenn-
sylvania and Maryland on the other, and is com-
pletely cut off from all convenientintercourse with
East Virginia by the Alleghany mountains, the
sky-kissing summits of which are proposed as the
eastern boundary of the new State. How is it pos-
sible to identify these two sections of the State of
Virginia in a common State policy, or system of
internal improvements, or economical interests?
You have only to examine the geography of the
State to see that this is impracticable. It never
has been done. It cannot be done. Hence the
revenues of the State heretofore, with slight ex-
ceptions, have ail been expended in the construc-
tion of lines of improvement avoiding those im-
passable mountain barriers, and leading to the
south and southwest in directions which have not
only not benefited the northwest section of the
State, (that part contained in the new State,) but
have, indirectly, operated to its serious disadvant-
age. This sectional appropriation of the State's
revenues has long been inveighed against as un-
friendly and unjust, and has engendered bitter
sectional animosity between the counties lying
east and those lying west of the Alleghanies. But,
perhaps, it might be more charitable to attribute
tiiis policy to an absolute necessity growing out
of the utter impracticability of const! ucting any
improvement connecting the two sections of the
State.
Third. This application foradmission as a new
State is predicated on consideiations of industiinl
and commercial necessity. The people living
within the limits of the pi ojected new State never
had, and never can ha\e, any trade or commerce
with Eastern Virginia. There is no means of get-
ting back and forth between the two sections by
any direct and convenient way. There never has
been; there never can be. The impediments are
insuperable. Trans-AUeghany sells nothing to
cis-Alleghany; and vice versa. The trallicand com-
merce between the two sections has not amounted
to fifty thousand dollars in the last twenty years.
The natural and best markets of West Virginia
are Baltimore, Pittsburg, Cincinnati,&c. If East-
ern Virginia were willing to do so, she has not
the ability to push her rail ways and other means of
transportation and travel into the northwest; and
if she had both the will and the ability, all such
improvements in Virginia could only carry the
trade and staples of West Virginia beyond better
and nearer markets.
Fourth. The difference of social institutions
and habits of the people indicate the propriety of
this division of the State. The existence of ne-
gro slavery is said, and I think correctly, by its
fiiends, and by those who own slaves and yet
are not its friends, to require a system of laws and
municipal regulations adapted to the peculiar ne-
cessities and relations necessarily growing out of
that institution. But slavery never can exist to
any considerable extent in the territory proposed
to be embraced in the new State. It never has
flourished there. It never can. The inexorable
laws of climate forbid it. The staple commodi-
ties of the country are not such as in the produc-
tion of them slave labor is valuable. Why, then,
should West Vnginia be forever subjected to a
system of laws and policy adapted to, and indeed
necessary, for a state of society and a class of m-
tcicsts fundamentally different from theirs, and
embarrassing their progress in almost every de- ;
partment of life? Why should the labor of the |
white man of the west be compelled to be regu- !
lated by the policy adapted to the slave labor of i
the east ? i
In making these remarks, I have no reference
to the moral aspects of the slavery question. I
do not wish in this connection to be entangled in
the mazes of argument with which moralists and
religionists have surrounded and involved the
question of slavery. In this respect my opinions
are maturely formed. I have heretofore ex-
pressed them m the Senate. I am now only re-
ferring to slavery and the new State in the light
of a wiseand judicious political economy. Homo-
geneousness of interest, pursuits, and social insti-
tutions is essential to the harmony and prosperity
of every political community. Hence, the utility
and wisdom of our separate State organizations,
exercising municipal authority within their re-
spectivelimits,andadapting their policy to the pe-
culiarities of soil, climate, markets, social habits,
and education existing*within those limits. Our
national Union, embracing such a variety and ex-
tent of all these peculiarities, has found, and must
continue to find, the surest guarantee of its per-
petuity, in the perfect freedom with which each
State in it regulates its own institutions and pol-
icy, in conformity with local exigencies and inter-
ests peculiar to each State. Now, sir, look at
this fact. The total number of slaves in Virginia,
at the last census, was four hundred and ninety
thousand eight hundred and eighty-seven. Of
these, as I have already stated, there were only
twelve thousand seven hundred and seventy-one
—now not more than nine or ten thousand—withm
the boundary of the proposed new State, although
those boundaries include a full third of all the
territory of the State of Virginia. If it were de-
sirable, yet it is utterly impossible, that the num-
ber of slaves in Western Virginia should increase.
Dming the last decade, which may be said to be
the era of slavery propagandism, the number of
slaves in the forty-four counties composing the
territory asking admission in the Union as anew
State actually decreased more than two thousand.
There was a decrease of slaves in neatly all, if
not in every one, of these counties. As I have
said, the geographical position, the climate, the
soil, the staple productions, the demands of labor,
the habits and pursuits, and I may as well add,
the moral and religious sentiments of the people,
fmbid its existence there. The country is mainly
adapted to Ui<e growth of ccieals, to guizmg, and
to manufacturing. Hence slave labor cannot be
profitable there; and for this, if for no other rea-
son, it will never be in demand. Besides, the
extended border of free territory, from the Ken-
tucky line to the upper end of Hancock county,
and thence back again on the other side of the
State to the State of Maryland, makes it impos-
sible to prevent the escape of any adult slave who
wishes to escape.
Mr. President, in view of these considerations,
I think I am authoiized to say that the division
of the State of Virginia asked for, is a physical,
a political, a social, an industrial, and commercial
necessity. It is necessary for the preservation of
haimomous and fraternal relations between the
eastern and western sections of the State. It is
indispensable to the development of the great nat-
ural resources of West Virginia, and to the pros-
perity and happiness of its inhabitants. And now,
sir,
Fifth and lastly. A few words in relation to the
rcsouices of the new State. Its area will be at
least lespoetable—gieater than very many of the
other States of the Union. It will contain about
twenty-four thousand square miles. It will em-
brace immense mineral wealth. It will include
water power more than sufficient to drive all the
machinery of Xew England. It contains thefmest
forests of timber on the continent. It includes
the Great Kanawha salines and the Little Kana-
wha oil wells. It abounds m iron ore; an4 its
coal fields are sufficient to supply the consump-
tion of the entire Union for a thousand years.
Much of it is well adapted to the production of all
the valuable cereals; and all of it is unrivaled for
the growth of grass and forgiazing. The assessed
value of lands and lots in the forty-four counties
of the new State was, in 1859, $71,780,202. I
have prepared a table from the report of the
auditor of public accounts ol Virginia for that
yeor, not having access to one of a more re-
cent date, which I have here, showing this fact
—also showing that the taxes assessed for that
year m these counties amounted to the sum of
$549,565 87:
