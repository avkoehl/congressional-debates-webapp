preparation of the enemy we may expect Forts Morgan, Gaines, &amp;c., to be cut off, and even reduced. If the noncombatants will go away and leave me the place I should feel very little anxiety; but these people are to Virginians; they do not desire their city to be defended, and unless they see a pretty formidable force coming in here they will give me much trouble during my preparations. I am confident of receiving succor in time, but the length and exposed condition of my communications keeps me anxious, and I am only as "cool" as may be expected. God bless and prosper your arms. I feel absolutely confident you will beat Smith.

Your friend, sincerely,

DABNEY H. MAURY.

P. S. -Have you sent to urge Kirby Smith to co-operate with us?
