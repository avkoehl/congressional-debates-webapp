I want you to get your command this side of the Etowah to-night, and come and see me. I will be near the telegraph office.

General SHERMAN:

The Fourth Corps will soon be here. I will get the army over to- night. Have sent to hurry Davis up. What news from Rome?

Major-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Cartersville, October 10, 1864 - 5 p. m.

General STANLEY,Allatoona:

Hood is all across the Coosa, and General Corps reports him, about 2 p. m., advancing in three columns, but since his telegrams are less alarming. I don't think Hood will attack Rome if we can reach Kingston by noon to-morrow, or if he does, he must cross to this side north of the Etowah, and we would have him at great advantage. He may mean to go up to La Fayette, &amp;c., but where he will get his grub is a question. His whole movement is inexplicable to any common sense theory. At Kingston we will be in position to watch him better than anywhere else. I have ordered General Corse to hold Tome to the death, and am, therefore, bound in honor to hasten to his assistance.
