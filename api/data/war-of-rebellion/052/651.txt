HEADQUARTERS RESERVE CORPS, Rossville, Ga., September 15, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. GODDARD,Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: One of my scouts returned this morning from Ooltewah via Missionary Mills, and learned from the people through the country that a rebel force (estimated at two divisions) was at Graysville yesterday afternoon, and supposed to be moving in the direction of Ringgold. I sent out on the Ringgold road before daylight a few mounted infantry some 5 miles. Citizens reported there that four cavalry brigades were encamped near Ringgold. This may be the rear of Buckner's force passing down from East Tennessee.

I would suggest that you send what cavalry you have as far out as Peeler's Mill and Ringgold, and ascertain what force, if any, is in that quarter. Our flank is important just now, and if there is any rebel force in that direction it should be closely observed.

Very respectfully,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General.
