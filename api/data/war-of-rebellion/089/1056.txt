The Enquirer says: "Some thirty-five vessels have appeared off New Inlet, below Wilmington, and among them are reorganized the Colorado and Wabash, and it is inferable that this point is the object of the great expedition which recently left Fort Monroe under Butler and Porter. An official report from General Bragg yesterday states that owing to the severe state of the weather, the enemy off New Inlet have been unable to make any demonstration. He states that he is fully able to hold the city of Wilmington."
