Slavery Question—Mr. Sage.
Ho. of Reps.
deemed to be a mere municipal regulation, founded upon,
and limited to, the range of the territorial laws."
So thought ex-President Fillmore when he
wrote the following letter:
bUFFALO, October 17, 1838.
St*: Your communication of the 13th instant, as chair-
man of the committee appointed by the " Anti-Slavery
Society at'the county of Erie," has just come to hand. You
solicit my answer to the following interrogatories:
I. Do you believe that petitions to Congress on the sub-
ject of slavery, and the slave trade, ought to be received,
read, and respectfully considered, by the representatives of
the people?
i. Are you opposed to the annexation of Texas to this
Union, under any circumstances, so long as slaves are held
therein?
3. Are you in ftvoc of Congress exercising all the consti-
tutional powers it possesses to abolish the internal slave
trade between the States?
Are you in favor of immediate legislation for the aboli-
tion of slavery in the District of Columbia ?
Answer:—1 am much engaged, and have no time to en-
ter into an argument, or explain at length my reasons for
my opinions. I shall, therefore, content myself, for the
present, by answering all your interrogatories in the affirm-
ative, and leave for some future occasion a more extended
discussion on the sutyect.
MILLARD FILLMORE.
So thought ex-Chief Justice Greene C. Bron-
aon, of New York, one of the moat distinguished
jurists in the country, and a leading Democrat of
the Hard school. In a letter dated July 15, 1848,
after declining an invitation to attend a political
meeting, he says:
" Slavery cannot exist where there is no positive law to
uphold it. It is not necessary that it should be forbidden;
it is enough that it is not specially authorized. If the
owner of slaves removes with or sends them into any
country, State, or Territory, where slavery does not exist
by law, they will from that moment become free men, and
will have as good a right to command the master as he will
have to command them. State laws have no extra terri-
torial anthority; and a law of Virginia which makes a man
a slave there, cannot make him a slave in New York, nor
beyond the Rocky Mountains.
" Entertaining no doubt upon that question, I can see no
occasion for asking Congress to legislate against the exten-
sion of slavery into free territory, and, as a question of
policy, I tliink it had better be let alone. If our southern
brethren wish to carry their slaves to Oregon,New Mexico,
or California, they will be under tbe necessity of asking a
law to warrant it; and it will then be in time for the free
States to resist the measure, as I cannot doubt they would,
with unwavering firmness.
" I would not needlessly move this question, as it is one
of an exciting nature, which tends to Bectional division,
and may do us barm as a people. I would leave it to the
slaveholding States to decide for themselves, and on their
own responsibility, when, if ever, the matter shall be agi-
tated in Congress. It may be that they will act wisely, and
never move at all, especially as it seems pretty generally
agreed that neither Oregon, New Mexico, nor Californin,
are well adapted to slave labor. But if our southern brethrea
should make tbe question, we shall have no choice but to
meet it; and then, whatever consequences may follow, I
trust the people of the free States will give a united voice
against allowing slavery on a single foot of soil where it is
not now authorized by law."
It is true that we are not asked to enact laws to
warrant the holding of slaves in the Territories,
but we are called upon to fidmit that slaves may
be rightfully held in the Territories without law.
The very question is made in substance which
Judge Bronson said would leave the people of the
free States no choice but to meet it, whatever con-
sequences might follow.
So thought Colonel Benton in 1854, when,
Speaking of the compromise of 1820, he said that
" it was but a continuation of the same national
feeling, the same national principles, that dictated
the compromise extending the line to the territory
which was then known as the Louisiana pur-
chase.But, sir, what need of my quoting
authorities to prove the power and practice of
Congress over the subject of slavery in the Ter-
ritories ? It is a power that has been exercised
by Congress from the adoption of the Constitu-
tion down to and including this very Congress.
Sir, it is the grasping disposition of the South to
extend slavery into the Territories, and with it to
rule the Government in the future, as it has done
in the past, that we have to meet; and while I
regret the necessity to enter into such a conflict,
now that, the South has reopened it with renewed
bitterness, sectionalism, and violence, I shall not
shrink from any responsi bility that it may impose
upon me in combating it.
Mr. Chairman, having presented such facts as
1 deem sufficient to establish the power of Con-
fress over the subject of slavery in the Territories,
proceed to speak briefly of the opinions and tes-
timony of some of the fathers of the Republic,
and the ablest and most cherished of our recent
statesmen, against the evils of slavery and its.
further extension. In 1786 General Washington
said:
"I never mean, unless some particular circumstances
should compel me to it, to possess another slave by pur-
chase, it being among my first wishes to see some plan
adopted by which slavery in this country may be abolished
bylaw."
Said Jefferson, in his Notes on Virginia:
" The whole commerce between master and slave is a
continual exercise of the most unremitting despotism on
theoue part, and degrading submission on the other." * *
*   " With what execration should the statesman be loaded
who, permitting one half of the citizens thus to trample on
the nghts of the other, transforms those into despots and
these into enemies, destroys the morals of the one part and
the amor patrue of the other! Can the liberties of a nation
be thought secure, when we have removed their only firm
basis—a conviction in the minds of the people that these
liberties are the gift of God—that they are not violated but
by bis wrath ? Indeed, I tremble for my country when I
reflect that God is just, and his justice cannot sleep for-
ever."
In addition to this, I hold in my hand a copy
of a letter written by Mr. Jefferson, only six
weeks before his death, in which he reiterates nil
of his former opinions and views of the subject
of slavery, and declares, that, " living or dying,
they will ever be in my most fervent prayers."
I regard this letter as one of the most important
and valuable of the papers left by Jefferson. It
reads as follows:
Monticello, May 30, 1826.
Dear Si*: Persuasion, perseverance, and patience are
the best advocates on questions depending upon the will of
others. The revolution in public opinion which this case
requires is not to be expected in a day, or perhaps in an age;
but time, which outlives all things, will outlive tkis evil also.
My sentiments have been forty years before the public.
Had I repeated them forty times, they would have only
become tbe more stale and threadbare. Although I shall
not live to see them consummated, they will not die with
me; but living or dying, tbey will ever be in ray most fer-
vent prayers. This is written for yourself, and not for the
public, in. compliance with your request for two lines of
sentiment on the subject.
Accept the assurance of my good will and respect,
THOS:JEFFERSON.
In Mr. Webster's celebrated MarshfLsld speech,
in 1848, he said:
" I feel that there is nothing unjust, nothing of which any
honest man can complain, if he is intelligent, and I feel that
there is nothing of which the civilized world, if they take
notice of so humble an individual as myself, will reproach
me when 1 gay, as I said the other day, that I have made
up ray mind, for one, that under no circumstances will I
consent to tbe extension of the area of slavery in the United
States, or to the further increase of slave representation in
the House of Representatives."
. And again, in 1850: .
" Sir, wherever there is a particular good to be done—
wherever there is a foot of land to be staid back from be-
coming slave territory—I am ready to assert the principle
of the exclusion of slavery."
Said the noble old statesman qf Kentucky,
Henry Clay, in 1850:'
" I have said that I never could vote for it myself; and I
repeat, that I never can and never will vote, and no earthly
power ever will make me vote, to spread slavery over terri-
tory where it does not exist."
With this declaration of Mr. Clay I take my
stand. It was my privilege to be one of his hum-
ble but true supporters wnile living—even when
Kentucky and the South forsook him in the na-
tional convention at Philadelphia in 1848; and
now that he is dead, I revere his memory, and
will defend his illustrious fame.
Mr. Chairman, having spoken of the causes
and objects of the slave power in the present crisis,
and given the action of Congress, the decisions
of the courts, and the opinions and views of Jef-
ferson, Webster, Clay, Fillmore, Bronson, and
Benton, respecting the power of Congress over
the institution of slavery, and its extension into
the Territories, I'beg the attention of the commit-'
tee for a short time while I proceed to speak of
the results of the acquisition of territory by the
United States, and the manner of its disposal.

TERRITORY. *
Fifteen slave States contain  928,894 square miles.
Fifteen free States contain  454,344 - do.
Difference  474,556
The fifteen slave States have now above five
times the extent of territory, according to pop-
ulation, that the free States have. Including
slaves and all, they have about three times the
territory of the free States, according to popula-
tion:
Nine slave States have been added,
containing  722,922 square miles.
Six free States have been added,
containing  290,264 do.
Difference    433,658
do.
I have given the cost of the purchased territo-
ries, the disposition of the same, the population
of -the free and slave States, together with the
extent of-, the entire territory embraced in said
States in the Union, omitting California, as she
was admitted without coBt, and I may say by
accident. It is also true she was admitted as a
free State; but her Senators and Representatives
soon learned ia whose hands the power of this
Government is held, and have ever-been, politi-
cally, the allies of the slave States. California
" forms no part of the territory where the strug-
gle for and against the extension of slavery has
