ing. On Sunday morning he determined to go down the Potomac and ordered me as I understood to my own vessel, instead of which I was taken back to the sloop and sent off to Baltimore, they leaving my vessel in charge of a man, and at Fort McHenry I was landed and delivered up to General Banks and in charge of Major Morris.

General Dix arrived about that time, and at my instance on telling him the condition of my vessel, my only means of support, he promised to look into the matter. Meantime orders for transfer of the prisoners there to Fort Lafayette being sent on, I was transferred to this place and have had no opportunity of having my case presented to Government, while my family are suffering. The truth of all I say can readily be verified. I have never at any time had complicity or in any way knowingly done anything which I could not openly do with knowledge of the Federal authorities, and all who know me can testify that I have not interested myself in the present trouble so far even as to discuss them. I have at no time either said or done anything knowingly to which the authorities could take exceptions, and when I took these persons as passengers I had no suspicion that the parties were other than what were represented, and upon the errand stated. Upon this statement of facts, which can be established, I sincerely hope that I will be released of facts, which can be established, I sincerely hope that I will be released from a confinement so burdensome to my family, dependent upon my labor.

I am, sir, most respectfully, your obedient servant,

CHARLES M. HAGELIN.
