and his party, reported to me from a point near Salem, at 2 p. m. yesterday, that Jefferson Davis crossed the Apalachee River six miles above Furlow's Bridge, at a ford, about 11 p. m. of the 7th instant, and passed through Fairplay about 11 a. m. yesterday, taking a southwesterly course from Fairplay. Davis had about 250 men with him, and apparently intended to cross the Yellow River south of a battalion I had at Covington. That battalion had previously been ordered to guard the fords, ferries, and bridges of the Ulcofauhatchee and Yellow Rivers as far south as Planters Factory. General Wilson's force, along flint River from Jonesborough southward, should be notified. The Fifteenth Pennsylvania is in pursuit.

Direct everybody north from Jonesborough to be on the qui vive.
