ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL,

Department of the South:

I have received dispatches from Augusta stating that there are a large number of colored refugees coming in daily and that there is positively no adequate means of feeding them. Also that, by abandoning their homes and plantations at this season, crops upon the same are endangered. I would ask what shall be done to meet the difficulty. Would the major-general commanding approve of having all refugees who come to Augusta required to return to their homes until some provision be made for them, or some policy with regard to them is worked out?
