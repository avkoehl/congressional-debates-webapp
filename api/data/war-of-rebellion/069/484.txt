HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,June 2, 1864-12.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER:

COLONEL: I have continued General Gibbon's line to the left of the road by Brooke's brigade, and am putting in Miles on his left; swing forward my left to find the enemy's works, and rest my left on the right bank of the Chickahominy, if possible. I have made no developments of importance as yet.

Respectfully,

FRANCIS C. BARLOW,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,June 2, 1864-1.10 p. m.

Brigadier General F. C. BARLOW,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: Your dispatch of 12.15 p. m. received. The major-general commanding instructs me to say that it is not expected that you can reach the Chickahominy. If you should do so, however, it is very well, but it is arranged that the cavalry shall assist in picketing the left. The major-general commanding orders that you will look well to your left, as it is the critical point. Colonel Morgan has been sent out to show you the position.

Your obedient servant,

FRANCIS A. WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION, SECOND CORPS,June 2, 1864-5 p. m.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER:

COLONEL: I have the honor to report that I have formed my two largest brigades in line of battle, on the left of the road, and have swung forward the left so as to form much less than a right angle with the road. The enemy's line of skirmishers in very strong.
