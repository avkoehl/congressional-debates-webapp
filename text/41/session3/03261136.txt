THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 11,
Maryland objects, and it cannot be called up
now, as the pension bills are regularly before
the Senate.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I insist on the regular
order.
Mr. RAMSEY. I appeal again to the Sen-
ate to allow this matter to be disposed of. I
offered a resolution a few days ago to have an
evening session for this purpose, and one
objection does not carry it over. I call up the
resolution, and ask for a vote upon it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That would be
very true if it were called up in the morning
hour; but the clock'indicates to the Senator
from Minnesota, as well as to the Chair, that
the time in w.hich the resolution could prop-
erly be called up has passed, the morning hour
having been consumed in debate. The Sen-
ator from Vermont will now indicate the first
bill that he desires to call up.

Mr. EDMUNDS. I ask the Senate to pro-
ceed with the Senate pension bills in the order
in which the Secretary has them on his table,

The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the Chair will regard the motion of
the Senator from Vermont as agreed to, and
the pension bills will be taken up iu their

Mr. ED51UNDS. I see there is a clerical
omission in this bill in drawing it up by the
Clerk. It should read that the Secretary of
the Interior is authorized and directed to place
the name of this lady on the pension-rolls
" subject to the conditions and limitations of
the pension laws." I move that those words

poses to relieve them from the payment of
taxes assessed against them upon property
which was burned. The bill has passed the
House of Representatives and been reported
favorably by the Committee on Finance in
the Senate. I see that the Senator from
New York, [Mr. Fenton',] the member of
the Finance Committee who reported the bill,
is in his seat.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I am obliged to insist on
the regular order.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator
from Vermont insists on the regular order. By
the unanimous order of the Senate, this day
was assigned for the consideration of reports
of three committees, but it is of course sub-
ject to unanimous consent for other proposi-
tions. Perhaps at a later period of the day
the Senator from Missouri may obtain consent
to act on the bill to which he refers from the
other gentlemen who have charge of business
during the day.
