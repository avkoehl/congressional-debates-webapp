on the State banking institutions, calculated to de-
stroy their c¡ edit and usefulness This, if true,
was a gra\e charge, and therefore required some
considerat on An attack must be an infringe-
ment of some vested right, or a course of treatment
so manifestly against the public good as to partake
of wantonness and immorality, or a spirit of re-
venge Was any right of thsse institutions pro-
posed to be infringed upon1 Did their charters,
granted by ihe State, for fived and specified pur-
poses, include among those purpose? the safe keep-
ing, or profitable use, of the money of the whole
countiy? Was there a provision that they shoull
be fiscal agents of the National Treasury, or that
then credit should be sustained by the money and
credit of the people of the United States' No No
such provision was ever heard of in ihe charter of
any State bank No right of the institutions was,
then, infringed, by withholding from them bo'h
the keeping and use of the public money
Was any faith, or confidence, due from this Go-
vernment to the States, or to these institutions of
their creation, violated by the proposed separation''
The States had chartered banks for particul? r loca-
tions, with capilals such as the locations seemed to
demand, but would any one pretend that, m grant-
ing these charters, the S'ate Legislatures had count-
ed upon the money m the National Treasury, or
the credit of the Federal Government, to sustain
and make useful the banking institutions to which
they were giving life and power, as banks of r-sue
and discount? Did any State Legislature ever, b>
word or deed, cause it to be undei-tood, eit! er
by the people, or the institutions, that banks of
their creation were mere skeletons, poweiless and
helpless, and that the life and health-giving pnnci-
ple was to be breathed into th<=m- by an extensor of
the patronage of the Federal.Gov ernment, in the
shape of a profitable use of its money, and a com-
mand of its confidence and credit? Never. Had
the Federal Government, br any act, or expression,
authorized ?n expeciation of this patrjnage and
confidence, except upon condtt ons which had been
violated by the banks, and had thus torced a sepa-
ration between them and the treasure of the coun-
try? He was aware of no such<<ct or expression
The separation exists, awl has been torced uoon
the ra'ion by the banks tr-mseives, and the simple
ques'ion is, shad ver new ? In whai s nse
can the dei.is.ion ot thii q testion nowe  r t'^td-
cisión may Le made, be m a *ick upon the bi-d -~i
The'dea was a mista'en one, and tht objec i n
any light in which it cand be v eutd, v i.s u 1-
founded and unjust
He proposed, however, for the purpose of .' i ■
trating the truth of thiN concluyen and making it
moie clear, to call to the maids 01 Senators a s n-
gle chapter in our financial histon Duiing lort/
years of the existence o' (he Government, under
the Federal Constitution, a national bank had been
,n existence, and, he spile from recollection, but
he believed the national bamt had been, ¡or the
whole period, the exclusive depository ot the pub
he money, and the exclusve fiscal asent ot the
Treasury He was sure it was so dunns the
twenty years'existence of the last national bank,
and he thought it was so under the old bank Then
the State banks were not dei; ositones of the na
tional treasure, nor fiscal agents of the National
Treasury, and had it evei been asseited that th s
leg slat on w as an attack upon these institutions,
or that their ciedit and usefulness were fheiebv de-
stroyed? But a<*ain during the existence ot the
last Bank oí the United States the notes of the Slate
banks weie not disbursed to the public creditors at
all, and were not receivable m payment of the pub
'ic dues but at the pleasure ot the national bank,
and then, as every bank hank receives the notes
of its neighbor institution, to take them out of cir-
culation, and return them prompth, to be con-
verted into specie 01 specie funds Did these State
institutions languish and die under this Congression-
al legislation! Did they not i ather take root aid flou-
rish, and become sound, and stable, and useful' Has
not a large and powerful political party in this coun-
try ever contended that the checks and restraints,
exercised by the national bmk, during this period
over the State institutions, weie saiutau andpu-
pert   That it was a great balance wheel, regulating
and equa ising ihe movement of the whole complex
machinery? What is proposed by the bill, but 'hat,
to the extent of us operations, the National Trea-
sury shall form trie same check and restraint upon
the local banking institutions' That it shall keep
the pub'.c money independent of them? That it
sha'l e ther not receive their notes in payment of
ttie public dues, or receiving, «hall frequently pre-
sent them for conversion into specie, or specie
furds? Ihe only difference w Jl be that the Trea-
Nury ill r< t entr-r mío competition with the loeal
bants m the business of baniung, that it will leave
that whole field to them, and merely content itself
« ah a sound currency for Us transactions How,
then, is it possible that those who saw such b^mgn
influences to the local institutions from the whole-
some restraints of a national bank, should see such
baneful effects to folio v the same influences, when
flowing from the public Treasury' should see
there an attack upon the institution , a prostration
of their credit, and a total destruction of their use-
fulness?
He was aware that the S}Stem proposed was
new, and substantially untried, so far as the legis-
lation and the practice of our Government was
concerned, and it would be admitted by all, that, as
a new measure, it had met the full share of denun-
ciation to which almost all changes from establish-
ed custom, almost all reforms, however valuable
and useful, are destined to meet, when presented in
the mere shape of proposit ons for the acceptance
of the public it was not his habit to speaK dis-
respect! ullj hereof the actions or the motives of any,

but be must «a/ that he had never seen moreactive,
zea'ous, and persevering efforts to forestall public
opinion upon any measure of legislation, than had
been used tow aids this, from the appearance of the
Message oí the President, at the extia session, to
the prese it hour. He had seen this with the more
deep regret, because some of the most respectable,

He w^uld not say th-t these weie the consequences
o. the State bank deposi'e system He had said
upon that point all he intended to say, but it was
maiter of history that these disasters had come upon
the countrv under the pract cal opeiation ot tha

and the banks, as a general remark, were recover-
ing trom their late excesses, and preparing tor a
speedy n sumption of specie pavments Such
see-med to be me lustoiy oi our bus ness prospects
at the present moment.   He did not mention these
things to ascribe them to the operations of the Na-
tional Treasury, or to the manner in which those
operations had been conducted since the suspension
of the banks, bat to prove that the practical opera-
t on of a system for the management of our
finances, such as is substantially provided for by
the bill, had not had the effect to retard and defeat
these great and beneficial business results, nor to
repress the immense energies, and to cripple the
vast resources, of our extended country
Surely, then, so far as experience has afforded
evidence, it offers no cause for discouragement to
the friends of the measure, arid inasmuch as
opinions beyond that, wnether favorable or unfa-
vorable, are lit 'e more than conjecture, the op-
posers of tie bill should net elemand of us to sur-
render our favorable judg nent, though thus slight-
ly tested, in favor of a measure which repeated ex-
periment, both m adversity and in prosperity, has
proved to be delusive and dangerous
The next objection he proposed to notice was,
tiat the operations of the bill would be to separate
the Gov crnm nt from the people, and to secure a
sound currency for the public officers, and a base
currency for the countrv.
This, again, was a startling objection, and re-
quired examination Its first assumption was, that
the tendency of the measure under discussion
wéuld be to separate the Government of the coun-
tiy from the people ot ihe country, to elevate the
former and depress the latter, and the second was,
that the separation w ould be marked by a differ-
ence in the value of the currency tobe provided for
and secured to each Had either of these assump-
tions any fo jndat'on n fact, or even in fair appre-
hersion?
lie had al"ead^ attemnted to show, and thought
he had succeeded in shoAme, that the financial
svstem proposed by th  bill was preferable to the
State bank deposite sj-stem in the following re-
spec s, name!) n the safetv it afforded to the
public moneys ¡n the expanses and risks attending

the banking ins ltutions themselves, m the limita-
tions of patronage added to  he Executive branch
of the Government, m the independence it secures
to the Government financially, and the exemption
it confers from injurious mnpntations, and in its
tendency, to the full extent of the operations of the
National Treasury, and of the exertion of all the
constitut ona! pouer ot this Gove-ament, to pro-
duce and maintain a sound and stable currency for
rl,e w hoi  countrv If he had succeeded in esta-
blishms h sepos tions, would it, couid it, be said,
that a sj stem possessing such advantages was cal-
culated to produce separation and alienation be-
tween the peep'e ot the country and the Govern-
ment ol then choice'    lie could not believe it
Buf the o'jj"ctm ?«uppil tiat mis spparation
Wu.sto grew ou* ot the difierent currencies pro-
duced ler the Government and ¡¡le peoi'e, by the
necessary action of the system That the eSect of
the bill would be, and h as intended to be, to pro-
duce and rriamti n a umtorm ana sound currency
for the Notional Treasury, and for all who might
have demands upon it, as «ell the officers of the
Government as oihers, was most freely admitted
Indeed this was claimed as one of the principal
ments of t e swem But did it follow- that, be-
cause 'h  bill h >d this t ndency it would therefore
tend te debase l^" geneial currenci of the people?
Certain' no No such conseqi ence followed
On tl e contian it hid been aiieidi ¿-ho * n tint, so
far as it sj ould evert any mfience upon tne general
cunency, th it influence must be io raise that cur-
rent to a level with that secured to the Treasury
Ir, then, the peop'e w ere to hav e a base currenct,
they were to have it, not n coispquence olthe bill,
but >t at lance of n, thev wen to receive it, not
from tne pub'c Treason, but from their own
State banks, no t-ora the evils of the legislation of
Congress, but frc m the ev lis of State legislation
Did any ore pretend tbat the bill could exert an in-
fluence to debase anv portón of the currency uptn
which it had i o direct action? He had not heard
it so con'ended, a" i Le felt sure that no such posi-
tion would be assumed If the uiTency up  n
Which it ds 1 diicdv act, and «be standard oi wrLuh
it regulated, were 'o be base, then it might be well
