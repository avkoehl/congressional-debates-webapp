The Third Corps is halted in front of this position in line of battle, about a mile the river, with skirmishers on the wooded crest in its front. The bridges here are about completed. I am ready to cross and await orders. Wright is on the other side. We captured 8 battle-flags yesterday.

Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps:

The Eighth Illinois has just returned from a reconnaissance down the railroad to Rapidan Bridge. They could not see the bridge without exposing themselves too much. Nothing was found on this side save a few scouts. The river was visited at several points. Strong pickers were discovered on the other side at each point. Rodes' division crossed at Raccoon; no troops crossed below. The civilians all say that the rebel army was much frightened, and never saw it in so much confusion. The First U. S. Cavalry started out this morning on a reconnaissance to Robertson's River and beyond, if practicable. It has not returned. When last heard from it was near Robertson's River. A regiment of Devin's went toward Madison Court-House. No report from it yet. My impression is that Lee's army has gone farther south than the line of the Rapidan.

JNO. BUFORD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
