THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 12,
gressional aid. Without such aid they might
have been to-day the humble homes of fisher-
men instead of the marts of commerce.
Mr. ELD RIDGE. Will the gentleman yield
to me for a word?
Mr. HA1G-HT. I hold the floor by the court-
esy of my colleague, [Mr. Bird.] If he docs
not object I will yield for a moment.
Mr. BIRD. Certainly.
Mr. ELDIIIDGE. I will not occupy the
time of the gentleman. I will simply say in
regard to Milwaukee, which is ill the State in
which I live, although not in my district, the
people of that city built their city and improved
their harbor mostly with their own money.
Mr. HAIGHT. I believe Milwaukee has
received some aid and assistance from Con-
gress for the improvement of her harbor. I
could find, if I had time, papers authentica-
ting the expenditure of large amounts of
public money for said improvements, although
perhaps not the aggregate amount that was
asked.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. We want more, and more
is needed.
Mr. HAIGHT. I have no doubt of that.
Mr. ELDIIIDGE. They are now trying to
get Congress to pay them back the money they
advanced and expended years ago. I have no
doubt it ought to be refunded.
Mr. HAIG-I1T. That they want all they can
get, and will keep all they can get, I have no
doubt. While my remarks are applicable to
Milwaukee, they have an equal force in refer-
ence to most of the harbors and rivers of the
western States. My friend from Wisconsin
champions the right of petition by the pre-
sentation of memorials for the improvement
of the harbors, lakes, and rivers of the great
West. For this, I have no doubt, his constit-
uents will commend him.
But this side divertisement almost distracted
my attention from a point to which I desired
to especially direct the attention of the com-
mittee j that is, the boundless donation of the
public domain for the development of the re-
sources of the West, Southwest, and the Pacific
coast. I hold in my hand the report of the
Commissioner of the General Land Office for
the year 1869. From the tables therein con-
tained I find that the Congress of the United
States, with a prodigality unexampled in the
history of any nation, has freely donated the
public domain whenever they supposed they
could receive ample return for such prodigality.
In support of this statement I herewith annex
the table referred to in said report:
No. 11.—Statement exhibiting land-concessions by acts of Congress to States and corporations for railroad and military wagon-road purposes
from the year 1850 to June 30, 1869.
