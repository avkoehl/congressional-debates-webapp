The question being on ordering the bill as
amended to be read a third time,
Mr. KELSEY. I call for the reading of the
engrossed bill.
The SPEAKER. This is a Senate bill, and
does not require to be engrossed.
The bill was read a third time.
Mr. HOAR. I ask that by unanimous con-
sent the words "or implied" be struck out.
It is very manifest that there would' be no agree-
ment to which those words would be applicable.
There being no objection the amendment
was agreed to.
Mr. KELSEY. I call for the yeas and nays

Mr. SARGENT, by unanimous consent, pre-
sented a report of a minority of the Committee

baltimore and potomac railroad.
Mr. STONE, from the Committee for the Dis-
trict of Columbia, reported back with iimetid-
ments a bill (S. No. 425) to extend the time
for the completion of the lateral branch of the
Baltimore and Potomac railroad, authorized
by the act approved February 5, 1867, and to
change the location in the city of Washington
along the bank of the canal.
The bill was read. The preamble recites that
a charter was granted by act of Congress
approved February 5,1867, giving to the Balti-
more and Potomac Railroad Company tlie
privilege of constructing a lateral branch of
their railroad into the District of Columbia and
the city of Washington; that under the act the
time lor the completion of the lateral branch
was within four years from the passage of the
act; that the work on the line of the road within
the city of Washington is very heavy and will
consume along time in its construction, and
that the work has already been delayed by
submitting the plans and location to Congress
for their approval. The bill provides for the
repeal of the seventh section of the act to au-
thorize the extension, construction, and use of
a lateral branch of the Baltimoreand Potomac
railroad into and within the District of Colum-
bia ; and the time for the completion of the
lateral branch of the Baltimore and Potomac
railroad is extended to the 1st day of February,
1875. The second section authorizes the com-
pany to adopt a line in the city of Washington
from South Fourth street, curving to the right,
either to the north or south bank of the canal,
northwestwardly to Virginia avenue.
The amendment reported by the committee
was read, as follows:
In section two striko out all after the enacting
clause, and insert in lieu thereof the followiner:
Xhat the said company, if it shall so eleet, is hereby
authorized to adopt a line in the city of Washington
from some point west of east fourth street in the
line designated in the act of Congress approved
March 18, 1800, as passin? along south K street,
thence crossing to and passing along tho south bank
of the canal to south Capitol street, and thence
northwestwardly to Virginia avenue, there inter-
secting and passing along the line dcsci'ibed in said
act approved March Is, 1SGJ, as passing along Vir-
ginia avenue northwestwardly to the intersection
of south O and west Jfinth streets.
Mr. STONE. 1 can explain the amendment
in a few words. It does not make any mate-
rial change in the bill, but merely changes the
phraseology. The bill describes one of the
streets as11 south Fourth street,'' when it should
be " east Fourth street.f)
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. STONE. I move the previous ques-
tion.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the bill was ordered to be read a
third time; and it was accordingly read the
third time, and passed.
Mr. STONE moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed ; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. COBURN. I ask the gentleman from
Maryland to yield to me for some remarks upon
this bill.
Mr. STONE. How long does the gentle-
man desire?
Mr. COBURN. Half an hour.
Mr. STONE. I prefer to give an explanation
of the bill myself first.
Mr. COBURN. I wish a part of the time.
I do not think a bill of this importance ought
to pass without discussion. I suggest that, the
bill contains an appropriation.
The SPEAKER. Does the gentleman make
that point of order?
Mr. COBUBN. I do.
Mr. STONE. It does not make any appro-
priation.
Mr. COBURN. It does appropriate money
by continuing and renewing the unexpended
balances.
Mr. WELKER. There is an old appropri-
ation for building a jail, which by one of the
sections is continued for the same purpose. It
is good now.
Mr. COBURN. "Why continue it if it is
good? If so, it is not an appropriation that
needs renewing.
rheSPEAKER. The gentleman who makes
the point of order will please point out the
portion of the bill on which he grounds it.
Mr. COBURN". My point of order has ref-
erence to that portion of the fifth section which
providesâ€”
That the unexpended portion of the appropriation
heretofore made by the act of July 25, I860, for the
