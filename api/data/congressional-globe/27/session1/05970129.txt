Rather, why dcs he not look at home, and ask if
he ib not ashamed for charging thp debt tnat this
loan bill is to satisfy, on ihe past Administra ion,
instead of the present one, or instead of Corgrest?
A debt wbicn if for this year tha Adoitmstr tion
avoided, and would have continued to avoid, and
which, if foi this j ear, has be°n incurred by this
Adtmnistratii n, f>rough too lavish expenditures
since March, and by large new appropriations
passed and to be passed by its recommendation
and friends at the present session' A debt, also,
which, however incurred, I have still be n ready
and eager to give ample meana to discharge, if he
new Chancellor of the Exchtq ler wou'd be con-
tent n h s zeal, and not overleap thp mark, and
not ask twice me amount necessary for that pur-
pose, or not eno lgh for both this ?nd the debt ot a
future year
When the 'anff bi 1 is offered, I am equally
willing to adopt measures tor de'iayin,  the debt
not due till next year—a debt wh ch I admit ongi-
nated under the l«ws of th  pa t Admin strauon,

tion is scrutinized, the i-ss v  ih it be found guilty

Mr WOODBURY Most cer'amly Con-
gress can pabs any appropriation it deems
proper and constitutional, and it is is duty
to pass a.y one of that character, wheth-r

same time, does ncu the Senator «e —cannot he
understand—that if Corgress passe more aopro
pnation, tnan are included m the ctmats and
beyond the means computed, it al o become its
duty, a most impera! ve duty, forthwith ie pioviJe
addiuonal means to defray them' Can he, to
use his own largua?e, elevate his nmJ, and reach
the true iipmy oj feeling as a legislator, so as lo b 
ashamed to pass such alditunil appr-piia
tions, witnout immediately providing me addi-
tional means to discharge them'? Can he be
so absurd and unjust, as wJl 8" ungene-
roas, as to censure an agent for not being
able to pay thirty mill oas of appropriations, \ hen
he was furnished with bat twenty fivp mi'Unsof

were refused, [Mr. Calhoun ]   A second apphca-
tion was successfu , and if it bad not been, he (Mr
B ) intended to sny to his exhausted friends, " Go
and get your dmnei i—take some rrfi e'hment—s'mj as
long as you please—/ am going to take the floor—I
have been reserving and reposing myself for this exigen-
cy I am fi esh and vigorous, and when you come back
you will find me on my feet" Thr; is what he would
have said and done ii the debate had bseu continued
on Saturday mgbt, but, happilv, the second motion
for an adjourn meat prevailed, and the privilege of
speaking m the day time, and within the accus
tomed hours of bus ness, was thus obtained for
himself and friends. Mr B said his health was
excellent, and be was able to come early, and sit
lai«, and work hard by night, or by day, as the oc-
casion might require An exuberant s'ate of
health enabled him to do all this, and, having
mentioned his health, he would show himself
thankful for that blessing, and willing to be ser-
viceable to others, in iollowjng the example of
which the chamber had been witness, by indulging
in an episode upon auto hygieinal strategy, and
thus illuminate the Senate upon the art of self-
health preservation. Otheis had tcld their prac-
tice, and he would tell his. His practice was thif
He gave his little boy a Greek and Latm leison
before he came to the Senate every morning, ard
he gave his little girls lessons in French and Spa-
nish every evening after he went home from the
Senate, and, thus doing, he enjoyed not only an
exuberant, but almost an extravagant state of
health. He mentioned this for the benefit of the
Senate in general, and of the bachelor Senators m
particular
Mr B sa d, that notwithstanding the lesson he
had learned from a lmie French comedy, begin-
ning with Ihe moving supplication, "who will de-
liver us from the Greeks and the Romans"—qui nous
dplnrera des Grees et des Romams—notw lthstand ng
that les on he ft.lt himselt justified, under this pnr-
ticulpr Administration, to refer to these o'd friends
of his'choil dav memoiy, and mention an incident
a hh.h was a characteristic of one of them, and
weich commentators have considered as one of
lue main ca' ses of their invincibility. He spoke
of the Romans, ana of the Senatorial vote of
thanks to the surviving Consul after the battle
of Cannae, because he had not despaired of the
Republic This vote proven ted despair in others—
reanimated confidence—and Ted to victory Th s,
Mr B said, was the incident in the history of his
old fr ends, the Romans, which he now took leave
to recal to the recollection of the Sena'e And
now for the application of this historical inci-
dent. The application was to the American
Democracy, who had suffered a sort of Can-
eas defeat last fall, but who did not despair of
the Republic, and are already on the high road to
victory ' We were called here, said Mr B —call
ed to this extraordinary session—as the vanquished
would be called into the presence of the conqueror
in barbarian times—to receive the law and the lath,
and to be stripped of their clothes and arms We
were called up to have the yoke fitted on our necks,
and the chains and manacles fastened on our
hands and feet, and to see our friends persecuted,
andourcmntry p liaged by corporations, natives
and loreigners. We were tailed, and we came—
not as slaves, but as Romans' not in despair, but
with hearts of courage, and nerves of iron' notas
to the place ot punishment and humiliation, but as
to the field of glory and victory' I crossed the
Mississippi, said Mr B on the 15th of May, in
obedience to the President's proclamation to repair
to this city, and I cade, what I telt to be, a tri
umphil march to tins Capitol' I looked at
otters, not myself I lco'-ed  o the proud
anay of Democracy on this floor, I looked
to th  twenty one Democratic Senators here,

have shown themselves lo b«. Sir, 1 have -ome ex-
perience m parliamentary warlare, 1 have <ome
knowledge ot history, 1 know something of the
conflicts, bodily and intellectually, ot my species,
and I can boldly say, that the annals of the hu-
man race present no example 5f a talent, of a pa-
triotism, ot a conrage, of % rtevo'edness, in any deli 
b rauive body of rat n that has e rer existed, which l?
>-uperior to that which ree have seen m the twentv-
onu Democratic Senators who sustain the cause of
tbetr country at this most ominous and perilous
extraordinary session of oar Congress The annals
of mte lectual warfare present no example of men-
tal effort superior lo their protracted, victorious,
and magnificent debate
Proceeding to the examination of his subject,
Mr B said- We have now advanced a distance,
and rt ached a point, at which we may halt—look
back, and survey the ground over whiclwwe have
passed. We are now in th? second quarter of the
new Administration, s.nd in the second month of its
first session of Congress, and enough has been
done, or attempted to be done, to show wbat it is,
and what it will be The tree ,s known by its
fruit, and we now have fiuit enough, or buds and
b ossoms enough, to show us what manner of tree
this new Administra on is—to what genus it be-
longs, and for what it is good, and I believe it will
be found, upon the View of its fruit and buds, to bo
of that prolific and poioonous species which the
naturalists call the bohun upas
We were told shortly before the termination of
the last session of Congress, by a gentleman, then a
member of this budy, row a member of the new
cabinet, (Mr Webster ) that a new set of books
were to be opened at the Trea^uiy ffter tha 4ih
day of March that the new Administraren would
take a new point of departure and, for the purpose
of discriminating between economy and extrava-
gance, they would clo<-e up the old oeoks of the two
pa-t Administrations, and open a new set upon
their own account, for the operations of the new
powers. This is what we uere toll, an I now let
us take a peep into these new I lok , and see the en-
tries which have betn made, or propos-ed to be
made, in them
It will be rccollec'ed that the past Administra-
tion was charged with expending forty millions of
dollars per annum for the expanses of the Govern-
ment, and the new Administration were to defray
the expenses of the same Government with the
one third part of that sum, namely with thirteen
millions of dollars. I will not Hop to vindicate
the past Administration from the injurious imputa-
tion of expending forty millions in defia) ing the ex-
penses of the Government that task was per-
formed above a year ago in this chamber, and to
the conviction ot all present—friends and foes.
It was then proved by a document from the Trea-
sury Department, the verity of which no member
could impeach, that, of these imputed forty mil-
lions, above twenty of them went to the great ob-
ject of freeing the Southern and Western States
from the incumbrance of their Indian population-
holding treaties with them—extinguishing their
territorial titles—removing ¡hem to the West—
maintaining the war in Fltnda— and lo the further
object ot redeeming Treasury note —constructing
permanent public builomgs, and paying over in-
demnities obtained irom foieign count íes, and,
that all which went to the expenses of the Go-
vernment did not exceed seventeen or eighteen
millions of do'Urs I will not stop to repeat the
proofs then delivered my business now lies with
the gentlemen who weie to carry on the Govern-
ment for thirteen mili ons per annum, and who
came into power a few short months ago upon
public pledges to that eff ct Í will see how these
gentlemen are ledeemmg this pledge—will see how
the account stands in the =ecnd quarter of the
existence of their Administration, and m the se-
rond month of the sess on of their first Congress.
For this purpose Í will tak  a view oí tne moneys
and means left by us in their hards o i the fourth of
March last, and oi ihe amount- r?ised or attempted
to be rai cd by themselves at the present session,
and of the amounts waited, «qaandered, or given
a*ay or attempted to be si was'ed, squardcred,
and «iven away I will look int > the r new books
under these th ee head , an i wi 1 ¿se no evidence
against them put that uhich tkey furnish officially
against themselves.
