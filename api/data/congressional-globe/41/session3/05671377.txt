The education of the people as we all know is
the corner stone of a republic. Without, the
diffusion of knowledge among the masses no
republic can long exist. Knowledge and virtue
are indispensable in popular Governments. The
world knows the lesson well. The ignorance
of the masses long ago reduced the miscalled
republics of San Domingo, Mexico, and some
of the South American States to a state of
anarchy almost verging on barbarism. They
are practically republics no longer, but des-
potisms, where one military ruler under the
name of president succeeds another with fear-
ful rapidity. In those countries the amount
of illiteracy is fearful, extending to about
eighty per cent, of the population.
By the Constitution the duty is imposed
upon Congress to guaranty to each State a
republican form of government. It must see
to it that the form of government is repub-
lican, so that the people shall have the oppor-
tunity of enjoying the benefits of self-govern-
ment. But this is not all that the Constitution
means. It intends that the people of the
States shall have and enjoy free institutions
in substance as well as in form.
Despotism may lurk under republican forms
as well as under monarchical forms, and a
Governor of a State might, through the ignor-
ance of the people, induce them to permit him
to use despotic power. To prevent such usurp-
ation Congress must take care that the people
are not allowed to remain in ignorance, nor
to be deprived by designing rulers of the bene-
fits of intellectual light and knowledge. It
must, if necessary, educate them, otherwise it
will be unable to insure them a republican
Government, for such a Government has to
be administered by the people themselves,
which if ignorant they cannot do.
'Again, the avowed objects of the Constitu-
tion, as I have stated heretofore, are "to estab-
lish justice, insure domestic tranquillity, pro-
mote the general welfare, and secure the bless-
ings of liberty" to all. How can all these
objects be effected in a Republic when the
governing powers are so ignorant that they
cannot read fhe constitution under which they
live or draft a bill they propose to enact into
a law, and who may be so unconscious of their
rights through ignorance as to permit them to
be usurped by the first demagogue who flatters
them?
With these principles in view let us look
at the educational condition of our Republic.
By the action of Congress and the people four
million ignorant slaves have been liberated
from bondage and made citizens. Ninety-
eight per cent, of them cannot read or write.
The males of proper age have had the elective
franchise conferred upon them. They are citi-
zens of the United States as well as of the
States respectively in which they reside. They
may be called upon to perform duty in both
capacities. They are entitled to select officers
in both State and national governments. In
some States they are the numerical majority.
The nation has imposed on them new obli-
gations. It can call on them to sit or, its
juries, to exercise offices of trnstandprofit, to
become law-makers, and assist in discharging
all governmental duties.
In imposing such obligations on them does
it not impose on itself the obligation to qualify
them for the work they may have to do ? And
how, in the absence of State education, can
it so qualify them without it extends to them
the opportunity to become enlightened as to
their rights and duties? To require them to
labor in its behalf without giving them the
necessary opportunities of instruction would
be as cruel as were the ancient Egyptian task,-
mafef-s, who required their slaves to make
bricks without the traditional straw. In addi-
tion to this great mass of ignorance and super-
stition which has now become a political
power there is a terrible amount of illiteracy
among the whites, especially in the southern
States, whereby such are rendered unfit for

the proper discharge of their political duties
and are ignorant of their political rights.
Let us take a glance at the statistics as thoy
are presented to us by the census of 1860 in
the tables which I hold in my hand, and we
will find a deplorable want of education among
masses of men whose political power, so far
as their individual votes may go, is equal to
that of the most intelligent and cultivated cit-
izens in the land, and whose ballots blindly
deposited may work out the most disastrous
results to our free institutions.

In 1880 seventy out of every one hundred
children of school age in the free States were
attending school, while in the slave States but
thirty-three out of every one hundred were at
sehool.
Of the adult whites in the above-mentioned
coast States nearly thirteen per cent, cannot
read or write.
These tables also show that of the white
population of sehool age (between five and
twenty years) 5,047,729 were attending school,
while 8,821,972 were not attending school,
and that of the colored population of school
age 32,627 were attending sehool and 1,707,800
not attending; making in all 5,680,356 attend-
ing school, and 5,529,772 growing up in igno-
rance, being one sixth of the whole population
at that time.
With such fearful statistics before us, with
such large masses of ignorant men growing up
to operate upon and influence our political
institutions, or to be used as mere tools to pro-
mote the ends of ambitious and designing men,
and with States paying little or no attention
to the educational wants of the people, either
through indifference, hostility to education,.or
pecuniary inability, what is the duty of Con-
gress in the matter ?
My colleague from Illinois seems to fear any
interference of Congress as "a conquest of
the States." He denounces the education of
the masses as an "invasion of the most sacred
right of the people." With a knowledge that
some of the States are not doing their duty to
the people he demands that they should be
allowed to grow up in ignorance as one of " the
reserved rights of the States and the people."
Mr. McNEELY. I trust the gentleman will
not put a false construction o'n my language.
What he is saying will go to his constituents,
and I do not wish to be misrepresented by any
such statement as that I am in favor of igno-
rance.
Mr. TOWNSEND, I give the language of
the gentleman as I copy it from the official
report. I have made an exact quotation.
Mr. McNEELY. The gentleman knows very
well that I hold no such opinions as he would
attribute to me. My opposition is directed
against interference by the Government of
the United States with educational matters
belonging properly to the jurisdiction of the
States. The gentleman must know he is
attributing to me opinions which I do not hold.
Mr. TO WNSEND. I undertake to say that
what I quote as the language of the gentleman
is to be found in his remarks as printed in the
Globe.
Mr. McNEELY. I undertake to say that
the gentleman is misrepresenting my senti-
ments by quoting garbled extracts from my
speech.
Mr. TOWNSEND. The record shall decide
between us. His party has already in this Houee
sounded its bugle-blast against popular educa-
tion ; it has voted against supplies to the Bureau
of Education, and one of its leaders has given
formal notice that when his party gets into
power it will abolish the bureau. I have no
doubt that it will, and am obliged to him for
the notice in advance. Forewarned we will
be forearmed, and will keep his party out of
power. That party knows that the greater
the ignorance of the masses the greater its
political power, and hence it denounces the
light of education which might permit the
people to see "its ways that are dark and its
tricks that are vain."
My colleague, in his zeal for State rights, for-
gets that the citizens of a State are citizens of
the nation as well; that the notion's claims
upon them are paramount to those of a State,
and that, it can even withdraw them from State
duties to its own service when the public
exigencies demand it. With such extensive
powers over the people, it has also its obli-
gations. "It is in good faith bound to qualify
them for the discharge of any services it may
demand of them, and to see that all the people
of the States have Republican institutions
guarantied to them, and that they are so in-
structed as to enable them to aid in the gen-
