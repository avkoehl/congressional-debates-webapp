The Secretary of War has authorized General Grant to assign officers under their brevet rank when it is desirable to avoid delay.

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have the honor to report all quiet on this front during the past twenty-four hours. Details of 800 men and 100 teams for work on the corduroy road near the new railroad, and 600 men on the new works on the left of the line.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 9, 1865. (Received 10.50 a.m.)

Colonel GEORGE D. RUGGLES,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

Three deserters came in this morning from the Fifty-eighth Virginia Infantry. One of them, Munroe Stone, states that they left the rebel lines at 2 a.m.; is in Corse's brigade, Walker's division, Gordon's corps. Does not think Sheridan has taken Lynchburg yet, as the trains are still running there. One brigade was sent more than a week ago to Roanoke River to prevent desertions. Men are deserting the rebel ranks in large numbers. The Fifty-eighth Virginia has lost fifty men by desertion in the last ten days. Can report no movement of troops except Pickett's division, which moved to Gordonsville last week. Has heard that Early was captured and confirms the report of cotton and tobacco being piled up in Petersburg ready to be burned in case the city is evacuated.

For Major-General Warren:

Respectfully,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Brevet Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
