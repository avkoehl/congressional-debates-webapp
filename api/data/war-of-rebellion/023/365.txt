Colonel J. B. FRY:

The train coming north was fired into this side of Reynolds'; several severely wounded. I have 50 First Kentucky west of Reynolds' scouting, expecting that the band at Cornersville would retreat that way. I have heard nothing from Major Rogers. The Third Kentucky have not returned yet from Nashville. Do you intend the company First Kentucky at Franklin to remain? It is much needed in that vicinity.

Brigadier-General.
