HUNTSVILLE, ALA., August 17, 1862-8.15 a. m.

Major-General HALLECK, General-in-Chief:

Governor Tod says he can send no troops to Kentucky until the middle of next week. That they should be sent without an hour's delay is of vital importance.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, August 17, 1862.

Major-General BUELL, Huntsville, Ala.:

The two divisions at Decatur have been replaced and are in motion to join you. General Grant says you have not answered his telegrams in relation to this movement.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

HUNTSVILLE, ALA., August 17, 1862-6.30 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Commander-in-Chief:

Grant is mistaken, or else his dispatches have not reached me. We pretty nearly understand each other now.

D. C. BUELL,

Major-General.

CORINTH, August 17, 1862.

General BUELL:

I sent troops by way of Decatur by General Halleck's order. As I must endeavor to keep the road open to that point I will ascertain the present position of the advance troops and change their route. If they are not too far advanced, by substituting another division for Paine's, which is in advance, the route may be changed. The command has no wagon train except the regimental teams of thirteen wagons to a regiment.

U. S. GRANT.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 17, 1862.

General GRANT, Corinth:

My dispatches to you have two or three times been delayed over-night because operators beyond Decatur could not be roused.

D. C. BUELL.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, August 17, 1862.

General GRANT, Corinth:

When will the divisions be at the points designated to cross and where will they cross?

D. C. BUELL.
