I shall expect from you written reports by couriers of any movements of the enemy of which you may be cognizant bearing upon our relations. Have your neighborhood well picketed. The citizens themselves, of course, if properly instructed, can give you all necessary information.

I am, captain, respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.

ATLANTA, GA., December 7, 1863.

COMMANDANT OF POST, Marietta, Ga.:

COLONEL: Bearing as Marietta does so important a relation to Atlanta as a covering point, as a precautionary move simply, I beg to request of you that such information of movements of the enemy on our front as regards raids, &amp;c., may be furnished me as rapidly as you may become possessed of it. Having so small a force at this point [although now well fortified, and a good force available if notice be given] on active duty, it behooves me to avail myself of all assistance I can secure from points in front. From Marietta, by your kind assistance, I can get news which I could otherwise only secure from scouts, &c., which will involve the services of cavalry not immediately at hand. At Rosswell, on your right, I have a good force to cover that road.

I am, sir, respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.

ATLANTA, GA., December 7, 1863.

ASST. ADJT. General TO GENERAL IVERSON, Rome, Ga.:

CAPTAIN: Having been charged with the defenses of Atlanta, and in view of the present condition of affairs in the front, a powerful enemy having gained a firm foothold on our very borders, I beg to request that the general commanding the forces which cover the left of our army at Rome will please furnish me by telegraph and mail such information of the movements of the enemy, in the way of raiding parties, as may interest us at this point, having so small a force at our command and of such character as to make our position insecure unless well advised in case a raid should start for this place.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

M. H. WRIGHT,

Colonel, Commanding.

MERIDIAN, December 7, 1863.

His Excellency the PRESIDENT, Richmond:

Major-General Lee was assigned by you to command all cavalry in this department. I understood that order to be modified by Forrest's promotion. Am I right?

J. E. JOHNSTON.
