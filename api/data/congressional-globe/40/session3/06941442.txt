. national junction railway.
Mr. HARLAN. I move that the Senate
take up Senate bill No. 669, to incorporate the
National Junction Railway Company. It is a
bill of the same kind as the one just passed,
and there will be no objection to its passage,
I think. â€¢
Mr. STEWART. If the Senator will give
way for one moment the Senator from Alabama
[Mrr. Warner] now says that he will not press
his motion to concur in the amendment of the
House of Representatives to the constitutional
amendment, and so I hdpe we shall be allowed
to have a committee of conference appointed
upon it at once.
Mr. HARLAN. Let this bill be taken up
first.
Mr. STEWART. Letushave the committee
of conference appointed. It will not take a
moment.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The ques-
tion is on taking up the bill mentioned by the
Senator from Iowa.
Mr. STEWART. I hope the Senator will
withdraw that motion.
Mr. HARLAN. Let it be taken up and I
will not object.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. STEWART. Now I ask that the bill
be laid aside, and that we resume the consider-
ation of the constitutional amendment.
Mr. HARLAN. I am willing that it shall
be laid aside informally.
Mr. DAVIS. I object to that.
Mr. CHANDLER. Then I move to lay it
aside until a vote can be taken on the consti-
tutional amendment.
Mr. STEWART. I will move to lay it on
the tabic temporarily, until we can have a com-
mittee of conference appointed.
Mr. POMEROY. It cannot be laid on the
table temporarily.
Mr. STEWART. Well, let it be laid on the
table.
Mr. HARLAN. This bill can be passed in
five minutes, and it ought to be done. We
ought to give the people of the District the
right to build a road for themselves around tho
District.
Mr. CHANDLER. Let us pass the consti-
tutional amendment.
Mr. HARLAN. We can dispose of this bill
in five minutes, and then we can take up the
other subject.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The bill is
before the Senate.
The Senate, as in Committee of the Whole,
proceeded to consider the bill (S. No. 669) to in-
corporate the National Junction Railway Com-
pany.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the bill.
Mr. STEWART. 1 move to lay the pending
bill on the table and to take up the constitu-
tional amendment. That is evidently a long
bill and there will not be a quorum when the
reading of it is disposed of.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. That can-
not be done. The bill must be read.
Mr. WILLIAMS. Let us pass it by its title.
Mr. STEWART. If it can be passed with-
out reading, very well.
Mr. POMEROY. I hope we shall hear the
bill read through.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The read-
ing will be proceeded with.
The Chief Clerk resumed and concluded (he
reading of the bill.
It proposes to create James A. Magruder,
John L. Kidwell, C. H. Cragan, John W.
Thompson, Hallet Kilbourn, - Alexander R.
Sheppard, and William H. Tenney, of the Dis-
trict of Columbia, together with such other
persons as may become associated with them
lor that purpose, together with their succes-
sors, into a body-corporate and politic, in deed
and in law, by the name and title of the National
Junction Railway Company, and by that name
have perpetual succession, to be able to sue
and to be sued, to plead and be impleaded, to
defend and be defended in the courts of law
and equity within the District of Columbia,
and to use a common seal and adopt by-laws
for the regulation of its government.
The PRESIDENTprotempore. The amend-
ments reported by the Committee on the Dis-
trict of Columbia will be read.
Mr. STEWART. I move that the bill now
be laid on the table for the purpose of taking
up the constitutional amendment.
The motion was not agreed to.
Mr. CAMERON. I move that the Senate
adjourn-. It is getting rather late.
Mr. STEWART. I shall call for the yeas
and nays on that motion.
Mr. CAMERON. That will not make any
difference. It is just as easy to vote on the
yeas and nays as any other way.
Mr. HAHLAN. I hope the bill will be
disposed of.
Mr. STEWART. I should be willing to let
it be passed if other Senators consent.
Mr. CONKLINGr. I do not think it well to
pass it without looking at it.

ments reported by the committee will be read.
