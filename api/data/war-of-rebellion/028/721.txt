I have advised you of the information received form the scouts north of the Rappahannock. I can learn of no movement on any of the roads form Warrenton or Brentsville road Fredericksburg. A scout is now on the road from Fredericksburg to Occoquan. Sickles' corps is reported to be on the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, advanced toward the Rappahannock as far as Bealeton, his own headquarters at Dr. Shumate's. I think Porter's corps is in Virginia, inasmuch as the Washington papers state Hooker's departure for Virginia to relieve Porter, who is to be court-martialed on charges by General Pope. Your demonstration through the gaps of the mountains have probably embarrassed and retarded the enemy's movements, and if you were in condition to push them vigorously I have no doubt you would arrest his advance. We will, however, endeavor to confuse and confound him as much as our circumstances will permit. As one mode of embarrassing him, I should have commenced breaking up the Orange and Alexandria Railroad from the Rappahannock to Gordonville, as well as that form Fredericksburg to Hanover Junction, but for my reluctance to perpetuate what might prove an unnecessary injury to the community. If I could ascertain that he would pursue either of these routes, I should commence at once. I have ordered the destruction of the road form Fredericksburg to Aquia Creek. No depots of forage have been placed on the road between is farther removed form the route, as they would be as likely to benefit him as us.

I am, with great respect, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.
