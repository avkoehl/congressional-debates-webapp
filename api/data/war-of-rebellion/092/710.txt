strength has been series of intercepted dispatches of which I have the honor to annex copies. * It gives the strength of the enemy in charleston and to the northern part of the harbor. I am not of opinion that these dispatches were intended as a ruse to mislead us. the only method by which I can ascertain with any degree of certainty the strength of the enemy will be by attacking his outposts, which I consider myself sufficiently strong to do. Troops left Charleston yesterday, one light battery from Mount Pleasant, and 3 officer and 100 men from Sullivan's Island; further is not known. The flag of truce is still in operation.

I have the honor to be, lieutenant, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

A. SCHIMMELFENNIG,

Brigadier-General, Commanding District.

P. S. -At this moment the Hancox has arrived bringing dead bodies from the flag-of-truce boat. Her captain reports that prisoners-exchanged to-day have informed him that it was reported in Charleston that Savannah surrendered to-day with 10,000 prisoners after a fight of eight hours. Nothing official from Colonel Mulford.

Respectfully,

A. SCHIMMELFENNIG,
