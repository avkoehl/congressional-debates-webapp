From this it appears that this '• hateful
monopoly" had in this country, in 1860, 1.261
mills with 3,209 sets of cards; and in 1870,
2,783 mills, with 8,3G8 cards, and that while
in 1860 his own rich and powerful Northwest
had only 307 of these establishments, with a
power of only 466 card's, there are now there
910 mills with a power of production meas-
ured by 1,752 sets of cards. Thus vanish be-
fore the test of facts all his charges that in this
free land anybody can secure a ''monopoly"
of any kind of productive industry.
The gentleman from Illinois [Mr. Burch-
ahu] is equally mistaken in his bounty theory,
whether he applies it to the pioduceror the
operative. In the first place, if it were true,
does he suppose that there is police force
enough in the country to hold b<tck the rush
of capitalists and workmen who would be
crowding in to share these bounties ? You
cannot strew gold along any pathway without
(hiding the whole human race turning its foot
steps thitherward. Nor do facts, more than
the laws of human action, bear out any state-
ment of extraordinary profits, either to the
producer or the operative. There may be
instances, as there are in every calling in life,
where instinct and energy and frugality, a..d
it may be chance, have been rewarded with
fortune. But the rule covering men by classes
and reaching over long years is, in these pur-
suits as in all others, that the failures far
exceed the successes. And nothing can be
established more clearly from returns and
official data than the fact that for the last
thirty years, including all the inflations and
chance opportunities of the war, capital in
this field has not made six per cent.
I now turn briefly to the charge of the gen-
tleman from Missouri, [Mr. Finkelxbukg,]
that tariffs grind down the wage laborer in pov-
erty and misery, while the producer bloats in
his gains. I do not complain of the temper
of the gentleman in his treatment of this sub-
ject. I only regret that he did not get his in-
formation through his eyes instead of his ears.
Nor will I raise an issue at this time with the
labor jommission of Massachusetts, which
has furnished him his data. I hail every effort
of that commission to elevate the condition
of labor in Massachusetts ; but the instances
they have dragged to light no more prove the
general condition of the operative than the
marching iuto open court of a criminal for
tiial proves the general prevalence of crime
in any community. They prove the contrary,
thai society will not tolerate their longer con-
tinuance.
But, sir, whoever at "home or here represents
the operative as ground down in poverty and
want by his bloated employer is mistaken, and
he has but to open his eyes and he will see.
I have lived all my days among these opera-
tives. Some of my colleagues and others upon
this floor have been of them, and have more
right than I have to speak for them. The
honorable distinction to which these men
have risen from their ranks is the pride and
boast of the operative as he points to his
opportunities and his ambition in the battle
ol life. I would not like to go home among
these men if I failed to vindicate them from
the foul aspersions which misinformation casts
upon them. There is no class of men on the
face of the globe, who, as a class, are more
frugal, more moral, more intelligent, or make
better citizens. As a class they take care of
theirearnings, secure homes of theirown, make
monthly deposits in the savings banks, build
school-houses and churches, and, better than
:-ll, build character and influence for them-
selves, to which the common judgment of the
community accords respect and points with
pride. We have in Massachusetts savings banks
established ,o gather in and invest their earn-
ings for -them. No one person can deposit
more than $1,000 in any one of them. There
are one hundred and sixty of them in the
Commonwealth, and there are deposited in
them to-day $163,535,943 by 560,890 different
depositors out of 1,443,156 inhabitants in the
whole State, one in every three. Recent in-
vestigations demonstrate that more than sev-
enty-five per cent, of all this sum is the savings
of wage labor. I need say no more in vindi-
cation of the Massachusetts operative.
Kqually erroneous was the inference of the
gentleman from the table of dividends of
certain selected corporations furnished him
from the same source. I have a copy of a
letter addressed to the gentleman from Mis-
souri by one of the most reliable men in my
State, Mr. E. S. Fay, himself an officer in
many of these very corporations, which wholly
dissipates all his conclusions. I have his per-
mission to annex his letter to my remarks,*
But I have said all that space will justify upon
the inordinate gains of the producer.
I ask a moment's further indulgence wMle I
state my objections to particular features of
this bill, and the amendments I hope the House
will adopt and make it what the country de-
mands, a safe repeal of duties and taxes. It
is not to the amountof reduction that I object,
for I would make it more by $15,000,000, but
* Washington, March 28,1872.
Sir: In a speech in the House on the 23d, you
quoted the profits of certain woolen and cotton-mills
in Massachusetts as arguments in favor of a reduc-
tion of tariff. Feeling sure that you desire to make
up your mind upon a correct understanding of facts,
I venture to address you in explanation of some of
the figures you quote. I will confine myself to two
or three instances where I am in a position to speak
from authority. The Middlesex mills, of which I am
treasurer, were started in 1815 by Mr. Groulding,
who lost his entire invesrment in about five years.
The property was then bought by Mr. Hard, who
became bankrupt in 1828. Mr. Hard's assignees, by
way ot disposing of their property, made up a corpor-
ation called the Middlesex Company, with a capital
of half a million, which was afterward increased
to a million. The business was fairly remunerative
until the tariff of 1846 came into operation, but
after that the profits were small and uncertain,
until in 1857 the company failed. In 1858 the cor-
poration was reorganized, and $309,000 of new
capital was paid in, but the value of the property
had so diminished that even with this increase "of
capital the stocK was considered worth only $750,Q00t
and was so established. You will sec, therefore,"
that the average dividends of twenty-two ana
a half per cent., cited by you as earned upon
a capital of $750,000, gave but half that return
upon the amount invested since the beginning,
and that in a decade in which were included
the extraordinary profits of the war with its
groat rise in prices and inflation. The profits of the
last four years have been thirteen per cent, per
annum on the capital of $750,000, or only about
eight per cent, to an original holder ot the stock.
On the other hand, our pay-roll in 1858-59, 1860-61,
was about eighteen thousand dollars per month.
At present it is $26,000 for the same number of
hands. The average wages ot able-bodied men
were then ninety-five cents a day; they are now
SI 37. Are we getting all the profit? Is not the inter-
est of the laborer identical with that ot the manu-
facturer; and is it true kindness to the former to
excite a feeling of antagonism? Owing chiefly to
the enormous advance m the price of wool we are
this season running at a loss, and would gladly close
our mills were it not for our unwillingness to throw
a thousand hands out of employment.
Another of the mills cited by you is the Chicopee
Company, of which I am <t dnector. The Chicopee
Company was chartered with a capital of $700 000.
Under the tariff of 1846 its profits dwindled tQ noth-
ing; in 1857 it failed, and was sold to a new set of
stockholders for $220,000. ^wo hundred thousand
dollars new money was put m, and during the war
they made a great deal of tnon ey on heavy shirtings
and cotton flannels used for Army clothing. With
these profits they increased their machinery, and
are now prosperous and in good order. But their
average dividends quoted by you as twenty-six per
cent, on &420.000, should be stated as twelve per
cent, on 890u,000 to give a correct idea of their busi-
ness.
The Salisbury mills failed in 1856, (before the cri-
sis.) sinking their whole capital of $1,000,000, and
SI,000,000 of new money was put m to set them going
again. So their average dividend for the last ten
years must be divided by two and reduced from
twenty-two per cent, to eleven per cent, to represent
their business. For three years past they have not
divided quite eight per cent, on their investment.
I am not a believer in high protective duties, but
while our raw material, wool, the iron and steel that
make our machinery, the coal we burn for heat and
power, our dyes and drugs, and every material and
element that enter into the expense of manufac-
ture, are charged with duties, it is surely but fair that
woolen goods should be equally protected. More-
over, were I a free-trader I should be sorry to carry
my point by arguments drawn from fallacious data,
and so I am sure would you.
I um, respectfully, yours, r. s. VAY.
I reopen my letter to add a word upon the price
at which some of the stocks referred to have sold,
ltis true the Middlesex company's shares, represent-
ing $1 <5 paid in, sold atone time for nearly four hun-
dred dollars. and the Salisbury shares, on which $200
had been paid in sold for$360; but this was atatime
when gold was at 200 and upward, so that the pre-
mium was not excessive in one case, and the Salis-
bury stock was at adiscount. At present thpsestooks
are worth : Middlesex company, $175 per share paid
m; market value, $160; Salisbury mills, $200 paid in;
market value, §155.
I believe I know of but one woolen mill in New
-England whose stock stands at a premium on the
amount paid in upou it. That mill was built in 1861,
and reserved its war profits to double its machinery*
making only very moderate dividends.
