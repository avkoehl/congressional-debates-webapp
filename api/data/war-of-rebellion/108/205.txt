General S. COOPER,

Adjutant-General.

Your dispatch received. I leave for Staunton to-day. By my proper command I suppose you mean the first three regiments now at Staunton. Am I right? There are two regiments at Lynchburg and three here and one more expected here from West Tennessee. General Zollicoffer is here. You had better give instructions to the troops at Lynchburg and at this place.

S. R. ANDERSON,

Brigadier-General.

CHARLESTOWN, VA., July 31, 1861.

General JOHNSTON,

Near Manassas:

SIR: I would respectfully report to you that about 10,000 of General Banks' command are encamped near Knoxville, 2,000 above Harper's Ferry, on the Maryland side, 1,000 in Harper's Ferry, with two companies of cavalry on this side. Sixty came to Charlestown lat night. I send a prisoner, whom I took near the Ferry last night, who may give you informatin. The army of Banks is very much disorganized, and I think never will return to the soil of Virginia.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN HENDERSON,

Captain of Virginia Rangers.

Two companies of cavalry have just come to Charlestown.
