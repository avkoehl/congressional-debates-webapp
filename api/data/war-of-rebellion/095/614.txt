Under the operation of general orders those remaining in U. S. general hospitals whose physical condition will permit will be discharged from the service as soon as such action can be correctly and properly effected. The number [17,816] in U. S. general hospitals December 31, 1864, being approximative, the 22,458 yet to be accounted for is an approximate estimate also. Comparison of the numbers received in the Depot Field Hospital, Army of the Potomac, City Point, since January, 1865, 26,244, with the number reported as sent to general hospital from the field, 17,673, shows a difference of 8,571. This is attributable to the fact that the Depot Hospital, Army of the Potomac, at City Point, admitted the wounded and sick of the other co-operative armies, from which I received no report. The number is large also because many men, unable to accompany their commands upon the return march to the Potomac, who under other circumstances would not have been detached from their regiments, were sent to City Point to be transported by water. The number sent North from City Point was 15,606. The difference between number reported sent to general hospital and number received at City Point, in the several months, were-for January, 94; February, 903; March, 1,365; April 5,611; May, 928-which indicate the principal discrepancies as occurring during the period of most active operations and from the cause above stated.

In this connection it will be observed that the number of gunshot wounds in the Army of the Potomac from January to June 30, 1865, according to the monthly reports received, was 6,833, whereas the number of gunshot wounds actually admitted at City Point was 9,137. The number of wounds and injuries [Class V] reported admitted in the
