NEW YORK, April 21, 1863.

Brigadier General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Fifth Corps, Army of the Potomac, Falmouth, Va.:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 13th instant is received. It will afford me pleasure to make the corrections your letter suggests in the full and final report I am now preparing. My impression has been that your command was not in condition to be thrown into action until near the close of the 18th, if then; but I never attributed any blame to you or your troops for it, regarding it as the necessary result of circumstances beyond your control. I do not now see that any censure upon yourself could be implied from the paragraph you quote. None was intended.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army.
