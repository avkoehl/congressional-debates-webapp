PROVOST-MARSHAL'S OFFICE,

Liberty, August 23, 1864.

Colonel A. C. JONES,

Insp. General Dist. of Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona:

COLONEL: I respectfully address you a few lines concerning the situation of Liberty since the disbandment of Captain G. Lacour's company. The remaining parties of jayhawkers are on the line in the woods of Liberty and Hardin Counties, threatening to burn the town, and killing every one who had anything to do with the arrest and killing of their consorts in June and July last. Since they have heard of the disbanded of Captain Lacour's company they come clear in town. Captain Lacour had to leave his home with family and negroes and come to town for protection, and there is not much. We have no men to do patrol duty except a few over fifty years old. We have no reserve corps; they were all taken from Lacour's company and conscripted. Colonel, should it be in your power to assist us to cleat the woods, the remaining citizens are ready to go after them.

Awaiting respectfully your orders, I remain, colonel, your obedient servant,

WM. MEYER,

Provost-Marshal.
