Respectfully forwarded.

It perhaps would be well if I could visit Fort Rice before starting on my expedition. I might be able to do this, if as I suggested a light steamer should be chartered to carry stores. As regards the cavalry force to be stationed at Rice, I have no cavalry for that service, but I would suggest the propriety of purchasing ponies to mount the infantry as a more convenient mode of keeping a cavalry force in the country.
