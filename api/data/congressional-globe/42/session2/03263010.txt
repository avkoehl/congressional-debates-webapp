country, the payment of the public debt, and
against American independence. Protection
is enabling us to pay our national debt at a
rate satisfactory to the people and creditable
to the Government, and under tlie healthy
influence of existing laws the material re-
sources of national wealth are being devel-
oped at a rate and to an extent hitherto
unknown. Laborers, manufacturers, and pro-
ducers everywhere are asking to be let alone,
while importers, traders, and gentlemen ol
leisure, who are mere consumers, who pro-
duce nothing, and add nothing to aggre-
gated wealth, but are mere traffickers in the
products of other men's labor, are clamoring
for low duties that they may continue to fatten
and grow rich at the expense and degradation
of honest toil.
The strength and glory of a nation, as well
as the intelligence and prosperity of its people,
depends very largely upon the diversification
of its productions. While we have the natural
capacity for agricultural productions in quan-
tity and variety to an unlimited extent, our
manufacturing resources are equally unlim-
ited. These two industries have been very
properly termed twin sisters; an injury to one
is equally an injury to the other, and from
their joint productions the trade and com-
merce of the world is carried on.
protection to farmers.
Free-trade economists are unceasing in their
declarations of sympathy for the farmer, de-
claring that he is oppressed and robbed by
tariff laws for the benefit of manufacturing
monopolists ; that he is taxed on his iron and
steel, his hardware and cutlery, his cotton and
woolen goods, and 011 everything that iie uses,
forgetting to tell him that as an offset lie is
protected on everything he produces, and that
all this protection inures to the benefit of the
labor of the country and to the United Stales
Treasury. There is not a single production
of the field, the orchard, or the dairy that does
not share this protection, inpioof ofwhich I an-
nex thefollowingtablecouipiledfrom thereport

Thus we hcive the fact established by figures
from an undoubted source that the leading
agricultural productions represented in the fore •
going table, amounting to nearly one hundred
and thirty-three million dollars, are protected
by an aggregate duty of nearly fifty-one mil-
lion dollars, or an average duty of about
thirty-eight per cent., in which the great grain-
growing, stock, and wool-producing States of
the West and Northwest fully participate; and
yet. the del^ga/ion* from those States, with
few exceptions, are opposed to protection.
Wipe out or even reduce the tariff on grain,
siock, and wool, and no class would suffer
more than western farmers. Canada, with
her cheap labor and unbounded pasturage,
could drive them from the markets.
The States of Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, Michi-
gan, Wise >nsin, and Minnesota, produced in
1870 one hundred and twenty miilioa' bushels
of wheat, or over one half the entire crop of
the United Stales, on which they enjoyed the
benefit of a duty of twenty cents per bushel,
amounting to $24,000,000 protection, and yet
they received per bushel but little over one
half the price received by the New England
States. The same is Uue as to piice of other
ct-ieali,; and the icaoon is obviously because
in the West probably nine tenths of the labor
is employed m agriculture, while in New Eng-
land it is divided between agriculture and
manufactures. Our importations the last fis-
cal year exceeded $518,000,000, on which we
collected duties amounting to largely over
$200,000,000. Now there can be no doubt
but that a critical examination would show
that from thirly to thirty-i.hree per cent, at
least of these importations was made up of
articles strictly agricultural from which full
average duties were collected. And, so far
from being rubbed, as has been alleged, the
farmer fully and equally participates with other
producers in the benefits of protection.
Lei the Wtsr. diversify her productions by a
more judicious division of labor; let furnaces,
forges, cotton and woolen mills, and other
mamii.tctui mg establishments be spread over
the Minsifsippi valley as they are over the
New England States, and the difference in the
value of farm productions in the two locilities
will boon disappear. Every laborer trans-
ferred from the field to the factory, together
with each member of his family, still remain
the animal consumers of an equal number of
barrels of flour, with pork, beef, and other agri-
cultural productions in proportion, thus re-
lieving the farmer of a competitor, giving him
a new customer, and saving the cost of sending
just so much to a distant market.
I?ree-trade economists, with untiring zeal,
argue that any rate or percent, of duty charged
upon imported articles adds precisely" the same
rate or per cent, to the value of all similar
domestic^ productions, and they usually take
pig iron for a basis, and argue thus: if the duty
on pig iron he seven dollars per ton, then it
follows that every ton manufactured in the
United States is just seven dollars higher to
the consumer than it would be without the duty ;
and the same argument is used m regard to
every other description of iron, as well as
leather, cotton, and woolen goods, and all the
minor productions of American manufactures.
It seems entirely pertinent as well as inter-
esting to the producing classes to inquire
whether without protection we could at the
present prices of labor ever manufacture a
single ton of iron, a side ot leather, or a yard
of cotton or woolen cloth, or anything else, and
whether a failure on our part to manufacture
would not place us at the mercy of foreign
manufacturers, and compel us to pay prices
far higher than they now are; whether our
condition as a dependent nation would not be
pitiable in time of peace and helpless ill time
of war; and whether, if we should still strive to
pay our national debt, the whole burden and
weight would not fall upon agriculture?
No nation in the world, however rich and
productive in soil and genial in climate, which
lias failed to diversify her labor and combine
manufactures with her agriculture, has ever
reached the rank of even second class among
the nations of the earth ; and notwithstanding
all that nature has done for this country, if
1 n 8'la^ eVer come when the Government
shall tail to protect and defend alike the farmer,
manufacturer, and laborer, through whose in-
dustry and energy alone the resources of this
grand country can be developed, then and
from that day will the current of poverty, deg-
radation, and dependence set in, and a new
system of slavery be inaugurated by which the
labor of our hands and the products of our soil
wdl contribute to the wealtu of the nations of
Europe instead of our own.
ax absurdity.
If it be true, as alleged by free-trade disci-
ples, that the duty on imported articles of man-
ufacture adds just so much to the price of sim-
ilar articles ol domestic manufacture, which,
as they say, goes into the pockets of manufac-
turing monopolies, then it must be equally true
that the duty on imported articles of agricul-
tine adds just so much to the price of similar
articles ot domestic production, which must,
according to their own showing, go into the
pockets of agiicultural monopolies; in which
case, it strikes me, the farmers will have the
best of it, and I as a farmer certainly have a
right to examine and leport upon this question.
We produced last year 111 round numbers two
hundred and forty million bushels of wheat,
protected by a duty of twenty cents per bushel,
making $48,000,000; also eleven hundred
million bushels of corn, protected by a duty of
ten cents per bushel, making 5110,000,000;
also two hundred and fifty million bushels of
oats, protected by aduty of ten cents per bushel,
making §2-5,000,000. Thus we have on these
three articles alone an aggregate duty of
$183,000,000, which, according to the showing
of free-traders, is a tax upon the consumeri
of SI 75 per capita for the benefit of farmers.
Now, if we add rye, barley, buckwheat, pota-
toes, butter, cheese, beet, pork, bacon, live
animals, wool, and all other agricultural pro-
ductions which are protected, and then ascer-
tain the aggregate duties thereon, we shall
have an immense sum amounting to hundreds
ot millions, and proving conclusively that the
farmer has quite as much protection as th.:
manufacturer.
Experience has fully demonstrated the fact
that ihe only way to cheapen the productions
of either the farm or the factory is to protect
and stimulate both, by which our own produ-
cer will compete not only, with each other,
but also with Europe, for the American mar-
ket. It has become a common expression
that the industnes of the country are always
in danger when Congress is in session, and
it is to be regretted that our unsettled and
vacillating course affords ground for the re-
mark. Gentlemen are always to be found m
this House v,'ho, if not clamoring for free trade,
are advocating such reductions of duties as tend
to cripple and paraljze the industrial enterprise
of the country.
A tariff that will do justice to all classes
and all interests by distiibuting the burdens
of taxation equally, and yet discriminating in
favor of American productions, is in my judg-
ment what is desired by the people; and the
question arises, have we such a tariff now >
My answer is in the affirmative and emphatic,
in proof ot which I need only refer to the
unparalleled prosperity of the country during
the last decade; and especially since the close
ot the. war; agricultural productions have
steadily increased, while mining and manufac-
turing operations have in many instances moie
than doubled, and our progress in ihe arts
and sciences, and in the development, of the
material resources ot the country duntig the
last five jears, are without a parallel in Ihe
history of the world, ail of which must it: fan-
ness be attributed very largely to the benefi-
cent workings of the tariff, and regarded as
the healthy results ot protection to home
industry.
