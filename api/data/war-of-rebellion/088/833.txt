It will be remembered, however, that the rebels have always drawn large quantities of supplies every fall from the counties embraced in the northern neck of Virginia. Welford's Furnace, in Spotsylvania County, has been rebuilt, and is again in full blast. I have men this morning from over the river who met an agent last night returned from Richmond. There is no change in the information, and no movements of troops to be reported. Nothing is known in Richmond outside of official circles of the position of Early. A neighbor of our agent, who resides in Charles City County, came on Tuesday from Petersburg. He reports that while there several of the heaviest guns were being moved from their positions. No facts were obtainable showing whether it was a mere change in position, or whether they were to be sent elsewhere. I desire to add, as a matter of personal explanation, that the scouts who go from the neighborhood of Orange Court-House and Fredericksburg to Washington, report, by order, to General Grant's assistant adjutant-general at Washington, and their reports are thence forwarded to General Grant direct. I have in a few cases received copies of them, and have then always forwarded them to General Humphreys without delay. The men are mainly the citizens who used to be in our employ in that direction.

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Two prisoners of war have just been forwarded from the Second Corps. They belong to the Washington Artillery, and are attached to Mahone's division. They came out to look for stray horses and strolled into our pickets. They are both intelligent men, and do not seem anxious to return, though their mind is not fully made up on the point. They say that no movements have taken place of late, and the position of their army remains unchanged. Their battery is posted
