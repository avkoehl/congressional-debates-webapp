INCREASE OF THE ARMY.
SPEECH OF MR. KBMBLE,
Of New York,
In the House  of Representatives, Tuesday, June 20,
1838—On the bill from ihe Senate " to increase
the military establishment of the United Slates.
Mr. KEMBLE rose, and said:  After the able
expose which we have received from the chairman
of the Military Commiitee, of the pist and pre-
sent state of the Army, it miy appear temerity in
one unaccustoined altogether to public speaking,
for the first time to rise in this House, but the po-
sition which I hold on that comnvtiee, and my dis-
sent on some points Irom the  majority, render it
necessary that I should offer an explanation of my
own course.
At the reduction of the army in 1821, the fron-
tiers of the United States were estimated at about
six thousand  three hundred miles.   The Indian
tribes were subdued and humbled, surrounded by
white population, and convinced, by the lailura of
repeated efforts, that all attempt at resistance must
prove unavailing.    Since that time, the frontiers of
the United States have been  extended to not  less
than eight thousand five hundred  miles, and  the
Mississippi is no longer an  impagable  barrier to
the Western red man; and the Government, wuh
motives of humanity, if not of p dicj, has added,
and is adding to the Indian force on the Western
frontier, by the ti asportation of the tribes within
the State , until the whole force, as estimated by
the Indian Department, will be no   I s« <h -i stxt}-
six thousand fighting men     To .     ¿ th    u rre in
check,  the Secretary estimates an army o1 five
thousand men, stationed m two lines of f rtihca-
tions, one of Six posts penetrating into the Indian
comtry, and eight p >sts within the States of Ar-
kansas and Missoun, which, with a reserve of two
thousand men at Jefferson barracks, and a miiitia
folee organized and to be called out by the Gover-
nors of the States, he consider,   to be sufficient to
maintain the peace of the frontier.    For the north-
western frontiei, General Scott estimates one regi-
ment of ten  companies  of eighty muskets, nine
hundred mem and for the seaboard and Eastern
fjontier, sixty cimpames, or  five thousand four
hundred  men     This distribution  will  leave the
who e   Nor hern   and   Northeastern   or    Cana-
dian  frontiers  without  the  protection  of   a  sir-
gle man , end it will  be  seen that,   wilhout  pro-
tec'ion to the Canadian frontiei, the Western  fron-
t er requites seven thousand, and  the Eastern mi
1 tary   division   of   the   country   six    thousind
three hundred men, making, together, thirteen thou-
sand three hundred men, while the bill reported by
the committee authorizes only eleven thousand six
hundrpd     Thus it would appear that under no dis-
trbution  whatever of this military force, can the
country be efficiently protected     But how is this
deficiency to be met''    Bvmilttia'    Or, in the West
and S >uth, by mounted  volunteers?   The expense
of this last force is estimate 1  by the Secretary of
War to bo; four uri'S the co«t of infantry, and by
the Paymaster General at six umes the cost of in-
famo, exclusive of the enormous waste of in 1 taiy
stoies and  munitions of war inseparable from the
employment of irregular troops, «h ch the Pay ma -
terGeieral estimates again as six for one     But,
taking the v, hi le at ten for one, and sttppos ng, as
is universally practised, that twice as many mditia
and volunteers are called as would be required of
regular troops, it would gneus   he stalling fau
lh it, in the employment  of mounted  volunteers,
who are armed and  used as infantry,  . ndcanbe
compaied on'y with them, their cost to the countrj
is not Jess than  twenty for one of regular troops,
and to this, and thi  alone, is to be  attributed the
enormous cos. oí  fie Fiondiwar     And, sir, that
the whole subject of our  defences  may  be before
you, although somewhit long, I   would beg leave
to read arcpoit from the Secretaiy ol War, made
some time since to the Senate of the United S ates
Department o   Waí March ó, rs3S

jact a tabular statt mentfurni<=hedby the Chief of theOidnance
oihee, and a punted copy of the report, on the same subject,
made some ti ne since by Ihe Department, in answer to a call
of the Senate
From these documents it appears that the defences on the
Atlantic seaboard anil Gulf of Mi xico are altogether inefficient,
the works being unfinished, unauned, and without garrisons,
not even men enough to preserve them from dilapidation, or to
protect them from plundei, and that every naval station and
principal seapoit on the whole mantime frontier of the United
States is exposed to be attacked and destroyed by a very mfe
nor f rce
The defences on our Eastern and Northern frontiers require
íep tn and enlargement, provided the army be so increased as
tirfll iw sufficient garrisons to bs placed m them Tms measure
is necessary, to enable the Government to maintan peaceable

Stci elary of War
Unfortunately, the efforts to carry on these necessary woiks
hare been relaxed Whether lulled into security by a long
peace, or influenced by othei. causes, the nation has ceased to
teel respecting them that interest 'hen importance ought to
inspire Appropriations have been denied altogether, or made
with a sparing hand, the fortifications have been left in an un-
finished state,exposed to the action ol the elements, requiring
costly and extensive repairs before they weie half finished, and,
altera period of more than twenty years, an ! the expenditure
of many millions of dollars, there is not a fortress on out long
line of sea defences capable of lesistiugan armed brig, uotone
that may not be taken by a smalt force, and some of them, from
their quasi insular position, if captuied, may be occupied per
manently during the continuance of a war, or only to be re-
taken at the cost of much blood and treasure
The chief cause of this neglect in one of oui most impor
tant interests, is the opinion, which has so geneially prevailed,
that our navy is the first and best Jottification, and that all the
resources ana energies of the country ought to be directed to
the improvement ol that arm of rhe service. No one has a
higher opinion of the navy of oui country than I hare, but I
believe that, even when carried to the fullest extent to which
it can reach for many years to h me, it will, alone, prove en-
tirely inadequate to defend the extensive mantime ftontier of
the United States
The Board of Navy Commissioners, m a late report, sta e
that, "havmgdue regard to the numbei of seamen cmployedm
our foreign and oasting trade, and in the fiehenes, the force to
be prepared íeady foi use when circumstances may require it,
ought to consist of fifteen ships of the line, twenty five in
gates, twenty five sloops of war, twenty five steamers, and
twenty five smaller vessels, and that the frames and other
timber, the copper, ordnance, tanks, and chain cables, should
also be prepared for ten ships of the line and ten frigates '
These will probably be required to supply losseB from decay
and casualties
The French navy now consists of forty ships of the line, fifty
frigates, and two hundred and twenty smaller vessels That of
Great Britain, ofone hundred and thirty ships of the lino, ore
hundred and twenty frigates, seventy-five sloops of war, forty
five steamers, and ninety eight smaller vessels of war Of
these, there are in commissio  twenty six. ships of the line,
eighteen frigates, fiity-three sloops, and fifty smaller vessels of
war, and six steamers And yet the coasts of both these nations
are lined with fortifications, and possess a complete system of
permanent deleices along their mantime fiontiers Without
such a system, the navy \\ ill have no place ot refuge when
driven into harbor by stress of weathei oi a superior foice,
and, instead of protecting our own commerce, and harassing
thatof the enen y, will be confined altogethei to defensive ppe-
latious, alwavb di&tiesswg and expensive and too often huniill
atmg The extent to whu h oui navy can be carried ought, in
my opiniuu, to be fixed, tin it is erroneous to suppose that it
has no other limit than what a due regaid foi the levenue of
the country impose* to build more ships than we have seamen
to man them, would be to i cur a useless expense, and the
force proposed by the commissioners ought not, for many years
to come, to be exceeded Anxious as I am to  ee the defences
of the country ebtablished upon a peím inent basis, and equally
desnousto see every arm ol the seivice rendered as perfeitand
useful as possible, I may be pardoned foi travelln g out of my
own department, and urgms the usefulness of fixing this or
some other determined limit to our naval forces T his prmci
pie «nee established, the number and size of the naval esta-
blishments, store bouses, magazines, and preparations of every
kind, would be nrdeied in conformity tp it The number of
(fficers would likewise be limited to a due proportion, and the
young and the ardent and enterprising officer might aspllo to
command The best inteiests of the country requiie that this
system should be adopted, and the preparations be made to
cany the navy to this limit as promptly as possible, but this
measure will not enable ua to dispens with permanent fortifi-
cations Without them, the commencement ol a wai will ai
ways 1 e disastrous Our laws do not allow the use ol the sum
maiy means resorted to by other maritime powers to man their
Heels Our ships of war ai e to be manned by volunteer sea-
men, and the coast might be laid waste, and impoifant ponts
occupied, befoie our naval foice could be put in motion In
deed, without fortifications, and stiong one  too, ihipe of war
are exposed to be captuied ol destroyed befoie they can be fit
ted for sea At Copenhagen, the whole Danish Meet was rjp.
tured, the batteries silenced, and humiliating terms imposed
upon a nation, by the sudden attack ol an overwhelming
force
With respect to the magm'ude of (lie works, to which ob
jectionshave been mged, they will be v or e than useless if
they be not of a description to stop an enemy's squadron, and,
if assailable by land, and m a position not promptly to be sue
coied, strong enough to re&ist a coup de mum—not euch an as
sault as the common acceptation of the term implies, but to of
fer an effectual íesistance for rive oi six days aeamst an attack
in  force ol ten thousand men, fui ished with all the means
and appliances to conduct a bie0e   Isorto piovule against such
