Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Smith asks of me two batteries of rifled guns and two 30-pounder Parrotts or 4 1/2-inch guns, with ammunition. I have sent him a battery of rifled 10-pounders. Three of my 30-pounders are with Meade, out of six, which are all I have. Smith has four 20-pounders out of nine already. As Meade's siege train has got up will you direct that he turn over to Smith the three 30-pounders and ammunition.

HEADQUARTERS,Near Point of Rocks, Va., June 22, 1864.

Brigadier General RUFUS INGALLS,

Chief Quartermaster, Armies operating against Richmond:

The mail between these headquarters and Fortress Monroe fails of connection. I understand that some gentleman who claims to be postmaster of the Army of the Potomac claims to take it under his charge. May I ask that you will allow the mail of these headquarters to be left at Fortress Monroe in the separate mail bags we furnish, and taken from there as heretofore.

Respectfully,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.
