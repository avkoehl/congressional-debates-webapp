BALTIMORE, November 16, 1861.

Honorable W. H. SEWARD:

I send a special train to Washington with very gratifying and important dispatches from the West Indies.

JOHN A. DIX.

CAMDEN STATION, November 16, 1861.

Honorable GIDEON WELLES:

We sent an extra train at 8. 30 (?) due Washington about 12 noon with Captain Taylor,* of the San Jacinto, who captured Messrs. Mason and Slidell and attendants near the West Indies.

W. P. SMITH.

BALTIMORE, November 16, 1861.

THOMAS A. SCOTT, Assistant Secretary of War:

The boat was late this morning. Slidell and Mason are taken prisoners and are now at Fort Monroe. No news of the fleet this morning.

M. N. FALLS.

NEW YORK, November 16, 1861.

Honorable THOMAS A. SCOTT, Assistant Secretary of War:

I find Associated Press have sent news of capture of Slidell and Mason to catch steamer off Cape Race to-day. Is it well to let the news go without any particulars? It will leave here in City of New York to-day but we may reach her off Cape Race with such particulars as you choose to send. If you say so I will try to overtake the first dispatch and stop it.

E. S. SANFORD.

NEW YORK, November 16, 1861.

T. A. SCOTT:

All right. Message received+ and have sent word along the line to make great exertion to get on board at Cape Race. The excitement here is great. All hands seem rejoiced. The stock brokers are working for a fall on the strength of difficulty with England. The people are glad to see John Bull taken by the horns. It is suggested as a punishment to stop Mason's oysters and Slidell's whisky.

S[ANFORD].

NEW YORK, November 16, 1861.

Honorable T. A. SCOTT:

Finding the line down in Nova Scotia we have sent to Farther Point on the Saint Lawrence to be put on board the Jura which will pass there to-night. If you have any particulars you wish to add and will send them by 6 o'clock they will be in time to reach the Jura.

E. S. SANFORD.
