Rosecrans to push to the assistance of General Thomas, and to march to the point where he can be of the most assistance. Carry this order out, and either send or return to us General Thomas' orders or any news you may have from him. General McCook will certainly be at the head of McLemore's Cove by evening, or will be found on the road leading from that cove to Alpine. Send word back to us or to the head of the column about the condition of the road, water, prospect of forage, &amp;c., or any information of interest to General McCook. You will move immediately. General McCook wishes to use the two companies on the mountain, and you will not take them with you. General Stanley's cavalry is all in the Broomtown Valley, on the way to La Fayette.

Very respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
