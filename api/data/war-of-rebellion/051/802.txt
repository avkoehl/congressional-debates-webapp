of 2 wounded, 1 horse, 1 gun, and 1 revolver captured. We found at Carthage a large quantity of commissary stores, in good condition. I respectfully suggest that the garrison may be safely left at that point for a short time, and that the stores ought, if possible, to be removed.

Of the 2 prisoners captured near Hartsville, one proved to be Lieutenant Petticord, and the other George Stocker, a paroled soldier; the latter having set fire to the bridge at Madden's Mill.

The time occupied in making trip was four days.

All of which is respectfully submitted.*
