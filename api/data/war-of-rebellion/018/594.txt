Washington, August 18, 1862.

General BURNSIDE or PARKE, Falmouth, Va:

Send Captain Biggs to Aquia Creek to hurry the landing and send back the transports. If too much crowded, or there be any probability of your being obliged to fall back, send transports to Alexandria. If possible keep brigades together. Every hour is important, and great care must be taken to hurry forward the transfer of troops.

General-in-Chief.

Major-General DIX, Fort Monroe, Va.:

It is now pretty well ascertained that the enemy is moving in large force against General Pope. Every possible effort should be made to push forward re-enforcements. Not a moment should be lost. Employ everything that can be procured for transports. Send copy to General McClellan.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Porter's command is at Newport News and Hampton. The whole Army of the Potomac is probably at this moment on this side of the Chickahominy. Our telegraph wire to Yorktown is down, or I could give you later news. I hope to be able to leave on Wednesday at furthest.
