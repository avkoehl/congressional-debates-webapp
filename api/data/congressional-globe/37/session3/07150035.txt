The decrease of the expenditures of 1S62, com-
pared with those of 3861, during the greater pa.it
of which mail service was unint 'i 1 upt< d. is
$2,481,394 98, which is more than sixty times*
greater than the deciease ofievenue.
in view of the increased pioteeds of the prin-
cipal post offices during the quarter ending Sep-
tember 30, 1862, it is believed that the gros.s rev-
enue for the year ending June 30, 1863, will equal
the amount of the estimate therefor submitted in
the last annual report fiom this Department, and
that no appropriation additional to those already
made will be needed for tin'fiscal year in ques-
tion.
. The expenditures of all kinds for the fiscal year
ending June 30,1864, aieesli mated at $12,000,000.
Th i s estimate, how ever, does not include the sum
of $1,000,000 fo: the service of the California cen-
tral 1 oute, inasmuch as a special appropi nition
from ' he Ti eusuiy for such set v ice doi ing the cm -
rent fiscal year way niad-' bv the third section of
the act approved April 17,1862, and i<" is presumed
that a similar appropriation will be made for the
transportation of the mails on this route during
the fiscal year ending June 30, 1864.
Table iNo. 1? exhibits in detail the estimated
expenditui es for 1864, under the v u ious heads of
approp nations.
The gross levenue for the year 1864, including
foreign postages, fe; s paid 111 by ietu r can iers,
arid miscellaneous receipts. is estimated at nn in-
crease of five per cent, on the revenues of 1862—
making ^8,714,000.

The estimates of the expenditures for the fiscal
year ending June 30. 3864, are based mainly on
the actual expendituies of the year 1862. A par-
tial piovision, however, is made for the cost of
restoring the postal sei vice in sections of the '-ouu-
ti y v/heie it is now suspendf d, but, notwithstand-
ing this additional source of expenditure, the esti-
mated deficiency for lb6-l is £,3,000,000 less than
the actual deficiency of I860
In estimating the receipts for 1864, it is assumed
that they wtJl exhibit an increase of five per cent,
our the revenues of 1862, although the latter
were a fraction of one per cent, less than those of
1861, during the greater portion of which year
mail service was uninterrupted throughout the
country.
The whole number of post offices in operation
during the year was 19,973, and the number of
quarterly returns received therefrom was 77,109.
The whole number of d rafts and warrants issued
during the year, in paymentof balances reported
by the Auditor to be due mail contractors mid
other creditors of this Department, was 20,284.
The warrants were drawn on the Treasurer of
the United States, five Assistant Treasurers,and
seven designated depositaries, and the drafts on
twenty-seven post office depositaries and post-
masters at four hundred and two draft offices.
The sum of §3,349,747 44, being upwards of
seventy percent, of the net revenues of the Depart-
ment, was concentrated 111 the hands of the above-
mentioned depositaries. Of this sum £.3,021,455 62
wasdisbursedduiing the year,leaving $328,291 82
subject to draft on the 1st July, 1862. The re-
mainder of the net revenue was collected by mail
contractors by means of orders on postmasters at
collection offices, prepared and sent out by lire
Auditor, and through payments by postmasters
to mail messengers and special mail carriers.
The number of postage stamps and stamped
envelopes issued to postmasteis during the >ear
ending June 30,3 £62, is given m detail 1 -i tiic table

The scarcity of snndl change, togeihei vvi;h the
general misconception of the pin port of the act of
Con;n ess approved 27th July, 3662, directing the
See: etai y of the Treasury to fur rush " postage and
othei stamps of the Uniiect States" for currency,
has greaPv embniiassed the Department m the
performance of Us duties connected with tin* dis-
tribution of postage stamps As soon as the pas-
sage of the act was announced, extraordinary
quantities were pin chased at the various post
offices, ex Iran ft tin j, the supply, in many in.c i a noes

stamps to persons evidently designing them for
use as currency, but notwithstanding the precau-
tions taken and the cheeks adopud at th" we veral
offices, the demand ha*, until quite recently, been
largely in advance of the daily manufacture.

ed to put n:U> circnlanon stamps once .ised for
postage, fiom whieli the canceling marks had
been wholly or paitially erased.
In pursuance of i!y provisions of an act ap-
proved July 16,1362, this D-'par ttr.ent has endeav-
ored to punish, and to prevent thereby, as well as
by the attammentofa more effectual mode (^can-
cellation, the fraudulent use or sale of canceled
postage stamps. The law, to be effective in its
purpose, should absolutely prohibit the removal
of canceled stamps from the paper to which they
are attached, for whatever puipose. Not being
criminal in itself, it should be made so by Statute,
to prevent the evil consequences of the practice.
An effort has been made to procure a canceling
ink which cannot be effaced without involving the
destruction of the postage stamp; and three vari-
eties of ink claimeu to possess this quality are now
being tested by actual use in post offices.
Vaiious new instiuments and devices for can-
celing postage stamps have been examined and
submitted to a tual, and two machines are now
m process of construction which are designed to
replace canceling by hand at the larger offices.
The issue of'* postage currency " by the Treas-
ury Department will doubtless soon displace post-
age stamps from circulation; and although the
redemption of stamps sold by postmasters^ not
requited by existing law, in order to protect hold
ers of the same against loss, so far as this can bo
done without detriment to the inteiests of (heDe •
paitment, 1 have determined to direct postmas-
, ters to exchange, foi United States notes, under
pi cper regulations, all evidently uncanceled
stamps offered them for that purpose.
The total value of stamps and stamped envel-
opes sold dm ing the fiscal year was >6,910,131 89,
and the amount canct led m payment of postage
was §6,171,751 93, leaving £>738,379 96 m tlrn
hands of purchase! s.
In my last repoita change was recommended
in the system of issuing postage stamps and
stamped envelopes, so that in lieu of being de-
livered, as at present, on orders from postmasters,
and charged in their accounts, the latter might be
1 equired, at the discretion of tire Postmaster Gen •
eial, to purchase, under proper regulations, such
quantities as might be needed at their respective
offices. The subject is again commended to the
consideration of Congress.
There are advantages incident to the employ-
ment of stamped envelopes for correspondence
which separate postage stamps do not possess.
The address and sealing of the foimcr pieclede
tlu ir use a second time, while the latter are sub-
ject to such fraudulent use if imperfectly canceled,
or if the canceling marks have been erased. On
the othei hand, stamped envelopes relieve the pub-
lic from the trouble and delay of attaching sepa-
rate stamps, which, in the hurry of business, is
not unftvquently forgotten, while the stamps are
also liable to icmoval, accidental orotherwise,oc-
casioning a detention ofletters. Correspondence
| covered by stamped envelopes can, moreover ,be
I lawfully conveyed outside the mail. 1 wi uld
j theiefoie suggest that the Postmaster Genera be
| authorized to sell stamped envelopes, in quanti-
ties of not less than five hundred, at a discount
not exceeding five per cent, on the charge made by
the Post Office Department for smaller quantises
thereof, which chaige should include the value of
the postage stamp impressed thereon. Andasan
additional inducement to stationers and other de^l*
eislo provide themselves with var ieties of stamped
etivt lopes suited to the wants of their customers,
and to make such envelopes a part of their stoc.K
in trade, it has been determined to try the exp*.-
lment of embossing postage stamps on envelop©-*
belonging to puvate mdi vidua Is or firms, who shah ,
have previously applied for the privilege, and havfl
J paid the full value of the stumps, (hss the dis
' count, if the same shall be allowed by law, as sug-
!. gestid,) provided the number shall not be less Llm«
; live hundred 111 any one case.

; thirty-thrt e eases of post office robbeues in Ken-
tucky, Missouri, Kansas, Virginia, Maryland,
and Pennsylvania, where the losses have been
;! occasioned by reason of occupancy by United
States or rebel soldiers. Such losses not having
resulted from any fault or neglect of the post-
b masters, the eases, it would seem, are materially
