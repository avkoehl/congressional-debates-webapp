HDQRS. DEPT. OF VIRGINIA AND NORTH CAROLINA,August 22, 1864-10.10 a.m.

General GRANT:

Signal officer reports, 6.50, six trains passed during night toward Richmond. Fifteen cars loaded with troops 6.45 a.m. toward Richmond: 2,500 cavalry toward Petersburg; twenty cars with troops toward Petersburg. Is it not relieving the field troops in the trenches with fresh troops from the north side of James?

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 22, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Commanding, &amp;c.:

Prisoners and deserters taken this morning report the enemy's loss very heavy yesterday. I think it most likely the troops seen going toward Richmond are wounded men going to hospitals. Those moving toward Petersburg are likely troops getting back from the north side of the river. General W. H. F. Lee is reported mortally wounded in yesterday's engagement.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., August 22, 1864.

Major-General BUTLER, Commanding, &c.:

I think it will be well to hold the Tenth Corps ready to make the effort that was proposed for this morning for a day or two before moving it. The enemy may be induced to move most of his troops from your front in the hope of dislodging us from the Weldon road.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

I will keep the sharpest possible lookout upon the movements of the enemy in my front, and will be all ready to move at once, day or night. At 10.35 twenty-seven wagons, fourteen ambulances, and 300 cavalry passed toward Petersburg; thirteen wagons toward Richmond.
