as possible, and start as soon as you could, arming the dismounted men with whatever you could get, and leaving an officer behind to bring forward the good arms as soon as they arrive. If horse equipment and horses cannot be obtained from the bureau seize such as can be found. I fully agree with you in regard to the impolicy of hurrying into the field half prepared. It is expensive and injurious to the service, and I do not wish you to think I am any party to the necessity which impels us to do such things. I am as unwilling as you or Major Chambliss, but you must not forget we are all under the authority of others. General Thomas himself manifests every desire in the world to give us time, but Hood is very near, and the authorities in Washington are very anxious. I beg you to assume Major Chambliss that I bear ample testimony to his activity and zeal in furnishing remounts and in hurrying troops to the field. I am sure he has done everything in his power, and ought to be gratified with the result. I am sorry that arms cannot be furnished more rapidly, and that horse equipments are brought forward so slowly. I wish you to bear in mind, however, that when your command does come, I would like to have it completely equipped. After conversing with General Garrard, I am inclined to make no change in your command, except to transfer the First Ohio out of it, leaving you eight old regiments. If this one regiment is the one you wish transferred, please regard the matter settled, and make your arrangements accordingly.

Hoping that you will be able to leave Louisville very soon and with a complete outfit,

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
