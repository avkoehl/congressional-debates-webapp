APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[March 15,
Senate,
The Tariff—Mr. Scott.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
Mr, SHERMAN. Fourteen millions.
Mr. SCOTT. He has added $14,000,000,
which would be $8,000,000 over tlie estimate
I have made. These $8,000,000 added would
make an excess of $50,97-1.000. I think the
estimate of the chairman of the committee is
certainly not excessive in view of the experi-
ence of the current year.
The question presented, then, is in what
manner is this reduction of $50,000,000 to be
made? In looking at that, the recommend-
ations of the head of our finances are cer-
tainly first entitled to our consideration and
respect. AVhat are they? First lie says:
" In the suggestions I have the honor to make in
reference to the reduction of taxes, I keep in view
two important facts: first, that the ability of the na-
tion to pay at least $50,000,030 annually of the prin-
cipal of the public debt shall not be impaired; and
seeondly, in the change of the revenue system, no
violence shall bedoneto thebusiness interests of the
country."
He proceeds:
"It is practicable to dispense with all revenue
from internal sources, except that derived from
stamp-5, spirits, tobiicco, and malt Ijquors. These
sources should furnish lor the year 18/2-73 a revenuo
of about SAM,000,000, making a reduction of taxes
of $16,000,000."
Showing, tlien, an estimate of customs which
would authorize a reduction of $'20,000,000
more, making in all $36,000,000, and which,
under the increased receipts from customs, will
be safely placed at $50,000,000. He proceeds
to '"recommend to the consideration of Con-
gress the reduction of the duties on salt to the
extent of fifty per cent., the duty on bitumin-
ous coal to fifty cent3 per ton, the reduction
of the duty on raw hides and skins, and the
removal of all duties from a large class of arti-
cles produced in other countries which enter
into the arts and manufactures of this country
and which are not produced in the United
States, and the revenue from, which is incon-
siderable." He further states:
" The removal of duties from alarge class of articles
used in manufactures, and the reduction of the duties
upon coal, lurnish an opportunity for a moderate
decrease of the rates of duties upon those products,
whoso cost will be diminished by these changes.
While nothing as the consequence of legislation
could be more disastrous to the public prosperity
than a policy which should destroy or seriously dis-
turb the manufacturing interests of the country, it
is still possible, by wise and moderate changes,
adapted to the condition of business and labor, to
reduce the rates of duties with benefit to every class
of people."
We here have the Secretary's policy, which
may he summarized thus:
1. The abolition of all internal taxes but
those on stamps, spirits, malt liquors, and
tobacco.
2. A reduction of duties on coal, salt, raw
hides, and skins.
3. An enlargement of the free list to embrace
raw materials not produced in the United
States.
4. A moderate decrease of duties on pro-
ducts whose cost will be diminished by these
changes.
The first three of these recommendations are
specificorso nearly so as to leave little room for
diversity of opinion in their application. The
fourth leaves room for some difference of
opinion in its application.
Let us see how much of the proposed re-
duction will be effected by carryingout the spe-
cific recommendations: first, internal taxes
$16,000,000; second, coal reduced to fifty cents
per ton would cause a reduction of $322,882 ;
third, salt as reduced by the bill will make a
reduction of $558,050 08 ; fourth, raw hides
and skins at the rate reported would make a
reduction of $671,589 09 ; fifth, the free list
§3,137,030 87.
There have been a few changes made by the
committee since I made these estimates,which
perhaps vary the amount on the free list to
some small extent. These estimates are based
upon the imports for the year ending June 30,
1871, and they make an aggregate reduction
of $20,719,552 04. Now, the bill reported by
the committee proposes to reduce duties, in
addition to those specifically recommended
by the Secretary, on the following articles,
namely: by section one, on tea, coffee, rice,
potatoes, lumber, and furniture, fruit and
ornamental trees, garden seeds, lead, ginger,
twine, hemp-yarn, roots, cocoa, and iron-wire
cloth; by section two, ten per cent, of the
existing duties is taken off the articles therein
named, being chiefly textile and metallic pro-
ductions, aggregating a reduction of $8,274,-
716 51, as estimated upon the basis of the
imports for the year ending June 30, 1871.
The whole reduction of duties, as proposed
by the bill, is $22,507,353 26. If to these you
add the proposed reduction of internal taxes,
amounting to $16,000,000, the total reduction
will be $38,507,353 26. Take the whole pro-
posed reduction of duties, $22,507,353 26, and
deduct from it the proposed free list, $3,137,-
030 87, the proposed reduction on tea and cof-
fee, $7,646,588 29, and $11,723,734 10 will be
what is proposed to be taken from the present,
duties upou articles produced in our own coun-
try. This takes nearly one fourth of the pro-
posed reduction from duties on articles which
come in competition with the industries of our
own people, and, as will be observed by exam-
ining the articles enumerated in sections one
and two, they are not largely made up of those
which would come within the recommenda-
tions of the Secretary of the Treasury, namely,
those whose cost of production would decrease
by the reduction of duty upon coal and raw
materials. These modifications affect alike the
manufacturer, the agriculturist, the miner, and
all dependent upon them. Coal, salt, rice,
potatoes, hides, lumber, furniture, lead, iron,
cotton, wool, fruit trees, garden seeds, &e., all
come in for reduction.
Agreeing with the purpose of the Committee
on Finance to pay $50,000,000 annually of
the debt, and at the same time reduce taxes
and duties to as large an amount as safety
will permit, I feel constrained at this point
to differ from the maj&rity of the commit-
tee as to the mode adopted in effecting that
reduction.
Presuming that the reduction of internal
taxes to the amount of $16,000,000 will be
added to the bill, (and it may as well go into
this bill as into a separate one ; we have the
power to add it as well as any other amend-
ment,) the redaction stops at $38,000,000.
Now, instead of reducing duties on tea and
coffee, add them to the free list, and you have
$12,000,000 more, ($7,000,000 having been
computed as reduction, and the whole revenue
from them for 1871 being $19,000,000, J which,
if the other features of the bill stand, would
carry the reduction to $50,000,000.
But there are features of the bill which ought
not to stand, and there are other internal taxes
which we can repeal if we do not permit those
features to remain. What are they? Strike
out the reduction of duties made by the first
and second sections, and, instead thereof,
make tea and coffee free, reducing the revenue
$19,000,000; permit the free list to stand as
proposed, $3,137,030; repeal stamp duties
$16,000,000, and other internal taxes, as
proposed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
$16,090,000 more, and you have an aggregate
of $54,137,030.♦ Bat in this last proposed
reduction, $16,000,000 of internal revenue
taxes r.amed by the Secretary of the Treasury,
are included $6,500,000 of income tax, which
he estimates would f-emain over uncollected
and be received in the fiscal year ending June
30,1873; and as we can now entertain no hope
of relief from that hated incubus, which I
trust will never more be renewed, the reduc-
tion for that year would be less than $6,500,000,
on the Secretary's assumption that it will not
all be collected in the current fiscal year', and
$6,500,000 will ran over into the next. Tbe
repeal of these internal taxes it may safely be
presumed will reduce the estimated expendi-
tures in collecting them at least $1,500,000. .
I observe that the chairman put it at $2,500,000
or $2,000,000, and I am below his estimate.
This, and the $6,500,000 of income tax, will
reduce the $54,137,030 to $46,137,030. If it
still be insisted that the Secretary's recom-
mendation as to coal, salt, and hides be ad-
hered to, they make them $1,582,521, and
you still have a reduction of $47,719,551,
or nearly three million dollars less than I
have shown, we may with safety reduce the
revenue.
Two modes are thus proposed. The one is
first to reduce the duties on tea and coffee
about one third of what they are at present;
second, reduce the present duties on manu-
factures ten per cent. ; third, adopt the free
list; and fourth, abolish $16,000,000 of inter-
nal revenue taxes, which, as I have already
shown, would actually be a reduction of only
$10,000,000, if the people pay the arrear-
ages of $6,000,000 of income tax. The other
mode is to make tea and coffee free, repeal all
internal taxes except those on spirits, malt
liquors, and tobacco, let the proposed free list
remain, and do not otherwise change existing
duties.
This substantially brings before the Senate
the two views of this question which have been
presented by the country ; and as the people
themselves have sent us their views of it, in-
stead of endeavoring to place them in any new
form, I adopt the two forms in which they
come before us in the petitions from opposite
sources.
In the first place, who are complaining of
these duties upon manufactures? Are they
our own people to any large degree? The
petitions that have been presented against
them are principally headed thus :
" Remonstrance of the American Free-Trade
League against the repeal of the duties on tea
and coffee."
I use the form of one presented by the Sen-
ator from Illinois, [Mr. Trumbull,] either at
the present or the last session. What do they
say?
" To the Senate and Souse of Representatives in Con-
gress assembled:
"The American Free-Trade League respectfully
remonstrate against the repeal of the duties on tea
and coffee, and would represent to your honorabla
bodies that such repeal would deprive the Govern-
ment of over thirteen million dolters of revenue"—
This was adapted to the previous year ; it is
now $19,000,000—
"and therefore render difficult the repeal of other
far more burdensome duties which yield but little
revenue to the Government at a very much heavier
cost to the people.
" That the true object of revenue reform is not to
repeal duties which are levied for revenue, and un-
der which ail the money taken from the people is
received by the Government, and contributes to pay
those expenses which the people must in some form
bear, but to reform the tariff so as to repeal those
duties which yield little revenue, and tax the people
heavily to support favored monopolies.
"The League respectfully represent that the money
which is taken from the people by the duties on tea
and coffee is received by the Government, but that
theuuties on iron, lumber, blankets, coal, salt, take
many millions trom the people, of which onlya very
small portion is received by the Treasury, thelarger
part going as tribute to favored manufacturers."
They proceed to illustrate by examples and
figures, and then close with this prayer;
"Your remonstrants would further show that if
the duties on carpets, pig and refined iron, thread,
common window-glass, paint, lumber, blankets,
clothing, leather, were repealed, the loss to the rev-
enue would be about the same as the loss occasioned
by the repeal of the duties on tea and coflec; but
the saving to tho people would be in the ease of tea,
and coffee only $13,000,000: whereas the repeal of
the duties on pig and refined iron alone would
