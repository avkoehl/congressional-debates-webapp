APRIL 1, 1865-9.30 a.m.

Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I reached the crossing of the Gravelly Run early this morning and met General Sheridan there. We are massed at that point by his direction. I did not meet General Sheridan personally; General Griffin, leading the column, saw him.

If we remain in this vicinity we can get rations by the Boydton plank road; we were unable, except in part, to replenish yesterday, as ordered. The enemy did not follow with a single man when we left the White Oak road this morning.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
