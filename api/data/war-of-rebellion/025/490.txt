SULLIVAN:

What success did you have in collecting forage and subsistence? You had better collect all the bacon and meat from the secessionists in town to use in case of emergency. If they don't like the association of Yankees, let them move south among their friends.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, December 26, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

Can you collect enough to mount three or four regiments of infantry to pursue Forrest? If you can, do it.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., December 26, 1862.

General SULLIVAN:

Have you a force moving north sufficient to drive our the rebels from the road? Those fellows should be kept off the road at least.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

[DECEMBER 26, 1862.]

General S.:

It is important that the road between you and Corinth and the Junction should be secure beyond a peradventure. Have you made arrangements to send for four regiments at Davis' Miss?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

DECEMBER 26, 1862.

SULLIVAN:

My cavalry is now in pursuit of Van Dorn, and must be near Grenada. They will be well tired out by the time they return. Do you hear anything of the force ordered from Fort Henry to co-operate with you?

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

DECEMBER 26, 1862.

SULLIVAN:

Make the best disposition you can to drive Forrest out, and communicate with me often what you are doing. Good-night.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.

HOLLY SPRINGS, December 26, 1862.

General SULLIVAN, Jackson:

Dodge learns from persons who saw Forrest cross the Tennessee River that he has but 3,500 men at the furthest. Act on the theory that he has no more.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
