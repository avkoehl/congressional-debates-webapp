Numbers 2. Report of Captain William L. Gross, Assistant Quartermaster, Assistant Superintendent U. S. Military Telegraph.

DANVILLE, January 29, 1865.

Thirty-five guerrillas, under Captain Clarke, all dressed in Federal uniform, entered Danville this morning. They robbed some of the citizens and one boot store and left on the Perryville pike at 11.15 a. m. They claimed, at first, to be Federal troops, Fourth Missouri Cavalry, but there is no doubt they are guerrillas in disguise. They gutted my office here pretty effectually.
