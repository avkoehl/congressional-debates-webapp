GENERAL JACKSON WAS TO* SERVE BCT OUE tEIUiJ
But this is not all lliere were other pledges.
You lemember, Mi Chairman, how strenuously
it was maintained daiing the administration of
Mr Adams, that a Piesident should notbeacan-
didate for a second election It becamea favorite
doctune of the Opposition. It wasjustthen dis-
coveied that executive powei might be used by a
President to secuie his own continuance in office.
Thedangei of this was poitrayed in strong colors;
and General Jackson was the man in whose per-
son a itítoim was to he commenced, if the people
would honor him with their confidence Tne
suggestion took Thousands believed, and voted
foi the man who would retite at the end of foui
years' He was elected, and so strong did he
himself seem to be impressed with the danger of
givmgaPiesidentasecond election, thatheactual-
ly íecommended, in thiee successive messages to
Congress,an amendment to the Constitution, ren-
dering the Piesident ineligible foi a second teim,
and yet, when the four yeais diew near a close,
and the people looked to see him prepanng to
letire, behold, they found him prepanng to extend
ins iron reign through another ioui years' The
humbug hauseived its intended purpose It had
aided in putting down a pure Administration, and
now it must be exploded to sustain the power of
a coirupt one.
MEMBERS OF CONGRESS WEttE NOT TO BE APP0IVTED  I
TO 0ÍTICE                                           '
I come now to another pledge made antecedent '
to the flection which " put down" the " pure" 1
Admmistiation It was among theeaihest and |
loudest of the complaints against Mi Adams that
he had appointed Mi Chv, a membei of Con-
gress, to the office of Secietaiy of State You |
tememb«r, Mi  Chan man, the stereotyped charge
f " bargain and coiruption," as connected with I
that seUction,the sweeping effect of which, m
(he hands of us mventois, was as signal as the
wnvietion of us uttei groundlessness is now uni-
ersal     It was used not only to bring odium ¡
n the Administration for an act alieady done,
t ut to fill the countiy with apprehensions of fu- '
lie danger fiom the practice of appointing mem-
■ ers of Congress to office The conspnatois
¡uddenly became great stickleis for the purity of
tie representative bodies, and eagle eyed to see
ne danger to that puutyfiom the practice in
uestton Upon the people evei y where was urged
iie gieatand indispensable impoitance of a le-
'orru, which should exclude the membei s of those
f odies fiom Executive appointments, and Gen
eral Jackson was held up as the mail who would
•ffcctually   work   out   that  leform    and   secure
'ongiess from the conuption ot Executive in-
fluence
1 said that General Jackson wis held up as the
•hampion of this piomised íeíorm, Sir, theie
was moie than this     He held himself up in tint
hartctei at the very outset Of the canvass which
lesultcd in his elect on He was rominitid by
the Lesislatuie of Tennessee in O tober following
Ml Adams's mauguiation, and, on 'hatoccasion,
in thepiesenceof both Houses of the Legislature,
who give him agiand íeception foi that purpose,
handed in his icsignation of the seat he then held
in the Senate of the United States Tint tesigna-
tion I hold in my hand, and beg leave to lead a
poition of it Hie Geneial was not content with
meiely lesigning into their hands the tiust he had
received fiom them, nor, indeed, with an addition
of leasonsforit. There weie pmposes connected
with that occisión which such a paper could not
accomplish He had just been nominated for the
Piesidency, and it fell in with the plans of the
conspirators against the " pure" Admmistiation,
that he should seize that occasion to give counte-
nance to the charge against it of corruption, and
set forth, in due form, the danger to the inde-
pendence and purity of Congress from theappoint-
ment of its members to Executive offices This
purpose he accomplished by embodying in his
lesignatton a dissertation on the subject, whicn I
Will now read
Having descanted on the importance of the
ami ndment to the Constitution of the United
States proposed by the Legislature ofTennessee,
whereby the election of President should be made
dnectly by the people, without the intervention
of electors, he proceeded to say
" \\ ith a view to «ustam moretlfecluaHy, in practice the
axiom winch divides t le three greit elates ot power into
independí nt constitution il cheek-, I would piopo-e a pro
vision rmdering anv m< mhei ofCangres* ineligible toonice
under the l*eneral Government during tin term for which
he was elected, and lor twenty years thereafter, except in
cases of judicial office " * * * " The effect of
sucha constitutional provision is obvious Bylt, Congiess,
m a consideiable dt gree would be free from that connec
tion witti the executive department which at present gives
strong gtound ot appiehension and jeaio i-w on the part of
tlic people Mi mbeis, instead ol being tuhle to be with

vigil nice would be Icon mteirupted by party ft elings and
puty txcitements Calculations fiom mingue or manage-
ment wou'd fail,noi would theii deliberations or investiga
lions of subjects consume so much tune The morals of
tlie country would be improved, and virtue, uniting with
the labors of the repiesentatives, and with the officiai mm
isters of the law, would tend to perpetuate the honor and
glory of tlie Government
" But it this change in the Constitution should not be
obtained, and important appointments eontinue to de\olve
on the representatives in Congres it requui s no depth of
th night t  be convinced that c irruption will become the
order of tlie day and that, under tin garb of conscientious
sacrifices to e&tabhoh precedents for the public good, evils
ot serious nnpoilaiice to the Aeedom and piosperity of the
Republic may arise It is thiough tills climnel that the

'Accept^ &e ,                      ANDREW JACKSOV "
It needs, Mr Chairman, but a slight acquaint-
ance with the history of the piesidential canvass
fiom 1S25 to 1829 to see the dnft and beanngof
thispxtiaoidiiii!) Jivijnniiim ?lr Clay had been,
I by the appointment ot the Piesident, transfened
' fiom the rlouse of Repiesentatives to the Depart-
| ment of State, and tlieieupon the clamoi of cor-
| luption had been laiscd, and a conspiracy foi med
to " put down" the Admimstiali in At this crisis
Genual Jukson v is biought out, and piesented
to the counli y as the man who was, to putan end
to the appointment of membeis of Congress to
ofh.ee, and di y up this souice of conuption. Under
h s admiius iation, legislative ptinty was to be
maintained, Conirtss was to be " fiee fiom that
connection with the executive department which"
i/iengave "strong ground of appiehension and
jealousy," legislative independí nee was to be
stii"tly guarded, " calculations fiom mingue and
management" were to "fail," the " moials of
the country " weie to be " improved," and " the
honor and «lory of the Gov eminent perpetuated'"
But this was not all If the interference of Exec
utue influence with legislative independence was
suffeied to " continue," bv the appointment of
members of Congress to office, it was the Gen
eial'sOTosisoieinn opinion that "coiruption "would
" become the order of the day," that " the people
would be attacked in their constitutional sover-
eignty," and that " tyranny" would "springup
in some favorable emeigency '" Human natiue
was then, in his opinion, very " prone to evil,
and the piopuety of the prayer, " lead us not into
temptation," was piesented to Ins mmd in ate ;/
imnie'nte light' His situation was " truly deli-
cate'" He could not descend from his "inte
pendent ground by intiiguing for the piesidential
|l clian '" and  felt " constian.ed to letire fiom a
I   situation " (the Senate of the United States) wh ie
he might be tempted to act with a view to his
"own n<roTandi7emont"'   What modesty and
II  delicacy'0 What purity and patriotism'    Who
could refuse to vote for the man who put forth
such sentiments, and gave to his countrymen suck
pledges?
Mr Chairman, it is no idle reminiscence that
calls up these pledges They throw a flood of
hght upon the administration of the present dy-
nasty, and set it fotth in bold and emblazoned
relief befoie the countiy. If they had b«en faith-
fully fulfilled, what praise would not have been,
bestowed upon the purity, patriotism and consist-
ency of their author' But, sir, they have npt
been fulfilled Every one of them has been vio-
lated—openly violated. Instead of striving to
maintain the legislative purity, this dynasty has,
ft om {he moment of its accession to power, sought
to assail and coirupt it. Instead of laboring to
sustain the independent, constitutional checks,
they have been trifled with and trampled on.
Instead of avoiding a connection between the Ex-
ecutive and Congress, which it was pretended
gave such strong giound of apprehension and
jialousy, that connection, in the most odious
foi ms of Executive interference and influence, has
been cai efully cherished and maintained Jnstead
of legislative independence, there has been legis-
lative subseiviency "Cilculationsfrom inttigu 
and management," instead of being " defeated,"
have been íelied on, and eoiiu/iijo  has, indua,
" become IIe oidei ofthtdiy "
Does anybody deny tins' Who is he' Can
he be an Adminislidtion man' Surely not, sir,
surely not, foi will /(i. not admit, can he icfuse to
admit, that all thi3 must necessaiily be connected
with the practice of appointing members of Con-
giess to o*liie> Did not General Jackson say
that it would'and will his fuends make him a
falst piophet Will they now contend, when the
appointment of members o^Congiess to office ha?
been vo y g> e«í/i| lnciensedby himself and his fa-
vorite suecessoi, that the consequences that he
predicted fiom the practice, as it existed before
such im lease, will not follow' If the appoint-
ment of members of Congress at the rate of five
in an admmistiation of four yeais (for that was
all that Mr Adams appointed) was to make cor-
ruption the oi dei of tlie day, and produce all the
evils piedicted, what amount of corruption, and
what multiplication of evils, must not have íesult-
cd fiom the appointment of twenty members of
Congress duiiug the fust four years of General
Jackson's admmistiation' And how ftaifully
must the conuption have been augmented and the
evils multiplied by the subsequent addition of
moie than twenty appointments of like chaiacter'
What a " sum" is here for political arithmetic !
What íesults would stare gentlemen in the face,
if they would apply the simple rule of thiee to
this case '
But startling as would be these results, they
would not exceed the reality, as evinced by every-
thing we see around us Sir, weaie ovet whelmed
with the evidence of conuption, intrigue, man-
agement, and legislative subseiviency which has
been gathering strength ever since the day that
Generil Jackson came into power, and "put
down" the " puie" Admmistiation What ob-
server of the " signs of the times" has not seen
it' Su, not a single Congiess has been elected
since that time whose members have not been
brought within the chai m of Executive influence,
by a libera1 distribution among them of the loaves
and fishes of oihee—a distiibution at the average
late of the appointment of about ten members of
each Congress' And, what is worthy of speci?!
notice, there have been several eases of membeia
of Congiess, who having failed of a reelection
by the "people, in consequerce of their unsctu-
pulous devotion to the Executive, were subse-
quently rewarded for that devotion by appoint-
ments at his hands It would be worth a hule
inquiry to asceitam the amount which has been
paid as salaries, outfits, S.e.,undei such appoint-
ments, since this dynasty came into powei But
I have not found tune to make the full examina-
tion which I intend to make hereafter It was
stated by a gentleman fiom Kentucky, [Mr
Allan,] in a speech on this floor, in Match, 1836,
that the amount at that time f xceeJed fi e Initi-
aled and thn'y theusind dolíais It will be no
exaggeiation to estimate that it has swollen to
moie than seven hundnd thousand doltais    Seven
