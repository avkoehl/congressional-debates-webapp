Lieutenant TIDSWELL,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Our force in Howard County is certainly sufficient to take care of Quantrill if properly disposed and handled. The Ninth Cavalry Missouri State Militia will probably reach the district first of the week. I shall see you within a day or two.

Lieutenant W. T. CLARKE,Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Macon City, Mo.:

LIEUTENANT: Word has just reached me that a party numbering seventeen men, claiming to belong to Bill Anderson's gang, were in the northwest part of this county yesterday evening. They killed a man named Piper, and stated they intended killing all who had organized themselves into the militia of this country. Yesterday the citizens met at this place and organized a company. As these men are the most substantial citizens of the county, irrespective of age, I am of the opinion they may be effective. All my men are through the county notifying those drafted, and I am in hopes they may come across this gang.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

STAFF. GRAHAM,

Lieutenant-Colonel Seventieth Enrolled Missouri Militia.

Macon City, Mo.:

DEAR SIR: We are sorry to be under the painful necessity of informing you that a gang of jayhawkers or robbers made a raid a few nights ago through the Bottom, a little below here, shooting at one man eight times, taking guns, clothing, and money from some. In some instances they obtained their guns and broke them up in the yards of their owners. By some they were supposed to be soldiers from Kansas. The chairman of this committee was in the neighborhood the night the raid was made, but he was not apprised of their presence until the next morning. Had he been he would have followed them until they stopped and found out the rascals in that way. A watchful eye will be kept upon them by your committee.
