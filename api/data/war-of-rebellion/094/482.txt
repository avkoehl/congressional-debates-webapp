p.m., having received a fresh supply of ammunition, Lieutenant Ginn was ordered some 400 yards to the left, where he expended some sixty rounds of ammunition. He was then ordered by Captain Lowell, chief of artillery Second Division, some 100 yards to the right, where he expended sixty additional rounds upon a rebel battery immediately in his front. Thence Lieutenant Ginn was ordered by Major-General Smith to the left of my brigade. From this position he continued fire with three guns upon the battery in my front, and the other three upon a battery in front of the Third Brigade, until the final charge was made. Throughout the day the battery did good service, and, although most of the time in an exposed position, its firing was rapid, accurate, and effective, expending 923 rounds of ammunition during the action.

A few minutes before 4 p.m., everything being in readiness, General Garrard's order was received to charge the enemy's works. The order was instantly given to my command and as instantly obeyed. From right to left my entire infantry command sprang to their feet, raised the crest of the little hill in front, gave a wild hurrah, and pressed directly forward. Notwithstanding a severe fire of musketry, grape, and canister, which, but for the fact that it was delivered too high, must have terribly torn my ranks, the whole line pressed eagerly on. As we passed the skirmish line, Captain Kittel, Fifty-eighth Illinois Volunteer Infantry, with admirable skill, collected his skirmishers on the run and joined in the charge. The rebels were seen to leave their rifle-pits and rush back over the works, and when within fifty paced of their line, a last volley of musketry, grape, and canister was poured upon my line, but it also passed almost harmless through the air over out heads. In a few minutes more the whole command had reached and passed the enemy's entrenchments, killing and capturing some of the artillerists at the guns, whilst the main line of the rebels ran in every direction. Five cannon were passed by my brigade, but, by my direction, were left without a guard, and the whole command ordered forward in pursuit of the enemy. Prisoners were taken singly and in squads numbering as high as thirty, most of whom were simply disarmed and ordered to the rear, which seemed very much in accordance with their desire. The command pressed on to the foot of and some distance up the base of the mountain, where I was ordered to halt. From the heights above, Captain Harris, Thirty-sixth Mississippi, hung out the white flag, and, with a few men yet with him, came down and were passed to the rear. Regimental commanders report not less than 150 prisoners taken in the pursuit. William May,* a private of Captain Benson's company (H), Thirty-second Iowa Infantry, as we approached the works, dashed forward and captured the battery guidon, which is now in my hands. Several of the official papers of the battery were also captured, showing it to have been A. Bouanchaud's. I am thus explicit in relation to the capture of the five guns, as I have been informed that they were claimed by some other command, which drew off the guns long after my brave men had captured and passed them in pursuit of the enemy.

The Tenth Kansas occupied the crest of the mountain as picket, and my command bivouacked for the night at its base, whence on the morning of the 17th it set out with the division in pursuit of the whipped, demoralized, and routed enemy.

Regimental commanders report excellent conduct on the part of both officers and men of their respective commands, which, as far as my observation extended, I do most heartily indorse and confirm.
