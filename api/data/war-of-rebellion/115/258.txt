DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, March 10, 1862.

Right Honorable Lord LYONS, &amp;c.

MY LORD: I have had the honor to receive your note of the 6th instant in which after reverting to the correspondence with has passed between us concerning the treatment experienced by the crews of the British schooners Revere and Louisa Agens you state that Her Majesty's Government cannot but regard the putting of seamen belongint to those vessels in irons under the circumstances in which and for the period for which this was avowedly done as wholly unjustifiable.

In reply I have the honor to observe that it is believed that except in the cases of the Revere and Louisa Agnes and one other case which has just been brought to my notice no complaints whatever have reached this Government during the existing rebellion of harsh treatment of persons on board of vessels captured by our naval forces. And when in the first two of those cases a complaint was preferred by you the Secretary of the Navy, though perfectly convinced in his own mind of their humanity, lost no time in enjoining upon the flag officers of our blockading squadrons kindness in all cases toward captured prisoners and that irons be used only when and as long as may be necessary for the safety of the captors and the prizes. If, however, our naval officers are in any case justly chargeable with rigorous treatment of persons taken by them from on board prize vessels such persons have their judicial remedies in our courts of law.

I have the honor to be, with high consideration, your lordship's obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
