HDQRS. SECOND DIVISION, FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,July 10, 1864.

Captain McCLURG,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourteenth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: I have just returned from the river. The enemy is all across the other side and the bridges burnt. I have two regiments on the bank of the river at the railroad crossing. The enemy skirmished pretty sharply from the opposite bank, but it is unnecessary to keep so large a force there; a small picket is sufficient. Please inform the general commanding of the above report and ask him for instructions.

Very respectfully,

JEF. C. DAVIS,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Division.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

My scouting party sent to Johnston's Ferry this morning returned to camp; report no picket at that point. It was withdrawn day before yesterday.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. B. DORR,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.- I sent word by Lieutenant Belfield that the forces of General Schofield now hold the opposite side of the river from my outposts at Powers' Ferry and Cochran's Ford. They are fortifying the ridge upon which the rebel battery was planted at Powers' Ferry.

DORR.
