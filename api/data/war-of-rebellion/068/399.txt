Savage says that the enemy have thrown shells this side of Rocky Run. Your train has gone out. Let us hold on as long as possible at the outposts, and if it be necessary to fall back, let it be done in order. I will notify Colonel Savage that he must look out for anything that you may send by way of the race course. Keep a good lookout on the Neuse road. Our boats are guarding the river well at the blockade. I will tell Colonel Savage to hold on to Rocky Run as long as possible. I will be at the office to talk with you all night. I think that at daylight we may look out for whatever is to come. Send to General Harland, as he is now in command. We will be together.

PALMER,

General.
HEADQUARTERS OUTPOSTS,May 4, 1864 - 9.50 p. m.

General PALMER:

Your telegram of 9.15 p. m. is received. I am certain that the rebels came down to Core Creek Sunday last, and blockaded the road by felling heavy trees. Upon this was based my telegram of yesterday p. m., saying that New Berne was not now menaced, &amp; c. I have a reconnaissance out now, and if no force is by this time at the Dover Forks, no attack will be made here. I doubt the enemy having any infantry at the Gully, from the fact that my officer of the day saw a cavalryman with carbine stand picket afoot, which would not be done had they infantry. I may be mistaken; but I think it is cavalry, with a howitzer or two.
