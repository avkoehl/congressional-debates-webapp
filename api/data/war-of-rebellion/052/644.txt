WAR DEPARTMENT, Washington, September 15, 1863-4.30 p. m.

Major-General ROSECRANS,

Chattanooga, Tenn.:

From information received here to-day it is very probable that three divisions of Lee's army have been sent to re-enforce Bragg. All the available forces in the Departments of the Ohio and Cumberland should be brought to the front to meet the enemy. Sherman and Hurlbut will bring re-enforcements to the Tennessee River as rapidly as possible.

H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief.

WAR DEPARTMENT, ADJUTANT-GENERAL'S OFFICE, Washington, D. C., September 15, 1863.

There being no draft in Indiana, officers and men who have been instructed to report at rendezvous at Indianapolis are ordered to return to their regiments.

E. D. TOWNSEND,
