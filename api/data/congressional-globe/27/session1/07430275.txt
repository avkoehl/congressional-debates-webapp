local banks being discredited, no way was found Of
paying public expenses in Alabama, but by issuing
comptroller's warrants These would not circu
late, as some thought, because they were on bad
paper, and not handsomely printed, whereupon,
it was proposed to send to Philadelphia for blank
warrants, handsomely engraved, and printed on
silk paper "
" In 1824, Hunlsville (Alabama) notes," says
the same author, "were at thirty per cent discount
at Philadelphia"
The prices current of Philadelphia prove that
the paper-money oí Kentucky was at a discount
of from 35 to 45, and from that to 55peí cent, du-
ring the year 1820 The same year, Alabama
notes were at a discount of from 10 to 15 per cent ,
Mississippi notes from 10 to 16 percent , and Ten
nessee notes from 10 to 20 per cent discount
In September of the preceding year, (1825 ) the
notes of the New Orleans banks were quoted m
the Philadelphia papers "at fifty-six per cent be-
low par" In August, 1819, No'th Carolina
money was at a discount oí from 20 to 25 per cent
at Baltimore, Kentucky currency from 15 to 23,
Ohio banks 10 to 50, Indiana, Illinois, and Mis-
souri, 15 to GO In 1820, the following banks oí
Pennsylvania had then notes subjected to the
annexed discount—"not as estimated in specie,
but as estimated in Philadelphia paper "—(See
Gouge on Ranking )
Marietta Bank,           33 per cent discount
Centre Bank,               25

The facts which I have adduced prove conclu-
sively that the national bank did not, in times gone
by, protect the people from a vitiated and fluctua-
ting currency    So signal was its failure, that the
advocates oi the bank, by their own admissions, as
well as by their anxiety to  augmeut the tariff m
1824, upon the ground lhat something must be
done to relieve the country, unwittingly, perhaps,
acknowledged that their former bug it and san-
guine expectations   of the   man)   great benefits
likely to enure to the country by the incorporation
of the bank  had  been   disappointed     Similar
causes and like pnnciples of action must tend to
produce the same exact results    So, therefore, if
the principles upon-which  all of our banks, both
State and Federal, aie based, are pretty much the
the same,—and inasmuch as they are guided by
similat rules of action, and the same instincts qí
mterest,—we have no well founded reason to war-
rant the supposition that the largest bank of the
whole is to deviate so fat from the ím anab e con-
duct of all othei banks, as to preler to play the
odious and unprofitable part of a regulatoi of the
minor banks    Inasmuch as money is invested m
bank stock with  the sole view of secunty and
profit, it cannot reasonably be supposed that the
president and  directors of a   United States, Bank
would be more patriotic than those of the other
banks, or that they would not conduct their opera-
tionslikeall other bankers, with a view tofhegreat-
estprofif   Cases might be imagined wheie the intei-
est of the bank and the weliaie of the community
mi'ht ran counter to each other, and it wou'd be
strange, indeed, to expect a large bank, any sooner
than the smaller banks, to forego its mteiest to sub-
sen e considerations of public policy    In me apt
and forcible language of Mi  Applcton, foiinerly
a member of this House, "It is not to be concealed
that there, are serious objections to the establish-
ment of a bank of the magnitude and power ne-
cessary to the regulation oí the currency     In the
firsi place, such a power is wholly contrary to the
spirit of our institutions, which are founded upon
'    the print tole ot ftee competition—of action and re
action amongst equals    A gieat ccntial power,

■¡iron" theie it no temedy, or none without a con-
tuition    la fact, the great and decided objection
to a bank of great power, to act as a general[reg-
ulator oí tne currency, is the apprehension that it
may ttseli suspend specie payments, under the
sanction of the General Government, and thus
fix upon the country an inconvertible paper cur-
rency. This dangei is much greater with a
gt= «wtional banl than without it" The same
write* furt e- remarks, that "it cannot be denied
that Mi ._ lddle, in his management, w as for mai y
years eminentij successful, to far as the interests
of the bamk vete concerned It may, however, be
doubled whether the country is undpr any great
obligation to him as a regulator of Hue cuirency, so
far as relates to fluctuations in the money market
Severe revulsions took place in 1826, 1829, and
1832, and the Bank of the United States took its
full shaie m the expansions which preceded them
It was the general impression of those w ho watch-
ed Mr Biddle's course, that he was a bold navi-
gator, that he kept his ship under a press of sail,
relying upon his skill m taking in canvass m case
of a squall, of which he has occasionally given us
evidence him elf Now, a legulaloi thould go
fot secunty lather than profit, with much bailott,
carrying light tail No one can doubt that his
contractions in 1834, so distiesting to llie com-
munity, were pushed beyond reasonable measuie,
for the purpose, by that means, of effecting thcieneiml
of the charla, undo pretence of the necessity of
preparing for winding up its concei ns, whilst
his subsequent expansion had a full share m pro-
ducing the mad and wild speculations of 1835 and
1836 "

Mi   Gallatin, in his Suggestions on Banks and
Cunency, published m 1841, observes that "the
only way in which a Bank of the United States can
regulate the local cunencies, is by keeping its own
loans and discounts within narrow  bounds, and
rigorously i equinng a reg tlar pa} ment of 'he bal
anees due to tt by the State banks     The object might
be attained without its aid, in places w here the loe al
banks will, by adopting the same couisc, chect each
other, andrezulale themselves     VVhpre this does not
take place, the interference of the national bank is of
great importance and highly useful     But the meas
ureis piactically difficult, andg-naallyunpopular,
though it might be rendered more palatable if the
bank were Jmbidden to use the public d'e'pautes, be-
j ond a certain amount, for «sown benefit "   " It is
perfectly clear that it cannot art asa legvlalot of
local cunencies in those p'aces  where the banks,
iiom any cause whatever, con'inue tosuspend their
specie payments "    " Some other a<h antages, of a
more doubtful nature, seem to be expected fiom a
Bank of the United States—such as an met ease of
commercial facilities, a greater uniformity a do
mestic exchanges, and a hope that its notes may,
to a great extent, advantageously snpeisede tho-e
of the local banks '    " An increase of the mass of
commercial loans is not at all desirable     The
number of banks and the amount of their discounts
are already too great "    " The great inequality and
fluctuations of the dome-tic exchanges  so far as
they are the result of depreciated currencies, cannot
Jbeiemedied by a Bank of the United Sta'es, as long
as they continue to be the local circulating medi-
um "    " It is a great error to suppose that it can
afford a generally uniform currency, oi one v hick
shall at the same time be of the tame i dine 1 ,i all places
This is to confound exchange and currency, aid to
suppose that pape; money may not only be a true
representative of gold andsihei,bit can pel form
ihat which gold and sih er cannot acrompl si) '

I lency decteasing    These causes cou'd pioduee no
otherresult    Had these causes not exvMed, the pre
I miums of exchange would not hoie been high    In
some places, though the banks pretended to pay
specie for their notes they evaded H in effect    Let
the currency be sou d, and the premiums of ex-
change must be precisely just"
We learn from this testimony of the late nation^
bank that the rate of exchange is not regulated by
a United States Bank, but that it depends upon the
payment of specie by the banks. If they Will n t
pay specie, they ought to be abolished, if they do
pay it, then exchanges cannot be excessively high.
In his address to the stockholders of the baijk in
1831, Mr. Biddle declared, " As long as the general
currency of the United States consists of specie or
itsequnalent,the rates of exchange between any
two places in it can never much ot permanently
vary from the expenses of their transportation fiom
one place to another; and a reduction to nearly
that rate was the inevitable consequence of ihere-
tumptiem of specie payments "
The authorities I have cited are so explicit and
conclusive on this point, that I deem it unnecessary
to dwell longeron it    Indeed, if to this weight oí
authority be added the general conduct of the late
United States Bank, we must be constrained to admit
that the reasons against the passage of the present
bill are conclusive.   For it has been shots n that the
national bank did not regulate the currency , that
existing causes and passing events embarrassed that
institution, as well as the State banks    Kay, sir ,
w e have seen the federal bank expand its circula-
tion, and the State banks following suit "partpojssu."
Again   when orders were given to contract the-
currency and call in  its notes, we find that the
screw was turned by all the banks simultaneously.
The history of the times proves that it played the 
part of a selfish, avaricious, and interested leader ¿
but never that of a wise and beneficent regulator,
Before concluding this branch <rt the subjeet, al-
low me to observe, ihat some leading pohtioians
urge that we should have a national bank because
Great Britain has a Bank of Eegland    The better
to understand the impolicy of imitating her example
let me cite a few passages from the dts.tmguisb.e4
English aulhnr, Thomas Tooke    In a lecentweik
of his on prices, state ot the circulation, coca-laws,,
and banking, in Great Britain, he remarks, m re-
ference to the conduct of the Bank of England m
attempting to telieve the trade oi this country m
1836 and 1837, that, "so far from having exerted
any power m stopping the American housesan tin-?
co miry, and the New York banks connected with
them, the Bank of England actually mmsed them
by advances without security for several months ;
and it was only on seeing no end to the piactice of
nursing, that m 1837 it found itself compelled to
discontinue its assistance"   "The trade of this
country requires no such fostering and forcing prcr
cess by operations of the Bank oí England, or any
other banks, in us behalf    An impiovement, pro-
duced by such means, cannot be sound , and still
less can the bank which professes to hold out such
artificial means and resources to trade be eons dered
to be under salutary oi safe regulation.   It is neither
more nor less than a system of officious tnt^rfefnee,
unbo tomed on any thing like correct principles,
and coming properly, therefore, under the designa-
tion of «¡ere quackery    It is, doubtless, a great point
gained, and is justly a matter of congratulation foi
The pubhe, that the imminent danger of suspension
of cash payments has been passed    But the escape
1 as been uñarían one, and attended by circum-
stances ofalmost national humiliation, lutheapplica-
tion of the Bank of England for assistance front
France "
" Now, according to the system professed on the
pai t of the bank m the examination before the com
mittee on the charlet m 1832, it was stated that,
aitnough against the effects of political discredit
and internal demand, the bank eould not be perfect-
■> secute, the foreign exchanges could ahoaysbe rso 
lified without a ensn " (Evidence of J. H Palmer,,
Esq —question'and answei 673 )
' How, then, has it happened, that, witheat wars,
ot revolutions abioad, and without cowunercial dis
ciedit or political com ulsion or panic, leading to an
internal demand for gold, the bank has not so regu-
lated it- issues as to tectify the exchanges, which,
accoidmg to the system propounded in 183-2, i*
would be able to do under ami ctrcum-'ances but
those of political discredit or internal panic >'
1 It is quite e'ear that no system at all has been
followed, and, what is more, no system has ecisted
The London Moi wing Chiomcleoithe 3d of June,
1839 observes, that" in a commercial countrv like
Grea't Britain the management of the paper circu-
lation is necessarily one of the most important, trusts
that it is possible to repose in anybody pi men, for.
