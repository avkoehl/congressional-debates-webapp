LEWIS E. HARVIE,

President Richmond and Danville Railroad, Burkeville:

SIR: I congratulate you on the gallant and successful defense of your road. I have no instructions to give except to use your own best judgment to press on supplies in a continuous stream to this place whenever the state of the road allows, and, if interrupted, then on to Lynchburg. Urge a daily flood to the greatest possible volume.

JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., May 15, 1864.

Order the Fifty-sixth Georgia Regiment and Twenty-sixth Alabama Regiment, Colonel O'Neal, to proceed immediately by railroad to Richmond. They must move promptly.

SPOTSYLVANIA COURT-HOUSE,

Via Guiney's Station, May 16, 1864.

His Excellency PRESIDENT DAVIS:

The enemy has made no movement against our position to-day. He has retired his right and extended his left toward Massaponax Church, occupying the line of the Ny River, his main force being apparently east of that stream.

R. E. LEE.

The enemy remained quiet in our front to-day. Late this afternoon he is reported moving in force to our right on the Telegraph road. His trains have been passing back toward Fredericksburg, apparently to procure fresh supplies.
