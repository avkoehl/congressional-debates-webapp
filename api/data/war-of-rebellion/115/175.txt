R. MURRAY, Esq., U. S. Marshal.

DEAR SIR: Inclosed please find the order from J. K. Millner upon which I paid W. H. Ludlow, esq., $150. I send it as requested by you.

[Sub-inclosure.]

FORT LAFAYETTE, October 24, 1861.

Lieutenant WOOD:

You will please pay to bearer $150 and charge to account. *

Yours, respectfully,

J. K. MILLNER.

OFFICE OF SUPERINTENDENT OF METROPOLITAN POLICE, New York, December 8, 1861.

E. D. WEBSTER, Esq.

DEAR SIR: Yours of 6th instant inclosing two letters addressed to Monsieur Charles Le Cesne, New York; one to Monsieur C. A. Robert, New York, and four to M. A. Herera &amp; Co., Havana, Cuba, is received. To-morrow I shall return the Herera letters to the post-office and restore the others to the parties to whom addressed. Monsieur Le Cesne is no doubt as clean as any man can be whose business connections have heretofore been very deep in cotton, but since the detention of his letters he has suddenly concluded to return to France, and has accordingly gone, family coach, horses, driver and all. However, his business remains here. I regard the movement as strange.

Very truly, yours,

JOHN A. KENNEDY,

Superintendent.

DEPARTMENT OF STATE, Washington, December 10, 1861.

JOHN A. KENNEDY, Esq., Superintendent of Police, New York.

SIR: I have received your letter+ of the 5th instant relative to the exaction of passes from persons going to California via Aspinwall. Your suggestions upon the subject of the adoption of a uniform rule are duly appreciated. I will thank you to call upon the agent of the steamers and after consisting with him to make such arrangements as in your opinion will best promote the public interests in the present exigency respecting the passenger whose real intention is to go to California. Should you, however, find it impossible to do so without the requirement of a passport in every case you will after reporting to this Department resuem the enforcement of the regulation first adopted.

I am, sir, your obedient servant,

WILLIAM H. SEWARD.
