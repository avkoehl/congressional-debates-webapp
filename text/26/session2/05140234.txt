Mr Chan man, the views vhich I have pre eitid
of our financial c nli'ion will, if rccuritd t , tufii
ciently show the «lound of the posunn wh ch I
now cltitmctly take Tnat position is, tin1 ten
millions of dollars oti"ht to be immediately bi r-ov-
cd foi tne service of the yeai lb41 I have shown
¡hat there will, by my estimates, be a deficit of
means to mett the indispensable engagements of
the year of dt least $7,500,000 It is quite as
likely to be more as to be ie*s. But if we had this
tarn, still, at the end ot the year, the Treasury
would be swept clean N body will dispute that
$2.500,000 is quite is small a sum a  it we tild be
at all prudent to depend on foi a ba'ave i ¡ th
Treasury.
Ten millions, men, is the leist *tim we ougist to
have And it is the boon Jen duty of thin Admim
tration t  p(ovidc ¡or u In the «i 'inary ci u"s<> oí

du y ot this Adoum>- ¡ation, with this Congress, ir>
which u h< Ids the political maj m j, to asnead the
law  'aying duties un imports so as to give, as soon
as poMb'e, and espec ajy for 1842, an ratreísed
revenue írom cus oms. This jt may do, prcbab'y,
without touehnp one really deba ef ble pont or
principle va relation to the tariff,keeping wi'hia th°
policy of ihe Compromise Act, and mak rg the
weaith) consumer  ot luxuries cont'ibute a fairer
proportion than they now do towards the puohc
burdens.
I hive only to repeat, here, that th  neglcci of
th- two principal measures now inverted to, by
this AdTumstratt in, ir ust, I snpprse, force 'he next
Administration unavoidably into th  ci'ling of -in
extra S"" sion of Cong ess Pt an ei^ly ñ?y If that
's th" purpose of those «ho row hold the ern'ri 1
here, we ohall know it ry what they oo, or rather
neglect to do, on th s «ubioct
Mr Cha rman, if h s Admini tra"on will do ifs

I hope that dut es on minor's will be so impo ed
—p.escrving, ^ I hope rasy be done, without sa-
enfc n  any freat national miarest, the policy of
the compromise act—that while we «-h«U hive re

Government, the rich shall not escape taction by

be relieved from undue ard heavy bnidens, and
