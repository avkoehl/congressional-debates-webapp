GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.

GREENVILLE, TENN., April 28, 1865.

Major G. M. BASCOM,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Knoxville:

Colonel Kirk has just arrived in town. His command turned back toward Asheville, with the infantry under Colonel Hawley, which left this a.m. Colonel Kirk says that on the 26th instant Colonel Palmer was expected in Asheville that day or the next, and that the rebels had gone out to meet him with a flag of truce. I have completed all necessary arrangements and shall start for Asheville to-morrow morning. I hope to be able to establish signal stations between Asheville and this place, and courier posts-between Asheville and the gaps in the Blue Ridge selected to be held by the infantry to keep open communication with the cavalry. I have written the commanding officer of the cavalry, requesting him, if he finds it necessary in the execution of his order, as he very likely will, to cut loose althogether from connection with my forces, to send me information of the fact.
