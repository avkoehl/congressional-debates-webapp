CITY POINT, VA., November 11 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

The enemy have been moving on General Terry's front all day, apparently massing troops to our right. At same time there appear to be troops massed north of the James, below our left, on the river. These are probably the troops reported yesterday to have left Hill's corps. If the enemy should attack Terry, it will be out of the question to re-enforce him from you, but be prepared to attack at Petersburg, either by moving to the left or on some weak point in front, as may seem best. The movements of the enemy may mean nothing, but they will bear watching.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., November 11, 1864.

Major-General MEADE:

If possible to prevent to-day's paper getting into the hands of the enemy, prevent it. They all contain news from the West most decidedly contraband.*

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Four conscript deserters have been forwarded that came into the lines of the Ninth Army Corps this morning. They are from the Eighteenth North Carolina, Lane's brigade, Wilcox's division. Left their brigade lying just to the rear and (our)left of the Jones house, where it has been lying for the last two weeks. it was understood that the brigade would move to-day a little father to right. Was told so by the men that came out from the trenches last night. Informants do not know of any movement, except a rumor that the whole army is extending its line farther to the right. No change had been made when they left to their knowledge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO C. BABCOCK.
