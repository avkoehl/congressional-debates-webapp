of my troops. I am expecting Foster and Thirty-seventh New Jersey hourly. Until they come the taking away of your details from depots will make it impossible to send others. All of your corps has been relieved except those. The enemy made a sharp attack on my line at daylight.

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

HATCHER'S, August 28, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY:

If Colonel Grubb had obeyed my orders yesterday he would have been able to have relieved the quartermaster's employes before this. He had positive orders to march some time ago, and if you can send down and get a detail from him before you can call back the quartermaster's party, you had better do so and can take your choice. This dispatch will be your authority.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

AUGUST 28, 1864 - 12.55 p. m.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I have directed Colonel McGilvery, as department commander, to remain here until all my batteries are in place and the officers fully instructed as to their duties, range, &amp; c. Colonel Piper has the same instructions on your side of the river, and will not be relieved by you until you wish it.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

Major-General BIRNEY:

Colonel McGilvery has been ordered to report to you.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.

AUGUST 28, 1864.

Major-General BIRNEY:

I inspected the front formerly occupied by General Foster at sunset last night, and General Carr's division, was there on the ground. General Foster should have reached you last night. Colonel Grubb sent me word a few moments ago that General Birney had authorized him to stay at Fort Converse. If you choose to keep the details of Colonel Cole's cavalry and let Colonel Grubb's regiment remain where it is I have no objection, but the only way to get scattered men to their commands is to order them peremptorily to join, and applications will soon come in for new details. I had so ordered with Colonel Grubb's regiment and with the details from the Tenth Corps at the depots, City Point, railroad, or elsewhere.

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General.
