JORDAN HOUSE SIGNAL STATION, September 9, 1864-12 m.

Major B. F. FISHER,

Chief Signal Officer, Army of the Potomac:

There is a large party at work on Fort Clifton, apparently making a new face to the south side of that work. The enemy are still at work opposite the Rushmore house. Only two limbers are visible there this a. m. There is a train of cars, one loaded with hay, the rest are boxcars, in Petersburg to our right of the Norfolk depot and near the railroad bridge. Nothing of the kind has been observed at that point before. Trains are moving both ways every day in Petersburg at the point where the dirt road to Richmond crosses the Lynchburg railroad.

Respectfully,

T. R. CLARK,

Captain and Acting Signal Officer.
