HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Halltown, Va., August 1864-5.30 p.m.

Brigadier General J. H. WILSON,

Commanding Third Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: General Torbert went over to see you to-day. The enemy last night concentrated at Smithfield and Leetown, those in my front falling back to Smithfield; or to some point between in Charlestown. Fitz Lee's cavalry fell back toward Martinsburg and to a point twelve miles from Williamsport. The indications are that they will fall back perhaps out of the Valley. The enemy this evening advanced a skirmish line toward Charlestown. I want you back here as soon as things are a little more developed. Tell Torbert to order back Custer. The enemy have either to cross the river or quit the Valley, leaving a minimum force to oppose me. The indications are that their projected campaign is a failure.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General J. H. WILSON,

Commanding Third Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: The indications are that the rebel army is falling back to leave the Valley. I want you to move your command to the Shepherdstown Ford at once, and if my information is correct you will get orders to join me quickly, crossing at that ford. If General Torbert is with you show him this. I will order Averell by Martinsburg.

Very respectfully,

P. H. SHERIDAN,
