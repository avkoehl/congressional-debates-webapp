no support coming from the rear, and a number of my men falling dead or wounded at every step forward, I, fearing that a panic might seize upon my men, gave orders to retire to the road, whereto the other regiments on my left had already retreated. From this position we fired some time on the enemy's flank, and were soon ordered to fall back in rear of the rifle-pits, where we remained as support until 6 o'clock in the evening, when we were ordered to occupy the rifle-pits, resting with our left wing on the road. Later in the evening, about 10 o'clock, we were ordered to move more to the right, and to relieve the regiments occupying the rifle-pits opposite the fort which had been blown up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

On the evening of June 12 the regiment left its position in front and marched during the night to Tunstall's Station, near the White House. Marched June 13 across the railroad to Jones' Bridge, left bank of the Chickahominy. Crossed this river June 14 and marched to Charles City Court-House, where the regiment rested until the evening of June 15, when we crossed the James River near Powhatan Point, marching all night, and arriving June 16 a few miles before Petersburg, where it took position on the left. Was ordered on June 17 to make a charge upon the enemy's works near the center, which charge was not successful, and whereby the regiment sustained a loss of 3 men killed, 1 officer and 7 men wounded. The enemy having evacuated the rifle-pits in our front during the night, the regiment charged again on June 18, and advanced beyond the Norfolk railroad, sustaining a loss of 1 officer, 3 men killed; 4 officers and 13 enlisted men wounded.

The regiment was marched on June 19 to the right of our position, relieving the Second Army Corps. Remained there till June 24, when the regiment moved toward the center, where it staid in the rifle-pits until July 25, when it was relieved, and marched back into the second line. Marched from there July 27 to the extreme left, covering the left flank and rear of the army, and was marched back toward the front in the evening of July 29, participating in the attack of July 30, as reported the 5th instant.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
