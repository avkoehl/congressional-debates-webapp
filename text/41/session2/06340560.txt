APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

Imports—Mr. Finhelnburg.
41st Cong....2d Sess.
by the bill itself, tbat I only point to the
ample provisions for securing the safety by
bond covering both the duties and the values
of the goods thus to be transported, and to
the fact that goods are now transported in a
similar manner and underbonds after appraise-
ment. To the argument based upon a sup-
posed disability resulting from geographical
position, it is not necessary to reply by counter-
assertions or to obvious truisms j for a very
brief trial of the law would convince the west-
ern merchant of the propriety of its repeal,
and enforce the illustration used that it is as
much the province of the merchant of the sea-
board cities to traffic with foreign countries
as for the western farmer to cultivate wheat;
and that while the farmer could by great exer-
tion stimulate a feeble growth of the cereal
named on the sands of the sea-shore, the fact
that it would not pay would restrain him from
attempting such foolish competition.
The assertion and the argument based upon
it are more readily and completely met by a
statement of the progress of the West in the
matter of direct importation.
Taking the statistics of St. Louis as an
example, it will appear that the amount of
duties paid upon foreign goods imported direct
to that point have increased so rapidly within
the last ten years that they now exceed by
more than a hundredfold the amount paid in
18G1. I will read, sir, the exact amount as
reported officially by the surveyor of that port:

It will be observed, sir, by this report that
in no instance has there been any retrogression
of enterprise, tbat in no instance has any year
been followed by a decrease in the next; but
that, on the contrary, the amount has steadily
progressed with the growth of the city named
and the expansion of its commerce with the
surrounding country, and that within the past
year that increase has exceeded $300,000, or
more than twenty per cent, of the gross amount
of collections. Nor, sir, do these figures rep-
resent the full amount of the present direct
foreign trade of that city, restricted and well
nigh prohibited as it has been by the annoy-
ances and disadvantages of the present system
of appraisement at the points beyond the per-
sonal supervision of the western importer, as
will appear by the statement that one of my
constituents paid, in addition to large sums at
home, nearly one hundred thousand dollars at
sea-board cities as duties upon goods imported
by himself; and his case is only a representa-
tive, not an exceptional one.
The following communication from the Com-
missioner of Customs represents that five of
the western ports named in the bill paid for
duties on merchandise imported direct to said
places in the year ending April 30, 1870, the
sum of $3,138,315 14. 1 will read his com-
munication :

There is one other point of material weight
deducible from the report ot' the customs offi-
cer from which I have extracted the foregoing
statement. Such are the disadvantages of the
present system that only such goods as are by
greater bulk, or weight, or minimum value least
liable to damage by or loss from handling, and
most easily appraised, are now shipped through
from the sea-coast under bond. That this may
be more clearly apparent, I will give an analy-
sis of the duties paid at St. Louis for the year
ending December 31, 1S6'>, as furnished from
the oilicial sources, as follows :
Susrars (oloven months only)  £780,229
Ooli'ce  307.103
Kartlienwaro  45,429
Tin  72,775
Railroad iron  215,9iH
I'ig iron  50,637
Manufactured iron   25,148
Cigars  46,-iOl
Total $1,543,781
In other words, eight articles of great bulk
and weight, as compared with value, paid nine
tenths of all the duties collected at that port—
duties in themselves sufficient to warrant all
the expenses contemplated by or in any man-
ner growing out of the operation of this bill,
so far as St. Louis is concerned. Add to these
articles the more costly goods now imported by
St. Louis merchants, such as dry goods, jew-
elry, the more expensive groceries, and even
teas, but the duties upon which are now paid
at sea-board cities only because of the delays
and losses arising from and under the present
law, and the sum total of duties under a liberal
law would be at once more than treble.
It is not necessary, therefore, to conjecture
or estimate with critical accuracy the amount
of transported goods purchased from importers
in eastern cities and sold in the sam'e market.
Such an estimate would be appropriate only as
predicating the future direct trade of the city
with foreign countries, and would bear upon
the_ question under consideration only as ex-
hibiting how much the produce of the Missis-
sippi valley now pays in useless expenditures
beyond the onerous tariff duties imposed by
law, expenditures entailed by a system framed
when the country was in its infancy, when the
great majority of the population was centered
in a few sea-coast cities, and before steam and
electricity, annihilating time and space, had
placed interior, as well as sea-board cities, in
close proximity to foreign markets. As I have
said, sir, this question is of as great, I might
say greater, moment to the people of the val-
ley of the Mississippi as to the merchants and
citizens of the cities named in this bill west of
the Alleghanies. Without depriving the Gov-
ernment of any revenue it reduces the taxes
imposed upon production, and insomuch in-
creases the material wealth of the nation ; and
it is not only as the Representative of a locality
but as a citizen of the nation I ask the passage
of this bill.
Imports.
REMARKS OF 1I0ST.Q. A. EINKELNBUHG,
Oi' MISSOURI,
In 'run House of Representatives,
June 28, 1870,
On the bill (H. It. No, 1538) to regulate appraise-
ment and inspection of imports in certain cases,
and for other purposes.
Mr. FINKELNBURG. Mr. Speaker, the
object of the bill which I have just reported
from the Committee on Commerce is to re-
lieve some of the great importing cities of the
interior, and particularly those of the West,
from the expense, annoyance, and loss occa-
sioned by the detention and appraisement of
imported goods at sea-ports, and especially at
the port of New York.
Tlic bill provides that, subject to certain
regulations and safeguards, imported mer-
chandise may pass in bond from shipboard to
sealed cars and designated vessels, to be trans-
ported iuto the interior under supervision of
revenue officers, and to be delivered at tlieir
final point of destination without detention at
the port of arrival. Under the present anti-
quated system the importing business is gradu-
ally concentrating at New York city, until its
custom-house has become so choked with busi-
ness that it could not do justice to other cities
if it would. The disadvantages under which
merchants in other cities labor are so great
that they prefer to pay tribute to New York,
to the detriment of inland trade and to the
injury of the great body of consumers sup-
plied by such business centers as St. Louis,
Chicago, and Cincinnati. Under the present
system our imported goods are stopped in New
York, carted to a warehouse, opened and han-
dled, thrown into disorder and confusion, and,
as the testimony before our committee showed,
often repacked in so careless a manner as to
render them worthless. But worse than all,
they are detained so long that the time for
their sale frequently passes away before we
can get tbem. We have to fee agents, submit
to petty extortions, and all manner of annoy-
ances.
This bill will relieve us of all this trouble.
The system proposed is by no means a new
thing, it not only exists in all civilized coun-
tries outside of the United States, but it actu-
ally exists in this country at the present time,
for the benefit of our foreign neighbors. By
the act of July 28, 180G, we allow Canadians,
Mexicans, and even the distant Red river
people, to import goods through oar sea-ports,
across our country to their own, under bond,
without appraisement, payment of duties, or
detention at the port of arrival.
Under this law millions of dollars in mer-
chandise pass through our country annually,
