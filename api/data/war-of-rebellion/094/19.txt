several days. The aide who probably penned your dispatch of 30th communicated an order instead of a request. Please accept my sincere congratulations on your succeed at Franklin, and when practicable and convenient inform me of the military situation.

S. P. LEE,

Rear-Admiral, Commanding Mississippi Squadron.

NASHVILLE, TENN., December 2, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Major T. T. ECKERT:

Enemy shows more force on right of our position; seems massing out of reach of guns of forts, on level, open fields, directly west from State House, which is the weakest part of our line. Spies report large force twenty miles down the river, toward Harpeth Shoals, and say rebels propose to cross the Cumberland there as soon as it can be forded or is too low for gun-boats, which will be soon, unless rain falls. General Wood took command of Fourth Cops to-day, in the absence of General Stanley.
