acquire. Cattle upon the hoof will be forwarded to General Hood's army, and corn and breadstuffs are the only articles which your supply train need forward to sustain the army in its march over the barren country between Tennessee River and the Blue Mountain country. Communicate also to Colonel G. W. Brent, assistant adjutant-general, Military Division of the West, Montgomery, all important information which reaches you. This communication is forwarded by the hands of Captain J. McCloskey, one of my aides-de-camp, who will explain to you fully my views on the subject-matters of this letter.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. TAYLOR,

Lieutenant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 27, 1864.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian:

Have telegraphed General Adams, but communication in this way with him I have found unreliable. General Beauregard has taken away all the staff, and I have no one to send toward Blue Mountain. Can you s end a staff officer to investigate the practicability of furnishing supply train by that route?

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 27, 1864.

Lieutenant General R. TAYLOR,

Meridian:

Can obtain, I think, ample transportation to send to Blue Mountain when it becomes necessary. Be good enough to ascertain of Major Dameron, commissary of subsistence, his amount of supplies which may be made available. General Hood is short of ammunition. What number of Enfield cartridges can you spare him?

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI AND EAST LOUISIANA,Jackson, Miss., December 27, 1864.

Brigadier General WIRT ADAMS,

Commanding Central District of Mississippi:

GENERAL: I am instructed by the major-general commanding to inform you that the enemy's cavalry, under Grierson, struck the Mobile and Ohio Railroad late evening before last. He thinks that they will move down the road, destroying it as much as possible., until forced off by troops from below, when they will most probably strike out to the west or southwest, possibly passing through Jackson or Canton. He directs, therefore, that you place all your forces in such a position as to be able to strike them, should this supposition prove correct. In order to keep advised you will send scouts some forty or fifty miles out, in a northeast direction, with courier line to connect them with your headquarters. He wishes you to reach the enemy and punish him as much as possible should he pass within striking distance.

I am, general, respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. ELLIS, JR.,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
