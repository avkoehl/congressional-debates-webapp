KANSAS CITY, October 8, 1864-11 a. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

I believe I can go to Liberty Arsenal without attack. Citizens wish me to stay here, fearing attack. Will you give instructions? If not I shall push on.

CHESTER HARDING, JR.,

Colonel.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

Colonel CHESTER HARDING:

You can judge best as to your progress. Colonel Ford on the lookout from Pleasant Hill. I hope the stores will be brought away from Lexington. I know of no force but Anderson's this side Jefferson City. Anderson was reported as having 500, but you can get telegraphic news as to dangers at Lexington, and act with prudence and your own best judgment.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

Major HILLIARD,

Weston:

Fighting all day yesterday outside of Jefferson; our loss, killed and wounded, not exceeding 40. Fighting ceased about 6 o'clock last night; is expected to proceed to-day. Lines down this morning. Our troops in good spirits and forces moving to strengthen them.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

J. L. THOMPSON,

Assistant Provost-Marshal, Atchison:

Direct ferry-boat to have pilot-house and engine room protected against rifle-balls. I require all boats on the river to do so. Our troops at Jefferson did well up to dark last night. Lexington was threatened by guerrillas yesterday. Lines cut this morning. All the State militia will be called out to meet any emergency.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, October 8, 1864.

CAPTAIN OF STEAMER EMILIE,

Weston:

Have the pilot-house and engine room of your boat well protected against rifle-pits and be on the alert for rebels. I shall require all boats running in my command to do this. Rebels are burning depots east of Sedalia, and an attack is anticipated on that place to-night. Nothing from Jefferson City to day.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
