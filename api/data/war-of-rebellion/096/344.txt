A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, February 1, 1865-12.20 p. m.

Colonel DUANE,Chief Engineer:

I find from report of one of my aides that the new Fort Fisher is in such condition that it completely obstructs the fire of old Fort Fisher, and is not ready for any guns and will not be ready for more than one gun by night; this, notwithstanding my caution of Major Williams to conduct the work in such a manner that it should not be an obstruction to the defense at that point, but that it should not be an obstruction to the defense at that point, but that at least a part of the guns in the old work might be transferred to the front and left flank of the new as soon as supervision and direction of the work by some officer of engineers, if I am not error in supposing that it has been left chiefly to an officer of the Fourth New York Artillery.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, February 1, 1865.

Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS:

GENERAL: An officer of engineers visits the works on new Fort Fisher every day. The masking of the guns at old Fort Fisher is unavoidable.

J. C. DUANE,Major of Engineers and Brevet Colonel, U. S. Army.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS, February 1, 1865-1.20 p.m .

Colonel DUANE,

Chief Engineer:

I must differ from you. The length of time that the new work has obstructed and probably will obstruct the fire of the old might, I believe, have been, and may be, much shortened.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
