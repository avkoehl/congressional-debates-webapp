Near Leary's:

The major-general commanding directs that you hold the two divisions of the Fifth Corps near Leary's prepared to move up to the support of General Burnside, and support him when he calls upon you for support. You will send a staff officer to communicate with General Burnside.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, June 7, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General WARREN,Commanding Fifth Corps:

General Burnside is directed to send some force to Allen's Mill, crossing by Matadequin and the next crossing above, coming from Bosher's.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

JUNE 7, 1864-1 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The map furnished by Major Duane leads you into an error about the crossings of the Matadequin coming from Bosher's toward Allen's Mill. There is but one such crossing and that is at the mill, which I am guarding. They have drawn the stream wrong. All the water runs into Allen's Mill dam and no enemy can cross or get on Burnside's rear unless he comes down from Old Church and then I'll meet him.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.

NOTE.-This note should have gone with Captain Cope.

General HUMPHREYS:

The staff officer I sent to General Burnside has returned. He reports that 3 of General Burnside's skirmishers were driven away from a spot this morning, and that 12 men were then advanced to the same spot. That the enemy has a Whitworth gun firing at very long range; and, secondly, our troops, from the Matadequin Swamp all along, are in two the three lines intrenched, and I believe it is impossible for any force of the enemy to get through them even by the most desperate efforts. Under these circumstances I do not think it likely that we shall be needed for support to this part of the line,
