Lieutenant col. C. GODDARD:

The withdrawal of all the forces on the line of communication and vicinity deprives me of the greater part of my transportation for hauling in forage. Almost all the wagons go with those troops, those for my corps not having arrived. I learn that the wagons and ambulances for the Eleventh Corps left yesterday, and will, I suppose, be five or six days in reaching their destination, as they come loaded. I cannot hear that those for the Twelfth corps have yet left Nashville.

Major-General, Commanding.
