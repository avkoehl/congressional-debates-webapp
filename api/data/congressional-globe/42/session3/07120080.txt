APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 14,
Ho. of Eeps.
Geneva Award—Mr. Butler.
42d Cong....3d Sess.
by the depredations of these cruisers the
losses arising out of the business they were
carrying on to come in pro rata for the bal-
ance.
There arose the question of interest. And
■ the bill provides that interest only from the
date of the award should be paid, because it
is doubtful whether there will be enough to
pay all the interest from the date of the losses,
i he consideration of the interest brings me
to what I will show to the House, and that I
have no doubt everybody is curious to heat-
about: i. e. upon what principle this award
was made up by the august tribunal at Geneva.
We are accustomed to think that so great
and venerable and august a tribunal as that
of Geneva would not act like a common arbi-
tration presided over by a county justice, yet
men are very much alike, however high or
however low their condition in life, however
great or however small their influence, and
eTlde,U0(r * ^old hand is complete
that the high court at Geneva did like every
other board of arbitrators I ever heard of,
just split the difference between the claims
of the parties after they were sifted out
from extraneous matter. That is to say, I
hold in my band, trom the protocols of the
conferences at Geneva, tables finally sub-
mitted by Mr. Staempfli, one of the arbitrators,
in which he puts down, first, the amount
claimed by the American table, $14,437,000:
the allowance by the British table, $7,000,000,
and then takes the mean, $10,905,000, and
after adding and striking out certaiu disputed
elements, says that the round sum of
$>12,000,000 is the amount to be allowed,
lhen he goes into a calculation of interest,
and taking the mean difference, he brings the
matter up to about $17,000,000. Protest was
made against the rate and time of interest by
the British agents, and the interest was finally
adjusted by dividing that so as to bring the
aggregate amount down to $15,500,000. So
that this was not only a lump award, but the
(xeneva arbitrators, like every other arbitra-
tion, arrived at that lump by simply splitting
the difference. They took the amount that
Great Britain was willing to pay and the
amount which the United States claimed, and
throwing out some contested claims, added
the two amounts together and divided by two,
then adding interest. Upon this point I sub-
mit the following, which itself was the base of
compromise:

At the same session, Sir Alexander Coekburn, as
on.f.of.tho arbitrators, presented a memorandum
criticisingtho estimate ofMr. Staempfli, and ho also
presented his own ostimato or table, as follows:
Table in reference to the estimate of Mr. Staempfii.

vised tables   |i4 .(37 143
•Necessary reduction to be made from the
above supposed total:
Double claims $1,682,243

Making the total reduced claim $10,801,324
As against the British estimate of  $7,401,704

Add to this Mr, St.aeuipfli's allowance in
lieu of prospective catch :
One year's wages  $588,000
•Lwenty-five per cent, on the

$10,121,044
Thus it appears that this award is a gross
sum for injuries done to the United .States;
and we have endeavored to divide it as eauita-
tably as we can among those that suffered loss,
but not to those who suffered 110 loss by the war
on the ocean.
Your committee find themselves opposed to
the ideas embraced in the Senate bill as to the
means of ascertaing the amounts of these
losses, &c. ; and upon this point 1 desire the
attention of the House for a moment. The
Senate bill contains a very singular provision
establishing a court of commissioners com-
posed of five judges—they are called judges—
who are to sit here in Washington for one
year; but their term may be extended by presi-
dential proclamation for six mouths longer.
This commission is called a court; in the
Senate bill the commissioners are called
judges ; they are endowed with judicial power;
it is made perjury to swear falsely before
them ; they are invested by the bill with every
attribute of a court of the United States
exeopt the constitutional attribute that judges
of the United States courts shall hold their
office during good behavior. Whether the
Senate calculates that these judges are only to
behave well for one year, 1 do not know.
[Laughter.] But in view of the constitu-
tional provision, I cannot assent to this Senate
tribunal being a court at all. It is simply a
commission to determine the amount of certain
claims, and is given the semblance of a court
without a seal or power to punish for con-
tempt if it should happen to fall into that
estimation in which such commissions usually
find themselves.
Iherefore, though the Senate gravely calls
this tribunal a court, it is in fact a board of
commissioners to sit here in Washington.
Now I am utterly and deeply committed against
any contrivance of this kind. Why? Because
here are $17,000,000 to be distributed ; and as
gentlemen all know from their experience, and
as we have set forth in the report, claims are
as a rule prosecuted before commissions in
Washington upon contingent fees, which are
rarely less than twenty-five per cent., and some-
times more, of the sum recovered, and payable
only on recovery. Hence twenty-five per
cent, of the amount of this award—in other
words, more than $4,000,000—will be dis-
bursed among the claim agents, who, if they
succeed, will get an amount far beyond any-
thing which they could earn by any other
labor during the time they may be engaged iu
the prosecution of these claims. The conse-
quence will be that these four or five million
dollars will form a corruption fund by which
this yearling court (for by the terms of the bill
judges expire at the end of a year) may be
tempted to wrong and injustice. Besides,
there is to be one counsel of the United States
who will be exposed tothe temptation of this
fund, which I repeat is only to be paid the
claim agents if they win, and they can well
afford to give half to win. Henoe I think
that under such a condition of things there is
danger that great wrongs to the Government
und people may be done.
But whether that apprehension be well or
ill-founded, there is another objection going
still deeper. Such a commission must bring
everybody here to Washington to try his case ;
and the expenses would be e.normous, in addi-
tion to the contingent fees, for no lawyer
residing at a distance would leave his home
and come here to try a case at an uncertain
time without much larger compensation than
he would accept at his own home. Then
there must be expenses of bringing books and
witnesses here. Besides, while it may be true
that in large cases counsel living in New York,
Philadelphia, and Boston may come here, yet
iu the great majority of instances it will be
necessary to employ claim agents and local
counsel in this city, who will do their work
under the system which has obtained here, of
fees contingent on success. I say nothing
against the men themselves; I am speaking
of the system.
There is still another objection to a commis-
sion sitting solely in Washington which seems
to me an insuperable one. More than seven
thousand men, seamen and officers, scattered
all over this country, have little claims—claims
for $100, $200, $300; some perhaps as high
as $1,000. These are the seamen and officers
who were sent home or sent to a foreign port
by these cruisers upon their capture. It would
be utter folly, nay madness, for anybody to
come here and prosecute a claim of $100 or
$200, or $500 even; for the amount of the claim
would be consumed in expenses and contingent
fees. Hence under such a provision none of
this most meritorious and most numerous class
of our merchant marine would receive any
benefit of this award if they are required to
come before a commission sitting here and
wait until their turn came before they could
get a hearing of their cause. All this class
of claims would be simply bought up by claim
agents for a trifle or lost altogether to the
sufferers.
Mr. HALE. Let me ask the gentleman a
question and, do it honestly in the pursuit
of light; for I am inclined to favor the pro-
vision sending this matter to the courts. If
it be not sent to the courts, what does the
gentleman believe would be the practical
effect iu cases where there are different owners
residing in different Stales, an owner in Mas-
sachusetts owning one part of a vessel, another
in Maine owning another part, another in New
Yoik owning another part, and a fourth per-
haps owning the cargo, though that would uot
of course come, in the same category with the
vessel?
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I will
come to that, sir.
Mr. HALE. I should like to have the
gentleman explain it.
