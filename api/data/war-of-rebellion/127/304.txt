it. The Legion is to serve wherever it may be ordered by the President, and is to be on precisely the same footing, except as to its peculiar organization, as the rest of the Provisional Army. The cavalry will furnish their own horses and, as far as possible, their own arms and equipments. Each man must have saber and two Colt pistols. Should any horses be lost in the service they will be paid for.

The infantry I wish armed with Enfiled rifles, and the Governor has kindly promised to furnish them as far as he is able to do so, and he will also provide the battery. As soon as the companies report themselves ready for duty they will be ordered into camp for the purpose of drilling together. It is very desirable to have this corps ready at an early day, as I have every reason to hope that it will at once be ordered into active service. I annex a tabular statement, giving the complete organization of the Legion, and one showing the rate of pay. Any one desiring further information on this subject can apply to Lieut. Colonel B. J. Johnson, Charleston, or to myself, at Columbia.
