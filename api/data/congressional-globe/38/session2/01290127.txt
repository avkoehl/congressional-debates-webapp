BILLS INTRODUCED.
Mr. SHERMAN asked, and by unanimous
consent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
375) levying internal duties on tobacco; which
was read twice by its title.
Mr. FOSTER. I will ask the Senator whether
he proposes to have the bill printed. It relates
to a subject which interests the community very
much.
Mr. SHERMAN. I do. I will state further
that the bill was nor prepared by me, but by the
Commissioner of Internal Revenue. 1 desire to
have it printed and referred to the Committee on
Finance.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It will bo so re-
ferred , and the order to print will be made if there
be no objection.
Mr. E)lXON asked, and by unanimous con-
sent obtained, leave to introduce a bill (S. No.
37G) to amend an act entitled "An act to amend
an act to incorporate the inhabitants of the city
of Washington, passed May 15,1820," approved
May 5,3SG4; which was read twice by its title, and

PROCEEDINGS IN CRIMINAL CASES.
On motion of Mr. TRUMBULL, the Senate,
as in Committee of the Whole, resumed the con-
sideration of the bill (S. No. 88) regulating pro-
ceedings in criminal cases, and for other pur-
poses.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The pending
amendment will be read. j
The SncutTARV. The amendment is in line ;
five of section two, to strike out the word "ten"
and insert "five;" so as to make the clause-read:
On a trial for any other offense the defendant shall bo
entitled to five and the United States to two peremptory
challenges.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I should like to inquire
ofthe chairman ofthe Committee on the Judiciary
what is the effect of this amendment.
Mr. TRUMBULL. The effect of the amend-
ment of the committee which is now pending, is to
reduce the number of challenges on the part ofthe
Government allowed by the bill as it was origin-
ally introduced, from ten to five, I think.
There is some diversity of opinion in the dif-
ferent circuits, as the committee were informed,
as to the practice in this respect; and it was
thought better to have it uniform. The bill was
reported at the last session. The Senator from
Maryland [Mr. Johnson] has particular charge
of it, and he can inform the Senator from Indiana
in regard to it, if he desires any information as to
the particular effect of each of the amendments.
I see that the Secretary is under a misappre-
hension; the amendment reported is by way of
substitute for the whole bill. It strikes out the
whole of it and inserts a substitute, and one ofthe
provisions of the substitute makes this change
fiom what the bill was as it was originally intro-
duced. If the Senator from Indiana will send
for a copy of the bill No. 88, he will find that the
amendment reported by the committee is a sub-
stitute for the original bill. I ask that the sub-
stitute be read to the Senate; it will then be better
understood.
Mr. JOHNSON. The chairman is right. The
bill as it was originally introduced consisted of
eighteen sections. The Committee on the Judi-
ciary reported that the whole of that bill should
be stricken out, and as a substitute for it that
there should be inserted all that follows it in the
printed copy from the 6th page onward, printed
in italics, beginning with the words " that from
the persons summoned," &c.
The VICE PRESIDENT. That is the sub-
ject-matter now before the body, and the ques-
tion is on amending thatamendment. The Sena-
tor from Illinois asks that the amendment be again
read. It will be if there be no objection. Does
the Chair understand the Senator as asking that
the entire amendment be read ?
Mr. TRUMBULL. There is but one amend-
ment, wiiich is a substitute for the whole bill.
The VICE PRESIDENT. There is a pend*
ing amendment to that amendment.
Mr. TRUMBULL. It does not appear so on
the printed copy before me.
Mr. JOHNSON. That was an amendment
offered in the Senate.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I was not aware of that.
Then I ask that the amendment to the amendment
be again read.
The Secretary. It is proposed to amend sec-
tion two of the amendment of the committee in
line five, by striking out the word " ten" and in-
serting the word " five;" so that the clause will
read:
On a trial for any other offense the defendant shall be
entitled to five and the United States to two peremptory
challenges.
Mr. HENDRICKS. I desire to ask if that is
an amendment recommended by the committee.
Mr. JOHNSON. No, it is not.
Mr. TRUMBULL. That is an amendment of
which I was not aware. I do not think the com-
mittee reported it, and I shall vote against it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Thepapeis show
that the amendment was offered fay the Senator
fiom New Jersey, [Mr. Ten Eyck.]
Mr. HENDRICKS. I cannot see the propri-
ety of that amendment. I think the original num-
ber proposed by the committee is right enough.
The amendment to the amendment was rejected.
The amendment ofthe committee was agreed to.
The bill was reported to the Senate as amended.
Mr. JOHNSON. As well as 1 recollect, and
the Secretary confirms my recollection in that par-
ticular, I suggested an amendment to the bill as
it came from the committee when it was considered
at the last session. It has not been printed, and
perhaps the Senate are not aware that the printed
bill does not exactly show the bill upon which
they are about to act. I ask that the words which
were inserted on my motion, by general consent
be now read to the Senate.
