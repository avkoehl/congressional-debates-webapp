CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

Corinth, Miss., April 29, 1862.

The commander of the forces [desires you] to hold your corps in condition to meet an apparently impending advance of the enemy. Have three days' cooked subsistence for each man, and ammunition for all arms abundantly supplied as far as practicable. He further desires that the men shall be urgently admonished by their officers of the necessity for complying with orders to fire with deliberation and at the feet of the enemy in any engagement. In the late actions there was a lamentable waste of ammunition. The order concerning infantry detachments must be rigidly enforced.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Brigadier-General and Assistant Adjutant-General.

(To corps commanders.)
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Corinth, Miss., April 29, 1862.

Major-General LEONIDAS POLK,

Commanding First Corps, Army of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: Since my order of this morning information from the front relative to the advance of the enemy on this place requires that General Cheatham and all available troops should remain at this point.

General Maxey will have to act as already instructed, i.e., to stand his ground until he is hard pressed, then fall back on this place, if practicable; otherwise on Bolivar; but the first is preferable.
