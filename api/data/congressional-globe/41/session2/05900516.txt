APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL G-LOBE.
[June 23,
Senate.
Income Tax—Mr. Scott.
41st Cong.,..2d Sess.
posts, the duties, the excises; and second,the
direct, taxes. There is no allusion in any part
of these debates to any otherindirect tax than
the imposts, duties, and excises. There were
only two classes of taxation in the view of the
Convention which formed the Constitution and
of the convention? which adopted the Consti-
tution—directtaxe>, which Judge Marshall said
embraced "lands, slaves, stock of all kinds,
and a few other articles of domestic property,"
and the other the imposts, the duties, and the
excises.
Massachusettssaid this; and South Carolina,
New Hampshire, Virginia, New York, North
Carolina, and lliiode Island all proposed and
asked similar amendments to the Constitution
of .the United States; so that seven States,
more than a majority of all the States, took
this view of the constitutional provision.
Now, Jlr. President, having quoted this his-
torical authority with regard to the question of
whether this is or is not a direct tax, I now
come to another view of it. If it is not a direct
tax, it must be an indirect tax; and all tho
authorities from which I have quoted, wherever
they speak of these two classes of taxes, where
any particular tax is an indirect tax, apply the
rule of uniformity.
In the case of Veazie Bank vs. Feinio, 8
Wallace, 540, Chief Justice Chase having
quoted approvingly the statement of Judge
Patterson in Hylton vs. United States, that
the words "direct taxes," as used in the Con-
stitution, comprehended only capitation taxes
and taxes on land, proceeds:
" It follows necessarily that tho power to tax with-
out apportionment oxtemls to all other objects. Tax en
on oil) er objccts are included umlcr tho heads of taxes
not direct, unties, imposls, and excises, and must bo
laid aiidcoltected by tho rule of uniformity. Tho tax
under consideration isatnxon bankcirculation, and
may vory well be elapsed under tile head of duties."
In Hylton r.i. United States. 3 Dallas, 175,
Judge Chase says:
" 1 think im annual tax on carriages for the eon-
\ eyance of persons may be considered as within tho
power grn.nt.cd to Congress to l;iy duties. Tho term
duly is (liemost comprehensive next to tbcgenorical
lean tax, and practically in tireat Britain (.whence
we take ou-r general idea of taxes, duties, imposts,
excised, customs, &C.) embraces taxes on stamps, tolls
(or passage, &c., unci is not confincd to taxes on im-
portation only."
In the same case, page 17(5, Patterson, J.,
says:
" For tho term tax is tho Bonus, and includes, fast,
direct taxes; second, dtilics, imposts, and excises;
third, all other classes of an indirect kind, and not
"within any of the classifications enumerated under
(he preceding heads. Tho question occurs, how is
such tax to bo laid uniformly and npportionately ?
Tlio rule of uniformity will apply becauso it is an
indirect tax, and dircct taxes only are to bo appor-
(ioncd.''
Mere, then, Mr. President,, we have the opin-
ions of the judges in these cases that where the
tux is not direct, then the rule of apportion-
ment not applying the rule of uniformity must
apply. I am aware it will he answered that
the rule is uniform in regard to this income
tux ; thn.t is, the same rate is assessed all over
the United States. But there must not only
he uniformity in the rate, but there must he
uniformity in the mode of assessment and in
the objects ot taxation and in the results.
I was somewhat surprised to hear the hon-
orable Senator  rom Ohio, in the opening of
this debate, or in the early part of the consid-
eration of this bill, state that if we dropped the
personaliiieometaxand continued the tax upon
corporations the tax ou corporations would be
unconstitutional. Why? If you may tax the
income which a man's body and brains make
out of his profession, after he has spent most
of it in maintaining his wife and children, or
in educating his children at college, if you may
tax the income of the mechanic, the physician,
or tho lawyer, and leave untaxed the million-
aire alongside of him who is owning thousands
of acres of unproductive land, and deducting
from his other incomes the very taxes that he
pays on his productive and unproductive land ;
if you may tax the income of the one and leave
untaxed the income of the other, how is it
that you cannot drop the tax u pon the personal
income and put it upon the income of corpo-
rations ?
Mr. SHERMAN. If my friend wiil allow
me, I did not claim that we had the power to
tax incomes derived from one source and not
from another. I claimed that whatever tax
we imposed upon incomes must be imposed
upon all incomes, whether derived from lands,
salaries, or professional services, and at the
same rates.
Mr. SCOTT. If that be the Senator's posi-
tion, that the tax which is imposed upon in-
comes must be imposed upon all incomes,
where is the authority for beginning with one
or two thousand dollars? You must make it
uniform.
Mr. SHERMAN. I explained the ground
of the exemption, which is applicable to all
citizens and to all sections. That is very
obvious.
Mr. SCOTT. I propose to show that it is
not applicable to all citizens or all sections.
[The hour for a recess having arrived, the
honorable Senator gave way at this point.]
Thursday, June 23, 1370.
The Senate having resumed the consider-
ation of the same subject,
Mr. SCOTT. Mr. President, when inter-
rupted by tlie arrival of the hour for a recess
yesterday I had proceeded so far as to indicate,
lather than to make, an argument against the
constitutionality of the income tax. Passing
from that, 1 had taken up the question of the
uniformity of this income tax, arguing that if
it were not a direct tax, then, being an indi-
rect tax, under the constitutional provision it
should operate with uniformity throughout the
United States.
Pursuing that argument, Mr. President, I
desire now to cull attention to the disparity
that exists in the assessment, and payment of
the income tax in tho several States of the
Union. 1 do not propose to go over them all;
hut I have made a brief table for the purpose
of calling attention to the contrast between the
percentage of income tax paid by a number of
the States and the percentage of real and per-
sonal estate in those Slates, as shown by the
census ot 1860, the last data accessible on that
point. Por the purpose of doing so I have
selected several of the eastern States, joining
with tliem two of the western States and one
of the Pacific States.
I take Massachusetts, New York, Pennsyl-
vania, Ohio, Illinois, California, and New
Jersey, seven States of the Union, and in these
seven States the income tax paid in the year
18G9 was §25,805,597 87. Of that Massachu-
setts paid eleven and eighteen hundredths per
cent., New York paid thirty-one and thirty-
three hundredths per cent., Pennsylvania paid
eleven and seventy one hundredths per cent.,
Ohio paid five and ninety-iive hundredths per-
cent.., Illinois paid six and eighty-four hun-
dredths per cent., California paid three and
seventy-nine hundredths per cent., and New
Jersey paid four and eighty-one hundredths
percent.; making in these States seventy-live
andsixly-one hundredths percent, of the whole
income tax paid in the United States.
The whole amount of income tax paid was
531,220,893 32; and passing from the amount
of income tax thus shown to have been paid;
and the per centage of each State, I proceed to
look at the population and at the real and per-
sonal estate in the same States, and 1 find that
they had in them of real and personal estate
30,810,029,409. Their population wasl3,100,-
£52. The total valuation ot'all the States was
§10,159,010.000, and the total population 31,-
423,442. Thus we have, in the seven States f
have selected for the purpose of illustration
thirty-eight per cent., or about three eighths
of the value, and two fifths or about forty per
cent, of the population. We have it demon-
strated that thirty-eight per cent, of the value
and forty per cent, of the population of the
Union pay seventy-five and sixty-one hun-
dredths per cent, of the income tax. Thus
there is no uniformity upon valuation, upon
population, nor upon representation—the three
vital elements of taxation in a republican coun -
try. I append the tabic:

lotal valuation in all tho States and Territories
in 1860 was $16,159,616,000
iotal population was 31,423,412
I wish it to be borne in mind, too, that tak-
ing the whole internal revenue taxes paid by
the same States, and they are in the following
ratio: Massachusetts, six and forty-eight hun-
dredths per cent.; New York, twenty-four and
ninety-seven hundredths; Pennsylvania, ten
and eighty-one hundredths ; Ohio, eleven and
twenty-six hundredths ; Illinois, nine and thir-
teen hundredths ; California, three and six-
teen hundredths ; New Jersey, two and sixty-
one hundredths ; making sixty-eight per cent,
of ail tho internal revenue taxes that are paid
in the United States. This shows its oper-
ation so far as its uniformity in the States is
concerned.
Now let me come to congressional districts.
I have selected twenty of them. Of these
twenty districts, two in New York pay $3,832,-
899 03; two in Pennsylvania pay $1,709,-
151 2G; onein lllinoispays$l,(58G,G02 75; and
one in Massachusetts, 81,052,788 41. These
six districts in the United States pay $8,281,-
431 45, or very nearly one fourth of the whole
$3-4,000,000 of income tax. Do taxation and
representation go together ? And yet six dis-
tricts out of two lmdred and thirty-three pay
very nearly one fourth of this tax. These
districts are as follows :
Eighth district of New York  S2.457.037 03
