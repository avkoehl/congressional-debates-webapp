Messrs. THOMAS J. DEVINE,

Commissioners on the part of the Convention of the People of Texas.

A note was ordered and sent, inviting the commissioners on the part of the people of Texas to meet the military commission at General Twiggs' office to-morrow morning, February 16, 1861, at 11 o'clock.

Adjourned.

The military commission met pursuant to adjournment, and finding that during the past night the town of San Antonio had been invaded by armed bodies of Texans, who had seized the property belonging to the United States, it was deemed that no further proceedings on the part of the commission would be of any avail, and they therefore respectfully submit their proceedings at this point for the consideration of the major-general commanding the department, and adjourned sine die.

D. H. VINTON,

Major and Quartermaster.
