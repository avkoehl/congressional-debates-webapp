Correspondence relative to Ordnance.

HOLLY SPRINGS, MISS., November 6, 1862.

Colonel J. GORGAS,

Chief of Ordnance, Richmond, Va.:

I need 600 rounds 3-inch Parrott projectiles and 300 rounds 20-pounder Parrott as soon as possible; also small-arms and ammunition; also fixed ammunition, assorted, for field guns. Have none on hand, except what is in the hands of regiments and battalions, only partially supplied.

JACKSON, MISS., November 12, 1862.

Colonel J. GORGAS, Richmond, Va.:

Neither of the Parrott guns, siege guns, 24-pounder howitzers, or 12-pounder bronze guns have been received yet. Have any been sent? I am terribly in want of arm.

The arms sent by messenger on the 29th have never been heard of here. Flats will be sent from Chattanooga as soon as they arrive for 10-inch guns.
