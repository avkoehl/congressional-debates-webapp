All cattle taken out of the country or held in Kansas on any pretend authority from the Indians are stolen cattle, and I would most respectfully request that the commandant of the post of Fort Scott and other military stations in Southern Kansas be notified of these facts, and that stringent measures be taken to stop this wholesale robbery of our already too destitute people, the perpetrators punished, and the property restored to the rightful owners.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. Creek Agent.

You need not come to Leavenworth. Colonel Jennison's case is over. I can send you more cavalry if you want.
