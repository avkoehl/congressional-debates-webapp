Can re-enforce Ringgold if necessary. Ordered scouting parties from Resaca and Dalton in the direction of La Fayette last night, also from Whitesides' for Trenton and Deer Head Cove. Have not heard from them.

General Smith telegraphs from Cartersville that Hood is reported crossing the Coosa, at Coosaville, to-day; that Major-General Sherman, with the Army of the Ohio, is at Cartersville. Colonel Johnson reports from Dalton that rebel cavalry in small squads appearing in that vicinity; says citizens report strong force of rebels between Rome and Dalton; also a force in Lime Creek Valley.

NASHVILLE, TENN., October 10, 1864 - 10. 30 p. m.

(Received 10 a. m. 11th.)

Hon. EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have every reason to believe that Hood has crossed the Coosa River below Rome, and will threaten that place. I am making such disposition of my force as will, I hope, prevent his crossing the Tennessee River, should that be his intention; and while I hold him in the front Sherman will attack him in the rear.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, Commanding.

(Same Lieutenant-General Grant.)
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI, In the Field, Allatoona, October 10, 1864 - 8 a. m.

General G. H. THOMAS,Nashville:

A brigade of the Army of the Tennessee should now be at Eastport up the Tennessee, and a force of 3,000 cavalry is coming across by land. Give such orders as will dispose of Forrest and break his railroad from Tuscumbia back toward Corinth about Brownsvile or Iuka, especially Bear Creek bridge. All recruits should go to the regiments in due proportion, and the new regiments should go to make up a reserve force to hold Tennessee in case we go ahead.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
