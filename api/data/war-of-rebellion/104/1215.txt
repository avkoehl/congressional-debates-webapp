General D. H. MAURY, MOBILE, Ala.:

I can't get along without subterra shell, hand-grenades, more negroes, a company of sappers and miners, a cutter or launch from the navy, two howitzers. The enemy made great progress yesterday and last night in his approaches. He will soon dig up to my main line at the rate he is advancing. Must do something to meet his night approaches.

HEADQUARTERS FORT,April 7, 1865.

Captain SLOCOMB:

The general commanding directs that if you have your mortar in position and guns ready for action, open with your mortars, commencing on your right. Fire leisurely. Throw your shells beyond our lines into the enemy's picket-line. If you think this firing will seriously retard the mounting of 8-inch gun make your statement in whiting. If everything is ready commence now with mortars.
