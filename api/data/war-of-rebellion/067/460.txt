HDQRS. 2nd Brigadier, 2nd DIV., 2nd ARMY CORPS, November 9, 1864.

CAPTAIN: In obedience with instructions from division headquarters, I beg leave to report the operations of the Second Brigade, Second Division, Second Army Corps, while under my command.

Assumed command of the brigade (the known as the Fourth Brigade, Second Division, Second Army Corps) by right of seniority after Colonel M. Murphy, of the Sixty-ninth New York National Guard Artillery, commanding brigade, had been placed hours de combat during the engagement of the morning of the 18th of May. The brigade maintained the position it held when the command devolved on me until ordered to fall back and occupy a line of rifle-pits some distance in our rear. Same evening, moved by the left to the Po River, where we rested till the night of the 20th. While here the brigade was ordered to the right to support Tyler's division. Services not needed; marched for Milford on the night of the 20th of May, which place was reached about 2 p. m. next day. Immediately commenced throwing up breast-works, which occupation was carried on during the night and following day. On the 23d, marched for the North Anna, which was reached same evening. The brigade was formed in line of battle and supported four batteries; during the night advanced in front of the guns and threw up rifle-pits. On the following morning crossed the North Anna, with orders to support (Smyth's) Third Brigade. Colonel Smyth asked for a regiment to hold some works which he had taken from the enemy. Sent him the Sixty-ninth Regiment New York National Guard Artillery; subsequently received an order directing me to give what regiments Colonel Smyth needed. Afterward sent him the One hundred and seventieth New York Volunteers. Was ordered with the balance of the brigade to advance to a rail fence (about 200 yards in our front), tear it down, and construct a temporary rifle-pits. Did so, when I was ordered to move to the right and have the right of the brigade rest on the railroad. During the night threw up breast-works, behind which we remained until the evening of the 26th, when we recrossed the North Anna and occupied the rifle-pits which we constructed before crossing. At this place the Sixty-ninth and One hundred and seventieth reported. On the morning of the 27th marched for Cold Harbor; halted at or near Cedar Grove and threw up breast-works. On the 29th May advanced about 300 or 400 yards, when I was relieved of the command by Brigadier General R. O. Tyler. On the morning of the 3rd of June the command again devolved on me, by Brigadier-General Tyler and Colonel P. A. Porter, of the Eighth New York Heavy Artillery, being put out of the fight, the former having been wounded, the latter killed. In obedience to orders from division headquarters reported for orders, when I was directed to organize the brigade and intrench; did so. On the 4th nothing occurred. On the 5th was relieved of command of the brigade by Colonel Ramsey, of the Eighth New Jersey Volunteers.*
