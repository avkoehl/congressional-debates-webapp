July 14. - Left Camp 5 p. m., with same command and one tank, to make the forty miles to Apache Pass. Road descends into plain from five to six miles, good all seasons of the year; then for seven to eight miles road bad and about two miles of it across an alkali flat covered with water from two to four inches deep, which is very bad; after whichsome hard, level road, followed by succession of hills to Apache Pass Staton, but hard and gravelly, with portions graded; grass scarce, wood plenty, and water to be had by hard fighting.

July 15. - Arrived at Apache Pass Station 12. 30 p. m. About half a mile from station the Apaches attacked the rear of my command, and, I am sorry to add, killed Private, C. M. O'Brien, of Company G, First Infantry, attached to Thompson's battery, who was one of the rear guard, and wounded Andrew Sawyer, teamster, in the thigh; not seriously, however. They, however, met with a arm reception, my men killing four of them. As soon as possible I formed as skirmishers, and after a sharp little contest drove them off, bringing everything in safe except as above stated. On going to the spring for water deployed skirmishers, supported by one of Lieutenant Thompson's guns. Proceeding up the canon cautiously, found the Indians posted high above us, from where they kept up a rattling fire upon us. Called my men out and divided them into two parties of skirmishers, sending them up the hills on either side of the canon, shelling the high points ahead of them. The Indians seemed very loath to let me have water, and fought determinatedly, but they found us too much for them; ut very kept us from the water until after 4 p. m. In the forst engagement for water they killed Private John Barr, of Company E, First Infantry California Volunteers. As soon as I could get water for the horses I dispatched Sergeant Mitchell and the cavalry with an express to Captain Cremony, informing him of the condition of things ahead, and that I would come to meet him as soon as I possibly could with a portion of my command; which part were also attacked, full particulars of which you will find in the report of Captain Cremony to me, herein inclosed. * As soon as I could get water enough for night and morning I withdrew my men, not having enough to hold both the camp and water and go to the relief of Captain Cremony, and as soon as they could get a cup of coffee I started with twenty-eight men and marched back fifteen miles, where I found the train parked and safe. We marched this on my canteen full of water, being all we had, but my men did it without a murmur.

July 16. - Started with train in the morning without breakfast, there being no wood to cook with. Before entering the pass made the following disposition of my force, viz: In front a line of skirmishers; dismounted the cavalry, excepting three, to assist the three men driving the cattle, and distributed them one to each wagon, the cattle immediately behind the train, and in the rear of all another line of skirmishers, and brought everything is safe. Had to repeat the performance of yesterday to obtain water, which I succeeded in doing without losing a man. Dug the spring out so as to increase its capacity fourfold; walled a portion of it and fixed everything as well as I could; put 200 gallons in tank for drinking and cooking, when commenced watering animals, which is rather slow work, as the spring runs but a small stream, and it was late in the night before all the animals were watered. Held the spring until ready to start the next day. Found the graves of privates of First Cavalry, viz, Albert Schmidt, James F. Keith, and Peter Maloney, killed by Apaches June 25, 1865.
