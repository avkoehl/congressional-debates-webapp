APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[February 18,
Ho. of Reps.
America and Japan—Mr. Packard.
42d Cong....3d
ward the star of Empire takes its way." But
it has reached the western limit, the bound
beyond which it cannot pass. And now a star
has arisen in the Bast. Across the broad
Pacific, which is ours as well as theirs, let
us greet its appearing, until our own star of
Empire receives fresh illumination by the
beams that fall upon it from the star in the East.
This is purely an American enterprise;
American in its inception and organization,
American in its management, and American
in its proposed capital. Its officers and
board of directors arc composed of men well
known in the financial world as abundantly
able to consummate this work. They are
among the best, the wealthiest, and most
enterprising men of the eastern States, New
York and New Jersey. They propose to
build, and they will certainly do it, our first
great American line of submarine cable. It is
not creditable to us as a nation that we are so
dependent on foreigners in this matter. Both
Atlantic cables are in foreign hands, and
should a Pacific cable fall under the same
management, we are bound hand and foot to
foreign control. Even our diplomatic corre-
spondence must sustain the scrutiny of foreign
eyes. It is high time this unfortunate con-
dition of things was replaced by a better; and
we have now and here the opportunity to do it.
And at what cost to the Government? Sub-
stantially nothing. This company asks neither
lands, nor bonds, nor scrip for the great enter-
prise. They do not ask us to give them a
charter, that is done by the State of New
York, nor do they ask for the company any
exclusive control of the Pacific coast. They
ask only that they may have a landing for the
cable on our coast, and that at the discretion
and under the orders of the Secretary of the
Navy one or two vessels of the Navy may
assist them in the work. This was done for
the Atlantic lines, done for foreigners, and
surely we will not refuse to our own citizens
what we have done for all others, strangers
and aliens, who have ever asked it.
Such an enterprise is no longer an experi-
ment, except to those who have given some
attention to the subject, it will doubtless be
surprising as well as gratifying to learn the
great extent of the submarine telegraph sys-
tem. It underlies nearly all the waters of the
globe except the Pacific. There are now in
successful operation nearly fifty thousand miles
of submarine cable. I have procured two
tables showing the number of miles of ocean
cable completed prior to 1870, and the number
to be laid down in 1870 and 1871, which I shall
ask to have printed in the Globe in connection
with my remarks.
To conclude, Mr. Speaker, I cannot believe
that Congress will permit this grand oppor-
tunity to pass unimproved. Without cost to
the Government, solely by American genius
and private enterprise, this right royal work
is to be achieved, if we but permit it to be
done. I trust that it will receive from Con-
gress the hearty response which it so richly
merits.
Marry America to China by an electric cord
at the bottom of the sea, and the fruits of the
union will be the extension of our civilization,
the increase of our commerce, the maintenance
of national comity, the diffusion of Christianity,
and the common good of mankind.
