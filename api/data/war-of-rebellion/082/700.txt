JULY 31, 1864.

General MEADE:

In regard to extending my troops to the left as far as the redoubt on the Norfolk road, I would state that I have now Crawford's division in the redoubts on the left and on picket; Griffin's division in a single line with two or three reserve regiments; Cutler's division, one brigade in the front line and one in reserve; Ayres' division, all in reserve. I cannot make my line materially stronger except by the erection of redoubts at intervals along it, but this would take time. I hardly feel that we could hold our line against a strong attack without some reserve, but will try to do so if you think it advisable to send General Ayres' to take position and relieve the division of the Second Corps.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 31, 1864-9.15 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLIAMS:

I have the honor to report that nothing of importance has transpired in my front to-day. I have relieved General Hancock's pickets and placed men in the redoubts. The rest will be relieved early to-morrow morning by daylight or earlier if possible-as soon as my men are relieved.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, FIFTH ARMY CORPS, July 31, 1864.

General WARREN:

I was mistaken in saying Hofmann was out of the trenches. Only a part of his brigade is out, he having relieved Bragg last night. I can, however, relieve the picket-line and occupy the redoubt with Bragg and what there is of Hofmann out of the trenches. Will have the men ready in a very short time.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 31, 1864-1 a. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

It is expected and understood that the troops of the Eighteenth Corps return to their former position. Major-General Burnside will at once return those on his line.

GEO. G. MEADE,Major-General.

(Same to General Ord.)
