HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,March 31, 1865.

General STEVENSON:

You will be required to picket the river to Cat-tail Run, where General Brooke will meet you. The general desires you to send him by next train an official copy of this telegram for his guidance. The principal crossing places are to be picketed with vigilance and frequent patrols between the main posts. With these general directions General Brooke will establish such a system of guards at the river as he may see proper, reporting his arrangements to these headquarters. Colonel Bird will picket the main fords so low as down to the next practicable ford above Back Ford and patrol between his picket posts.

C. H. MORGAN,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
