HEADQUARTERS,Fairfax Court - House, October 14, 1861.

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have been informed be General Beauregard that your have directed him to revoke his orders for the raising of a company to serve a rocket batery. I respectfully ask you to recall your order on this subject, and hope that your permit the company to be raised and equipped in the manner intended by General Beauregard. It is thought by our scientific officers that such a battery would be a powerful auxiliary to our infantry, the more desirable from the great superiority of numbers of the enemy. The weapon would be especially formidable to the numerous but unskIllful horsement of the U. S. Army.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. E. JOHNSTON,

General.

October 14, 1861.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

SIR: I inclose an advertisement which I propose publishing. My object is to get rid of a disaffected and troublesome population, most of whom are idle and would be liable to turn against us if we were in any danger of a defeat. They are sending up to Richmond from day to day and getting passes, thus keeping up a continued communication with the enemy. I propose letting them all go and tell all their tales at once, and after that to allow none to leave. I get it may be submitted to the Secretary of War for his approval or disapproval.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major - General, Commanding.

[Inclosure.]

As many persons residing in this locality are from time to time making application to these headqaurters to be permitted to go North under a flag of truce, and as the time allowed be an act of Congress
