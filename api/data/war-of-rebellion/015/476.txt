At about 5 p.m. I received an order from the colonel commanding the Second Brigade, through you, to move my regiment forward on the road immediately in rear of the Forty-eighth Virginia Regiment, which I at once did, and followed that regiment a short distance up the side of the mountain, where the firing was then going on, when I was directed by the major-general commanding to form my regiment in the hollow across the road leading to the river, and to be governed in my movements by an ambuscade party from the Fifty-second Virginia Regiment,
