Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

A number of recruits for the batteries and regiments organizing were enrolled, uniformed, and in camp prior to April 3, but not mustered. Colonel Simonson refuses to muster any after that date. Will you not allow them to be mustered? They have been put on duty guarding prisoners. What shall be done with incomplete artillery companies and the company for Fifty-ninth Regiment named in Adjutant-General Noble's letter?

O. P. MORTON,

Governor.
