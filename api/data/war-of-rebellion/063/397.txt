LITTLE ROCK, May 2, 1864.

Colonel A. H. RYAN,

Lewisburg, Ark.:

How are matters at Dardanelle? I have it in contemplation to withdraw the force from there to you. The enemy is in large force south of the Arkansas. Have the supplies for Fort Smith, which were landed at Dardanelle, been taken away yet?

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 2, 1864.

Colonel A. H. RYAN,

Dardanelle:

Send all stores intended for Fort Smith to that point without delay. Retain enough Enfield rifles for the detachment without arms, and send the remainder to Fort Smith. Remain in person at Dardanelle. Press the first steam-boat bound down, and be ready to withdraw the Dardanelle force to Lewisburg. Await orders to do so, unless meanwhile you are threatened by too large a force of the enemy. In that event you have authority to withdraw without further orders.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

LITTLE ROCK, ARK., May 2, 1864.

Colonel A. H. RYAN,

Dardanelle, Ark.:

The order to press a boat for the removal of the force from Dardanelle to Lewisburg is hereby countermanded. General Steele arrived here this afternoon. The enemy were successfully repulsed at Jenkins' Ferry on Saturday, and showed no disposition to cross the Saline in pursuit. As Dardanelle is not likely to be threatened by any large force, allow matters there to remain in statu quo, except the forwarding of stores to Fort Smith. You can move personally as you see proper.

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS POST AT BATESVILLE,May 2, 1864.

Captain H. C. FILLEBROWN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Dist. of Northeastern Arkansas:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that everything is quiet at this post. Certain intelligence which I deem perfectly reliable has reached me that about 150 rebels are now encamped on Blue Mountain, waiting for the river to fall, in order that they may be enabled to cross over to this side. I am watching them closely, and constantly patrolling the road up White River. I shall need commissary stores here as soon as they can be sent. I have enough on hand
