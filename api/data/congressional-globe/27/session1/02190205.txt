courtesy in allowing their Treasury note bilis to
pass, ard on various other occasions. He though
it was understood that they wuie to go irto Execu
tive s  smn, and afterwards take up the loan bill.
He shou'd feel it his duty to take measure-* to give
the majority the control of the business, maug'e all
the menaces that had been made. What had been
their course whei mam nonty' When tre chair-
man of the Committee on Finance brought forward
his measures for the ís'ue of Treasury notes, the
necessity oi the Case was pleaded, and in no in-
stance was ¡here n ore than an hour's deoateon the
bilk. Wi h regard to the Treasury no e sys'em,
it was the policy of the last Admmistrst on, while
a loan would be the pohcy of the prc-nt. They
preferred the good old-fashioned mode of doing
business, doubting the expediency of the oihe>, and ,
they had lea on to think that something: like a reci-
procal kindness would ha e been exercised pun-
cilarly whe.i the condi'ion oí the Treasury had
been s ated.
Mr CALHOUN rose to reply.    [Here  it was

year .    But now the warning was given i*- t the

placed on tee olaer branch of Coogitss.    There
never had been a brdy in this or any other country,
m which, for such a length of time, so much d gn ty
and decorum of debate had had been maintained
It was remarkable for the fact, the range of discus-
sion was less arseursive than  ía any other similar
1 ody known.    Speeches were uniformly confined
to ins subject under debate    Th<=r<> cou'd  be no  j

from Kentucky notice to bnog on hi= gas meastie  '
as soon as he pleased.    He womd find it no such ,
easy matter as be ^eemed to think.
The morning hour having expire-1,                       I
Mr LtNN a ked  for a moment to make a few
remarks
Tne, CHAIR ^id it was not in the po \ *r of fie
Chair to % ve leiv?
Mr. LINN sa d he wou'd not occufy more than
a mmue or two.
Tne CHAIR said there was no drcretionary i
power—the usual course was to a^k the leave of I
the Stnate                                                                I
Mr. LINN. Well, sir, I ask the leave of the j
Senate.
Leave was given.
Mr  LINN a id it was an old Scottish proverb, I
that threatened peopla live longest,    H<> booed ihe I.
liberues of the S na e would je' ouili«'f the threats I
of the Senator from Kentucky. But, if ihe I &H was |
to be applied, he woaid ratuer it was  applied at i
once than to be al  ays thrtateied witn it.   Trrre i
¡s great com o'am'of delay, but who was causing
the delay now giowmg out of this threat?    Had n   <
not been made, there woull be no nect-saity lor re-   '
pelling it.   He knew of no disposition on trie part
of his friends to consume the time that ought 10 be '
given to the pub'ic business   He had never known i
his iriends, while in the  majority, to comp'am of '
a scusnon    He knew very well, and could make
allowances, th?t the Senitor fiom Kenmcky was
placed in a v^ry trying situation.    He knew, aV,
that his pdiucil fnends ieit themsehes to be in a
v-ry critical condition.   It  he  brought forward
measures that w re questionable, be had to encoun-
ter resi tance    Bit he was in the predicament in-t
he had pledged himsf U to carry those meassres,
and, if he did not, it wouid be his pel-tied ruin.
He had every th.a,' on the is i-e, hence h s nnpa
'idee to prinjiint"' jad^p er<t a^am t the right of
the minority todisrus   his measures.
r.Ir CLAY nap d theS>rAUr •/ u'd allow h m
to say i^at on no ocoasioa h.td he cff.rcd to pro-
nounce judgment.
Mr LINN said he had nnlers'ocd him to say
that if the Senate was deposed to do as he tnought
it on ht to do, they would adopt the same iuk as-
the oth'r House
Mr CLAY sail, certamlv he meant mat.
Mr. L!NN  aid very well, if the Sena or was in
sudi a critical condition as 10 be obliged to say he

is djing off in the country, and that there is no
time to be los'; unit   he and h.s friends pass
these measures ihey are ruined. All he should
say tc him nas-, p>-s? them if he could If, i<i or-
