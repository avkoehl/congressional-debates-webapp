THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 10,
But the Government was called upon, to be sure,
frequently to make appropriations for repairs, as
individuals were for their buildings arid their pri-
vate works.
Any member of the committee who had any cu-
riosity on the subject, by looking into Document
No. 2, being the report of the Chief Engineer,
would find full and detailed information in regard
to all these works. And the gentleman from Ken-
tucky, if he wished vtill more minute information,
would find it in a report at the session of 1839-MO
of a board of engineer officers, organized for the
purpose of revising a system of internal defence
for the country, which gave minute information of
all the works commenced, completed, and projected.
The only provision in this bill different from the
ordinary appropriation bills, was the second sec-
tion. That proposed to give the President discre-
tionary authority to use the moneys appropriated
any time, at his discretion, immediately after the
passage of the act.
Mr. McK. sent up to the Clerk's table, where it
was read, a letter from the Secretary of War, ex-
plaining the reasons for the necessity of this amend-
ment.
Mr. CLARKE ma.de an inquiry of Mr. McKay,
whether there was an appropriation included in
this bill for Fort Macon, North Carolina?
Mr. McKAY replied that there was not; and
read from a communication of the Chief Engineer,
stating that the works there were in a state of com-
plete efficiency, and needed no appropriation.
Some further conversation took place, and the
suggestion was dropped for the present, no motion
being made.
Mr. McKAY moved an amendment, to come in
after the 79th line, proposing,
"For the armament of fortifications, $300,000."
Gentlemen (he said) need not be startled at the
amount of this amendment. This same item was
usually in the army appropriation bill. It was now
in that bill upon the calendar for the present ses-
sion. He simply proposed to transfer that appro-
priation from that bill to this, in older that it might
have the benefit of the second section, (which he
had explained,) and be expended wherever in the
judgment of the department it was thought proper.
He read from a communication of the Colonel of
Ordnance, showing the propriety and expediency
of the amendment.
Mr. "WENTWORTH didnotwishto place him-
self in an attitude of hostility to this bill even con-
structively, the passage of which be could not
doubt, or he would not interrupt it by saying what
he intended to say. The great importance of the
harbor and river bill, taken m connexion with the
repeated vetoes, had forced him to the conviction
that it was his imperative duty to urge that in pre-
ference to everything else. One session of Congress
had learnt him much, and a second was learning
him more, respecting the diplomacy and art of do-
ing business here. And he would assure new mem-
bers that their only hope of safety for their local
measures was in keeping them ahead of the gene-
ral appropriation bills. There was a class of poli-
ticians in the House who only wanted to pass the
ordinary appropriations, and then adjourn. New
members were apt to think the ordinary appropria-
tions so just ana proper that they almost instinct-
ively gave them the preference over local measures,
and never thought of the consequences until it was
too late.
He wanted the harbor and river bill to come tip
first. And then, if it passed, well enough. But,
if defeated, he wanted to amend the bill before the
House by inserting appropriations for harbors at
some of the more prominent points on the lakes
as the only means of lake defence. He alluded to
the situation of Erie, Cleveland, Chicago, and other
points in case of a war, (a contingency to which
this bill looked,) and inquired how the nation pro-
posed to defend them. If he knew anything of
the sentiments of the people of the lakes—and out
of the whole House, ne was the only member (m
such a way were the districts apportioned) who
travelled their whole length to get here—they would
be satisfied with the perfection of their present har-
bor plans, so that their vessels-of-war could be safe
from the tremendous gales that suddenly swept the
lakes.
[A voice : "And the British."]
No, sir; we are not so much in fear of the Brit-
ish. Give us first-rate harbors to protect us in
storms, and we will take care of the British; and
that, too, without boasting in advance, or after the
job is done. It was as a means of frontier defence,
and the only means, that he was now urging this
measure. He wanted the northwestern members
to look at this bill, and then at the navy bill, and
see how well the southern and eastern sections of
our Union are provided for. Something was due
to the northwest as the only means of defence.
How was that to be obtained ? Only by the pas-
sage of the harbor and river bill.
The chairman of the Committee of "Ways and
Means states that the works in the fortification bill
are old works, and refers to the report of the Sec-
retary of War for the estimates. Mr. W. said that
there was not a river in the bill to which he has
alluded but came also under the head of old works;
: and not one is inserted in the bill which was not
recommended by the Secretary of War. He re-
! ferred to those estimates, as he also did to the esti-
mates for harbors. He went back to the days
; of Monroe, when the appropriations were first
; made, and traced them down through the Admin-
! istrations of A-dams, Jackson, Van Buren, and
j Tyler; and he would submit every appropriation
in rhe bill to the test of General Jackson in the
Wabash, and also in the Maysville road veto.
This bill, he noticed, was styled a foitification
bill. This might be the case; but he could not
' consent to us being culled a general fortification
: hill, as the lake country was not provided for.
j lie knew that many members were opposed to the
; harbor and livei bill, because they believed it pro-
! viduig for a wild and unlimited system of internal
! improvements. But the improvements were no
: more internal than those provided for in the bill
now under discussion; and he could not under-
stand how that southern improvements were con-
sidered external, and therefore constitutional,
whilst northern ones were internal, and therefore
unconstitutional, and that, too, when the South
wt)s thousands of miles from a foreign power, and
the North directly under its batteries.
Mr. W. never went home without going in sight
of the British red coats, and through narrow pass-
es where shot and cannon could easily be aimed at
objects from one shore to the other; and yet mem-
bers talked about lake harbors, as if they were in-
ternal improvements. In case of war, if we ex-
pect to take and keep exclusive possession of the
lakes, we must have harbors where we can build
and shelter our vessels. And in such a light, Air.
W. did insist that the lake harbors were entitled to
the immediate consideration of the House.
The chairman of the Committee of Ways and
Means had said that if this bill passed early, Gov-
ernment could go directly at the work. The same
reasoning applied to lake harbors. Pass the bill
now, and much can be done towards expediting
the work by the opening of navigation in the
spring. It will be remembered that the appropri-
ation of last year was lost, and a great deal of
damage was done thereby to the works in an un-
finished state. Hence the greater importance of
an early appropriation.
Mr. VV. alluded to the opposition among a cer-
tain class of politicians at the northeast to lake
harbors, on the giound of internal improvement.
Mr. W. called up the subject of the fishing boun-
ties on the Atlantic coast. He had statistics in his
luuid, showing that—
Maine had over   ^2,000,000
New Hampshire over 406,000
Massachusetts 7,500,000
Ilhode Island    .434,000
Connecticut 213,000
New York 1,471,000
And whilst eastern sailors got all this advantage,
there were some members from the cast who would
not give the sailors upon the lakes a single harbor
m which to shelter themselves in a storm. Boun-
ties western sailors did not ask; and yet they paid
no small share of those given to the sailors at the
East—he would not here say undeservedly, be-
cause ho did not believe in detracting from one sec-
tion for the benefit of another; but this he would
say, he loved a sailor wherever lie found him; and
fi'i ther would add, both for the benefit of the lake
and the Atlantic sailors, that there was no class of
men that worked so hard and risked so much for
so little pay. fie said there were seven States and
one Territory bordering the lakes. How much
they paid for the benefit of other sections through
the tariff, he would not say; but here were the
proceeds of the sales of the public lands:
Ohio $23,136,736 16
Indiana  ..19,649,154 49
Illinois 17,230,379 40
Michigan 11,674,860 96
Wisconsin ; .3,641,785 54
#75,332,916 55
Of this, no less than the following amount was
paid the past year:
Ohio $188,711 28
Indiana   . 116,656 39
Illinois 508,896 01
Michigan   26,795 26
Wisconsin   ...455,651 46
§1,368,710 40
Now, the whole harbor and river bill (eastern
and western) does not amount to but $1,348,000;
not quite $£600,000 of which is for lake harbors.
The whole amount for lake harbors ever grant-
ed is but #2,800,000. This is less than the esti-
mate for the completion of the Delaware break-
water; but little more than the Norfolk harbor, Vir-
ginia; and but the same as the fishing bounties to
the single States of Maine, New Hampshire, and
Rhode Island.
This neglect, Mr. W. hoped wotffd continue no
longer. Numerically speaking, the lakes were
weak on this floor. But few members ever saw
the lakes, and surprisingly few represented any
portion of the five thousand miles of lake coast.
In his State he was the only member that lived
oil the lakes, or travelled them. The lake mem-
ber from Indiana was also solitary and alone.
The most of the lake members came here for the
first time at the present session; and, save the
gentleman from the Cleveland district, Ohio, [Mr.
Giddi^gs,] not a member from the lake coast re-
gion had yet served out his second term. Few and
inexperienced, they had both numbers and very
long experience to contend against.
Mr. W. was deeply sensible of the disparity,
and could only rely upon the justice of his cause.
He said during the last year there were 60 lives
lost, 36 vessels driven ashore, 20 total wrecks, 4
sunk, at a damage of $200,000; in the last five
years, 400 lives lost, ana $1,000,000, exclusive of
fines and appropriations.
He said the lake commerce was more extensive
than would be supposed from the very small num-
ber of lake representatives on this floor.
In 1845, there were 17 vessels of 4,598 tons,
built on Lake Ontario; and between Buffalo and
Chicago, 48 vessels of 10,207 tons: in all the lakes,
save Champlain, 65 vessels of 15,000 tons, costing
|850,000. In the last five years, were built above
Niagara Falls 180 vessels, costing $2,500,000. Of
these, 31 were steamboats, and 4 propellers. In
the whole lake trade, Mr. W. estimated 60 steam-
boats, 20 propellers, 50 brigs, 270 schooners; ma-
king 400 vessels of 80,000 tons; costing $4,000,000.
There are now building on the stocks between
Chicago and Buffalo, 10 steamboats, 12propellers,
and 12 sail vessels—34 m all. There are 6,000 ac-
tive seamen on these lakes, and their commerce the
past season has been all of #125,000,000.
Mr. W. gave the following statement, which he
believed correct, of the amour t of revenue collect-
ed for the two fiscal years, running from 1st of
July, 1843, to 30th of June, 1845, at all the ports
of entry on the northern lakes, and the amount
collectcd each year at each port:
Port of Entry.
Amount collected
from July 1,1843,
to June 30, 1844.
