forgot to mention that I pressed 4 horses from citizens, to bring my men and prisoners home on, and which I returned. I also gave receipt for all forage, with my name signed. I was compelled to feed on one Union man (Mr. Mahew), near Scottsville, the first night out. He accompanied me to Bowling Green, and I hope the proper vouchers will be given him for his grain. He is true man, and had two sons in our army, one being killed at Shiloh. They were members of the Ninth Kentucky Infantry.

Yours, respectfully,

S. P. LOVE,

I gather from the prisoners captured, and from other sources, that there are six or seven regiments of infantry on Duck River, near Chapel Hill.
