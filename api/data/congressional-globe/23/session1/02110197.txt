not been appended, it was a sufficient reason for
presenting the German copy with the other
Mr MUHLENBERG had no objection to it,
and should comply with the request. He also
stated that he had no objection to the printing of
the names
Mr WATMOCJGH demanded the yeas and
nays on his motion, and they were ordered
Mr TURR1LL objected to printing names to
this or any similar memorial It was time to put
a stop to this kind of operation We had already
printed half the names in Philadelphia at the
public expense What was the object' Not to
enlighten the membeis of this House m regard to
this question Any one who wished to see what
weight was attached to the names could go and
read them in the Clerk's office, without diawing
any money from the Treasury In the first place,
the bank gets up its panic meetings, and then they
come and ask us to pay the expen&es of printing
and circulating their proceedings, memorials, and
even the signatures He could see no possible
benefit to result fiom printing the names If gen-
tlemen who advocate the printing would gne a
reason for it, he would then withdraw his objec
tion
Mi MILLER was indifferent whether the names
were printed or not But he was at a loss to im-
agine why this system of cateclysingmembers was
introduced His colleague had slated expressly
that the memorialists v, ere many of them highly
respectable men The effect that the memorial
was intended to have could be seen by any one
He believed himself that it was impossible to draw
adistmction between the question of a restoration
of the deposites and a recharlei of the bank Who
could doubt that the restoration would produce a
rechaiter' And he hod understood his colleague,
[Mr Binney,] with Ins accustomed frankness, to
avow the opinion that unless the bank was íechar-
tered the restoration of the deposites would be of
no avail In iegard to the duplicate memorial we
were contending about, they were both the same,
and it was of no consequence which was presented
to the House
Mr McKENNAN contended that the restora-
tion of the deposites was notnecessanly connected
with the question of the rechaiter ot the bank
But gentlemen (said he) had connected the ques-
tion with a view to excuse their course to their
constituents
Mr BINNEY made a few remarks in reply to
Mr  Moler
Mr SUTHERLAND said it was rather strange
so much should have been made upon so small a
matter His colleague did throw out an idea that
there was something nibidioue—owing to some
m sappiehension m the signer-—in the manner by
which some nameb weie withdiawn from this pe
tition Generally speaking, he wished gentlemen
to consider the propriety of having names punted
to the memorial as calculated to do little good ex-
cept to benefit the public printer Although there
are many persons who signed this and other me
moríais from Pennsylvania, they were the steady
friends of the Administration, but who thought
that m this matter a mistake 01 erroi had been
committed by General Jackson, foi whom they
did not claim absolute infallibility, or that he was
more than man He wished that the names would
be punted, that it could be hereaftei seen they
■would be found again, as they always had been,
ardently supporting the principles of the Republi-
can party
Mr McKENNAN congratu'ated his colleague
for the motive he had avowed that he was actuated
in desiring the names of the memorialists to be
printed He thought that they were men of whom
any country should be proud, inasmuch as they
showed that they could dare to act up to their
opinion in opposition to the Administration, even
li it were only on one solitary point
Mr MUHLENBERG said there was some
misapprehension as to what had fallen from him
lie had not objected to the printing of the names
of the memorialists He, howevei, would state,
that he held a letter in his hand, signed by nine-
teen persons, whose signatuies weie affixed to thib
memorial, in which they expressly state that they
had been induced to sign it from some misconcep
tion of its purport, and they had authorized him
to state so to the House.
Mr WATMOUGH withdrew his call for the
yeas and nays
Mr MANN, of New York, wished to know
whether the printing was to be in Dutch, that there
might be no cheateiy
The SPEAKER said he had announced his in-
tention of having the memorial printed in the
Dutch
The question being stated on the printing of
the names to the memorial—
Mr WATMOUGH a second time called for
the yeas and nays, and they were ordered.
Mr FELDER remarked that, as the signatures
were in both languages, there would be some in-
justice in printing them twice over
Mr MERCER said that the value of the time
engaged in the discussion would suffice to pay the
expense of printing
Mr TURRILL v/ould oppose, if he stood alone,
the printing of all such petitions It was surpriz-
ing to him to hear such an unnecessary expense
advocated There was, among others, a petition
aheady punted on this subject, with sixty two
pages of names at a considerable expense These
petitions, he believed, were got up originally by
the bank, and those who procured the signatures
were paid for then trouble out of Mr Biddle's
breeches pocket He felt that it was time for the
House to take a stand and save the Treasury from
this expense which was sought to be thrown upon
it It was possible that many of those who signed
the petitions from the large cities, were stimulated
by the «issuances that then names yvould appeal m
a j  inled book
Mr H EVERETT did not think the mem-
ber from New York [Mr Turuill] warranted in
taking forgranted thatallthe memonaL presented
on account of distress, were got u,i by the bank,
and he desned to know if it was the des gn of
gentlemen, by making such statements, to foiestall
public opinion and thus pre\ent them coming for-
waid to testify their deep sense of that distiess
If such denunciations were made it must have the
effect of (leteirmg, in future, any petitions being
sent He hoped tint tne Repiesertatives would
not consider themselves so much the repiesema
tives of any par icu'ai distnct, as of the whole
people, and that, wnen pet tions should be pre-
sented, that they would be Heated by membeis in
a respectful manner Fhey should look Jo consid-
erations affecting ihe g neial good, ai d ought to
be above those of party
Mr BURGES was astonished at the opposition
giver to the printing of the names tq memormls on
the ground of e\pense, and he advocated it as ne-
cessaiy to establish, beyond question, whetherthe
distress which now agitated the country was real
or pretended—was got up by the people them-
selves, or by the influence, as charged, of the
bank
Mr LANE believed that the statements they
had heard thit these memorials about distress
were got up by the bark, were jjstly founded
They had been known to originate almost at the
doors of the bank, and only fi om those p'aces di-
íectly under its influence There was no voice of
distress from li diana 01 Illinois
Mr EW1NG corrobora ed the statement that
there was no distiess felt in Indiana, and he
maintained that there was a general feeling that
the people should ha\e some benefit from the
profits, denved fiom the bank, that they thought
these profits should not be monopolized by any
institution which propei ly belonged to themselves
As other memorials had been printed, he would
vote for the printing of this, in both Geiman and
English
Mr CROCKETT ro-e and said Sir, as I am
the only person from Tennessee in this House who
am opposed to the Administration, I hope I may
get a few words in, that I may say what are my
own notions on these matteis Sir, I think the
member from New Yoik, ['Mr Tirrhx,] who has
just spoke, has been a little testy in his objections
He talks much about this, as if it was a great
matter Sir, are we to stick at such trifles as a few
dollars in the printing a matter so important? It
seems, sir, to me to be something like loading a
twenty four-pounder to shoot a flea Sir, is it not
so' We are spending three or four thousand
dollars in discussing the printing of a matter that,
perhaps, after all, will not be twenty cost    But,
sir, this is retrenchment, but it is the old rule for
retrenching I love.sir, tosee the petitioners come
here, and my life on it, sir, they will come; aye,
and fiom Indiana, for all that we hear to the con-
trary, and yet from my own State eveiy day my
letters tell me they wish this question settled.
They know very well in my distnct the character
of the man who, when he takes anything into
his head, will carry it into effect They know-
how I should act in this bank business, for I told
them, before I was elected, how I should vote—
that I would recharter the bank, and restore the
deposites Sir, I get letters every day, from all
parts, which tell me these acts are disapprobated
The question is now, whether we shall be under
the old and happy state of things, or have a despot.
Sir, the people have a right to tell their grievances;
and, sir, I tell you, they must not be refused—I
can't stand it any longer—1 won't
Mr ASHLEY, of Missouri, said that he could
not undertake to state, with any degree of pre-
cision, how the people of Missouri were divided
on the important question of the removal of the
deposites, nor could he account for not having
received memorials from his constituents on that
subject. Perhaps the people of Missouri have
come to theconclusion that memorials,petitions,or
prayers of any kind touching this subject would
avail nothing, that should they be favorably dis-
posed of by Congress, they might be disregarded
in another quartei Mr A. thought the people
of Micsouu as deeply interested in this measure
as those of any other portion of the Union The
State had been a few years ago literally inundated
with local bank paper, when everything in rela-
tion to" the currency of the countiy was confusion
and distrust On the introduction of the paper of
the Bank of the United States this unsound and
fraudulent currency (local bank paper) gradually
diminished, and at length entirely disappeared
Since that time up to the present everything in
relation to the currency of the country has moved
on smoothly, but he feaied, from pi «sent appear-
ance, this state of things would not long exist
Mr LANE made some explanations in reply
to his colleague, [Mr  Ewing ]
The question was then taken on the motion
to punt the names signed to the memorial, and
decided in the affirmative—yeas 112, noea 90.
On motion of Mr THOMAS,
The House then adjourned
