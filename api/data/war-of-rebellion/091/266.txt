WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, October 3, 1864-11.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

My intelligence from telegraphic operators is that the Front Royal road is very little broken, and might be put in running order before Sheridan can get his Sixth and Nineteenth Corps there, say in three days. With a rapid accumulation of rolling-stock of the Government and Baltimore road, they could be moved at once to Alexandria, and, with and adequate supply of water transportation, reach you by Saturday morning, if you conclude to adopt Sheridan's suggestion of sending them to you.

E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
