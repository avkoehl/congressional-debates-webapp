CUMBERLAND, July 3, 1864.

Captain PETRIE,

Sir John's Run:

You will be governed by the information you may receive. If you think it not too hazardous you will run down to Sleepy Creek or Cherry Run in the morning and return to Sir John's Run and report by telegraph for orders. General Sigel retreated from Martinsburg to-day at 11 o'clock without much loss.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel THOMPSON,

The enemy are reported in force at Winchester. Send a scout of twenty-five men, in command of a reliable officer, to Romney this a. m. and ascertain if there is any movement this way. If there is another operator at Green Spring I desire Frank Miller to go with the scout.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.

Direct an officer of the infantry company at your place to go to South Branch and advise the officer in command there of your information, and also direct him to send the same messages to Little Cacapon, and direct the men to occupy the block-houses and defend them to the last if attacked.
