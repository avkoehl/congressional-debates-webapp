Major-General HUMPHREYS,Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to forward the following dispatches:

PLANK ROAD-12.25 p.m.

A column of infantry moved out of Petersburg at 1 p.m., coming toward their right in the rear of Cemetery Hill. It was upon the same road upon which the column moved into the city at 11.40 this morning and numbered about as many men, but was moving in the opposite direction. I think it to be the same body of troops. Since then one regiment moved into the city and shortly afterward a similar number returned toward their right, passing out of sight in rear of Cemetery Hill.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. F. FISHER,

Major and Chief Signal Officer.

STATION NEAR GIBBON'S HOUSE, September 29, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Major B. F. FISHER:

I have reported column of troops moving toward rear of Cemetery Hill. It moving on same road as column while you were here, but in precisely opposite direction. It is about same size column as one you saw moving to right and I think it is the same, since one regiment has moved into town to right, and soon after same, or similar, returned over same road to left.
