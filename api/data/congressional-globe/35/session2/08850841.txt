therefore, that, by common consent, the title be

reconsider the vote yhereby the title was adopted.

The vote was reconsidered.
Mr. BENNETT. I move to amend the title

P. S. DUVAL AND COMPANY. |
Mr. FLOPÂ«,ENCE. I rise to a privileged qucs- j
tion. I move to reconsider the vote by which j
Senate bill No. 331, for the relief of P. S. Duval
& Co., was laid on the table. If the House does
not care to occupy its time with the consideration
of the matter now, 1 am willing that the motion
shall go over untihnext Friday. I think the House
passed over the bill yesterday without that sort
of examination which it ought to have. I do not
care, however, to take up time with it now; but
if the House shall insist on the consideration of
the motion at this time, I propose to submit a few-
remarks in explanation of the bill.
The SPEAKER. No debate would be in order
upon a motion to reconsider a vote laying a bill
on the table.
Mr. FLORENCE. Then I hop^he motion 1
will go over for the present.
The SPEAKER. The consideration of the j
motion will go over for the present, if no objec- |
tion be made. |
Mr. MORGAN. I object; and move to lay the |
motion to reconsider on the table. ;
Mr. FLORENCE. 1 hope the House,by unan- j
imous consent, will allow the report in the case !
to be read. j
Mr. LEITER. I object.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Was not this bill t
yesterday reported from the Committee of the ;
Whole House, with a recommendation that it do j
not pass? |
The SPEAKER. It was. ;
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. And but for that !
recommendation it could not have been reported j
at all. ;
The SPEAKER. No debate is in order.
The motion to lay on the table the motion to
reconsider was agreed to.
GENERAL LA PAYETTE.
Mr. SANDIDGE. I rise to a privileged ques-
tion. I *nove to reconsider the vote by which the
bill of the Senate (No. 71) to amend an act en-
titled " An act to authorize the relocation of land
warrants Nos. 3, 4, and 5, granted by Congress
to General La Fayette," approved February 2fi,
1845, was passed yesterday.
The SPEAKER. The Chair is informed that
a motion waS yesterday made to reconsider the
vote by which the bill referred -to by the gentle-'
man was passed, and that motion was laid on the
table.
