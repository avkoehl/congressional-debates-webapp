Carolina to withdraw that motion, to enable me

pone it, 1 am opposed to postponing it from day
to day. Let it go over till Monday next.
Mr. FLORENCE. Very well; I have no ob-
jection. I accept the amendment.
Mr. FARNSWORTH. I wish to move an
amendment to that. I hope this question will not
be kept before the House every Monday—a day
that ought to be devoted to the introduction of bills
and resolutions. I therefore move an amendment

first Monday in June next. [Cries of "Agreed'''
