THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 25,
that bill to increase the pay of the volunteers to
ten dollars per month. He voted against this in-
crease, not because he was opposed to a general
•increase, but because he was compelled to vote on
the proposition without any means of amendment;
and he thought, to increase the pay of the volun-
teer, and not that of the regular soldier, was un-
equal, unjust, and, if you please, undemocratic.
He thought he voted right then, and would vote
in the same way again. At the succeeding session,
the idea of increasing the pay of the volunteers
alone was abandoned on all sides of this Hall', and
lie then voted to increase the pay of the whole
armv in accordance with the principles he had al-
ways advocated. The Senate, however, disagreed
to the increase, and the compromise between the
two Houses resulted in the bounties provided in
the ninth section of the law which is proposed to
be amended. Though this line of conduct was so
clearly right and proper on his part, yet there were
riot wanting those who endeavored to place him in
a false attitude before the country, and excite pre-
judice in the public mind, when none dared to avow
their disapproval of his principles. This agitation
had led him into an examination of the past histo-
ry of the legislation of the country on this subject.
At no time has any complaint been made as to the
compensation of the officers. On all hands it is
considered most ample; and in consideration of the
pay of the private, the inequality has been most
striking, an"8 not in accordance with the spirit and
genius of our institutions. Heretofore both the
profit and the honor have been theirs. And, although
our army had been better paid and better fed and
clothed than any army of the world, yet their pay
had been insufficient and inadequate. In the year-
1785, before the adoption of our present Constitu-
tion, a law was passed allowing the privates m the
ranks of the regular army four dollars per month.
September 29,1789, the militia and volunteers were
allowed the same compensation. By the law of
April 30,1790, this allowance suffered a reduction,
and was brought down to the petty amount of three
dollars; and even from this, ninety cents were de-
ducted for his clothing, and ten cents more for
medical stores: so that his actual pay was but two
dollars a month. March3, ]79U,themilitiaand vol-
unteers were put upon the samefooting. In 1792, a
- slight change was made for the benefit of the non-
commissioned officers. January ;i, 1795, the pay of
the militia and volunteers, while engaged in the ser-
vice of the United States, was increased to $6 66.
March 3,1795, the pay of the regular army was in-
creased to §4 per month, with a bounty of §16 on en-
listment. July 16,1798, the pay of the regular army
■was increased to §5per month,and allowed a boun-
ty of $12. This was the pay of the soldiers in the
olden time—under the old regime. And thus it con-
tinued tillthe late war with Great Britain. This war
was declared by Congress, June 18,1812. But pre-
vious to this declaration, laws for the increase of
the army of the United States, raising volunteers,
and calling out the militia, were passed, December
24, 1811, January 11,1812, and February 6,1812.
But six months after the declaration of war, De-
cember 12, 1812, a law was passed increasing the
pay of the regular army to $8 per month, allow-
ing a bounty of §16 upon enlistment, and, when
discharged, three months' extra pay and 160 acres
of land. February 2,1813, the pay of the regular
army was#extended to the militia and volunteers,
excluding them from the bounty upon entering the
service, the extra pay, and the 160 acres of land
when discharged. This disparity continued durin°-
the whole war—a discrimination operating heavily
and un justly against the volunteers and the militia.
The war being ended, and the volunteers disband-
ed, and a return made to a peace establishment,
March 3, 1815, the pay of the regular army was
reduced to the rates established by the law of
1798, and the militia and volunteers to those of the
law of 1795. March 21, 1833, the pay of the pri-
vates of the regular army was increased to §7 per
month. March 19, 1836, some time after the com-
mencement of hostilities with the Florida Indians
the pay of the militia was increased, and they
were put upon the same footing as the regular
troops, except as to clothing. In 1838, during the
existence of the Indian hostilities, there was some
singular legislation; July 5, 1838, the pay of the
privates of the whole aimy was increased to $8
per month, $24 was allowed for a reenlistment, and a
bounty of 160 acres of land allowed; but July7,1838,
two days afterwards, the increase of pay and bounty
pealed. Thus the pay stood when ' under consideration, the following review of the
provision were re_
the Mexican war began. In all our legislation du-
ring this period, we have maintained an equality
between the regular soldier and the volunteer, with
these exceptions: a small bounty has been allowed
the regular soldier on enlistment; and the volun-
teer-was allowed $3 50 per month for clothing,
while the regular troops receive §2 50 per month;
and the volunteer receives 50 cents per twenty
miles while travelling, and the regular soldiers
about 15 cents.
This equality in compensation had been ap-
proved, in his estimation, by the country; and the
statement made must satisfy every member of this
committee that it is our duty to smooth the path
of the old soldier to the grave, and, as far as it
may be just and in accordance with established
precedents—though too late to reach the case of
many who have fallen asleep—to do now what
ought to have been done long ago 
Mr. VINTON interposed, and asked what num-
ber would be entitled to land under the amendment
now offered.
Mr. THOMPSON continued, and said, he had
expected this point would be raised by those who
act upon the principle that justice was to be deter-
mined by the amount required to satisfy its demands.
He had examined the public records, and obtained \
all the information that cou-ld be gleaned from the j
published documents and from the departments. I
The facts, as far as ascertained, were as follows: I
The number of men who served for twelve months, i
was 6,890; the number that served for six months, I
60,375 men. By reference to document No. 20, |
2d session, 24th Congress, all the members of j
the committee may find a full statement. If we j
allow one hundred ami sixty acres of land to each !
twelve-months' man, the amount of land that will !
be absorbed is 1,102,400 acrcs; 80 acres for each
six-months' man, will amount to 4,830,000. The {
whole amount will be 5,932,400 acres. Now, it }
must be remembered, that those soldiers of the last i
war who served for five years or during the war, I
have already received their bounty. But there were ;
some four thousand soldiers of the regular army 1
who did not enlist for either of the above terms,
and who would be entitled to land, having served /
either twelve or eighteen months; and these will \\
require 640,000 acres of laud to satisfy their
claims. AHd tiie estimate may be safely made, that !
6,500,000 acres will be most ample to meet every
claim, on the supposition that every mart appears ,
and claims the bounty which a liberal Congiess j!
bestows upon him; and this is, in itself, most lm-
probable. The following is the number from each ;!

Now, in a review of the legislation of Conf^
on this subject of bounty la„d, it will be found that
a reservation of six millions of acres of the public
domain had been set apart for the purpose of satis-
fying the warrants issued in favor of the soldiers
of the last war. The reservation was located in
the States of Illinois, Missouri, and Arkansas.
x>ut as this whole subject of bounty land
The locations of the warrants granted to the Canadian vol-
unteers were confined, under the act of 18J6, to the then
territory of Indiana, and undrr the subsequent act of 1817
" to such lands as have been offered at public sale according
to law, and no other hence thev did not interfere with the
six millions of acres of land originally appropriated in Illi-
nois, Missouri, and Arkansas, for the purpose of satisfying
those warrants which have issued pursuant to the acts of
December 11,1811, January and February, J812, and Decem-
ber, 1814.
Thus it will appear that of the six millions of acres
reserved for the purpose of satisfying the military
warrants issued for services in the late war, nearly
one million two hundred thousand acres still re-
main unlocated.^ And thus, he verily believed, it
would turn out in the present instance: thatthough
the calculation would lead us to suppose that six
millions of acres would be required to satisfy the
claim, yet not more than three millions of acres
would ever be located.
Having ascertained the extent of the claim, the
; next question arises as to our means of payment.
! At this time he would be reluctant to increase the
j public debt; and though the claim be just, yet as
I those who had gone before us had neglected to pro-
| vide for it, it peihaps may not be criminal in us to
; pass it by. But he hod examined into this matter
j also; and in the State of Mississippi, at this time,
1 there'were more than eleven millions of acres of
j land subject to entry at private sale. He would he
I glad if the whole number of warrants which might
I be issued could be located in that State; all of them
,9^2,400 , would be satisfied, and still a sufficient amount
| would be left to answer all the purposes of specu-
■ lation. His constituents would welcome the old
I soldier or any of his children among them with a
| right hearty good will, and perform for him all the
: offices of good neighborhood. The last returns
show, we have now belonging to the United States
I 146,603,063 acres of land subject to private entry,
j A large proportion of this land has been open for
is now li sale and entry for more than twenty years; and
