Major- General BUTLER,

Fort Monroe:

General Meade is at Philadelphia sick. Your telegram has been referred to the General- in- Chief:

Dispatch from Brigadier- General Palmer, received at 1 p. m. to- day, says his outposts are attacked and driven in by a force which he thinks to be 15,000 men; I suppose it to be 8,000; two regiments [from each division] of Lee's army having been sent down to North Carolina. I got the information reliably yesterday. I have sent a regiment to re- enforce Colonel Jourdan at Morehead City. Now is the time, if ever, for General Meade to move; the roads are practicable. That will relieve North Carolina at once and leave a movement for me of which I spoke to you.
