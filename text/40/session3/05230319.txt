1869.
THE CONGRESSIONAL OLOiBE.
tleman whether it would not,be well to limit
this resolution, if it is to be pas,sed at all, by
adding words to the proviso. It was deemed
important by the Committee on Foreign Af-
iaiis to so restrict the action of the President
under this resoluiion as that no action should
bi' taken which should involve the appropria-
tion of money withoutfirst consulting the Con-
gress of the United States. Would it not be
well enough to add further words to that pro-
viso? I would suggest the addition of these
words:
And that 110 action shall he taken by tho Executive
of flic United States without first consulting and ob-
taining theconsent ot Congress thereunto, which can
by any possibility involvo this country in a conflict
of arms.
Mr. BANKS. I would cheerfully accept of
such an amendment, but I am not authorized
to do so myself, this being a report of a com-
mittee. Bat ] do not object to su.ch an amend-
ment. We do not intend by this proposition
to enter into any conflict of arms with any
Power at home or abroad. What we propose
is that this Government shall be authorized to
extend to the people of these republics the
idea of protection. Our interests and their
interests are the same, and we want peace and
good government there as here. Revolution
succeeding revolution there destroys them and
imperils the institutions of this country. If
there should be a case when we would be re-
quired to enter into a contest of arms with any
Government for this purpose, I submit, with
the gentleman from Ohio, [Mr. Bingham,] that
the Congress of the United States should be
first consulted before any such action shall be
taken. And this resolution contemplates such
a course ; because any action which shall re-
quire, or seem to require, an appropriation of
money shall be inaugurated under the authority
of the national Legislature. I would be very
glad if the idea suggested by my friend can be
embodied iu this resolution in a proper form,
which shall not contravene the object of the
resolution itself.
Mr. FERRISS. While I concur mainly in
many of the views expressed by the chairman
of the Committee on Foreign Affairs, I do not
see very clearly how this proposed protector-
ate can be established and made effectual with
the very limited power which he proposes shall
be exercised by this Government. At the same
time I would ask the gentleman one question,
and if be is at liberty to answer it I should be
very happy to have him answer it; if not, then
to say so. Did the Committee on Foreign
Affairs, in determining to recommend this pro-
tectorate of these republics, regard it as a step
to the ultimate annexation of these islands to
the United States as a part of our territory?
Mr. BANKS. No, sir; the committee had
no such idea, and I had 110 such idea myself.
I ought to say that there was not full time for
the consideration of this matter by the com-
mittee, and therefore I cannot speak for the
views of the members of that committee. Bat
they authorized me to report this resolution to
the House.
Mr. WOODWARD. Mr. Speaker 
Mr. BANKS. I will yield to the gentleman
for a question only.
Mr. WOODWARD. I want to move that
this resolution be laid on the table, in order
that we may have time to examine it.
Several Members. That is right.
Mr. BANKS. I cannot yield for that pur-
pose now. The gentleman will have the op-
portunity to make that motion ; he cannot be
deprived of that.
Mr. WOODWARD. Does the gentleman
propose to press this resolution to a vote
to-day?
Mr. BANKS. I will not say as to that. I
now yield to the gentleman from Illinois, [Mr.
Cci.LOit,] my colleague on the Committee on
Foreign Affairs.
Mr. CULLOM. I simply want to say, Mr.
Speaker, that the understanding of the com-
mittee would not, I think, justify the gentle-
man in calling for a vote upon this resolution
to"-"day.
Hr. BANKS. Very well; I do not care for
a vote to-day.
Mr. CULLOM. I hope the gentleman will
not press the resolution to a vote to-day, as
the understanding was that we should have
time to consider it after it had been reported
to the Honse.
Mr. BANKS. I will yield for a motion to
adjourn at any time.
Mr. JUDD. I ask the gentleman to allow
me two or three minutes for an explanation.
Mr. BANKS. The gentleman will hav| "am-
ple opportunity hereafter to express his views:
Mr. WARD. If the gentleman from Mas-
sachusetts will yield for the purpose, I move
that the House adjourn.
Mr. BANKS. I yield for that motion. If
gentlemen of the House desire further time to
consider this question, I am perfectly willing
that an adjournment shall be had.
On the motion to adjourn, there wereâ€”ayes
68, noes 31.
So the motion was agreed to; and the House
(at four o'clock and five minutes p. m.) ad-i
journed.

Mr. SUMNER. I present the petition of
Mahlon Loomis, M. D., of the District, of Co-
lumbia, who believes that he has invented a
new mode of telegraphing, which he submits is
a great and valuable improvement upon ftny
former mode known or discovered. He briefly
says:
"The nature of tho discovery or invention, in
general terms, consists in establishing an electrical
eurrentorcircuitfor telegraphing without the aid of
wires or cables to form such electrical currents and
circuitSi
" As in dispensing with thedoublewire (which was
at first used) and using but one, allowing and relying*
upon tho earth to form the ono half of the eircuif, g<>
now I propose to dispense* with both wires and all
artificial batteries, using the earth, as now, to foro*
one half of the circuit, and the continuous electrical
element far above the surface of the "earth xor ta<*
other part of the circuit."
After setting forth at som6 length his inven-
tion, or his theory, he asks Congress Tof an
