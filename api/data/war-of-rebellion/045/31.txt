Major-General HEINTZELMAN,

Washington, D. C.:

Through what Gap in the Blue Ridge will General Stahel's cavalry pass to the Shenandoah Valley, and at what time? If he can go through Thornton's Gap, by Luray, to New Market, and thence down toward Winchester, Milroy shall co operate with him. Please answer as soon as possible.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General.

Major-General MILROY,

Winchester, Va.:

I am telegraphed from General Heintzelman that General Stahel's cavalry will pass through Front Royal, but that no co-operation is necessary, as the cavalry is merely sent for a reconnaissance. By Front Royal, I suppose they mean Chester Gap. You may, if you think proper, send up the Valley at the same time as far as Strasburg. They do not answer as to time, but if you conclude to send an expedition, it should, perhaps, be to-morrow. Let me know, and I will inform them.

ROBT. C. SCHENCK,

Major-General, Commanding.
