THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 81,
Scott in the city of Mexico, this Garcia informed ;
Lieutenant Colonel George W. Lay, General !
Scott's military secretary, that he could give in- ;
formation where a large debt was due to the Mexi-
can Government that might be confiscated as prize
of war, if he were allowed a liberal share of it.
This was agreed to*, and he informed Colonel Lay
that there were $26,000 due to the Government
from the petitioners for the purchase money of;
the property in which they were doing business, j
General Scott at once issued the necessary or- :
ders, and the petitioners were required to pay the
amount alleged to be due to the Mexican Govern- ;
ment to General Scott for the use of the United 1
States; but inasmuch as it was payable in install-
ments, and but a small part of it wr.s fine, Gen- i
oral Scott agreed to take £15,000 in cash, and give 1
petitioner a receipt in full fur the $2G,000. Gar- ,
cia was furnished with the necessary papers, in- i
eluding General Scott's receipt for $26,000, and '
upon them received the $15,000 from a broker on !
the check of petitioners. He paid $7,000 into the
military chest of the army of the United States,
retaining $8,000 "for himself and a number of
others." As the committee wete not informed
who those " others" were thatreeeived a portion
of this sum, they thought it possible that there
might have been some collusion between Garcia
and the Laurents, and that they niii;ht have had
a share of this large discount. With the view of
determining thisquostion, Colonel Lay was called
upon and examined orally before the committee.
It appealed from the examination of Colonel Lay
thatthis tiansaetiou had been incidentally inquired
into by a court of lnquuy called by General Scott
in the city of Mexico, in Jannaiy, 1848, for the
purpose of investigating eeilam charges against
Caphiin Melnstry, the record of whieh, with all
the evidence, was on hie in the War Department.
The committee had this record examined, and all
the evidence touching this liansaeuuii copied and
filed with the papers in this case. Hut noihmg
haw been developed by these examinations to war-
rant any imputation of collusion or bad faith on
the pa it of the petiuoneis.
The petitioners seem to have acquiesced very
cheerfully ni the requisition of General Seoti. I)y
paying to him, as commander-in-chief of the
American army, they saved $11,000 of the pur-
chase money which they had agn ed to pay the
Mexican Government, But the committee sup-
pose their mam reason for piefemn^ to make pay-
ment to, and receive their title from, the Govern-
ment of the United States, was, that they had
gieaier confidence m the ability of our Govern-
ment to nmintain them hj then title and possesion
a^uiiiHt the Mexican Church llian in any of the
fleeting dynasties or parties that v/eie nucceeding
each other with so much rapidity m the Govern-
ment of Alexico. Immediately after the evacuation
of Mexico, suit \v«k m.siituted m the Mexican
conns by the Convent of the Immaculate Concep-
tion, to recover possession of the property. The
petitioners applied to Mr. Letcher, then Amew-
can Mmihtei in Mexico, to sustain them in their
title. lie lot warded their application to our Sec-
retary of Stan:, with u Mronu u piesentalum in
their favor, in reply, Mr. Webster stated that
the question of title must be settled by the main-
eipal laws of Mexico, und that our Government
had no ri^ht lo niteifere.
J ud^mont was r< ndered against the petitioners,
and confirmed by the courtuf last resoi t, to which
they appealed. The costs amounu d to over seven
thousand dolKus,and the petitioners weie ousted
from the premises ai the point of the bayonet.
The miluetu.e of the Chutch was biought lo bear

Mr. Nl CLACK. 1 would inquire of the gen-
tleman from New York whyt would he the elfect
of lescmding that resolution 5 Would it not bt; to
increase the number and salaries of the Door-
keeper's employes ?
Mr. RU^SftLL. It would not. Itwouldonly
put theni back m the condition which they weie
in before tSie resolution was passed. That reso-
lution cut down a few of the employes and left
others where they were. I want to ha\e all put
upon the same footing; and then Kt the Commit-
tee of Accounf-s introduce a bill rojruLting the
salaries of all the employes of tin. House.
Mr. RUFF1N. I ask the gentleman whether
he (in! not voir- last session a^amst the motion to :
susjund the mles to enable that convmtteu to in- j
trounce sueh a hill? :
Mr. KU&SELL. Tdid vote at the last session ,
ng'insttt motion to suspend the rules to enable
the committee to introduce a bill to reduce the
compensation of the employes under the Clerk
of the Holish, Postmaster of the House, S(^%eant-
at-Arms,and Doorkeeper. Was not then opposed
to place them all on the same footing. Only de-
i sired they should receive the compensation pro-
vided for by joint resolution, and as provided for
in the appropi iation bill. It is proper to state that
the clerks in the post office of the House aie now
receiving the same salaries as they originally re-
ceived under the resolution.
Mr. RUFFIN. i object to discussion unless
others have an opportunity of replying.
