Major-General SCHOFIELD:

I have just learned from a person I consider reliable that Jackman has a favorite crossing of the Missouri River just below the mouth of La Mine. The banks of the Missouri have been cut down for wagons and the river at present is fordable there. If hard pressed, the rebels might attempt to cross into Northern Missouri. Choteau Springs is 7 miles from mouth of La Mine, near Rocky Ford.

JEFFERSON CITY, MO., October 13, 1863

Major-General SCHOFIELD:

Commanding officer at Tipton reports return of some scouts sent out from that place. The most reliable information is: Rebels, closely pursued by Federals, crossed late last night the Salt Fork of the La Mine at Dug Ford, just above the mouth of the Blackwater, going toward Lexington. General Brown was across La Mine, and was in rear of the enemy. Our advance and rebel rear guard skirmishing for 20 miles from Boonville. Two regiments of General Guitar's command, say the scouts, passed through Boonville last night. Colonel Cole is about 20 miles from Boonville, moving after the enemy. General Ewing left Sedalia at 3 o'clock this morning. I have sent him information you conveyed this afternoon.

Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

A Union prisoner arrived at Glasgow last night; says he escaped from the rebels near La Mine Bridge at 9 o'clock yesterday. They are on the Georgetown road, but said they were going to Marshall, and expected to join another force at Lexington. If this report is true, the force at Boonville must have been only a part of that which crossed the Osage. It is strange we cannot get definite information if there was a force at La Mine yesterday.
