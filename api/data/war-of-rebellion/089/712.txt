Colonel B[RENT]:

The enemy still at work on works between Batteries B and C. Wagons passing backward and forward between camps during the day. No unusual display of troops in open space. On account of fog I could make no observations on north side. Dredging-machine still at work a short distance from the canal.

SPECIAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,No. 320. November 26, 1864.

1. The consolidation for the present into the Third Division of the Fifth Corps of the troops comprising the old First Corps, renders necessary a modification of so much of General Orders, Numbers 10, of March 24, 1864, from these headquarters,* as directed that, in the transfer of the First to the Fifth Corps, the First Corps should retain its badges and distinctive marks, and the badge for the troops of the old First Corps will be the badge provided by existing orders for the Third Division, Fifth Corps, surrounded by a circular belt of the same color as the badge, to indicate that the troops belonged to the First Corps. The division flag will be the flag now authorized, with a circular belt surrounding the corps insignia and of the same color.

FORT MONROE, November 26, 1864 - 10.48 p. m.

General RAWLINS:

I would suggest that it might be better to order Colonel Morgan to report to me in Washington at once, without waiting for my order, instead of extending his leave. During the few days before I enter on my duties he will assist me in getting up my back reports. Colonel Morgan's address is Fort Monroe, care of Colonel Small.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
