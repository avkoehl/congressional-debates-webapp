If I had got the force I asked for at first we could now have had one house at least done at each of the bridges and probably more. I respectfully refer the subject to you for instructions about getting men to work. The arrangements are all made, and everything is in readiness to insure an early completion of the houses if we can get the necessary help.

U. S. ENGINEER AGENCY.

In addition to the foregoing I would report that the current engineer wants of the Armies of the West, so far as they have been made known to me by requisitions, during the month of August have been regularly supplied from this agency.

Respectfully submitted.
