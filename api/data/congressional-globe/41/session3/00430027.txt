Mr. SCHENCK. I yield for a moment to the j|
gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Covode ]
Mr. COVODE. I desire to suggest to the j|
chairman of theCommittee of Waysand Means ;|
that the reference with regard to the erection jj
of new buildings for the State and War De-
partments had better be changed. There are
special requests made by the President with
regard to the building of a new War Depart-
ment and a new State Department. -The ref-
erence in the resolutions just read would send
these to the Committee on Expenditures in the
War Department and to the Committee on
Expenditures in the State Department. But
I would suggest that the reference be made
to the Committee on Public Buildings and
Grounds, as these are both public buildings.
Mr. DAWES. I beg to inform the gentle-
man from Pennsylvania [Mr. Covode] that the
whole matter of public works and estimates for
public buildings has already been referred to
the Committee on Appropriations.
Mr. SCHENCK. And I desire further to
correct a misapprehension under which the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. Covode]
seems to labor, by stating that the expendi-
tures in the War Department and in the State
Department, with regard to which there are
special committees, have nothing to do with
expenditures for the purpose of erecting build-
ings to accommodate these Departments. So
there is really no conflict whatever.
Before the question is takea upon the reso-
lutions, I wish to direct the attention of tho
House, in order that there may be no misap-
prehension, to one thing which characterizes
these resolutions j and that is, the direction
which they have given to all subjects which
relate to the shipping interest. We propose
by our resolutions to refer whatever* affecU
the commerce of the United States, as con-
nected with the shipping interest, to the Com-
mittee on Commerce.
It is well known that there has been hereto-
fore a select commitee having charge of that
subject; but when we were considering this
matter in the Committee of Ways and Means,
which hassubmitted the resolutions, it was un-
derstood thatthat select committee desire only
to make their report and wind up their busi-
ness, embracing Â©nly that which 1ms been
heretofore committed to them. It was thought
desirable, therefore, that the portions of tho
President's messageand accompanying docu-
ments involvingnewpropositions or new meas-
ures connected with this mattcrshould not any
longer be sent to that committee, but should
take the old, natural ordinary course, and
go to the Committee on Commerce. There-
fore it is that, with this understanding, we have
reserved for the Committee on Commerce, and
directed to be given to their control, all that
relates to the subjects to which I have alluded.
I do not know that there is anything else in
the resolutions requiring explanation, and I
hope we shall now have the sense of the com-
mittee upon them. But before asking a vole
I yield for a moment to the gentleman from
Tennessee, [Mr. Maykard.J
Mr. MAYNAPtD. Ididnothavetheplcasure
of listening to the President's message wheu it
was read yesterday. But on reading it, as
published in the papers, I find that it closes
with a very important and pregnant suggestion
on the subject of the purity of elections. I
would ask the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means whether a reference ought
not to be made of that portion of the message?
Mr. SCHENCK. The Committee on the
Judiciary had charge of whatever legislation
there was heretofore on that subject, and it is
still within their jurisdiction. And as the allu-
sion in the message is only a general sugges-
tion, in the nature of a platform more than
anything else, no specific proposition being
offered, we did not think it necessary to make
a reference of that portion of the document.
Mr. MAYNARD. I Â«nly desired to have
it understood that it was not omitted or over-
looked.
Mr. SCHENCK. It was not overlooked,
but, as I have said, it did not contain any
specific proposition.
The question being put on the resolutions,
they were adopted.
Mr. SCHENCK. I move that the commit-
tee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker
having resumed the chair, Mr. Cullom reported
