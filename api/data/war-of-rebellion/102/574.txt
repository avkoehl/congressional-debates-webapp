(Received 9 a. m. 24th.)

Major General JOHN POPE:

Dispatch received. Have the ponies on hand, and will send them if you so direct. I was waiting the arrival of General Dodge, as I understood he had already made disposition of all I had. He will be here to-morrow and I will answer you more fully.

Brigadier General R. B. MITCHELL,

Just returned from the border. We have not got more than forty of those men yet. They are dreadfully scattered. It will take a week yet to finish it up.

Captain JOHN PRATT,

Asst. Adjt. General, District of Kansas, Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

CAPTAIN: It was reported to me on the 21st instant, by a man living on the border near Little Santa Fe, Mo., whom I have had in my employ the past season, that the bushwhackers infesting the border had concluded to leave, go south, and surrender. I also learn to-day, by good authority, that that is their determination, and that there is not much doubt but they have already started. I merely give you this for what it is worth, and shall post you in what information I may gain hereafter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. F. GOBLE,

Second Lieutenant Co. L, Fifth Kansas Vol. Cav., and Asst. Prov. March

Lieutenant R. S. ROE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report for the information of the general commanding that I have just arrived with my command at this post, after making a thorough scout of the country north of the Smoky Hill Fork to the Solomon Fork, and no Indians or recent signs of their whereabouts have been discovered since my command was separated from the main column. The Smoky Hill is at present impassable in consequence of high water. I shall proceed to Fort Larned by easy marches, starting to-morrow morning.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THEO. CONKEY,

Captain, Commanding Battalion in the Field.
