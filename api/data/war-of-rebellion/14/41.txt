Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The whole of the regular infantry and Couch's division sailed early this morning. The Fifth Cavalry is embarked, and as many have sailed as motive power permits. The embarkation of reserve artillery is progressing. Some four or five batteries have sailed. Some two brigades of Sedgwick's division will embark to-day. The Sixth Cavalry will also embark to-day. We are pushing it as rapidly as transports arrive and are coaled.

Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Have this moment heard from the telegraphic operator at Manassas, dated 9 p. m. He says last heard from General Sumner was at Warrenton Junction 8.30 p. m., and all quiet. Orderly expected soon from Warrenton Junction with answer to your (my) dispatch.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

SEMINARY, March 27, 1862-5.40 p. m.

Brigadier-General SUMNER, Near Manassas:

Major-General McClellan directs me to request that you report immediately the situation of affairs at Warrenton junction and with your command.

A report is current here that you have had an affair with the enemy. This is supposed not to be correct or you would have reported the fact ere this to headquarters. The general wishes frequent reports from you, at least twice in twenty-four hours, by telegraph. He is unable to give orders to General Banks until he learns your situation.

Very respectfully,

N. B. SWEITZER,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
