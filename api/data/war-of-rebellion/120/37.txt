of war infected with smallpox from Louisville to Rock Island, forwarded by you on the 22nd ultimo. Captain Jones' report is very full and covers the case very satisfactorily. It shows that he took all proper precautions himself to guard against the spread of the disease, and that his subordinates carried out his instructions as thoroughly as was practicable. But he violated proper courtesy in using in his report the phrase "it is not true that" &amp;c., quoting part of a sentence from my letter, when if he had given the whole sentence his denial would not have been applicable. I stated only what might be inferred from his report and not what actually took place. His explanations sufficiently removed the erroneous was no occasion for his rude contradiction.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,
