[June
Senate.
Senator from Kansas-—Report.
42d Cong....2d Sess.
Question. Was there any time during that
canvass that Mr. Lee had any chance of being
elected against Mr. Pomeroy?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. Or Mr. Carney ?
Answer. Mr. Carney withdrew at an early
day from candidacy for the term for which Mr.
Pomeroy Was aspiring—the long term—and
changed to the short term, because it was ad-
mitted that Mr. Pomeroy would be elected to
the long term.
By Mr. Pomeroy :
Question. Do you know when Mr. Ross ar-
rived at Topeka? You said you were there
from the start.
Answer. I cannot state exactly, of course.
Question. State approximately.
Answer. A week or ten days after the com-
mencement, I should say; or, say, two weeks.
Question. Wbat were Mr. Ross's chances
of election, in the judgment of yourself and
others familiar with the canvass, at the time he
got there ?
Answer. I did not think he had mueh show
at that time, or any, in fact.
Question. Do you know when Perry Fuller
got there?
Answer. I do.
Question. When did he arrive in town ?
Answer. That is, I know within a day or so.
He arrived, I should eay, Thursday night be-
fore the election, which occurred the next
Tuesday. I should say Thursday night or Fri-
day morning.
Question. About four days?
Answer. Three or four days.
Question. You said you wore in my room.
You were there often, I know. Did you see
Perry Fuller there?
Answer. I think I never did.
Question. Do you know of hig occupying
any rooms there with me, or adjoining me?
Answer. I know he did not occupy rooms
near there.
Question. Where did he occupy rooms?
Answer. I do not know where he did occupy
rooms; but he was at the house where I stopped
most of the time.
Question. W hat house ?
Answer. The Topeka House.
Question. Another house?
Answer. Yes, sir; where Carney and Lee
had rooms.
Question. In your testimony before thecom-
mittee of the Kansas Legislature, you say he
told you be had come there to put somebody
through. Whose election did you understand
him to be in the interest of?
Answer. Mr. Boss's.
Question. What did Perry Fuller tell you
when he first arrived in town, if anything?
Answer. Mr. Fuller came to my room ; the
first room, I think, he visited. When he ar-
rived a couple of my friends went for him.
He said to me, ''Well, old Pom. is out of the
woods, and I have come here to put another
man through," or, "to put a man through for
the short term." He said, "I suppose 'old
Pom.' is out of the woods; now I want to get
a man elected for the short termt"
Question. By "old Pom." you mean me?
Answer. That is what he said.
Question. That is the common name there?
Answer. Yes, sir; that is what the boys call
you.
Question■ What occasion wag there, either
before or after Perry Fulls? got there, for my
using any money, or pyoifii^es, of co*nft>t
means at all? •
Answer. There was none, in toy opiftioa.
It was a well-settled feet that you were as
good as elected when Mr. Fuller airrived there,
and before he arrived there. There was no
other candidate for the long term at that time.
They had all retired.
Question. Except Lee?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. What would be your judgment—
it is hardly legal, perhaps—'but what would be
your judgment of a man using money under
such circumstances ? Do you know me as a
business man?
Answer. I should not suspect you of doing
it.
Question. One question further. Do you
know P. B. Maxsou ? ■
Answer. I do.
Question. Do you know of his feeing in the
employ of the Missouri, Kansas, and Texas
railroad at one time about their lands?
Answer. I believe he was.
Question. Do you know how long he was in
their employ?
Answer. I do not. I have no idea.
Question. What is Mr. Maxs«n's standihg
in Kansas ?
Answer. I should think it was fair. He
lives some distance from me, you know, and
I am not competent to answer that question
very positively. I should say, outside of pol-
itics, which is apt to damage most men's rep-
utations, and he has been in it some, that he
stands very well.
Question. Do youknow any thing against him?
Answer. No, sir; nothing.
Question. Do you know who introduced the
resolution into the Legislature to make this
investigation ?
The Witness. In your case?
Mr. Pomehoy. In my case.
Answer. Tom Fenlon, of Leavenworth.
Question. Had there been previously a reso-
lution to investigate Mr. Caldwell?
Answer. Yes, sir.
Question. Was my name in the original
resolution at all ?
Answer. No, sir.
Question. How longafterthe original resolu-
tion was adopted was it till my name was
added to it?
Answer. Well, several days. I do not know
exactly, but several days.
Question. Have you examined your testi-
mony in this book as it is printed?
Answer. I have not.
Question. I refer to the testimony you de-
livered. before the joint committee of the
Kansas Legislature to investigate this subject.
Answer. I have not.
Question. Will you tell me whether you are
correctly reported so far as you have read it ?
Answer. Oh, 1 looked over this once. I
meant by examined a careful examination.
I have examined it sufficiently to answer that
question. I can answer that I was incorrectly
reported. I recollect distinctly quite a long
answer that was left out entirely. They ques-
tioned me about Perry Fuller coming there,
and who he came to put through, and I said,
"Mr. Ross;" and the question was whether
the same men that supported Mr. Ross sup-
ported Mr. Pomeroy, and I said, "Yes, m
the main, but that there was no combination
between them, because Mr. Pomeroy's elec-
tion was assured before Perry Fuller got
there, or Ross was a probable candidate."
That part of my answer does not appear here
at ail. This is a very incomplete and frag-
mentary report. They asked me what my bill
was there, and I said, "My board at the l^st
election and not many extras." They have
it, " My board and many extras." They left
out the " not."
Question. Have you read the report that this
committee fnade upon that testimony?
Answer.'Yes, sir.
■ Question. Does the testimony sustain the
report, in your judgment?
Answer. No, sir; nor in that of anybody
else m our country.
[The foregoing evidence having been read
ovter to the witness, he adds the following:
Mr. Perry Fuller was at the Topeka House,
where I stopped part of the time, and perhaps
most of the time. 3

book A," and "journal A."
Question. Do they contain his accounts?
Answer. Yes, sir; all that I have in my
possession.
Question. I Wish you would turn to any
account in these books showing any transac-
tions between Mr. Pomeroy and Mr. Fuller.

only account of Mr. Pomeroy in that book.
Question. You say that is the only account
of Mr. Pomeroy that appears in the books?
Answer. Yes, sir; that is the only account.
That is "January 24, 1866, to Northrup &
Chick." That was a check by Mr. Fuller to
Mr. Pomeroy. Mr. Pomeroy is charged with
it. The amount is $3,000. The next entry is
dated March 21, 1866, and is a draft on "B.,
S. & Co.," which means Buckley, Sheldon &
Co., New York, for $1,500. Against it is a
credit, paid Juue 27, by check of Pomeroy's,
which was cashed at Rittenhouse, Fowler &
Co.'s.

24, 1866, and the next March 26, 1866 ?
