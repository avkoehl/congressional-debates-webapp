thing depends on it. Send back to-night information of your position, and whether the country you are in offers advantages for offense and defense. I apprehend you will not be able to feed your animals. Be sure your dispatches get through. You should send by more than one route. Of course General Crittenden will act under your orders.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 22, [1862].

General NEGLEY, Columbia:

What damage has happened to the bridge at that place and how did it occur?

(Same to J. B. Anderson, Nashville.)

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 22, 1862.

General ROSECRANS, Iuka:

Mitchell to leave tents and unnecessary baggage; fill his wagons with rations and make forced marches to Nashville. Paine to march in same manner to Decherd. Both must go on half rations and carry all the provisions they can and leave tents.

JAMES B. FRY.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 22, [1862].

General ROUSSEAU, Huntsville:

Your regiments must make forced marches and reach here in forty-eight hours. Keep your whole command in readiness to march, but without exciting suspicion; I may call it here or elsewhere. Forward all subsistence when trains arrive except 20,000 rations.

McCook reports Bragg's advance on the march, say 10 miles from Chattanooga, last night, and that his destination is McMinnville. If such be the fact I shall call you all up.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 22, 1862.

HEADQUARTERS, Decherd, August 22, [1862].

Major SIDELL, Nashville:

Have you any further information of General Johnson or the movements of the enemy?
