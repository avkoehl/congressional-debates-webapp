of December 19, 1864, and that number deducted from the enrollment. Add that number to the number enrolled April 30, 1865, and we have 2,443, 187, showing a difference of only 43,288 between those figures and the enrollment upon which quotas under the call of December 19, 1864, were based. I am satisfied these quotas were equitably distributed, so far as the enrollment affected them.

Before closing this report I shall offer a few suggestions on the subject of enrollment, based upon experience and the remarks contained in the reports of provost-marshals.

MODE OF DRAFTING, &amp;C.

The general rule observed in drafting has been as follows: Immediately upon the completion of the enrollment of a district the name of each person enrolled was written on a card, together with the number of the sub-distinct in which enrolled and his number on the enrollment sheet. These cards were uniform in size and color, and when all the names had been written the cards were compared with the names on the sheets, and if found correct were carefully filed away in envelopes, by sub-districts, until the draft was ordered.

Public notice was given through the newspapers and other sources of information. Civil officers and prominent individuals were invited to attend and witness the proceedings. On the day before the draft took place the cards were taken out of the packages and again compared with the enrollment sheets, and all necessary corrections made to correspond with the changes in the enrollment. The draft was made as publicly as possible. When all was prepared the name of the first sub-district to be drawn was called and two representatives from that locality were invited to test the correctness of the cards with the enrollment sheets. The cards were placed in the wheel (or box) and well shaken up; a blindfolded man then placed his hand in the wheel and drew therefrom a single card, passed it to the commissioner of the Board, who,
