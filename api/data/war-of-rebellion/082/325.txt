HEADQUARTER CAVALRY CORPS, July 18, 1864.

General HUMPHREYS:

Yours of 1.30 a. m. received. I have to report that I have made no changes in the force picketing the roads between the Blackwater and the James since relieving General Gregg. The Prince George Court-House road between Blackwater and the James is now picketed by troops from my command other than Colonel Devin's brigade.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 18, 1864 - 9.20 p. m.

Major-General SHERIDAN,

Commanding Cavalry Corps:

Your dispatch relive to loss by guerrillas at Sycamore Church is received. The commanding general directs me to say in reply that any houses in which guerrillas are habitually harbored, and the owners of which you have notified, you would destroy unless the guerrillas cease to use them; you may burn after such notification. In giving this authority the commanding general wishes to avoid punishing innocent parties who may not have it in their power to prevent the offenses being committed.

A. A. HUMPHREYS.
HDQRS. SECOND BRIGADE, FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,July 18, 1864 - 8 a.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Potomac:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report all quiet in front of my lines at this hour and no alarm during the night. Patrols sent out at 3 a. m. on the left and rear to Lee's Mill, and on right and rear to Norfolk road, have returned and report "no sign of the enemy." Nothing else of moment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOS. C. DEVIN,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
