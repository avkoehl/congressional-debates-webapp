to the public Treisur} fiom a permine t separa-
t 01 fron the bmks What are the mjm es, the
nnfivoiab'e infl lences if am, to stand against
these ' i nefiu? He had heard but one suggested,
so far as the interests and conveniences of the
Treasuij are concerned, and he mast say but that
one had occurred to his mtnd 1 he expense and
troub'e of remitting specie, m cases vvhete that
she aid become nece^arv, w as, he Believed, the only

this object  n
Under the system oí oank deposites, drarls from
the Treasurer, upon the different depositor "*, and
from one depos tory upon another, are made the
medium of remtttvnee in all ordinary c? es, and,
where the draf's are fully ciedited, supers°ae t ie
necessity of an actual transportation of the money
in almost all the operauois ot the public Trea>un

deposite bank, and when they are known tobe
drawn upon the specie in safe keeping, and upon
nothing el«e, the) can not fail to be as acceptable
to the public cred tor as any similar drafts have
heretofore been The trouble and expense, thete

was to s ich <in institution, in name or in pnnciple,
is they wool 1 cen pronise by the acceptarce of
sich a bmk as this bil' would establish, they
should have u v ith his Gheerful assent, and this
longind heated agitation about a Government bmk
should be for ever amicably settled
He vou'd nov look at the influences of this
measure upon the Governn ent
It wou d discharge its legislation fiom bank in-
fluences of all sorts Hj spake not of improper
or corrupt influences, hut of those constituent inte
rests, which must be represented in Congress so
long as the connection between the public Ireisury
and banks of inv descr ption was maintained
He addr"ss d trose who must uncusta-^d him, ard
who mti'i ha e seen and relt thesa 'nflaence iroui
oficial a non here Wh >, íe would psk, hid oc-
cupied one of thes  seats for the list five jears, ind
had not seen the po ver of this inPuence upon our
deliberatu ns"* Who had fai'ed to see thai it w as
an influence mo-e nearly overpowering and be-
yond our contr >1 thin any w e hid been called to
encountar1 Who tad not see and feel it now as
pressing upon us with a giant fore '* It was tiuc,
we had former!} and most Usually encountered it in
the consolidated f m of a national bank, and that
it now presented itself to us m State detachments,
but it w as ihe same influence similarly exerted
It was the effort of cupidity on our free institutions
—an effoit to make money out of the monc} and
means and credit of the people
He uttered these sentiments with extreme re-
Inctance, and with the most exten led chuily to-
wards all those who differed from him He knew
well that not onlv political opponents, but tho«e
who had eve<- been political and peisonal friends —
thost towards v horn he had ever entertained and
slid di 1 ente ta , the I ml st fieim¿ , ch 1 d fTVr
with him upon hese pom s He mo t chi-or'ud}
}ielded to 'heir integrity, «incerit}, and patiiotistn,
ever} mdu'gence which he asked foi himself, but
the crisis, the importance oi tne que tions presented,
and our imperious duly to our cons'ituent , de-
manded fiom us frank and fearless action
Was it not, then in case he v as right, most
desirable to free the legislation of Congress from
bank mflu°n"e altogether* Would it not tend
more thin any other single act we could perform,
to take from otsr debates and deliberations that bit-
terness and ->enmon} wh en h d tco strongly cha-
ñe enzed d em f - ti° 1 st frvv jeais, but which
he was pr ml t) sav, ba I crt"iel, in a much lesa
degree, into th" present debí em tl e 5-ei te, than
into an} simt'ar debate forman} }ears? Forhimsflf,
he felt that tms cons deration ilone demarded tKe
passage of this bill that it was entirely paramount
to any objections he had j et heard urged against
it, that it wa as much supei icr to cons derations of
financial conven ence and pecuniary profit, as
was the puntv and permanenc} of oui pol tica!
institutions to the temporary advaitises of a bar-
gam or the fac hues of borrowing monej
This was nit the only advantage the Govern-
I ment «ould deuve from apermanent scoarat on of
its finances fion the bmks It would dischirge it
from that eternal round of ímputitioi s to which,
unt'ei the con eetion, its eveiy fiscal action is sue-
lee el If it 1 c a t me of prosperity pud plent},
all are stregging "cr the profits aus n«, from the
sife keeping of the Govern ent funds, aid the
failure on t e part of its f'cal ofiicei ti seleet a
given b n\ as a public depositor!, is not onlv
j matter oi rersonil offence, but is immediately c n-
1 ve tel into the ectiveeii.se ot all the pecuniar}
calamities which t c fuends and customers of that
bank my expenerce through il> t me to come
If it be a tin^e o'scarcity end pusoire, hi e the
present the di^ft of the Ireisurei upon the mone}
of I e people n safe 1 eepinc with the ban us i a
rath'e^s it'icl a war upon them, and is intended
to pro t ate the nstitu ion The formei keeping
of the funds becomes a merit ind i virtue and to
ask for their pavoent to t e punlic creditors is
ingratitude and injust ce
If he Exe-ulive m the e\eicise of a soun I dis
cret on sees propel to issue an older requiring pay-
ment in money for  rhp whole, cr any portion, ol
the public re\ enue, this is cc nvert d into an attack
upon the banks, a distiust oí then credit and sol-
vency and a wrong inflicted b} .be Government
upon the whole people Can it be desirable to pre-
serve a connection which is the subject of inces-
sant complaint on the part ef the banks and
their ir ends, and of cons ant embarrassment
to the operations of the pubhc Treasury, and of
imputation upon the most faithful and worthy
public oftieers^ He thought not He cons dered
this connection of tne fiscal affans of the Govern-
ment with the credit and business of the banks,
and of business and commercial men, ani the con-
stant imputations brought upon the Government
thereb\, as promoting a political mcrahty in the
public mind most dangerous to our institutions, as
doing more to weaken the confidence of the people
in the Governmen* oí then che ice, than any and
all other causes of distrust combined If we would
lisien to the slander and misrepresentations of the
time , we must bel eve that all out misft rtunes,
public ?nd private, are imputab'e to oar Govern-
ment—all our picspent} to a lesistance to its mea-
sures and us pchcT And v hence do the e impu-
tations come, but from our connection with the
banks' They all emanate from that soiree, and
from no othei Thit connection *s now dissolved,
by the operation of 'aw and th  \ o^ntarv action
of the banks themselves, and he would say, let it
be peipetual—'et it never be renewed
The effect of this measure upon the banks should
next occupy his attention
It had been considered as a measure of open and
violent hostility to those institutions, as fraught
with unmixed evil to thei Was this the true
view of if? Had it these exclusive tendencies1
He th night not, and tie would attempt to point out
soTie positive benefits 'o the banl s from its adop-
tion
It v" M l°"ve tl e St t ban s to opérale upon
their o\ n meins—jptn the capitils «inch the re-
spective State Les slatuieo haa thought proper to
give to them, and upon tlu funds derived from
their private dppo 'ors These means wou'd ba
perfectly certain and uniform, so far as they con-
sisted of the capitals of the banks, ?nd would be
subject to no dangeroas fluctuations, s@ far as they
consisted of private deposites Hence the action of
the institutions could alwa} s be regulated by a cer-
ta n standard—the extent of their means for the ac-
con m< dation of their customers This would dis-
chirge them from the inducement to those dan-
gerous expansions and contract ors, which not
on'y piorrotc, but catss, revulsions such as that
under which the countr} now suffer:
The Government has been charged %v ith being
the cauce of the present pecuniar} embarrassments
oí the co írtrj , and he thoi ght not v ltnout some
foundation, but he considered the ctnnection be-
tweeu the Tieisurv and the b-<nks the on y foui -
da'ion for such aclirge What had we dore1

countrv importations had become excessis e, and
the c'mi°s thereuponnad s \elieitfhe public revenue

The banks received the excess of revenue which

propriations did not cell fir The sane causes
p omoted urusnil a"d unexampled sales of the
public bnds, and thus from both of the great
