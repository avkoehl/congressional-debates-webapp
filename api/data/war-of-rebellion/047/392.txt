Referred to Chief of Ordnance.

It is of first importance that these troops should be armed. It may become necessary to withdraw troops from General Beauregard to re-enforce General Bragg, who has applied for re-enforcements from that quarter, and these six-months' regiments could take their places.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

OCTOBER 5, 1863.

Respectfully returned to the Adjutant and Inspector General.

Three thousand arms have just been ordered from here, in addition to those just reported as on hand in General Beauregard's department.

J. GORGAS.

CHARLESTON, S. C.,

October 5, 1863.

Lieutenant General JAMES LONGSTREET,

Chickamauga, near Chattanooga, Tenn.:

In view of enemy's present apparent plan of operations here, am disposed to lend you Anderson's brigade, provided no military necessity will prevent its return when called for here. Cannot Bragg send me about 5,000 stand of arms for arming my State troops?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

CHARLESTON, S. C., October 5, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

General Longstreet asks me to spare him Anderson's brigade for short time. Am disposed to risk it, in view of enemy's apparent plan of operations here at present, but must expect authority to recall it at discretion, despite any alleged military necessity there.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

RICHMOND, October 5, 1863.

General BEAUREGARD:

Send General Anderson's brigade to General Longstreet. The case is urgent.

S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

CHARLESTON, S. C., October 5, 1863.

M. L. BONHAM,

Governor of South Carolina, Columbia, S. C.:

If 2,000 or 3,000 small-arms, called for by my chief of ordnance, from Colonel Gorgas, be not furnished, I must disband several six-months' regiments lately called out, and which are consuming provisions uselessly.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
