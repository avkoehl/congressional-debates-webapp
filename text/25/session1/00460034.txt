TlEASURY   DepaRTMINT,
14th September, 1837
Sib This report is submitted in compliance with
thefoiloing resolution, parsed on the 11th instant
"Resolved, That the Secretsr, of the Treasury be
directed, wah e. li le delaj --possible, to comn u-
mcate to this House the a i ount oí the aj propria-
tions of the pas' and piesent ¡ears reroiining
unexpended, the amount itqtured to fulfil ill exist-
ing engagements contracted, prior to the that day of
June last, aid ah existing engagements contracted
since that time, also, the amount of money drawn
from the Tieasurv and placed m the hands of dis-
tancing officers or agents on the first diy of May
list and at the present time, and thit he also report
v hat objects ot public expenditure can with the
least injury to the public service be either wholly
dispensed with during the present jeai, or bear any
material íeduction "
The tabular statement annexed shows, as
desued, "the amount of the appropriations of the
past and present > ears remaining unexpended" to
be $34,075,239 37 (A)
In íeply to the inquiry as to " the amount of
money drawn from the Treasury , and placed in the
hands of disbursing orneen, or agents, on the first
diy of May last, and at the present time .should
state, that at the former period it appear ^ have
been #5,264,052 95, and at the la.er #5,049,540 76
It may be useful to add that both sums aie much
largei than they would othei wise be, m consequence
of the unusual amount of deposites by officers of
the mint
In relation to " uh u eibjects of public expendí
ture can, with the least injury to the public service,
be either wholly dispensed with lunng the present
year, or bear any material reduction," I would ob-
serve, that a minute and critical examination on
this point, was instituted in May last by this De-
partment
The result of it was, that enough of it could and
would be postponed till next year, to amount to
about #15,000,000
Consequently, the expenditures during the present
yeai were estimated in my recent report upon that
basis After e\ er j delay of them w hioh the public
mteiestmay permit, it is therefore expected, that,
ol the outstanding appiopnations now exceeding
$24,000,000, not much over nine millions will
necessatily be required to be expended during the
residue of the year
Since the resolution passed, further inquiries on
this point were instituted in connection with the
other depaitments of the Government, but the le-
sult has not been essentially varied, from that to
which the department arrived last spnng The
partícula! he ids of appiopnations, that it is sup-
posed need not, and «ill not, be expended m full
duiity the year, and the amounts unda each are
very numei ros and difficult to be prepared, but if
rif sued will be submitted hereafter with as little de-
1IV as practicable
The only remaining inquiry is " the amount re-
quired to fulfil all existing engagements contracted
prior to the first day of June last, and all existing
engagements contracted since that time "
Each department has been requested to furnish a
«tatement on this subject as early as it can be com-
pleted But some delay being unavoidable, it has
jn the mean time, been deemed advisable to sub-
mit immediately the answer to the other portions of
the resolution
Those statements will be made as comprehemive
as possible, but can, of course, relate to only a
small pan of tne «hole appropriations of Congress,
which it has been and «ill be, necessary to expend
during the year Alls lanes of Judicial, Executive,
or otner officers, the cxperses of foreign intercourse,
the pay and subsidence m both the army and navy,
all pensions, alt Indian annuities, all private bilk
which have passed, many miscellaneous appropria-
tions, with several other items, stand independent
of any special engagements or contracts made by
a f pubi't o^ ei and cam< t, therefoic, enter into

ing was then taken, up

amended by annexing thereto, or incorpoiatmg
theiewith, any other bill or resolution pending be-
fore the House, noi by any proposition containing
the substance, in whole or in part of any other bill
or resolution pending before the House "
Mr BELL briefly opposed this amendment on
the ground that, thoufh it might correct an occa-
sional abuse,} et us adoption n ould too much crip-
ple the House, for it would be unable to engraft a
bill of the Senate, which all might deem expe-
dient
Mr MERCER, then moved to strike out all after
the word " house" in the third line, agreed to, and
the on¿mal amendment, as amended, was agreed
to
The follomng amendments «ere a¿ieed to with-
out a division)
13th Amend the 55th rule bv adding two stand-
ing committees, each to consist of five members, to

he Buildings and Giounds to consider all subjects
