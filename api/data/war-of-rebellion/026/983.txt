might perhaps suit. It would be a very good thing; I wish you would urge it. It would greatly help al of our operations to have a couple of independent regiments.

Very truly, yours,

General D. H. HILL, Rocky Mount, N. C.:

General Evans' brigade being sent from Wilmington to Charleston, replace it with a brigade. General Longstreet is informed of this.

Lieutenant General JAMES LONGSTREET, Franklin, Va.:

General Whiting still urges re-enforcements. Send force to replace Evans' brigade.

Secretary of War.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., April 13, 1863.

Lieutenant General JAMES LONGSTREET:

GENERAL: Your letter of the 11th instant has been delivered by your courier. General Whiting calls still so urgently for re-enforcements to replace General Evans' brigade (sent on to Charleston) that the mater has been laid before the President, and his judgements that it would be unsafe to leave Wilmington without such re-enforcements. Therefore I telegraphed you this morning that such should be sent. I will now, having learned General hill's address through your letter, telegraph him directly to the same effect. I regret very much to interfere in any way with your concerted arrangements, but an engagement was previously given to send forward a brigade when required to Charleston, and I did not feel at liberty to disregard it. As explained to you in a previous letter, I had supposed you acquainted with that arrangement. I do not propose that more than one brigade be sent to Charleston to be supplied at Wilmington. That will not, I trust, materially interfere with the plans of General Hill or yourself.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War.

P. S.-The above letter was returned by the same courier.

WAR DEPARTMENT, C. S. A.,

Richmond, Va., April 13, 1863.

Brigadier General W. H. C. WHITING, Wilmington, N. C.:

General Hill has been ordered to send a brigade to replace Evans', to be forwarded to Charleston.

J. A. SEDDON

Secretary of War.
