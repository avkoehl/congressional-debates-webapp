General BRAYMAN:

The enemy is all around me. It takes all my men to do duty. They are worn out and broken down. I stand in need of more forces. If you can spare them, please send.

I sent for 30,000 rounds of .58-caliber ammunition some days since. Captain Odlin said it should be sent; it has not come yet; I stand in need of it. I also sent for artillery ammunition, the amount and character I wanted; it has not come. I may need it before it gets here.

S. G. HICKS,

Colonel, Commanding Post.

PADUCAH, KY., April 11, 1864.

Brigadier-General BRAYMAN:

None of the ammunition I sent for has come yet; please send it as soon as possible. Five companies of Faulkner's command came into Mayfield las night, and 180 rebels within 6 miles of this place this morning, hovering around us.

S. G. HICKS,

Colonel, Commanding.

PADUCAH, April 11, 1864.

General BRAYMAN:

God bless you for your prompt attention to my request in relation to ammunition. I am looking and waiting for Messrs. Forrest &amp; Co. There is an awful shaking among the timid, but the righteous are bold as a lion.

S. G. HICKS,

Colonel, Commanding.
