FORAGING.

The troops were mainly supplied with provisions from the country. The region through which we passed was not thickly populated, and in most districts poorly cultivated. The time of year was one in which supplies could not be found in great excess, even in a rich country. The only efficient method of supplying the troops was found to be through mounted details. These details, taken in equal proportion from each regiment, I directed to be composed of the best soldiers in the command. The mounted force, thus formed in each brigade, was placed under command of one of its best officers, who had his lieutenants. They mounted themselves in the country, and were required to keep under good discipline. The strictest orders were given, forbidding them to pillage, and requiring them to confine their foraging to the limits of supplies and other articles necessary for the troops. The officers commanding them were held responsible for the enforcement of these orders and for keeping their men well in hand. Whenever a member of these details proved cowardly he has dismounted and returned to his place in the ranks. That acts of pillage and wrong to defenseless inhabitants were committed by foragers when not under the eye of their officers we had daily evidence, but I am satisfied that if a uniform system of discipline and organization among foraging details throughout the army were rendered imperative, these abuses could be prevented. No foraging parties should be allowed to leave the main body, except those regularly authorized, under command of energetic and faithful officers, who could be relied upon not only to obtain supplies, but to control every man under their command. None but the best soldiers should be mounted for the purpose, and every breach of discipline, by exhibition either of cowardice or cruelty, should be promptly and severely punished. This system should be enforced throughout the entire army to render the plan of subupon the country honorable as well as efficient.
