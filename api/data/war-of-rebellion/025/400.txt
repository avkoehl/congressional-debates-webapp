BETHEL, TENN., December 11, 1862.

Major-General GRANT:

Scout Perkins, just in from Yellow Creek, 15 miles above Hamburg, reports Roddey's men, 800 strong, there. Left there at daylight this a. m.; says there are several ferry-boats in river-one at State Line Ferry, one at Yellow Creek, and the other above Yellow Creek. No report of forces crossing. Perkins gathers from secesh that Roddey is said to be the advance of larger forces. Southern scrip in good demand up there. Returned Confederates say the army is destitute and is coming on this way after supplies. Scouts start to-night to hunt main forces.
