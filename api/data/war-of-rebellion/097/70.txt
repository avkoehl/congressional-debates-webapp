Major General C. C. AUGUR,Commanding Department of Washington:

Major-General Hancock desires the Second Regiment, First Veteran Corps, Lieutenant-Colonel Kusserow commanding, to be ordered to report to Brevet Major-Colonel Brooke at Halltown, near Harper's Ferry, as soon as practicable. A scout of one regiment of cavalry and one of infantry left here yesterday to go through Loudoun County an to Ashby's and Snicker's Gaps. They were at Hillsborough last night. The fords of the Shenandoah are not yet passable, and Mosby's men will be obliged to move toward you.

HDQRS. DEPT. OF WASHINGTON, 22nd ARMY CORPS, Washington, D. C., March 21, 1865.

General BARNES,Commanding at Point Lookout:

General Grant wants the Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry. Can you spare it? General Hoffman thinks, 1,000 men there will be sufficient. By bringing in your detachments, except at the Government farms, will you not have more than that number? Please let me know at once.

C. C. AUGUR,

Major-General.

POINT LOOKOUT, March 21, 1865. (Received 11.20 p. m.)

Major-General AUGUR,

Commanding:

I should recommend that the Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry be ordered o the front. I will make the best disposition of the force left here, and if necessary it would be far better to fill up the regiments of the Veteran Reserve Corps. As cavalry the Fifth Massachusetts are of no use here. It will make a good regiment in the performance of their regular duty as cavalry.

J. BARNES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
