Lieutenant Colonel RICHARD C. DRUM,

Asst. Adjt. General, Deaprtment of the Pacific, San Francisco:

COLONEL: I have th honor to report that the insturctions from department headuqarters of date July 2, in reference to affording protectin to persons and trains passing over the mail route from THrinidad to Gold Bluffs, has been complied with. A detachment of seventeen men of the First Battalion Mountaineees, California Volunteers, is stationed at Trinidad, and is constantly performing escort service between the two places. The line of coast between Fort Humboldt and Camp Lincoln, a distance of nearly 100 miles, is but sparsely inhabited by white people, though there is considerable property. At present there are not large numbers of Indian living immediately on the coast, except at the Klamath River, yet it is easy of access to them, and they desire undisputed possession of it. To hold the Indians under proper restraint it will be necessary, in my opinion, to have a military psot established at some point north of, but not mahy miles distant from, Trinidad. To garrison it about half of one company would be required. But a moderate outlay in money would be necessary in the construction of the buildings needed.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

S. G. WHIPPLE,

Lieutenant Colonel First Battalion Mountaineers, California Vols.,

Commanding Humboldt Military District.
