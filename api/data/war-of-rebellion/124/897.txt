I shall try to see you again about the 25th instant, but hope to receive your reply to this before I leave here.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Supervising Special Agent, Treasury Department.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL'S OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 19, 1863.

His Excellency WILLIAM A. BUCKINGHAM,

Governor of Connecticut, Hartford, Conn.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that Connecticut's quota of the 300,000 volunteers called for by the President's proclamation of the 17th instant is as follows: First District, 1,527; Second District, 1,369; Third District, 1,108; Fourth District, 1,428; total, 5,432.

This quota is the proportion of 300,000 men which Connecticut should furnish, according to the number of the first class enrolled in that State, and without any regard to the quota assigned her for the present draft, or the number of men obtained under that draft, and without regard to any deficiency she may have had under the calls for volunteers previous to the assignment of quotas for the present draft.

The quota of Connecticut for the present draft was as follows: First District, 2,162; Second District, 1,939; Third District, 1,569; Fourth District, 2,021; total, 7,691.

Up to the 17th instant the number obtained on these quotas was as follows: First District, 749; Second District, 614; Third District, 624; Fourth District, 521; total obtained, 2,508, leaving on present draft as made up to the 17th instant a deficiency of 5,138. On all calls previous to the present draft the deficiency of Connecticut was 1,748; total deficiency, 6,931. The total quota, therefore, of Connecticut for the next draft, in case another is rendered necessary by a failure to raise volunteers, as it appears from records up to the 17th instant, would be 5,432, the quota of 300,000 herein assigned, and the deficiencies up to date specified, that is, 6,931; total quota, 12,363.

But this total deficiency (6,931) will of course be reduced by all held to service under the present draft after the 17th instant, and by all volunteers not heretofore credited, as well as by all the State may raise in excess of 5,432, her quota of 300,000 as called for by the President's proclamation.

If Your Excellency thinks best to subdivide the quotas herein assigned to Congressional districts, and allot proportional parts to smaller subdivisions of your State, I would ssubject of credits in drafts hereafter you regard the enrollment of the first class made by this Bureau as the basis of assignment.

The provost-marshal-general of your State and the boards of enrollment in the different districts will give you all the aid in their power in this and all other matters connected with raising troops.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
