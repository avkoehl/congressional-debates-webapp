Mr D explained to the committee the effect of
his proposition, and submitted some general re-
marks in regard to the reform and retrenchment
which they had underiaken to carry oat He had
not consluded when, the hour of 2h having ar-
rive i,
The House took a recess un'il 4 o'clock.
Evening Session
After the recess,
Mr DAVIS of Kentucky resamed his remarks
in support of his amendment. He spoke at «ome
length in favor of reducing the salaries of all offi-
cers in the employ of Government When lhat
*hall be the case, he contended that the Executive
would no longer be annoyed, a¡> under the present
system of high salaries. If the salaries were not
higher than a fair compensation, then individual*
would no longer aspire to office, for it would hold
out no inducement. Mr D went on to show, that
by this plan the influence of the Executive would
be lessened, and concluded by slightly modujing
his amendment
Mr SAI/fONSTALL, agreed tsat this subject
required aitentioD,and that there were many abuses
m the system whica called loudly for reform He
submitted, however, whether at this Ute period of
tae session there was time for the investigation 11
so important a matter. Only a few days rema ned
of the session, and ihere weie now po less than
five appropriation bills to be acted upon He
hoped, therefore, thai ihy appropriation bills would
be first passed, and ihe present subject be post-
poned until there should be a more favorable op-
portunity for doing it justice.
Mr WADDY THOMPSON hoped, that in
cace he couid not vote for the proviso, he
should not be accused cf being oppo5ed to retrench-
ment and reform If the svstem were an evil, it
appeared to him an irremediable evil. Mr. W.
proceeded to contend that all hough in two or
three places tha fees of United States district a'-
tornies, e'c. might be too large, jet m the majority
of cases in various parts of tie cournry, tie com-
pensation was hardly rufiicient to ensure the ser-
vices of compe ent men The cop equence vas,
that, in numerous instance', none but third rs> e
lawjers could be procured to act for the Govern-
ment It was absurd and unjust to reduce the
fees of a whole class merely because one or two
might receive a liberal sum. The fee bill did
undoubtedly require s-ome alterations, but yet he
did not hesitate to say that the fees in the majority of
cases in other parts of ¡he Union, were not suffi
cient to ensure the services of competent men.
Mr MASON of Ohio folio we 1, and concluded
by rawing a point of order as to whether the provi-
so in qiestion could, undtr the rules, be inserted n
an appropriation b'H
Mr VA^DERPOEL contended that the provi-
so, according to ihe previous practice of the House,
was strictly in order. He referred to various in-
stances to skow that, when crymg aouses existed,
Congress had always correcied those abuses in an
appropriation bill. Mr V also gave his views
at some length on the merits of the question in-
volved m the proviso.
The point of order raised by Mr Mason still
pending,
The CHAIR observed that he could not decide
that the proviso should be stricken from the bill,
because the committee on'y bad the power, and
could strike out the proviso as improperly reported
if they thought propel. "Were the Chair to de-
cide that it should be stricken out on the ground
that it was improperly reported, it would be a
usurpation of power He m jst therefore leave it
for tneac'ioi of the committee
The committee then acquiesced in the decision
of ihe Chair
The question then bun  on the amendment of
Mr Davis to the motion of Mr Hdnt to strike out
the proviso,
Me-sis GRINNELL, VANDERPOEL, and
MONROE, gave their views
Mr. FLOYD said that he had not intended to ad-
dress the committee upon this provision of the bill
for reducing the fees of district attorneys, and
should not do so now, were he not an ardent ad-
mirer of the principles of ' economy and reform,"
which appeared to be deserted by th^ss who had
profe sed for them ihe highest regard. We have
been told (said Mr. F ) that the party which has
lately triumphed had inscribed, in the ample folds
of its banner, 'economy and reform," and he sup-
posed, when be came to attend this session of Con-
gress, lhat those who had preached so loud and so
long on that subject would make some attempt to
practise, after election, what they had preached be-
fore the election We have been to.d, too, that the
present Administration has been condemned lor i s
extravagance, and where is the member on this
floor, of the Opposu on party, who can rise m his
p'ace and say that he did not give circulation to
speeches, delivered here at the last session, de-
nouncing the Administration as pi ofli¿ate and ex-
travagant' A id yet we have reached the 17ihpage
of ttie general appropriation bill, and the first
dollar is not yet stricken out by any move
from any member of this great "economy and re-
form" paity. An honorable member has told us
that the refoim called for by the recent election is
a general reform, and not a trifling picayune busi-
ness So be it Let him apply bis gtnera re
fuñí to this bul, and reduce tie exotnses oí the
Govxmmut. Another has told i,s mat they wnl
b-gvi the work when they have the power Sn,
said Mr F they hit•- the power do*—let them
try , and if an, one has ihe courage to make the
attempt, my word for it, he will find enough here
to hHp him cairy it through Now is the üa e to
commence the good work, before the offices ate
filled with their friends , now, when they cin «s.
cape the odium of reducing salaries after app uiit-
ments are made Wi 1 they be moic willing to ap-
ply the pruning kniL when their political friends
are in posses ion of the office 1 Why, sir, u is
but a day or two since, that my honorajU co league
from the Co'umO'i Dis'ricí [Mr Vandí-hpofl] at-
tempted to strike out an appropriation of <$1,000
fo a clerk in tie Fifth AudiUr'i cilice, but, al-
though tl>e cl^kship is vacant, and has been tor
some Lme, he pot no ai 1 from the economy and re-
form patty, tl ey shrank fro-n abolishng a sn [e
solitary v«can' clerkship, ¡tad if they cannot spare
one clerk f¡ mi o lar^e a bureau as this, where, I
ask, are they to carry out th ir principles of reforrr'!
Tney have told the people that the expenses of the
Government were too ?reat. I have no doubt tnat
mar>y believed tnem, and have decreed a reduction
of expenditures Let gendemen now redeem their
pledges  o the people Let ihem begin soneichsre,
and tney will find 'ho-e here who wil' ad them ¡a
carrying out ihe principles of economy and reform
on the most enlaiged and liberal scale
Mr. EVANS rose to a question cf order The
amendment proposed to alter the feei alio ¿ed by the
exis in* 'aw, and was, to tnat extent, a rep al of the
law. The proviso, as reported in the bill, did not
alter the change for fees, but this amendment di-i.
He considered it irregular and unusual, and put it
to the Chair whether the proposition to amend
could be admitted.
The CHAIR observed that if this were an origi-
nal proposition to insert such a proviso m the bill,
he would have no heiitaticn in ruling it out of or-
der. Bat though the proviso m the bill was irregu-
lar, yet the Chair could have no control over it,
inasmuch as it had been reported by the Committee
of Ways and Means, and entertained by the
House Therefore, the proviso being m he bill
it was competent to amend or perfect the same)
although it might go to change an existing law.
Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi, m pursuance
of notice givtn, then submitted bis amendment, as
follows
Strike out, in the eighteenth and nineteenth
pages of the bill, that part relating to the district
attorneys, clerks, and marshals, respectively, and
insert
"That heieafter, mheu of all fees, emoluments, and receipts,
now allowed, it shall anl may be lawful for the United States
clerks, attorneys counsel, and marshals, in the district and cir
cult coutts oi the United Mates in the several Estates, to demand
and leoeive the same fees that now are, or hereafter may be,
allowed by the laws of the said States respectively where said
courts are held, to the Gleiks, attorneys and counsel and she
riffs, in the highest courts ol the said States m which like ser-
vices ale lendeied, and no other fees or emoluments, except
that the marshals shall receive in full, for summoning all ihe
juroisforany onecouit, tlur y dollars, and shall receive, for
every day's actual attendance at any court, five dollars perday,
and lor any services, including the compensation for mileage,
perfoimed by said officers m the discharge of their ofBcialduty,
loi which no compensation is provided by the laws of said
States, respectively, the said officers may receive such fees as
are now allowed by law according to the existing usage and
practice of said courts of the United States, anil every district
attorney, except the district attorney of the southern district of
New Yo-k shall leceive, in addition to the above fees, a salary
of two hundred dollars por annum "
After some inci lenial remarks by Messrs.

of Mississippi, and WELLER,

of the Chair.
