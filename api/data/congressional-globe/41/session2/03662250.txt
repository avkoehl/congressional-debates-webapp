Mr. GILFILLAN. Mr. Chairman, Penn-
sylvania and her interests seem to be the target
for the shafts of the free-traders upon the floor
of this House. Tire gentleman from Ohio aud
New York [Mr. Cox] lias just ventilated his
pet theory upon the subject of free trade, illus-
trating the same with numerous biblical quo-
tations. I have just been placed in possession
of a copy of a paper called the Exchange,
under date of the 2-lth instant., published at
New York in the interests of British manu-
facturers and in opposition to American free
labor, which so faithfully and fully reflects the
ideas of the gentleman, and is couched iu lan-
guage and metaphor so very similar t6 his, that
1 cannot forbear asking the Clerk to read the
same for the information of the House, and for
the purpose of saving the gentleman the neces-
sity of publishing that portion of his remarks.
Mr. Chairman, I do notwishto occupy much
time of the committee or of this House, or to
undertake to make an exhaustive argument
upon all or many of the points involved in this
bill. But I do desire to say a few words in
reference to the proposed duties on some of the
articles mentioned in the bill, and particularly
upon those affecting the interests of my owu
constituents. The bill as reported by the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means is preferable in some
respects to the law as it now stands, particu-
larly in respect to the enlargement of the free
list by articles not produced in our own country.
But, sir, I prefer that the present duty on
pig iron should not be disturbed. I have the
honor to represent one of the large iron-
producing and manufacturing districts of my
State, and know something of the cost of manu-
facturing pig iron in the Shenango valley of
Pennsylvania. Some gentlemen on this floor
representing purely agricultural communities
entertain very exalted ideas 'of the munificent
profits and princely fortunes acquired by the
iron manufacturers of Pennsylvania and else-
where. But, sir, if they could know the for-
tunes that have been lost by men of enterprise
iu attempting to develop those great resources
of wealth they would be less dazzled by these
princely fortunes they so eloquently portray.
It costs, sir, in that enterprising and thrifty
valley of the Shenango Soli 57 per ton to man-
ufacture and deliver pig iron by rail in Pitts-
burg, a distance of sixty miles. It commands
in that market $GG 24, leaving only $2 07
profits, to say nothing of the interest on the
large amounts of capital invested. To any
one acquainted with the business this will be
regarded as very moderate profits, aud not in
excess of other branches of trade. Reduce
the duty $2 per ton, as proposed in this bill,
and you strike down at once some 28 large
iron manufactories in that portion ol'the State,
or if not, you take that amount from the
hands and mouths of the honest sons of toil
who produce this wealth, and thus turn them
one step backward toward the degrading prices
of labor in Europe. And, sir, what is true of
this locality is true of almost all the mining
and manufacturing localities of the country.
A protective tariff, Mr. Chairnjan, is essen-
tial in protecting the labor and developing our
resources in this country. One of the first
and greatest difficulties against which our revo-
lutionary ancestors had to contend was the
want of protection from the importations of
British goods and manufactures. So well were
they convinced of the doctrine and necessity of
protection that they organized what was called
the " non-importation agreement," which was
signed by every member of the first Congress
that convened at Philadelphia in 1774. At the
close of the war in 1783 the influx of foreign
goods proved disastrous to the mechanical and
manufacturing industry of the country. Thus
our revolutionary fathers wore compelled to
protect their industry by voluntary associations
and by appeals to the patriotism of the people
till, in 1787, the adoption of the Constitution
came to their relief. Within a week after the
assembling of Congress under the new Con-
stitution Mr. Madison presented to Congress
the recommendation for a protective tariff as
one of the most important measures requiring
their attention.
It does seem strange, Mr. Chairman, that
any one should propose a reduction of the
tariff at this time. How do gentlemen sup-
pose it practicable for manufacturers to pay
the present prices for labor without the aid of
a protective tariff? Why, sir, labor is now
about 50 per, cent, higher than before the
war. As I have already shown, the profits on
the manufactures of iron are now merely nom-
inal, and therefore even a slight reduction on
the present duties would destroy the iron man-
ufacturers of the country. So it is impossible
to reduce these duties without striking directly
at and reducing labor. This cannot be done
under existing prices in the cost of living.
Mr. Chairman, I have no hesitation in say-
ing that any man or party seeking to break
down protection now does it at the risk of
destroying the manufacturing interests of the
country, and is endeavoring to make Europe
the workshop of America.
Mr. Chairman, wo have a party in this coun-
try which has always opposed protection to
unskilled labor and has been uniformly the
enemy of American labor. It has been a
matter of surprise to me, sir, that so large a
number of the laboring classes in this country
is found in the ranks of a party that has con-
stantly and persistently been the champion of
foreign labor. It has been a matter of surprise
to me, sir, that men of Irish birth in this
country should be found arrayed on the side
of a fiee-trade party. Men who have borne
the English yoke should hesitate before putting
it on in the land of their adoption. Men who
have witnessed the degi*ading effects of an
English policy in Ireland should not ally them-
selves with the friends of British manufacturers
here. But, sir, I think this class of our citi-
zens are beginning to understand this ques-
tion, and willhereafter be found on the side of
protection.
Sir, Ihavejustreceivedamemorialfrom Wil-
liam Blakie, Kobert Campbell, and eighty-four
other citizens of Irish birth residing in my dis-
trict, who handle the pick and shovel, giving
many unanswerable reasons in favor of a protec-
tive and against a mere revenue tariff, which I
desire the Clerk to read for the benefit of the
House, and which I desire to have printed.
The Clerk read as follows :
To the Senate and llouse of Representatives in Congress
it nscmUled;
The uridorsigned, natives of Ireland, citizens, or
havingthc intention to bocome citizens of the United
States, respectfully represent:
That wo regard with deep concern the designs and
efforts made to subvert tho national policy of indus-
trial protection.
That wo have seen with satisfaction the extraor-
dinary progress tho country has made in mateiial
wealth since the adoption of the tariff of 1861, evi-
dence of which is to be found in the following facts :
tho production of coal has increased from 14,000,000
tons in 1860 to about 24.000,000 tons ia 186S: woolen
fabrics from a value of $34,000,000 in 1860 to $274,000,000
in 18G8; the annual product of pig iron from 931,000
tons in i860 to about 2,000,000 tons in 1869; while,
after an exhaustive civil war, theinternal condition
of the United States presents the gratifying prospect
of a considerablo reduction in the public debt, a
largo surplus in tho revenue, the national crcdil
restored, and rapid progress in the construction of
railroads and the development of all our industrial
resources.
That protection has secured the nation diversified
industry, attracted largo immigration, afforded a
remunerative home market for agricultural pro-
ducts, released us from humiliating dependence on
foreign nations, and developed the inventive semus
and capacities of the people, and that its continu-
ance will still further insure these blessings.
That nearly all the great men of the Republic who
are justly held in esteem by their countrymen have
advocated protection to American industry, know-
ing that it alone can advance tho permanent pros-
perity of tje nation and emancipate tho country
irorn the losses entailed by dependence on foreign
market:;.
"We would also represent that in view of the largo
public dent, it is imperative to develop the vast re-
sources ox the couutry and secure remunerative
wages for labor, in ordex* that wo may be enabled to
reduce the puolic debt and fund the remaining
amount at a moderate rate of interest.
J.hat all our staple products are cheaper than at
iormer periods when we mainly depended on foreign
products, while the capital employed in them has
remained m the country to fructify and increase the
general wealth.
That tho^ aggressive warfare on and jealousy of
American industry is mainly on the part of England,
as the other nations produce only such of the great
staples as are required for their own consumption,
and are not dependent for existence upon the sale
oi their products abroad.
That the United States, by continuing to buy from
England j,o the enormous extent of $171,000,000 (gold)
