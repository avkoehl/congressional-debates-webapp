tion was unfavorable to us, I am happy to say that the missiles thrown from their guns did not cause only casualties in the brigade. August 19, at 3.30 a. m. all the batteries of the corps bearing ont he city opened fire, firing fourteen rounds per gun. This was the only important incident of the day. Nothing of any moment transpired until the evening of the 25th, when the brigade was quietly withdrawn from the works and placed en route for Pace's Ferry, on the Chattahoochee River, which point we reached early the next morning. The position taken by the brigade on the 26th was about midway between the railroad bridge and Pace's Ferry. The right held by the One hundred and forty- seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers, rested on a rebel fort which had formerly commanded the approaches to the railroad bridge. Its chief importance in our hands is that from it if in the hands of the enemy the brigade could easily be destroyed by artillery. The Twenty-ninth Ohio Volunteers was posted on the left of the One hundred and forty- seventh Pennsylvania Volunteers. These two regiments were posted in front of the remainder of the brigade and fully commanded the cleared ground in their front, over which the enemy must pass to gain a position from which serious injury could be done the various bridges over the river at the railroad crossing. The remainder of the command was posted on a range of hills in rear of the positions held by the regiments previously mentioned and wee holding a line which considerably attenuated the command in order to connect it with the Second Brigade, Second Division, Twentieth Corps, on the left. Each regiment this day and the days following until the 2nd of September were engaged in fortifying their positions and slashing the timber in their front, so as to make the position held by the troops as nearly inaccessible as possible.

On the 2nd of September, in compliance with instructions from the general commanding division, the Twenty- eighth Pennsylvania Volunteers and Sixty- sixth Ohio Volunteers were placed in position to cover the road bridge at Pace's Ferry and its approaches, occupying the works of the Third Brigade, Second Division, Twentieth Army Corps; the Fifth Ohio Volunteers was also deployed to cover the ground previously occupied by the Second Brigade, Second Division, Twentieth Army Corps. In this position we remained until September 4, when, in compliance with orders, the brigade moved into the city of Atlanta and went into position in the works constructed for the defense of the town, the left of the brigade at a fort near the race- course and extending along the rebel works to a point near where the road leading to Turner's Ferry passes through the fortifications. In this position the brigade is now resting, performing only the necessary picket and camp duties.

Appended to this report please find a list of the casualties i the brigade from the 8th of May to the 4th of September, 1864.* I take pleasure in calling your attention to the acknowledgment of Colonel Charles Candy to members of the staff, and beg leave to add my testimony to their efficiency and worth. Accompanying this please find reports of regimental commanders.
