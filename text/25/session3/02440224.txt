POSTMASTER'S EXPLANATION.
Mr. ALLEN submitted the following resolu-
tion:
Resolved, That the President's message, of the 1st in-
stant, and the accompanying letter of the Postmaster Gen
erai, in answer to certain resolutions of the Senate adopted
on the 1st mstant, in relation to a communication previously
made to the Senate by the Postmaster General, are satis
factory to the Senate                                     •
Mr A desired the consideration of the reso-
lution at this time; but, this requiring the unan-
imous consent of the Senate,
Mr SMITH, of Indiana, objected
Mr. BUCHANAN expressed a hope that the
Senator from Indiana [Mr Smith] would with-
draw his objection The Postmaster General had
expressly disclaimed all intentional disrespect to
the Senate in his former communication He
had never believed, and he had so expressed him-
self, that this officer intended any disrespect to
the body, although, without this disavowal, his
communication would fanly bear such a con
Btruction He had now disavowed all such in-
tention, and therefore the Senate ought to express
themselves satisfied
Mr SMITH still persisting in his objection,
the resolution was laid upon the table
Mr ALLEN then said that by the rules he
could call up his resolution to morrow, and that
as the day would terminate at twelve o'clock, he
gave notice that he would take the earliest occa-
sion thereafter to call for its consideration

The Senate pioceeded to consider the bill fiom

The amendment was ncgitived without a divi-
sion

The appropriations of #740,000 for fortifications
and other military defenses on the Atlantic and
Gulf coast were now taken together, advocated
by Mr BENTON and Mr DAVIS, who stated
that there was recently not a gun at Boston in a
condition to fire a salute, which he supposed was
generally the case, and opposed by Mr CAL
HOUN, who said there weie always ready guns
by hundreds when he was connected with the
Department, and if the millions recently appro-
priated had been thus wasted, this pittance Would
do nothing., and then this whole appropriation was
negatived, by yeas and nays, as follows

POSTMASTER GENERAL'S EXPLANATION
The resolution submitted by Mr Allent, rela-
tive to the letter of the Postmastei General, was,
on his motion, called up and agreed to, without a
division
MAINE BOUNDARY QUESTION.
The bill from the House giving to the President
of the United States additional powers for the
defense of the United States in certain cases
against invasion, and for other purposes, was re
ceived, the 16th joint rule in the way of its recep-
tion was suspends d, and the Senate proceeded
forthwith to consider the bill After having been
read the first time,
Mr BENTON observed that he did not think
it necessaiy, at this late period of the session,
and under present circumstances, to refer this bill
to a committee The subject was perfectly un-
derstood by every Senatoi, the bill, as it had
passed the House, was on then tables, and the
sense of the Senate had been fully expressed m
the resolutions unanimously adopted last evening
He therefore thought that they had better not
icftr the bill, but take it up m Committee of the
Whole, and act on it at once
Mr BUCHANAN observed that the bill from
the House, now before the Senate, entirely met
Ins approbation, with perhaps a single exception
Undci all the ur< iimstanccs, he doubted the policy
of sending a special minister to England, but he
should make no motion to strike this piousion
ftom the bill, unless his doubts might bo foitified
by tlu opinion of othei Senators    With this ex
oeption, if sudi it ought to be considered, the
bill, In   believed, was just  such a one as the
Committee  on   I oitign   Relations   would   have
unanimously report! d to the Senate, hid it not
been deemed moie propei that this measuie should
otigmatt in the Housi      It v. is precisely m ac-
ioidance with the lcsoliitions which had passed
the Si nitt last night, by which we pledged our
selves, that in case the British Government should
| attempt to take possession of this disputed tern
' toiy, we should stmd by tlu  President of the
| United States, and sustain him with all the mih-
I tary powti of the nation in íepellmg this aggres-
1 sion     11ns bill contained no provisional aimy
' It simply authorized a resort to the militia and
j volunteers, in case it should become necessary to
I call out a militaiy foice befoie Congiess could be
convened, and appropriated the money necessary
j to accomplish the object     Mi    B   agreed with
I his fueiid from Missouri, [Mr   Eeston,] that it
w is unnecessary to refer this bill to a committee,
as it was plain and simple in its provisions, and
■ the session so neai its close     As to the propn
ety of sending a special mimstei to England, he
would be glad to hear the opinion of other Sena-
tors on this subject
Mr PALLMADGL observed that he differed
with the Senatoi from Pennsylvania m one par
ticulai He was highly m iavor of sending a
special minister to England He thought the
minister sent should be a man of chatacttr and
standing, and he had no idea that the Piesident
would send any othei
Mr SOUTHARD acknowledged that he felt
great difficulty in passing so promptly on a bill
of such magnitude He did not view it ¡n the
light that other Senators did, as carrying out the
resolutions of the Committee on Foreign Relations,
but going far beyond them He greatly feared
the consequences of passing such a bill, and was
alarmed at what would be the result of its pas-
sage For if it did pass, and the President should
call for the volunteers authorized by it, there
would be a war between this country and Great
Britain which might last for years Where were
these volunteers to be raised, and how ? The
moment (said Mr S ) that this bill is passed, you
will find volunteers assembling und«r it, and eager
to march into the British territories
Now, I ask you to look upon the whole of our
frontiers, and see what has occurred there during
the past twelve months, together with the tone
and temper of the people Did it not requne all
the exertions of the Executive to repress the
spirit that was so openly manifested - He would
as soon vote for an absolute declaration of war as
this bill The great danger was that the volun-
teers would not wait for the orders of the Piesi-
dent of the United States, but that they would,
as soon as organized, invade the British territory,
and thus bring on a war while the two Govern-
ments were in the progiess of adjusting the dif-
ferences between them There were other pro-
visions of this bill to which he was not prepared
to give his assent, and there were otheis which
he approved of, and among the latter was the one
referred to by the Senator from New York He
hoped that a special minister would be sent to
England, and that the mission would íesultin the
settlement of all our differences with that Power
God forbid that a war between this country and
England, the representatives of the fieedom of
the world, should ever take place He did not
feai the contest, if it should be forced on him,
but (said he) if we go into this conflict, I wish
to go into it coolly and dispassionately, and in a
manner calculated to carry with us the feelings
of the people of the whole countiy He pie-
ferred that the bill should be sent to a committee,
with a view to a more mature consideration of
the whole subject, and the recommendation of
some measure less calculated to precipitate the
country into a wai In the present posture of
affairs, this section authorizing the raising of vol
untecis, would be looked on by the British Gov-
ernment in no othei light than as a menace, and
peihaps lead this high spuited people into acts
of hostility, which moie modeiate measures on
our part might prevent How could we expect
any successful negotiations for terminating our
diffeitnces with the Bntish Government, with
this threat hanging ovei them ' Would they not
point to it as an act of hostility, and refuse to
negotiate until it was withdrawn >
Mr S , aftei some fuither remaiks, concluded
by moving to refi i the bill to the Committee on
foieign Relations
Mi I"4LLMADGE did not know that he had
any objections to the reference of the bill, the re-
maik he made was in ugard to the sending of a
mimstei But he saw no cause foi the alarm felt
by the Senator from New Jersey No one could
pretend that volunteeis would be raised under the
provisions of this bill till the Piesident called for
I them, and after he has called for them, they will,
. as soon as raised, be in the service of the United
States, and cannot go to Canada, or anywhcio
I else, without ordeis He could not agree with
| the Senator fiom New Jersey that any pait of this
bill could justly be viewed as a threat or menace
Wi have been threatened with invasion, and,
though he did not believe that the threat would
be carried into execution, yet it was highly neces-
saiy lo be piepared for any such contingency
Should the Bntish Government complain of this
clause oí the oil! as a menac , which he did not
believe they would do, the President could say,
that from the very n ituro of our institutions, we
weie unprepared for any emeigency, and then
foie it was that Congress passed this measuie in
older that we might be piepared to meet the in
vasion that was threatened We shall always
enter into a conflict with t foreign Power under
disadvantageous circumstances, but we shall be-
come strongei as itpiogresscs, and triumph in the
end He did believe that this bill was necessaiy,
and he would therefore give it his vuti Wc
passed  (said   he) unanimously  the i evolutions
