Repeal of Independent Treasury—Mr. Shields.
II. of Reps.
called the distress of the country. Every such at-
tempt will be like tbe act of ptunng an additional
quan*ity of water in a vessel already full and over-
flowing, all that you pjur m v.ul ran over, and,
in a great measure, be wasted Sir, yon may co< -
vert the Federal Government into a vast system ot
federal banking; you may make your vast public
domain, your custom-house revenue, and all other
sources  of revenue, the foundation of an immense
public debt—an immpnse ma", of public stocks to
be exchanged for banking capital, the Stale Legis-
latures may do the same with the State Govern
ment=, and the resources of their people, until,
finally, the whole spuit and mind of th" peop'e
shall become engrossed and absorbed by bank in-
fluence, and ihe sp°ctaele presented to the world of
a stupendous system ct governmert and popular
bank machinery unequalled and unknown hereto
fore- still the wise man will laugh at your folly,
the rresistible operations oi trade will undermine
your edifice, and the eternal principles of justice
and equity do away the work ot your hands
It is a wise provision of the moral law, that no
man shall be entitled to the goods of another, un-
less by the exchange of an equivalent, and to get
this equivalent, the energies of labor and industry
mu't be brought into requisition Th* amount of
money to which each member of <="eiety is enti-
tled, is to be de ermined by the amoun' if the p o-
ducts of his labor and industry Tbe pursuit of
labor and mdus'ry ma^es valuuble member-, of
society, ameliorates the condition of n,an, makes
man the friend of man, and elevates h m in the
eyes of his Maker
The same rule is equally [applicable to nations
or communities One community is not entitled
to ihe money or property of another, without the
exchange of an equivalent. To get that equiva
ten', the productive energies of such community
must be brought into requisition, and thus it ap
pears lhat the amount ol money which cnmmuo -
ties are entitled to, must depend upon the atrount
ot Ihe aggregate product of their labor ,md indus-
try, and not upon banking systems or bank finan-
ciering It is írdeed, a lappy and wise law, that
nations, as well a« individuals, should pay such a
price for money The encouragement a id prac-
tice of laoor and mt'ustry tend to make Stales
wealthy, powerlul, and prosperous—'o e'eva e
them in the scale of nations—and wield an ame
lioratmg influence upon all commumtirs with
which they maintain social or commercial inter-
course
If the currency of a country consul in tie paper
of specie-paying bank',  ind its amount be exces
sive, a reduction nil talt" piac* by a return of  he
paper upon the banks for re femp ion 11 slfcic,
which will be export!d abroad    II i cnsis  in '•■e
paper of non specit paying banks and  be eices
sive in amount, the redact en will talee plac by i
depreciation in  me valine of sucn paper    It i
plain, ihen, mat trade will, in. spite of legisa
uon and batik financiering, nam and determire ihe
amount and value of the curreLcy employed in the
business of every community    Banks may for a
while, and often do,   by their   misniinagem nt
s ímulatc, confuse,  or e   oarrass the operations of
trade, but finally ihey are compelled to yield obe
dience to its laws
It may be supiosed tint tbe Ba^k which it is
mw proposed to e^tab) sh, in corsequence of the
greater value and higher ciedit of the paper it ma>
issue, wi 1 be enabled to torce the pap r of >hc
State banks out of oi tuiauon, aid substitute us
own Buf, sir, it will be precisely for that reason
that the Bank will fail mitsalempt It its paper
be more valuable than the notes of S ate banks m
the South and We t, n wi'l be bousbt up as rapilly
as it may be j«sjed, ju<t as bills of exchange
are, by merchants brocéis tra Icrs, ana country
banks, for purposes of remittance to the North and
East, in payment of the commercial debt snd
bank balances e"a? in those ^eet o"s of tne Union
It can never circu'ate among ih  mass of the peo-
ple in the Souih or W- st, or any other section of
the Union, until the sol/ent loctl banks in those
sections resume «¡pee e payments When they re-
sume specie payments, their paper will be at par,
or nearly at par, with ths paper of the National
Bank, and then both will circulate through the
same channel , unti 1 some chati"  Ukes plsc3 ten
(Wing the one mor valuad" than th  ether, n
which event, to.<> circula i n of tbe more vaiuab e
of the two uiill diminish, whilst that of the odier uul
increase
And now, Mr Speaker, perm't me to ask the
question—Is it not true beyond dispute, that there
can be no restoration of the cu'rency of the coun-
try until the S ate banks, whose paper now fil s the
channels of circulation, resume specie pigments
or finally wind up their affair ^, and oiake room for
a better currency to flow in' Surely, sir, >■< re'y
such is the truth. But the S a'e bank  cannot
resume specie pavmen s until their debtors are
able to pay the debts due them Tin e dtb ors
cannot piy the immense mans of d^bt due the
banks, until b> dint of labDr, industiy, and econo-
my, and Ihe collecti n of e!ebts due themselves
from others, they a e « .abled to realiz  tbe m ans
of liqui'atmn Thi, we recur again to t ¡e on 1/
available remedy toi all tne evils cfthe daj—o
wi', time, libor, industry, and economy The rigid
exercise cf thi-e pains is th= price of our redemp-
tion from ih  curse of a spuuous currency and
the humiliating bondage of debt
But, sir, we need a gmde, a standird, around
'thioh the honesty, the mo'al virtue, the frugahtj,
labor, ecoTomy, and sound credit of the country,
may rally in conducting the great wcrk ef delivei-
ance Where sha 1 we find it? Where saall we
plant it? Whoee duty is it to rear up and main-
tain the speciestandard of value—to fly the specie
das'2 Is it mt the pecul arconsti utional dutv of
this Government to recognise nothing as currency
but gold and silver? Gold and silver is made by
the Constitution the currency of the people, it is the
only legal tender m the payment ot debts Who
can deny the eVy of this Government te pro ect,
preserve, ind defend it, b< all the means within
th const ui nal hnil of iispivrr? And low
elsp, p*"i tin o asic can ill •> duty be o tt r
dischaiged hi.ii by an exclusive me, in all of its
fiscal opeiatim , of the ill ng itself! Sir, it is lei e
to dispute upon th's pomt, it is ti ne lhat we sVmld
lay isile the mawkish ensibilitt , the feni nine
tears and hes tation with wh eh polit oi 'us have
approached, and ihe puMie mm 1 beict fir" beer
a'armed in relation to ihis subject Let the fnth
b' told, and firmIj told wi boa'crncealm nt or
disguise
It is imio sible that the Government cvn dis-
charge it elf from the re p n'lbi1 ty impose 1 by
the Constitution, by transferring to binu directors
the hi"h sivreign authority of making currency
fir the penpl , of expelling the g-1 d andsiHer
c ins ot the Constitution from circulation, and
subcti a ns m 'heir ste'd a frail and uncertain
paper siandard A di'ect and posi ive adoption of
I ose coins as ihe exclu i re medium of at' its fiscal
dealings—as lie prefeirei and b'lter currency—is
rpqu re i by tbi injunctions of the C nstitut on p id
the interests ol th1 country The effect or si ch a
policy will be to mere se tbe s'ock u he p ecious
metals retained in the country for rer.nanen' use,
to enlarge ihe basis of sound credit, and menease
the «olichty of soivent banks
The reciu sit'on of specie from the wealth/ im-
port ng me clnnt, in payment of duties will cause
him to rej ct all paper from the whole ale mer-
chant, in paiment of goods soil to him, but such
is may be eqtv1 e"t <o and eonvrlib e into spec e
Th s will can he whol «ale merchant io -efuse

plying bailas from i'e jebVr or re ail meicoant,
and, in tern, "?i.5e him <o refuse all bin tr° me

of the people, will soon find it to their interest todis-

«ir, is the tendency e f things at thi^ moment. The
difference in value b tween the paper of sp cie-
paying banks si d non-spoci° pay ng banks H a¡~
rea !y establ bed n ihe market places of tec coun-

that it is of no advantage to them to receive hi¿h

Ii is true that ih? depreo a ion of the currency
has operated heretofore, and peihapsat this time
operates, as a veiy considerable relief to the deb or
classes in many pans of the Union, and e pecially
in the Sta e whrh I hav  the honor m part to re-
present here The cotton planter in Alabama who
has |10,000 worth of cnton for <ale in Mobile is
enabled to '•ell it for $11,000, m conseqjen>-e of the
ten or twelve p°r cen* deprecia ion of the paper
whicn he receives in payment, and this paper will
pay hi debts in hank, and, for tbe most part,
a n ngst his neigbors it pur His means of pay-
in his deb s are Ihu inc ea ed ten per cent or to
tbe extent of the de-prrciati' n of the paper received
by him for his co ton The same may be «aid in
¡egard to tobacco planters, sugar grower , gram
growers, and all o'hers similarly situu'ed But
thes  old debts w<U scon be liquidated, and then
there will cease to be a mo'ive tor the further con-
tinuation or countenance if this condition of ihe
currency Indeed, it mav now be said that there
are but few seen ns of th  Union in which the de-
preciated condition of the ci'rrenc/ at t! s time
opera'es t" a rel ef orbeiefit in ¿ny wise lo any por-
t on of the co nmani y except he b inks, and there-
lcre, befne the c ntracts or trade of tiecommu-
m y are entered lito, or predicated upon the basis
ot a depreciated currency or deoisect standard of
value, it behooves all parties to uni'e m one grand
un versal effort to res ore and maintain the sound-
ness of the currency
But U is said thai ihe practical operations of trie
Independent Irea^ury system will create a de-
mand for the preciom metals to supply Government
