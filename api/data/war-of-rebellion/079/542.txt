Brigadier General Charles Cruft is assigned to the command of the convalescents of the Fourteenth, Fifteenth, Seventeenth, and Twentieth Army Corps sent back to Chattanooga by Major-General Sherman from the army in the front. Brigadier-General Cruft will organize the convalescents of each corps into a brigade, each brigade representing the corps to which the troops composing it belong. He will also organize his staff from among the convalescent officers sent back with the troops. The command will be reported to Major-General Steedman, commanding District of the Etowah, for duty in defending the posts of Chattanooga and Bridgeport and intermediate points.

By command of Major-General Thomas:

NASHVILLE, TENN., October 31, 1864-8 a. m.

Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER, Decatur:

Do not send any more re-enforcements to Athens, except the artillery you mention in your dispatch. Send 300 men or a regiment to Lamb's Ferry with plenty of ammunition and five days' provisions to relieve a guard that General Croxton has at that place. You must not let the rebels cross the river between Whitesburg and Decatur. The great majority of Stanley's troops will undoubtedly reach Athens to-day.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

DECATUR, October 31, 1864-11. 10 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

As soon as transportation can be furnished I will forward to Athens all the re-enforcements to me, referred to in your previous telegram. General Stanley is now at Athens in position with Wood's DIVISION.
