Captain S. E. PITTMAN,A. A. G., First Div., Twelfth Army Corps:

CAPTAIN: In compliance to circular from division headquarters, October 14, 1863, I have the honor to submit the following report of the state of defenses:

At Cowan there are two stockades and one field-work, with ample supplies of wood and water, and with six day's commissary stores.

At this point (Decherd) I find stockades and rifle-pits covering the water-flank and trestle-work; these are the only defenses.

At the tunnel no works have as yet been erected, but stockades will be built to cover the shafts as soon as the entrenching tools (for which requisitions have been made) arrive.

The country around these points affords no cover for the enemy.

A detailed report will be forwarded as soon as the reports from the post commanders at Cowan and the tunnel are received.

Very respectfully,

JOS. F. KNIPE,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Post.
