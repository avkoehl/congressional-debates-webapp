The ford at Pack's Ferry was too high for crossing yesterday. How far is it from you? McClellan is within 8 miles of Richmond. Movements promise well in the Southwest.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

SIR: I have received your note of this date* in reference to the President's order of Sunday last relative to the gunboats on the Rappahannock.

The President desired that one vessel should be sent to Fredericksburg to defend the bridge there. Captain Wyman, commanding the flotilla, was here this morning, and reports one vessel stationed as directed and two or three others below plying up and down the river.

Captain Wyman leaves this afternoon for the flotilla, and I beg leave to ask if any arrangement different from the above is desired.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. V. FOX,
