CIRCULAR, HDQRS. THIRD DIVISION, FOURTH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 16. New Market, East Tenn., March 22, 1865.

The general commanding desires to call the attention of the command to the fact that we are now in a country inhabited, in a great majority, by loyal people, and the practice heretofore prevailing of using fence rails for fuel purposes must be discontinued, as these people cannot raise crops for their own maintenance if their fences are destroyed, and the Government will have to ship provisions here for their support. Parties sent out for wood must cut the wood, and under no circumstances will the fences or buildings of loyal citizens be allowed to be disturbed or destroyed.

By command of Major-General Wood:

M. P. BESTOW,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

Quartermasters of the First, Second, and Fourth Divisions will immediately move all Government property from the right bank of the river to Eastport, Miss., applying to Captain Warren, assistant quartermaster, for transportation. All detachments of the First, Second, and Fourth Divisions will report to these headquarters.

Major-General STONEMAN,

Knoxville:

Your telegram of yesterday received. I have directed Colonel Mackay, chief quartermaster, Army of the Cumberland, to go to Knoxville, where he can overlook and regulate all matters pertaining to the quartermaster's department. You can communicate with him about all matters in his department, and save the time necessary to communicate with General Donaldson. Of course, I wish you to husband your horses and men as much as possible until you can get into Virginia, where your hard work will commence.
