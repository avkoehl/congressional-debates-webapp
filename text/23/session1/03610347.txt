Mi L contended at length that the Postmaster
General had no light to employ cleiks, wi hout
authority of law These cleiks, in his opinion,
were unnecessary numeiou«, and many ot them,
he said, weie as useless to the depaument as its
Q1 1 mail bags He wished to know whatweiethe
employments of all these cleiks Ht had offeied
a resolution tormeily, which the House was lot
disposed to entertain, inquiring what wete tl e du
ties of these cleiks seveially, and how they weie
paid He was aware hat the rejec ion of th s ap-
piopriatton would net aiTec the clerks themselves,
¡oi they had been paid He wished to know where
the Postmaster General got the money Let us
know if the Postmaster Genera! takes the discre-
tion of multiply ing ofiieeis as he pieasts, and of
convening the ¡undo of tne department to this pur- I
pose, and then applies to this Hoi se to extucate
him from his difficulties Mr L said the depait-
ment wasfiom frouO.ÜOOto #1 COÜ.OOO m debt He
w is warranted in saying that it had borrowed
$300,000 fiom banks, had oveidiawn on deposites
§150,000, and was gieatly indebted to mail con-
Ua<-tois To the Uisciedit of the n ition, the con-
tracto s were every day supplicating paymeru, and
were driven away, by threats that their claims, if
they coot nued then importui ity, should be bal
snced in forfeituies, for failing to comply wi h the
teims of their cot tiaets Ti ey wre also threat- '
eued with the lossrf then contiact itself fi, the
Postmaster Genenl made a most <onven ent pro- |
vision in all his contracts, that tnev should be
discortmued at his pleasuie These tacts he chal-
lenged any one to deny
Mi   POPt observed, that he was as ready as
any oí e to entei into a full examination ot thede

an expiession that hi 1 fallen on yes erday fiom
his colleague, [Vh    Hardiv ]    Thst gentleman
had stated thatoneof the clerkuin the Depaument
[Mi   Lolchj orot ch] held, he susp-ctcd, a sine
cure office      He did not know the duties of that
cleik      Mr   Barry and that clerk once puctised
law n Ken'ucky, in conjunction, buthe would not
say hatthiswpsthectraseofhisappomtment    Mr
P  said, he regretted that h.s honorable cilleagje
hid so expies&ed himself, because it ai peaied j
to be a covet t insinuation, calculated to mane an .
unfavorable impression on the public mmd     He
hoped his colleague intend ed to make no prejudicial
insinuation, because he must be awaie that that
clerk was a gentleman of gieat worth, and as inca-
pable of re< eiving, as was the Postmaster General
of granting, a sinecure office He had understood,
in lact the chairman of the Cimmmee on the Post
Oíli e and Post Roads had just informed the com-
mittee, that the gentleman alluded to was now
absent on official duty
Mr P concluded by stating that Mr Barry, in
this matter, only puisucd the steps of Mr. Mc-
Lean , that the business of the department had
greatly increased, and that, consequently, more
cleikb werereqjited to dischaige the duties of the
depaument, which necessarily mci eased its ex-
penses He oonsideied the desired appiopnation
justa^d piopei.and should, therefore, vote for it
Mr LINCOLN said he had not impugned the
coneetncs of the conduct of the PostmasterGen-
e al He diatmc 1} disclaimed any charge upon
the Postmaster General He supposed that he
was led into error by misrepresentations
Mi RLCD had no accusation, he said, to make
against the head of the Post Office Department
But the question was, is tne depaument well man-
aged ' He was constrained to say that it was not
well managed He knew that it could not pay us
debts to t^e contractors
Mr PARKER did not wish to take up the time
of the committee by following the gentleman from
Massachusetts, but he felt compelled to notrce
some of his remarks He complains of the num-
ber of insignificant post offices, and requires that
the mails should go on the direct and principal
routes He would stop the sti earns of information,
v hich, through these channels, flow to the people.
Though the levenue of some of these offices was
but twenty five cents, yet then expenses only con-
sisted m thefo'dingup newspapers and tying them
up The question befoie the committee is, whether
we shall make any allowance for expenses of the
P st Ofii t net aiunonzed by a ptevious law'
Non , he would undeitake to say that we had no
express law., yet we had precedents which bound
us to mal e the ippropnition asked foi He went
bark as far asl8b6,and showed tnat by an act then
pissed, ce'tani piovision was made foi clerks in
the Post Olice Depanmc-t, ai d m the yeai 1809,
the approj mtion act provided afurthei sum to pay
foi cleiks employed m addition to those authorised
by the act of lb06 He íeferred to many other
similar acts ts precedents for this
Mi EVAlNt> spoke in fivor of the mo'ron to
s nke ou', and wished thnt gentlemen should be
suffered, on this flooi,to cxpiess their dissatisfac-
tion at the administration ot puohc affairs, with-
out be ng repioved for making a personal attack
upon public t fiLeis It was, he contended, ad-
mitted that the Post Office Department was m a
deianged t ate It was admitted in the report ot
the Postmas el Ge end himself The gentleman
frim \1 is achusetts e*cased the Poslmistei Gen-
eral on the supposition that he ai ted upon misiep-
rtse i ition <t ficts He cou d point out some
irs anees in uh ch he ' nevi that the Postmaster
General was deceived He ins'anced the appoint-
ment of Norto i to t! e post office of old Hartford,
vvliith vies -evoked in a few days aftei it was
made H^ went on tj point out what he con-
sideied as mismanagement on the part of the Post
Office
Mr POLK went m'o p full sta'ement of the
foimei cou-se m regaid to tne employment ot
clerks in the Post Office Department The con
stant giowth cf the business of the depaument
íendered ¡t necessary continually to mcreise the
number of the clerks In consequence of this, the
actuil appropriations before the end of the yeai,
fell short of the necessary expenses of the depau-
ment, and for moie than fifteen years, it had been
customaiy for the Postmaster Genera! to employ
additional clerks, when they wete wanted, and
rely upon Cong'e s subsequent'y to provide for
the experse He did not considei it proper or
peitinei t, while cons dermg this clause, to go into
a full view ot the v/hole admimsiiation of he Post
Office Mr P said he thought the fault was in
Congiess He thought tl at Congiess ought to
cieate by law a sifficient and ample force for the
depar'ment, ,n anticipation of its necessities He
was willing io do this now But the course adopted
by Mi Bairy was justified by j lecedent and law.
