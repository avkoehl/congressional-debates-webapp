FARMINGTON, May 9, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK:

The movements of the enemy to-day have shown them to be in great force. I think there were certainly 30,000 men in front to-day when our forces retired. This army is exposed on the right. There is 2 1/2 or 3 miles between Pope's right and Buell's left. This gap ought to be closed by another division to-night, if possible, or by moving Buell's division in this direction until they connect closely with Pope. The enemy will probably remain in our front to-night and mass forces for general attack tomorrow; if they do, a strong effort may be made by them to isolate this force.

Assistant Secretary of War.

General BUELL:

You will make every effort tomorrow morning to close up the space between you and General Pope, and to protect his right in case of an attack. If General Wood is moved to the left, his position will be occupied by General Thomas' old division.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General.

THOMAS A. SCOTT, in Field:

General Buell has been ordered to support Pope's right tomorrow, and the space left by Buell's right will be filled by one of Thomas' divisions. Don't let Pope go too far ahead; it is dangerous, and effects no good.

Major-General.

Major-General BUELL:

Enemy is forming pretty strong line of battle at Farmington, having driven in our pickets. Please march Nelson's division in this direction immediately and be ready.

JNumbers POPE,

Major-General.

BUELL'S HEADQUARTERS,

May 9, 1862.

General HALLECK:

I have sent two divisions over to support Pope's right flank, information having come to me that our pickets have been driven in at Nichols' Ford. If the enemy appears there in force I shall move my whole command there, as any success of the enemy which would intercept my
