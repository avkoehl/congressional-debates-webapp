General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: Yesterday I worked two brigades on our new lines, and completed the bridge-head across the run and the large battery south of the Vaughan road, destroyed our old breast-work, and had a good deal of timber slashed. To-day I have 1,000 men at work on the battery north of the Vaughan road in extending our breast-works down the run and making abatis and more slashing. I have also a party working the road from the Wyatt house to the Vaughan road. I have my troops encamped in line of battle, reaching on a line nearly east and west, from Hatcher's Run to the Wyatt house, and all camped in the woods. I hope to have my own report of recent operations in to-morrow morning, but will have to do so without waiting for division reports.
