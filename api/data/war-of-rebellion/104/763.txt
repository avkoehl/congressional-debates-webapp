for your command along the route from Cartersville to Chattanooga, if you should receive orders to come back that far. I know your animals must suffer until the grass gets sufficiently manured not to physic them, but I hope the men will take sufficient interest in them to avoid disease as much as possible. In the absence of instructions from Washington, I authorize you to repair the railroad between Atlanta and Etowah bridge, believing that it will have a strong tendency to encourage the people to return to peaceful pursuits, and will also warn them that the Government is not only willing to aid them in their extremity, but prepared to suppress at the outset any further insubordination to the supreme authority of the United States. I have issued instructions to forward a train of wagons with clothing, &amp;c., as asked for by you, as far as Atlanta, after which, should the railroad not be finished, it can be continued for the shipment of such supplies as you will not be able to get from Savannah. Your telegram of the 12th reporting the capture of Jeff. Davis, &c., was received this morning. I take this occasion to express to you, and wish you to convey to your whole command, my entire satisfaction with its operations from the time of its first concentration at this place, on the 2nd of November last, to the present time. They have the proud satisfaction of knowing that they have eminently done their part toward the suppression of this gigantic rebellion and that their deeds will be recorded among the honorable and glorious in the history of their country.

I decline giving any orders in regard to the specie turned over to you by General Palmer. You should not deliver it to any citizen upon mere assertion of ownership. I have no doubt the parties claiming it did own it once, but they should be required to go through all the formalities of proving their property and loyalty. The permit I gave them was simply to bring it here upon the assumption that it was still in their hands. If you choose to send it to my provost-marshal he will give the necessary receipts and I will make such disposition of the funds as the Secretary of War may direct. Let a proper guard come with them.

The guard with our friends will be sufficient, but it might be well to have 100 infantry escort the party to the boat. Colonel Pritchard has three officers and twenty men, besides about twenty in the party and forty men sent from General Upton's command. Refreshments should be ready on the boat and carriages waiting at the depot to carry them to it. Notify me of the arrival and safe departure.
