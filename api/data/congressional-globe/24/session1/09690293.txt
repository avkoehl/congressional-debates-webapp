Surplus Revenue to Fortifications—Mr. Robbins.
Senate.
character' If this was to be one of the conse-
quence of receiving this petition, to his mind it
turmshed an additional reason w hy tlie petition
«honld not be received, for he would not admit
thi anv had the rig-ht to approach that body, and
dcmind. or even to petition, for the adoption of
a measure which it w as admitted that Congress
had no nsht constitutionally to pais- and, upon
this point, he believed there was no diffeienee in
opinion among those representing the southern
section of the Union
But ("aid Mr M ) he had already intimated
that an extraordinary state of excitement pre-
vailed in the section of country from which he
came, connected w ith this subject, and, in con-
firmation of this position, he -would refer to the
numerous public mi etinsrs that had been calkd
by the citizens of the State. He biheved the
people in every populous county had congre-
gated themselves together for the purpose of
adopting such measures as they deemed best cal-
culated to secure their safety, and avert the evils
and dreadful calamity with which they were
threatened b\ the publication of these incendiary
pamphlets. Resolutions hsd been adopted ad-
vising a more rigid discipline over our servants;
patrols recommended to be kept up incessantly
day and night, passes refused to be given in the
usual way, they not permitted to assemble for
the parpóse of holding their own public worship
as usual, and many other measures, looking to
additional restraints upon the comfort and liberty
of the servants themselves, had followed as nat-
ural results from the state of excitement But
(said Mr. M ) this wa<! not all resolutions had
been adopted inv okmg the aid and the action of
the General Assembly upon the subjpct, and the
Genera! Assembly had accordingly acted
A memorial had been adopted by the General
Assembly, addressed to the Legislatures of the
States whence these insurrectionary pamphlets
issued, a copy of which he had the honor of pre-
senting to this body, and which the Senate in-
dulged him in having printed, a copy of which
now lies on each Senator's table. In this, it will
be seen, a most earnest appeal is made to these
legislative bodies, urging the propriety and jus-
tice of legislative enactments to punish the offend-
ers Is more evidence wanting' It would be
found in the correspondence which he had seen
published between the Governor of the State of
Alabama [J Gayle] and the Executive of the
State of New York; wherein it appears that the
former had felt it to be his duty, in accordance
with the oath he had taken to see the laws of the
State faithfully executed, to make a formal de-
mand upon the latter for the surrender of a cer-
tain individual against whom a bill of indictment
had been found by the grand jurors of a respect-
able county, charging him with having wickedly
and maliciously published and circulated these
incendiary publications in that State. It is true,
the Executive of the State of New York made a
very courteous reply to Governor Gayle, declining
a compliance with his command     He refused to
deliver up the celebrated------Williams, publisher
of that notorious and insurrectionary work, upon
constitutional grounds But, (said Mi, M.,) as
the Executive of New York had admitted it was
constitutional for the General Assembly of that
State to pass laws to punish those who might
publish pamphlets calculated to excite rebellion
and insurrection inaslster State, he regretted that,
Khilst the Executive of New York had made the
most liberal professions of kind feelings for the
people of the South, he should have declined to
recommend to the General Assembly over which
he presided, and exercised such a commanding
popularity, the propriety and necessity of legis-
lative enactments to punish the individual whom
he had refused to deliver to the authority of Ala-
bama, and his associates, for the prosecution of
these nefarious and wicked schemes in which they
are engaged, calculated to annoy, and finally to
threaten the peace and safety of the southern
country Mr. M. said he could not doubt, if
such a recommendatien had been made by the
Governor of New York in good faith, that such
enactments would have been passed, and such
would have been more gratifying to the southern
people than mere empty declarations or expres-
sions of friendly feelings; they would then have
had the action of the Executive in confirmation
of his friendly expressions of kind feeling for
the South. He said he regretted that the Gov-
ernor had not embraced the favorable opportunity
that had been afforded him to prove the sincerity
of the declarations so frequently made by north-
ern gentlemen in favor of the southern people, as
connected with this subject
Mr M. said it was not necessary for his pur-
pose that lie should either commend and laud the
Governor of Alabama for the couise he had pur-
sued in relation to this subject, or that he should
censure the Executive of the State of New York
for the manner in which he had thought proper
to discharge his official trust to his constituents.
His object in adverting to this topic was to show
the high state of excitement that pievailed—a
state of public feeling that had scarcely a parallel
at any former period in the history of oui country
Mr M said there were other circumstances
connected with this matter, well calculated to
excite fears that there was something moie in-
tended by the abolition party than met the public
eye He said he had been informed that from
two to three hundred of these petitions had already
been presented to the other branch of the Na-
tional Legislature Many had been presented
here, more than ever had been presented in the
same length of time at any former session, how
many more were yet lying in the table drawers
of honorable Senators, and in the drawers of
members of the other House, waiting a favor-
able moment to be brought forth and presented,
he could not say, nor could he pretend to say
how many of these misguided fanatics were then
industriously engaged in the laudable work of
manufacturing these petitions at the very moment
the Senate woie discussing the propriety of íe-
ceivmg one of them. One thing he did know,
that the number of the petitions had increased,
he was informed the anti-slavery societies had
increased, their exertions had been doubled, and
their assaults trebled of late, upon the District of
Columbia, doubtless for a good reason, m their
opinion, the District may present the most assail-
able point, from its peculiar organization, and
hence, they have concentrated all their force
against the District in the first instance, but his
word for it, give them but ground to stand upon
here, and more than half their object is accom-
plished, for he had formed the delibeiate opinion
that this movement was intended only as an
entering wedge to a great and geneial scheme of
emancipation, that, if encouraged, would be prose-
cuted with a zeal and perseverance that merited
a better cause, into all the slaveholdmg States,
and, entertaining this opinion, he felt it to be his
duty, representing the section of country from
which he came, to vote against receiving the pe-
tition, in order, if possible, to arrest the project
in its incipient stage He thought it was not
only our duty to reject the petition, (or the prayer
of the petition, for he could see little or no differ-
ence,) as the Senator from Pennsvlvama, [Mr
Buchanan,] who introduced it, was willing to do,
but he thought it should be rejected in the most
decisive manner possible—that the seal of dis-
approbation should be put upon the measure in
that stern and emphatic manner that would be
the best calculated to put down this mischievous
pro|ect forever
Mr. Moore said he was glad the honorable
Senator from Virginia to his left [Mr. Tyler]
had introduced a lesolution on this subject which
would not give quite so wide a field for debate.
He understood the resolution presented the single
constitutional point, and negatived the constitu-
tional power in Congress to meddle in any manner
whatever with the relation between slave and mas-
ter in the District of Columbia When this res-
olution shall be discussed, (and he hoped it would
be called up and acted upon very shortly,) Mr.
M. said we should then see who would be willing
to march up to the sticking point boldly, who
would show their hands; who would yet halt and
occupy neutral ground, and from what quarter
" the non-committals would come " Until a de-
cision was had, the South could not know their
true position. When the question was finally
acted upon and decided, they could then claim to
know that those who were not with them were
against them.
SURPLUS REVENUE
SPEECH OF HON. ASHER ROBBINS,
OF RHODE ISLAND,
In Senate, February 18, 1836,
On the Resolution introduced by Mr Benton,
respecting Fortifications, &c
Mr Benton's resolution for appropriating the
surplus revenue to national defense, was taken
up as the special order.
Mr. ROBBINS rose and addressed the Senate
as follows:
The proposed appropriation of #3,000,000 on
the last night of the last Congress, (now forced
into this debate, on the resolution now proposed
to pledge the surplus levenue to the defenses and
armament of the country, and making so promi-
nent a part in this debate, though it has nothing
to do with the merits of the question presented by
the resolution,)—this $3,000,000 appropriation,
I say, was refused, on theground that it could not
be granted as proposed without a violation of the
Constitution, which we are all sworn to support,
or, in other words, which we are all sworn not to
violate It is true, other objections were urged,
and had their weight, but this was the decisive
objection, at least, it was so with me, and, as I
believe, with that abused majority with whom I
voted I think it the more necessary to make this
statement, as I see the ground of refusal by the
Senate has been strangely misconceived, or still
more stiangely misrepresented, in quarters and
by persons of whom better information or more
candor might have been expected.
I propose, now, simply to review the ground,
and to confine my remarks to the argument that
went to prove conclusively, as I then thought,
and still think, that such an appropi lation would
be a violation of the Constitution:
The proposed appropi lation was in the follow-
ing words.
1 " Jini he it further enacted, That the sum of $3,000,000
be, and the same i^ hereby, appropriated out of any money
in the Trea^urv not other  i-e ippropnated, to be expended,
in whole or in part, under the direcuon of the President
oí the United States, for the military and naval service,
including tortiflcations and ordnance, and increase of the
Navy Provided, Such expenditure shall be rendered neces-
sary for the defense of the country prior to the next meeting
ot Congress "
Who was to judge of the necessity here spoken
of' The Piesident himself Then the money was
to be placed in the hands of the President, to be
used at his discretion How was the money to
be expended' For any naval or military prep-
aration for the defense of the country, and that
also in his discretion Under the implied authority
of this vote, then, the President might raise an
aimy in addition to our present army, for this
would be for military service in defense of the
country, if he chose so to consider it Under the
express authonty of this vote, he might provide
a navy in addition to our present navy, for this,
too, would be for naval service in defense of the
country, ij he chose so to consider it I need not
say, that an authority to do these things implies
an authority to do all other things which would
be necessary and proper as means to these ends
I How any constitutional jurist could conceive
that such an appropriation, with this sweeping
authority, would not be a violation of the Con-
stitution, oi how any such jurist can still contend
for such an interpretation of the Constitution, I
am at a loss to imagine Why, who does not
see' It is to transfer, by a vote of Congress, to
the Executive, all the poweis of war, except
merely those of issuing letters of mark and re-
prisal, and of actually declaring and waging war,
powers vested by the Constitution in Congress,
expressly and exclusively. The Constitution
expressly ordains that the Congress is to raise
armies and to provide navies, and yet this ap-
propi íation would have authorized the Executive
to do both. I need not remind this body, for to
them it is a truism, that all the powers of Con-
gress are trust powers, and incapable of alienation
or substitution by the trustee. Where is the
constitutional jurist, I ask, either here or else-
where, who will seriously contend that Congress
can transfer the constitutional powers expressly
