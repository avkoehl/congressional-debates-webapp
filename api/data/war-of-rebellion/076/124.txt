I feel certain we have killed and crippled for Johnston as many as we have sent to the rear. Have sent back about 6,000 or 7,000 prisoners, taken 11 guns of Johnston, and about 10 in Rome. Have destroyed immense iron, cotton, and wool mills, and have possession of all the niter country. My operations have been rather cautions than bold, but on the whole I trust are satisfactory to you. all of Polk's, corps is till here; also Hardee's and Hood's, and the Georgia militia, under G. W. Smith.

Let us persevere and trust to the fortunes of war, leaving statesmen to work out the solution.

As every, your friend,

W. T. SHERMAN.

HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, near Chattahoochee River, July 12, 1864.

General THOMAS:

Has anything been done with the pontoon bridge of the enemy at Pace's? We should either get full possession of it or destroy it altogether, for when we cross to the other side, leaving a mere guard of cavalry on this, the bridge might be most mischievous to us. Please order that it be got at night, or the planking thrown off and boats scuttled.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
