that the objection applied now, since, if it was
sustained, it would be absurd to go on and vote
upon the question of ordering to a third reading at
this time.
After some further conversation upon incidental
points of order, the question was taken, and the
decision of the Speaker, that it was not in order
to read the bill the third time to-day,-was sustained
by the House: Ayes 100, noes 87.
CIVIL AND DIPLOMATIC APPROPRIATIONS.
On motion of Mr. VINTON, the House re-
solved itself into Committee of the Whole on the
state of the Union, (Mr. Root, of Ohio, in the
chair,) and resumed the consideration of the gen-
eral appropriation bill.
Mr. HILLIARD being entitled to the floor, ad-
dressed the. committee in a speech which occupied
an hour, in explanation of certain amendments he
designed to offer to the bill in relation to our diplo-
matic missions, &c.
[This speech will be found in the Appendix.]
Mr. SAWYER next obtained the floor; but he
gave way, at the request of Mr. Hall, of Mis-
souri, for a motion to rise, and the committee rose
accordingly, and reported progress.
Mr. VINTON, by direction of the Committee
of Ways and Means, submitted a resolution to
terminate debate on the civil and diplomatic ap-
• propriation bill on Monday next, at two o'clock.
Mr. THOMPSON, of Mississippi, objected.
Mr. VINTON. The motion was a privileged one.
Mr. JEN K.1NS moved an adjournment, but with-
drew it at the request of several gentlemen.
Mr. THOMPSON said, to-morruw was Thurs-
day, and the succeeding days of this week were
private bill days; he therefore hoped the resolu-
tion would not be adopted.
Mr. VINTON urged the necessity of adopting
the resolution.
Mr. THOMPSON, of Mississippi, moved an
adjournment. Lost.
Mr. VINTON had no objection to allow the reso-
lution to he over until to-morrow. The object of
the Committee of Ways and Means was 
Mr. HOUSTON, of Alabama, said the resolu-*
tion was not debatable.
Mr. VINTON said he had no intention to de-
bate it. ft is object was simply to say that he had
offered the resolution in obedience to the direction
of the Committee of Ways and Means, but he was
willing that it should lie over, as it would show
what their intention was. It was necessary that
the bill should be passed at an early period, that
it might go to the Sennte, where, gentlemen must
not forget, it had to he considered before it could
become a law. He suggested that the House
should now take up the navy appropriation bill,
which would also have to be returned to the Senate.
It would be recollected that that bill was ordered
to be engrossed for a third reading, but some ob-
jection was made to its passage. Subsequently he
had communicated with the Secretary of the Navy,
who had made in it some reductions which he
hoped would now be concurred in without recom-
mittal.
NAVAfc APPROPRIATION BILL.
By general consent the naval appropriation bill
was then taken from the Speaker's table, and the
question was stated to be on its third reading.
Mr. VINTON begged leave to make a brief ex-
planation. At the time this bill was reported, in
answer to a question put to him, the Secretary of
the Navy informed the Committee of Ways and
Means that the unexpended balance for this branch
of the service at the close of the year would be
about $1,000,000, and the first section of the bill
appropriated for the service for the next fiscal year
the unexpended balance in hand at the end of the
year. The estimates of the Secretary must neces-
sarily be conjectural to some extent. The answer
of which he had spoken was given in January last,
when it was scarcely possible that the Secretary
should know what the balance in hand would be.
We were now near the end of the year, and the
Secretary was now of opinion that the balance in
hand would amount to $2,500,000, instead of
$1,000,000, as estimated three or four months ago.
He had then an amendment to offer to limit the
amount of appropriations of unexpended balances
of fourer appropriations to $1,500,000, and to
provide that the residue should be returned to the ,
surplus fund. It was, in- effect, to cut down the j
appropriated unexpended balances #1,000,000. He I
begged further to state that a naval peace estab-
lishment was confined to 7,500 men and boys; but
since the Mexican war was begun, the Secretary
of the Navy was authorized to employ a greater
number, not exceeding 10.000; that employment,
however, was limited to the time of the war; at the
close of which, the naval establishment would fall
back, as a matter of course, to 7,500. The esti-
mates had been predicated on a state of war, and
as peace was now made, the Secretary of the Navy
had reduced his estimates, and the item of the bill
in this respect must n©w be reduced some 25 per
'cent. There were other amendments which he
would request the Clerk to read.
The Clerk read all the amendments accordingly.
They were as follows :
In the first item, strike out the words "to the
4 unexpended balances of former' appropriations
1 for the naval service," and insert u the sum of
' $1,500,000 of the unexpended balances of former
' appropriations for the naval service, the remain-
* derof such unexpended balances, after deducting
* the said sum of $1,5U0,000, to be carried to the
* surplus fund."
In the second item, reduce the amount from
" 02,918,948" to « $2,189,211."
In the item "for provisions for commission,
warrant, and petty officers and seamen, including
engineers and marines attached to vessels for sea
service," reduce the amount from "$903,813" to
$677,860/'
In the item "for surgeons'necessaries and ap-
pliances for the sick and hurt of the navy, inclu-
ding: the maiine corps," reduce the amount from
" $38,000" to " $28,500."
In the item "for increase, repair, armament,
and equipment for the navy, including wear and
tear of vessels in commission, coal for steamers, !
purchase of hemp, and one million two hundred i
thousand dollars for completing four first class !
steamers,'' reduce the amount from "$2,975,281" 1
to " $2,531,474."
Strikeout of the 2d section the words "funds from ;
one head of appropriation to another head of the I
appropriations made for the naval service: this au-
thority of transfer to remain so long- as the war
with Mexico shall continue, and no Jone*er;" and J
insert " any portion of the sum of $1,500,000 of
the unexpended balances of former appropriations ;
mentioned in the 1st section of this act from one I
head of appropriation to any other head of the ap-
propriations made for the naval service." And
add the following as a new section:
Sec. —.  dndbe it further enacted, That it shall he the duty
of the Postmaster General, under the direction of the Presi-
dent, to cause tl|e net leeeipts of po>t.iges collected on the
several lines of strainers from New York to Livei pool, from
New York to Charges, and from Panama to some point in
the Territory of Oreiron, stipulated for in contracts made
with the Secretary o( the, Navy, to he deposited in the treas-
ury to the credit of the appropriation for the annual com-
pensation for the scrviee lo be  endered under said contracts,
or othenvise applv the said postages m payment of the said
annual compensation.
Mr. McKAYsaid, that as he had objected to the
third readingof the bill when it was, on a former day,
before the House, he asked the indulgence of gen-
tlemen now, in making a brief explanation. This
bill, as it was reported by the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the "Union, and subsequent-
ly ordered to be engrossed, contained appropria-
tions to the amount of $J 1,277,133. The Secretary
admitted that there would be at the close of the pres-
ent fiscal year, of the unexpended balances of former
appropriations, about $2,500,000. He (Mr. McK.)
was satisfied, from a statement which had been fur-
nished to him by some of the treasury officers, that
the amount of these balances would be larger,
say $3,000,000 If this latter estimate should be
realized, the House would at once perceive that
there would be an aggregate sum appropriated for
and applicable to the naval service, for the next fis-
cal year, of $14,277,133.
He supposed that it would be conceded, on both
sides of the House, that this was entirely too large.
The bill as it was originally reported to the House,
had been framed by the committee on the suppo-
sition that the war with Mexico might continue
duringthe nextyear. Wehad now positive assuran-
ces that the relations of peace will soon be reestab-
lished between the two countries. It seemed to him
that in this change of the condition of the country,
it was every way proper that the appropriations
should be reduced, adapting them toa peace estab-
lishment. The reductions which had been suggested
by the Secretary of the Navy, and which were now
before the House, on the recommendation of the
Committee of Ways and Means, would, if adopted
by the House, still leave the appropriations /or the
naval service upwards of eleven millions of dollars.
This, it would be recollected, was for a state of
peace,and was a largeramount than had been made
for the same object in any year prior to the com-
mencement of the war with Mexico. He would,
for the information of the House, state the appro-
priations and expenditures for the naval establish-
ment for several years past, which were as follows:
•/impropriations. Expenditures.
1835 $4.99*,23*13 $3,864,939 05
1838   5,076 336 88..-.,. *6,131.W053

1848—'7   7.771,773 64   7.900 635 76
He admitted that there was force in the sugges-
tion, that in consequence of the unsettled state of
Europe, it might be prudent to employ a larger
naval force than would otherwise be required,and
thus increase the expenditure. Should the House,
theiefore, agree to the reductions which had been
proposed, he would withdraw any further opposi-
tion to the passage of the bill, though, as there were
provisions in it which were in his opinion exceed-
ingly exceptionable, he could not give it his vote.
The amendments were then agreed to collective-
ly, and the question recurred on the third reading-
of the bill.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee, said he was unwill-
ing to vote for this bill; nnd would not, though his
vote should reject it, and Withhold from the navy
every dollar of appropriation for the next fiscal
year. Aside from the enormous and unnecessary
appropriations whicty are proposed to be made by
the provisions of the bill for the support of the navy
for the next year, it contains appropriations for
purposes wild, visionary, and unauthorized by the
Constitution, which he never had and never would
sanction or approve by his vote. That so far as
he was concerned, those who had voted this bill
into its present shape must take the responsibility
of passing it.. Therefore be called for the yeas and *
nays on the passage of the bill.
The yeas and nays were ordered, and being
taken, resulted thus: Yeas 105, nays 41. So the
bill was ordered to be read a third time; and, having
been so read, was passed.
Mr. VINTON moved to reconsider the vote on
the passage of the bill; and the motion to recon-
sider was laid on the table.
ADULTERATED DRUGS.
On motion of Mr. EDWARDS, the House pro-
ceeded to consider the amendments of the Senate
to the bill of the House to prevent the importation
of adulterated drugs and medicines.
The amendments of the Senate were read and
agreed to, and the bill is therefore passed.
And then the House adjourned.
IN SENATE.1
