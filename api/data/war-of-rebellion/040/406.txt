HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,May 4, 1863 - 8.55 a. m.

Major-General HOOKER:

I am occupying same position as last night. I have secured my communication with Banks' Ford. The enemy are in possession of the heights of Fredericksburg in force. They appear strongly in our front, and are making efforts to drive us back. My strength yesterday morning was 22,000 men. I do not know my losses, but they were large, probably 5,000 men. I cannot use the cavalry. It depends upon the condition and position of your force whether I can sustain myself here. Howe reports the enemy advancing upon Fredericksburg.

Major-General.

General BUTTERFIELD,

Old Headquarters Camp:

Colonel McMahon has just left here, and has reported favorably as to General Sedgwick. I have just received orders to lay a second bridge down, however. I now forward your communications to him, and will keep you advised. It is just reported to me that Newton is falling back on my bridge. Your two copies for General Sedgwick now go together.
