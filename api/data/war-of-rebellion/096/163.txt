Three cheers for the fall of Fort Fisher. I will send the news at once to our picket-line. Allow me to suggest that the dispatch he printed on general-order paper and distributed along the picket-line. In that way the rank and file of the enemy will be informed of the facts.

HEADQUARTERS,January 17, 1865 - 3 p. m.

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

Commanding U. S. Army:

In to-day's Sentinel's report of proceedings of rebel House of Representatives yesterday is a warm debate upon an article of the Sentinel, stigmatizing as treason the proposition before the House in secret session to open negotiations for peace. A motion to allow resolutions to come up which pronounced the Sentinel article flase was lost; vote, 32 ayes, 36 noes. Smith, of Alabama, regarded this vote as indorsing the Sentinel's article, and left to go home. Afterward they took a vote on a resolution tat no privilege had been violated in arresting Foote, one of their members, and that he be left to the care of the military; lost; vote, 36 noes, 35 ayes. I think these proceedings important enough to telegraph to the President. Barksdale quelled the storm by stating by authority that the Sentinel was not Mr. Davis's organ.

E. O. CV. ORD,

Major-General.
