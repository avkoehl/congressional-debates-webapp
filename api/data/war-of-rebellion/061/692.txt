upon the pioneer corps of my division have been incessant. They have worked night and day, and I know not of any body of men connected with the army entitled to greater credit than they.

I have the honor to inclose herewith tabular statements of the effective strength with which I left Little Rock, and the losses sustained by regiments in the different skirmishes and actions. From these it will be seen that my division left Little Rock numbering 5,226 officers and men, and that its aggregate loss in killed, wounded, and missing has been 1,775.

I have the honor to remain, your most obedient servant,

F. SALOMON,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Major W. D. GREEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Department of Arkansas.
