GRAHAMVILLE, January 6, 1865.

Major-General McLAWS:

No signs of the enemy advancing. My pickets were ordered to advance at daylight and dispute their march, but have not reported. Have sent others out. Think it probable a reconnaissance in force, and they have probably stopped to-day to rebuild the river bridge. General Humes has arrived with his division.

Lieutenant CHAPMAN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Wheeler's Corps:

The enemy in considerable force crossed New River bridge last evening about 4 o'clock, and at dark were at the head of Fording Island road, within sixteen miles of this, and drove my pickets back. I was just ordered by General McLaws to re-enforce the picket there with artillery, but it is too late. My pickets report having seen but little cavalry, and that they moved on rapidly after crossing. The courier says they had not stopped when he left at dark; and they may move right on here, or may go up the Savannah and Charleston road to Coosawhatchie. I will meet them with 100 men, all I can spare, at Glover's, four miles from here on the road to the bridge. Please notify General Humes.

Very respectfully,

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY DIVISION,Grahamville, January 6, 1865--10 a. m.

Lieutenant M. G. HUDSON,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have nothing further to report from the enemy this morning. I have sent Colonel McLemore, with about 100 men and one piece of artillery, to Glover's, on the road from Grahamville to New River bridge, where there is some fortifications this side of a rice plantation. Colonel McLemore thinks it can be flanked, with so small a force to defend it. General McLaws requested last night that I should ask General Wheeler for artillery, stating that what was here had been ordered across the Salkehatchie. As it was so far to yours, I did not ask for it. No order has been received for this yet, and I am getting ready to use it. I have everything saddled up and ready to move as circumstances may occasion, and will send my wagons to Gillisonville when we do move. The enemy made no stop at New River bridge; scouts say they did not see more than fifty cavalry.

Very respectfully,

G. G. DIBRELL,

Colonel, Commanding.
