expenses, and for his own and his brother's service charge 2 1\2 per cent. commission. He could take samples of the articles with him, but, except the shoes, his brother is as good a judge of what you want as can be found; but I would suggest to get blue cloth instead of gray, for it is warmer; at any rate for half the order. I beg leave to suggest reasons why I think Great Britain and France will remove the blockade: First, each derives $20,000,000 to $25,000,000 of revenue from tobacco. Second. Great Britain has 3,500,000 population directly dependent on cotton and 2,500,000 more directly connected with it. Third. She has $200,000,000 capital invested in factories of cotton, which would be idle, involving 1,200 mills, besides coal mines. Fourth. That the failure to export largely of cotton goods to India and China would cause a ruinous drain of silver and gold to those regions to procure many necessaries now obtained from them. Fifth. It would injuriously affect trade, commerce, shipping, and banking in all Europe. Sixth. France and Germany are equally dependent on Great Britain for like causes, and especially as the Continent gets much of its yarn from England-the export last year 1,142,000,000 yards of cotton goods and 28,000,000 pounds of yarn to China and India, all of which prevented, so far, the export of coin. England and France have no coin now to spare--not enough to buy our cotton. Seventh. The stock of American cotton in Liverpool on the 19th of July was and export was at the rate of 45,000 bales per week, which would consume every bale of it by the 15th of December next; that to get supplies they must begin to load ships hereby October, and it must go forward at the rate of 50,000 to 60,000 bales per week to keep them at work, and much faster than that to put them into stock, even at 10d. per pound. The price of cotton is now 18 cents in New York, and the necessities of Northern factories have caused imports from Liverpool, where the price was only 16 cents by last advices.

The only apprehension Great Britain need fell is to get France to act with her. In that event Lincoln may make war on her, turn his privateers loose and cut up her commerce, which would greatly benefit his bankrupt people and give France the per-eminence in commerce. Mr. Battersby waits your instructions to go to Richmond, either by telegram or letter, and I will go, too, if necessary.

Yours,

G. B. LAMAR.

Hon. L. P. WALKER,

Secretary of War, Richmond:

SIR: Since I sent my letter to you of this date it occurs to me that Mr. Charles Green, of this city--a British subject, too, and equally responsible to attend to any business intrusted to him for the Confederate States. Letters of instruction and bills of exchange can be sent to him via Tennessee and Louisville, and I have his cipher, with which I can correspond with him secretly, and I can send pilots from here to him, and they would only know they were going to England to meet him. Sterling exchange can be had here to the extent of $500,000 and $600,000 at 10 and 15 per cent. ; in Charleston, about 12 1\2
