If Your Excellency's thinks best to subdivide the quotas herein assigned to Congressional districts and allot proportional parts to smaller subdivisions of your State, I would suggest that for harmonizing the subject of credits in drafts hereafter you regard the enrollment of the first class made by this Bureau as the basis of assignment.

The provost-marshal-general of your State and the boards of enrollment in the different districts will give you all the aid in their power in this and all other matters connected with raising troops.

WAR DEPT., PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL" OFFICE,

Washington, D. C., October 18, 1863.

His Excellency J. A. GILMORE,

Governor of New Hampshire, Concord, N. H.:

SIR: I have the honor to inform you that New Hampshire's quota of the 300,000 volunteers called for by the President's proclamation of the 17th instant is as follows: First District, 1,390; Second District, 1,129; Third District, 1,249; total, 3,768. This quota is the proportion of 300,000 men which New Hampshire should furnish, according to the number of men of the first class enrolled in that State, and without any regard to the quota assigned her for the present draft, or the number of men obtained under that draft, and without regard to any deficiency she may have had under the calls for volunteers previous to the assignment of quotas for the present draft.

The quota of New Hampshire for the present draft was as follows: First District, 1,968; Second District, 1,599; Third District, 1,769; total, 5,336.

Up to the 17th instant the number obtained on these quotas was as follows: First District, 831; Second District, 512; Third District, 434; total obtained, 1,777, leaving on present draft as made up to the 17th instant a deficiency of 3,559. On all calls previous to the present draft the deficiency of New Hampshire was 388, total deficiency, 3,947.

The total quota, therefore, of New Hampshire for the next draft, in case another is rendered necessary by a failure to raise volunteers, as it appears from records up to the 17th instant, would be 3,768, the quota of 300,000 herein assigned, and the deficiencies up to the date specified, that is, 3,947; total quota, 7,715. But this total deficiency (3,947) will of course be reduced by all held to service under the present draft after the 17th instant, and by all volunteers not heretofore credited, as well as by all the State may raise in excess of 3,768, her quota of 300,000 as called for by the President's proclamation.

If Your Excellency thinks best to subdivide the quotas herein assigned to Congressional districts, and allot proportional parts to smaller subdivisions of your State, I would suggest that for harmonizing the subject of credits in drafts hereafter you regard the enrollment of the first class made by this Bureau as the basis of assignment. The provost-marshal-general of your State and the boards of enrollment in the different districts will give you all the aid in their power in this and all other matters connected with raising troops.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAS. B. FRY,

Provost-Marshal-General.
