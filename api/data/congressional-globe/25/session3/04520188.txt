Interference in Elections—Mr. Roafte.
Senate.
Jefferson, Madison, Taylor, and hundreds of
othets, whose paths we can safely follow
Sir, those who are perpetually quaffing from
the pure fountains, as they call them, of Locke
and other British writers, but too frequently, be-
fore their thirst is slaked are found drinking from
the muddy pool of Filmer, yes, sir, the exploded
doctrines of Filmer, that man is not capable of
self-government lies at the bottom, and is the
necessai y inference ftom all these fine theories
diawn fiom British writings and British prac-
tices My colleague should recollect, m all his
learned, and, in my opinion, mistaken applica-
tions from England to this country, this great
essential difference between the two Governments,
which constitutes our great shield There they
have septennial elections and a hereditary mon-
arch , here we have frequent election! and twenty-
six separate, independent governments, all watch-
ing with ceaseless vigilance the movements of each
other, and of the General Government, common
to them all; and, sir, if my colleague could look
with the samé Democratic eye of faith and admi
ration for the precepts of the immoital Jefferson
he has so often professed, he would admit that
thete is nothing in the chaiactei 01 history of his
life, or in any word m his wntmgs, that does not
put upon the whole British system the seal of his
abhorrence and detestation Yet, sn, is that sys
tern quoted in this Senate as a modi 1 foi muta-
tion, and as an argument m fivoi of the present
extraordinary and abominable, bill' I could cite
innutneiabie passages fiom the writings of Jeflu
son to sustain me, if time permitted, but lam ad-
monished to diaw to a close on this subjt ct, and
pass on to othcis I am, sir, a Demociat of the
school of 1798 I have never changed my name or
my pnnciplcs My colleague well recollects Mr
Jefferson's prophetic history of the change of
names which the old Hamiltonmn Federalists
Would assume, but I doubt whether hw prophetic
8i.itit could keep pace with the extended nomen-
clature of the present day
Mr President, one word more about this jeal-
ousy of Executive power. I have shown that it
is against Federal power, m all its departments,
that the States ought to bo jealous What has
been the history of the Government as to this
point' Everytwo years shows you creat changes
in the populai binnch of youi Govt rnmeilt, and
they are vc ry often occuning hete by the power
of a vigilant people. "Vet, sn, in npenod of fifty
years, there have bo< n only two instantes in
which the Picsident of the Unittd States has not
given satisfaction to his i onstitut nts, only twit e,
in the thirteen elections we have had of a Picsi
dent, hive the ptople oxpiessed tin ir disippio
bation of his conduct Your Congrtss has passi d
uncons itutiomil laws, one 01 moie judges hn\o
been impeached, buttheie has not bet nan instance
yet in wluth tlic President of the United Stnt< s
has been impeached No, sir, with all thebittei
opposition which each of them has eneounteicd,
not out has yet been impeached ' Then, why all
this i ailing against the danger of Executive usuip
ation > Who does not see that it is unfounded,
and all foi paity aggiandi7,ementi Sir, when,
some ft w years ago, an honorable Senator fiom
Kentucky, now in my eye, [Mr f'l \y,] oflered
to the Senate a resolution condemi nig and cen
suntig, in strong teims, the official conduct of the
then President of the United States, it was deemed
to boa sou of quasi impeachment of that high of-
ficer, and my colleague promptly stepped foi waid,
mid, by an able speech and an efficient vote, aided
to expanse the resolution fiom youi Journals, on
which it had been recorded, and yet, sn , he is
niHB alarmed at the mighty "perstwmte" powers
of these poor gangers, weighers, and tide-waiters'
He is frightened about Fxeeutive pationage '
Sir, I must pass on My colleague, on this sub
ject, as on many others, admonishes us against
the " mad dominion" of party spmt Yes, sir,
vt ry much has he said about motives, about pai ty
and party laches and party dictation, and about pa
tuotism and elevated, statesmanlike views, and
all th it Not less strange than new is it to hear
linn thus railing against party '
I have nothing, sir, to do with the patriotism
oi motives of any gentleman I only claim for
myself all that any Senatoi can ask and receive
on that score, while I set up no special claim to
those great statesmanlike views, rising above all
party feeling, of which we are so often reminded
by my colleague, and whilst I boast not of a patri-
otism warmer, or motives purer, than those of
others, yet, sir, am bold to say, that I am-utterly
unconscious of ever having been actuated by any
vote given in this Chamber by any other consid-
eration than a free, independent, and unbiased
desire to promote the public good I came into
this Chamber, and am at this moment, as fiee as
any man in it to pursue on all questions which
may arise whatever course my own conscience
and judgment shall indicate as most conducive to
the best interests of the nation I had no con-
sistencies to establish, no inconsistencies to rec-
oncile, no íesentments'to giatify,no heait-burn-
mgs to ap'pcase, no favors to ask, no hopes to
indulge, no fears to allay, and, thank God, no
ambition to gratify I brought with me no bant-
ling scheme of my own, and have most patiently
and attentively listened to all that have been pro-
posed by others, to give ease to the public mind,
and piomote the great interests of our btloved
countiy And if", sir, like the fabled Momus,
there was a glass in my bosom, I would not hes-
itate to jieimitall the woild to look in upon the
opeintions of my heart, in regard to the great na-
tion tl questions we have agitated in this Chamber
Put, Mi Picsident, cantloi requites thatl should
admit that, on such an inspection, it would not be
found that those opeiations were beyond the nach
oi influenct ofputy 1 admit, sir, that they aie
mut h contiolletl by party feelings. I pietend
not to be beyond oi above the influence of party
I am a paity man, and glory in being so, for my
heait tells me that my paity feelings are the result
of in honest and an anient, though, perhaps,
mistaken oi misguided, patuotism I doubt not
the word of any gentleman who «ays he is not
influenced by paity feelings But, sir, it is al-
most inconceivable, to me, how any man, who
has taken an active pait m the late political tur-
moils of the day, can be free from its mfiuenct>
Whoevei he may be, Ins tcmpeianient is very dif
ferent fiom mint, and, I belitve, fiom that of
nine tenths of the pi opli nt this tountiy, and of
Liijdand too, and I go fm thei, antl say that neithei
of tht st t mutuos would long prest i ve tlitn lib
eity but ftii paity spiut, antl that tlu gnat pun
ciple of stlf pit solvation will always aflnd a
turn ly diet 1c to its mail or dangiious excesses
Of this iiiitli we lime íecontly had an ex mphfi
cition at 1J irusbuig, m Pt nnsylvania, which is
tonsolatoiy tnevt ly lovei of tin hbei ty and union
ofAmtuoa Mi Presidí nt, in conn etion with
this subjt 11 of paity spun, which my colli ague
now so bittoily rt pi oh m s, and in oidoi fully 10
define my position in i gaid to some of the lead
mgtopns of the day, I Ik g U ivc tobe pcimittod
to takt a butf antl lapitl rt view of the present
Adnnmstiation of the Pt doral Government, and
its suppoitets and opponents
riiioughout Amenta we have recently passi d
thiough a convulsive s niggli to foim a new cx-
trutivc admmistintion Violent, indeed, was that
stiugglt 1 hat paity who, foi eight lonj; ytais,
had so bitttily oppost tl all, ay, "n , nidisci im-
lnitt ly all the loading moasuies of the lito Ad
minisuation, made a bold, grand, and well con
cot tod etfirt to elect a Chit í Magisti ate entertaining
thin own fielmgs and opinions Their oppo-
nents were equally active and untiring in their
exoitions to elect one who would, m the main,
puisne the eoui¡>e of that leviled Administration,
ay, su, if you choose so to have it, who would
" JoUow in the footsteps of his illusti touspr edicessor "
1 hey succeeded in those exettions, and elected
the piesent Chief Magistrate I,sn,m Vnginia,
in my individual capacity, took a zealous and open
pirt, within my limited spheie of action in aid-
ing to bring Mirtin Van Bi ion, of Now Yoilc, to
the station he now so ablv fills, and was one of
the organs of Virginia, in he i electoral college,
to bestow upon him the vote of that ancient Dem-
ociatic Commonwealth In that memorable con-
test, we encounttied all that excited, nay, mad-
dened, pal tyspii it could addlebs to the ijjuoiance,
to the feais, the ptejudices, or interest!, of a vn
tnous people The vocabulary of epithet was
exhausted and heaped upon us Thejoulest names
ever given to u patty wore fteely bestowed upon
us by oui  adversanes, and the /tit) est that ever
adorned the friends of liberty were assumed for
themselves; but all, all, sir, would not do The
people could not be intimidated or dtluded, they
could not be ^persuaded or dissuaded," they
could not be led or driven to abandon those evi-
dent principles of republicanism they had so long
and so dearly cherished     In vain, sir, had they
I been told that Andiew Jackson was a despnt, a
kriaie, and a fool m vain had they been told, m
one bieath.that he was ase//willed, obstinate,tn-
! dovutable tyiant, and in the next, that he was a
cypher, a supple tool, a mei o automaton, vilt ly nspd
by otheis, and in vain, also, were they told by
these same men that the promises of Mai tin Van
Buren could not be relied on, that he was filse-
hood and treachciy peisomfied that, notwith-
standing his oft-declared opposition to a national
bank, he would, in his first message to Congress,
recommend one in its most odious form, to be lo-
cated in his favorite city of New York, and that,
maugerall his honeyed woids and fan piomises
about southern lights, and the satjred comp%omvtes
of the Constitution, he would, befoie he was warm
in the presidential chan, show himself to be in
heart and deed, a northern Abolitionist, and much
more such piophetic stuff, which I will not waste
your piecious time to recapitulate, lias he ver-
ified the forebodings of these men in any one of
these paitioulars? I ask his filends, and I ask
his foes, and for their complete and entire falsi-
fication, I appeal to the three calm, luminous,
statesmanlike, republican messages he has already
sent to the Congress of the United States, and I
furtheimore appeal to his whole oonduct, both
public and private, since he has filled the presi-
dential chair
I have, it is true, heard much difference of
opinion about the correctness and practicability
of his views m regaid to the finance and currency
of the counti v, but I have heard no man yet doubt
their constitutionality, or complain of the temper
or manner in which they have been submitted to
the consitleiation of Congress And here permit
me, sn, foi myself, to say, that I have heard no
man yet (and I have listened attentively to all
that has been said here, and read much that has
bien wnttcn) who Ins answeied the lucid aigu-
ments by which he has sustained them, oi shaken
the fnm, republican, constitutional ground on
which his recommendation of an independent
Pieasuiy, in which to keep the peoph 's. money
st cine from the clutches of bank or other specu-
lator, is based Mr Pi esident, believing Mai tin
Van Buien to be a republican, and a statesman
o'f the fust ordei, I cime into Congress with a
picdisposition, nay, sir, I might almost say with
a pltdgt, and pi (.determination, to suppoit his
adiyunistiaiion, not n%ht or tojonir, sn, no,sn,
not to "register his edicts," no, sir, foi I abhor
and lnath all dependence and vassalage as much, or
\ more, than those who now boast most loudly of
] thou independence and patriotism and dismteiest-
edness     I camo heie elected by those who con-
j tttbuled to elect him, and I came, sn, I lepeat,
dott nnmed to support his administiation as far
as I possibly could, with a sate conscience, and
not to abandon it foi light and tnvial causes,
and, above all things, foi any cause peisonal to
myself    This couitt, Í  undeitake to say, was
^ cvuieud fiom me by every man of even party
I in Vnginn I have thus far given to it an honest
suppoit, and, in so doing, my conscience and my
judgment sustain my course Not, sir, has it
been neeessaiy to my supoortof his admirustia-
I Hon, that 1 should concur in all his vu ws and
recommendations, any moie lhan that I should
1 have deemed it ¡iroper to become its bitter op
poseí, because I differed with hun on any one
measuie of policy     That, sn, I have done, and
, am at all times fiee to do It cannot be expected
that theie can, in the nature of the human mind,
be a universal concuirence of opinion on every
subject, e\en among those wl o generally agiee
'Ihe whole countiy k ious my couise, fiom the
hist moment 1 took my seat in the Senate to the
piesent time, in regtrd to the gieat sub|ect of the
public lands, on wluth 1 have differed entuely
tiom mat y of my political friends, and, su, had
1 been associated with my colleague dunng the
edmimstiation of General Jackson, when he lec-
ommendod the same policy in regard to them
which is advocated by his successor, 1 should
