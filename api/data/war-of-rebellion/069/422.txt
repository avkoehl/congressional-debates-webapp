MAY 31, 1864-12.25 p. m.

Colonel AMES:

I send re-enforcements; perhaps you can drive them out of the brush. As soon as possible cut that skirt of woods between you and our left, so that we can cover your flanks.

B. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

SPRING HILL SIGNAL STATION, May 31, 1864.

General BUTLER:

I think there is no need of re-enforcements. The enemy occupy the rive bank to the right of here, a little above the point visited yesterday. They seem to be creeping up a little, as if to post their sharpshooters in the brush.

AMES,

Colonel.

General HINKS:

Is Special Orders, Numbers 35, to be carried out at once, or wait till the enemy leaves our front? It orders the 20-pounders to City Point. Is there an attack at City Point?

AMES,

Colonel.

MAY 31, 1864-1.30 p. m.

General.
