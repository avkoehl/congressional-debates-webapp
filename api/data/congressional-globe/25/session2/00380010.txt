larger, and weie about one hundred millions be-
yond the rate of imports during the last quarter.
The exports auunp- fhatqnartei were $19,159,-
034, bpmg $13,105,510 of domestic origin, aai
$6,052,524 of ioreign growth. By this result, it
w ill be gratif} mg lo see that the impoiLs, though
diminished, were not all needed for home con-
sumption, and that a greater propoition of them
than m the for«aer quarters has been sent abroad m
reduce the foreign debt. Yet the whole exports
were smaller than many anticipated. They have
also \er> unexpectedly been $3,533,313 less in
amount than the imports during the sane quarter
But ii freights, commissions and profits, as well as
remittancebin stoeKsof /rnouslands,aretakenmto
computation, the probabdit ei are, that the foreign
debt, so far fiom having been increased within that
period, has been lessened some millions, but not to
so great an extent as most persons have supposed.
In the laM report on the finances, some suggestions
were made, v. Inch further expeuence has served
to veufy, respecting the influence which the sudden
fall in the price of cotton had exerted during the
veai in producing commercial embarrassments, as
w ell as a diminution m 'ht x alue of our exports.
It may be useful to adv ert a moment to the un-
usual effect upon both of those subjects, caused by
the fluctuations in another article

rati y years, the value of the gram and flour ím-
po.ted did not exceed a few thousand dolleis, while
that exported w as, or, an average, quite $6 000,000
Sometimes it exceeded ex en <.!',000,000, and so
late as J833, '34, and '35, amounted to nearly
$5,000,000 annually. But m the year ending Sep-
tember 30th, 1837, the exports of them fe 1 off
nearly a million, while the imports xvere augment-
ed in value to the unprecedented amount of more
than four and a half millions
