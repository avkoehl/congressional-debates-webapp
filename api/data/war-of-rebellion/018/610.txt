HDQRS. FIRST AND SECOND DIVS., NINTH ARMY CORPS,August 21, 1862.

Major-General POPE,

Commanding Army of Virginia:

GENERAL: I have just received a letter from General Burnside, stating that he would send troops to Barnett's Ford to-morrow. Would it not be well for you to request him to hurry them up?

General Buford has just returned. Longstreet's and Hill's divisions were the troops he was engaged with. They appear to be returning toward Rappahannock Station. The general reports them in strong force. He had a very successful skirmish, compelling their whole force to retire to the cover of the woods. Some 8 or 10 of his men were killed and wounded.
