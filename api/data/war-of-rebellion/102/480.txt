By order of Major-General Warren:

FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., May 17, 1865. (Received 1 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

The order requiring muster out of cavalry whose terms expire by October 1 will deprive me of a considerable part of the cavalry force now on the plains and break up Indian expedition now on foot. As this would lead to unfortunate consequences, I respectfully ask that the execution of this order be suspended in this military division until summer campaign is over or until it can be executed without danger or embarrassment.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSOURI,May 17, 1865-2. 10 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

General-in-Chief:

General Thomas has sent a brigade of cavalry here without horses or arms. I can furnish them arms from the arsenal, but have no horses, as purchase has been stopped by orders from Washington. We need 2,500 horses to mount them and other cavalry in Department of the Missouri.

JOHN POPE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 17, 1865-3 p. m.

Major-General POPE:

I have decided to sustain your action in regard to the colonization of Missionary Indians at Redwood. Papers indicate that hostilities are again about breaking out in Minnesota. If such is the case you and better re-enforce that country at once. If you have not the troops to do it with, they can be furnished from General Thomas' command. It may be the Indians require as much protection from the whites as the whites do from the Indians. My own experience has been that but little trouble would have ever been had from them but for the encroachment and influence of bad whites.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
