Brigadier-General PRESTON,

Commanding Reserve Corps, Army of the Mississippi:

GENERAL: From information received and considered reliable, the general commanding deems it imprudent for you to advance beyond the Tallahatchie River, as the enemy is in considerable force with large re-enforcements at Grand Junction and Memphis. You will therefore extend your line to and hold that river.

The general further directs that you will hold your command in readiness to execute any orders received from Major-General Van Dorn, who has succeeded Major-General Lovell in command. It is reported that the enemy will soon make a demonstration in force either against Vicksburg or Canton, and all available troops will be needed.

Respectfully, general, your obedient servant,

GEO. G. GARNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
