EXECUTIVE DEPARTMENT,

January 12, 1861.

Honorable WILLIAM M. BROOKS, President State Convention:

SIR: The following resolution, passed by the convention, has just been handed me by the secretary of that body:

Resolved, That the Governor be requested to communicate to the convention any information he may have as to the condition of military operation s near Pensacola.

I regret that it becomes my duty to inform the conventiuon that the Federal troops have deserted the navy - yard and Fort Barrancas, and now occupy Fort pinckens with about eighty men. The guns are spiked at Barrancas and the navy - yard and the public stores removed to Fort Pickets. This fort commands Fort Barrancas and the navy - yard, and can only be taken by an effective force, and by bold and skillful movements. Fort Pickets was garrisoned on Wednesday night. Colonel Lomax left Montgomery on Wednesday night at 7 o' clock, with 225 men, and arrived at Pensacola last night at 10. The 300 troops ordered from Mobile to the same point, under the resolution of the convention, were telegraphed, when about to sail for Pensacola, by Major Chase, in command at Pensacola, to remain in Mobile until the receipt of further orders. The Governor of Mississippi has ordered troops, at my suggestion, to Pensacola. They will halt at mobile, I presume, until ordered to sail for Pensacola. This is all the information I can give at this time. I expect a messenger tonigth with full information.

Colonel D. C. GREEN,

Assistant Quartemaster - General, Mobile, Ala.:

DEAR SIR: I dispatched you yesterday autorizing the draft of

$ 10, 000 on this department for the defense of the forts in Mobile Bay, &amp;c., on my own responsibility, there being no funds appropriated for that purpose. Today I have your dispatch informing me that a meeting of the citizens would be held, and $ 100, 000 would be raised for the defense of the place. I dispatched L. W. Lawler today, requesting that all moneys raised for the purpose indicated, if it was expected they should be reimbursed by the State, must be deposited in bank, to be drawn for by the proper officer upon satisfactory vouchers. Mobile must be defended at whatever cost, but I must earnestly applea to every one connected with the military service of the State to observe as much economy in the uses of the public funds as is consistent with the efficiency of the service. In the present instance let the contemplated work for which these heavy expenditures are to be made be well considered before they are undertaken, and when completed, or as they progress by contract, let them be examined to see if they are in compliance with the engagements, and in all cases let proper vouchers be furnished upon the disbursement of the public money. Heavy drafts will soon have to be nade upon the treasury for military purposes, and it is incumbent upon every patriotic citizen in the employment of the State, so far as it may be in his power, to husband every dollar of her resources by seing that not a dollar is improperly expended. I feel sure that you will appreciate this appeal; that you will respond to it and cause it to be heeded by all under your orders and directions.

Respectfully, &c.,

A. B. MOORE.
