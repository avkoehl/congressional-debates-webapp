The VICE PRESIDENT. The Secretary

by the Committee on Appropriations will be
considered as they are reached in the text of
the bill.
The Chief Clerk proceeded to read the
bill.
The first amendment of the Committee on
Appropriations was on page 4, after line

Eor laying pipe for supply of pure water to Gov-

armory " from $150,000 to $200,000.
The amendment was agreed to.
The VICE PRESIDENT. This completes
the amendments of the Committee on Appro-
^Mr^HARLAN. I offer the foilowingamend-
ment as additional sections to the bill.
That the Secretary of War be. and he is hereby,
authorized and directed to negotiate with a respons-
ible party to build and operatea. telegraph lint from
Yankton, Dakota Territory, to Fort Randall, Da-
kota and thence to Fort Sully, if. in the opinion of
the. Secretary of War, the public service demands
constructing the* "same"the'i"um~of SS.tko; and upon
the completion of the whole line lie shall pay, as
aforesaid, the &um of eighty dollars per mile for any
number of miles the same may extend over the num-
ber of even hundreds: Provided; That the money
so paid shall be refunded to the United States in the
use of said telegraph line, at rates not higher than
charged private individuals, nor higher than may.
in the opinion of said Secretary, be just: Provided
aUos That when the money advanced by the said
Secretary of War shsilj be refunded as above pro-
vided, the United States shall have no title to, nor
lien upon, said line, but may at all times use the
same for public purposes at such rates as may be
just.
Sec. â€”. That an amount necessary to enable the
Secretary of War to carry into effcct the provisions?
of the foregoing section is hereby appropriated oat
of any moneys in the Treasury not otherwise appro-
priated.
Mr. COLE. That is legislation upon an
appropriation bill, to which there has been so
much objection from all parts of the Chamber
on former bills, and I do most earnestly object
to it on that account. I think this proposition
has no proper place on an appropriation bill.
I therefore move that it be laid on the table.
Mr. HARLA.N. I hope the Senator will not
make that motion now.
Mr. EDMUNDS, (to Mr. Harlan.) Do not
press the amendment; let us pass these bills.
Mr. HARLAN. It will not take more than
a few minutes.
Mr. EDMUNDS. It will take an hour to
explain it and oppose it.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If the Senator
from Iowa claims the floor, as he remained
standing while the amendment was being read,
he will be entitled to be heard on the amend-
ment. The Chair supposed that the Senator
from California rose to a question of order,
and for that reason recognized him.
Mr. COLE. I cannot make that point be-
cause the amendment was before the Commit-
tee on Appropriations.
The VICE PRESIDENT. And is reported
by a committee of the Senate?
Mr. COLE. Yes, sir.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Iowa is eijtitled to the floor.
Mr. HARLAN. It is not only recommended,
by the Committee on Indian Affairs, but has
been before the Committee on Military Affairs
in the form of a bill, and reported back favor-
ably by that committee, after having consulted
with the War Department, and I have on my
desk a copy of a letter from the Secretary of
War strongly recommending it, and also a letter
from tlie Secretary of the Interior recommend-
ing it. The military posts on the upper Mis-
souri river and the Indian agencies are iso-
lated. There is no telegraphy line connecting
them with the other telegraph lines of the coun-
try. The cost of this line, as estimated by
the War Depar ment, would be something over
two hundred dollars a mile in that part-of the
country. This amendment proposes to make
an advance of eighty dollars a mile if the Secre-
tary shall be able to make such a contract, and
if ill his opinion the public interest requires it.
There is nothing imperative in it, it in the
opinion of the Secretary it shonld not be re-
quired by the public service. Ihe amount of
money proposed is small, and the advantage
to be derived from the establishment of this
line would be very great. I am quitesure that
if the members of the Senate understood all
the facts in the case there would hardly be a
dissenting voice to the adoption of the amend-
ment. .
Mr. MORTON. I simply desire to say that
I have had my attention called to the'merits
of this proposition, and I aui satisfied that it
is an important one.
Mr. "WILLIAMS. What is the entire amount
of the appropriation ? How much money does
it involve? . . .
Mr. WILSON. About thirty-six or thirty-
eight thousand dollars. ...
Mr. HARLAN. That is, provided they build
the entire length.
Mr. WILLIAMS. I should like to inquire
if the Government has ever engaged in the
building of telegraphs ?
