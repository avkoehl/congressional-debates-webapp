HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., April 3, 1862.

General B. HUGER,

Commanding, Norfolk, Va.:

GENERAL: The Secretary of the Navy has stated to me this morning that he requires six or eight 9-inch guns to arm the gun-boats now under construction. Some are wanted immediately for a boat now at Mobile. He has heard that two of these guns are at battery near Norfolk, where they might be replaced with 32-pounders (fifty-seven hundred weight) without great detriment to the defense of the river. The 32-pounders he can supply. I desire to know whether you have any 9-inch columbiads that you could spare if replaced by 32-pounders. It is very desirable to give suitable arms to the gun-boats if it can be accomplished. He also states that if he could obtain from the Army sufficienti mechanics the boats for Albemarle Sound could be furnished in forty days. Can you aid him in this way and supply their places in the Virginia regiments by additional men from the militia, of which I learn you have or will have more than sufficient to fill each company to 100?*

I have the honor to be, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General, Commanding.
