Special Field Orders, Numbers 191, of yesterday. Your remaining division will, in accordance with General Sherman's Special Field Orders, Numbers 130, copy herewith inclosed,* encamp in convenient proximity to the Gulf railroad. To it will be intrusted the destruction of that road, as specified in General Sherman's order (Special Field Orders, Numbers 130). The Ogeechee bridge will not, however, be destroyed until a party has been sent across to secure the trains reported to be between Way's and Fleming's Stations.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

SAML. L. TAGGART,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. FIFTEENTH ARMY CORPS, Numbers 195. Anderson's Plantation, GA., December 11, 1864.

II. The following are the orders for the operations of the corps to-morrow: The First, Third, and Fourth Divisions will move, by the right flank, south of the King's Bridge and Savannah road, at 8 a. m., in the following order: Brigadier-General Corse, commanding Fourth Division, will move his entire command to the right, toward the railroad, as far as the conformation of the ground will permit, placing his brigades in double lines. He will cause, however, the regiments now on the railroad to remain in their present position. Brigadier-Generals Woods and Smith will close up, by the right flank, on General Corse's lines, respectively, and will place their troops on an alignment, with General Smith resting his left on the King's Bridge and Savannah road. The entire movement must be well screened from the view of the enemy, and division commanders will be careful in selecting their roads to attain that end. The present pickets or skirmish-line of the Fourth Division will remain until the three divisions are in position, when division commanders will relieve those on the right of the Savannah road in their respective fronts; those on the left of said road will remain until relieved by the Seventeenth Army Corps. Brigadier-General Hazen, commanding Second Division, will take up a reserve position west of the Little Ogeechee, covering well his flank and rear by pickets. He will furnish to Captain Reese, chief engineer of the army, the pioneer corps of his command, and all such details of men, teams, &amp;c., as may be necessary in the reconstruction of King's Bridge. All the teams and cattle will be ordered up to their respective divisions, and will be parked and corralled with a view to the convenience of forage. As the article will become very scarce during our stay, the greatest economy in the use of its is recommended, and the collecting and distributing of the same must be well systematized within the divisions to prevent waste. The regiments of General Woods' division now on guard at Dillon's Bridge will remain there and secure the said bridge by a tete-de-pont on the west side of the Ogeechee.

By order of Major General P. Joseph Osterhaus:

F. F. WHITEHEAD,Assistant Adjutant-General.
