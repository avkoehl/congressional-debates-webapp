eminent, that it might be administered for all, as it was
administered by the men who made it,"
. As will that made in his emancipation procla-
mation nearly eighteen months after the com-
mencement of the war, which is that thereafter,
as'theretofore, it would be prosecuted for the ob-
ject of practically restoring the constitutional re-
lations between the United States and the people
thereof, in which-States that relation was or might
l esuspended or disturbed, admitting in such mes-
sage that with candid men (and not confining such
admission to such of the slave States) there might
be uneasiness as to what would be the course of
liis administration toward the southern States
after the rebellion should have been suppressed,
and reassuring the people of every section of the
Union of full and equal protection then as ever;
and, in, such proclamation made some fourteen
months thereafter, declared that the -war that had
then been raging for near eighteen monthsshould
be prosecuted, as it had been, for the purpose of
practically restoring the constitutional relations
between the United States and the people of these
States, with which such relations had been sus-
pended or disturbed. Wot only by saying that
such relations had been suspended or disturbed,
holding that they had not been dissolved, and so
for from intimating that any of their rights had
been or could be forfeited, declared that the war
should be continued for the purpose of practically
restoring such relations, not only to the people
of the States then in the rebellion, by which they
had been suspended or disturbed, but to those
of arvy other States, the relations of which with
the Government might be so suspended or dis-
turbed, through n rebellion against the United
States. To any having any conception of such,
and a knowledge of this bill, an effort to show that
its every provision is subversive of the rights in-
cluded in such relations would seem superfluous.
Had I not demonstrated, as 1 believe I have, from
the President's inaugural, his message and assur-
ances in his emancipation proclamation, that he
regarded the rebellion as consequent upon the
apprehensions of those who became rebels, that
ine principles of selfand freegovernmentcontained
in the resolution of the Republican platform on
which he was elected, and reiterated in his inaugu-
ral, would be violated, and the provision of the
Constitution requiring the rendition of fugitives
from labor would be disregarded by him and those
of his party who, with him, would control the
administration of the Government during his term;
and that, notwithstanding their rebellion and the
war thereof, lie would protect them in the enjoy-
ment of such rights. The following, which he
directed the Secietary of State to say to our min-
ister to Great Jjiituin, in a dispatch of April 10,
1861, shows that he regarded the rebellion as so
consequent:
"It may be stated, perhaps, without giving just offense,
that the most popular motive in these discontents [refer-
ring to the rebellion] was an apprehension of designs on
the partot the incoming Federal Administration hostile to
the institution ot'donieslie slavery in the States wiieic it is
tolerated by local constitutions and laws. That institution
and Ihe class winch espeeially eherislies it are not confined
to the Hlates vvhieh have revolted, Inn llley exist in tile
eight other *o-callod slave States, and thevo lor that reason
sympathize piorbundly with the revolutionary movement.
(Sympathies and apprehensions of this kind have, for an in-
definite penod, entered into Ihe Ikim& of pelitieal parties
thiougliout Ihe whole country, and IhuscoiiMtleiable mattes
of peisons, Whose ultimate loyalty eould not be doubted
were found, even in the free States, either justifying, ex-
cusing, or palliating the movement toward disunion in the
seceding States." * * * * " It would be
very unjust to the American people to suppose that this
singular and unhappy eondition of tilings [alluding to the
rebellion} indicated any extieine favor or toleration of the
purpose oi'a permanent dissolution of the Union. On the
contrary, disunion at the very first look on a speeuous loan
aud it afterward made its way by ingenious and seductive
devices."
Will the Administration majority in this House
persist in recklessly multiplying and intensifying
the realities of such apprehensions by passing
this bill in violation of resolutions passed almost
unanimously by both Houses of Congress when
tinder the control of their political friends, in view
ot and since the commencement of the war, and
of pledges so solemn and important, made by their
President in such inaugural, his messages, in
executive documents, through his Secretary of
Slate, and otherwise, from time to time for near
eighteen I know, and think more than twenty,
months after the commencement of the war, es-
pecially as by the repeal of the fugitive slave law
this Administration has deprived a section of this
Union of a right the mere withholding of which
I have, from authoritative declarations of the Pres-
ident, shown he considered violative of the oath of
each member of Congress, and 1 think I have, that
he did, a moral cause for revolution? 1 thus speak
desiring a restoration of the Union, while prefer-
ring dissolution to permanent despotism under
any Union; I need not add as it was that of our
fathers,and thatof the Constitution,as the Union
is none other. While a Union may be a despot-
ism, yet such an one can be established on the dis-
ruption of this, only by deceiving the people into
the toleration of such an organization through
deceptive professions for the restoration of the
Union, and apparently sincere and enthusiastic
devotion to its institutions, and seeming desire to
restore them and reinvigorateits past glories, ren-
dered apparently sincere and dazzlingly and suc-
cessfully imposing by the display of our flag, the
singing of national airs and other patriotic songs,
and threatening and denouncing as traitors all
who may question the sincerity of such profes-
sions, devotion, and desire.
1 believe that without a change of Administra-
tion, or of its course, or unless the masses of the
Administration party shall so generally appre-
ciate the real political condition of the country
and the cause thereof as to constrain those to
whofn they have given power to exercise it in the
spi rit that actuated those who framed the Consti-
tution and administered the Government so long
and successfully, in strict accordance with its pro-
visions and as they promised to, that they might
attain such power, the Union will be dissolved or
such despotism established. Until such are con-
vinced that this Administration has, by repeated
violations of all the most important of the consti-
tutional rights of the people of each of the States,
justified the charges made by the most criminal,
sagacious, and malicious of the people of each of
the eleven States now in rebellion, and charges,
too, so serious as to have involved so many of them
of each of such States in the heinous crime of re-
bellion against aGovernmeritthat they, as a people
loved, and if administered on the basis of its organ-
ization, would desire to perpetuate with earth's
time, and to have produced a calamity to the peo-
ple of such States, on account of which, as Judge
Douglas said in the speech to which I have re-
ferred, he would rush to their rescue,and interfere
with whatever of strength he might possess to
defend them from, they will notattain such appre-
ciation, and may not in time to effect such restora-
tion and avert such disruption or despotism,as a
knowledge therefor would be incompatible with
the existence of their party, and consequently can
be obtained only against the unceasing, unrelax-
ing, and unscrupulous efforts of most of their lead-
ers. To one unacquainted with the professions
and purposes of most of the leaders of the party
of the Administration, the apprehensions and ex-
citement of the people of every State, consequent
upon the inauguration of the President, musthave
seemed strange, when all, as he said, professed to
be content with the Union if all their constitu-
tional rights could be maintained, the sincerity of
which he did notimpugn, butstated that they were
without reasonable cause.
And when the President instructed his Secre-
tary of State to say in a dispatch of 22d April,
1861, and after the attack on Fort Sumter on the
12th of that month,to ourminister to France, that
there was not then,even in the midst of the gath-
ering excitement of civil war, an American who
declared his dissent from the Constitution, and
assured them that the property, peace,and secu-
rity of no section should be in anywise endan-
gered by his Administration; and that all the
protection that consistently with the Constitu-
tion and laws could be given, would be, as cheer-
fully to one section as the other, and especially,
as the assurance comprehended all, thatany who
professed to be content in the Union with their
constitutional rights maintained, or had never
expressed dissent to the Constitution, should de-
sire; but would not so seem to those cognizant
that such popular purposes were professed to dis-
guise real and abhorrent ones. And why? Be-
cause they were aware of the President's decla-
ration, made at Springfield, Illinois, June 17,1858,
to a Republican convention that had just nom-
inated him as the opponentof JudgeDouglasfor
the Senate of the United States, which are:
" We are now far into the filth year since a policy was
initiated with the avowed object and confident promise of
putting an end to slavery agitation. Under the operation
of that policy that agitation lias not only not ceased, but
lias consuintiy augmented. In my opinion it will not cease
until aerisis shall iiave been reached and passed. 'A house
divided against itself cannotstand.' I believe this Govern-
ment cannot endure permanently half slave and half free.
I do not expect the Union to be dissolved ; I do not ex-
pect the house to fail; but I do expect it will cease to be
divided. It will become all one thing or all the other.
Either the opponents of slavery will airest the further
spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest
in the belief that it is in the course of ultimate extinction,
or its advocates will push it forward till it shall become
alike lawful in ail the States, old aa well as new, North
as well as South."
And after having been convinced of the hos-
tility of the majority of the people of that State
to such sentiments, and hearing the exposures of
Judge Douglas and others of them, said, (in a
speech made in such canvass, 10th July thereafter,
at Chicago:)
" Now, it is singular enough if you will carefully read
that passage [referring to what I have just quoted] that I
did not say that I was in favor of anything in it."
And that he, in that speech, said:
"We were often, (more than once, at least,) in the
course of Judge Douglas's speech last night, reminded that
this Government was made for white inen; that he be-
lieved it was made for white men. Well, that is (lulling it
into a shape in which no one wants to deny it."
Yet he, near the conclusion of the same speech,
says:
" My friends, I have detained you about as long as I de-
sired to do, and I have only to say, let us discard ail tills
quibbling about this man and the other man, this race and
tiiatrace and the other race being inferior, and therefore
they must be placed in an inferior position ; discarding our
standard that we have left us. Let its discard all these
things, and unite as one people throughout this land, un-
til we shall once more stand up declaring that all men are
created equal."
Thus, in the same speech, virtually admitting
that the Government was made for white men,
yet holding that it was cjuibbling to say that one
man or race was inferior to another, and must
therefore be placed in an inferior position, ad-
vised the discarding of the " standard" and " all
these things^referring to the Government having
been made for white men, and the inferiority in
which the negro was held, and admonished the
people to unite as one people throughout the land
until they should once more stand up declaring
that all men are created equal; and at Charleston,
in the south part of that State, where the senti-
ments of the quotation that I have last made from
him regarding the equality of the white and black
races were as unpopular as they were popular
at Chicago where he uttered them, he said in a
speech in such canvass, and immediately after
the commencing thereof, by stating in a very few
prefatory words, the importance of the assem-
blage giving attention to his speech:
" While I was at the hotel to-day, an elderly gentleman
called upon me to know whether 1 was really in favor of
producing a perfect equality between the negroes and white
people. While J had not proposed to myself on this occa-
sion to say much on that subject, yet as the question was
asked me I thought T would occupy perhaps five minutes iu
saying something in regard to it. J will say, then, that I am
not, nor ever have been, in favor of bringing about in any
way the social and political equality of the white and black
races; that I am not, nor ever have been, in favor of mak-
ing voters or jurors of negroes, nor of qualifying them to
hold office, nor to intermarry with white people; and I will
say in addititon to this that there is a physical difference
between the white and black races which I believe will for-
ever forbid the two races living together on terms of social
and political equality. And inasmuch as they cannot so
live, while they do remain together there must be the posi-
tion of superior and inferior, and I, as much as any other
man, am in favor of having the superior position assigned
to the white race."
In view of the occasion of the utterance of such
sentiments as were by the Presidentat Spingfield,
which was to a State convention of the Repub-
lican party which had adopted a platform and
just nominated him as the candidate of that party
for the Senate of the United States, in response
to and in acceptance of which the speech con-
taining them was made, and of their importance
by reason of their monstrosity consequent upon the
declaration therein, that the Goverment could not
exist as formed; and of the relation of the speaker
to the convention and the country, and the high
position assigned him by those to whom he thus
