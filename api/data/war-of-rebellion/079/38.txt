turned this way. I don't think Forrest would divide his force in presence of such a heavy column; he has thus far held his command well in hand. I am satisfied myself that he was in persons six miles from this place on the night of the 29th at or near the Pulaski road. I start a party of troops this morning to repair road to Decatur.

HUNTSVILLE, October 2, 1864.

Major-General THOMAS:

Mr. Cropland, who left Elkton yesterday for this place, reports to me that about 1,800 rebels, he should judge, passed him at Madison cross-roads, about fifteen or sixteen miles from Athens, on their way to that place; took from him his mule and buggy. Some time after that another regiment passed, who reported that they had this place; that when two miles and a half of this place he was signs of a train having passed, with large signs of cavalry accompanying it; that he heard firing at Athens up to 10 o'clock to-day. Mr. Cropland is reported to me as being a very reliable man.

R. S. GANGER,

Brigadier-General.

HUNTSVILLE, October 2, 1864-5. 15 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS:

General Morgan's force is just passing out from here, I am afraid too late to be of service at Athens. You may not be aware that General Morgan ranks me and that he has control of the entire expedition in pursuit of Forrest.

Brigadier-General.

(Received 7. 30 p. m.)

Major-General THOMAS:

The following report has just been received: Athens was attacked yesterday by a portion of General Forrest's command at 3 p. m. General Buford's command, well equipped with artillery, resumed attack this morning; cannonading very severe between 6 and 8 a. m. to-day. Lieutenant-Colonel Wade, with his regiment, Seventy-THIRD Indiana, which I sent there by your order to reoccupy the place, repulsed the enemy handsomely; he moved off in the direction of Elk River, Major McBath, with 200 Second Tennessee Cavalry, pursuing.

R. S. GRANGER.
