Next week I purpose to accompany the Governor to the lower counties, and look into matters there. During the week i have sent 2 men to Fort Delaware for treasonable language-one of them, William Bright, of Wilmington, a man of some position; and thus making him an example is undoubtedly doing good to the community. I think political asperity is wearing away here, and another victory will make Delaware a very loyal State.

With great respect, your obedient servant.

DAN. TYLER,

Brigadier-General.

FORT MONROE, July 11, 1863.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have embarked and sent you since yesterday morning 12, 000 troops. * I shall send 1, 000 immediately, and 3, 000 more as soon as General Getty reaches Norfolk. He has marched all the way from the White House. I expect him here to-night; at farthest to-morrow morning.

Respectfully,

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I sent you a dispatch by mail this evening, the telegraph line by Cherrystone being interrupted, in which there was a mistake. Please accept this instead of it. Ten thousand men have been sent you since yesterday morning. I shall send from 4, 000 to 5, 000 more; enough, with Spinola's brigade, to make about 17, 000.

I am waiting for transportation. Expect transports to-night.
