COLLIERSTOWN, December 19, 1863 - 8.30 a. m.

Major General J. A. EARLY,

Staunton:

GENERAL: Owing to the telegraphic dispatch received last night from Lynchburg I have determined to move my command across the country to Buchanan and get on Averell's rear. If you can stop up the route by Covington and Callaghan's and the road by Lewisburg can be closed, I think that he will be taken. I take this route so that if he returns to Salem, as the dispatch indicates, and attempts to go south I can still be after him.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

P. S. - I have ordered any troops that you may have sent from Staunton to Lexington, in accordance with a suggestion of mine, to halt until they hear from you, as you may need them to stop up the Covington route, and they will not be able to keep up with me.

[29.]

COLLIERSTOWN, December 19, 1863 - 8.30 a. m.

General F. H. SMITH,

Lexington, Va.:

GENERAL: Read the accompanying dispatch* and forward it on to General Early as soon as you can. Let your corps go on to Buchanan, as first ordered. I have sent an order to stop any troops that may be coming from Staunton to Lexington, as General Early may need them to throw across to Millborough to put in the vicinity of Covington to stop that road up.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FITZ. LEE,

Major-General, Commanding.

Please direct the courier you send to give the accompanyin gto any commanding officer he may meet on the road from Staunton to Lexington.
