exchange. I informed General Burnside that General Wool had proposed commissioners from the two Government should meet and make all arrangements for exchange; that I expected an immediate answer from my Government, to whom General Wool's proposal had been referred, and "I therefore propose to avoid confusion that the equivalent of rank agreed upon by the regularly appointed commission be adopted by us in the present exchange. "

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Honorable J. P. BENJAMIN, Secretary of War.

SIR: In reply to your letter ofFebruary 14 received yesterday I have to say that Lieutenant Dickinson, U. S. Army, was exchanged for Lieutenant Tattnall, and General Wool informed that Lieutenant Jones would be sent for Lieutenant Sayre. As soon therefore as Lieutenant Jones is sent to Fort Monroe Lieutenant Sayre will be released from his parole. In regard to your letter of the 23rd ultimo I was mistaken as to the exchanges made and asked for one lieutenant too many, who, however, was not sent.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Major-General, Commanding.

SIR: First Lieutenant T. M. R. Talcott, senior engineer officer in this department, was captured at Roanoke Island. As he is in the Confederate Army I proposed to General Wool to exchange him for First Lieutenant William E. Merrill, U. S. Engineer Corps. I have General Wool's reply agreeing to the exchange, and I beg that Lieutenant Merrill may be forwarded to General Wool for this purpose.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. HUGER,

Considerable many of the Fort Donelson soldiers who have escaped are passing through here all going to their native places. Most of them have arms. They act as though they were deserting.
