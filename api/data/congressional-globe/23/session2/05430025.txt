THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

if another sitting of the Chambeis shall be closed
without definitive actior upon the subject—but
he does not attempt to pieseube 01 to intimate
the time ot mannei of its being done, and only
assures Congress that its decision shall be faith
fully executed, as far as it shall authorize him to
act By his language, Mi W undeistood, and
so he believed the whole nation "would under
stand the Piesident to say—not having shunned
the responsibility of making the recommendation,
I am sincere in the deteimination not to shun the
responsibility of executing the decision of Con-
gress, whatever that may be
And as for having recommended reprisals in
the event of the Trench Chambe a again refusing
to executf the stipulations in thi tieaty, those
who may dislike such a couise should lcmembei
that i eprisals, oi a tame acquiescence m the refusal,
are all that we shall hav e 1< "t to us—short of war
llepnsals, though sometimes leading to war are
more frequently the means of preventing it In
this case, will it not be so' Por, besides the
just cause w h ch we shall have for íesortmg to
it, we have the honor of the King of the three
days, tnat he diffeis fiom the Chambers in his
sense of the obligations imposed upon I lance by
the tre ity and without a declaration of wai by
himself, it cannot be made by France So much,
Ml W deemed it right to say, m regald to the
message, in reply to the misconceptions of it by
his colleague, and in answer to his apprehensions
of war
But there weie two points of view in which the
subject was piesented to the House, and from the
mere intimation of them it would be obvious that
it should be sent to a committee, untiammeled
bv instructions The fust were the lights whicn
our citizens had acquned under the tieaty, and,
secondly, what national honor would lequire fiom
Congress, if the FrenUi Chambers persevered in
lefusing to execute it If the amendment pit
vailed, it would be equivalent tj a postponement
by Congress of the rights of oui citizens The
subject should be fully cam assed by a committee,
and afteiwaids, upon its íeport, by Congress,
that oui meichants might feel and know, that
their pursuits wcie undei the vigilant guardian-
ship oí Congress, and that all the woild might
see, howevti long it may be delayed by circum
stances, that there was to be a day of retnbution
for every outrage upon our commerce, undei
whatevei pretense, oi by whatevei nation it might
be committed The sense of this stcuuty will
give life to oui entcipnse in eveiy clime, and con
fidence to our mariners upon e\ciy sea In this
instance, the subject should be sent to a commi -
tee witnout instructions, that it might dehbei ately
lnquue and report that com so which Congicss
should take as the best fitted to induce Fiance to
fulfill her obligation, oi what will most success
fully accomplish the pui pose, should it be thought
advisable, now oi heieaftei, to íediess ouiselves
But I do not propose to argue this point at this
time     The  mtimation of it is enough to insure
the rejection of the amendment      As to what
national honoi   would  ltquirt, if Fiance peisc
veied m   hei  course, and  definitely lefused to
recognize oui rights  mdei th   tieaty, ind^dso to
make repaiationtor het dolavin doing it, Mr W
was not mistaken when he said, theie wouhi be
but one sei timent among the American people
as to the couise tobe pui sued   It would nolongci
be a question of doll irs and cents, but of national
honoi, demanding eveiy sacufice of money and
of life to maintain it, w ith the superadded obh
gation to sustain all that the laws of nations re
quned in legaid to tieaties     The cause would
not only be ouis, but th it of eveiy nation having
trt titles, oi winch mvyhavc to make treaties, with
Fianc-      Mr   "W   would  not pursue this topic
He had thought it to be his tlutj   fiom the iela-
tion m which he had been pi iced to the House,
to mak   some lemaiks upon the amendmentpio
posed by his colleague  and upon his speich, that
the publie might be advised of the true state of our
affairs with  Fiance, and to prevent the message
from being misconceived by those w ho might k ad
the rem u ksofhis colli ague   The oidmary course
was, to ltlei subjects bearing on oui foieigniela
tions to the Committee on Foreign Affans   Why
do so, it the committee vv is to be locked up by
mstiuctions  wmeh took fiom  it  th   tieedom of
debbeiation   and   confined   them to   report   the
judgment of an individual?    His colleague had
expressed himself in a speech professing much
benevolence, and full of apparent patriotism, but
the course he proposed, if countenanced by the
House, would compromise the mteiest of alaige
class of Ills fellow citizens, by adding to the toi
cign obstacles already in the way of the payment
of their claims, all the prejudices of party at home
But ho would say no moie, foi he was convinced
the lmpiopuety of his colleague's movement
would be manifested by an almost unanimous
ícjection of the amendment, without furthei de-
bate                                              9
Mi ARCHER suggested to the mover to vv ith
draw his amendment The piescnt was not the
propel time to discuss this subject An oppoi
tunity would be afforded, when the committee
should makeaitpoit If the motion was pi essed,
he must vote against it
Mi CL W TON rose in reply H  said he was
sorry he could not accept the suggestion of t le
honorable gentleman fiom Vnginia, for whom he
enteitained irieat respect He consideiel this
one of those occasions on which to be found m a
mmonty of one would be to occupy one of the
proudest stations which any man could hold
He would leave it to the nation and to posteuty
to say, whethei it was not well done, to endeavor
to picvent that excitement, and the rousing of all
those feelings of embitteied hostility which
would be at once let loose should the House in
any dcgiee sanction the views suggested in the
executive communication He would ask gen
tlemen whethei they were not as well piepaicd
now as thev would be after a íeport was lendeied,
tojudge on the expediency of tne course pioposed>
The s ep he had taken was no unusual one
Two months of the last session had been occu
pied m debating a proposition intioduced in pic-
ciscly the same way "What (he asked) would
be gamed by sending this subject to the Commit
tte on Toieign Affans ? Had not the House all
the documents before them5 Weie they not
printed, and on the table of every member? All
the committee wou d 1 ave btfoie them, the House
had befoieit Theiewas no ambiguity of mean
mg the whole case was as plain as the commit
tee could make it
He was willing  so  far  to  comply with the
wishes of his friend from Virginia as to postpone
the subject foi a week     But why waitfoi a long
íeport when they could as well judge and act
without it?    If the House was ready at once to
reject his proposition, the natuialmfeience would
be, that there was a majority in that House dis
posed and ready to go to war with France    The
gentleman (lnscolleigue) fiom Georgia,it seemed,
could see nothing hostile, nothing of war, or war
like, in the message of the President    But Mi
C would appeal to the common sense of any
man to say, whether the language of the mes
sage did not contain a menace
"I lecommend that a law be passed authon
'zing repu-als upon Fiench piopeity, m  case
'piovisio i shall not be made for the payment of
' the debt at the ipproaching session of the Tiendi
'"Chambeis "
Here the Pr< sident insisted that but one session
moie of the Chimbéis shall be peimitted to pass,
till letteis of marque and reprisal shall be issued
by this GoTcniment Who did not know that
the iii st act of íepnsal would be consideied by
Frince as an act of hostility, and met on hcipart
with instant íetaliation > As to the in erest of the
Amencan claimants, to which the chanman of
the Committee on Foreign Aft urs had alluded,
Mi C 's pioposition was manifestly safei for
them than the mcasuie of the Piesident The
moment we went to war, the claims were gone
When the clouds and smoke of w arcleaied iway
the claims would all vanish with them When
ever peace was proposid, the whole would be
sacnficed What he wanted, w as to give to the
people of France the evidence that the people of
Amenca weie not disposed to go to wai with
them tint we inspected them as friends, md
desned otheis to remain filends If he thought
that a long report (hovvevei able) fiom the
Committee on Foreign <Vffurs w ould throw any
new lisht upon the matter, he would willingly
wait for it, but he could not believe but that the
Hous was as leady now is it w ou d he then
Could it be the vish the dfign of am gentk
man, to thiow this agitating question abioid and
ious  the i ational feeling into a *ta e of re^ur1  
tion? He ti usted not He was sorry that he
could not withdiaw his motion, he was willing,
however, to defer the subject foi a week, as he
had said, or even foi a foitnrght, if gentlemen
insisted   faither he could not go
Mi JOHNSON, of Kentucky, said, the gentle-
man from Georgia assumed, at the thicshold, that
the recommendation of the Piesident was a prop-
osition to declaie wai Ho certainly did not so
consider it, nor did the President himself The
code of civ ihzed nations expressly recognizes tho-
ught of íepnsal in a nation fiom which a just
debt is withheld, as a mode of redress compitióle
with the continuance of peace But 'he President
does not piopose even this redi ess slioit of war,
but under circumstances which the gentleman
from Giorgn says, would render an appeal to
arms not only just, but indispensable to piesirve
the " national honoi " for which he is prepaied to
make ten thousand tunes gieatei sacrifices than
he has depicted as necessarily lesulting fiom wai
He says oui claims on Trance aie just—that we
have not asked a cent more than is just—that the
treaty stipulates for nothing moie than is just—
and that a refusal to execute it is ' a just cause of
war " Well, the Fiench Chamber of Deputies
have definitively and positively refused to pay
the money which the nation has bound itself, by
the most solemn of all obligations, to pay The
Chambers, after successive sessions of" elaborate
discussion and long dehbeiation, have defeated the
stipulations of the treaty, by the rejemon of the
proposition of the King of the French to piovide
for the payment of our demands The Piesident
of the United States, however, in communicating
this fact to Congress, does not call upon us to act
upon this peremptory lefv-sal as " a just cause of
war " He does not ask that we should considei
this violation of the faith of treaties, and insult to
our national honor,as making jmopei an immedi-
ate appeal for rcdiess to the lemedy of reprisals,
of which the late example of Fiance, in regard to
Portugal, affoids a piactical lllustiation No—
the Piesidint proposes a course of gi eater moder-
eiation than the pnnciples avowed by the gentle-
! man fiom Geoigia, and the late piecedent set by
France heiself most cleaily justify and invite
The message would have us overlook the wrong
aheadv inflicted, and the affront offered m ttfe
fiist absolute iefusal of the Fiench Chambers to
comply with the tieaty It pioposes, m the event
of a second denial of justice by the newly elected
Chambers, that then only shall the violation of
the t-eaty be regarded as conclusive, and as shut-
ting the door against a hope of voluntary tedies 
on the part of France, and even aftei this con-
summation of wrongs which have lemamed twen-
ty five yeais unrediessed, the President does not,
in his communication to us, hold the strong lan-
guage of the gentleman fiom Georgia, and say
that it forms " a just cause of war, ' but only in
sists that it is it ¡list cause jor repináis—that is,
that we should take possess,on of as much Fiench
property as would be sufficient to pay the sum
stipulated m the treaty and, aftei n taming it a
sufficient length of time to give the Fiench Gov
ernment an opportunity to ledeemit, bv the pay
ment of the sum acknowledged to be due to our
citizens, that it should be confiscated, as the prop
erty of our people was by h i anee twenty fiv e years
ago
It is prematuie,howevei, toenter into this dis-
cussion now The House has before it a mass
of documents It w as its dutv , through its com
nittee, to sift them thoroughly,and look into all
the bcaungs of tne case No man enteitained
more friendly feelings towards Fiance (he said)
than he did, ard none would be moie unwilling
hastily to sevei the ties of the ancient friendship
which has existid between Fiance and the In ited
States He would obseive all the foms which
ar introduced into legislation, for the pmpostof
giving due d&hbeiation to all pro< tiding in this
delicate subject The haste with which the gui
tli man would rush into a discussion and decision
of the greit and impo'tant subject was neitliei
respectful to those who admimstei the Govern-
ment of Franco, nor to oui own Administration
The President, as we have seen, wishes the final
action of this Government, to await the final de-
teimination of the French Chambeis Ind time
can, theiefore, be no motive for the precipite Hon
with which we are invited to expiess an opinion
«   *" the intentions of the Fiench Government
