belongs to General Stevenson. Think Colonel Rowett, Seventh Illinois Mounted Infantry, ought to be sent out in the direction of Florence. I have just seen General Stevenson, and he has no reliable information that the enemy is concentrating cavalry and infantry at Florence.

ATHENS, May 12, 1864.

Colonel SAWYER, Assistant Adjutant-General:

Colonel Rowett's scouts report that the infantry of enemy have recrossed the Tennessee River, leaving their cavalry on this side foraging the country. I shall send all the cavalry I have to Florence, instructed not to return until the force of the enemy and their purpose [are ascertained], if possible.

ATHENS, May 12, 1864.

Brigadier General J. E. SMITH:

Colonel Rowett says he can't move in the morning with more than 200 horsed. One hundred of his men are picketing Elk River, and fifty have gone to Huntsville with cattle. General Stevenson said he would send the Ninth Ohio Cavalry up here in the morning to go with Colonel Rowett. Think they had better be ordered here at once, and I will see that they get off without delay. Shall I send Rowett at once or wait for the Ninth Ohio?

Brigadier-General.

MAY 12.
