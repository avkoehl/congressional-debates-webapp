THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

reduced to forty acres? It is not probable that
the women and children exerted themselves to
save the lives of white people, but it was done by
chiefs, and heads of families, and young1 Indians
who are styled braves or warriors. I think the
provision is welt enough as it is. I think we
should reward Indians who, under the circum-
stances that surrounded this case, exerted them-
selves to protect the white inhabitants. This was
the opinion of the committee—or of several mem-
bers of the committee, I know—that they ought
to be rewarded, ought to be distinguished from
other Indians, as an inducement to Indians here-
after, when the tribes should conclude to engage
in war with the white people, to frustrate the de-
signs and plans of the tribe, to give timely noticc
to the settlers. I am not sure, however, but that
the word " themselves," in the fifth line of the
section, ought to be stricken out, and the word
" himself" inserted. I submit this to the chair-
man of the committee.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. I think that would be
proper.
Mr. HARLAN. It would then be confined to
the men who have thus exerted themselves.
Mr. DOOLITTLE. 1 have received from the
Commissionerof Indian Affairs a statement made
by the head men and braves of some of these In-
dian tribes, which, with the accompanying certifi-
cates, I will read to the Senate:

Sir : I herewith transmit petition oi the Sioux Indium,
and letter of A^ont Galbiaith, "iving a lair statement ot
facts as they occurred in my pioeii'-e.
The Indians whose name-j appear to this mention have
been true and loyal, and should not bo putu-hed lor tin"*
sins of others. Thev ate now without home-- oi tne-ms of
earning a living. Tueir expectations, ba-ed upon tiiousk
and danger they inclined in saving the wiau > in tin: late
outbreak, have not been ie,ihz*;ii. Thiv -uppos-i d iv
whites would bo grateful and ptovult' fnr'theni, unci a^k
that their inteiest.-. may be considered, and ihat iluy may
not be dnven oft* with the wild or •-av.i^e Indian-, who
would treat thorn as badly iw they h:ivv touted the white-,.
Thev are of the tarmei I udian-, and could do much low aid ;
raising their own living, it allow et' to go back to theirJarms
and be pioteof' d in th< h penc< uMc po^e-MOn of them, and
this .should be done hi time to allow them to get in then
crop-* m f^navui next spunir.
The manner in which rh'T have acred towards the
wlnfci ought to entitle them to a I'nv.itd ovor and above
their benefits arising from their tieaty .-dipulatious. They
manifest adesiietodo auj thing 01 go anywhere the De-

THOS. J. GALBRAITH,
United States Jigcnt,
(!uri{ W. Thompson, Issq.,
Superintendent fndlan Jlffaiift, St. Paul,
We, chiefs and head men of the Mindevvakant< ns and
Wahpetons and Sis etons, Sioux ot the M^i^ipi)!, make
this book (petition) toom great Grandfather, the Piesiiiciu
of the United States:
La^t August our young men all broke out and butcheied
agieat many white m(vn and women and elnkhen. The
cause that they did this was that many of us had com-
menced to live as white men, and they wete jealousot us;
and on that account they went to war. We who make this
book telt bad for this, and opposed it; but we weie tew,
and they were many, and we could not prevent them. We
did all we could. \Ve did not go to war. V/c killed no-
body. We helped to save the captive -, and we succeeded
m saving neaily three hundied white women and children,
and Othei Day saved our agent's l'amilj and all the whites
at the Yellow Medieme, si.uj-hvo in all. Paul,or Maza-
kutamune, and Loienzo, and Anawabmani, oi Simon, al-o
sa\ed many white women and children.
We did uohauu.and tried to do good. We know out
young men, and many of our old men, have bioken the
treaty, and we all ieel bad. We aie tanneis, and want that
our gicat Father would allow us to hum again whenever
he pleases, only we never want to go away with the wild
blanket Indians again; for v hat wc have done for the
whites they would kill us. We of the Upper Sioux would
like to go to live on the Couteau des Prame, fifteen miles
west of Big Stone lake, in Dakota Tetutoty; and we of
the Lower Sioux would like to go back on our fauns, and
there live as white men, or we would like to live anion"
the white men, and laim as the) do, if they would let
Us.
Wc think we ought to he dealt with as our great Father
does with his white elnldien: the bad ought to be punished,
and the good to be well treated. All the"Indians who were
engaged in killing the white men and women and elnldien
should be hanged; but we who did not do bad hope to
live, and we ask our great Father to let u-> live and to aid
us. We think wc have not forfeited oui annuities or othei
funds, because we have done no wiong; and we a.-lc that
oui gieat Father will u-e so much as belongs to us, iu
such way as to him seems he-t for our good, to help u.-,
to live, and as much u? belong-* to llie bud Indians wo
would hkc to ha\e our gieat Father pay out ju--t debts out
of; and it is in light liiat the white people wiio have lo-t ail
their pioperty should be paid out uf the money which was
the Sioux
We humbly and respectfully a-k that our gieat Fathei
take pity on us and do as he thinks best loi our good We
must have 1'ood and clothing, and in the spiingsoiu< whoie
toh\e. La-t f,puu<.'oui agent brought us a gieat many
plows and hoc.s and iron and otherlhings, and we want that
he should pay for thesij tilings out of our money. We want
evciythiuir we owe paid.
We respecttul!y ask ihut our gieat Fathei appropriate our
annuity money, and that of tho-e whom we repw^ent. tir-t.
to pay oui debih eieated by our agent. Majoi Galbiaith;
second, to pay damage-* ; and last, to aid us 111 getting u
living. Wi. are heie at Foit Suelhng. toity-one Lowi r
Sioux Indians,and tvveuij (Jpj)ei Sioux Indians, ami about
fifteen hundied women and elnldien, and twenty balr-bieed
men. We know not what to do, and wc submit ouiselves
into the hands of our gieat Father.

ANTOINE FRENIERE,
United States Interpreter,
December 13, 1862.
I desire to say one word, as I am on this point,
about the breaking outof this Indian war, to show
that, in my opinion, our Government has entered
upon a policy in reference to the Indian tribes,
which is utterly wioog. Down to 1851 what-
ever annuities or presents we made to the In-
dian tribes we made to the chiefs, and then the
chiefs made the distribution; and so long as
the chiefs held the money, and the blankets, and
the ammunition, and the rifles, the young men
would look up to the chiefs; but after 1851, we en-
tered upon the policy that the Government agents
should distribute all our annuities among the indi-
vidual Indians, and what was the necessary re-
sult? An individual Indian would look down
upon his chief and say, "lam ptst as j^ood as you
are; I deal with thei*ieat Father lnmsulf, tluough
his agent; I ^ot my money, my blankets, my
inlcs, my ammunition, direct from the Govern-
ment ; you have no control over me." The result
of it has been the breaking down of the tribal
authority of the chiefs jn those nations, and the
breaking down of their form of government among
themselves, so that the chiefs no longer restrain
the young men, and they go mto war. timce 1851,
more depredations have been committed by the
Indian tribes than thiough the whole history of
the Government befoie.
In my opinion, it has grown as much outof that
as out of any other one fact, that the Government
itself has broken down their tribal organization
by making this distiibution among the individ-
uals. Here are, among the chiefs and the old men
of the tribes, many thatendeavored to restiain the
young men from going to war in Minnesota. I
think it will be good policy for us to offer to give
to these persons one hundred and sixty acies of
land each, and to pay fifty dollats a head to them so
long as they live, for lescumg the people of Min-
nesota and saving their wive.s and then daughteis
fi oil! matsaci e, oi, what is a thousand times worse
than death itself, fioni being ravished by these
brutal monsteis, as many of them were during
that savage warfaie. It is doing no more than we
ought to do; and'I think that the section, as pro-
posed by the committee, ougiit to stand, giving to
the individual Indian the one hundred and sixty
acres and a pension of fifty dollars a year for his
life.
Mi. FESSENDEN. *1 shall move to strike out
the part that relates to pensions. That is intio-
ducing an entire new system. Whatever is given,
I hope will be given m the shape of land.
i\lr. RICE. Thp President, m his reeent mes-
sage to Congress, called the attention of Congress
particularly to the subject of remodeling the In-
dian laws,and J have been waiting very patiently
for Use Commniee nri Indian Affairs to mtioduce
a bill for that purpose. A vital change is abso-
lutely necessary. So long as we m our treatment
ofthe Indians violate a positive injunction ofHoly
Writ, or induce them to \iol<ite it, they will con-
tinue to die out. I believe the good book says
that man shall earn his living by the sweat of his
brow. Every inducement possible is held out to
the Indians by this Government not to work. If
you were to take citizens from the eastern States,
and put together one or two hundred of them, or
one or two thousand, on the plains, and treat them
as we treat the Indians, in five years they would
become savages themselves. There is no induce-
ment heid out to the Indian to labor. He lives
