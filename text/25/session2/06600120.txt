seven or eight thousand dollars of its own notes in
circulation, so that it is wholly protected from any
demands that can come against it. These immenbe
resources of the Merchants Bank, amounting to
about one million six hundred thousand dolíais,
appear to have been accumulated by putting into
circulation the dead notes of the late Bank of the
United States, which neither the Merchants Bank
nor the Pennsylvania Bank is bound to redeem
It appears by a report of a committee of the Senate,
which has just been read, that the bank has now m
circulation more than six millions of these dead
notes, which it is not bound to redeem, and still
has about twenty millions in its possession, to be
used as it may have occasion The putting off of
these notes is a gross fraud on the laws of the
UniteTl States and on the public, and I rejoice that
the committee have reported a bill making it an
indictable offence, punishable by fine and impri-
sonment.
This soulless corpofation, in the war it is cany-
íng on against the Government and the current},
acts on true military principles It has it".
strong fortress and principal force at Philadel-
phia, but establishes posts at advantageous points,
where it throws m a strong force to watch and
overawe the State banks, and keep up a ha
rassmg fire upon them, if they presume to
act in a way not in strict compliance with the
wishes of this great bank autocrat Tins insti-
tution, which declared "that it intended 10 tale the
lead in resumption," is now, it seems to be ad-
mitted on all hands, the principal, ii not the sole,
obstacle to that measure It controls all the banks
in Philadelphia, and through the Merchants Bank,
intends to control the banks at New Orleans This
is securing two important points, and it is now at-
tempting to overawe the banks in New York which
are disposed to resume, and have, m the true spirit
of bank vassals, beseeched the great autociat to
consent to it He treated their ambassadors polite-
ly, and feasted them, but refused to give his con-
sent that the New York banks might resume pay-
ing their debts, and doing business on honest pun-
tapiés. The object of this institution no one can
doubt. It desires to prolong the present state ot
things to favor its mercantile and moneyed opera-
tions, and to bring the people of the Umti IStatts,
through their "suffenngs," to consent to ristore
and rechaiter that institution as a National Pink,
with the monopoly of the public revenues
It remains to be known whether a single institu-
tion can control the entire banking system oí all
the States Such is the condition of the banks
with regard to the íesumption oí specie payments—
controlled by a single institution Under circum-
stances like these, would it be wise or safe to con-
nect our financial interests with a banking system
like this?
But, sir, the banks do not resume the payment
of their notes, and many of them are breaking 1)
it is not owing to the opposition of the Pennsylv a-
ma Bank of the United States, why do they not re-
sume? The causes of their suspension are pasi,
exchange is below pai, the demand foi spei le, for
exportation, has entirely ceased, and jet the banks
refuse to resume. How can the public, or this
Government, place confidence m them whilst they
remain m this situation'!
Some few banks have already resumed, and
others may follow; the banks may resa me in <ne
section of the Union and not m others, this was the
case during the late war and in 18] 8 and 'M The
condition of the banks, and the currency they sup-
ply, is, and probably will be, very diffeient in tht
several sections of the country For this Govern-
ment, then, to connect its financial affaiu with
them, is not to do equal and exact justice to the
debtors and creditors of the United States, in all
parts of the country I have before me a state-
ment of the present depreciation of the notes of
what are regarded as solvent banks of the different
States, m the city oí New York, as compared with
the notes of the banks of that city, they being from 3
to 4 per cent, below specie The bills of the banks
in Mame, New Hampshire, Vermont, Masspchu-
setts, and Rhode Island, are at a discount of 24 per
cent., those of Connecticut from h to 2k, Philadel-
phia 2, other Pennsylvania banks 3 to 4, Balti-
more 3, District of Columbia 3, Virginia 3 to 4,
North Carolina 5 to 6, South Carolina 4 to 5,
Georgia 5 to 6, Florida 12 to 15, Alabama 8 to 10,
Louisiana 5 to 7, Mississippi 12 to 15, Tennessee
15, Kentucky 5 to 6, Illinois 7 to 8, Indiana 7 to 8,
Ohio 6 per cent This difference m the local bank-
currencies is owing, in part, to the suspension of
specie payments by ihe banks, but is by no means
wholly to be ascribed to that cause, as all have sus-*
pended It is mainly attributable to the balance of
trade, and the amount of the issues of the banks
As the payment of specie has long been only
nominal, th s bank currency has been of different
values atall times Tins is the casein England,where
the notes of the Bank of Englandhave a monopoly
of the circulation m London and sixty miles round
it if that bank does not increase its issues when the
joint stock banks m Ihe country towns do, the cur-
rency m Lancashne and other counties depreciates
below tint in London
All this goes to prove, that for the United States
to collect ana pay out any thing but specie, or us
own ciedit, is to have several standards in the col-
lection ot its revenuesand thepa}mentsof its debts.
It violates the spuit of that provision in the Consti-
tution, which lequires that all duties and imports
shall be uniform throughout all the States.
But, sn, 1 have not done with the present condi-
tion ol the banks, and must beg the indulgence of
the Senate to go into some details I have some
facts on this subject, some "crumbs of comfort for
the chickens of the bank covenant," if I maybe al-
lowed to use the quaint language of a former age
I ha\e aheady alluded to some of the banks at
New Orleans, and now propose to notice them a lit-
tle more m detail, not that I think the banks theie
are in a worse condition than many others, as we
ate told not to regaid those on whom the tower ol
Saloarn fell as smneis above all other men
Theie aie m New Orleans sixteen banks, with a
caput!, said to be paid m, of 37,000,000 of dollars
In June laM. their entire discounts on personal se-
curity amounted to .¡4,080,000 dollars, their jpecie
to 2,000,000, being seventeen dolíais in bills to one
in specie By an investigation lately made, by the
authority ol the Legislature, it appears that twenty-
nine dmciois of eight of the banks, or houses, in
which those directors weie concerned, had received
lo ms to the amount of nearly 7,000,000 dollars,
being mure thin one-fifth of the entire loans in that
gieil lommoTcia! city This shows, m what sense
tin banks constitute the people li the few indivi-
duals whoduect them, and monopolize themselves
a lnige portion of their funds., constitute the people,
then the banks are the people, and to sepa ate the
Government from the banks, will be to separate it
from the people
We have already noticed the condition of the
Merchants Bank, and the power which it holds
over six, and, in a less degree, over all the other
banks in New Orleans Ihe New Orleans banks,
at the time of their suspension, had 10,429,210 dol-
íais in pi (tested notes, of which theie has since been
paid! 151,487 dollars By their own statement of
tl en allurs in June, there appeared to be a defi-
cient y in their a* its to the amount of 3,715,000
dollars
Tne Legisl lture of the State of Indiana have
lately atttmh led to investigate the affairs of the
Slate Bank and its branches, in which the State is
a large stockholder This attempt appears to have
been resisted at fust, and the president of the bank
di clared that ?n investigation would not be benefi-
cial eitl i to the bank or the Siate, or words to that
eff-ct Jlowevct, an investigation appears to have
been made, at least into three of its branches, In-
dianapolis, Lawrencebuigh, and Lafayette It
appeared irom this examination that these banks
ha\ e been little better than mere shaving-shops
All of them had adopted the practice of declining
to discount notes payable at the bank, and confined
their operations to the discount of Mes, or bills
drawn on individuals or banks, when it was well
known that the drawer had no funds m the hands
of the drawee, and that he expected to take up the
draft himself, and at the bank where discounted
Oa these bills a discount was taken, under a pre-
tence of exchange, of from eight to thirteen per
cent    Some or all of those banks have been in the

practice of purchasing the depreciated bills of other
States, at a discount of from two to five per cent,
and passing them off at their counter at par.
Whilst these banks were refusing to discount to
others, except by shaving bills, the directors helped
themselves to a large share of the funds of the
banks At the Lawrenceburgh branch, the loans
to the directors, individually, and as partners of
firms, averaged fifty-five thousand dollars, and, at
the other branches, directors had drawn out from
forty to sixty thousand dollars. A rule was* adopted
giving to stockholders loans to the full amount of
their stock, which was afterwards extended to fifty
per cent, beyond their stock Under this rule, the
favorite of the directors offered Ins note, say for
five hundred dollars, with which he purchased five
hundred dollars of stock, and when this note fell
due, he lodged another note for seven hundred and
fifty dollars, with which he took up his first note,
and had two hundred and fifty dollars left, except
the discount This was certainly a convenient way
to raise the wind. Can any one doubt that these
banks constitute the people, and that to separate
the Government from them would be to separate it
from the people1
The Lumberman's Banjr, in Pennsylvania,
which recently failed, is another proof that the
banks are the people. The board of directors
adopted a rule to make loans on real estate securi-
ties ; and in an exposition of the affairs of this
bank, it is stated that one individual, and I pre-
sume a director, " gave a mortgage, without a
bond, for $200,000, on about forty thousand acres
of land in Cattaraugus county, New York, and the
cashier afterwards gave up the notes on which this
indebtedness was founded, on receiving the debtor's
check for the amount " The mortgage was subse-
quently rescinded, and the notes returned.
The rule referred to was afterwards changed, so
as to authorize any agent of the bank to make
loans on the security of real estate, and one of the
directors executed a moitgage, without a bond, on
the undivided half of certain building lots, and, on
the strength of this security, he withdrew, with the
consent of the teller, a large amount of hisandi-
vidual and joint liabilities to the bank, in notes
and otherwise
In December last, the president and cashier of
the bank madeaieport to the Legislature, under
oath, that the bank had cash funds to the amount
of $270,000, which included the aforesaid mortgage
of $200,000, and on the failure of the bank, it is
fsund that it had specie in its vaults lo the enor-
mous amount of twenty-five dollars m silver, and one
hundred dollars in cents
The failure of this bank, which has contributed
its mite to the disorders of the currency, has no
doubt, in the opinion of our currency doctors, been
occasioned by the " experiments" of the late Ad-
mmistiation, in " tampering" with the currency
Mr. President, I am aware that these details are
tedious, yet I have a few more "crumbs of com-
fort" in relation to the banks oí the good old Com-
monwealth oí Massachusetts, a State justly distin-
guished for its wealth and the enterprise of us
cituens, and surely its banking system ought to be
sound to the core, as it has been entirely free from
the "tampering" measure:  of the late Administra-
tion, as the bank party have had the undisputed
direction of its councils, for a "time, whereof the
memory of man runneth not to the contrary " But,
strange as it may seem, the banks in this State are
in a very bad way, several of them have recently
gone the way of all the earth, and others appear to
be in a quick consumption, which threatens soon
to carry them off Of the former aie the Cheksea,
Lafayette, Commonwealth, Middlesex, and Frank-
lin Two of these, T believe, were deposite banks.
The bills of the Commonwealth Bank are said to be
at a discount of thirty per cent and some of the
others to be but little better than continental money
The cold winds blowing from the pine lands in
Mame, seems to have thrown these banks into the
quick consumption which carried them off very
iapidly, and some of them appear to have always
had very feeble and slender constituí ons, which
could not stand the rude shock oí the times The
following banks have been suspected of having-the
same fatal disease, the American, Kilby, ffiftcock,
