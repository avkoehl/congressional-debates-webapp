EXECUTIVE COMMUNICATIONS.
The VICE PRESIDENT laid before'the Sen-
ate a report of the Postmaster General, made in
compliance with a resolution of the Senate, direct-
ing him to report such changes in the laws regu-
lating postages and the Post Office Department as
in his opinion would make that a self-sustaining

ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY.
Mr. HALE. I move that when the Senate ad-
journs to-day, it be to meet on Monday next.
Mr. HAMLIN. I hope not.
Mi. CHANDLER. I call for the yeas and
nays.
Mr. HUNTER. I hope not. Is it in order to
otlor that motion without unanimous consent?
The VfCE PRESIDENT. The Chair sup-
poses it is analogous to a motion to adjourn.
Mr. HUNTER. I hope the Senate will not
pass it. This day, I presume, will be given to pri-
vate bills, and I want to ask the Senate to-mor-
row to take up the appropriation bill which has
bÂ°on reported. Unless we get on with the ap-
propi lation bills, we shall be too much hurried at
the clofe of the session.
Mr. IVERSON. Is the question on the motion
to adjourn until Monday debatable ?
Mr. HUNTER, it is a debatable question. A
motion to adjourn simply is not; but a motion to
adjourn over is debatable'.
Air. [VEIiSON. I only want to know whether
it is so, that I may debate it. With the Senator
from Virginia, I am opposed to the motion, and
desire to present some views to the Senate why
it ou^ht not to pass, but I did not know whether
it was debatable or not. I do not want to tres-
pass on the rules of the Senate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. It appears to the
Chair that the motion is debatable within certain
limits; but if the question is made, it appears to
him, on reflection, that it may not be at this time
m order. It is not like a motion to adjourn.
Mr. HUNTER. If I have a right to object, I
do object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair, as at
present advised, will sustain the objection.
-\Ir. HALE. What is the objection?
The VICE PRESIDENT. That it is not at
this time m otder.
Mr. HALE. Why not?
The VICE PRESIDENT. The rules require
the Chair, as soon as the Journal is r<nd, to call
for petitions, and then for reports of standing
committees.
Mr. HALE. The practice has been different
ever since I have been jn the S 'nate.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair under-
stands it has been ruled differently.
