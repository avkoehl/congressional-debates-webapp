Obeyed this order until within 200 yards of the enemy's position, where batteries were discovered in position to pour upon our lines direct, cross, and enfilade fires. Two lines of infantry behind stone walls and breastworks were supporting these batteries. The strength and position of the enemy's batteries and their supports induced me to halt and confer with General Doles, and, with him, to make representation of the character of the enemy's position, and ask further instructions. In answer, received an order to retire quietly to a deep road some 300 yards in rear, and be in readiness to attack at daylight; withdrew accordingly. July 3, remained in line all day, with severe and damaging skirmishing in front, exposed to the artillery of the enemy and our own short-range guns, by the careless use or imperfect ammunition of which I lost 7 men killed and wounded. Withdrew at night, and formed line of battle near Gettysburg, where we remained on July 4. Commenced retreat with the army on the night of the 4th instant. I desire to express my thanks to the gentlemen of my staff-Captain [Seaton] Gales, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant [Caleb] Richmond, aide-de-camp, and Lieutenant Morrison, volunteer aide-for gallant and efficient services. My casualties are as follows:
