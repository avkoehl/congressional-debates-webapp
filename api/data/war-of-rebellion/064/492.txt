liable, though the country is full of bushwhackers. Disarmed some of the citizens last night. I apprehend no danger at present. I would respectfully ask permission to come to Rolla thursday and return Saturday; I have some little business there to attend to, &amp;c.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

L. E. WHYBARK,

Captain, Commanding Department.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI,Springfield, Mo., June 21, 1864.

JOHN S. COLEMAN, Esq.,

Marshfield, Mo.:

SIR: Your favor of the 18th instant came duly to hand and contents are noted. I am gratified at the willingness you express to take the field whenever necessary for the defense of this section. The country will avail itself of your services, in common with those of all patriotic citizens, in case of an emergency. It is the understanding now that your section and the counties south of you are quite free from guerrilla forces, and it is hoped that this condition will remain. It is oftentimes the case that citizens do more to suppress guerrilla warfare while banded together at home that when in the service.

Hoping that all will do all in their power to suppress this unnatural style of warfare, and assuring you that the Government will continue to do all in this power to protect the loyal and true citizens, I remain, your respectfully,

JOHN B. SANBORN,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., June 21, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

When you have your provisional militia organized send them to me. I have command of Enrolled Missouri Militia. What is the reason I don't hear from you on the subject?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE MISSOURI,Saint Louis, Mo., June 21, 1864.

General FISK,

Saint Joseph, Mo.:

A rebel colonel, by name Caleb Perkins, was seen at the town of Middle Grove, in Monroe County, one day last week, in full rebel uniform. Can he not be arrested?
