It will be seen that the excess of years of service over the number of men furnished in the first sub-district is 100; in the second, 110, &amp;c. Total in the district, 1,200.

The quota of the district under the present call is 1,000; this multiplied by three gives 3,000 years of service; to this add the excess (1,200); then as the number enrolled in the district (20,000) is to this sum (4,200), so is the number enrolled in the sub-district to the number of years service required, increased by its excess, from which deduct the excess of years of service which the sub-district has furnished, and divide the remainder by three to find the quota of the sub-district.
