HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,May 21, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: The desertion of the North Carolina troops from this army is becoming so serous an evil that, unless it can be promptly arrested, I fear the troops from that State will become greatly reduced.

Brigadier-General Lane reports that on the night of the 19th instant 32 men from Company A, Thirty-seventh Regiment North Carolina Volunteers, deserted, taking with them their arms, equipments, ammunition, &amp;c. They had just been paid off. These men are from Ashe County, bordering upon Grayson County, Virginia.

Captain John C. Gorman, Company B, Second Regiment North Carolina troops, states that one of them, of his company, who deserted on the 10th of April last, has voluntarily returned. From him he learns that a great many of the deserters from his brigade cross that James River some 40 or 50 miles above Richmond, at Lumbertown, and the Roanoke at Horse Ford Mills, in Amelia County. If local troops in the neighborhood could guard these fords and others along the rivers, a great many of our deserters might be arrested.
