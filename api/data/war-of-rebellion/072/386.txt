Haldeman, Third Kentucky Volunteers, ordnance officer, all performed third duties well. Captain Cullen Bradley, Sixth Ohio Light Battery, was chief of artillery till the consolidation of the artillery into a corps organization. For the intelligent manner in which he performed his duties, I offer to him my thanks. Would that I could include in the foregoing list of my staff the one other, who commenced the campaign with us, but whom the inscrutable ways of Divine Providence early called away from us-the name of Major James B. Hampson, One hundred and twenty-fourth Ohio Volunteers. Preparatory to the attack which to be made on the 27th of May, it had been ordered that all the guns should be placed in position during the night of the 26th, and open on the enemy's works the next morning. One of my batteries was slow in opening, and I ordered Major Hampson to go to the battery and hasten the work of preparation. While so employed the fatal shot of the sharpshooter was sped on its murderous errand, and Major Hampson fell mortally wounded. He expired at 4 p. m. of that afternoon, happy in the consciousness of dying in his country's service. Young, ardent, intelligent, graceful, gentle, and gallant, he fell in the early bloom of his manhood a victim to an atrocious rebellion, a martyr to his devotion to his country.

During the campaign my division in the various conflicts captured 16 commissioned officers and 666 enlisted men, for whom receipts were obtained. Two million four hundred and twenty-eight thousand rounds of small-arms ammunition were expended during the campaign, Taking the mean strength of the division during the campaign, this number would give an average of 421 rounds per man.

A report of casualties, amounting to 2,792 officers and men killed, wounded, and missing, is herewith appended.

Including so long a period of active operations, which were spread over so broad a field, this report is necessarily quite protracted; but it could not be compressed into narrower limits without doing injustice to the division whose services it is designed to commemorate.

The reports of brigade and regimental commanders are herewith transmitted.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.

Lieutenant Colonel J. S. FULLERTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Fourth Army Corps.
