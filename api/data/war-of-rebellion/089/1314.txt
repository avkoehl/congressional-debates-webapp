WILMINGTON, December 26, 1864.

Major-General WHITING:

MY DEAR FRIEND: You have all my sympathy and gratitude for the noble defense you are making. Bragg left here this morning and said he would attack, so I pray God you may not be overwhelmed. Don't fail to telegraph to me for anything or on any matter in which I can serve you or yours. My whole heart is with you, and I would my body was also.

Sincerely, yours,

T. H. HOLMES.

Major PARKER:

I have not heard from Major-General Whiting since 10.15 o'clock last night. Have had rain storm, which made it impossible to move the four companies I was to send to Battery Buchanan. Steamer has gone for them now. It is yet raining and thick, although the wind has subsided. Railroad line not working.

I have just received by small boat, by hand of Major Saunders, a dispatch from General Whiting, dated 7.30 a. m. He still holds and says that if you want to save the place the enemy must be driven from his front. Weather still calm and very foggy.
