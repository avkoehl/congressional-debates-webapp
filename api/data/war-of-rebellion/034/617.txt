it will be necessary for me to withdraw the picket line to the forks of the road near University Place. Up to this time the enemy has not ascended the mountain on the Cowan road or the Brakefield road.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

I would respectfully suggest that infantry be left to block up some of the roads, as the cavalry can retire by one road and can block up the road behind them as they as they go down, if axes can be left by the infantry to accomplish the work. These precautions may prove unnecessary, but, if the enemy press us very warmly, may be of some advantage.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

JOS. WHEELER,

Major-General.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Near University Place, July 4, 1863.

The enemy have been temporarily checked. I think they will advance as soon as they get up re-enforcements. Scouts sent toward Pelham and Brakefield found no enemy advancing in that direction. We thus far have had but three regiments engaged; these belong to Colonel [T.] Harrison's brigade. I have set for Colonel [G. G.] Dibrell, commanding Forrest's brigade, but he has not yet come up. I have sent for General Wharton, who is about 1 mile in the rear, directing him to form his line at that point, to support us should us should we be driven back.

With great respect, your obedient servant,

JOS. WHEELER,

Major-General.

Lieutenant General LEONIDAS POLK.

P. S.-In the last skirmish the enemy were driven back a short distance, but I presume only to await re-enforcements. We will contest the ground as well as possible.
HEADQUARTERS WHEELER'S CAVALRY CORPS,Mountains, near Cowan, July 4, 1863-4 p. m.

GENERAL: I have just retired one brigade, leaving one brigade upon the mountain. Fighting this morning quite heavy for a short time, the enemy being repulsed; their loss considerable, including a colonel and lieutenant-colonel. They show no disposition to pursue any farther.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOS. WHEELER,

Major-General.

General [LEONIDAS] POLK.
