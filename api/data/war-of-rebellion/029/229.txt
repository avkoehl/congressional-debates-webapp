No. 7. Report of Capt. William M. Wiles, Forty-forth Indiana Infantry, provost-marshal-general, of prisoners captured.
HDQRS. DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND, OFFICE PROVOST-MARSHAL-GENERAL, Murfreesborough, Tenn., February 9, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor herewith to forward a complete report of Confederate prisoners captured by the army under your command at the late battle of Stone's River, showing the number of regiments and other organizations represented, the number of the same from each State, the number of officers and enlisted men captured from each regiment or organization, the entire number of officers and enlisted men captured, and to what arm of the service they belong. The total number of prisoners captured is shown to be 3,694.*

Taking into account the number and character of the organization, and using the lowest possible estimate of the strength of each, it can be shown, beyond controversy, that the enemy's force exceeded our own by at least one-third. Complete reports of the number captured by the enemy from our own forces have not yet been received. From the best information received up to the present time, the number will not exceed 2,800, and in all probability the estimate is too large.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,WM. M. WILES,

Captain and Provost-Marshal-General.

Major-General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Commanding Department of the Cumberland.

*An earlier report (January 12, 1863) from this officer gave 126 officers and 3,071 men captured; total, 3,197.
