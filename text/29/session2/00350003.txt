president's message.
The Journal having been read—
The following Message from the President of
the United States was received by the hands of-J.
Knox Walker, Esq., his Private Secietary:
Fellow-Citizens of the Senate
.and of the House of Representatives:
In resuming your labors in the service of the
people, il is a subject of congratulation that there
has beer, no period in our past history, when all
the elements of national piospenty have be^n so
fully developed. Sinee your lf«st session no afflict-
ing dispensation has visited our country; general
good health has prevailed; abundance iias crown-
: ed the Joil of the husbandman; and labor in all
its branches is receiving an ample rewaru, while
; education, science, and the arts, are rapidly en-
: largmg the means of social happiness. The pro-
gress of our country in her career or' greatness,
; not only in the vast extension of our tewitonal
i limits and the rapid increase of our population,
> but in resources and wealth, and in the happy
! condition of our people, is without example in the
i history of nations.
I As the wisdom, strength, and beneficence of our
; free institutions aie unfolded, every day adds fresh
i motives to contentment, and fresh incentives to
patriotism.
! Our devout and sincere acknowledgments are
due to the gracious Giver of all good, for the mmi-
; berless blessings which our beioved country en-
'j°ys-
It, is a source of high satisfaction to know that
i the relations of the United States with ail other
i nations, with a single exception, are of the most
am'Vable character. Rmcerely attached to the
. policy of peace, early adopted and steadily pur-
sued by this Government, I have anxiously de-
sired to cultivate and cherish friendship and com-
merce with evetv foreign Power. The spirit and
haoits of the American people are favorable to
, the maintenance of such international harmony.
, In adhering to this wise policy, a preliminary and
! paramount dutv obviously consists in the protec-
i tion of our national interests fiom enctoarhiiient
| or sacrifice, and our national honor from reproach,
j These must be maintained at any hazard. They
| admit of no compromise or neglect, and must be
grru'->nlously and r.nnsiant'v ^n-irdf-d. In their
vigilant vindication, collision and conflict with
foreign Powers may sometimes become nmuoid-
able. Such has been our scrupulous adherence to
the dictates of jum^e, m <*!! our foreign inter-
course, that, though steathly and rai Hhv advan-
cing in prosperity and power, v/e have °!',en no
just cnuse of complaint to any nation, :md have
enjoyed the bles>>i"as of nc.H'cfor mo.e liun ihirtv
yeais. From e. pohcy so s^^i^d to h'-nniuuiv, and
so salutary in its effects unon our j-oliti'-ai *y&trm,
we should never be induccd voluntarily to depart.
The existing war wirh Mex fo was nt itlif-r de-
sij'ed nor provoked by the t/mted States. Om the
contr.iry, all honoiabic means were re^i-r'eu to to
avert it. After years of endurance of ;i':i;rMV'hted
and unrC'lressed wrongs on our pnr«, M  xi'*o, in
viol'dtiOsi of solemn treaty stipu' tnans, and of
everv principle of justice reco^msid by ciwhzed
nations, mmmenced Jiosuhties; and thus, ! y her
own af'i, forced the war un^n us. Eontr before
the advance of our army to the loft ha; ic of the
R:o Grande, we had ample cause of wi " a_;amst
Mexico: and had the United States resorted to this
extremity, we might have nppcuh^u to the whole
civilirpil v/orld for the justice of our cause.
I deem it to he my duty to p r*sent to you, on
the present occasion, a condensed review of (he
injuries we had sustained, of the causes whi< h ied
to the war, and of its prn^re^s since its commence-
ment. This is rendered the more necessary, be-
cause of the misanpiehensions which have to some
extent pievaiied as to its origin and true character.
