COMMANDING OFFICERS,

Be on the lookout for cavalry that will attempt to burn the bridges. Intrench well close to the bridges and guard them with incessant care and watchfulness. I have intercepted orders to Jackson's cavalry that satisfy me the attempt will be made. An additional regiment should watch the Etowah bridge.

GENERAL THOMAS' HEADQUARTERS,

Big Shanty, June 14, 1864 - 9 p. m.

Majors ECKERT and BECKWITH:

Weather cleared up, cool winds drying roads fast. Some advance to-day, and Thomas has gained ground and has one rebel brigade nearly surrounded. Our signal officers read the enemy's flags, and in this way we learn that the rebel general Polk was killed to-day and his remains sent to Marietta. The messages were from Hood. The fact is carefully concealed that we can do so, lest becoming known the rebel signal officers change code. Three officers and twenty-seven men came into Logan's lines to-day. They state that Johnston has not the confidence of his army and that desertions would be very frequent if officers left certain of amnesty. They were Alabamians.

J. C. VAN DUZER,

Captain and Assistant Quartermaster.
