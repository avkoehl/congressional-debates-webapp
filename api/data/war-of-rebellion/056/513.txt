COLLIERVILLE, December 27, 1863.

HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 27, 1863.

Lieutenant W. S. BELDEN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Collierville, Tennessee:

If it is possible send a message by Moscow to General Grierson. I have no doubt you will hold your fort, for it must be too dark for an attack to-night. Canister will be the thing to repel an assault. Give it freely when in range. If they try artillery on you in the morning use the Parrotts, and be sure to fire low enough. One shell delivered under their gun will cripple it. Do not waste any fire.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTEENTH ARMY CORPS,Memphis, Tennessee, December 27, 1863.

Lieutenant W. S. BELDEN,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General, Collierville, Tennessee:

Hang upon the party that has crossed. Delay them as much as possible. Pick up prisoners and follow their track, notifying General Grierson at La Grange. One regiment of cavalry is now on the way from La Grange, and the whole command should be a Moscow by night.

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.

Major-General HURLBUT:

Our whole force is about 400 men, with two 10-pounder Parrotts and two 12-pounder howitzers. Strength of enemy 1,000 from best information.
