HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SAVANNAH,Savannah, Ga., May 7, 1865.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL, Department of the South:

General Molineux's brigade is here. If it meets the approval of the major-general commanding I will at once put in en route by land for Augusta and order back, upon its arrival, General Washburn's brigade, provided at that time it is thought perfectly safe to do so. General Molineux's brigade numbers in aggregate present about 1,600.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

General Schofield is of opinion that a military governor of North Carolina should be appointed so as to immediately organize a provisional system of local civil administration. If the Government approves this course I respectfully request that Generael Schofield be appointed military governor. We are in immediate communication by telegraph and can consult together freely.

Am just arrived. All well with Schofield. Expect to reach City Point to-morrow and receive my orders from you. Did you get my dispatch from Morehead City? Am informed that General Slocum will march from Richmond on the 10th. I expect to join and march with the Right Wing, with which my horses are.

(Received 10 a. m. 9th.)

Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT, Washington;

I have full dispatches from Wilson of the 6th. One boat has arrived at Augusta all right. He is after Jeff. Davis, who cannot escape save in disguise. He is reported in Georgia, escorted by about seventy officers as a special body guard and about 3,000 cavalry . Does the Secretary of War's newspaper order take Wilson from my command or shall I continue to order him? If I have proven incompetent to manage my own command let me know it.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
