MAY 6, 1864.

Colonel LOCKE:

SIR: General Meade, on my arrival, ordered me to report to General Hancock; subsequently to hold the woods in front, and to report to General Warren. General Burnside is moving in column toward Hancock. I have part of all the brigades in the four divisions - all I can hear of. I will await the orders of General Warren. I am fearful that General Wadsworth is dead.

L. CUTLER,

Brigadier-General.
