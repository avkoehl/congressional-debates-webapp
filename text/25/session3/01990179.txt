whereas, alio, " freedom of election is essential to the mu-
tual independence of the State and Federal Governments,
and of the different branches of the same Government so
vitalty cherished by Americin institutions " Therefore,
Revolve I, That in the opinion of the Senate, it is highly
" improper for officers, depending on the Executive of the
Union, to attempt to control or influence the free exercise
of the elective right "
Resolved also, That measures ought to be adopted by
Congress, =o fir as their donstmitiotnl powers nny extend,
to restrain, by law, all interference of Federal officers with
elections, otlieru i&e than by gmng their own votes, and
that the report ot the Judiciary Committee be committed
to a select committee with instructions to new model it
according to the principles declared in the foregoing pre
amble and resolutions
The Senate then adjourned
