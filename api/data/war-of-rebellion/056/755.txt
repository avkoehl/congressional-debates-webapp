HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, FOURTH DIVISION, Two Miles West of Tunnel Hill, Nov.28, 1863-2 p.m.

Major-General WHEELER,Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: The Yankee column having destroyed the bridge referred to in my last, are now slowly retiring, followed by my skirmishers, and Major Chenoweth reports numerous fires on the line of railroad to their rear. This would seem to indicate a retrograde movement. I ordered them to be followed up closely, and if I had the force would press them vigorously to develop more quickly their real intention.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. WARREN GRIGSBY,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND BRIGADE, FOURTH DIVISION, Two Miles West of Tunnel Hill, Nov.28, 1863-11 p.m.

Major-General WHEELER,Chief of Cavalry:

GENERAL: I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your dispatch of 9.45 p.m. As I have already reported, the enemy occupy the narrow valley on this side of the gap, with their pickets advanced to the stone church. Their flanks can, therefore, be passed only by scaling the ridges, which is manifestly impracticable in the obscurity of night, but I will start the most reliable scouting officer I have at daylight to gather all the information he can.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

J. WARREN GRIGSBY,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE, Dalton, Ga., November 28, 1863-12.30 p.m.

Major-General WHEELER,Commanding Cavalry Corps:

GENERAL: Unless compelled to fall back, the general wishes you to hold your present position or its immediate vicinity. The line of cavalry should be kept well to the front, and extend to the right and left so as to cover the approaches to both flanks.

Communicate promptly to these headquarters any change in the dispositions of your forces or in the movements of the enemy. Make known your wants freely in all respects so they can be supplied.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

KINLOCH FALCONER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
