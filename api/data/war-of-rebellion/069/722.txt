Please order Captain McAlester here if he can be spared from West Point; also order the saw-mill at Fort Monroe to saw all the 2-inch lumber they can, and place it on board barges, subject to my order. The Coehorn mortars on transports leave where they are.

We will not want them now.

Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War:

Please say to General Meade that the lying report alluded to in your telegram* was not even for a moment believed by the President or myself. We have the most perfect confidence in him. He could not wish a more exalted estimation of his ability, his firmness, and every quality of a commanding general than is entertained for him.
