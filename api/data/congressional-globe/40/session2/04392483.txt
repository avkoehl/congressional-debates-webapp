1868.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
than one and a half millions—a decrease of
more than fifty per cent.; and prices of labor and
materia.} are still too high to enable oar ship-
wrights to compete with foreign builders.
From the facts already exhibited in reference
to our industrial revolution, and from the fore-
going analysis of the nature and functions of
currency, it is manifest:
1. That the remarkable prosperity of all indus-
trial enterprise during the war was not caused
by the abundance of currency, but by the unpar-
alleled demand for every product of labor.
2. That the great depression of business,
the stagnation of trade, the "hard times"
which have prevailed during the past year, and
which still prevail, have not been caused by
an insufficient amount of currency, but mainly
by the great falling off of the demand for all the
products of labor compared with the increased
supply since the return from war to peace.
HOW MUCH CURRENCY IS NEEDED?
I should be satisfied to rest on these prop-
ositions without further argument, were it not
that the declaration is so often and so confi-
dently made by members of this House, that
there is not only no excess of currency, but
that there is not enough for the business of the
country. I subjoin a table, carefully made up
from the official records, showing the amount
of paper money in the United States at the
beginning of each year from 1834 to 1868, inclu-
sive. The fractions of millions are omitted:

To obtain a full exhibit) of the circulating
medium of the country for these years, it would
be necessary to add to the above, the amount
of coin in circulation each year. This amount
cannot be ascertained with accuracy, but it is
the opinion of those best qualified to judge,
that there were about two hundred million dol-
lars of gold and silver coin in the United States
at the beginning of the rebellion. It is offi-
cially known that the amount held by the
banks from 1860 to 1863 inclusive, averaged
about ninety-seven million dollars. Including
bank reserves, the total circulation of coin and
paper never exceeded §400,000,000 before the
war. Excludingthe bank reserves the amount
was never much above $300,000,000. During
the twenty-six years preceding the war the
average bank circulation was less than one
hundred and thirty-nine million dollars.
It is estimated that the amount of coin now
in the United States is not less than $250,000,-
000. When it is remembered that there are
now $106,000,000 of coin in the Treasury, that
customs duties and interest on the public debt
are paid in coin alone, and that the currency of
the States and Territories of the Pacificcoastis
wholly metallic, it will be seen that a large sum
of gold and silver must be added to the volume
of paper currency in order to ascertain the
whole amount of our circulation. It cannot be
successfully controverted that the gold, silver,
and paper, used as money in this country at
this time, amount to $1,000,000,000. If we
subtract from this amount our bank reserves—
which amounted on the 1st of January last to
$162,500,000, and also the cash in the national
Treasury, which at that time amounted to
$134,000,000—we still have left in active cir-
culation, more than seven hundred million
dollars.
It rests with those who assert that our pres-
ent amount of currency is insufficient, to show
that one hundred and fifty per cent, more cur-
rency is now needed for the business of the
country than was needed in 1860. To escape
this difficulty, it has been asserted, by some
honorable members, that the country never had
currency enough ; and that credit was substi-
tuted before the war to supply the lack of
money. It is a perfect answer to this, that in
many of the States a system of free banking
prevailed; and such banks pushed into circu-
lation all the money they could find a market
for.
RELATION OF CURRENCY TO FINANCIAL PANICS.
The table I have submitted shows how per-
fect an index the currency is, of the healthy or
unhealthy condition of business, and that every
great financial crisis, during the period covered
by the table, has been preceded by a great in-
crease, and followed by a great and sudden
decrease in the volume of paper money. The
rise and fall of mercury in the barometer is not
more surely indicative of an atmospheric storm,
than is a sudden increase or decrease of cur-
rency indicative of financial disaster. Within
the period covered by the table there were four
great financial and commercial crises in this
country. They occurred in 1837, 1841, 1854,
and 1857. Now, observe the change in the
volume of paper crrency for those years.
Onthelstday of January, 1837, the amount
had risen to $149,000,000, an increase of
nearly fifty per cent, in three years. Before the
end of that year, the reckless expansion, spec-
ulation, and overtrading which caused the in-
crease, had resulted in terrible collapse ; and
on the 1st of January, 1838, the volume was
reduced to $116,000,000. Wild lands, which
speculation had raised to fifteen and twenty
dollars per acre, fell to one dollar and a half
and two dollars, accompanied by a correspond-
ing depression in all branches of business. Im-
mediately after the crisis of 1841 the bank cir-
culation decreased twenty-five percent., and by
the end of 1842 was reduced to $58,500,000, a
decrease of nearly fifty per cent.
At the beginning of 1853 the amount was
$146,000,000. Speculation and expansion had
swelled it to $205,000,000 by the end of that
year, and thus introduced the crash of 1854.
At the beginning of 1857 the paper money of
the country reached its highest point of infla-
tion up to that time. There were nearly two
hundred and fifteen millions, but at the end of
that disastrous year the volume had fallen to
$135,000,000, a decrease of nearly forty per
cent, in less than twelve months. In the great
crashes preceding 1837 the same conditions are
invariably seen—great expansion, followed by
a violent collapse, not only in paper money,
but in loans and discounts ; and those mani-
festations have always been accompanied by a
corresponding fluctuation in prices.
In the great crash of 1819, one of the severest
this country every suffered, there was a com-
plete prostration of business. It is recorded
in Niles's Register for 1820 that in that year an
Ohio miller sold four barrels of flour to raise
five dollars, the amount of his subscription to
that paper. Wheat was twenty cents per bushel
and'corn ten cents. About the same time Mr.
Jefferson wrote to Nathaniel Macon :
"Wo have now no standard of value. I am asked
eighteen dollars for a yard of broadcloth which,
when we had dollars, I used to get for eighteen shil-
lings."
DOES THE HIGH II VTJ3 OP INTEREST INDICATE AN INSUF-
FICIENT AMOUNT OF CURRENCY?
But the advocates of paper-money expan-
sion answer us:
"It makes no difference what your reasoning may
be, wo allege the fact that there is great stringency
in our money market, great depression in business,
and the high rate of interest everywhere demanded,
especially m the West, proves conclusively that an
increase of currency is needed."
The relation of-business to the supply of
money and to the rate of interest, has never
been so strikingly illustrated as in the financial
and business history of Europe during the past
two years. At the beginning of 1866 there was
great activity and apparent prosperity in the
business of Europe. It was a period of spec-
ulation and overtrading. About the middle
of that year the depression commenced, which
has continued and increased till now, when
the distress is greater and more widespread
than it has been for a quarter of a century.
From May, 1866, to the present time, the rate
of interest in the principal money centers of
Europe has been steadily decreasing. The
following table, collated from the London
Economist, exhibits the fact that the average
decline in nine kingdoms of Europe is fifty
per cent.:

It will be noticed that the rate is lowest in
specie-paying countries, and highest where
there is a large volume of depreciated paper
money, as in Russia, Spain, and Italy. But the
important fact exhibited in this table is, that as
commercial distress has increased, the rate of
interest has decreased, and that the hard time3
have been accompanied with an abundant sup-
ply of money.
It would be as reasonable for an English-
man to assert that the distress and stagna-
tion of business there has been caused by the
plethora of money and the low rate of interest,
as for us to claim that our distress is caused by
an insufficient currency and a high rate of
interest. There, as here, the distress was caused
by overproduction and overtrading.
England thought to grow rich out of our
misfortunes, and, in her greed, overreached
herself and brought misery and ruin upon mil-
lions of her people. As a specimen of her
crazy expansion of business, witness the fact
that in the years 1863, 1804, and 1865, in ad-
dition to all other enterprises, there were organ-
ized eight hundred and thirty-two joint-stock
companies, witlian authorized capital of £363,-
000,000 sterling. During 1866 and 1867, there
were organized but seventy-one such compa-
nies, with an authorized capital of less than
sixteen million five hundred thousaud pounds
sterling.
The Bankers' Magazine of London, for May,
1867, says that—
"In the vaults of the Bank of England, the Bank
of Fra nco, and in Amsterdam, Frankfort, Hamburg,
and Berlin, there are £75,000,000; the rate of discount
averages three per cent., and tending downward; yet
in cach and every one of these cities complaints of
the scarcity of money were never more rife."
At the end of 1807, the same magazine, of a
later date, says there were <£23,500,000 sterling
gold in the Bank of England, besides£ll,000,-
000 of coin and paper reserves, but " not the
slightest life in trade."
The London Times of December 20, 1867,.
says :
" We are now paying the penalty of wild specula-
tion and overtrading. For eighteen months, all but
the ordinary business of the country is at a stand-
still." "Millions on millions
arc lying useless in the various banks of the country
because the owners of the money cannot yot prevail
upon themselves to trust it in any of the ordinary in-
vestments."
From these facts it is evident that those who
attribute our hard times to a reduction of the
currency will find themselves unable to explain
the hard times in Europe.
We are constantly reminded that the coun-
try was prosperous at the beginning of 1866,
before the currency was reduced, but is now
in distress since the reduction, and these two
facts are assumed to sustain the relation to
each other of cause and effect,,
Now, let it be observed that since January,
1866, the volume of paper currency has been
reduced sixteen and a half per cent., but during
the same time there has been an average decline
in prices of not less than twenty per cent. ; that
is, eighty cents in currency will purchase as many
commodities now as a dotlar would two years
ago; and there are-eighty-three and a half
