THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 21,
found to be about $800 to each person in
Hie Slate of Alabama, against §221 to each
person in the State of Illinois.
Mr. KELLEY. Will the gentleman allow
me to put a brief question to him right here?
Mr. HITTER. A short one.
Mr. KELLEY. Does that calculation em-
brace the appraised value of the slaves in
Alaiaama and Kentucky?
Mr. HITTER. Yes, sir; I believe the Gov-
ernment always went upon the principle that
they were worth something.
Mr. KELLEY. Does the calculation also
embrace the appraised value of the laboring
people of the free States?
Sir. HITTER. That has nothing to do with
it, because the free colored people in the slave
States are upon just the same footing in that
respect with the free laboring population of the
North.
The people of the State of Illinois made, ia
1860, the following products :
Wheat, 24,159,500 bu., at SI $ bu S2t.159.M0

cattle, sheep, and swine  73,434,621
Total value $164,593,771
This gives an average to each person in the
State of Illinois of about $90.
I would like to have the attention of the
gentleman from Pennsylvania [Mr. ICelleyj
to this, because I suppose he will attempt to
disprove these calculations, if he can.
Mr. KELLEY. I think they are disproved
now.
Mr. HITTER. I have no doubt they are as
much as they ever will be.
The people of the State of Alabama made,
in 1800, the following products :

of these will be found to be about $1,0*24,
against $631 in the State of Massachusetts.
In Massachusetts in 1860:

Total   $73,504,010
This gives an average to each person in the
State of Alabama, including slaves, of about
S14C; and if the average is made between
the white and free colored persons only it is
about S2GG. against an average of $9G in the
State of Illinois.
These facts, it seems to me. are sufficient to
satisfy the most prejudiced partisan as to which
is the most profitable; free or slave labor: but
as «omo persons are never satisfied unless ex-
tremes are made to meet, I beg to ask attention
to a few facts in relation to the States of Mas-
sachusetts and South Carolina.
Massachusetts had a population in 1860 of—
White persons 1,221,164
Free coloied persons  9,092
Total 1,231,006
The assessed value of real estate and per-
sonal property in Massachusetts in was
8777,1-37,810, making an average to each per-
son in the State of about $G31.
South Carolina had a population in 1800 of—
White persons 2s)l,388
Flee colored      y!93 4
Slaves  ! 1.402,406
Total  703,708
The assessed value of real estate and per-
sonal property in South Carolina was in 1800
which makes an average to each
pei-Min in the State, including slaves, of S*J95 ;
and if the average is made between the white
and free colored persons, who were the owners
of the property, the average value to each one
This gives an average to each person in the
State of South Carolina, including slaves, of
about one hundred and four dollars; and if
the average is made between the white and
free colored persons only, it will be to each
about two hundred and forty-three dollars. 1
against about thirteen dollars to each person !
in the State of Massachusetts. |
It may be said that Massachusetts is not ;
an agricultural State, and that her wealth and '
profits arise from her manufactories. This does j
not alter the case, as her property is certainly I
all included in her list of propeity assessed for j
taxation, and the same difference exists there, j
But we are told that the negro will work ,
better and produce more as a fieeman than they <
have ever done as slaves. To ascertain what I
is true, or what we may expect from the col- 1
ored people that have been lately made free,
we have only to ascertain what has been the
result where any large numbers of that race
have been suddenly emancipated : and in order
; that there shall be no cause for contradiction
i on this point as to the facts of the ease I will
• give them in the language of that eminent his-
: torian, Alison, who. in his History of Europe,
j says that—
j "St. Domingo, the greatest except Cuba, and be-
| yoiid all question the most flourishing of the West 1
1 India islands before the Revolution, is about three .
j hundred railesin length and its average breadth about
ninety miles. The Spanish possessed two thirds and
: the French the remainder. In the French portion the
! inhabitants consisted of about forty thousand whites,
I sixty thousand mulattoes, and live hundred thousand
t negro slaves. This French colony was immensely pro-
| ductive, exceeding all the British islands together.
( Its exports, including the Spanish portion, were
I £18,4OO,C00, and its impoits £!0,0u0,0u0 sterling. Eigh-
1 teen hundred vessels and twenty-seven thousand
1 sailors were employed in conductingthevast colonial
! traffic. It was this splendid and unequaled colonial
: possession which the French nation threw away and
• destroyed at the commencement of the Revolution,
, with a recklessness and improvidence of which the
previous history of the world had afforded no exam-
1 pie. Hardly had the cry of liberty and equality been
: raised in France, says our historian, when it responded
i warmly and vehemently from the shore?* of St. JDo-
r mingo. The slave population were rapidly assailed
i bvi evolutionary agents and emissaries, and the work-
j! shops and fields of the planters overrun by heated
mi;— ionaries,who poured into an ignorant and ardent
:• multitude the new-born ideas of European freedom.
<[ "The Constituent Assembly of .Maieh 8,1790, had
:, empowered the colonies to make known their wishes
: on the subject ot a constitution by Colonial Assem-
' blics fiecLv elected by their own citizens, and on the
15th of May, 1701, riie privilege-: of equaltfy were
• conferred by the same authority on ail persons of
. color born of u free father and mother. Tno plant-
■ er^ openly endeavored to resist the decree, and civil
■ war w.i^i preparing, when, on the night of the 2Gfh
; of Augu-r, 1701. the negro insurrection long and
j silently organized, at once broke forth and wrapped
] the whole northern part of the colony in flames.
j "The conspiracy embraced nearly the wholcncgro
j population of the island. The cruelties excrcked
' exceeded anything recorded in histoiy. The negroes
! marched with spiked infants on their spears instead
| of colors. They sawed asunder their male prisoners
i and violated the females on the dead bodies of their
j husbands."
! Here, sir. we have tlig result of an attempt
! to put the negro on an equality with the white
1 man. Sir, does it afford any consolation to
those who are so persistently endeavoring to
bring on an equality here? Want is there* in this
plain and clear historic fact that given hope for
a better result here if these wild and fanatical
schemes are pressed upon the people of these
United States? *Do we not know, sir, that his-
tory will repeat itself, and that if they continue
to press and force upon the people this'equal-
ity that similar results will be the consequence
here?
But, sir, let us follow our author a little
further, and see what has been the result of
the emancipation of these people upon the
industry and prosperity of the island. He
informs us that the universal freedom of the
blacks was proclaimed on the 3d of June, 1703,
and then gives us the following table, which he
says contains the comparative wealth, produce,
and trade of St. Domingo 1781* and in 1832,
after forty years of nominal freedom:
1789.
Population  000,000
Susar exported, pounds 672,000,000
Coffee, pounds 8(5,7S9.000
Ships employed    1,630
Sailors  27,000
Exports to Franco £6,720,000
Imports from France   £9,890,000
1832.
Population  2S0.000
Sugar  none
Coffee, pounds  32,000,000
Ships employed  1
Sailors  167
Exports to France  none
Imports  none
Here sir, we have a very sad but very in-
structive account of the result of suddenly
emancipating large numbers of the colored race.
Sir, is history to repeat itself in this instance?
Is it not most rational for us to suppose that it
will ? What reason have we to believe that the
colored people will do any better here than
they have done under similar circumstances in
other countries? Sir, can any gentleman sup-
pose after being informed of these plain histor-
ical facts that those large and rich plantations
in the former slave States will ever (for genera-
tions to come) be made to wave and almost
to groan with or on account of the rich harvests
of former years? Ko sir. But on the contrary
these broad and fertile acres will be unculti-
vated. the fences that once inclosed them rotted
and gone, and the land which once sent forth
such large and heavy crops of grain, tobacco,
and cotton will be covered with brambles and
other wild growth that will afford no profit to
either man or beast.
But, sir, we have other evidence to prove that
whenever large numbers of colored people are
suddenly emancipated the result is the destruc-
tion of labor, and consequently a very large
falling off of the products of the soil.
I will call the attention of gentlemen to the
facts as they have occurred in the island of
Jamaica, where the negroes were emancipated
under the most favorable circumstances: their
freedom was not said to be the result of war.
No, sir; the Parliament of Great Britain hon-
estly made an appropriation to pay the owners
for their property, and full equality, as it is
desired here, was granted to the negro race.
Parliament passed the act liberating the slaves
on this island in 1833. Their population at
that time was, of whites. 1 o,77<> 5 mulattoes,
08.527; and of blacks, 2if3, 125. In the year
1810 Jamaica imported to the amount of
£4,3^08.337, and her exports were £3,303.579.
In twenty years after the emancipation of the
slaves her imports had fallen off to the sum
of £804,00-4 and her exports to the sum of
£837,270; and in 180-4 her exports were only
£403,520, and her imports £1)32,310. Thero
has been some increase in her black and mu-
latto population ; but the white population have
decreased to the amount of 1,1)00, and during
the period between 1832 and 1847, G05. Sugar
and coffee plantations containing350,402 acres
of land were entirely abandoned; and from
1818 to 1-^53 T>73 other plantations, containing
301.1*7 acres, were totally or partially turned
to waste. These facts were recently stated in
a ppccch delivered in the other end^ of this
Capitol by one of the Senators from Kentucky
