JUNE 27, 1863.

SIR: AT 3 O'CLOCK YESTERDAY AFTERNOON I RECEIVED AN ORDER TO DETAIL A SQUADRON OF THIS COMMAND TO PROCEED TO CENTREVILLE WITHOUT DELAY, THERE TO ASCERTAIN THE POSITION OF AFFAIRS, &amp;C. I BEG LEAVE RESPECTFULLY TO REPORT, IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOREGOING ORDER, THAT I DETAILED MAJOR REMINGTON, WITH COMPANIES B AND C, OF THIS REGIMENT, TO EXECUTE THE FOREGOING ORDER; THAT ABOUT 4. 30 O'CLOCK MAJOR REMINGTON LEFT THIS CAMP, PROCEEDING IN THE DIRECTION INDICATED BY HIS ORDERS. ABOUT 8. 30 A. M. OF THIS DAY, MAJOR REMINGTON, HAVING PROCEEDED AS FAR AS FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, ENCOUNTERED THE PICKETS OF THE SIXTH VIRGINIA CAVALRY. MAJOR REMINGTON CHARGED UPON THE ENEMY WITH DRAWN SABERS, AND SUCCEEDED IN CAPTURING ABOUT ONE-HALF OF THE ENEMY. BEFORE, HOWEVER, HE COULD SUCCEED IN RALLYING HIS SMALL FORCE, THE REBELS RECOVERED THEIR PRESENCE OF MIND, AND COMPANIES B AND C WERE FORCED TO CUT THEIR WAY THROUGH, ABANDONING PRISONERS AND ALL. MAJOR REMINGTON'S HORSE WAS SHOT IN THE BREAST IN TWO PLACES, AND AT LEAST ONE-THIRD OF HIS COMMAND IS KILLED, WOUNDED, OR MISSING. THE LAST SEEN OF LIEUTENANT DAGWELL, OF COMPANY C, HE WAS CHARGING THE REBELS WITH THE SECOND PLATOON, COMPOSED OF COMPANY C; HE HAD ABOUT A DOYEN MEN WITH HIM. CAPTAIN CAMPBELL, OF COMPANY B, WAS LAST SEEN WHEN CHARGING THE REBELS; HE HAD SHOT AND KILLED 1 REBEL OFFICER. LIEUTENANT HAZELTON, OF COMPANY B, WAS TWICE FIRED AT AND MISSED; HE WAS LEADING HIS DETACHMENT WHEN LAST SEEN. SERGEANT MORRIS, OF COMPANY B, WAS NOT WOUNDED, ALTHOUGH HE SHOT THE OFFICER WHO ASSAULTED MAJOR REMINGTON. SERGEANT BEEBE IS KNOWN TO BE WOUNDED IN THE ANKLE, AND IS PROBABLY A PRISONER. MAJOR REMINGTON RETURNED TO CAMP WITH 18 MEN; HE TOOK WITH HIM ABOUT 100 MEN. HE WENT OUT SUPPOSING THAT HE WAS TO GO AND RECOVER AND RETURN GOVERNMENT PROPERTY, IN CHARGE OF A GUARD. HE
