Mr. SUMNER. The Senator from Ohio has |
kindly explained to us one leading feature of the j
bill; but theie is another section which, it seems
to rac, is as important as any one—section three ;
—which is as follows:
That each Senator, n<'pte^ntaiive, and Deleft'1 shall be '
ai.ntianv allow <•<! ami p.iid ibt postage and stationery tne
sum ol $L(i0; and no allowance for newspapejs or other ;
incidental expenses shall be made. !
Now, I have no ci itiei^m to make upon the hm- .
itation on the stationary allowed to Senators', nor
on the limitation upon newspapers; but the point
to which I wish to'caU the attention of the Sen-
ator is, what is the effect of the allusion to post- i
age there? Is it intended in this indirect way to I
abolish the frankim? privilege? 1
Mr. SHERMAN" 1 ":m state that that subject
£89.580
was discussed in committee, and that was not the
intention, and it was not expected that this alone
would produce that result; but this provision was
inserted in the expectation that by another law
the franking: privilege would be abolished; and we
have provided here a substitute for the franking
privilege in case it shall be abolished. If, how-
ever, in the course of legislation, the franking priv-
ilege shall not bo abolished, as a mutter of course,
this provision might properly be changed. This
provision alone will not abolish the franking priv-
ilege; it simply provides a substitute in case the
franking privilege shall be abolished.
Mr. SUMNER. Then I suggest to the Sen-
ator whether it be advisable to introduce that lan-
guage into the statute until the franking privilege
has been abolished.
Mr. SHERMAN. In regard to that, I wish
to say that the present allowance to members of
stationery, newspapers, and the like, amounts
to over one hundred dollars. It is better to fix
it, and fix the amount allowed for all contin-
gent expenses, at some specified sum. One hun-
dred dollars we thought sufficient to cover every-
thing.
Mr. SUMNER. I make the suggestion to the
Senator, would it not be better to leave out what
is said about postage, so that it will read, " that
each Senator, Representative, and Delegate shall
be annually allowed and paid for stationery" a
certain sum.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will insert after " post-
age'' the words, "in case the franking privilege
is abolished."
Mr. CLARK. I think it is better to leave it
out entirely.
Mr. COWAN. With all deference to the hon-
orable Senator from Ohio, that would be a very
clumsy way of passing a law, to make it depend-
ent on the contingency of another law being sub-
sequently passed. I think the amendment pro-
posed by the Senator from Massachusetts a better
one.
Mr. SUMNER. I think the word " postage"
had better go out, and we can deal with that mat-
ter specifically by itself when it comes up.
Mr. SHERMAN. I am perfectly willing to
strike out the word " postage."
The VICE PRESIDENT. Is the motion to
strike out the whole section?
Mr. SHERMAN. No, to strike out the words
(< postage and."
Mr. SUMNER. My amendment is to strike
out " postage and."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. TEN EYCK. I desire to propose asmall
amendment, to which I will call the attention of
the Senators who reported this bill. It is a slight
modification; on the third page, section five, in
lines nine and ten, I propose to strike out the
word " document" before " room," in each of
these lines, and insert the word " folding"in their
place. I do this because the object is to abolish
one of two offices; and I am informed that the
business of the folding-room is infinitely more
extensive than thebusiness of the document-room.
It does not make any change in the bill, but re-
tains the office of superintendent of the folding-
room instead of superintendent of the document-
room. I hope'there will be no objection to that.
Mr. SHERMAN. I will simply state that,
under the present law, there are two officers, one
superintendent of folding-room, and one superin-
tendent of document-room. One of them can cer-
tainly be dispensed with; I do not care which. If
the Senate prefers to dispense with the superin-
tendent of the document-room, I have no objec-
tion. One, I think, can be dispensed with.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I think it must be very
clear to Senators who have been here any lengtfi
of time, that the office of superintendent of the doc-
ument-room cannot be dispensed with; for when
we want documents we rely—I do, and I presume
every other Senator docs—on an experienced man
who knows where all the documents are, and can
find them to our hand.
If it is necessary to dispense with the superin-
tendent ofthe folding-room, be it so. If we pa^-s the
bill abolishing the franking privilege, it certainly
will be very easy to dispense with him, because he
will have nothing to do; we shall then publish no
more books, and there will be nothing for the fold-
ers to do except to attend to the slight folding of
the ordinary pi inting here, and what we may indi-
vidually want done in the way ©f folding speeches,
whichn-eally has nothing to do with the public ser-
vice. If that bill is to be passed, it is perfectly
evident that this bill must be postponed before final
action on it until that is disposed of, because there
are several clauses in this bill that depend upon
the passage of the bill abolishing the franking
privilege. I have no objection to going through
the various sections of the bill and making slight
amendments, but I think final action cannot possi-
bly be had at the piesent time. For instance, ifwe
do not abolish the franking privilege, and we con-
tinue to publish documents, as we have heretofore,
in large number^, we must have a superintendent
of the folding-room, though we may not, perhaps,
need so many folders as we have had heretofore.
I should doubt the expediency in that case of abol-
