MAY 5, 1864-7 p.m.

Lieutenant-General EWELL,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: The commanding general directs me to repeat a message sent you at 6 p.m. The enemy persist in their attack on General Hill's right. Several efforts have been repulsed, and we hold our own as yet. The general wishes you to hurry up Ramseur, send back and care for your wounded, fill up your ammunition, and be ready to act by light in the morning. General Longstreet and General Anderson are expected up early, and unless you see some means of operating against their right, the general wishes you to be ready to support our right. It is reported that the enemy is massing against General Hill, and if an opportunity presents itself and you can get Wilderness Tavern ridge and cut the enemy off from the river, the general wishes it done. The attack on General Hill is still raging. Be ready to act as early as possible in the morning.

Yours, most respectfully,

C. MARSHALL,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
HEADQUARTERS, May 5, 1864-6 p.m.

Major-General STUART:

Send the two regiments to their brigades. General Hill will have some one to meet and direct them.

Respectfully,W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

The regiments must keep down the plank road to their division.

MILFORD, May 5, 1864.

General R. E. LEE:

Receiving no orders from General Stuart, I fear he is absent. One North Carolina regiment here, one on picket, one marching from Richmond. If Gordon leaves now I shall have only 200 men. I ask for instructions.

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.

MILFORD, May 5, 1864.

General STUART:

Good scouts report Burnside passed Bealeton on 3rd. Nothing but negroes guarding railroad. All troops left Rappahannock Station for Culpeper. Enemy report Burnside's force 40,000. Scouts think only 20,000.

WADE HAMPTON,

Major-General.
