APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

American Commerce—Mr. Negley.
41st Cong....2d Sess.
It has been estimated that the people pay
taxes in enhanced prices for their carpets to the
amount of $17,000,000, to be divided among
these carpets manufacturers, while the Govern-
ment only gets §2,215,000 revenue from the
duties on carpets. A member of this House
on the Ways and Means Committee has said
on this floor that he can afford to give, every
time ho carpets his house, one of these compa-
nies a check for from $300 to $400 for the
privilege of buying his carpets where he chooses.
Mr. Chairman, our present taxation is too
burdensome. We should therefore relieve the
energies and industries of the people from it
by reducing taxes as much as possible. We
now have to raise annually a large revenue for
the support of the Government and the main-
tenance of the national credit. And it must be
done upon principles of equity, so as to dis-
tribute the burdens of taxation equally. Our
present tariff system was conceived and is con-
tinued too much in the interest of the few at
the expense of the many. Under it the rich
are becoming richer and the poor poorer.
While its effect is to enrich a few industries
it at the same time depresses and cripples
other and greater industrial interests. It taxes'
too heavily and too many of the great neces-
saries of life. It shackles trade with paralyz-
ing restrictions, and increases the cost of living
and production too much. It taxes the great
body of the people on many articles of gen-
eral consumption, not for the purpose of raising
revenue, but for the purpose of giving monop-
olists the control of our markets, and largo
bounties to enhance their profits. Although
the people of the State I in part represent are
not seen here thronging the corridors of this
Capitol, filling the antechambers of your com-
mittees, and crowding the galleries of this
House, thoy yet feel a deep interest in the
questions involved in this discussion. I hope
our legislation on these questions will not be
such as to disappoint their just expectations.

SPEECH OF HON. J. S. NEGLEY,
OK PENNSYLVANIA,
In 'rmo IIoijhk op Hupbuskntativks,
May 11,1870,
On tho bill (H. H. No. 1889) to revive tho navigation
and commercial interests of tho United .States.
Mr. NRGIjKV. Mr. Speaker, tho national
gravity of (he measure under consideration
may be realized by contemplating tho fact that
tiie decline of our merchant marine has actu-
ally arrested the attention of the entire civilized
world, and the magnitude of the public inter-
ests involved imposes upon this Congress tho
imperative duty of seeking a solution of the
causes and providing speedy and commctisu
rate remedies of this calamity.
Although the subject has been ably discussed
by tho eloquent chairman of the committee,
[Mr. Lynch,] I turn to it in obedience to the
highest sense of duty devolving upon me as a
Representative.
I believe in the axiom, " whosoever com-
mands the sea commands the riches of the
world, andconsequently tho world itself."
1 also believe and assert that a well-organized
and efficient merchant marine is equally as
essential to the political economy and safety of
our national independence as the construction
of railroads, canals, and other means of inter-
communication.
In support of this opinion I refer to tho lan-
guage of the honorable the present Secretary
of the Navy:
"In a country peopled like ours, and scnarated by
tbe sea from powerful neighbors, we need in times
of docae-itie peace only the organization and nucleus
of aland force; but with the prosperity which fol-
lows peace comes tho demand for protection to com-
merce which it fosters and the wealth which it
accumulates.
"Our prosperity, cither as a producing or a man-
ufacturing people, is measured by our commorce with
countries beyond the sea; and wiso statesmanship
and true economy alike require adequate protection
for this means of national wealth, both on the ocean
whore it is employed and in the ports where it is
organized, and whence it issues, and in which its
immediate results are accumulated."
You can go to the crowded quays of many
of the commercial emporiums of the Old World
without beholding the flag of our country at
the mast-head of a single vessel; and to give
greater significance to this deplorable fact I
quote tho following extract from a letter I have
lately received from his Excellency Blacque
Bey, envoy extraordinary and minister pleni-
potentiary of Turkey;
"All that I can tell now for the interest of tho
maritime power of tho United States is this strange
fact, which is to be regretted iu every respect, that
among twenty thousand vessels belonging to all
nations, which during the last year appeared in the
waters of tho Bosphoras, only one has been undor
tho flas of the American Union."
Our mines of wealth and fields of enterprise
are crippled by such a state of affairs, and our
patriotism, our intelligence, and our self-re-
spect are humbled so long as England is our
commercial factor and express on the high
seas. Thus we feed her greatest engine of
maritime power, which, like an enormous ma-
rine polypus, sends out branches and feelers
everywhere, draws in tho commorce and wealth
of the whole world, and as long as the foreign
merchant finds his own flag floaling over the
craft which convoys his merchandise to New
York, with the assurance of indirect subsidies
and lucrative return freight, ho will always
discriminate against American tonnage, no
matter how liberal inducements may be offered
to him by our private enterprises.
Our commercial and naval rivals not only
carry our freights, but they perform our postal
service, and the American traveleris compelled
to leave and reach our own shores on a foreign
steamer.
While we have been engaged in giving sta-
bility to our political institutions, directing our
energies toward the development of our agri-
cultural and mineral resources, and acceler-
ating the construction of railroads reaching
nearly twenty thousand miles during the last five
years, the venerable Government which crowned
the destroyers of our shipping with laurels, and
rejoiced over the success of tho Alabama,
seized with undisguised eagerness the eventful
period of our civil war and slow transition to a
permanent peace to construct a powerful steam
fleet with light iron propellers of great speed,
capacity, and durability, thereby revolutioniz-
ing the means of travel and transportation, and
inducing our own merchants to prefer these
conveyances a i a measure of economy and
security.
liul the commercial transportation on the
Atlantic is not the only direction, nor is Eng-
land the only country, in and by which our
legitimate trade has been gravely impaired.
France did not tarry in following England's
example to girdle the ocean with an electric
cable, and by her bold conception of the Suez
canal has opened a new maritime path of the
highest interoceanie importance.
These accomplishments are not only triumphs
of science, but also practical results in favor
of foreign commerce and naval power. But
for these successes our interoceanic railway
would have become the natural transit route
between Europe and Asia for the speedy con-
veyance of passengers and valuable freights.
The Suez canal partially neutralizes the in-
ternational importance of our Pacific road, and
if wo do not speedily succeed in establishing
powerful steam lines of our own across the
Atlantic, and especially to the Mediterranean
ports, England and France will be out of the
rcach of our competition in the command of
all the greatest and most important high-roads
of our trade.
There was a time, Mr. Speaker, when our
commercial marine was second to none in
ex pan si ven ess, and in proof of this assertion
I refer you to the following statement:

' Tonnage of
j vessels built.
According to theofficial returns the decrease
of tonnage in 1869 as compared with 1868
appears to be 207,117 tons.
It is very humiliating for ma to find that in
1850, when wo had nearly twenty millions less
of population and weregreatly inferior in indus-
trial facilities and resources as compared with
the present time, we built nearly, if not quite,
as many tons of American vessels as we did
in 1869.
It is alarming to observe that since 1864 our
tonnage i3 steadily decreasing, so that its
decline in the single year from 18G8 to 1869
reached the formidable figure of more than two
hundred thousand tons.
In 18G8 the total values of our imports and
exports (the latter reduced to gold rates) are
given in the following table;
