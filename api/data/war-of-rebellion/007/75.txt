FORT HENRY, January 21, 1862-6 p.m.

Scout informs me that the main body of the enemy made only a feint, and sent 1,000 only to Highland. Main body returned to near Murray, former position. Messenger from near Murray reports proceeding beyond Murray west. Works progressing well on south side. I do not feel satisfied about effect of high water on earth works at Henry. Say to Gilmer gunboat up at 4 o'clock p.m. opened on us. No harm done. I did not reply.
