GENERAL ORDERS, HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

Numbers 2. Winchester, January 9, 1863.

The general commanding has perceived with surprise and pain that some of the troops of this army have been engaged in the indiscriminate destruction of fences and houses, devastating a fair and fruitful country, on the productions of which salvation depends. Fields of growing wheat have been left without fences, and property, which even a rapacious enemy had respected, has been needlessly destroyed.

Such wanton acts of waste are unworthy the character of Confederate soldiers, injurious to the holy cause they defend, and are alike destructive of personal honor and military discipline.

This growing evil must be checked, and commanders and inspectors are enjoined to take all proper precautions in future to prevent such disgrace to our fair name. Inspectors will, in all cases, report to these headquarters by what troops such injuries have been inflicted. They will cause a rigid scrutiny into all such acts, and bring to punishment all offenders.

Citizens are invited to bring in their accounts for such injuries, when they audited and paid, and the amount charged against the responsible commander.

By command of General Bragg:

GEORGE WM. BRENT,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General JOSEPH E. JOHNSTON, Jackson, Miss.:

DEAR GENERAL: I replied promptly to your dispatch about the command of my depot at Chattanooga and of General Smith's department in East Tennessee. I regret exceedingly that my meaning was so imperfectly expressed as to convey any idea of dissatisfaction with you or any desire on my part to supersede General Smith. My sole object was to convey to you my most decided and emphatic conviction that
