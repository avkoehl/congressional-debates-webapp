So the amendment was rejected.
Dui in«; tiie call of the i oil,
Mr. PRICE stated that Mr. Allison had paired
with Mr. Fernando Wood.
Mr. J. C. ALLEN moved to lay the bill on
the table.
The motion was disagreed to.
The bill, as amended, was ordered to ^ thlid
reading; and was accordingly read thothird time.
Mr. WHEELER. 1 move to reconsider the
vote by which the bill was ordered to a third
reading. I do it for the purpose of correcting an
amendment which was inserted by mistake. I
will state whatitis: an amendment was repoi ted
and passed which required the company to pave
the stieet for six feet on cach side of the track in
addition to paving and keeping in repair the pave-
ment between the tiucks. That amendment was
not agreed to by the committee, and it was in-
serted by mistake. The original bill required the
company to pave two feet each side of the track.
The SPEAKER. If there be no objection the
amendment referred to by the gentleman from
Wisconsin will be stricken from the bill.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I think six
feet on each side of the track is not too much.
Mr. WHEELER. I was not directed to re-
port the amendment.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. Then to re-
lieve the difficulty of the gentlemen I ask him to
allow me to submit the amendment.
Mr. WHEELER. I will if the third reading
of the bill is reconsidered.
The motion to reconsider was agreed to.
The vote adopting the amendment referred to
was then by unanimous consent reconsidered.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I now sub-
mit that amendment as my own.
The amendment was agreed to—ayes fifty, noes
not counted.
The bill was again ordered to a third reading,
and was accordingly lead the third time.
Mr. ELDRIDGE. I move to lay the bill on
the table.
Mr. BEAMAN. Is that motion in order, the
same motion having been made and voted down ?
The SPEAKER". The motion is in order,
action having been bad upon the bill since the
motion was made by the gentleman from Illinois,
[Mr. J. C. Allen.]
The motion was disagreed to.
The question recurred on the passage of the bill.
Mr. ELDRIDGE demanded the yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken; and it was decided in
the affirmative—yeas 82, nays 47, not voting 53;

the Senate have passed the bill of tho House (No.
494) to increase the duties on import®, and for
other purposes, with amendments; in which he
was directed to ask the concurrence of the House.
Mr. MORRILL. 1 move that the bill be re-
ferred to the Committee of Ways and Means. I
suppose it is hardly necessaiy to have it printed.
Mr. BROOKS. 1 hope we shall be allowed to
have these amendments 111 print.
Mr. MORRILL. Very well, I move, then,
that the amendments be printed.
The motion was agreed to.
INDIAN APPROPRIATION BILL.
Mr. STEVENS. I am directed by the Com-
mittee of Wnyb and Means to roport back the
amendments of the Senate to the Indian appro-
priation bill, and to ask that they may now be
considered. We recommend a concurrence, in
oni' case with a slischt amendment.
Mr. BRANDEGEE. 1 object to the amend-
ments being considered at this time.
Mr. STEVENS moved that they be referred
to the Committee of tlie Whole 011 the state of
the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. STEVENS moved that the rules be sus-
pended, and the House resolve itself into the Com-
mittee of the Whole on the state of the Union.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly resolved itself into the
Committee of the Whole on the state of the Union,
(Mr. Washburne, of Illinois, 111 the chair.)
Mr. STEVENS moved to take up the amend-
ments of the Senate to House bill No. 240, mak-
ing appropriations for the current and contingent
expenses of the Indian department, and for ful-
filling tieaty stipulations with various Indian
tribes for the year ending June,30, 1865.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. BROOKS. What are those amendments ?
Do they provide for anything extraordinary?
Mr. STEVENS. They are all founded on esti-
mates from the Department, and some are to
carry out treaties made and ratified since the
original bill was passed.
The amendments of the Senate were severally
concurred in with one slight amendment.
Mr. STEVENS moved that the committee rise.
The motion was agreed to.
The House accordingly rose; and the Speaker

on the State of the Union had,accordmg to order,
had the Union generally under consideration, mid
pai ticularly the amendments of the Senate to the
Indian appropriation bill, and had directed him
to report the same back to the House, with the
recommendation that they be concurred m with an
amendment.
The action of the Committee of the Whole on
the state of tlie Union was concurred in.
Mr STEVENS moved to reconsider the vote
just taken; and also moved that the motion to re-
consider be laid upon the table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

Mr. STEVENS. Will there not be time enough
al'ior tlie momma; hour?
iM r I>; r K, "! Massachusetts. There will not.
Mr. PRICE. 1 hope that this bill will not be
nostponed. It Ims already been postponed from
