HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865.

General HENRY L. ABBOT,

Broadway Landing:

Is not the flag marked Twenty-sixth South Carolina instead of Twenty-sixth North Carolina? The Twenty-sixth South Carolina is in Johnson's division, and we have officers from that regiment.

Major-General.

BROADWAY LANDING, VA., March 31, 1865.

Major-General PARKE,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The lieutenant captured belonged to the Twenty-sixth Georgia Regiment. I suspect that McDonald confounded the Twenty-sixth Georgia with the Twenty-sixth North Carolina.

Captain CHANNING CLAPP,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Engineer Brigade:

CAPTAIN: I have the honor to report that I sent scouting parties on the 29th and 30th in all the different directions, pursuant to your orders, with no signs of the enemy discovered, not even the usual scouts that have infested this locality. I also sent out parties this morning at daylight. Nothing to be seen. I have established a line of vedettes outside the dismounted line, so as to thoroughly cover all roads approachable.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN TEWKSBURY,

Major, Commanding.

I reported yesterday to assistant adjutant-general Ninth Corps, as also this morning.

He desires you to continue to send out scouting parties, taking care, however, not to run down your horses. He wishes you also to continue sending him, as well as General Benham, any information you can gain of the movements and designs of the enemy.
