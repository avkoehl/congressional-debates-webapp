a dotted line. This house is far enough north on this map. The Forty-eighth [Pennsylvania] lies on the road. The wagons moved on nearly southeast of Bosher's and west of the road from Gilman's to the Woody house, this side of the stream from the swamp, I should think about in front of the center of the left of General Crittenden, some distance out. I don't think this map is very correct. At any rate, it is difficult to determine where my line is on it. Bosher's house is more than a mile from here by the direct road, and about a third of a mile in a line from where I am intrenching.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

General BURNSIDE,Ninth Army Corps:

GENERAL: The enemy made a sudden rush from the woods on the right of the hill, drove in my skirmishers, and rushed in simultaneously on the rifle-pit I was building, from which, in the confusion, the men fell back and the enemy now hold. My force at this point was some 300 or 400, and there was no excuse for not holding it. The surprise seems to have been complete, and shows that some one was to blame. One of my staff officers happened to be on the line at the time, and reports that the officer in command ran away, calling on his men to fall back. The fighting seems to be pretty sharp just now. I have ordered it to be reseized before the enemy can get any considerable force there, if possible.

Your obedient servant,

ROBERT B. POTTER,

Brigadier-General.

P. S.-One of General Willcox's staff reports just now that he was in position to see the enemy's advance, and it was a very heavy force.

[General BURNSIDE:]

GENERAL: I do not think it is possible to retake the position from the front, but perhaps from the right; but I will make a reconnaissance at once. It will take a strong force to do it, as the enemy's artillery fire is very hot.

General BURNSIDE:

At 12.30 p.m. Colonel Humphrey reported that his skirmishers had drive the enemy back to within 30 yards of the pits they gained from Colonel Christ. I do not find the reports of the enemy moving
