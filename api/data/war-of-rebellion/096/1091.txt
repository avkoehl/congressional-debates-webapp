FEBRUARY 11, 1865.

ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

A privilege was granted to Lieutenant-Colonel Tuckner to complete his regiment some day or two ago. If that enterprise be deemed of less importance than the one herein mentioned it might be proper to recall that order. Your opinion upon this is desired. No other authorities been given.

By order:

J. A. CAMPBELL, Assistant Secretary of War.

RICHMOND, VA., January 18, 1865.

General R. E. LEE,

Hdqrs. Army of Northern Virginia:

It has been reported to me that you had charged your opinion in regard to the extension of your command while retaining command of the Army of Northern Virginia. I therefore renew to you the proposition that you should exercise command over the Souther Atlantic States, together with Virginia and North Carolina, and now offer the larger sphere of all the forces east of the Mississippi River; or, if you think it practicable, that you should resume your former position of commander of all the armies of the Confederate States, with the addition of the immediate command of the Army of Northern Virginia.

Very respectfully and truly, yours, &amp;c.,

JEFF'S DAVIS.
HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, January 18, 1865.

(Received 9 o'clock.)

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War:

I fear for dispatch of Bragg he has been unable to save armaments of Forts Holmes and Caswell. Heavy guns will be necessary to defend approach by river. Can any be supplied?

R. E. LEE.
