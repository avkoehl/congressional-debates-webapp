HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,Kernstown, Va., November 27, 1864-9 a. m.

Major General LEW. WALLACE, Baltimore, Md.:

The following-named intensely secession ladies have made their way to Baltimore from the vicinity of Millwood and Berryville, viz; Mrs. thomas Carter and daughter, Mrs. Charles Clark, Mrs. Whiting, Mrs. Smith the two Misses Bell. Mitchell, and Mrs. Richardson. i want you detain them in your city until they get authority from me for their return. I am satisfied that they are unsafe people and should be watched closely.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,November 27, 1864.

Major-General COUCH, Chambersburg:

There is no danger of a guerrilla raid in the Cumberland Valley. If you have arrested spies, hang them; if you are in doubt, hang them anyway. The sooner such characters are killed off the better it will be for the community.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-general.

CITY POINT, VA., November 28, 1864-6.30 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK, Washington:If the Sixth Corps is moved here please send all the infantry before forwarding a single piece of artillery or wagon. I do not care the artillery coming here at present it is can be used elsewhere.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

CITY POINT, VA., November 28, 1864-8.30 p. m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Washington:

There is no evidence of any of Early's forces having come here except Kershaw's division; up to Saturday certainly none others had. It is highly probable, however,that Early may have been sending troops to Georgia by the way of Lynchburg, Burkeville, and Danville. The report from Sheridan looks as if the Sixth Corps could now be spared.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., November 28, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

General Grant directs me to say that it is not executed of you to give to the major-generals order to report to you commands of more than division.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
