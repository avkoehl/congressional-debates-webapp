th*é territory she claims      Inasmuch, therefoie, as this contro
versiy With Great Britain has assumed an aspect by no means
auspicious to the future harmony of the two nations, I am for
placing before our countrymen tins report as evidence ol the
justice of our claims, and of the position which oui Govern
ment has taken, morder that the public judgment, and with it
the public energies of the nation, may be concerní ated in sup
port of that claim, m any emergency to which it* adpistment
may give rise     With this view, I shall vole for the printing of

log 4th of July ] As he advanced m life; he acknowledged the
influence of feelings and sentiments which might be regaided
asborderimj on superstition Theie wis at all events, it ap-

Kultofacombina'ion of interests and sections, for the purpose
of plundering the people
The debate was continued by Me*sis Mr~R( ER, CUSH
MAN, GAMRREIENG, KIDDIE   md ROBERTSON
Mr HAII opp) rd the bill He wanted to t-ee the old works
cempieted, or put in a state of piobahle completion, before new
ones were authorized to be commenced His own opinion was
that few oftlvm if any, ever would be completed, so long as the
Government continued i) appropriate money for them since it
was not only for the m'eiest of the localities ihat money should
be expended there but alsoof thos who had charge or ite üw
bursement
Mr \I I EN of Ohio remarked that he had not risen to in
flict a speech on the committee at this time of the evening and
after a ten hours siiunj, when all must Ijp mxious to breathe
a different atmosphere than the one by which they were sin
rounded, especially when there was mi h a mass of business
yet to be acted upon, and but two da\s m which to do it But
he felt compelled to say, in nply to the gentleman from \cr
mont, who had ju^t taken bis eat fMr Hail,] that he was
greatly mistaken, in Mr Afs opinion, in the declaialion that
the harbor-now proeie^ing *\ou!d not be fin shed, so Jong as
money was supplied to keep them m a forvvaid mo\ement
The reason assigned is that the «iipenntendents weremteiested
m déla)mg iheir completion as tbey received a «alary foi
tbeirser\ieee, oi a commission en the monev expended, and
hence it was foi ihur advantie* to protract the time, and to
enlarge the expendí Mr A bawl he wa« acquainted with the
history ot several of tbehailnr1- m 3 ike I nc, an 1 he fully be
lievpd money hadne\et been moie ju Uciously, beneficiaih
and economically applip 1 The works were all under the
genera! control of skiliul officers of tht I nued States and the
immediate supeiintendentj who m < le the cmi'ixcts ard dip
bursement-*, h^thoughtj in no usance, íeceived !iiy thinglike
a fair equivalent far thur sen ices and who must, there tore, be
actuated by othpr c >n-i leiationa than a mere t ecunnry one

never known or heard oficie of peculation ot irand,and bat
ftwofbadmanaaement Then employment sa^el the expense
of keeping comparativ Iv h a;h oaii fhcers to perform the
same duties, and, he bellied, they were much more interest
ed m urging their works to a speedy termination rather than
the reverse Hwas true the«e liaibors continued ¡o make de
manda on the Tieasury but it was because the original plans
were not yet executed in s tme case'-, while m others expen
ence suggested deviations irotn them, for ti y were all matters
oí experiment when commenced He n M assure the oppo
nenta of the system that its friends would halt w here they were,
if they supposed the cost was t  be unreasonable, compared
with tb*5 advantagesto be derived from it but the) believed it
warranted by the Constitution, and that the necessities of the
countiy general and local, demanded its c< ntmuance, though
its benefits could only hi. duly appietiated by those who had
witnessed its effects
In the year 1825, there was but a single steamboat above the
Falls of Niagara, she making, "solitary and alont," an unpn.
fitable and haiaardous voyage once in ten days Irom Buffalo t
Detroit and back Then, too, there were but twenty or thin
smalt shallops, digmned, itistiue.by the name of schooners
now, instead of one steamboat, there are neaily sixty som^c
them of 800 tons burthen, costing an hundred thousand dollar
and more, and, as a cla<ss, inferior to none afioat instead of th
twenty or thirty shallops, there are now 200 ships brigs, an
s-cliooners, honestly such But this fleet never could have ha
existence but for the facilities for icceiving and dis< barging car
goes furnished by artificial harbors, constituting, also, places c
lefuge to which to flee in time of need There are few natura
harbors on any oí the lakes and till the consirumon of those b
the Government on Lake Erie, vessels wete often driven bi
storms lrom one end oí it to the other, unless sooner driven o
shore, or to the bottom Such was still the ca=e on LakesHu
ion andMichigan, and would long continue tobe, if the pohcj
so happily began and so advantageously prosecuted, was no\i
to be arrested
But the business on the lakes had but ju*.t commenced Ohir
had now 400 miles of canal m operation, and was constrnctirf
a* much more, Indnna was expending ten millions on cana't
andiaihoad-f, Illinois and the inímt Sute oí Michigan each
half as much These all tended to the lakes andwouli soon
very greatly increase the business upon them
Mr A thought there we e equitable considerations pertaining
to this matter, so fai as the West was concerned The peopb
of what was once the Northwest Tei ritory, had paid as laige an
amount of money into the Treasury foi duties on impoi'ed
goods a«! any equal number of people eUewhere for whatever
might be the doctrine south of the Potomac his own was, thai it
was not cotton, but consumers Wio paid the duties In addi
tien, they had paid tjxty tw« millions ior public lands, bemg
six tenths of all the leceipts from that source Ohio, alone, ha I
paid twenty two millions, more than one fifth of all the receipt
hut she had got butabout one sixth of the land, for much of hei
land was bought under the old system, when the mmimun
price was two dollars the acre If ence it had cost about one
dollar and seventy six cents, while the aveiage in the othet
States had been but one dollar and thirty one cents, making in
excess of more than five millions paid by Ohio He d d not
propose to ask its return in the piesent exhausted situation of
the Treasury, and had only alluded to it as a íeason whv he
thought we ought net to be especially astute in seeking to dis
cover how we might withhold oi entail appropriations for the
Northwestern Stausm general, and Ohiom particular The
intercut on the en ess refured to, fora«mgle year, would equ ¡1
all the money ever expended bv the- Geneial Government in
Ohio for her exclusive benefit without taking ihe appropna
tions for the National road into account, which were based up
on a totally different footing
In conclusion he would say he thought the opponents of the
new harbors ought to find better reasons for then opposition
than merely that some of the old harbors were vet unfinished
