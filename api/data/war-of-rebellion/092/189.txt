CAPTAIN: *

Fitted out my command with clothing during the night, and the next morning [November 16] we were ready for another campaign. Left Atlanta at 2 p. m. November 16; worked at tearing up the railroad from Atlanta to Covington. November 17 and 18, without rations or chance to forage. November 24, marched through the city of Milledgeville. November 26, Captain Wilde, Company A, of my regiment, was placed on the skirmish line at Sandersville by General Morgan; had a lively little skirmish with the enemy and were among the first to enter the town. November 28, went into camp near Louisville, where we remained till December 1. On the 30th I sent out a foraging party of forty men under command of Lieutenant Magee. I soon learned that a force of the enemy's cavalry had come between them and our picket and that they were cut off. I endeavored to make my way to them, but was unable to do so. The enemy chased me back to the picket-line, where three of them were killed. I found that my little party of foragers were fighting against a greatly superior force; that their retreat was completely cut off and they were in imminent danger of being captured. There was no time to report these facts to my commanding officer. I was satisfied that my foraging party were lost if they did not have immediate assistance. I moved my regiment out rapidly, sending word to Colonel Smith of my movements. Found the pickets driven back and the enemy. They fell back before us about half a mile, uncovering my foraging party and giving them a chance to join us. Awaited orders from General Morgan and moved back to camp. Nothing of special interest took place on the march from Louisville to the front of Savannah. Reached the latter place December 12. Threw up an earth-work in front of my camp. My command was employed in this work, making fascines, picket duty, &c.,
