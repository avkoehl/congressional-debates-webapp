Brigadier General R. S. GRANGER, Bowling Green:

To weaken your small force, by detaching to other posts, would hardly be prudent. Notify General Boyle accordingly.

LOUISVILLE, December 9, 1862

Major-General WRIGHT:

General Rosecrans telegraphs 3,000 of the enemy at Clarksville. Ordered Colonel Bruce yesterday to concentrate his forces. Fear he is in danger, or the force at Hopkinsville. He asks for re-enforcements. I have ordered General Granger to give any aid he can consistent with safety of Bowling Green. We have no artillery. Cannot Governor Morton send us a battery? Two companies of Fourth and two of Fifth Indiana Cavalry arrived yesterday from Carrollton, Ky.

J. T. BOYLE,

Brigadier-General.
