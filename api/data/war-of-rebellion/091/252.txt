Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and A. A. G., Hdqrs. Dept. of Washington:

General Sheridan wishes to know whether the road in Brown's Gap has been blockaded by fallen timber or not. General Sheridan is very much annoyed that he does not get some information about the enemy through Swift Run or Brown's Gaps. Keep parties out constantly to find out where the enemy are.
