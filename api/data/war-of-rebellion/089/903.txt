I think, however, you had better return as soon as convenient. I approve of sending Wheaton instead of Gibbon, as it leaves the reserves better posted along the lines for contingencies.

HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864. (Received 3.19 p.m.)

Major-General MEADE,

Commanding Army of the Potomac:

Major Driver, assistant adjutant-general, is just in from General Miles. His infantry is still on this side building bridges, with the exception of a small force on the other side. The cavalry are all over, and some skirmishing is going on about one mile beyond. As yet no indications of any movement on his flank. A contraband, whom they found at Armstrong's, came in this morning from the Boydton plank road, on the other side of Hatcher's Run. He says that Heth and Wilcox were moving out the Boydton plank road, on the other side of Hatcher's Run. He says that Heth and Wilcox were moving out the Boydton plank road yesterday and the day before, but that he did not see any this morning.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,December 9, 1864-3.35 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

Did the contraband say where Heth and Wilcox were going, and how far down the Boydton plank did he see them pass? Had he heard anything of Mahone?

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS SECOND ARMY CORPS,December 9, 1864-3.45 p.m.

Major-General MEADE:

The contraband knows nothing of Mahone. He did not know where Heth and Wilcox were going; merely that they were moving on the Boydton plank road. I gather from what he said that he had seen them on the Boydton plank road, nearly a mile or two beyond Hatcher's Run. It seems probable Mahone struck the Boydton plank beyond where the contraband was.

December 9, 1864-4.10 p.m. (Sent 4.15 p.m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I am unable to understand exactly the point where the contraband saw the division of Heth and Wilcox. Was it north of the crossing of Hatcher's Run, and did they move south across the bridge at Burgess'
