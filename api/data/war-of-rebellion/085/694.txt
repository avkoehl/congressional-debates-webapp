troops. We certainly need more troops, and therefore should not ask for unavailable but available force, as by asking for the former we amy not secure the latter. I will very willingly join in an effort to get any of the regiments stationed at Fort Gibson or Fort Smith, as that force could soon reach us, and, in my judgment, now ought to be within my command.

I have the honor to, be, Governor, your very obedient servant,

I have nothing more by telegraph. I have Saint Louis papers of the 3rd. They all show Price has some 20,000 men and must now be on this side of Osage. His movements, therefore, threaten Kansas. If beaten at Jefferson his retreating hordes will flood this region if we do not rally to resist them. Send me copy of your message early. I will use the telegraph to give immediate notice of its purport.
