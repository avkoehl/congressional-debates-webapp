Washington City, April 29, 1865-2.40 p.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond:

It is reported that a number of our men remain unburied at Cold Harbor, Spotsylvania, in the Wilderness, and other battle-fields between the Rappahannock and Richmond. You will please send a force to infer them, with directions as far as can be done to identify the remains.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,Washington, April 29, 1865-11.30 a.m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

Four corps of the army in North Carolina will march to Alexandria, passing near Richmond, leaving Raleigh probably on the 1st of May. You may order the Army of the Potomac and all the cavalry, except such as you think necessary to retain in Virginia, overland to the same place, starting as soon as they can be got off. Let them leave all ammunition and stores of every kind, except provisions and forage, behind, or to be sent by water.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., April 29, 1865-12 m.

Major-General HALLECK,

Richmond, Va.:

General Sheridan need not accompany his cavalry across the country, but may return here by water, with his staff, as soon as he sees his cavalry started. All his headquarters escort, wagons, and ambulances had better cross the country. Foraging off the country and all destruction of property I hope will be avoided.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

RICHMOND, VA., April 29, 1865.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

Washington:

General Ord represents that want of discipline and good officers in the Twenty-fifth Corps renders it a very improper force for the preservation of order in this department. A number of cases of atrocious rape by these men have already occurred. Their influence on the colored population is also reported to be bad. I therefore hope you will remove it to garrison forts or for service on the Southern coast and substitute a corps from the Army of the Potomac, say Wright's, temporarily.

It seems very necessary to prevent the rush of the negro population into Richmond and to organize some labor system in the interior immediately as the planting season will be over in two or three weeks.
