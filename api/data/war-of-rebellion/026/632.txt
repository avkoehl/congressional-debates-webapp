FORT MONROE, VA., April 18, 1863. (Received 1.30 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Your dispatch, by Lieutenant Beaumont, is received. I have long been in favor of occupying the point referred to. Will write fully by mail. May go to Suffolk to-day. It is closely invested. I was up to the enemy's batteries on the Nansemond yesterday. They have reopened the railroad from the Blackwater and are redoubling their efforts. One gunboat was disabled yesterday.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 18, 1863-8 p. m. (Received 9.10 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have been all day in Suffolk. We have ascertain that the enemy's force is about 38,000. There are four divisions. The largest, General Hoods', numbers 11,000. They have come for a campaign a not for a raid or a diversion. Hill's force in North Carolina, numbering 22,000, was to have joined them. Longstreet, French, Pickett, Hood, and Anderson are before Suffolk. I telegraphed General Peck yesterday to prepare to act on the offensive, and went over to-day to confer with him on the subject. He will attack a battery to-night, and if he succeeds he will attack one of the enemy's divisions to-morrow in force. I will write you in full in a day or two in regard to this department and the views contained in your letter.

JOHN A. DIX,

Major-General.

FORT MONROE, VA., April 18, 1863. (Received 11.50 p. m.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

Dispatches from General Foster state that General Hill has abandoned Washington. I have no doubt it is to carry out the plan of recapturing Suffolk and Norfolk. Our information, from a variety of sources, shows that this is the settled purpose of the enemy, and I am satisfied that nothing but a vigorous and successful movement on the part of General Hooker can prevent the intended co-operation of Hill and Longstreet, with 60,000 men, on the Nansemond.
