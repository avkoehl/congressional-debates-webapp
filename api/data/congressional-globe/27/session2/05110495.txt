ehould bo taken away from the departments, by law, in case
Congress, overburdened with business as it was, should neglect
to acü oo the subject A. practice that had prevailed from the
foundation ef the government, it was oow proposed to break
up, not because of present abuse, but because abuses might
hereafter, arise; and to hfzard the chance of making free com
roumcauons with Great Britain, except by deepatchtrg agent*,
Unless Congress should ptovide, by law, for it, befoie they ad
journod. If Congress was disposed to fix the time to the fi st
ef February, it wou'd be much better, and give more lime for
legislation on the subject
He submitted whether the language of this proviso was not
broad enough to prohibit sending bearers of despatches He
read the proviso, (as above given,) and said that tb^ wo ds
"compensation to sépante agent " covered as clearly bearers
of despatches as despatch agents The gentleman (rom Ver
montsaid, 'leave it to the cjecietaty of State to constiueit "
Ha knew, in case of necessity, they might get along m that
way, but he objected to it as imperfect legislation
The Committee ot Ways and Means had recommended a
non-concurrence m the amendment of the Senate, but, lest the
committee should not comp'v with the recommenLation, he
submitted an amendment, changing the time from the first of
July to the first of February
Mr. ADAMS said it was somewhat doubtful, during the pres-
ent session ofCongress, encumbered as they weie with business,
whether a systematic arrangement of those officers by law was
likely to be made Uhe gentleman's amendment would not
remedy the difficulty, What would be the consequence, sup
posing the recommendation of the Committee of Wajs and
Moans was not concurred in, and the Hou e concui red with the
Senate? What followed! That this mode of communication,
admitted to be proper, just, and necessary, should be stopped
If theypassed a law instructing the secretary of State to dis
miss all these agents a'once, where would be the mode of
diplomatic communication with all Europe and all America 1
Wb should have either to stop entnely diplomatic mtetcnurse
with the whole world, or be under the necessity of the Depart
ment of State doing, nom week to week, piecisely the same
thing, and making compensation to each agent for each time he
was employed
He therefore hoped the gentleman from New York would
withdraw his amendment, and let the question betaken directly
on the amendment of the Senate II, in the present state oi the
affairs of Government, foreignintei course was to be stopped,
and the Government brought to depend on rasual despatches,
thesooneritcaine the better He would rathent should take
place the 1st of July thin the 1st ofrebruaiy
He did not object to an> act of lesislation being passed to
make this thing ie,ularand peifectiy consistent with the pur
poses of the Constitution, as it might be understood by every
body: but he doubled whether,in the extreme occupation of
both Houses of Cuusiess, it would be possible to mature a
system on winch an act of legislation could be established in
the couise of the present session If this were rot done, and
the amendment was adopted, they might depuve the Pres
idem and the Department of State of the mems of pay nu,
perhaps, $2 JOO, they tvould «ave the salaty ol ihe agents at
New York, Boston Liveip >ol, and London, and we wou'd Ice
either t le lotal beuefl of frequent and repeated inteuourse vi ith
all our ministers and consuls abroad, or el-o the compensation
would necessarily be pan) to special agents for (he tiai emi-s on
of despatches on special occasion , at d he would answer for it,
that it would amount to as large a sum as the salaries they now
gave to these tfhceis
Mr A sent to the Clerk's table, where it was read, a letter
from the Department o( .-late dated 1833, to Mr Ogden, thtn
consul of thellnued States at L'veipoo!, complying with Mi
O 's demand for compensation as despatch agent at that port,
and giving directions concerning Ihe performance of the duty,
&C J also, a leaei from the legation of the United States at
London in 1P32 settmü foi th the necessity of some regular evs
tem for the transmití m ot comini ntcations to and horn our
foreign minister , mtonsequtme of whin letter lieuiesuutd
this allowance had since that time been made to Mij/Mtllei in
London, whom he knew peisoiallv, anil on whose chaiacter
for uprightness, honest), and a siduity, he passed an e ico

He had a number of o hoi letters i elating to the establish

diency, propriety, and n d ed nteesii v, ot a sjatem like that
finally established by the p etc t Secietary of State
He referred to the siat-ment of the gen leman from ¡New
York [Mr Wooc] that this was a sinecure, and readfroma
document from the Deoar ment of Sta e, containing an ac
count of the despatcnes received oy the despatch agen' atlNew

So far as the Cons Hution of he United stales hid to do wit i

Mr FILLMORE, st the suggestion, he said, of the gentleman
from Massachusetts, witi drew his amendment.
Mr F then proceeded to reply to remarks of Mr Jones,
of Virginia, as to the authority given by law for this appro
priadon lie (Mr V ) had not die law before h m, but, know-
ing that the House had adorned an order that no eppropriaion
should be ma It in this bill except such as w s authorized by
law, it waspioper thefíoasesnouid be ir formed wLauna  au
thouty was
Oh reference to the law, he found that the whole of our for
eigu intercourse seemed to have been managed under the gen
oral authonty given by the Constitution of the United Slates,
and that ail laws which had been pasped on the subject, instead
of granting powers, liad been re&tnctive The Constitutiop de-
clared that the President should ' nominate, and, by and with
the advice ard consent of the Senate, shall appoint ambassadon?,
other public ministers and consuls, ' <&c Ihese were ail 'he
officei  named and that was all the po wer given m theConstnu
tion Ye , under that simple p > wer, it had been the practice of
the Govenmiens fiom its commencement to the present time,
to appotntaii grades of ministers ard their secretaries, (so far
as secrétanos were allowed,) consu's and vice consuls, and, he
believed, commercial agentó All the enactments «pon
which he had been able to lay Jais faids had been enact
menu to regulate and restrict this power but which seemed all
to assume the power as given by the Constitution and the law
of nations
Mi F here read extracts from several laws in illustration of
this position, and, after some explanations between Mr Jones
of Virginia, and himself, concluded by lemarkinsj that he did
not object to the regulation of this subject by law Hut he ob
jectedi to any law or piovision which would unnecessarily em
bairass our intercourse with foreign nations Regular it, if
you please, he was in Javor of regulation, so far as it could be
done for the benefit of the country, but, he repeated, he did not
wish here to impose any resmctions which would embarrass
our foreign intercom se
Some conversation followed between Mr UNDERWOOD
and Mr CUsHING, a« to the construction to be put upon the
terms "separate agents," m th-1 amendment oí the Senate,
after which Mr USsDERWOOD made a lew remarks, di
rectedto 'he constitutional q leetion the object ot which was 'o
show mat this wa=  a pov\er which did not tome within the
constitutional objettion or limit laid dawn by him some days
ago
Mr POPE said that he was opposed to the proviso nf the
Senate, because it had the appearance of a censure, whethei m
tended oi not, on theExecutife, or a want o¡ confidence in it,
that he was himself ¿veit-e to anything like a spue action against
the Executive Admin «nation, whether a supporter orw oppo-
euion to them touch a couise did not comport with the dignity
and couitesy thit ought to be observed between the various
branches of the Government The President was made by the

protection     The great articles of necessity which entered into
the African trade were productions of the United States, and
could be furnished at a cheaper rate than those of a similar
kind supplied by English traders. Bngiishraen were depeo*
dent on tne productions of the United States for a supply of
those articles which enabled them to cariy on their trade wiu*
the African tribes No trader could do any thing m AJVica
without the arne'es of tobacco, gunpowder, and coarse coCton
goods The first of these was a great American staple* ana ¡a
cargo composed of the whole could be sent from the Unftea
States to Africa cheaper than from England
Mr. U trusted the amendment would prevail, and that tha
Government would take measures to place their traders upon
a footing equally favorable with those of Great Britain It the
s!a>e-„rade was to be arrested, it must be done by sending and
exchanging such ai tides as the negro wants, for the produc-
tions of the soil and forests of his own country, by teaching
him that he can supply the coatee necessaries of hfe, which -are
all that he aepnes to obtain, by giving some commodity m

The cpmmittee then (on the recommendation of the Com-

of me Senate, increasing the appropriation for the relief and
pi otection of American seamen abioad from thirty five to fifty
thousand dollars
All the amendments of the Senate were now disposed of
Mr FILLMORE rose and said, that he desired peimiesion to
make an explanation in some measure personal to himself which
hf felt due to the House and to others interested No objection
having been made, Mr F pioceeded to say, that the House
would recol ea that yesterday he read what purpotted to be the
copy ol a letter from Mi Woodbuiy to Mr Bowne, the com 
missiorer for building the custom house at New Yol k, dated on
the 3d day of March, 1841, that, after reading that letter, an
extiaU was read ftorn Mr Fomdextei s report, professing to
giveanextiactfrom that letter, which dilfeied, m some essen
ualwou'a, fiom ihe copy which he had, that he then stated
that he did not know wnether the copy which he had was coi-
rect, a** he received it from the Senate, with the other papers be
ioneme to the bill
This morning a member hid handed him a copy of that letter
from the Trrasury Depaitment which he was informed had
bsen since obtained, and which differed ftom the copy which he
had, and con esponded with the ex i act from Mr Pomdexter's
