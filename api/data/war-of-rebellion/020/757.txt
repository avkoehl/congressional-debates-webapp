NOTE.-Heavy artillery included with light artillery in the First District of South Carolina and the District of Georgia.

CHARLESTON, February 1, 1863.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

General Mercer reports serious attack him with iron-elad turret on battery Genesis Point, Ogeechee River; Major Gallie, commander, killed, and 32-pounder disabled. Garrison in good spirits. Ten forty-five a. m., indications of attack on Thunderbolt Battery; also musketry heard from pickets; also reports General Huner in command at Port Royal, and his intention to attack Savannah as weakest point. General Mercer would be materially assisted at such juncture by an officer like Henry C. Wanyne. Can he not be made brigadier and ordered there by telegraph? The substraction of over 2,000 of General Mercer's infantry, now at Wilmington, may prove mischievous.

Commanding District of Georgia, Savannah, Ga.:

GENERAL: I have ordered nine Rains torpedoes to be sent to you forthwith, to be put in the channel of the Ogeechee within range of Fort McAllister. I hope they will be found to answer, for notwithstanding the great importance of that work and of saving the Nashville, which I consider the sole cause of the attacks of the enemy in that quarter, it is utterly out of my power to send heavy gun to be added to the armament of Fort McAllister. I have ordered two rifled 24-pounders and one smooth-bore 24-pounder to be sent to you from here for the battery on the Altamaha. Meanwhile you will send at once a naval 32-pounder from the lines around Savannah to that work. You will also send to the same locality a 24-pounder and siege carriage, to be returned as soon as
