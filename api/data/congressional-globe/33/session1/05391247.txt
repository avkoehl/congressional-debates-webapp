Mr. WALSH. I move to lay the motion to
reconsider upon the table.
Mr: BANKS. I ask the Chair to read to the
House a precedent upon this point.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I object.
Mr. BANKS. I do not wish to argue the
question, but only desire to have a precedent read.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I object. There are con-
flicting decisions upon the point.
The SPEAKER. It is objected to, and it can-
not be read.
Mr. SAGE. I demand the yeas and nays upon

the table. *

take an appeal ?
The SPEAKER. The Chair will not entertain
an appeal. •
Mr. GIDDINGS. Did not the Chair entertain
a similar appeal when it came from the other side?
The SPEAKER. The Chair very reluctantly
entertained an appeal then, but he very decidedly
declines to entertain it now.

So the House refused to adjourn.
The question then recurred upon the motion to
lay the bill upon the table.
Mr. STUART, of Ohio. I move to recommit
the bill to the Committee of the Whole on the state
of the Union.
The SPEAKER. That motion is not in order
under an express rule of the House.
Mr. CAMPBELL. I demand the yeas and
nays upon the motion to lay the bill upon the
table.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I move that
there be a call of the House.
Mr. RICHARDSON. That motion is not in
order. The House has decided that a motion for
a call of the House is not in order at this stage of
the proceedings.
The SPEAKER. The gentleman from Illinois
demanded the previous question upon the report
of the Committee of the Whole on the state of the
Union. A motion that there be a call of the
House was made, and the House refused to order
it; thus indicating its purpose to vote upon the
report made by the committee. Since that time,
the condition of business has not been changed at
all. The Chair therefore decides that a motion
for a call ,of the House is not in order.
Mr. WASHBURN. From that decision I
take an appeal.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I submit that the gentle-
man cannot take an appeal. A motion that there
be a call of the House is not in order; and an ap-
peal from the decision of the Chair deciding that
it is not in order, is no more in order than it
would be on a motion that the House adjourn.
Mr. CAMPBELL. There is no appeal pend-
ing now, Mr. Speaker.
The SPEAKER. The Chair overrules the
point of order, and decides the appeal in order.
Mr. CLINGMAN. I move to lay the appeal
upon the table.
Mr. CAMPBELL. Upon that I demand the
yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
Mr. CLINGMAN. Upon further reflection, I
will withdraw my motion, and allow the vote to he
taken directly upon sustaining the decision of the
Chair.
Mr. WHEELER. I renew the motion to lay
the appeal upon the table.
Mr. SAGE. Upon that motion I demand the
yeas and nays.
The yeas and nays were ordered.
The question was taken upon Mr. Wheeler's
motion; and decided in the affirmative—yeas 1 IB,
nays 73; as follows:
