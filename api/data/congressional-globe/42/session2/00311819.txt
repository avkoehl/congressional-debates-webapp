JOSEPll W- fOWLB'S PATENT.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. I now de-
sire to report from the Committee on Patents
the bill to which I reierred a few moments
since, the bill (S. No. 646) to extend letters-
patent heretofore issued to Joseph W. Fowle.
I report it without amendment, and I ask that
it may be now considered and disposed of, as
it will take no time.
By unanimous consent, the Senate, as in,
Committee of the Whole, proceeded to con-
sider the bill. It proposes to extend the
reissued letters-patent numbered 2275, and
bearing date the 5th of June, 1866, to and for
the benefit of Joseph W. Fowle, for the fur-
ther term of seven years from and after the
11th of March, 1872.
Mr. FERRY, of Connecticut. There is a
report accompanying the bill, which can be
read if it is'desired.
Mr. HARLAN. I should like to hear the
report read.
The Chief Clerk read the following report
submitted by Mr. Ferry, of Connecticut,
from the Committee on Patents, on the 11th
instant:
The Committee on Patents, to whom was referred
the memorial of Josph \V. Fowle, respectfully re-
port as follows:
The memorialist, Joseph W. Powle, of Boston,
Massachusetts, is tile inventor of an improved rock-
drill, which was patented to him in the United
States, March 11, 1851, No. 7972, the patent having
been extended without opposition from the public,
so that the extended term will expire March 11,
1872. The patent was reissued J une 5, I860, No. 2275.
This rock-drill, or drilling machine, or engine, with
some modifications, but embodying the gist of the
memorialist's patented invention, is now, and for a
few years past has been, made and sold by the Bur-
leigh Rock-Dnll Company, of l?itehburf:h, Massa-
chusetts, and such drills are those which have been
and are still employed in the Hoosac tunnel, and all
over the country in quarries, cuttings, tunnels, and
wherever rock has to be removed in large Quantities.
In working the first small machine of the memo-
rialist's invention, he was exposed to wet and cold,
and contracted rheumatism, which steadily increased
until it became chronic and inflammatory, and his
hands, arms, legs, and feet had become distorted to
such an extent that from that time, and ever since,
he has not been able to dress or undress, to cut his
food, or to work. Under these circumstances, he
endeavored to interest parties in his invention; for
lacking means, health, and credit, he must wait an
indetinite period or part with a considerable trac-
tion of the invention to procure means for devel-
oping its merits, and for its introduction to public
notice. At this time the memorialist was under
medical treatment, and earned the money to pay for
his support and expenses by making small machines
and models for others.
In the early part of 1850 the memorialist made an
airangement by which he assigned one half of his
invention to a party representing that he possessed
money, influence, and business ability to devote to
bring this invention to public use and notice.
December 16, 1850, the memorialist filed his appli-
cation on which the patentafterward issued, and the
assignee mentioned arranged^ to build a drilling-
muehino under your memorialist's supervision, and
from his drawings and directions. This machine
was begun in June, 1850, and completed in Septem-
ber of thesame year, and operated successfully; but
as the assignee did not pay for it, it was not deliv-
ered, and was not long after dismembered, ana the
engine and boiler were put to other uses.
Said assignee also failed to pay as agreed for tho
patent, and the memorialist had out of his scanty
means to furnish part of the money needed to secure
the issue of the patent. Said assignee informed the
memorialist of an offer to purchase the patent for
$8,000, which, though fai below its value, the memo-
rialist urged acceptance of, but the assignee, m an
attempt to obtain more, failed to get anything.
The memorialist could find no one to purchase 1
fractional interest, and no one to purchase the wholo
at the rate asked by the assignee, and the memo-
rialist had no means for proceeding in equity to rid
himselt of the incumbrance of the assignment lor
which the consideration had failed. Thus the me-
morialist, without fault orneglect on his part, failed
for many years to secure the adoption of his inven-
tion by the public. At about the time when the
first term of the patent was near expiration, a re-
sponsible solicitor of patents was induced to take up
the case at said solicitor's risk and expense, and the
extension and reissue before named were obtained,
and when the extended patent had but about live
years to run a negotiation was made by vvii'cii lie
sold the extension to Charles Burleigh, oi JHtcli-
burg, Massachusetts, but owing to the limited term
remaining of the extension, no considerable price
could be obtained, and after deducting the expenses
of the extension, reissue, and negotiation, the memo-
rialist received 85.000.
The memorialist expended, oyer and above his
receipts, before and soon after the date ot his po tent,
about two thousand dollars, so that m fact all the
net receipts derived from his invention by the memo-
rialist are about three thousand dollars, less than
an annual receipt of $150 during the existence ot the
^Ihis'invention was made in advance of the abso-
lute requirements of tho age, though with the bodily
energy of which the memorialist has been bereft nยฎ
