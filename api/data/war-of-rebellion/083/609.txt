ing been placed in a commanding position on the hill. After forming on the bottom, I sent part of the Second Colorado Cavalry, on foot, as skirmishers through the woods. The Twelfth Kansas State Militia were also sent into the woods on foot, doing good service. The footmen kept steadily driving the enemy until the advance of the whole division was ordered when our old position was regained and after a short fight the enemy was completely routed, and fled precipitately from the field. Every one advanced as speedily as possible, continuing the pursuit until dark. Colonel Jennison, with portions of the Fifteenth and Sixteenth Kansas Cavalry, and Second Colorado Cavalry in the extreme advance, ran on to the main body of the enemy, and kept up a rapid fire upon him from his line of skirmishers, but the enemy opened a battery of rifled guns upon him, he, of course, fell back, having no guns to respond with. The brigade went into camp for the night at Little Santa Fe, with the exception of the force with Colonel Jennison, which camped about a mile in advance of the division. As soon as the brigade was reorganized on the morning of the 24th, I started on the Line road in the pursuit of the rebel army, having the advance for the day. I sent three companies forward as an advance, which did not return to the brigade until the morning of the 26th, at Fort Scott. For an account of their service while absent, see inclosed marked F.* Reached West Point at dark, where a halt was made, giving the men time to kill and eat a beef. After forming the brigade in line, I was ordered to wait until Major-General Pleasonton's division passed to the front. Started again about 2 a.m. of the 25th, and halted until daylight about three miles north of Trading Post, Kans.; distance traveled about sixty miles. After feeding the horses, I took up the line of march, being in the rear of the First Brigade, which position I kept during the day. After following the enemy's trail seven or eight miles beyond where he left the Fort Scott road, I received orders to proceed to Fort Scott, reaching there about 11 p.m., and camped for the night. Total distance traveled during the day probably sixty-five miles. At Fort Scott on the morning of the 26th instant, I reorganized my brigade, a great many of the horses having given out in the last two days. I left one section of the battery there, putting eight horses to the guns and caissons which I took with me. Again commenced the pursuit about noon, the time being consumed in drawing horses for the battery from Major Hunt, chief of artillery, Army of the Border.

From this time until the afternoon of the 28th we continued marching night and day, with but short halts and small feeds, following at all times the trail of the enemy. About 10 a.m., my brigade being in the advance we discovered the enemy's rear in the edge of the woods north of Shoal Creek. I sent two companies of the Sixteenth Kansas Cavalry into the woods as skirmishers, who soon reported that the party was about 200 strong and retreating fast. I then pressed rapidly forward, and, upon reaching Granby, ascertained that they had just passed through and that Price's whole army was doubtless at Newtonia, distant five miles. The advance soon reported that the enemy's train was in sight and but few men visible. I hurried forward at a gallop, and when within two miles of the town saw the rear of the rebel train entering the woods beyond town on the Cassville road. The battery was immediately planted on the bluffs and commenced throwing shell, while the Sixteenth Kansas Cavalry and Second Colorado Cavalry were
