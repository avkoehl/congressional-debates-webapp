would ask, in return, of what was the gentleman's

of the factions and fracfons of aH paiues and all
opinions'' What kind of disciplining was necessary
to keep such a party togethei, and to secure their
united strength1 It was well known that there were
factions and malcontents under various names, and
disposed to be governed by diffeient principles
When such factions spring up they are put t > the
off wheel If there to any deposition to back, they
are held by the breeching—if deposed to be restive
and run forward, a taughi rein restrains them In
the «•bscnce of a disposition to pull true, 01 as the
Dutch teamstei expresses, it, "if they tak" the
stud," the timely apphoat on of the ¡ash makes all

thtss terms been thiown at the administration, and
its supporters m the most taunting tones of insult
from ib first day of this session? He had been
p -ovcicd (new and inexperienced as he was m the
s íence of Congressional legislation) to inquire of
gentlemen who indulged in their tirades, whose
pets the local banks were1 If gentlemen meant to
throw them on the admimstiation, on the demo-
cratic parly, as their pets, he repelled the chsuge as
false and unfounded, and as a base slande*- against

an exposition of their principles Hostility to banks,

privileg-s, were watchwords wilh the demociacj,

Why w ere the filthy and deceitful rags of such a
creation and paientagc called the ouneney <->t the

from the commencement to the last official act of
his administration, it was General Jackson's
cojeet to establish the constitutional cunencv — a
emrenev ot t'old and silver—a ouneney that was
dirahle, of mtiinsic value, and uniform
The majority of the House had been chaiged
as being under Executive influence, and the people
ot being corinpled by the same influence, he had
little to say, so tar as personally, concerned,

and poi-onrus, but which earned with them their
antidote \s to the \ eople, however, he had some

SPEECH OF MR. RARIDEN,
Or  INDIANA,
In the House of Representatives, Septembei 25,1837—•
Upon the bill to postpone  the  pa} ment ot  the
fourth instalment of the surplus ¡eve! ue
The amendment of Mr   Thompson of South
Carolina being under consideration m Committee
of the Whole on the state of the Union—
Mr RARIDEN lose and said Sir, I feel great re-
luctance in obtri ding any remarks of mine upon
tms House at any time, but especially at this early
period of my congressional life But, said Mr R
I came heve, resolved that upon all and any mea-
sures effecting the weal or w oe of this Government,
to ac* upon the suggestions of my own unders'and-
mg, regardless (f the quarter from whence they
might origin xte, oi the ^riends or pari y who might
advocate or oppose tnem Yes, sir, I came heie
with a full puipose of heau io givp the administra-
tion a fair hearing, and a bona fide support in all
mea mes which m my ommon «oull ledound to
the interest o'this nation, and ha1 ng made up my
epi non upon bus old adverse to the Executive *c-
eommendation, it behooves me to -now some good
reason toi that opinion, or I might subject myself
io the chaige of wanton opposit on
Sir, said Mr R I am aware, too, of die del ca~y
of the situation m which an humble individual
places himself, when he sets up his opinion in
grave matters of St"te against those of men exalted
to the highest places upon the credit of supeuor en-
dowments, and more than common devotion to the
good of the country I am aware, too, sir, that my
position is less eligible for a coirect conclusion—
that I am less removed fiom causes which might
mislead the judgment, than is the Chief Magistrate,
and was there not a very decided preponderance in.
mv mind against the measure recommended and
embraced m this bill, I might surrendei my own
judgment and acquiesce, but upon this occasion I
cannot, but I am disposed to accoid to the Chief
Magistrate the sam  punty of motive in the recom-
mendation, that I claim foi myself m opposing it,
and p'ace the whole upon the giound of an honest
difleience of opinion
Sir, I cannot view this bill as simply intending to
withhold from the States the fourth instalment of
the surplus revenue This is a false and mistaken
view of i* This will rot be its practical effect, for
it must be kept m mmd that this surplus, the pay-
ment of which to the States is to be indefi-
nitely postponed by this bill, is already with
the Sta es in the deposite banks, and is the
basis of a portion ot the circulating medium
of the States, and to postpone its payment
to the States by the INational Tieasury, means
nothing more oi less than to withdraw from the
States tbis basis of their circulating medium, by
withdiawing from the deposite banks m had mo-
ney a sum equal to the amount to which eacn State
is yet entitled, under the provisions of the deposite
law and whilst this ruinous measure, which will
be most sensibly felt by the w estern and south-
western States, is piessed forward, we find another
measure, (cla mmgthe same fraternity)—(referring
to the bill to postpone the collection of merchants'
bonds)—the effects ot which will be to leave
w ith certain States several millions of money, of
which the Treasury is at this time m want, and to
which, under existing laws, it is now entitled
The few remarks which I design to make are
with a view to illustrate the positrons just assumed
This question has been discussed by some gentle-
men as though there was an angry and rival inte-
