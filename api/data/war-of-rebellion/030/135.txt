Brigadier General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Mann's Michigan cavalry are ordered to the Army of the Potomac. You have recently had 4,000 sets of horse equipments, 3,600 carbines and Colt's revolving rifles, with all the necessary appurtenances, and all the swords and pistols for which you have called. Lately you have received a far larger proportion of cavalry arms than any other commander. Which of your cavalry regiments are insufficiently armed? What were their numbers originally, and what arms had they? What are their numbers, now, and what arms have they?
