Sunday, the 11th instant, in which he said that they would have East Tennessee again, even if they had to withdraw every man from Richmond and Charleston. A captain of Arkansas cavalry, who deserted to us this morning, and of whose honesty we have proofs, says that only one brigade has gone from Bragg to Mobile, and that another has taken its place. He says an additional force of 30,000 men is promised to Bragg's soldiers, and that the conviction everywhere prevails among both people and army that unless they can recover East Tennessee the Confederacy is ruined. Having lost Texas they have no other place to procure cattle. The official report of rebel killed and wounded at Chickamauga makes the number 17,000. Efforts are anxiously made here to complete our inner fortifications. Were they finished 10,000 men could hold this place against the world, leaving the rest of the army to operate against the enemy, or to retire to points where it could be more easily subsisted while covering the approaches to Chattanooga. But by some strange improvidence the needful tools are not here, and instead of working 10,000 men per day, General Smith is only able to work 1,000.

Before General McCook left, General Rosecrans gave him a letter stating that McCook had never disobeyed an order.

Atlanta Intelligencer of yesterday has report of Jeff. Davis' visit to Bragg's army. He arrived at the camp on the evening of the 10th, reviewed the troops on the 11th, and was to return to Atlanta on the 13th. Intelligencer says he was received with great enthusiasm by troops, which is false. Raining here again.

CHATTANOOGA, October 14-8 p.m.

Rain continued through the night with great violence and still falling. Barometer indicates no change. Sequatchie River has risen so that it can no longer be forded near Jasper, and all wagons are now compelled to make the circuit to Therman, while the mud in the roads constantly grows deeper.
