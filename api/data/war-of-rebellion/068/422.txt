(Received 2 a.m.)

Major-General HALLECK:

I want General Parke very much but I know of no way for him to get here unless an extra train is sent. Some 60,000 rations for one of the brigades was carried off by the cars through mistake. If they could be sent at once on a train under strong guard General Parke could come with it. It is of the utmost importance that the 60,000 rations be sent to this place to-night.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., May 5, 1864.

M. J. McCRICKETT,

Some 60,000 rations were sent back from Rappahannock by mistake. They belonged to Burnside's supplies. Do you know where they are? They are needed by General Burnside. If you get prompt orders to send them out, can they be sent out between this and daylight? General Parke wishes to go out with this train.

JAS. A. HARDIE.
