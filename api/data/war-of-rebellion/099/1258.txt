President JEFFERSON DAVIS,

Richmond, Va.:

Enemy's movement from Winnsborough toward Catawba River seems to be more positive. He has withdrawn from vicinity of Chesterville, which will enable Cheatham and Stewart to reach here via Newberry and Unionville. Enemy may now probably move on Cheraw and Fayetteville. I have given orders accordingly to General Hardee. Could not all our forces be united against Grant?

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,February 23, 1865.

General BEAUREGARD,

Charlotte:

If enemy turns east McLaws will be in danger. Hasten him forward, also mass all troops in your rear to retard and embarrass enemy until you can bring them forward. They must march vigorously.

Major-General Stevenson's command, about 2,000 effectives, was within one days' march of this place; Major-General cheatham's corps, of about the same strength, was at or near Newberry, S. C. ; Lieutenant-General Stewart's, say 1,200, a day's march in rear of Cheatham; and Lieutenant-General Hardee'; s forces, probably at or in the vicinity of Florence. The telegrams from General Hampton last night intimated that the enemy was moving eastwardly, possibly to Cheraw by Camden. Cheatham and Stewart have been ordered to come directly to Charlotte, in case Sherman's movement toward the east be confirmed, and Hardee directed to press forward to the north of Chewaw, but to delay the enemy's march by obstructing roads, &amp;c. The work of blocking roads, destroying bridges, and filling up fords, south of this place, will be pressed with vigor. The people of the country will furnish
