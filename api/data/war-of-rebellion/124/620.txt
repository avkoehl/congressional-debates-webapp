Major FREDERICK TOWNSEND,

Eighteenth Infantry, Actg. Asst. Provost-Marshal-General for Northern Division of New York, Albany, N. Y.:

MAJOR: I inclose herewith letters to the Boards of Enrollment for the Twelfth, Eighteenth, Nineteenth, and Twentieth Districts of Nw York, directing that a draft be made for 2,013, 2,310, 2,387, and 2,448 men, respectively.

You will not commence to draft without first notifying me by telegraph that you are ready to do so, in any of the above districts, in order that I may inform the Governor.

I am, major, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

(Similar letter sent August 3 to Major O. A. Mack ordering draft in Third District, New Hampshire, for 1,769 men.)

ALBANY, August 3, 1863.

Colonel JAMES B. FRY, Provost-Marshal-General.

I am about to leave to-night for Oswego to put the draft through there to-morrow. I have been informed that the draft throughout the whole State is to be stopped. I can hardly believe this, although the information comes very direct from Governor Seymour. Please inform me at once whether this information be correct. I trust not. Answer quick.

Major A. S. DIVEN,

Actg. Asst. Provost-Marshal-General, Elmira, N. Y.:

Have the companies of the Invalid Corps from Louisville joined you yet? If you are here Tuesday morning, can you get back so as to direct things in Buffalo on Wednesday? From what I can learn, Buffalo is the next most dangerous place to New York City, and I hope you will be there in person.
