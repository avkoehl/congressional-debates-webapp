settlement of engineers' accounts.
Mr. WILSON. I ask the unanimous con-
sent of the Senate to take up House joint reso-

Mr. EDMUNDS. Let it be read for inform-
ation.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The title
of the joint resolution will bo read.
The Chief Ci.eiik. 'â€¢ A joint resolution
(II. R. No. 154) in relation to the settlement
of the accounts of certain officers and agents
who have disbursed public moneys under the
direction of the chief of engineers."
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Is there
any objection to the present consideration of
the joint resolution?
Mr. EDMUNDS. I object, until I can hear
it read, as I asked for information.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. It will be
read through.
The Chief Clerk read the joint, resolution.
It directs the Secretary of the Treasury in the
settlement of the accounts of Captain George
W. Cullum, Captain James B. McPherson,
Captain Charles E. Blunt, and Lieutenant John
C. Palfrey, of the corps of engineers, to allow
to the credit of Captain Cullum the amount
receipted for to him by Charles H. Bigelow; to
the credit of Captain James B. McPherson
and Captain C. E. Blunt the amounts receipted
for to them respectively by Abiel W. Tinkham;
and to the credit of Lieutenant John C. Pal-
frey the amount receipted for to him by John
J. Lee; and to the credit of John J. Lee the
amount receipted for to him by L. H. Eaton ;
but Charles H. Bigelow, Abiel W. Tinkham,
John J. Lee, and L. II. Eaton are each to be
held to the same accountability to the United
States for the amounts transferred to them,
respectively, at the time of transfer, and for
advances made to them from the Treasury, as
was at the time of transfer required by law and
regulations from officers of the corps of en-
gineers. This authority is to have no farther
application than to such accounts as have been
already examined and approved by the chief
of engineers, and are found to contain a full
and satisfactory accounting for all the public
money which came into their hands, namely: C.
H. Bigelow, $38,351 74; J.J.Lee, $3,508 95;
A. W. Tinkham, $12,910 13; L. H. Eaton,

upon the fortifications of tlie States of Massa-
chusetts, New Hampshire, and Maine.

after the enacting clause, in the following
words:

vide for holding of the courts of theTJnited fetntes m

hereby declared to be in tail iorce and efieet.
Mr. TRUMBULL. As the bill refers to
former acts without setting them out 1 will
