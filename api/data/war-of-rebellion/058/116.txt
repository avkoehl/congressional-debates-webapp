C. A. DANA.

KNOXVILLE, January 17, 1864.

General GRANT:

Dispatch received. I sent orders some time since for the twelvemonth's Kentucky troops to remain in that State, and so notified Governor Bramlette at the time.

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General, Cavalry.

KNOXVILLE, January 17, 1864.

Major-General GRANT:

General Sturgis occupied Dandridge and the country for 5 miles in front on the 14th. As soon as Granger arrives in support with the Fourth and Twenty-third Corps, Sturgis will push the enemy in front and occupy as far up the north bank of the river as possible. I shall cross the Fourth and Twenty-third Corps to the south side, and occupy the entire country to the south and east of the French Broad River. This being done, I shall make a threat with cavalry on Longstreet's rear. These disposition will give us good foraging ground, where we can live for six weeks, and it also gives us an advantage in position. I do not except to hold it without some fighting.

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General.

KNOXVILLE, January 17, 1864.

Major-General GRANT:

The Fourth and Twenty-third Corps are at Dandridge. The enemy is in some force near Kimbrough's Cross-Roads. Sturgis skirmished heavy with them yesterday. I shall cross all the infantry of these two corps to the south side of the French Broad to obtain food and forage to keep Longstreet's forages out of that section, and also to threaten his flank.

J. G. FORSER,

Major-General.

DANDRIDGE,

January 17, 1864-6.30 p. m .

General FOSTER:

There is no doubt but that Longstreet's whole force is immediately in our front on the Bull's Gap and the Bend of Chucky roads. They advanced on us this evening. We have no means of crossing the river. I shall fall back on Strawberry Plains.

Your obedient servant,

JOHN G. PARKE,

Major-General.
