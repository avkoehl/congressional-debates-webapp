Can I not take the supply train which came to this point from Reynolds' Station loaded with provisions and then put it to running between Murfreesborough and McMinnville? When will the Thirty-eighth Regiment (Indiana) be here?

I don't want your division or your train to move yet. Go only with an escort. The trains already there will suffice for the present.

Please send your regiments as rapidly as possible to Louisville. The enemy is advancing upon Kentucky and no time should be lost.

LOUISVILLE, KY., August 16, 1862.

Major General H. W. HALLECK:

I am not apt to act without advice. General Buell advised me that he requested Governors Tod and Morton to send me troops. He directed me to call for them. I have advised General Buell of your dispatch. I shall ask Governor Tod for no troops, and have not done so without authority, except when Morgan made his raid and I had not over 2,000 men, scattered everywhere. General Morgan believes he is in danger. I think so myself, but I am without relief. I shall send some of my new cavalry on that line. The road should be placed in order before frost. Shall I impress 1,000 negroes for purpose?

J. T. BOYLE,Brigadier-General, Commanding.
