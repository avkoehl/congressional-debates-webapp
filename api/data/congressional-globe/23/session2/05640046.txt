The question bcinsr on Mr  Di vxv's lesolution  I
to aim nd die i solution so as 'o substitute the  I
Committee on \1 inufactmes for the Committee
of Wat s and Me ins,
Mi DIOKER&ON s id, that at the fust view
oe this subject lie had been impressed with the
belief that it pioperly belonged to the Committee
of Ways and Means, but upon mature delibera
tion he wis convinced it was more appropriately
lefaable to the Committee on Mamifactmes If
the object (said Mr D ) was to inquiie whether
the duties which aie alieady paid into the Treas
uiy on locomo'ive engines were to ot reftnded,
then it might be i pioper subjett foi the Coram t
tee of Ways aid Means But this is not the
stati of the qui stion It will not be contested here

Mi MISON, of Vi gima, said this was a
men quistion of lefeience, although it had leen
aigutd is though the fate of the pioposition was
mvo'ved in the inquuy He refined to th ilia

postd to allow a diawback on ceitam ameles in

pi rtamly tin province of the Committee of Wiys

he hoped the am ndment wou d not piivail
Mi   CLAYTON said that the adoption of the
amendment would, in effect, deftat his pioposi
tion     It w is the duty ot the Housi  to tike caie
ot all the gnat mtensts of the coun ly      Pen
this purpose, then were committees of diffeient

be foi success fiom such a quartet ?    Some of the
minufai tuieis, he believed,  would lathei  have
then eye tei th di iwn, than to submit to the loss
of the piofit on a fom ptnny nail     The Commit
tie of Ways and Means, having the caie of the
revenue, was the proper one to j ldgt between tht
two interests alluded to      flic Govtinment can
not do without levenue, and it was foi the com
mittie chaiged with that subject to examine how
far the proposed measine would lilett the finances
of the counti y     He tiusted that the amendment
j would not be adopted
I     Mi   DENNY ntei red to the precedents of the
i last session, and contended that thiy wtie not
similar ti the pusent pioposition     In the casts
which   had  been  ípftiitd   to, the  ameles  hid
alie idy been lmpoi ted, and the dutii s were either I
pud in o oi  secured bv the   Iieasuiy     It was
pioposcd to remit those duties, and as a subject
j meiely of levenue they were lefeiredto tlioCom
imttceof VYays and Means     The pieseut piopo
sition pioposed iwidei lange, it went not meiely
| to ¡emit the duties on aitides already lniput d,
I but to abolish the duties altogetliei on futuie nn   j
portations, and  thus to chinge the tatill, which
was undeistood to be settled by compromise   for '
some time  to  come     But the gentlemm from
Georgia [Mi Clayton] had spoken of this prop-
ositionas one of agnculture    There had been no
memorial from the agricultural inteiest on the
subjett, noi had it been ltcommcndtd bv the
Committee on Agncultuie It was then meiely
the application of an individual membei The
g ntl"man be lieved that the manufaptuicis would
ntl er 1 a;e then ey  teeth di awn, than submit to
the loss of the piofit on a foui penny nail theie
wtit, perhaps, otheis win wiuld lathei seethe
Union d ssolvcd, than submit to pay a duty on a

Mi SPLIGHT said, if this was a question in-
volving tht quantum of pro'cction ntccssaiy to
paiticuhi uticli s of mannfictuie, he nnghtagiee
with thegentltman fiom Pennsvlv una [Mi Dev-

ftitnt n ituit It pioposed to allow a di iwb itk

affecting the levenue of the count") This was
i ot the first time, wlipn thi qaesti m of jtnsdic-

not dispos d to disttub it, and it was a mtasuie
whith give good giounds to the gentleman fiom
Pennsylvania to rejoice
It, howevei,in the progiess of events, it be-
came appaient that mv ]>art of tha act opeiated
with ui due oppicssion, it vvas ceitainly pioper
th it it should undeigo íevision and amendment
Mi S lead fiom the Journal of last session to
show that on scveial occas oils, suljettsof a like
nuuiP to the piesent had been rcfcired, w thout
objection, to the Committee ot Ways and Means,
and that bills bad been repoited a/>d passed m
confoimity to the ncommendations of that com
mtttee These bills, howevei, weie intended to
bentfit a difieient section of the countiy No
question of jiuisdn tion was then jaistd In the
cotuse of six y ars' seivittm this House, he
behevtd the umveisal piactice had been to send
all questions involving a leduction of duties to
the Committee of Ways and Means
Mr STEWART said, that upon lus resolution
of inquuy, it seemed the subject of the tariff was
to undeigo a gi net al discus ion If the gentle-
man from Noi th Carohn i [Mi Spfichi ] desired
that the compromise at,t, as it was called, should
be lepealed, he should hive his hearty conctn-
lence If this subject was to be discussed on
isolated points, he would ask, wheie would it
end > The present proposition was said to in-
volve the inteiests of agiiculture If so, why not
extend it, and piopose to abolish tht duty on
plows and hmows' In ordei to an est what he
conceive d a most unnecessary discussion, and to
test the disposition of the House on the subject,
he moved to 1 iy the h solution on the table
