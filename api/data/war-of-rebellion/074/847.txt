Report of Lieutenant Colonel Alexander A. Greene, Thirty-seventh Alabama Infantry, of operations May 7-June 2.
HDQRS. THIRTY-SEVENTH Regiment ALABAMA IFNTY.,June 2, 1864.

SIR: I have the honor to submit the following report of the operations of the Thirty-seventh Regiment Alabama Infantry from 7th on May to the present date:

On the 7th ultimo the regiment took position to the left of Mill Creek Gap in front of Dalton, Ga., on top of Chattoogata Ridge, between Mill Creek Gap and Trail Gap. The extent of the line running along the crest of the ridge was about one mile and three quarters. My men set to work here with great alacrity, and constructed a path along the top of the ridge from one gap to the other, and also prized up huge stones and poised them, so that one man could easily set them off.

Arrived at Resaca, took position on the extreme right in front of Resaca on Friday, 13th of May. Remained here until Saturday evening near 4 p.m., when Stewart's division was ordered forward.

They retired very rapidly. Proceeding 200 or 300 paces farther, the command came in range of the enemy's artillery, which commenced a furious fire immediately at my regiment, but the missiles passed a few feet too high to do injury. This march was continued to the distance of about a mile and a half through fields and dense woods, and most
