FORT SUMTER, June 20, 1864.

It occurs to me that I did not use sufficiently strong terms in my last report in speaking of the exceeding gallantry of the me who replaced the flag to-day; it took some time to accomplish, under a rapid fire, and at the most imminent personal risk. If, as usual, it be intended to notice the act in the papers, please have stronger terms of praise used than in my previous report.
