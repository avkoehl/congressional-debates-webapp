would have a powerful effect both by inspiring our men and disheartening the enemy. If you will get upon the field, leaving all your baggage on the east bank of the river, it will be a move to our advantage, and possibly save the day to us. The rebel force is estimated at over 100,000 men. My headquarters will be in the log building on top of the hill, where you will be furnished a staff officer to guide you to your place on the field.*

The great fatigue of our men, they having been engaged in two days' fight, or subject to a march yesterday and fight to-day, would preclude the idea of making any advance to-night without the arrival of the expected re-enforcements.
