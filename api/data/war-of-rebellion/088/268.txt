There has been a requisition made for 500 horses for the Second Cavalry Division. There are now at Washington about 1,000 men of this division dismounted. Ask Gregg if he will have 500 men sent with the horses or if he will have the horses sent and leave the men until they can be remounted. It is reported that the mail steamer has been fired into below here. Get a brigade of Greeg's cavalry ready, if you the matter and inform; in the meantime have the cavalry ready, but do not start them until further orders.
