Memphis, Tenn., December 30, 1864.

Colonel B. DORNBLASER,

Commanding at Germantown:

You will hold your whole command in readiness to move at an early hour to-morrow morning, the 31st instant. The infantry will be moved in by rail. If there are any wagons with your own or Colonel Kent's command have them collected at Germantown at an early hour to-morrow morning; also all private horses, as both will be moved in with the batteries, with which you will send a guard of a regiment of infantry. I will send a staff officer with the train in the morning, who will communicate any further instructions I may have.

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., December 30, 1864.

Major General S. R. CURTIS:

I got communication from Fayetteville last night. The troops are still there under marching orders, but do not know when they will leave.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, December 30, 1864-4 p. m.

General DODGE:

I also have information from General Thayer that Fort Smith will be evacuated next Saturday. Fort Scott and Cassville will then become the main outposts to watch the river and mountain passes near Fort Smith. Fort Gibson is an out-of-the-way affair that will also probably fall back during the winter, but this is not certain. The country is so destitute no rebel force can come through during winter.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.

PAOLA, December 30, 1864-12.30 p. m.

Major-General CURTIS:

Has General Lane arrived in Leavenworth?

JAS. G. BLUNT,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, December 30, 1864.

Major-General BLUNT, Paola:

Dispatch received. General Lane has not arrived. He is expected daily. I wish you would rescind that order, 38, concerning the issue of public stores to citizens for want of authority of law or regulations. Such an order will lead to a general rush on our commissary throughout the whole department and create expectations which we cannot satisfy without injustice to Government.

S. R. CURTIS,

Major-General.
