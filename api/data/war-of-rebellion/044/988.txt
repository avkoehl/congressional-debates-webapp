it impossible to proceed farther, and there being much danger, if the rain continued, that the bridge over Gardner's Creek might be washed away, I concluded to return to Jamesville before the passage was made impracticable, which was done during a most appalling thunderstorm. On arriving at the bridge, I found that my apprehension had been well founded, for in a few hours later a passage would have been impossible. The country was in great alarm at our approach, and I am confident that no troops have been sent away, as they expected to be attacked by my command at Rainbow Bluff. After resting the troops, who had on Monday made a long and fatiguing march, I returned safely to this place on the evening of the 28th, encountering on the way another furious storm.

All of which is respectfully submitted.
