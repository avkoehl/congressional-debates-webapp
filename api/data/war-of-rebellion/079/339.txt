WHITESIDE'S, October 17, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

A corporal who had a patrol of five men on the Trenton road last night reports that a citizen whom he met during the night told him that he had information that the rebel army was in the vicinity of Ringgold yesterday, and that they were marching toward the north. I send you this for what it is worth and will send out and find the citizen, if possible, who gave such information. The corporal should have brought him in to camp.

Colonel, &amp;c.

Their orders were to go on till they found the enemy or the road by which they are moving, and then to report to you at Chattanooga and to myself at this place. I sent 100 men to Bridgeport to report to General Wagner; a few minutes ago he telegraphed for another 100. I have none to send but the broken-down men and horses just from the scout to Van Buren, 130 miles. Shall I send them? Answer.
