HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,In the Field, August 23, 1864-3 p.m.

Lieutenant Colonel F. T. LOCKE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

I reported to General Miles; he assigned me to duty. I proceeded up the Burt [Vaughan?] road, and when opposite Reams' Station, on the right, encountered Hampton's cavalry; hard fight; the enemy were ten times my number. I fought them one hour. Sent for re-enforcements; could get none. Hampton's division had just arrived to join Lee. My loss is 8 killed, 32 wounded; Captain Sargent killed. I left dead on the field 184 rebels. I hold my own; have sent to General Gregg for help. He returned me word he had nothing to do with me. I then sent to General Miles; he sent me word he could give me but 100 men. The enemy are in strong force on my left. I can do great execution and rout them if I have one or two regiments of infantry. No one seems to assist me; can I not get it from General Warren? I am very peculiarly placed. My men are exhausted, but will protect General Warren's left at all hazards. Where Generals Gregg and Miles have gone there is no enemy, but on my front is the force above stated.

I am, with high respect, your obedient servant,

S. P. SPEAR,

Colonel, Commanding Cavalry.

Major-General HANCOCK:

You did not send Warren's reply to Colonel Spear's report. I should like to see it. I desire you to call on Generals Gregg and Miles for an explanation of the charge made by Colonel Spear, that they declined to send him assistance when he asked for it.

Colonel SPEAR,Commanding Cavalry:

COLONEL: Major-General Warren directs me to say that you are so far off that he will be unable to send you infantry from his command. If you cannot hold your own, you will have to fall back on General Miles.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

FRED. T. LOCKE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.
