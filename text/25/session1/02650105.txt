the count)y The disgraceful and extraoidmary
avidity w itti w nich disasters of that kind had been
trump-ted to the world, by alarga poiuon ol the
opposition pic-s m this country, olten magnified
greatly be^o id what in reality they were, afforded
a melancholy example of the reck'ess spirit of par-
ty, wh ch had proved ibelf but too ready to sacri-
fice commerce, ciedit, country, and every thing
that was sacred, to the advancement of factious
purposes
There was another crou nstance, w inch he had
often seen stated in the publications ot the day,and
whicn lernained uncontradicted, So far as he knew,
tial, of itself, and in itse!i, furnished the most ir-
relragable proof of the undue extensioa ot the pa-
p~i system in England, and that a spirit ofwld
speculation had been abroad there as well as on
this side of the Atlintic Many of her great bank-
ing houses connected with the American tiade, aie
said to have actually despatched agents to the large
commeicial cities of this country, for the purpose
ot offenng the most extended credit facilities to oui
merchants It was in this way, that man} who
but a little while before were cleiks, wuhout
either the capital or experience necessary to con-
duct large mercantile opeiations, were suddenly
converte J inta great importing merchants, and
having f ule l fui millions, the consequence's of
the ro\n imprudence were now to be chaiged to
the policy oi tne atministation It was this sti-
mulus to oyeitrading, which had been turmshed by
the great exp msion of ih papei svstem in that
countn , un ted with the same cause here, that had
proved ) disastrous to the inci chants of oui lai^e
citi s 1 ip veiy excitement which had chaiacter-
ízcd it, in England as well as in ^mei ca c eiilv

4.sto the slcohI issue which tne gentleman from
G i i'li ^(V up witl iht Pi idt it, .o piL-
cise data had been iurmshed to the countiv by
which it could accurately be decided. The Presi-
dent, in his, Message, estimates the amount of
debtowmg in Europe, from our citizens, on the
first of March last, at about trrtrtv millions.
The gentleman from Georgia thinks it much
larger, and undertakes to prove it, by adding to
what he supposes to be the mercantile debt, all the
loans vv hich have been negotiated m Europe, by
banks raihoad compames, and other corporations in.
his country The President surel} had nen er in-
tended to coiiT-irehend, in his estimate all the debts
and loans contrac ed ai Luiope b\ corporations,
some of which were payable not untrl many years
hence On the contiarv, ht speaks of the debts
w hich had been contiacted by our "citizens,' thus
obviously alluding to the mercantile debts due by
ind vidiials, as distinguished from those contracted by
coiporaltons As he had already remaiktd, we had no
means of aimín  at cerUnty in estimating the
foieign mercantile d bt He had, honever,§undci-
siood that the best informed merchants had siip
pose 1 it not to have exceeded the sumofthnty
midic is on the first of March last Its lapid 1 qui-
dititn, as is pinven by the gieat fall in the pie-
mium on bil s of exchange on England, goes great-
ly to favoi th  supposition that it had not exceeded
tkat ai onnt, or otherwise it could not have been
so much íe uctd n so short a dme
The "cntlem o 'inm Georgia attr butes much of
ti e disaster whicn nis fahen on the nation, in its
penman affairs, to the po'icy of the late Presi-
lent in'elation to the n-itional bank, and thinks
♦hat what he has been pleased to call "glory," is
maiapil tatecf deprecation Mr B wasneither
an admirer of wn<it was called national gloiy noi
of individual gloi\ If, nowevei, it was meant to
convey tie idea that the distinguished individual
who had late]} letned from the station oi Chief
Magistrate of this nation to puvate life no longer
enjoyed that exalted eminence in public esteem
which ne had before occupied a* a patriot states-
man h Jeggecl permission to d ffer ftom him In
the s ngle act which the gentleman from Georgia
had omrj aired of, the late President had done
enough to entitle him to imperishab'e fame, and to
hand his name down io futuie ages as one of the
great benefactors of mankind In adding his huiri-
bh testimony to the eminent public service^ of the
late Piesident, he  was the more gratified to do so
as it was a just tribute due to an individual now no
longei m the possession of official station, but in
the unostentatious retiiement of pnvate life
He could not concui with those who sought a so-
lution of the causes winch had brought about the
present commeicial distress and embarrassment of
the country in the policy of the late administration
Cause did not more certain!} produce effect than
did the piper s}stem occasional levulsions in
trade and oommcice, whether it existed  n thtfoim
of a national bank oi of ¡stale institutions This was
undeniably piov en by parallel cases of distress,
which had occuned in this country during the ex-
istence of the late national bank, and which had
repeatedly occuned in England Willi a similar in-
stitution But, besides the oidmaiv ten lencv of
that system to visit on lh  country occasional pecu-
niary distress, he saw, m the violent polracal war-
faie which the United Stales Bank and its indefa-
tigable partisans had waged against the part} m
power lor the last ft e or sue veais, many of the
causes which had led to the present state ol things,
and whicn the leal perpetratois, with characteristic
dextentv, weie nov< endeavoring to charge to the
policy of the late and present administrations
The pi unary causes which had led to this catas
trophe, in his opinion, were not of recent date, but
had their origin some (i vt or six ) ears back They
originated in that lapid succession of expansions
and contractions lesorted to by the United States
Baik when it was seeking to effect a lechartei
Thi'hist r} ot no similai institution in thewoild
had been Tiaik d by so mvnv and such sud-
den fluctúa' nis in its management Unless all

is to be i pudiatcd as untiue, th s couise of itself
was sum i itttsue in impulse to that sp rit of
speca all in, \hüí n iscd into action th a, has
since spread far and wide ovei the countty
Among the most effectual of these expansions
by the Bank of the United States m doing mis-
chief, was that in the latter part of the year 1834,
and in the beginning of that of 1835, by wmch
it increased its discounts, m the course of a few
months, from about forty-five millions of dollars
to about sixt}-five mill ons It would be borne in
mmd, that this enormous mciease took place some
time afict the lemoval of the public deposites from
that institution, and after the S ate banks, strength-
ened b> recen mg theui had fitted the vacuum m

Besides he would ask what p«nod has th ie been,
since tnat time, 'hat tne conn i { has enjrved le-

acted with it, on the financial policy of the Govern-

therefore, now to be toierattd, that the peipetratois
of so much of this mischief are to escape,- b}

lic mteligence was fully competent to understand

Ttiey had heard much of repioach and vitu-
peration cast on the administration for having, as
was alleged, failed to present some plan by which
to relieve the couutry of Us embarrassments Did
gentlemen suppose, when they seemed to consider
Congress so entirely competent to relieve tne coun-
try from its embarrassments, that it would piy the
debts of those lino1 ved, and res'ore the losses of

tion, had been piesentedfor fheirconsideration,and
had received the sanction of that body.
Was the bdl which extended a very liberal in-
dulgence to the meichants on a large amountiof
debt due to the Government, a measure bringing
ns relief Was the bill granting farther time to
the banks to pay over the Government «leposites,
and which would enable them to pxtend ¡uwre
leni'v to their debtors, of no value to the communi-
ty1 Would the bill which proposed the issuing
ol ten millions of Treasury notes, rendered neces-
sary by the indulgence extended to the meichants
and deposite banks, pioduce no beneficial effect?
The veiy anticipa'ion of tne passage of these mea-
suies, and of the latter more especially, it was said,
had ahead}, in conjunction with other causes, pro-
duced 'favorable influence on the money mirket
in the large cities II geut'emen m opposition,
who had presented such exaggerated pictures of
distiess, knew of other and belter remedtts than those
already proposed, and did not bring them forward,
the counfy would hold them answeiable for a de-
reliction of public djity The phjsiuan who stood
by and witnessed the agonies of the patient, «nd
who knew the remedy, and yet would not apply it,
w is guilty ol culpable negligence A national
bank, though not opealy avowed as such, is,lio
doubt, in the esti nation of gentlemen, the sove-
íeign cure for the distresses of the times. Why,
then, is it not proposed1 Wherefore i& there dsiay

Having, said Mr B replied to some remarks of
honorable gentlemen which he considered of a
character lequinng especial notice, íe would now
present some of the principal considerations which
had induced him to give the bill then before thein,
and the amendment proposed by the Seaator from
South Carolina, (Mr Calhoun,) his cordial sanc-
tion and support The same considerations of
wisdom and of common prudence which would
írduce an individual to change an agent in whom
he ha 1 tcposed a tru t, anl who had proved un-
faithful or incompetent, should admonish us, in our
public capacity, to withdraw our confidence from
those fiscal agents o the Government who had so
signallv failed in performing the duiies undertaken
bj them The State banks ha I been tried as fiscal
agents of the Gove-nment, undu ciicumstanaes the
mo tfavoiahle to success The nation hadreen,
w th astonishment, in a period of profound peate,
with no public debt burthenmg our resources and
with a Tieasury abouidmg m means be}oad all
former example, tne Government of the United
States sudden ij. deprived o the meaas to cany on
i ■> ordinary operati ns, by the determination of the
banks having possesion of itsievenues to suspend
specie pavmeuts "W as it thenart of wisdom, under
suchcircunst nc~s, to renew the coinection be-
tween the Govern uent and ihe banks1 Was it
proper for those cnti usted with the duty of conduct-
ing public affairs, aga n to subject 'he Government
to the lecurrence of the same evil, with, perhaps,
still more aggravated injure
Foi one, he w isned to see tne FedeiM Govern-
m"nt taken out ot the keep ng of irresponsible
banking corpoiatio s, and subject to be controlled
alone by the w ill of the people, its only legitimate
master- So long as ban«s weie made the deposi-
tones of the public íevenue, the Government was
dependent on them m conducting its most i aipor-
tant oeration-., ether in peace or in war Its
action mignt be arre ted by their withhdding its
means in p°nods of the greatest public emt gency
It coull not m war command a squadron to snl
or put a battalion in motion, if the banks enti usted
with its revenue should determirs to withho'd it.
Its veiy existence might be enuangered by being;
biought to a pans1 for the want ot means. The
reflection *a  humiliating   that a Government,
