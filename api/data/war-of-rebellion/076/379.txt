HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 5, 1864.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Palmer is developing his troops along the enemy's line, which is found to run nearly south from Hascall's right, and to be very strong. As soon as Palmer gets two divisions in position Johnson will make a rapid detour to the right, and try to strike the enemy in flank or in point of his line which is not held in force. Cox will take Johnson's place as reserve on the right, and if Johnson fail cox will assault immediately. This movement is to be made at 2 o'clock. I think we are progressing pretty well, though slowly. Have captured about 200 prisoners. General Howard asks me to inform you that his signal officer reports that a large column of cavalry is passing into Atlanta from the enemy's left, probably one brigade.

Major-General SHERMAN:

Your dispatch is received. The enemy appears to have a continuous line to our right, behind the Sandtown road, but I presume held only by cavalry. I will get that, and then try to break toward the railroad.

General SCHOFIELD:

One of my staff reports nothing done on that flank. Is possible you cannot move those troops? Let me know the truth, and, if necessary, I will withdraw them and substitute others.
