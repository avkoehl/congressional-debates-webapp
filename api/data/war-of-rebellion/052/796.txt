Brigadier-General GARFIELD:

GENERAL:

I am directed by Major-General McCook to state that he is desirous of having that interior line of rifle-pits, &amp;c., constructed, and that if an engineer officer can be sent to stake out the work, he will immediately furnish the detail to assist him, and he will employ his reserves on the work to-day as judiciously as possible, if a safe opportunity offers. Please inform General McCook whether the general commanding considers this course best under the circumstances. If he does, the work can be begun at once. General McCook has just gone to the front.

I have the honor to be, general, very respectfully,

G. P. THRUSTON,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
