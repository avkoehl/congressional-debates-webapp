GILES COURT-HOUSE, May 6, 1862.

Colonel HAYES:

Arrived here and took the place completely by surprise. No house burnt. Citizens all here. Large amount of commissary stores. Teams were engaged in hauling them away when we came. We have captured 1 major, 1 lieutenant-colonel, and 15 or 20 other prisoners. Completely successful so far, but need re-enforcements immediately, as the enemy is only ten miles distant with a considerable force. Send us some of the mounted rifles until you can come.

J. M. COMLY,

Major Twenty-third Regiment Ohio Volunteer Infantry.
