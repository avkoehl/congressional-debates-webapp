Immediately after the roll was called—
Mr. RANDOLPH of New Jersey rose and said:
the list of members having: been called, I hold in
my hand a paper, which 1 ask to be read by the
Clerk.
Mr. VANDERPOEL. I should like to know
what that paper is. I object to the reading of pa-
pers until we know what they are.
Mr. RANDOLPH. When it is read the gentle-
man wilt see what it is.
Mr. BYNUM. I object to its being read, became
I do not believe the rules of ihs Hon1* will sanc-
tion it.
Mr. WISE. It will be read merely for informa-
tion.
The CHAIR said that the paper would he read.
Mr. DROMGOOLE here endeavored to obtain the
floor.
Mr. FICKEN3 hoped the gentleman from New
Jersey would make a brief staiement of the contents
of the paper, so that the House may know what
it is.
Mr. RANDOLPH. If the Clkrk will hand me
back the paper 1 will read it myself. That w.U be
the best way to give gentlemen the information
ttey desire.
Mr. SMITH of Maine rese to a question of or-
der. Objection had been made lo the reading of
the paper, and it would now be for the House to
determine whether it should be read or not.
The CHAIR said the gentleman refused to make
a brief statement.
Mr. RANDOLPH rose to proceed with the read-
ing of the pawr.
Mr. SMITH said he did not know what the pa-
per was which the gentleman held h his hand; but
if it was prepared with a view of showing that
himself or other gentlemen were entitled to seats
here, he hoped the Clkrk would also be permitted
to read the paper which he had prepared on the
fame subject.
Mr. WISE. Certainly gentlemen do not forget
that tbe gentleman from Ohio [Mr. Duncan] was
permitted lo read, and have read, papers, as a part
of his speech, and why do they object to the read-
ing of this paper, merely as a matter of infor-
mation?
[Many voices—"Go on," "go on."]
Mr. RANDOLPH then read a lengihy paper,
signed by Messrs. Aycriog, Halsted, Maxwkli,
Stiutton, and Yorke, protesting against the ac-
tion of the House, by which thty were excluded
from voting on questions previous to an examina-
tion of their case, and concluded by moving that
the protest be entered on the journal of the House.
Mr. DYNUM said he protested against the en-
tering of this protest on the journal of the House;
and he though the House owed it to its own dignity
to pass a vote of censure upon the gentleman from
New Jersey, for offering this direct insult to the
members of this body. It was contrary to all the
rules and usages of the House for persons to come
here and offer objectionable andinsulttng language
to the House, who have no connection with it.
They do not belong to this House, and hive no
more right to enter a protest on the journal of this
House, than inhabitants of Great Britain. What,
sir, is the character of that papei? It is nothing
but the ebullitions of disappointed ambition, coming
from men who have been excluded from this
House, and prevented from practising an imposi-
tion on the free people of the State of New Jersey.
A protest, indeed! Why, sir, members of this
House alone have, the right to have a protest en-
tere I upon your journal; and the signers of this
protest, as they call it, are not members of the body.
Then, instead of receiving or countenancing this
paper, which has been read by the gentleman, he
deserves the censure of the Hou«e, if not expulsion
from the floor. [Laughter.] The gentleman can-
not be looked upon as a member of the House; and
if the House was properly organized, he would de-
serve the censure of the body for the course he has
pursued. The gentleman was conscious, when he
first presented this paper, that it contained objec-
tionable matter, and hence it was that he endea-
vored to shrink from responsibility, by declining to
make a brief statement of its contents, and sending
it up to the Clerk's table to be read. He hoped
that the pap^r would be returned to the member
from New Jersey, as the attempt to have it entere 1
on the journal was entirely out of order. The
member had no nsht to make the motion, and the
Chair had no right tn entettatn it. If he under-
stood the course of proceeding last night, the Chair
had decided that no motion was in ore'er but a mo-
tion to adjourn. Now, however, it was perrect!y
in order Icr a member to get up and presen* a pe-
tition, called a pro'e-t, of men, aliens as it were in
this House, who had no right on this floor, and
who had been voted again and again out of this
House. He hiped th.'.t th"3 protect, as it wasea'l-
ed, would receive no countenance fiom this
House. Contrast the conduct cf tve^e men,
who have attempted to present this paper,
with the conduct of the Democratic memhe-s,
who have been excluded. Trie Democratic
members who have been excluded, act the part of
gentlemen, and men of honor, disponed to yield to
the solemn decisions of the House, when they are
once made. Their conduct is a commentary upon
the conduct of their opponents, and ouaht to be so
considered, and will be so considered, by the free-
men of the State oí New Jersjy. There has been
no disposition, on the part of the Democratic mem-
bers who have been excluded, to thrust themselves
into the House. They have exhibited'a disposi-
tion to yield to the decisions of the majority of the
House, as they know they were sent here by a
majority of the people. The members en the other
side who have bsen excluded, are endeavoring to
thrust themselves into the House, notwithstanding
they have been voted out again and again.
[Laughter] Gentlemen may lau¿h, but they can-
not laugh truth inio falsehood.
Mr. DROMGOOLE here attempted to obtain
the floor.
Mr. MERCER. I rise to move the previous
question, and on. that motion I call the yeas «ad
nays,
Mr. DROMGOOLE. I rise to a question of
order.
The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his
point of order.
Mr. DROOMGOOLE. My point of order is this:
that the gentleman from New Jersey, had no right
to spread this protest on the journal, and that the
Chairman had no right to receive it, after its re-
ception had been objected to, and *pi ead it before
the House, until the House had first decided, by a
vote of tbe House that it should be received.
The CHAIR considered that the paper had been
received when first presented.
Mr. DROOMGOOLE sa'd he did not de-ire to
do any thing unfair. When the House should, at
the proper time, proceed to the decision of the New
Jersey case, no man would be more ready to afford
to both parlies a full and fair hearing.
Mr. WISE would ask h.s colleague, whether,
after the withdrawal of the motion of the gentleman
from South Carolina, any gentleman had not a
right to make any motion pertaining to a settle-
ment of thisqnestion.
The CHAIR said a point of order was made, a^
to whether the Chairman hart a right to propound
to the House the motion of the gentleman from
New Jersey, before the House had received the
piper presented by the gentleman. The Chair con-
si Ice i that the paper was received and read by
consent of the Hou-e; and after it was read, the
gentleman moved that it be entered on the journal.
Mr. VANDERPOEL. It will be recollected
that I stated expressly that I objected to its being
received and read.
Mr. WISE would say a word with regard to the
reception of this paper. The gentleman might
have arisen and said, "I move to present a paper,
and have it recorded"—that is a presentation, and
having presented it in this way, he had a right to
have it read. The Chair, therefore, could not
prevent its being read, and he was bound, by the
law of order, to receive it.
The previous question was then seconded—ayes
107, noes 87, and the main question ordered to be
put.
Mr. WISE called for the yeas and nays on th
main question, which were ordered.
Mr. VANDERPOEL rose to a question of or-
der. [Loud cries of "order! ordir!"] My ques-
tion ot order i-, thii: Whether, by calling the yeas
an I nays, we do not, from necessity, spread this
paper on the journal?
Mr. WISE.    Certainly, sir.
The question was then taken on the mo ion to
enter the protest on the journal, and decided in the
negative—yeas 114, nays 117, as follow*:
