396-
TB?E CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
August 2,
Mr. COLLAMER. But part of it.
Mr. GRIMES. A large part of it was never
under consideration here at all. >
Mr. SIMMONS. All I can say is, we found
it on the table of the committee printed, every
part of it, and X suppose it is as accessible to every
other Senator as it is to the members of that com-
mittee.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. Does the Sen-
ator from Iowa move that the bill be printed?
Several Senators. Oh, no !
Mr. GRIMES. I do not make such a motion;
but I desire to say I shall vote against any bill of
such consequence as this, if I must vote without
having an opportunity to read it. I understand
it imposes direct taxation,and contains an income
law, and affects the finances of the country very
materially; and I cannot be expected to vote for
such a proposition as that without having an
opportunity to examine it.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Well, sir, I think itmay
be as well in that case, for I really do not want
Senators to say they vote against this bill because
they have had.no opportunity to understand it,
although this matter is pressing, and although the
bill has been laid on our tables for four or five
days; yet, if the Senator wants more time, and
predicates his vote upon that, I am willing that it
shall be deferred until to-morrow, to give him an
opportunity to understand it.
Mr. SIMMONS. I should like to accommo-
date the Senator very much; but this bill has been
printed'.
Mr. FESSENDEN. It is only a question
whether we shall raise money or not; whether we
can carry on the war.
Mr. COLLAMER. I wish to add a word. The
part of the bill which the gentleman from Iowa
seems to think has not been considered in this
body, that which relates to the real estate tax,
has been printed, and we have had it before us,
although it has not been considered. It was re-
ferred to the Committee on Finance after it came
from the House, but has not been considered in
this body. But I wish to say, sir, that this bill
is essentially the same as the act which has been
passed four or five times in the history of this
Government. It was drawn originally, I believe,
by Mr. Gallatin and Mr. Hamilton, 111 1794. It
was passed again in 1813and 1814and 1815. There
is nothing in it, as I understand it, but what has
been the tried law of this Government ever since
, the beginningoftheGovernmcnt. Theonlyques-
tion is whether we are to lay a direct tax at all,
and apportion it among the States, according to
the Constitution.
Now, sir, there is nothing in that bill which
would require its postponement, in order that, gen-
tlemen may consider it. Its details are all those
which experience has tested. They are long, it
is true; but I believe they are essentially the same
with those of previous bills. The whole question
is, whether we will sustain this measure of a di-
rect tax; and that we can discuss just as well
without reading over the details of the bill, or
having it printed over again.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I will add, in regard to
the question to print, that this tax bill was origm-
nally proposed in the House, and when proposed
they printed it, and sent it here; and it was laid on
our tables ten days or a fortnight ago. Again,
jjvhen it was passed m the House, as amended
. "-with the income and other taxes in it, it was sent
I here, and on my motion, four or five days ago,
' that was printed and laid on our tables again; so
that the whole measure has been before the Sen-
ate for a long time in printed shape. It is a sim-
ple question, as the Senator from Vermont says,
whether we shall lay a direct tax of ยง20,000,000;
that is the amount of it. I will only say to Sen-
ators in regard to it, that I want it understood by
every one; no one shall say or feel he has not had
an opportunity to examine it; but I am satisfied
that on the question, whether wo pass this bill or
not, depends the question whether we can obtain
any money to carry on the Government. I have
it from the most reliable sources, that unless this
provision is made for the payment of the interest
which will accrue upon the loan we have author-
ized; unless we come to it, and our constituents
come to it, we may as well give up the idea of
attempting to obtain the loan that is absolutely
necessary at the present time. It is useless for
Scaatoi .s to talk about eariying oil the war, and
all that, unless they can come up to the measures
absolutely necessary to provide that which is the
foundation,*at all times, of the material of war.
Mr. SIMMONS. I suppose it maybe proper
to read the bill through; but I am perfectly satis-
fied, and I think all Senators ought to be satisfied,
that they have had a fair opportunity to read it
for themselves. I will now explain to the Senate
the modifications and alterations made in the bill
in the committee of conference and the reasons
for them; and I will state them as briefly as I
can.
I suppose there can be no apology for any Sen-
ator not having read the bill as it passed the Sen-
ate, if it has not been read; and I do not suppose
it has been read any more than the bill from the
House. I have never read it anymore. We have
stricken out of the Senate substitute, raising reve-
nue from imports, the lOper cent.additional duty.
At the same time, we have raised, considerably
higher than the Senate bill proposed, the duties
on brandies and spirits. We have, in fact, im-
posed an additional duty on the mischievous lux-
uries, the strong drinks, and we have omitted to
place upon the geneial consumption of the coun-
try this 10 per cent., and then we have provided
all the drawbacks for transportation and every-
thing of that sort. .
โข'""Then again, we have reduced the income tax
on the highest scale from 7| to 5 per cent. The
schedule of 5 per cent., which embraced most
of the incomes, we put at 3; and on that por-
tion of an income which is derived from interest
from Government securities, we put 1| per cent.
That will probably reduce the receipts from this
tax from incomes, $10,000,000. It was called
$30,000,000 originally, and I think it will be so
very nearly now. That-is a mere matter of con-
jecture.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I ask the Senator to give
way for a moment. I wish to make a "privileged
motion, and have it entered.
Mr. SIMMONS. This happens to be one; but
I will give way, if it is only for a motion
TUB NATIONAL LOAN.
Mr. TRUMBULL. A bill passed yesterday,
on the report of the committee af conference, en-
titled " An act supplementary to the ' Act to au-
thorize a national loan and for other purposes,' "
one of the sections of which repeals the sub-Treas-
ury law in part, and authorizes a deposit m any
specie-paying bank of Government money. I
was not aware, when itpassed,of that provision.
I move now to reconsider the vote of the Senate
agreeing to that report.
Mr. FESSENDEN. If that motion is made,
I want it put now, and have it settled at once. 1
will say to the Senate that that section to which
the Senator alludes goes justso far as this: in the
present condition of the country, we have to rely,
in a very great degree, on the banks, on the mon-
eyed men of the country, for money; and if we
insist upon retaining the law in its present con-
dition, the banks, which must have, by the laws
of the States, a certain quantity of specie in their
vaults, to do their business and accommodate their
customers, cannot do what they are disposed to
do, and that is, to take largely, if these bills are
passed, of the Government loan, and aid the Gov-
ernment m everg way they can by money; be-
cause, if the law stands as it is at present, they
are obliged to take the specie out of their vaults
in order to do it. If, however, you allow them,
in the present state of the country, to become de-
positories, which is only another mode of letting
the specie remain there, and take their bills, then
they are ready to accomplish both purposes. It
is thought to be exceedingly necessary and wise
to have this provision; and every business man
acquainted with banks and their operations will
see its necessity under the laws of the States; and
I cannot conceive, for this temporary purpose,
any objection whatever to it. Thatis the opinion
of the Secretary of the Treasury, and the opinion
of the committees of both Houses, that it is ex-
ceedingly necessary to be done. The difficulty
that arose before was, that they made this the
basis to make large discounts; but, in the present
condition of the country, the discounts are small
enough, at all events; and there is no danger
whatever of overtrading.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I do not ask the consid-
eration of the motion now.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I do, because it is neces-
sary.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I will merely ask that my
motion be entered.
Mr. FESSENDEN. I ask that it be consid-
ered now. It is absolutely necessary that that
bill should be disposed ofj to-day. It has already
been delayed too long, and we may as well settle
it at once.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I desire to enter the mo-
tion to reconsider the vote of the Senate concur-
ring in the report of the committee of conference
on that bill.
Mr. FESSENDEN. Well, sir, I insist on its
being taken up.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I have no objection to its
being takei#up, if the Senate desire it. I did not
wish to interfere with other business, and my
object was merely to have the motion entered, so
that it might be considered hereafter.
Mr. FESSENDEN. But the Senator in put-
ting in the motion, and having it continued, not
wishing to have action upon it, is just exactly
stopping all the operations of the Treasury with
regard to getting money, when a day is of infinite
consequence.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I do not wish to delay it.
I am willing to have it considered, if that is the
desire of the Senate.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Anthony
in the chair.) Is it the pleasure of the Senate to
take up the subject now? The Chair hears no
objection.
Mr. SIMMONS. The question is on recon-
sidering.
Mr. TRUMBULL. And on that question, if
we arc to consider it now, I will say a few words
to the Senate.
Mr. BRIGHT. If the Senator from Illinois
will allow me, I wish to ask, how does this ques-
tion get before the Senate and supersede the reg-
ular business ?
"The PRESIDING OFFICER. By the assent
of the Senator from Rhode Island.
Mr. BRIGHT. But before that, there was a
question"pending undisposed of.
Mr. FESSENDEN. The Senate by unan-
imous consent allowed this subject to be consid-
ered.
Mr. BRIGHT. I did not give consent.
Mr. FESSENDEN. You did not object.
Mr. BRIGHT. I do not wish to interfere with
the business of the body; on the contrary, I should
like to aid it, and will aid it; but this is an over-
riding of all rules to have three or four different
questions before the Senate at the same time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. It is not in
order to consider the motion to reconsider at the
present time, unless by unanimous consent. There
appeared to be unanimous consent a moment ago,
when the Chair put the question.
Mr. BRIGHT. I understand from the Sen-
ator from Illinois that the bill we have passed
repeals the sub-Treasury act.
Mr. TRUMBULL. In part.
Mr. BRIGHT. I understand the Senator from
Maine admits that such is the fact.
Mr. FESSENDEN. No, sir; I say it suspends
the operation of part of it for a short time.
Mr. BRIGHT. I apprehend, if the Senate
generally understood that they were passing a bill
repealing the sub-Treasury act, it would have re-
ceived much more attention and consideration than
it did. That, sir, is one of the fundamental prin-
ciples on which this Government rests at this
time. It is one of the great political issues that
from time to time have engaged the attention of
parties, and put them out and brought them into
power. I am quite sure I should not have con-
sented, for One, to the passage of any act that,
looked to the repeal of any feature of the sub-
Treasury act. It is too important a question to
be disposed of in this way. If the Senator from
Illinois proposes to do that, of course it will take
a great deal of time.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I propose to reconsider
the bill repealing that act. It passed without
observation.
Mr. BRIGHT. There is no objection to enter-
ing the motion.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Thatis what I have done.
Mr. BRIGHT. Some of us, however, would
like to vote on the proposition pending, which is
the business of the morning, the joint resolution
