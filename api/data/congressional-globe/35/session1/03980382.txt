APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[May 24,
35th Cong....1st Sess.
Fifteen Million Loan—Mr. Wilson.
Senate.
revenue, estimated that the receipts for the residue
of the year would be equal to the demands for
the year; and that he would have a balance in the
Treasury, on the 1st of July, of $426,000. Now,
the Secretary comes here, on the 19th of May,
with a report asking for a loan of '$15,000,000 to
meet the expenditures of the first two quarters of
the next fiscal year. He says in this report that
the revenue has not equaled his estimates by
$10,000,000, and that Congress has appropriated
$10,000,000beyondhisestimates. There was not,
I take it, a man in the Senate or the country fa-
miliar with the condition of the country and the
financial condition of the Government, who did
not know that the Secretary of the Treasury had
overestimated the receipts by at least ten mil-
lion dollars. It was declared on this floor, and on
the floor of the other House, that the estimates
were all overdrawn by from ten to twelve million
dollars. I think it now turns out to be about
twelve million dollars. Now, the Secretary un-
dertakes to put the responsibility on Congress of
having appropriated $10,000,00(3 more than was
asked for by the Departments. We all know that
the deficiency bill, which passed here, was an Ad-
ministration measure; that it came here by the
sanction of the Executive; that it was assumed
and carried through as an Administration meas-
ure, and the executive department should share
its full and equal responsibility for its passage. 1
do not like, Mr. President, this attempt of the
Secretary of the Treasury to shirk the respons-
ibility, and to throw the blame upon Congress
for having thrust upon him an expenditure of
$10,000,000 unasked. It was not in the regular
estimates, it is true, but it was asked for; it was
demanded by the Administration; and those of us
here who interposed obstacles to its passage were
denounced in the official journal and by the Ad-
ministration presses of the country. Sir, the defi-
ciency bill was emphatically an Administration
measure, and I hold the Administration to its re-
sponsibility, nut only for the passage of tin- bill,
but for the use of the money.
The fiscal year is nearly closed; and the Sec-
retary tells us, in this late report, that by the
commencement of the next fiscal year the Treas-
ury notes will be exhausted. So mueh for the
Secretary's estimates—a mistake in his estimates
which, in five months, amounts to $90,000,000.
Nobody is surprised at it. We were only sur-
prised and astonished that the Secretary of the
Treasury, occupying the position lie occupied,
should ever have indulged in .stu.li wild calcula-
tions—could ever have made and published such
estimates. The Secretary made his estimates for
next year; and he is far wilder in them than he
was in his estimates for the present year, lie
estimates the dutiable imports lor the next yearat
$371,000,0110—$1)0,000,000 more of dutiable im-
ports than were over imported into the United
States in one year. I read this estimate m Ins an-
nual report with utter amazement. Why, sir, if
you look at the imports during the adminiNtiation
of President Pierce, they amount, dutin<> his four
years, to $3,14G,000,000—an average of $"JH(i,000,-
000 per annum. Prom this you mast deduct the
articles on the free list, an average of twenty-five or
thirty millions annually during that Adminis-
tration; leaving less than two hundred and sixty
million dollars of dutiable articles annually im-
ported during the four prosperous commercial
years of President Pierce's administration. The
dutiable imports this year amount to about two
hundred and ten million dollars, nearly one half
of which were imported the first quarter of the
year. The Secretary told us, in his annual re-
port, that they would amount to $'20*2,000,000.
They actually amount to about two hundred and
ten million, being ^50,000,000 loss than he esti-
mated last December. If we should import next
year as much as we imported in 1856-57—which
would be about two hundred and sixty-two mil-
lion dollars of dutiable articles—we should go be-
yond the justexpectations of any reasonable man
in America. There is not a statesman here; there
is not a merchant in the United States; there is
not a practical business man in this country, fa-
miliar with the commercial condition of the coun-
try, who believes the imports, from the 1st of
July next to the 1st of July, 1859, will equal the
imports from the 1st of July, 1856, to the 1st of
July, 1857—the largest year of importation the
country ever witnessed.
Next year, Mr. President, you will not only
not have §371,000,000 of dutiable imports, but you
will not have $250,000,000. The largest imports
we ever had were $280,000,000 of dutiable im-
ports. Those articles, if they should come in next
year in as large quantities as they did m 1856 and
1857, will be reduced in value about sixty million
dollars, so that you cannot, by any possibility,
have more than $250,000,000 of dutiable articles
during the next year, on which you will raise not
more than forty-seven or forty-eight million dol-
lars. The Senator from Virginia [Mr. Hunter]
estimates the receipts from customs next year at
$52,000,000. I think he will find, when next year
closes, that he has made a mistake of from five to
seven million dollars in that estimate. He also
estimates that we are to receive $10,000,000 from
the sale of the public lands. Why, sir, the average
land receipts for the last four or five years are
only about five million dollars. It is true, lands
are opened in California, and we may have a larfre
increase, but your whole revenue next year will
not exceed $55,000,000, and it is more likely to
be less than that amount. I think it may be, alto-
gether, about what the Senator estimates the re-
ceipts from customs to be—$52,000,000.
Now, let us see where we are. We have this
year used up the $18,000,000 of surplus in the
Treasury with which wo commenced the year; we
have raised $44,000,000, and we have borrowed
$30,000,000, making a total of $82,000,000, all of
which we have spent. We commence the 1st of
July next, according to the admissions of the
Secretary of the Treasury, without any money
m the Treasury, lie estimates in his annual re-
port, that we are to have imports to the extent of
$371,000,000 next year, and that we are to raise
upon those imports$69,500,000, and receive from
public lands $5,000,000, and from all sources to-
gether, $75,000,000; and he estimates the ex-
pendituieft at $75,000,000. He will fall short of
his revenue from customs the cominir vear more
than twenty million dollars Instead of receiving
seventy-five millions in revenue, his receipts will
not go beyond fifty-five millions. What amount
have we to meet next year? The estimates of the
Department amount to $75,000,000, and if the
expenditures do not exceed that sum by addi-
tions made by Congress, you have to add to that
$20,000,000 of floating Treasury notes, which we
have to pay next year, amounting to $95,000,000.
I understand that propositions are before Congress
likely to pass, that will add several million dollars
to the expenditures. Suppose they be $80,000,000
—and I do not believe they will fall short of that
sum, for Congress will add four or five millions
to the estimates—and add to that $20,000,000 of
Treasury notes, and you have to provide for
$100,uu0,000 next year. There is $95,000,000 to
provide for, according to your own showing, and
at least $100,000,000 by all reasonable and proper
estimates. One hundred million dollars I One
hundred million dollars ! One hundred million
dollars to be paid during the next fiscal year I
To meet that vast sum, you have only a revenue,
from all sources, of from fifty to fifty-five mil-
lions; making a deficit of $45,000,000 for 1859.
Now, how are you to meet this $100,000,000?
The Secretary tells us he will have to pay
$37,000,000 in the first six months, and that the
income for the first half of the year will not be
$37,000,000, as estimated in Dcccmbcr last, but
$'25,000,000. He is getting to be a little rational
on this question of the receipts. He wants
$15,000,000 to carry the Government through the
first half of the next year—not the whole year.
Now, sir, these $15,000,000 will not carry him to
January next. Sir, I make the prediction here
now, and I wish Senators to remember the pre-
diction, that we shall be called upon when we
meet m December next to provide means to
carry the Government through December and
over the 1st of January. And this call will be
pressed upon us with all the power of immediate
and overwhelming necessity. Itis inevitable, on
the showing of the Treasury Department itself,
that the Government cannot go beyond the 1st of
January next, if it can go to that day, with the
aid of this $15,000,000 loan.
You hav« to provide for $100,000,000 next
year. You borrow $15,000,000; you raise from
all sources $55,000,000 of revenue, and to the
fullest extent that is all you will get. You will,
therefore, have $70,000,000 with which to
meet $100,000,000. You will have a deficit of
$30,000,000 next year. You are called upon, in
reality, to pay next year beyond your receipts,
$45,000,000, at the lowest possible estimate.
You may be called upon to pay fifty-five or sixty
million dollars; but it cannot be less than
$45,000,000. To meet that, you propose to raise
$15,000,000, for the first six months, calculating
to raise $25,000,000 from all sources, making
$40,000,000.
We shall have to meet $60,000,000 from Janu-
uary to July, and we shall have only twenty-five
or thirty million dollars to pay it with, thus leav-
ing a deficit of thirty million dollars for the last
two quarters of the fiscal year. To go through the
next fiscal year, the Government must incur a
permanent national debt of $40,000,000. How
do Senators like this flattering financial picture ?
It is a truthful statement of the condition of the
national Treasury; and I hope Senators will not
fail to sec where we are, and whither we are drift-
ing. No Administration can stand, or ought to
stand, that expends in two years $65,000,000 be-
yond its receipts. No Administration can stand,
or ought to stand, that plunges headong into ex-
travagant expenditures—expenditures which ex-
ceed by tens of millions its receipts. No Adminis-
tration can stand, or ought to stand, that resorts
to temporary expedients, or to national debts, to
meet its current expenses in times of peace.
Well, sir, what are your hopes for the future?
Does the Administration expect, can it expect,
has it a right to expect, that the Government can
raise money enough to meet its extravagant ex-
penditures under the present revenue system ?
The Secretary says our exports and imports
are increasing at the rate of ten per cent, per an-
num; and the honorable Senator from Virginia
has indulged to-day in these absurd estimates.
Let me tell the Administration and the Senator
that they will witness no such increase during the
next three years of their power. This increase
for the last four or five years has been an unnat-
ural and unhealthy increase. It was stimulated
by the expansions of bank paper, condemned by
your Executive and your Secretary of the Treas-
ury. It was stimulated by large purchases of
State and railway stocks in Europe. You cannot
keep up this expansion during the next three
years. We have had a reaction, a collapse; the
country has been brought back. Our articles
of exportation have fallen about twenty-five per
cent. The goods we import have gone down—
some of them, like sugar—forty or fifty per cent.
They have gone down, on the average, at least
thirty per cent., and the reduction of the prices of
your articles of export, and of your articles of
import, with the fact that we have $500,000,000
of State and railway stocks held abroad, imposes
upon the people the stern necessity to be econom-
ical in their expenditures. In the year ending
.Tune 30,1857, we imported $360,000,000, and ex-
ported $362,000,000, making $722,000,000 of im-
ports and exports. This year, our exports and
imports will not exceed five hundred and twenty-
two million dollars. Does any rational man be-
lieve that our imports and exports for the next
year will exceed the imports and exports in 1857 ?
Does any practical business man believe that the
value of our imports and exports will, for the
next three years of this Administration, exceed
in quantity and value the exports and imports of
the year ending June 30, 1857? In the present
condition of the country, in view of the reduced
value of merchandise, and the lessons of economy
taught by the experiences of the past year, we
have no right to expect that our imports and ex-
ports will exceed, during the next three years,
seven hundred and twenty-two millions annually.
Should our imports next year equal in value our
imports for 1857, at the present rates of duty, only
$50,000,000 of revenue will be realized from the
customs. At the present rates of duties, to raise
the $52,000,000 estimated by the honorable Sen-
ator from Virginia from the customs, we must
import $272,000,000 of dutiable merchandise,
which will be $10,000,000 more than we ever im-
ported, with the exception of 1857.
