NASHVILLE, TENN., November 4, 1864-8 p. m.

Colonel C. R. THOMPSON, Johnsonville:

Hold on to your position. I will send the Twenty-THIRD Corps, or a portion of it a least, to your assistance, either to-morrow or in the evening. You must not let the enemy have your position, but must hold on to it till re-enforcement reach you. If you think it necessary to have them answer immediately.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.

JOHNSONVILLE, November 4, 1864-6 p. m.

Captain A. H. PLUMMER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

Artillery firing has ceased. Lieutenant Commander Le Roy Fitch says he cannot get up with the fleet from below. The enemy has several 20-pounder Parrotts, not less than twenty guns in all. The firing supposed to be in the enemy's rear was, I think, fired by our skirmishers. Send ammunition for 10-pounder Parrotts and Napoleon guns, under strong guard. We must have ammunition to fight with. Have your orders to give, other than to fight? That I will do without orders.

CHAS. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel, &amp;c.

JOHNSONVILLE, November 4, 1864.

Captain A. H. PLUMMER,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General:

The gun-boats below have not passed the rebel battery. Lieutenant- Commander King had nineteen shots through his boat while engaging the battery. I send four 10-pounder Parrotts, with 500 infantry support, to Reynoldsburg to engage rebel battery. Am secure here.

Respectfully,

C. R. THOMPSON,

Colonel, Commanding.

NASHVILLE, TENN., November 4, 1864-11 p. m.

(Received 8th.)

Brigadier General M. L. SMITH, Memphis, Tenn.:

If you have any cavalry it would be well for you to send it out in the direction of Corinth to discover, if possible, whether the enemy is making any movements in that direction, as well as to threaten the destruction of the Mobile and Ohio Railroad.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.
