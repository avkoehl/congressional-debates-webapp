II. oí Reps.
smoately With their verdict I shall be content If they will
thai the pune and the sword shall remain m the hands of one
man, and that he shall control the legislation ol the couniiy, be
Uso But I have no feais of the ie=utt A people always
jealous o! then freedom nevei cao be slaves Our countrymen
are unfit f i bondage Ihey have been too long used toitisti
fuüonsof freedom Lei. tots q .^iiun gtlefoie them, and their
judgment will soon be foimed. Aheady then vn*te is heard The
£*orth, the Bast, and the gieat aidglouous West are beginning
to sp ak out Soon the South will come, and all, tallying un
der the standard of legislative and popular supremacy, will
still unite in the battle ciyofrefoim Tr>e people will muinph
--their voice will be heard—Executive power will be curtailed
—pationage will be shorn of i¡s "sword and cannon"—and the
ocean of paity, which now heaves up its mountain billows, will
subside into calmness and *ecunty In this conflict the country
expects 'every man to dolus duty n Let none shrink back
Let no Whig be found navetuneuch afight Though "win,
hisflig is yet flying " His countiy again calls him, befoie the
shouts of hia last victoiy luve died away Let him devote
himself to het cause 1 he spear oí Brutus is poised to strike
him to the ground Let him 'once more unto the breach,"
and all will yet be well—the Constitution safe—the voice of
the people supreme—the Laws secuie from violation—and the
proud legacy which out fatheisgave us unimpaired) for the
millions who will yet inhabit this "lard of the free, and home
