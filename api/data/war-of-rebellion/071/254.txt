Major-General WALLACE:

Steamer Portsmouth arrived from Baltimore. No further news. The following is from General Couch, at Philadelphia:

I am glad to hear you are presenting, for the present, General Wallace; say so to the general. Anything I can do shall be done readily. Please keep me informed of military matters in your vicinity.

D. N. COUCH,

Major-General.

By to-morrow noon I shall so far have completed arrangements here as to be easily spared further delay here if you will recall me.

Major-General WALLACE:

General Couch telegraphs from Philadelphia that the enemy are about making a demonstration against Conowingo bridge, twelve miles above this, and at Peach Bottom, some few miles above that again. I sent 100 men to the first-named place this afternoon and have ordered 100 men to go to the ford above. Will send a smooth-bore 12-pounder to the bridge. General Couch's order is to tear up the bridge if possible. General Dix telegraphs he will order Colonel Serrell, of Volunteer Engineers, and Lieutenant Andrews, U. S. Artillery, to report to Major-General Wallace. I await orders.
