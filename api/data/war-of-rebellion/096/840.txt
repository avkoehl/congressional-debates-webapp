HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, March 4, 1865.

General S. S. CARROLL, Cumberland:

The general wants you to get as accurate and detailed information by means of scouts or otherwise as possible of the location and strength of parties of the enemy in your front before he arrives. If there is not a well-organized system of scouts please organize one.

C. H. MORGAN,Brevet Brigadier-General, &amp;c.

BALTIMORE, MD., March 4, 1865-11 a.m.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

One of our most intelligent detectives reports that he has discovered that the rebels intend a raid from Fairfax into Washington to-day, but that one of the rebels who has been in Washington and Baltimore returned to Fairfax yesterday to warn them that he thought the military authorities in Washington were prepared for them, and that the raid had better be postponed. The friends of the party who has gone to Fairfax to warn the rebels fear he may not get there in time, and that the raiders would attempt to reach Washington. I thought best to give you the information.

W. W. MORRIS,

Brevet Brigadier-General.
