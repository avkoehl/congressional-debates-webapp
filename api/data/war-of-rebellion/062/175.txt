You are instructed, should any Texans who have come within the lines form the enemy make any attempt to get by the picket-lines and escape again to the enemy, to give such orders to the guards that they shall be shot on the spot and not captured. You are also directed to put a stop to small boats leaving your post for the purpose of getting fish and oysters or any other pretense, except when they have on board at least 4 good reliable soldiers, well armed, so as to prevent any treachery.

Respectfully,

HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Matagorda Peninsula, Tex., January 28, 1864.

Brigadier General W. P. BENTON,

Commanding Post at Indianola:

You will be very careful to provide against any attack by water on such transports as may at any time be lying at or near your wharf, and will keep your troops well on the alert and some of your artillery properly disposed with that purpose. You will see that the transports, whilst they are there, have their guns and their crews constantly ready for action, and will always, at such times, keep at least 100 men on guard on or in the vicinity of the transports, ready instantly to repel a boat attack.

I have the honor to remain, very respectfully,

N. J. T. DANA,

Major-General.
