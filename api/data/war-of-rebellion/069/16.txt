HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 20, 1864-8.10 a. m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

General Burnside is ordered to push forward his pickets. Major-general commanding directs that you push forward your pickets and feel the enemy, giving your pickets such support as you can without weakening you main line. The enemy on the right were driven back last evening and retired before daylight. We lost some 600 in killed and wounded; the enemy at least as heavily, and between 200 and 300 prisoners. The force you sent to the support of the right will be retained there until further orders.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 20, 1864-9.30 a. m.

Major-General WRIGHT,

Commanding Sixth Corps:

The major-general commanding directs that you make examination and preparation for holding your position on the right of the army upon General Warren's corps being withdrawn. This will require you to refuse your right and to hold Bleak Hill (Myers') and probably Anderson's. Engineers will be sent you immediately to aid in the examinations and preparations. The withdrawal of Warren will be in connection with Hancock's movement.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,May 20, 1864. (Received 10.40 a. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The only trains from this corps between this and Fredericksburg are the wagons going for and returning with supplies. Some twenty-five wagons now unloading are to take back wounded of Second Corps, and are ordered to return by the Massaponax road. The trains also go from Fredericksburg to Bell Plain for supplies. It was in reference to all these that the question concerning guards was asked. If the roads are unsafe guards should be sent by me if not otherwise provided.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS MARY OF THE POTOMAC,May 20, 1864-10.45 a. m.

COMMANDING OFFICER SIXTH CORPS:

The road to Fredericksburg and that to Belle Plain are deemed sufficiently safe without escort.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
