other small craft, were destroyed by fire, the iron-work only remaining.

While at Currituck Bridge I dispatched a colored man with cart to bear the intelligence to Great Bridge, which he accomplished in the most satisfactory manner, though searched on the road.

Major Kleinz, with his battalion, was ordered to make a scout in the direction of the occurrence.

I also, on my arrival at Great Bridge, sent Captain Ker, with a squadron, down on the north side of the North Landing River.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. LEWIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

OCTOBER 17, 1863.-Skirmish near Camden Court-House, N. C.

Report of Lieutenant Colonel William Lewis, Fifth Pennsylvania Cavalry.

GREAT BRIDGE, VA., October 20, 1863.

LIEUTENANT: I have the honor to report the following from Major McCandless, at South Mills, N. C.:

While on a return with a detachment of his cavalry, numbering 40, from a scout to Camden Court-House, the rear of his column was fired on by guerrillas concealed in the swamps, by which Privates Taggart, of Company F, and Wolf, of Company I, were killed, and Private Hoover, Company C, wounded. This occurred about 4 miles from the court-house and 8 miles from South Mills. We had heard that 15 of these men had been seen during the day, and every precaution was taken by sending out carbineers to skirmish the front and flanks, but did not discover the concealed foe until the firing commenced in the rear.

The carbineers were immediately called back and the swamps scoured, but without being able to overtake any of the enemy. As a means of retaliation Colonel Tolles has consented to the sending out of mixed parties of infantry and dismounted cavalry with three days' rations to play their own game.

I would also report the safe return of Captain Ker, with his squadron, from the scout of North Landing River. Nothing of importance occurred during the scout.

He went so far as Pungo Landing, where the tug White had been destroyed, and found none of the enemy, but learned that the party who committed the outrage had returned, going in the direction of Church's Island.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. LEWIS,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.

Lieutenant C. H. SHEPARD,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
