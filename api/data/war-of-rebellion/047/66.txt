MORRIS ISLAND, August 27, 1863-9.30 a.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Can I take from your vessel another 8-inch gun and a 100-pounder? I have burst three 8-inch guns in all.

We took 68 prisoners, including 2 officers, and gained 100 yards toward Wagner yesterday.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 27, 1863-9.55 a..

General GILLMORE:

You can take the guns with pleasure. My attempt to pass the forts last night was frustrated by the bad weather, but chiefly by the setting in of a strong flood tide.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.

MORRIS ISLAND, August 27, 1863-1.30 p.m.

Admiral DAHLGREN:

Thanks for the guns. Have you any plans that would render it inexpedient for me to throw a strong calcium light on Sumter and Cumming's Point to-night? Prisoners say that re-enfrocements and supplies are brought over in small boats from Sumter to Cumming's Point at night.

GILLMORE,

General.

OFF MORRIS ISLAND, August 27, 1863-7.55 p.m.

General GILLMORE:

Not being able to complete my arrangements, I shall not move up to-night. If you wish to use your calcium lights, it will not inconvenience me.

DAHLGREN,

Admiral.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE SOUTH, In the Field, Morris Island, S. C., August 27, 1863.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,Commanding Confederate Forces, Charleston, S. C.:

SIR: On the 26th instant a steamer, having a flag of truce, came out of Charleston Harbor, and, disregarding the notice to stop, which was repeatedly given in the usual manner-by the firing of a gun from my batteries - continued on her course to a point far within my lines. It is, I presume, unnecessary to assert that such conduct is in flagrant violation of the usages of war, forfeit the protection to which the flag would be otherwise entitled.
