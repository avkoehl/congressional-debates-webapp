The general being absent no orders can be issued from here until his return. The movement, however, will undoubtedly be made and I therefore send you the information that you may make any preliminary arrangements. Being in readiness will not necessitate the withdrawal of any of your troops from the present line.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. HOUGH,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. ARMY AND DIVISION OF WEST MISSISSIPPI,April 8, 1865.

Major-General STEELE:

In reply to General Hawkins' communication of yesterday's date, complaining of the shortness of the ration, I am instructed to say that the commissary department has been ordered to issue the full army ration so long as the troops are not actually on the march and while the quantity of supplies on hand and the means of transportation justify it.
