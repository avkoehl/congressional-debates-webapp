Your telegram announcing the quota of this State for 300,000 militia has been received. Minnesota has furnished 930 three- months" troops and 5,631 troops under last year's call for 500,000 troops. Our excess under the first two calls for volunteers by the President amounts to about 1,400. Shall it not be credited to the State?
