Colonel STRICKLAND,

Glasgow:

Rebel Hughs was at Columbia this evening, robbing stores, &amp;c. You will arm and equip Colonel Spaulding's and Martin's men, and start them in pursuit immediately, with orders to impress horses when any give out. Subsist off the country. Your infantry can hold Glasgow against any force that approach from direction of Cumberland River.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, October 17, 1863.

Colonel STRICKLAND,

Glasgow:

Leave sufficient cavalry for scouts. Did you send any men in direction of Columbia this morning? If the expedition learns that rebels have left Columbia, they will take nearest route to overtake them.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.

JONESBOROUGH, October 17, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

I received General Parke's telegram. The command, except that sent to Rogersville, has been engaged in destroying the road east and west of Zollicoffer. In pursuance with your orders of yesterday I ordered them to continue till late in evening, giving time to forage, and not to work to-morrow, the Sabbath, but to leave guard, 20 men and lieutenant, at each; and the main force some to this place.

Five bridges and half a mile of the track have been destroyed effectually above Bristol, a part of the track and switches at Bristol; also a small part of the track below Bristol. The Zollicoffer bridge completely destroyed, and the pillars greatly injured.

The question was asked the depot agent yesterday evening how long it would take to repair it. He answered, "It never would be done," for they had not the iron and materials to make the repairs. I don't think they will attempt to repair this fall or winter; but if you still desire more of the road destroyed on Monday or to-morrow, I will send orders out for the command to remain.

Do you think the guards ordered sufficient?

Please give me any news you may have, and if there is any mail for us please have if forwarded.

J. M. SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.
