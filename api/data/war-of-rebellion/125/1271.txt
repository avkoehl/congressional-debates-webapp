Messrs. TERENCE FARLEY, LEWIS R. RYERS, and others,

Committee, &amp;c.:

GENTLEMEN: In reply to your memorial of the 12th instant, in relation to the draft and volunteer enlisting in New York, I have the honor to state that this Department, having, upon consultation with Lieutenant-General Grant, come to the conclusion that the recent campaigns have left in the field no rebel force that can withstand the armies of the Union, it has bee deemed expedient to stop all drafting and recruiting under the pending call of the President, and it is believed that the force now on foot many soon be reduced.

Yours, truly,

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The provost-marshals refuse to muster in the recruits raised for colored regiments now organizing. Please allow me to recruit them to the maximum. It would be well to continue enlisting blacks at least until May 15, when the State Legislature meets and will probably pass the amendment, if colored recruiting is kept up till that time. We are recruiting as an argument forcible.

Major-General, Commanding.

A copy of this telegram certified by you will serve as a formal order for that purpose, which, on notification by you, they will obey accordingly.
