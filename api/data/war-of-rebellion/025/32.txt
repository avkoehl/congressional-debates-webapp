HEADQUARTERS FOURTH DIVISION, June 25, 1862.

Major General WILLIAM T. SHERMAN, Moscow, Tenn.:

Major Ricker reports the enemy advancing on him force, how great he cannot say. His outside pickets are driven in. I shall be ready for action. I think it is only cavalry. A negro reports that they intend to fortify at Coldwater.

I send this by messenger at 5.30 p. m.

In haste.

S. A. HURLBUT,Brigadier-General.

LA GRANCE, June 25, 1862.

General HALLECK, Corinth:

All bridges done expect the one at Moscow, which is promised to be ready for the passage of cars to-day. I trust you will order a train through from Corinth. There is a train at Memphis, but they will not permit it to come to my camp; also I have no telegraph, the machine and operator being at La Grange, and all my cavalry is guarding provision trains, so I am cut off from all communication. My provision train will be back to-morrow early. The road will then be done, and I can then take position at Coldwater (6 miles from Holly Springs) or at the Junction or at La Grange, wherever you may order.

We have vague rumors of a heavy force, 30,000 men, coming up from Grenada. I know that the Tallahatchie Bridge is destroyed; that one regiment of infantry and one of cavalry were there last Sunday; that a small detachment of cavalry came into Holly Springs and to Coldwater Creek, 6 miles this side, and then returned to the Tallahatchie, 18 miles south of Holly Springs. Cars come that far north, but no farther.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
