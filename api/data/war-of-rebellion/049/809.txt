Major General ARNOLD ELZEY,

Commanding, &amp;c., Richmond, Va.:

GENERAL: Your telegram is received. I wish to put you on your guard against the mischief that may result from sending dispatches containing information as to the number and position of our troops, unless they be put in cipher. Whenver such matters cannot be made the subject of a letter, which is always prefrabel when possible, they should be sent by telegraph in cipher, as facts have before this found their way to the public, and of course of the enemy, under such circumstnaces as to induce me to abstain from sendingopen telgrams about thinks that ought not to be known. I adivse you to pursue this course. You can order the troops from Hanover Junction to you, as soon as you see proper, giving me notice when you do.

If it be true that all of General Foster's troops are being withdrawn from the coast of North Carolina, theforces that have been opposing them can also be withdrawn, and if you ascertain the fact satisfactorily, you can apply to the Secretary of War to order up the disposable troops from North Carolina, including such as can be spared from Wilmington, who will nolonger be of service there after the enemy has withdrawn, excepting a sufficient guard to prevent raids by small parties.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

R. E. LEE,

General.

Please direct General Rosser, or whoever ommands the cavalry near the scene of his operations, to notify Colonel Willis of any danger, and should he call for any cavalry besides the squadron, to furnish it.
