Brigadier-General TOTTEN:

Two hundred and forty men that I sent yesterday to Independence, under Major Bredett, have just returned, and report that Independence was attacked by 1,500 men, under a Colonel Hughes and Quantrill, and after four hours' hard fighting Lieutenant-Colonel Buel surrendered. It is reported that the rebels are marching on this place. Major McKee has not yet arrived. I shall telegraph Colonel Catherwood to send me two or three companies. I am very anxious in regard to Major Linder, of Harrisonville, with his two companies. He must be on the march to Independence.
