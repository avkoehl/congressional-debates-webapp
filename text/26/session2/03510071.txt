Senate.
the National Treasury, would receive gready the
most in the dividend I might rnn out the idea,
and push the argument on this po>nt; bat as my ob-
ject is brevi'y, and as I have much yet to say, 1
will pass to the consideration of another v,e.v of
the subject, believing that I am understood by the
Senate.
In presenting another view of the subject, I may
be permitted to contrast the benefits to the new
Stales supposed by the friends of ihe bill to be con-
ferred by it with those arising from the dis'ribution
plan, which is its antagonist measure. And in
this point of view, I am prepjred to show that even
Arkansas, one of the most favored States, wou'd
be much the gamer by the distribution bill even m
a pecuniary point of view, it she had as much In-
dian title to extinguish as Michigan, and confining
it exclusively in the fstimate to the lands lying m
Arkansas. If I sustain this position, it follows
that ihere i* not a strfgie S ate m the Union, hold-
ing land subject to the extmgui-hment of Indian
title, that could take the measure without a great
pecuniary sacrifice as a substitute for the dis'ribu-
tion bill. Senators may think I am venturing upon
bold ground, and I am very sure the Senator from
South Carolina, m my eye, believes that ihe posi-
tion cannot be maintained, but let him hear me
answer the argument growing out of a statement
of the case, for, fortunately ior me, the case is not
to be made out by argument, the proof lies in the
statement of trie facts of the case. Arkansas, by
the bill of the Senator from South Carolina, would
receive t'sirty-five per cent, upon the sales of her

'This «evcluaive of 8 932,440 acres, not yet ceded to the
United States iu Michigan, and about fl?e or six hundred thou-
sand in Ohio and Indiana, making, in all, about nine millions
and a half.
unsrld l nds. She will leccive, as the law nov/
stands, five per cent, which is taKen from her by
the bill and included in the ihirty-fi"e per cent;
this leaves het thirty per ce .. The distribution
bill gives her twelve and one-halt pT ceiJ and
leaves her m possession of her five p'r c nv rvafe-
ing seventeen and one-half per cen1 , anu i ien
gives her her proportion, in the ratio of represen'a-
tion, of the other eighty-two and one half per cent,
which would raise the aggregate amount to be re-
ceived by the State to over twenty-per cent, with-
out any expense of the land system^or the exiin-
gui hment of Indian title, leaving, at this stage of
the calculation, less than ten p r cent in facorof
Mr. Calhoun's bill. For this ten per cent, the
Siate would be compelled to pay the expenses of
the land sys'em, the surveys, the sales ot the land,
and the extinguishment of the Indian till'., for the
provisions in the bill are
"This cession, together with the portion of the sales to be re
tainedby the States respectively unJer the provisions of this
act, shall he in full of thefive percent fund, or anypartthere
of not already accrued to any State, and the eaid States shall be
exclusively liable for all chaiges that may hereafter arise from
the suivejs, sales, and management of ttie public lands and ex
tmgm^hment of I ldian title withm the limits of said States re
spectnely "
Now, sir, can any Senator say that the State
could do all that is required of her for the ten per
cent? or wou'd any State accept of such a propo-
sition in lieu of the distribution bill, if both were
pres"nted'¡ It may not be amiss to look a little
further into the cost of this matter, or, as in the
case of Bumb'e, the beadle, to examine ihe spoon*,
and see if they are the pure stuff What is in-
cluded in the extinguishment of Indian title? My
eye has beea turned a little to that matter, and ihere
may besóme items that even some of the Senators
from the new Slates now favonrg this bill have not
considered. I will name some of them for ihe^cor-
sid^ration oí the Sena e The costs or expense of
extinguishing Indian title include ihe expense of
ho'din^ the treaty, including the suppart of .he In-
dians in their encampment and in council; the cos's
of the commission to hold the treat); the price
given for the lands, the removal of the Indians
West, the purcnase of lands for them for iheir
new homes; their support in their new position for
at least a year, the expense of a commission to in-
vestigate claims against them, for all these enter
into t'ie consideration of modern treaties. Woald
ten per cent pay these expenses? L-t one of the
States Iry it, and, my word for it, such State will be
largely minus in the account. Then, sir, ihe bill
is clearly delusive to the new Stale , most cr'amly
not to intended by the distinguished mover, for I
give him full ere nt for good faith to those State-;
but it seems to me he has not done jusiice to hi 
sttong and vigorous mind, by bringing it to bear
fully upon the subject, or he would not have pre-
sented this bill as just to all, or specially beneficial
to any of the new States.
There is, however, another view of the question
which shou'd settle the m .tVr beyond controversy.
The argument I iisve íatroluced has been con-
fined to an examination of the bill with reference
to the lands lym  in ihe Suues Thu is a very cir-
cumscribed Vitw of ihe cuv. I so intended it, as
it rovers enly one hundred and su.y millions of
acres o>U of the ten hundied millions of acre-
Bu still it must not be forgotten that while the bill
of the Sena'or from South Carolina confines itssif
to the one hundied and s xty millions of acres, the
distribution measure covers the whole, and distá-
bales, not only the pneeeds of the one hundred
and sixty millions, but also of the res,due of the
ten bundled millions; and while the cession bill es-
tablishes the principle that so soon as a State is ad-
mitttd >nto the Union the lands must be ceded, the
other continues the distubut.on Without, there-
fore, goirg into the great variety of important
questuns which have been discussed by others rela-
tive to the power and expediency of the amend-
ment of the Senator from South Carolina, I am
compelled to arrive at the conciu-ion that it is my
duty to vote against it, and if it shou'd pass and
become a Iw, aud the qaestion shall be put to me
whethei the propos'tion should be accep ed by my
State, I should have to answer m the negative.
I have now, Mr. President, arrived at that point
of the argument when it becomes necessary to dis-
cuss the ma ■<, subject befare us: I mean the pro-
posed amendment of the Senator from Kentucky,
(tu Crittenío i )
Bn<¡ Mr. Mjíümck asked Mr. Smith to give
way to im'-ioa io adj. - m. Mr S. having spoken
c*e? &ii nout and a hall, and i' being late in the
evening, the Senate adjourned.]
At the moment of the adjournment, Mr. Presi-
dent, on yesterday, I had aruved at what seemed
to me to be the main ques'ioa before the Senate.
I had said someih'og about the graduation and
pre-emption bills and their kindred subjects. I had
attempied to exánime some of the provisonsof the
bill of the Sena'or from South Carolina. I had
admitted the importance of the question before us,
and I had mged the great importance and the ur-
gent netessiiy of placing ihis whole matter on the
basis of a judicious compromise. Commencing,
theiefore, at the point where my remarks were ar-
rested, (for 1 shall avoid repetition as much as pos-
sible) I will proceed to give my views upon the
question of <'i tribution, in which it will be my pur-
pose to show why it is, m my opinion, entitled to
my support, and to answer some of the objections
that had been urged against it The Senator from
Arkansas [Mr. SeviebJ alluded to this subject the
other day, and I confess I was rather disappointed
in his course of remarks- I did expect and I did
hope to hear that Senator discuss the men's of the
proposition. I was anxioo>to hear his views, for
they are usually marked with a strong vein of
common sense and practical illustration. The Se-
nator, however, declined the argument, and con-
tented himsell wi h saying that 'he measure was
dead, and by telling us that the Senator from Mis-
souri [Mr. Benton] had killed it Yes, says the
Senator from Arkansas, the Senator from Missouri
murdered it as soon as it nas introduced. I hope
the Senator did not mean to c1- arge the malice
aforethought, which is a constituent of the crime of
technical murder.
[Mr. Sevier said yes, sir ]
Well, Mr. President, I have only to say that,
while malice is Essential to constitute a killing
murder m the eye of the law, it is not so essential
m the composition of a legislator We should
meet the questions that are presented for our con-
sideration wall calmness and deliberation. I do
not say that the Senator from Missouri did not so
discuss this question. I am merely rep'ying to the
remaric of the Senator irom Arkansas.
It so happens that I diner entirely wnh the Sena
tor from Arkansas m the assumption that he has
indulged m, that the proposition of distribution is
eithei killed or murdered. Sir, that proposition is
not dead, but liveth; and, !e'me tell Senators who
think that it is dead, that they will find it not only
living, but that it is destined to beromethe law of
the land, and that, too, before many more sessions
of Congress shall have passed by. It should, in.
my opinion, long siuce have been tbe law. If the
bill that was introduced by the S-'ni tor frrm Ken-
tucky, [Mr. Clay,] and wb ca passed Congress
dunrg the administration of Gineral Jackson, had
become the law, u would have been a most valua-
ble rneasu'e for the whole Union, and especially for
my Stve, and I assuie you s i, while many of
the ai'herenb of General Jackson still sustained
him, it waa for other reasons t1 an h.s opposition to
the éisíriDuíion bul. The same measure is now
before us, and I shall pve ,t my nearly support,
and not hue my friend frr in Arkansas. I shall
not con'ent myself with a mere expression of opi-
nion. I desire my State to see the distmc: grounds
of my s-ippori, for I have no oenument to conceal
on this or any other measure.
First. 1 support the bill because it is the only
compromise measure upon which all can unite,
and wh cb, with proper provisions, will do ample
justice to both the old and the new States. The
interest of the Dew States will be amply protected,
and the rghts of the old States wi I be maintained
in the distribution of tne fand. The difficulties
spoken of by ¡he Senator from Soath Carolina, as
arising from the present system, will be partially
obviated, and the voice of discontent between the
new States and the old, growing out of the sub-
ject, will be forever hushed,   instead of making
