chasing the materials and making up a por-

The chief of (.he Bureau of Medicine and Sur-
gery presents not only the usual lcpoit of
sickness and death in the Navy during the
year, but gives in addition interesting tables
showing the number of sick of each squadron
engaged on the blockade during the war,
together with the total of (*ach disease treated,
number of deaths on the blockade during the
rebellion, proportion of deaths to the number
of cases treated, and the proportion of deaths
to the number of ship's company. The sum-
mary shows that from the commencement of
the rebellion to the 00th of June, 1865, there
were under treatment 114,038 cases; that
there were 2,532 deaths, the proportion of
deaths to the number of cases treated being
.0175. At the close of the year 1865 there
remained under treatment 853 cases; during
the year 18G6 there occurred 24,350 cases of
disease, injury, &c., making a total of 25,203
cases treated during the year, of which 310
died ; 23,954 were returned to duty or dis-
charged the service, leaving 1)39 cases under
treatment at the end of the year I860. The
proportion of cases admitted to the whole
number of persons in the service was about
rfg, or each person was on the sick list 1.4fi
times during the year. The proportion of
deaths to the whole numb er in service was
.018, and the per ccntage of deaths to the
whole number of cases treated is .012, or less
than two per cent.—taking the average
strength of the Navy (officers, seamen, ma-
rines, engineer service and coast survey
included) for the year I860, to bo 17,193.
The fotal number of deaths from all causes,
reported at the Navy Department from Octo-
ber h, 1800, to September 30, 1S07, is 395.
The number of insane of the Navy under
treatment in the Government Asylum near
Washington, during the year ending 30th
September, 1867, was 24 ; number now under
treatment, 18. The necessity for enlarging
the laboratory accommodation continues to
press itself upon the attention of the Bureau,
and estimates for this purpose have again
been submitted.
The commandant of the Marine corps re-
ports that at the annual inspection he found
the troops in a thorough state of discipline and
efficiency, and the several barracks and quar-
ters in a creditable condition. The men are
kept in constant readiness for duty at sea or
on shore, and at short notice could be concen-
trated, in condition for effective service, at
any point where the presence of troops might
be required. The number of officers and men
attached to vessels in commission is now some-
what less than usual. The now infantry tac-
tics recently introduced into the Army has
been adopted, and the corps is now being
instructed in conformity therewith. Two offi-
cers and several men have died of yellow fever
at Pensacola. The commandant of the corps
renews the recommendation of last year that a
new barracks be erected 'at Washington, a
board composed of officers, a civil engineer,
and master mechanic, after a thorough exam-
ination, having reported that it is not expedi-
ent to attempt to repair the present structures.
CONCLUSION.
In concluding this report it is gratifying to
state that, while the reduction of vessels in
commission has steadily progressed, and while
our squadrons are limited to the smallest num-
ber of steamers compatible with the require-
ments of commerce, the protection of our
countrymen, and the dignity and power of the
nation, the vigilance and activity of our naval
officers, with their small but efficient com-
mands, have been such as to cause our flag to
be exhibited in almost every important port on
the globe ; and it is a satisfaction to know that
the demonstration of a naval force has every-
where been sufficient to cause'itto be respected,
and to give security to the persons and property
of American citizens. Our commerce, which
was seriously affected during the prevalence of
civil war, in consequence of the countenance
and encouragement extended to the rebels by
foreign Governments, has not, from the con-
tinued unsettled condition of our domestic
a (fairs, recovered its former vigor; but the
Navy has, in guarding American interests and
maintaining American rights, performed its
duty, fostered trade, and, with the recstablish-
ment of the Union, will contribute to restore
our former commercial prosperity and success.
If our ships and men in service are vastly in-
ferior in numbers to other maritime Powers, it
is a matter of just pride that, for eflicicncy in
guarding the interests of our countrymen, in
opening new avenues to trade, in exploring
and rendering safe the ocean highways trav-
ersed by adventurous navigators, and for every
useful purposes, they are surpassed by those
of no other nation, and that (hey continue to
assert our rights and maintain (he credit and
renown which has ever belonged to (he Amer-
ican Navy. GIDEON WELLES.

Report of the Secretary of the Treasury.
Treasury Department,
Wasixgtox, November 30, 1807.
In conformity with law. the Secretary of the
Treasury lias the honor to submit to Congress
this his regular annual report.
The finances of the United States, notwith-
standing the continued depreciation of the cur-
rency, are in a much more satisfactory condi-
tion than they were when the Secretary had
the honor to make to Congress his last annual
report. Since the 1st day of November, 1806,
$493,990,263 34 of interest-bearing notes, cer-
tificates of indebtedness, and of temporary
loans, have been paid or converted into bonds;
and the public debt, deducting therefrom the
cash in the Treasury, which is to be applied to
its payment, has been reduced §59,805,555 72.
During the same period decided improvement
has also been witnessed in the general eco-
nomical condition of the country. The policy
of contracting the currency, although not
enforced to the extent authorized by law, has
prevented an expansion of credits, to which a
redundant and especially a depreciated cur-
rency is always an incentive, and has had no
little influence in stimulating labor and increas-
ing production. Industry has been steadily
returning to the healthy channels from which
it was diverted during (he war, and although
incomes have been small, and trade generally
inactive, in no other commercial country has
there been less financial embarrassment than
in the United States.
In order that the action of the Secretary, in
the financial administration of the Depart-
ment, may be properly understood, a brief
reference to the condition of the Treasury
at the time the war was drawing to a close,
and at some subsequent periods, seems to be
necessary.
On the 31st day of March, 1805, the total debt
of the United States was $2,300,955,077 31,
of the following descriptions, to wit:
Funded debt $1,100,301.2(1 SO

The resources of the Treasury consisted of
the money in the public depositories in different
parts of the country, amounting as above stated
to $50,481,924 84; the revenues from internal
taxes and customs duties, and the authority to
issue bonds, notes, and certificates, under the
following acts to the following amounts:

Certificates of indebtedness, payable one
year from date, or earlier at the option of the
Government, bearing interest at (lie rate of six
per cent, per annum, might be issued to an
indefinite amount, but only to public creditors
desirous of receiving them in satisfaction of
audited and settled demands against the United
States.
Early in April (he fall of Richmond and the
surrender of the forces which had so long de-
fended it rendered it certain that the war was
soon to be terminated, and thai, provision must
be made for (he payment of the Army at the
earliest practicable moment.
The exigency was great, and the prospect
of raising the money required to meet the pres-
ent and prospective demands upon the Treas-
ury, under tlie laws then existing, was suffi-
ciently discouraging to create solicitude and
anxiety in the mmd of a Secretary little expe-
rienced in public affairs, upon whom the
responsibility of maintaining the credit of the
nation had been unexpectedly devolved. There
was no time to try experiments or to correct
errors, if any had been committed, in the kind
of securities which, had been put upon the mar-
ket. Creditors were importunate, the unpaid
requisitions in the Department were largely in
excess of the cash in the Treasury, the vouch-
ers issued to contractors for the necessary sup-
plies of the Army and Navy were being sold
at from ten to twenty per cent, discount—indi-
cating by their depreciation how uncertain was
the prospect of early payment—while nearly
a million men were soon to be discharged
from service, who could not be mustered out
until the means to pay the large balances due
them were provided. There was no alterna-
tive but to raise money by popular subscrip-
tion to Government securities of a character
the most acccptable to the people, who had
subscribed so liberally to previous loans.
As a considerable amount of the seven-
thirty notes had recently been disposed of sat-
isfactorily by the Department, and had proved
to be the most popular security ever offered
to the people, the Secretary determined to
rely upon them, (although on the part of the
Government they were in many respects objec-
tionable.) and in order to insure speedy sub-
scriptions to place them within the reach of all
who might be willing to invest in them. In
every city and town and village of the loyal
and at some points in the disloyal States sub-
scriptions were solicited. The press, with its
immense power, and without distinction of
party, seconded the efforts of the energetic and
skillful agent who had charge of the loan. The
national banks gave efficient aid by liberal
subscriptions, while thousands of persons in
humble life and with limited means hesitated
not to commit their substance to the honor and
good faith of the Government. Before the end
of July the entire loan, exceeding five hundred
millions, was subscribed and paid for, and (ho
Secretary was enabled with tiie proceeds,
together with the receipts from customs and
internal revenues and the use to a limited
extent of other means at his disposal, to pay
every requisition upon the Treasury and every
matured national obligation. As evidence of
the necessity that existed for prompt action in
