proceedings of a largo and, unanimous meeting,
lield without distinction of party, at Sandy IiilJ,
New York, declaring their approbation of the
President's late special message to Congress; that
Major Anderson is entitled to their warmest
thanksand gratitude,and shall be sustained, what-
ever may be the consequences; that no State has
the right to dissolve its connection with thisGov-
ment, and every attempt to do so must be pre-
vented at every hazard; that every man, North
or South, who sets the Government at defiance,
and aids in secession or disunion, is guilty of
treason; calling on the Government to promptly
rcinforceFortSumter with men and supplies; to
retake, without reference to consequences, every
fort, arsenal, custom-house, or other public prop-
erty, seized by southern traitors; to immediately
blockade every harbor of every seceding State,
and stop all postal communication with them.
I also present a memorial, folded in the Ameri-
can flag, signed by five hundred and fifty-three
legal voters, without distinction of party, of
Whitehall, New York, with preamble and reso-
lutions attached, deploring the distracted condi-
tion of the country, and requesting their Senators
and instructing their Representatives in Congress
to urge the immediate passage of the Crittenden
compromise, or, without delay, adopt some other
mode of adjustment which may be satisfactory to
all sections of the Union, and forever settle this
unwise controversy and agitation.
The proceedings and memorial were laid upon

BORDER SLAVE STATES.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I offer the follow-
ing resolution:
Resolved, That the members of this House from thp bor-
der slave States be respectfully requested tosubmitTo this
[louse an ultimatum ptoposltion, embracing their views
upon the questions now dividing the Union, and by which
they are willing to stand, and pledge their respective Suites
to stand, now and hereafter, as a final settlement of said
questions.
Mr. GROW. I object to that resolution.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I move the previous
question upon the resolution.
Mr. SHERMAN. It is objected to.
The SPEAKER. The resolution is in order
under the call of the States; and the call for the
previous question by the gentleman from Illinois
cuts off debate.
Mr. GROW. If the gentleman from Illinois
had the floor when I made the objection, I sup-
pose he could move the previous question.
The SPEAKER. He was on^the floor and
moved the previous question.
Mr, WASHBURNE, of Illinois. If the pre-
vious question be not sustained, the resolution
must go over, if any gentleman proposes to de-
bate it. I call for tellers on seconding the demand
for the previous question.
Tellers were ordered; and Messrs. Somes,and
Craig of Missouri, were appointed.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I modify my res-
olution by striking out the word " border," so
as to make it read " the slave States."
The House divided; and the tellers reportedâ€”
ayes 29; noes not counted.
So the previous question was not seconded.
Mr. WASHBURNE, of Illinois. I propose
to debate the resolution.
The SPEAKER. Then the resolution must
lie over.
Mr. MORRIS, of Illinois. I move a suspen-
sion of the rules, so that the resolution may be
considered now.
Mr. HINDMAN. I believe the morning hour
has expired; and that the motion of the gentleman
from Illinois is not in order.
The SPEAKER. The morning hour has ex-
pired; and nothing is in order but to proceed to
the consideration of the special order, upon which
the gentleman from Virginia [Mr. Pryor] has
the floor by assignment.
Mr. SICKLES. The gentleman from Virginia
is not here to claim the floor.
Mr. BURNETT. I have sent for him, and he
will be here in a moment.
Mr. NOELL. As the gentleman from Vir-
ginia is not present, I ask the unanimous consent
of the House to take up Senate bill No 7, which
I attempted to get up the other day.
Mr. trROW. I object.
Mr. FLORENCE. I notice that a number of
propositions referred to the committee of five this
morning lia\e been ordered to be printed. I hope
that, by unanimous consent,all such propositions
will be printed.
Mr. BOCOCK. My colleague [Mr. Pryor] is
now in his place.
COLLECTION OF TIIE REVENUE, ETC.
Mr. SICKLES. With the permission of the
gentleman from Virginia, I desire to offer a reso-
lution calling for information. It will give rise to
no debate.

tinue to be collected in the poiw of entry established by

with, and what proceedings have been adopted with refer-

ADMISSION OF KANSAS.
Mr. GROW. With the permission of the gen-
tleman from Virginia, I desire to give notice to
the House that if I can get the floor when the
gentleman from Virginia has concluded, 1 shall
endeavor to call up the bill for the admission of
Kansas into the Union, which has been returned
from the Senate with amendments.
MESSAGE FR03I TIIE PRESIDENT.
Mr. STANTON. Will the gentleman from
Virginia permit a message from the President
which was received this morning, and lies upon
the Speaker's table, to be read before he com-
mences his remarks? It ought to be referred.
Mr. PRYOR. I will yield for that purpose,
provided it will not come out of my time.
Mr. STANTON. Of course not.
The SPEAKER then laid before the House a
message from the President of the United States;
which was read by the Clerk, as follows:
To the Senate and
House of Representatives of theUnited States:
I deem itmydutyto submitto Congress a series
of resolutions adopted by the Legislature of Vir-
ginia, on the 19th instant, having in view a peace-
ful settlement of the exciting questions which now
threaten the Union. They were delivered to me
on Thursday, the 24th instant, by ex-President
Tyler, who has left his dignified and honored re-
tirement in the hope that he may render service
to his country in this its hour of peril. These res-
olutions, it will be perceived, extend an invitation
" to all such States, whether slaveholdmgor non-
slaveholding, as are willing to unite with Virginia
in an earnest effort to adjust the present unhappy
controversies in the spirit in which the Constitu-
tion was originally formed, and consistently with
its principles, so as to afford to the people of the
slaveholding States adequate guarantees for the
security of their rights, to appoint commission-
ers to meet, on the 4th day of February next, in
the city of Washington, similar commissioners
appointed by Virginia, to consider, and, if prac-
ticable, agree upon some suitable adjustment.55
I confess 1 hail this movement, on the part of
Virginia, with great satisfaction. From the past
history of this ancient and renowned Common-
wealth, we have the fullest assurance that what
she has undertaken she will accomplish, if it can
be done by able, enlightened, and persevering
efforts. It is highly gratifying to know that other
patriotic States have appointed, and are appoint-
ing, commissioners to meet those of Virginia in
council. When assembled, they will constitute a
body entitled, in an eminent degree, to the confi-
dence of the country.
The General Assembly of Virginia have also
resolved " that ex-President John Tyler is hereby
appointed, by the concurrent vote of each branch
of the General Assembly, a commissioner to the
President of the United States; and Judge John
Robertson is hereby appointed, by a like vote, a
commissioner to the State of South Carolina and
the other States that have seceded or shall secede,
with instructions respectfully to request the Pres-
ident of the United States and the authorities of
such States to agree to abstain, pending the pro-
ceedings contemplated by the action of this Gen-
eral Assembly, from any and all acts calculated
to producc a collision of arms between the States
and the Government of the United States."
However strong may bemydesire toenterinto
such an agreement, I am convinced that I do not
