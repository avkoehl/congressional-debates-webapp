1856.                                THE CONGR'ESSIONAL, GLOBE.                                    103
tion in relation to our haying obtained an advan-
tage in our diplomatic transactions with France
At present, however, the fairness of our claims
was no longer open for discussion. Every branch
of the French Government had passed upon
them The King, the Peers, and the Chamber
of Deputies, had all given their sanction to their
validity.
The papers containing the debate in the French
Chambers, laid on our tables last year, had been
circulated throughout the whole nation, and the
merits of the controversy were distinctly under-
stood by our countrymen everywhere And
although there might be a reluctance on the part
of all to go to war with our " ancient ally," still
he felt satisfied, that to sustain our honor m this
dispute there would be but one sentiment in the
event of such an issue. It certainly was a subject
of gratulation to know that this matter was so
well comprehended by the people at large With
the President's message, at the opening of the
session before them, which they had received
with great unanimity, they were willing to intrust
the most delicate question of peace or war to the
Congress of the nation.
The chairman of the Committee on Ways and
Means had, under an impression that the con-
dition of the country required it now, moved to
enlarge one of the items in the appropriation bill,
with the view of increasing the naval force of the
country A short time since the House passed a
resolution directing an inquirv into the propriety
of this measure To this enlargement of the ap-
propriation, the gentleman from South Carolina
objected For himself,Mr S said he would vote
for the proposition with great cheerfulness We
must look to the organs of the House, in a great
measure, for information, and we find in this
instance the committee, through their chanman,
ask for the increase This is not the time for
very precise calculations as to the amount we
may be willing to put at the command of the
Government for the defense of the Republic
The gentleman from South Carolina saw noth-
ing impioper, in the course of the French, in re-
lation to the recent orders of that Government
concerning their fleet Mr S said, whatever
might be the de sign of the French vessels in sail-
ing m this direction, he thought u would comport
with sound policy for us to look to our Navy,
and in peace (perhaps he might say upon the
verge of hostilities) to prepare for war Under
these impressions, he promised his humble aid to
the committee in support of all the appropriation
bills that went for a prompt and efficient defense
of the Union. The Chief Magistrate ought to
have ample means to meet any contingency, and
he saw no danger in committing them to his dis- *
cretion. We could not find safer hands. He
had, during our last contest, given us asure pledge
of his patriotism and ability to carry on the mili-
tary operations of the nation. His great skill
manifested in the darkest period of a war that
he ended so gloriously, will, in the event of a con-
test with the French, do much to bring it to a
speedy termination The appropriation now
asked is to be put at the command of General
Jackson, and I am the more willing to commit it
to his discretion, because, in my judgment, I be-
lieve he nevpr will recommend war with the coun-
try of La Fayette, unless a just sense of national
honor requires it Mr S said, he was convinced
that every section of the Republic would ardently ,
support the war if we should be forced into it by
the French Government. France, it was true,
was an early friend, and to raise arms against
her would require great provocation, but if her
course leaves us no other alternative, why we must
•nd will enter the lists with her We hear much
about the strength and improvement of the French I
navy—of the science and skill of her officers
Th's is doubtless all true, but argues the propriety
of granting the appropriations before the Com-
mittee of the Whole House Whatever may be
the advanced condition of the French marine, and
however gallantly they may sustain their cause,
I have no fear that our " star-spangled banner"
will not come out of every conflict beaming with
renewed luster. But I do not wish for war, and
least of all awarwith France, if itcan be shunned i
with honor. At present, I think the question of
war is not properly open for debate upon the '
amendment. When that time should arrive, if '
any gentleman from South Caiohm, or else-
where, should feel disposed to enter u ion the dis-
cussion of its propuety, they will find themselves
met on all quarters by gentlemen who are pre-
pared to sustain the country in such a crisis I
quit this debate, under a firm conviction that, if
we should be compelled to assume a warlike atti-
tude, the sons of South Carolina will pour out
their blood as freely as any other State in the
Union, in defense ot their much-wronged country
Mr BYNUM said that he had not expected an
attack on the measures of the Administration
generally, on the subject of the propriety of an
appropriation of an inferior magnitude , but it
could not be unknown to the House that a simul-
taneous attack had been made else when, and he
could not allow the declamations of the honorable
gentleman from South Caiolina [Mi Thompson]
against the Preside nt and the policy of an Admin-
istration to which he, in pait, had contributed his
humble support, to pass unnoticed, when he
believed the President had acted as became the
Chief Magistrate of the American people Itwas
evident, both in this House and elsewhere, that,
in the contest with France, vvc are to have here a
French party and an American party, than which
there was nothing that he more sinci íely regretted.
The game was up—it had been started in another
part of the Capitol It could not be foi gotten by
any gentleman in Congress that, during our last
contest with Great Britain, there was said to have
been in this country an English party—a pnry
which made bonfires, and rejoiced at the defi at
of the American arms. God torbid (said Mr B )
that there should be a par'y now springing up
among us who would rejoice at our def ats in a
contest Willi France, if we should be uvfoitu-
nately involved in a wai with that Power, but he
asserted that, fiom what he had seen, the Amer-
ican people had a light to expect this—the symp-
toms indicating it too manifest to be misundei-
stood.
A few years ago, the distinguished sage who
now occupies the White House, was assailed on
another occasion, with equal amnionv and viru-
lence, by the same party, for the purpose of es-
tranging, no doubt, the feelings of the people
from him. That party acted then upon the pre-
sumption, that the ignoiance of the people would
admit of their being led away fiom the Picsidcnt
of their choice by mere clamor and unfounded dec-
lamation Mr B then had said the people would
not sustain them—they had not done it, and the
great majority then in that House, in favoi of
the measures of the Executive, was the best living
evidence of the fact, and he rejoiced that he had
lived to read the testimony of the American people
themselves on the subject, by the appearance of
such an overwhelming majority of their Repre-
sentatives in that House. If we had been car-
ried off by the eloquent tact and abuse of the
superior leaders of the Opposition, and he confessed
many were, we should have been led off after a
set of men who were conspiring against the feel-
ings and Wishes of a great majority of the Amer-
ican people, without the least concurrence of
sentimentorprinciple amongst themselves Being
foiled, however, in their attempts heretofore, they
have agre ed to try and get up another hobby, and
have seized this occasion to vent their gall against
one of the most patriotic individuals that has ever
lived in this or any other country, and who had
done more for the security of American liberty
than any man now breathing—the assertions of
the gentleman notwithstanding—whose character
the whole American people stood pledged to sup-
port, and which they had vouched for by the
overwhelming votes which he had received at
their hands more than once, for the first office in
the gift of the nation The gentleman from South
Carolina [Mr. Thompson] had said, that in every
position taken in relation to France the President
had acted falsely If Mr B was to infer from
that, that the President had acted falsely with
France he denied it The American President
had not, nor could not act, falsely with France,
or any other power living. In behalf of the
American people he denied it
Mr. THOMPSON explained He did not in-
tend to say the President had acted falsely, but
had taken false positions
Mr BYNUM resumed He said he was glad
I the gentleman had qualified the assertion Then
it w as a mere mattei of opinion between the gen-
tleman fiom South Carolina and the President of
the United States, and tt would be for the great
body oi the American people to say, vvhethci the
President of the United States was r.ght in the
posmoi he had taken, or whether the gentleman
fiom South Cirohna was right in that which he
had Liken Mi L said ho most cordially agreed
iii the íemarks of the gentleman from Kentucky,
[Mr HeWEs,] a few days ago, when he said he
believed that much mischict had giown out of
speeches made hero and tlscwheio, through a
mere spirit ot opposition to the Executive He
believed it candidly and ho lestly France be-
lieved it, and foi this uason, she had actedmore
obs mate Ij , h< had no doul t, than she otherwise
would have done, in her refusal to pay our peo-
ple the |ust debt, that she had wrongfully with-
held fiom t'iem for more than twenty years
The gentleman from South Carolina had said,
too, that if we were to go to war with Trance it
would be a ridiculous war As much as he was
opposed to a wai with France, or any other
power, he could not behove that it would be a
udiculous war The characters of the parties
coii"erned forbid such an idea It had been said
elsi where, and repeated heie by the gentleman,
sholl we go to war v i h France for five millions
of dolíais —he would say yes, and for five mil-
lions of cents, if it were necessary to maintain
the honor and independence of the nation He
was aston shed t'iat such a position should be
taken by the gentleman, coming from the quarter
that he d d—that it was the amount of money
for which a nation shou'd alone go to war ' He
luizaidcd nothing in saying t'iat time would
show , that the course taken by the President in
relation to Trance was not only niht, but neces-
sary, for the honor and sccunty of the rights and
digm y of t'ie Amencan people The American
people had given as far as public sentiment could
bo ascertained then verdict already, on this sub-
ject, in favor of the course of their Government,
ai'd st II the Opposition were catching at this and
other hobbies to bolster up their prostiate and
exposed condition. Mr B. wished to make one
icmark here to an honorable gentleman of another
body,and it became him to make it, comingfrom
the State from which he did. He saw, in a public
journal a few days since, some remarks, repre-
sented to have fallen from that honorable gentle-
man, in anothei pait of this building, which was,
(said Mr B ,) "that the House of Representative 
was not the pait of the Capitol where fair play
was to be expected " He did not wish paiticu-
Urly to remark on the charactei of the author of
the assertion, as he thought it at this time polit-
ically an exceedingly unenviable one He took
occasion, however, to say that the assertion was
a calumny on the House, and was devoid of all
truth Ihe House of Representatives was the
only Democratic branch of the National Legis-
latuie, and from it the people of the country had
evci y tiling to expect, and little from the opposite
bodv
Tne Democracy of the land had nothing to ex-
pect from that quarter of this Capitol. It was the
only germ of an irresponsible aristocracy in the
Government, and it had in more than one instance
showed an entire disregaid of the will of the peo-
ple. The gentleman from South Carolina had
said the House was not so pugnacious as to adopt
the admonition, that in time of peace we should
prepare for war, and had said much, ironically,
he supposed, of the pugnacious spirit of the
House
Mr B said, he should really like to know
when the honorable gentleman from South Caro-
lina had become so pacific, and the party with
whom he had acted so long But a few years
since, he recollected well, that the golden cord that
bound this holy Union together was upon the ere
of being bursted asunder by the warlike spirit
that had prevailed in a certain quarter of this
Republic, and it was as much as the whole fra-
ternity of the States could effect to suppress this
spn it w ithout the horrors of bloodshed
Mr B said, he stood there the representative
of those who went for their w hole country He
stuck to no party longer than that party stuck to
