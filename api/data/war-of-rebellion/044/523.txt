On July 1, the Fourth Regiment was not engaged, not reaching the field until after the fighting for that day had closed by the defeat of the enemy, who had been driven to the south of the town. At night, the Fourth Regiment was conducted to the left and southeast of Gettysburg, and placed in position, where it remained inactive, excepting some sharp skirmishing, until near night, when we were put in motion, and, after several changes of position, we finally moved to the right, nearer Gettysburg, and placed in position in the woods at the base of one of the hills occupied by the enemy, the summit of which they had very strongly fortified with earthworks and abatis. Early on the morning of the 3rd [Friday], my regiment became engaged with the enemy behind their defenses, in which they were exposed to a heavy and destructive fire of shot, shell, and musketry, from which the regiment sustained a heavy loss in killed, wounded, and missing of both men and officers. A large number of those missing are believed to be prisoners, as when my regiment was ordered to relieve the Thirty-third, many of the men and officers advanced so far up the side of the hill under the enemy's defenses that they afterward, when the regiments in support gave way, found it impracticable to effect a retreat. After night, my regiment with the brigade retired from the front of the enemy's works, and returned to a position northwest of Gettysburg, where we remained on Saturday, and Sunday morning commenced to fall back, and have now safely returned to the south bank of the Potomac, which we crossed on the morning of the 13th instant. In the battle of Gettysburg, I have to regret the loss of many valuable lives, among them Lieutenant J. Kent Ewing, killed. Among the wounded officers known to be in the hands of the enemy are Captain [W. P. F.] Lee and Lieutenants [John T.] Sayers, jr., [J. T.] Howe, and [R. J.] Glendy. It affords me pleasure to say that officers and men in this last battle behaved to my entire satisfaction, and displayed a coolness and gallantry worthy of a victory, though we were unable to win one. I will not attempt to specify any as most deserving of credit for good conduct, as I feel assured I could not do this with justice. It would be less difficult to name the unworthy. I hand in as a part of this report a list of the killed, wounded, and missing,

* showing 12 killed, 65 wounded, and 61 missing, embracing men and officers; total, 138. All of which is respectfully submitted.
