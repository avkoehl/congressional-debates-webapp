I expect General Stoneman back, and have ordered General Blair to start the moment General Stoneman gets up as far as Sandtown. Of course the report of Kirby Smith with his 20,000 is all nonsense. Bragg's arrival from Richmond must be to consult.

General McPHERSON,

Roswell:

I have heard from General Stoneman. He did not break the lower railroad, but burned a bridge over the Chattahoochee near Newnan. He will be in to-night, and I have ordered General Blair to move for Roswell to-morrow. You may, therefore, make all preparations to move out toward the Stone Mountain the day after to-morrow. Notify General Garrard to move in connection with you, sending his train to yours. That Augusta road must be destroyed and occupied between Decatur and Stone Mountain by you and General Garrard.

General McPHERSON,

Roswell:

What sort of a road do you find the Hightower trail? Do you find a road leading direct to Stone Mountain or to Decatur? If General Schofield moves straight on Cross Keys, and you so that your left is on Hightower trail, when across Nancy's Creek or the ridge between Nancy's and the Peach Tree, your centers should not be more than three miles apart. I would like you to find a road from about Buchanan's to the head of Snapfinger Creek.

General BLAIR,

Commanding Seventeenth Corps:

GENERAL: I have just heard from General Stoneman, who says he will be over at Sweet Water Town to-night. I have ordered him to hurry and relieve you. Haul out of sight all your guns to-night ready in the morning to move to Roswell. You can save much distance by coming by my headquarters and taking a road near the Chattahoochee, but the main Marietta road is plainer and easier for wagons and it may be is best. Choose for yourself. Do not go to Roswell town, but to the bridge or across where General McPherson is.

I am, sir, very respectfully, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.
