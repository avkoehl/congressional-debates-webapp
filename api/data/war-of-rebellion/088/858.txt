Colonel SHARPE,

Depty. Prov. March General, at Colonel Gates' Office, City Point, Va.:

General Meade has sent a battery to report to Colonel Gates. Retain the men now on board of transports until developments of the day are seen. General Meade is under the impression the enemy have left, their object being to obtain the cattle herd, which they have gotten. Fort Powhatan is believed to be safe, as also the Point. Captain Brown is on the way to get his guns. He can have them, unless when he arrives they may be wanted for defense. Retain for the present your provisional battalion under Lieutenant-Colonel Hardenbergh.

By command of provost-marshal-general:

A. J. DALLAS,

Captain and Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
