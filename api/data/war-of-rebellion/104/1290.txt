differences should be blotted out, and when you return home a manly, straightforward course of conduct will secure the respect even of your enemies. Whatever your responsibilities may be to Government, to society, or to individuals, meet them like men. The attempt made to establish a separate and independent confederation has failed, but the consciousness of having done your duty faithfully and to the end will in some measure repay for the hardships you have undergone. In bidding some measure repay for the that you carry with you my best wishes for your future welfare and happiness. Without in any way referring to the merits of the cause to which we have been engaged, your courage and determination as exhibited on many hard-fourth fields has elicited the respect and admiration of friend and foe. And I now cheerfully and gratefully acknowledge my indebtedness to the officers and men of my command, whose zeal, fidelity, and unflinching bravery have been the great source of my past success in arms. I have never on the field of battle sent you where I was unwilling to go myself, nor would I now advise you to a course which I felt myself unwilling to pursue. You have been good soldiers, you can be good citizens. Obey the laws, preserve your honor, and the Government to which you have surrendered can afford to be and will be magnanimous.

N. B. FORREST,

Lieutenant-General.

POST DEMOPOLIS, May 9, 1865.

Captain W. F. BULLOCK, Jr.,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Meridian, Miss.:

Cannot myself and staff be paroled at this post or at Selma without the necessity of going to Meridian, which to us will be very inconvenient and expensive? No Federal guard has yet arrived.

S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding Post.
