1864.
THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
33M
the letter of the honorable Secretary by any name
or epithet, but I will examine its statements,and
demonstrate that there arc throe great, gross er-
rors therein.
First, as to the amount of United States notes
in circulation. He says they have been dimin-
ished. I have in my hand an official statement
which came from the office of the Secretary of the
Treasury, I do not say in this city, but never-
thelessan official statementwhich corroborates my
statements. The circulation of legal-tender notes
on Api il 12,1864, without certificates of indebted-
ness, which are a species of currency, the circula-
tion of legal-tender notes alone, was $660,076,616,
an increase of $260,976,616 in legal tenders alone,
over what the Secretary of the Treasury promised
in December, and beyond that which my honor-
able colleague stated and indorsed, March 3. Add
$20,000,000 of fractional cur rency notes thereto,
and the legal-tender currency in circulation on
April 12, 1864, was $680,976,616'. The table of
legal tenders outstanding is as follows, and will be
found very interesting:

And now as to error No. 2. When this Con-
gress assembled in December last, theie was not
an interest-bearing Treasury note afloat. In
January no less than $50,000,000 were in circu-
lation, and on April 12, 1864, $211,902,900. Let
me not (despite what the Secretary writes to Mr.
Fessenden) be told that these interest-bearing
notes are not in circulation. Sir, they are. They
are the basis of the clearing-houses; they are
in your pockets, as members of Congress, for
your pay; they are in everybody's pocket; and
1 learn that they have been issued by millions
within the past week to provide for the payment
of the, Army of-the United States. On June 1,
when the coupons aie cut off, there will then be
§115,000,000 now accumulating, in lieu of the
original legal tender, liberated at once for circula-
tion, and swelling thus at once the volume of the
currency. These interest-bearing notes now are
here, there,everywhere, in every shypeand form;
and the inflation of prices since December last,
on everything which one eats and drinks and
consumes, fiom the luxunes of tea and coffee to
the necessities of life, such as beef, poik, and
bread, has been caused and stimulated in their
nominal value by this addition by the Secretary
of the Treasury of over §2^0,000,000 to the cur-
rency, beyond what the Secretary promised and
pledged in December last. Indeed, so severe are
now the prices of food and of clothing upon the
two and a half millions of the working people of
the country, the operatives, the day laborers, &c.,
that these people—men, women, and.children—
groan and suffer daily over the results. A severe
struggle has now commenced among the very
poor, such as never was known, before in this
country. The working classes pay sixty cents
per pound for butter, twenty-five cents for beef,
$3 50 per barrel for potatoes, twelve cents pet-
pound for codfish, sixteen cents per, pound for
mutton, twenty cents per pound for hams, and
sixteen cents per pound for pork. The range of
clothing is of the same inflat.ed character. House
rents are also advancing beyond the means of
labor to pay; and to what mainly may all this be
attributed? What but to this frightful expansion
of the currency?
Let us come now to error No. 3 in the Secre-
tary's letter to Mr. Fessenden, wherein he at-
tributes his own expansion to the expansion of
the Stale banks, and because of which, the wrong
he has committed, he would shift off upon them.
1 am quite sure if honorable members upon the
other side of the House had given this subject the
examination which 1 have, they would not put
faith in such letters as these from the Secretary
of the Treasury, but would seek out facts for
themselves. Inflation of the currency has not
been caused by the issues of the State banks. In
that great center of money circulation, in that me-
tropolis which I have the honor in part to repre-
sent upon this floor, the circulation of the Slate
banks is less than it has been for ten yeais. I
hold in my hand an official statement of the bunk-
ing department of New York, which shows that
fiom September 30, 1854, to September 30, 1863,
the total circulation issued and outstanding each
year was, in September last, $1,765,805 less than
in 1854.

1 hold in my hand another statement, which
shows that on the 26th day of September, 1863,
the real, not the yearly average, circulation of the
New York State banks was but $33,423,230, the
smallest amount of circulation that they have had
for years. Yet 1 am to be told that (he State
banks have been the cause of the presentinflation
of the cunency. Nothing is more untrue. No
chaige could be more unjust. Those banks" are
not my friends. In the good old times, when the
mass of the property of the country belonged to
the Whigs, I was associated with the great bank
interest and property; but they have separated-
from me because I would not go with them on
the subject of the abolition of slavery by force of
arms. And these bankers have not been my friends.
Nevertheless those men are patriotic. They are
men of foresight in mere business matters, and
when this war came, instead of expanding the
cunency they curtailed it, as I have shown.
Hence the passage of the resolution yesterday
against them, and censuringthem, and threatening
fo tax them out of existence, was injusticeand in-
gratitude of a cruel kind. It was a denunciation,
Republicans, of yourown friends, for Democrats
have not State banks, while the Republicans have.
The denunciation was of your own people, your
own friends,and 1 vindicate them here from your
aspersions as I vindicated you from the asper-
sions of the Republican press.
I see ihat the honorable gentleman from Penn-
sylvania [Mr. Stevens] is about to rise. I do
not know whether he wants me to restate what!
have said in reference to the State banks or to
repeat the interrogatories he put me the other day
against the New York banks. [Mr. Stevens
sitting down, Mr. Brooks continued.] I have in
my hand a statement of a bank presidcntin New
York in reply to his question the other day. I
submit it without comment now:
New York, Jlpril 16. 1864.
Dear Sir: Mr Stevens asserted that the banks of New
Yoik took $160,000,000 Joan, and paid 11/0,000,000 in gold
and $50,000,000 in currency. 7he facts are the:banks Ja
New York took only a portion of the $160,000,000, say
$105,000,000, the balance being taken'by the Boston and
Philadelphia banks. , '
Up to December 31,1861, Uiey had paid $87-,r>00,000 in
gold directly into the Trftasur.y, and daring the months ,of
January and Febiuary, 1862, paid $17,500,000 in -Old United
States demand notes, which afterwards sold at apremium
nearly pqunl to that of gold, so that in fact they paid ftlie
loans in gold or its equivalent. « t .
Respectfully, BANK PRESIDENT.,
Hon. James Brooks.
The amount of currency in the loyal Spates of
this Union now, issued by the State banks, is es-
timated by observing men conversant witb finan-
cial affairs at about $160,000,000. The very
highest of any estimate is $175,000,000. In all
probability it is much loss; because New Yd-tjc
has, as experience shows, one fourth of the cur-
rency of the Union, and multiplying her circula-
tion now by four, and the product will be much
less than $160,000,000.
That this basis of calculation upon the New
York banks is correct, is proved not only by the
experience of the past, but by the law of the domes-
tic exchanges; because if Pennsylvania or New
England or the West over issue even on legal ten-
der, unfavorable domestic exchanges would soon
compel them to curtail. But put the circulation
of the State banks as high up as $160,000,000,
that is all these State banks have been guilty of
since the suspension of specie payment, There
may have been other isolated persons engaged in
the banking business that have overshot the true
mark. There are dishonestly acting banks as there
are dishonest persons. There are banks which are
largely inflated; but upon the whole, considering
the sandy foundation upon which the State banks
have stood since the suspension of specie pay-
ment, their curtailment of circulation has been
wonderful; and they deserve a tribute of respect
from Congress and the Administration rather
than the denunciation to which they are exposed.
I have, however, sufficiently exposed the error of
the Secretary number three.
But what is the remedy proposed by gentle-
men to get rid of this $160,000,000 of State cur-
rency? Why, it is proposed to add to this, un-
der this new banking system, $300,000,000 of
paper money! In order to get rid -of $160,000,000
of State bank circulation, you propose to add
$300,000,000 of Federal bank currency^and there-
by, when you have destroyedall the State banks,
to inflate the currency $140,000,000 additional.
So when your system is complete, we shall have
$630,000,000 of legal tender and §300,000,000" of
the new bank currency, and the circulation of
the country will be $960,000,000; and that will
be the basis of the value of all the property of the
country! •
Now I call the attention of this House, of the
country, and of the Secretary of the Treasury to
this fact; and so far as my feeble voice of admo-
nition can reach them. I warn them that if they
do not curtail or lessen this expansion they are
approaching a crisis from which no success of our
arms can rescue the property and labor of the
country. There is no crime so great as issuing
an unnecessary and improper quantity of mere
paper as money, ltis robbery in Us worst aspect,
and it is radicalism and agrarianism in their most
destructive forms. Itunsettles not only the foun-
dationsof property and of labor,but of the public
morals and public character. It demoralizes men,
and thereby demoralizes all society. It creates
fraud, gambling, intoxication, moral, mental, and
physical, and thereby inflicts upon a people what
is worse than war, pestilence, or famine, in the
.name of property, then, in the name of labor, in
behalf of public morals, I invoke the Secretary
of the Treasury, fiom my place upon the floor
of this House, to curtail his expansion of the
currency, to fund the public debt, no matter at
what cost. He is not doing that by making money
plenty, in order to have his ten-forties taken at
live per cent, interest, because of some pledga
that no more six per cents, shall be issued, to
thereby keep up for these six per cents, their pre-
miums. But time is precious for the Secretary.
It is not too late for him even now to rescue his
name and fame from the infamy of John Law or
from the follies of the rebel Secretary Meiiimm-
ger, or, I was about to say, from the opprobrium
of Nicholas Biddie, who handled, however, only
the trifle of forty millions, while Mr. Chase ami
Mcraminger handle millions and billions and trit«
