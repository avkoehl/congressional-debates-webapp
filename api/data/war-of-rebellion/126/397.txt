Immediately on the receipt of your letter of the 26th December last, directing me to call in the chief quartermasters of General Sherman's army for reports of the operations of the Quartermaster's Department on the campaign from Atlanta to Savannah, I called on the chief quartermasters of the two wings and of the different corps for the reports. I have not as yet been able to get reports from either Colonel Conklin, chief quartermaster of the Right Wing, Lieutenant Colonel G. L. Fort or Lieutenant Colonel E. M. Joel, chief quartermasters of the Fifteenth and Seventeenth Army Corps.* My report would have been forwarded sooner had I not waited to get reports from these officers. I have finally concluded to make it without them. I will forward these reports as soon as received.

I inclose you a statement of captured and abandoned animals, marked A. I inclose also the reports of Major G. E. Dunbar, chief quartermaster of the Cavalry corps; Captain J. E. Remington, chief quartermaster (acting) of the Fourteenth Army Corps, and of Captain H. M. Whittelsey, acting chief quartermaster of the Twentieth Army Corps.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

L. C. EASTON,

Brevet Brigadier-General, Chief Quartermaster.
