HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Camp near Sharpsburg, Md., October 4, 1862.

His Excellency the GOVERNOR OF THE STATE OF Maine:

In view of the reduced and shattered condition of the Seventh Regiment of Maine Volunteers, the result of arduous service and exposure during the campaigns on the Peninsula and in Maryland, I made, on the 2nd instant, a special application to the War Department that the regiment should be sent to report to you in Maine, that it might be recruited and reorganized under your personal supervision. I yesterday received the necessary authority, and, as you will observe by the copy of Special Orders, Numbers 271, from these headquarters, inclosed herein,* I send the regiment to you for the purpose indicated, and I beg that when this purpose shall have been accomplished that the regiment may be ordered to report to me with all practicable dispatch. In returning this gallant remnant of a noble body of men, whose bravery has been exhibited on every field, almost, in the campaign cited, to the State whose pride it is to have sent them forth, I feel happy that it has been in my power to signify, even in this insufficient manner, my appreciation of their services and of their value to this army. And I will venture on the latter account to ask Your Excellency's best endeavors to fill at once their diminished ranks, that I may soon again see their standard in the Army of the Potomac.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, U. S. Army.
