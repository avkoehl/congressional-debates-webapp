of his high tiust, he alone has the power of re- '
moving them, and upon him alone should rest the j
lesponsibility foi their conduct, and the measures
necessary to ascertain their fidelity 01 unworthi    |
ness.     Congress is  the legislative  department,
whose province it is to enact laws, the execution I
of which then devolves on the Piesident     Con- 1
giess can have nothing to do with the functions j
and details of administration, the responsibility |i
of which rests on the President alone    A piop-
osition, then, making them sharers in that íe-
sponsibihty through a committee of their body,
t<o which  should  be  assigned  the  subordinate
and ministerial duty of "inspecting the affairs
and accounts" of sub Tieasureis, and repoi ting
" their defalcations to the Executive," I must te-
peat, appears to me utterly opposed to the pnn
ciples of the Constitution, and wholly incompat-
ible with the dignity of Congress    No, sn,even
if the occasion weie a legitimate one, we shall
never see, I trust, a committee of Congress re-
porting to any other bod y than to Congress itself
If the President will have sub Tieasuieis, he must
look after them by agents of his own    As much
as Executive power, I lament to say, has invaded
and .subdued the lofty spirit and ughtful inde-
pendence of the legislative department, we ate
not yet, I trust, prepared for a humiliation  of
appointing a committee of the American Congress
as a corps of beadles to hunt up defaulting sub- j
Tieasuieis, and report them to the Executive
That so novel and extraoidinary a measuie should
have been proposed by the President as a neces-
sary means of guarding the public money fiom
defalcation m the hands of sub-Treasurers, is the
most emphatic acknowledgment he could  have
made of the inherent insecurity of that system
Notwithstanding, however, all these admis-
sions, express or implied, of the supenor safety
and convenience of banks as depositonesand fiscal
sgents, the Presideut lecommends again the sub-
Treasuiy scheme to Congress, and even says his
opinions in favor of it " have been strengthened
Dy recent events!" What the President can find
in " recentevents" to sustain hisrenewed recom-
mendation of the sub-Treasury scheme, it utteiiy
surpasses my powers of comprehension to ima
fine Recent events, sir1 Let us, foi a moment,
[«quire what these recent events have been, and
how they bear on the two rival systems proposed
foi the safe-keeping of the public moneys First,
is to the system oi State banks as public depos-
itoues What is the testimony of íecent events
with regat d to them ' Have we not recently seen
them within fifteen months aftei a geneial suspen-
sion of specie payments, brought upon them by
an unprecedented combination of adverse en cum
stances, among which not the least was the hos
Ule policy of the Government itself—have we not
seen them, within this short period, without even
a cheering voice from the Goveinment amid the
difficulties which sui rounded tliem, lesuming their
payments in specie, meeting all their engagements
to the country with promptitude, paying many
uilhons to the Government punctually at the pe-
riods designated by law, and even anticipating,
oi some instances the payment of the small bal-
ances remaining, befoie they have become due
undei the provisions of law> So piompt a íecov-
ery, under cnuimstances of such peculiar difficul
ty and embanassment, is without example in the
financial history of the world, and afford the most
tnumphantevidence of the general soundness and
integrity of these institutions. The President
himself says " it is no more than just to the
banks" to bear testimony " to then honorable
course in the late emergency." The voice of the
recent events, then, of everything which has oc-
curred since the adjournment of Congress down
to the date of the President's message, is in favor
of the system of State banks as public deposi-
tories
Now, let us inquiie what is the verdict of these
same recent events on the sub-Treasury system.
For the last two or three months, the country has
been filled with consternation and alarm by suc-
cessive defalcations of sub-tieasurers, ranging
from twenty or thirty thousand dollars up to a
million and a quarter each' We have haidlyhad
time to recover from the shock of one of these ex-
plosions before we have been astounded by the
report of another and another. Almost every rank
and piofession of life has been invaded by, and
yielded to, the'"temptations" of this conupting '
system. Even hete, under the very eye of the
Goveinment, the shrine of the national honoi,lhe
Army, has not been aolc to resist the infection I ¡
refer with pain to these things, hut they have be-
come part of the public histoi y of the times, and
it is in vain to attempt to throw a veil ovei them i
Theiobes of the law (apiofession which the most
piofound and sagacious of all the foreign obseiv-
ers of our institutions has pronounced to be the
real aristocracy of the countiy) have been soiled
by the pollution The ptace and honot of fam-
ilies, as well as the pude of the nation, ha\e been
dtagged down to the dust by this system of ovei
whelming temptation and cotruption, while the
public treasure has been wantonly dissipated and
wasted by it. Deeply humiliating as these occur-
rences are to the national pride, I yet look upon
them as providential admonitions, intended to save
us fiom the thorough adoption oí a system which
1 verily believe, would spiead moie geneitl de-
moralization and coriuption through the land than
any which the arch enemy of man could devise
It is not suiely in such "recent events" as these
that the President can find any recommendation
of the sub-Tteasury scheme, which he again pio-
poses to Congress No, sir, be assuied that what-
ever party may effect hete, these same " recent
events" have forever sealed the fate of this sys-
tem with a virtuous and enlightened people.
Why, then, is it again recommended and uiged
upon us ? Is it as a lallymg cry of party > Is it to
drive through a party tnumph, fatal, as I fiimly
believe such a triumph would be in the end, to
those who achieve it' Are theie, then,Mi. Pies
ident, no circumstances of national exigency, ap-
pealing to the dormant, but I hope not yet extin-
guished spiut of patnotism, in which we can rise
supenor to this fatal bondage of party, and art
foi our country > Can we not, now that the tar-
nished honor and dilapidated interests of the na-
tion call upon us to close up every avenue of
corruption and abuse—can we not devote this
short session, at least, to the pressing wants of
the countiy, out of the many we have giren up
to the interests and conflicts of party > If we
could do so, nothing would be easier, in my opin-
ion, than to settle finally and satisfactorily this
gieat financial question which has hitherto so
much divided and agitated us. The circumstan-
ces of the moment are unusually propitious. The
scheme of a national bank is now, and I trust
finally abandoned The late happy and success-
ful íestoration of a sound currency by the State
banks, without the aid of such an institution, has
ptoduceda general conviction thatitcan no longer
be maintained on that gtound of necessity, on
which alone its advocates have heretofore rested
it The sub-Treasury scheme should, in my
humble judgment, be considered equally out of
the question It has over and over again been
rejected by the representatives of the people, and
the people themselves have ratified the judgment
of their íepiesentatives " Recent events" pio-
claim its condemnation in a still louder voice
What, then, remains? No other alternative than
the use of the State banks Let this be adopted
as the general principle, as it seems to me it ought
to be by all parties, in the present attitude of
things, and aftei the decisive expressions of pub-
lic opinion which have taken place, and there
would then be but little difficulty in solving the
subordinate questions as to the manner of using
them, never losing sight, however, of the cardi-
nal republican maxim that that use must be reg-
ulated by law, and not abandoned to Executive
discretion.
INTERFERENCE IN ELECTIONS
SPEECH OF HON. W. C. RIVES
OF VIRGINIA,
In the Senate, February 12, 1839,
On the bill introduced by Mr Crittenden to prevent the
interference of certain Fedeial officeis m Elections.
Mr RIVES said
Mr PiitfiDEVT. The subject now under con-
sideration is, m my humble judgment, by far
the most important in its bearing on the liberties
and future destinies of this countiy which has
occupied the dehbeiations of Congress for yeais
past, and is not suipaSsed in importance, in-
deed, by any which has ausen since the estab-
lishment of the Constitution, It concerns the
vital punciple of fieegovernment itself—the right
of the people fi eel y to choose their repiesenfa-
tives. Hitherto, m the theoty, at least, of all
parties, this great remedial right of the people
has been held to be sacied fiom all mteiference
on the part of the Go\ernment, or any pretension
of the agents of executive power to influence or
control its exercise But now, foi trie fiist time
in oui history, we have a solemn and elaboiate
ícpoitfrom one of the leading committees of this
body, (the Judieiaiy Committee,) boldly pro-
claiming it to be the right and duty of executive
officeis to busy themselves in elections, to en-
deavor to shape and direct public opinion, and to
influence and control the people, as far as they
can, m the highest and most important function
of their sovereignty
1 confess, when I listened to the reading of this
portentous repoit, some days ago,fiom the table
of youi Sccietaiy,! wasamazed and bewildered
I could not but ask myself, whither hath the mad
dominion of jiarty cairied us > Where am I, that
I heat such dortnnes openly proclaimed in the
Senate-house ' Am I in nee republican Ameuca,
the land of jealous constitutional fieedom, oi am
I in England, amid the " brooding darkness" of
the seventeenth century, undei the arbitrary and
lawless sway of the Stuarts, or am I in imperial
Rome, undei the soidid despotism of the Ca?sars >
I must say that nothing has ever impressed me
with so deep a despondency as to the foi tunes of
out young and glorious Republic as the doctunes
of that íepoit, received and welcomed, as they
have been¿ by a majority of this body.
I do not look upon it as expressing merely the
opinions of its authoi, or even of the committee
in whose name it is presented, but I am com-
pelled to regard it as the cieed of a party, as the
exposition and defense of a political system which
relies upon party organization, party discipline,
and official patronage, to control and govein this
mighty country It comes to us from a commit-
tee consisting (with but a single exception, I be-
lieve) of gentlemen of the same political party—
friends and supporters of this Admimstiation It
is no sooner read than it is hailed and openly ap-
plauded on the floor by one member of the party;
and another instantly moves to have ten thousand
copies of it printed for distribution among the
people, which is accordingly ordered without a
division A report, treating of such " high mat-
ter," and so sanctioned and indorsed by a ma-
jonty of this body, cannot fail to awaken the
most anxious attention to the character and tend-
ency of its doctrines
1 he honorable chairman of the committee, [Mr.
Wall,] fearing that his former political associa-
tions and opinions might by possibility prejudice
his report in the eyes of some, thought fit to in-
form us that a solemn council had been held on
his admission into the Democratic party, and by
that council it was deteimined "he never had
federalism enough to spoil his democracy " We
are to undeistand, then, that modern democracy
admits of an infusion of more or less federalism,
and, lfwe are to judge of theoithodox democracy
of the day by this íeport, I should say it admits
of a very large infusion, for I have never yet seen
the document which is more thoroughly saturated
with all the characteristic elements of the Federal
faith than this
Is it not an elaborate plea, throughout, for the
rights and pi erogatives of Federal executive pow-
er, for the influence of Federal patronage, not
merely on those who are its immediate beneficia-
ries, but, through their party services and elec-
tioneering activity, upon the great body of the
people themselves > While Federal patronage and
, Executive power are thus exalted, the State au-
1 thouties are studiously disparaged and held up
as special objects of jealousy and distrust     The
i functionaries of the States are spoken of habitually
j in connection with " the officers of the corpoia-
tions of associated wealth," evidently, as it would
seem, with the view of directing against them a
j portion of the odium which it has been the policy
I of the party to excite against the banking lnstitu-
