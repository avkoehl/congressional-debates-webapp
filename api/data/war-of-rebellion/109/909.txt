SPECIAL ORDERS, HDQRS. KINSOTN MILITARY DISTRICT, Numbers 18. Near Kinston, N. C., May 9, 1864.

I. Colonel G. N. Folk and Colonel J. N. Whitford, Sixty- seventh Regiment North Carolina Infantry, will immediately occupy with their commands, as far as practicable, the picket-line recently occupied by the Third North Carolina Cavalry, Colonel J. A. Baker, and will concert with each other the best plan for doing so. Patrols must be used for the purpose of connecting the more distant points, and will occasionally be sent down the roads by which the enemy might approach. The best scouts of the resepctive commandss will be used actively fort he purpose of gaining nformation. It may be presumed that the enemy will become more active in our fornt, and increased vigilance will be re\quired to foil him. Colonel Folk will report to these headuqarters the line determined on.

II. Colonel Whitfore will concet measures with the commanding officer at Washingotn, N. C., for conncting the left of his line of pickets with the right of the line of pickets detailed fromteh forces at Washington.
