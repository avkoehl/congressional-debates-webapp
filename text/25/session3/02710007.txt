otherprofession is most emphatically so m that of a
seaman, the self possession and skill required to
meettheexposures and dangersmcidenttoasea life,
both in peace and in war, can only be acquired on
the seas, the same consequences which result from
idleness and neglect, mi all other conditions of life,
will assuredly follow in this, and charged, as the
officer is, with protecting the property, as well as
defending the rights and honor of his country,
his incapacity is not less dishonorable to himself
than injurious to hei Unless, however, hiscoun-
try affords him opportunities of acquiring this
professional expeuence by often calling him into
active service, it would be unjust to complain of
his inability to perform these high duties, and it
is only when he declines these opportunities that
he can be fairly charged with being ignorant of
what he has never been permitted to learn
Experience has ateo demonstrated that it is only
by frequency of active service at sea, that the
otherwise unavoidable consequences of a long
peace can, in any degree, be arrested. All other
expedients will be found either entirely useless, or
only partially operative, and I abstain fiom sug-
gesting any material alterations in the system of
the service, not only for that íeason, but because
my limited experience in this Department has not
given m« sufficient confidence in my own opinions,
or, perhaps, entitled them to the consideration of
others.
There are other strong aud imposing reasons
for keeping up the present naval establishment of
the United States in full vigor and activity
The unremitting attention which, since the late
war with England, and the secrets it disclosed,
has been paid by the maritime powers of Europe
to the improvement and perfection of their ships
of war and of naval discipline, calls for awakened
vigilance on our part The position of the United
States, remote as it is fiom the bcene of European
nvalty, affords no immunity from its conse-
quences. Commerce makes neighbors of all na-
tions, and the conflicts of interest or ambition
between any two can scarcely fail of involving
many others Against such imminent contingen-
cies, an adequate naval force, keeping pace With
the commerce and resources of the country, well
manned, and, above all, well disciplined, is our
rnost effectual security, it is equally recom-
mended by its comprehensive sphere of action;
the facility with which it can be directed to dis-
tant and various points, and by its freedom from
almost all those objections which a wise people
so justly cherish towards great military establish
ments In addition to these considerations, it
comes recommended to the people of the United
States as the best guardian of their flag, wherever
it is carried by their enterprise, as well as by
having so laigely contributed to that fund of
national reputation, which being a common pos-
session, constitutes one of the stiongest bonds of
our Union

Report of the Postmaster General.
Post Office Department, )
December 3, 1838 \
Sir: The post routes of the United States in
operation on the 1st day of July last were, as
nearly as can be ascertained, 134,818 miles in
extent. The rate of annual transportation on
that day was about 34,580,202 miles, and its cost
¿3,131,308, viz:
Miles              Cost
By horse and sulky.......11 573,918   $831,028
By stage and coach.......20 593,192   1,889,792
By steamboat and railroad. 2,413,092      410,488
34,580,202 $3,131,308
This is exclusive of transportation by steam-
boats and other vessels, under the 5th and 6th
sections of the act of 1825, which costs about
$ 16,000 more
The lettings of the present year have been at a
considerable advance on former prices, except
those of the express mails, which have been at a
saving of about twenty-nine per cent.
To avoid danger of embarrassment from the
recent check on the revenue of the Department,
retrenchments and suspensions of serviee have
been made to the amount of §359,641 per annum.
Great care has been taken to make them in service
which was of the least value to the community
The report of the First Assistant Postmaster
General, herewith transmitted, furnishes interest-
ing details as to the mail seivice
On the 1st July last the number of post offices
was 12,519, being an increase of 752 during the
preceding year The number established was
1,104, and the number discontinued 352 During
the same year, the appointments of postmasters
were 2,068
The number of post offices on this day is 12,553
The number of contractors in service during the
last yeai was about 1,947 Of this number, 592
have been fined or had deductions made from their
pay, on account of delinquencies and omissions
The aggregate amount ot fines and deductions,
excluding remissions, was $67,128 54
The revenue of the Department for the year end-
ing June 30, 1837, was.........$4,100,605 43
The   accruing  expenditures were
about........................ 3,303,428 03
Excess of revenue...............   #797,177 40
The revenue of the Department for the year end-
ing 30th June last, is  estimated to
have been......................$4,262,145
The engagements and liabilities of the
Department for the same year were 4,680,068
Excess of engagements and liabilities .   $417,923
The surplus on hand has prevented embarrass-
ment from this excess of liabilities
Compared with the preceding year, the revenue
has increased about four per cent. This is an
unexpected and most giatifymg result.
The cash on hand on the 1st instant, was as
follows-
In banks, available, or expected to be so after the
1st January next.................$84,220 01
In draftofficesanddue from the Canada
post office.......................229,848 74
Total............................$314,068 75
It will be seen that the surplus funds of the
Department, which at one time exceeded $800,000,
have been greatly diminished
The deteimination of Congress not to reduce
letter postages, as suggested in my annual report
of 1836, was considered in the light of an instruc-
tion to apply the cash on hand, and the increasing
current revenue, to improvements of the mail ser-
vice. It was estimated that the seven hundred
new routes established in 1B36, and the impiove
ments of service on many old ones, in conjunction
with the usual annual inereabe of business in the
country, would add at least fifteen per cent to the
revenue of the last year, which would be mam
tamed with a still further inciease duung the
present year The extension of mail service was
accordingly carried far enough to consume this
anticipated increase, and also, m the progress of
a few years, reduce the surplus on hand to the
lowest amount consistent with the convenience of
the Department. The general financial disasters
of last year have not reduced the revenue, as might
have been expected, but have prevented most of
the anticipated increase, and thrown the Depart-
ment upon us surplus to sustain a large portion
of its extensions The indications now are, that
there will be a slight improvement in the revenue
of the current fiscal year over the preceding, but
not enough to produce any material effect An
advance somewhat greater may be reasonably
expected next year, but not great enough to meet :
the increasing cost of mail service, and put into l|
operation the new ioutes established at the last
session of Congress. It will hence be seen, that,
for more than a year to come, the curtailment,
rather than the extension of serviee, on routes
now m operation, is to be expected.
In general, the accounts of postmasters are ren-
dered, and the duties of contractors performed,
with the utmost fidelity and precision.   Indeed
the"world may be challenged for any similar estab-
lishment, embracing so much intelligence, activity,
and energy, and yielding to millions of mankind
so much unqualified good. The chief obstructions
which it has recently encountered in its career of
usefulness, have arisen from the deficiencies and
unreasonable demands of corporate bodies which
it had employed, or deemed it useful to empioj,
in the public service
In managing its funds through the public agents,
who are under bonds for then security, and re-
movable at will, and in dealing with the individual
freemen of the States and of the United States in
competition with each other, it finds all its opera-
tions easy, safe, and prospeious.
At their last session, Congress enacted " that
' each and every railroad within the limits of the
' United States which now is, or hereafter may be
' made and completed, shall be a post route, and
' the Postmaster General shall cause the mail to
' be transported thereon, provided he can have it
' done on reasonable terms, and not paying more
' than twenty-five per centum over and above
' what similar transportation would cost m post
' coaches "
To avoid further trouble w*th the railroad com-
panies on the mam mail lines, it was determined
to pay them, upon renewal of existing contracts,
the highest price which this law would admit.
But there was difficulty in fixing on that price.
In the first place, it was to be ascertained what
Congress meant by the phrase " similar transpor-
tation," and, in the next place, what that transpor-
tation would cost in post coaches. It was obvious
that they could not mean a transportation equal in
speed, for that would be impossible. They could
not mean the same transportation, or the transport
tion of the same mail upon the same route; for in
that case the word same would have been used
instead of the word " similar " It seemed proba-
ble that they had reference to the ordinary post
coach transpoitation in the same section of coun-
try, and to the points of similarity between that
and railroad transportation, intending the addi-
tional twenty-five per cent as compensation for
the increased speed. This construction would have
given the railroad companies as liberal a compen-
sation as they had a right to expect, inasmuch as
it would have materially inci eased the cost of mail
transportation, while, in respect to passengers,
produce, and merchandise, the cost is everywhere
cheapened by them.
But upon a careful consideration of the words
of the law, in connection with the mail service
existing at the time of its passage, the Department
felt itself constrained to adopt a construction more
favorable to the railroad companies. That the
word " similar" should be construed as having no
reference to speed, was a position which, accord-
ing to legal as well as just rules of construction,
could not be maintained From New York to
Baltimore, the great southern and western mails
are united in one At the latter point they sepa-
rate, one portion, believed to be the larger, going
West, and the other South It could not be
doubted that the transportation of the western
mill was, in its bulk, its Height, its importance,
and also its speed, more " similai" to that on the
mam southern line, than any other appertaining
to the Department The Department, therefore,
felt constiamed to take the cost of that transpor-
tation as its guide m fixing on the basis for the
allowance to railroad companies on the mam
southern line, provided for by law. The average
cost of this line, from Balumoie to Cincinnati,
was found to be $190 per mile To this sum,
twenty-five per cent was added, and the aggre-
gate, $237 50, was offered to the railroad compa-
nies between Fredericksburg, Virginia, and the
Hoanoke river, as the highest compensation which
could be allowed them by law The same rule
was intended to be applied to all railroads under
like circumstances It was not doubted that this
provision would be readily accepted as more ampl
than the railroad companies had a right to expect,
and that this troublesome matter would have been
forever adjusted, so far as regards those roads
But the proposal of the Department has not been
acceded to, and not only is a higher compensa-
tion demanded, but conditions are insisted on as
extraordinary as the concession of then* would ba
