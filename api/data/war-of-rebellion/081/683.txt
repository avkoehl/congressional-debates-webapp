BURKEVILLE, VA., June 23, 1864.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

The down mail train on the South Side Railroad approached Ford's Depot at about 6 p. m. The train was hailed by Colonel Lewis, of Dinwiddie, who informed us that the enemy were at Ford's. We backed about three miles, the sent forward a crank which did not return. Then four men on foot went toward Ford's. We gave them ample time to scout the railroad and report, but failing to do so the train was at once moved to this place. I could not learn the force of the enemy; only heard it was large.

R. G. MOSBY,

Major Fifty-ninth Virginia Regiment.

Colonel W. H. TAYLOR:

COLONEL:

All quiet in my front up to this hour. I am inclined to think that the report of Colonel Gary, stating that the enemy were crossing last night on the pontoon, much exaggerated. I will let you know the earliest moment I consider it safe to withdraw Cooke and Davis from this side.

Respectfully.

H. HETH,

Major-General.

PETERSBURG, June 23. 1864.

General BRAGG:

I observe in Northern prints that secretary Stanton tells General Dix that in the attack on our works at Petersburg on the 15th instant thirteen guns, several of colors, and between 3,000 and 4,000 prisoners were captured from us. The facts are that ten guns, many of them old, useless pieces, permanently in position on the lines, were taken. No colors lost. Our missing were 153. Total casualties, killed wounded, and missing, 238. Our total force was 2,200.

B. T. BEAUREGARD,

General.
