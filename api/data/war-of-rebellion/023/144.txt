General CRITTENDEN, Battle Creek:

Frequent reports some in of large forces crossing at and above Chattanooga. Can't you find some means of getting as the truth?

D. C. BUELL.

NASHVILLE, July 14, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

Murfreesborough taken. Ninth [Michigan] and Third Minnesota Regiments and battery captured. One thousand Texan Rangers reported at McMinnville. Reliable reports ar to the effect that this cavalry are followed by large infantry force under Breckinridge.

There is no doubt but that this section is in great danger. A portion of the enemy from Murfreesborough will bear toward Columbia and cut the communication between you and this place.

ANDREW JOHNSON.

HEADQUARTERS, Huntsville, July 14, 1862.

Governor JOHNSON, Nashville:

I am making the proper dispositions. What I apprehend is that our bridges will be destroyed at Franklin and Columbia. A very large infantry force them East Tennessee is not to be expected at Nashville. Ten thousand men might come.

D. C. BUELL.

General NELSON, Athens:

Use the train when it comes in and push with all energy. The troops at Murfreesborough surrendered at 4 o'clock p.m. yesterday. Do what seem fit when you can get forward, but report your movements. Take two batteries along.

General SMITH, Cowan, or on the road:

Starkweather is at Wartrace, Matthews at Shelbyville, and the Thirty-fifth Indiana marched from Fayetteville for Shelbyville this morning. If you move up to Wartrace it may be best, but I leave that to your judgment.
