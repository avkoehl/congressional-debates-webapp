I shall wait to see Captain Garvens, district quartermaster, who will be here to-night. I shall go on and overtake the staff, escort, and train to-morrow. Leavenworth thinks peace attainable without the campaign, but I will move as soon as possible into their country, recapture the stolen stock and property, and the men guilty of murder if it can be done. All is quiet on the road. I have prohibited all trade and interviews with the hostile tribes except the interview of Leanworth. We may not be able to cross Chapman's Creek, fifteen miles from here, for two or three days.
