Colonel A. V. COLBURN, A. A. G.,

Hdqrs. Army of Potomac, Episcopal Seminary, Alexandria:

I have endeavored to get some plan arranged and means procured for the most important part of our enterprise, viz a landing.

The only means we have now are the bateaux. These I had intended to go with Captain Duane's command and with McDowell's corps.

I learned to-day that the Annapolis bateaux had been ordered to Fort Monroe. The trestles, or the India rubber, or the canvas boats will answer for crossing these creeks and all the bateaux should be with the landing corps (McDowell's).

To-day I had a consultation with McDowell, and it was decided to place the whole matter of furnishing means of landing under General Woodbury, and to put temporarily Captain Duane under his command; to have the necessary scows, canal-boats, &amp;c., prepared immediately, and the bateaux are to form an essential part of the means. The orders have been issued by General McDowell for that purpose. Unless the arrangements are definitely made now it is out of the question to think of landing any considerable force as a tactical or strategical operation.

One company of duane's command might go with the land forces to put down trestle bridges-perhaps two companies-but he himself and all ;the bateaux should go with McDowell, and Colonel Woodbury will furnish the additional men necessary and see to the getting up of arrangements.

Answer as soon as possible.
