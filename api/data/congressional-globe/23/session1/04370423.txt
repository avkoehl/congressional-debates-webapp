by the charter, touching the matters referred to
them, and in theorder in which they are arranged
by the House of Representatives, viz
" I The cause of the commeicial embarrass
ment and distress complained of by numerous
citizens of the United States in sundry memorials
which have been presented to Congress at the pres-
ent session
" 2 Whether the charter of the bank has been
violated
" 3 What corruptions and abuses have existed
in its management, whether it has used its corpo-
rate powers or money to control the press, inter-
fere in politics, or influence elections, and whether
it has had any agency, through its management
or money, in producing the existing pressure "
" To these resolutions the following were offered
as ¡hi amendment by Mr. Ellsworth, and accepted
by Mr Everett
" Resolved, That the committee on behalf of the
directors of the bank be directed to submit to our
inspection, at then banking house, the books and
papers of the institution, as they shall be respect-
ively called for
" Resolved, That, m taking testimony, the com
nuttee will proceed according to t o«e general
lules of evidence which aie adopted in courts of
judicial inquiry
" The question being taken on Mr Everett's
substitute, with the amendment, those who voted
in the affirmative weie, Mr Everett, Mr Ells
worth, in the negative, Mi Thomas, Mr Mason,
Mr  Muhlenberg, Mr Mann, Mr Lytle "
This was a proposition held by two individuals
of the committee who afterwards agreed to the
unjust pretensions of the bank And under what
cncumstances was tnis change made' It was a
co-rimittee representing the power and authority
of the House of Representatives, and treating the
institution with íespect But the bank assumed
as the basis of its refusal, to question the honoi
and the motives of every member of the commit-
tee It assumed, as the basis of its refubal, that
the committee came to the investigation asapoht-
ua' party, not as a committee of investigation
Mr r. asked the honorable gentleman fiom Mas
Bachusetts, if the people of Philadelphia, or the
people of an y other part of Pennsylvania, wei e so
blind as not to see the cause of all these lefusals
and these pretexts If they weie so, they were
much more so than they had proved themselves
to be on ordinary occasions
Mr WEBbTERsaid he did not peiceive the
full applicability of the honorable member'b re-
marks It wasenougnfor him (Mr W ) to say,
that the bank investigation had nothing to do with
the Hamsburg Convention The laws were open,
and why did not the honorable gentleman fiom
Georgia advise a sen e facias, if the bank was guilty ?
Mr W said the question would go on to trial, if
the House of Repiesentatives chose, it was not his
business, but thens Whether thibmemonal was
like the one from New Jei sey, which was, presented
heie yesterday, depended on the facts and cir-
cumstances of the two cases Wei e the members
of that convention, or any pait of them, foimei
opponents of the Administration > These thirty
g( ntlemen would persuade the honorable member,
and all other gentlemen, of ti o truth of their lep-
resentations But when the facts were stated here,
we heard nothing but the bank and the monstei
Mr W íegarded the bank as nothing but an
instrument of Government, and yet the honorable
member from Geoigia raised it to the rank of a
department of the Government Mr W would
i ot agree that the bank was a party to the great
contest which agitated the countiy There was
no pirty in it but the people tl emselves They,
it was true, weie divided on the subject, but he
went on the ground that the people ot the United
States would correct tl e exist ng evite, believing
them to be competent to self government The
honorable gentleman, he knew, had very great
political sagacity—as much so a* any person he
knew in the United States, and .hegentleman said
that all the changes in Pennsylvania weie against
the bank It all came to this, that the oank was
a creature of Government, responsible to the law,
and if the distress was owing to a violation of its
chaiter, why did not the Government bring it to
trial' The gentleman argued as though it was
above the Government      If a íedrcss of public
grievances required that the bank should receive a
blow, why withhold it>
Mr FORSYTH replied, that he had only to
repeat what he had said yesterday, that he was
not an adviser of the Presiden t of tne United States
He would do his duty according to his opinions of
what was right and proper As to himself, Mr
r said he was not favorable to the issuing of a
scire facias, because it would but aggravate the
public distress The bank would expire in twenty
months, and all knew its power to protract a decis-
ion of the question until that period The honor-
ablegentleman from Massachusetts gave him great
credit for foresight and political sagacity, and he
was sorry he could not return the compliment to
the honorable gentleman He was a gentleman of
very extended views, but heretofore he had been
exceedingly unsuccessful in his predictions, at
least since he (Mr P ) had known him Let us
appeal to time, then, ard rest confidently on the
sagacity of those we appeal to The honorable
gentleman had said that the bank was complained
of as a monster, that it was the constant theme of
remark Well, the memorial from the Pennsyl-
vania convention concluded by praying relief by a
restoiation of the deposites to—the bank They
asked arecharterof—the bank And they prayed
Congress to adopt measures to curb the Executive
in his hostility to—what >—the bank The bank,
the bank, was the beginning and the end of the
theme But for the popularity and influence of
the bank m Pniladelphia, we never should have
heard of this convention The bank was not a
paity to it, but did not everybody know that it
was a powerful party in the countiy ' Did we not
know that everybody in the country who were
enlisted on that side were assailing the Executive
for daring to touch its immaculate deposites
Honoiable gentlemen might struggle to avoid Has
a party, but they must adhere to it asa party, and
nseorfall byit And who weie the mastei spirits
who had managed th ^gieatconcern > Theman
ageis of the bank, among whom was the distm
guished gentleman whose name stands at the head
of this committee, and who had always pui"ued
the most incessant, he might say vindictive, hostil-
ity towardb the Executive of the United S ates—
an individual who was a candidate for the second
office in the gift of the people, and in whose favor
the bank had pouiedoutits treasuies in lull stream,
and pouied them out in vain
Mr CLAY said the gentleman from Georgia,
who was a firm suppouer of the Executive, ad-
mitted that it was a question of change of agents
And it was that question It ought to be a strug-
gle for a change which should make principles
predominan t, and should cause the interests of the
people to be looked to and the mandates of the
Constitu'ion observed He was glad the question
of a successor was put by, and it was left for the
people to say who should ad minister thegovemment
of the country As to this convention, there was
no body of men in the country combining more of
ín'egnty and patriotism The gentleman from
Geoigia referred to the Globe, (a paper of which
he had not always spoken in the kindest terms,)
for contradictions of the reports of conversations
held by committees with the President Mr C
said, if reports weie to be believed, the President
could not have recollected what was said to him,
and it was un]ust to say that, because the people
of Baltimore misrepresented him, he would not
receive others from Philadelphia oi New Yoik
1 he convention was r ght, therefore, in saying that
he had denied access to him, and imposed condi
tions on them which he had no right to piescnbe
He had denied admission to his fellow citizens,
folding himself up in the Cast room,m all the
ostentation of eastern magnificence, saying, p-e
sent your complaints lr^writing,and I will answer
you The Lord Mayor of London would not
have done so to the cifzensof that city, the King
of England would not have daied to prescribe
such terms to his subjects
Mi BROWN said it was not without some
surprise he had heard gentlemen, who seemed to
approve the couise of the bank, assert their wil-
lingness for an investigation into its conduct How
little did this declaration, made at tui  late period
comport with their acts in the early part of the
present session It would be remembered tl at tne
honoiable Senator fiom Missouri [Mi   Benton]
had, at an early period of the present session in-
troduced a resolution in the Senate, proposing an
examination into the conduct of the bank, but
where then was the zeal of honorable gentlemen
for an investigation > They had had ample oppor-
tunity for its manifestation on that occasion, but
the Journals of the Senate would show that the
resolution to which he alluded did not meet even
the usual treatment required by parhamentaiy
couitesy. A motion for indefinite postponement
was made against it, by a Senator in opposition,
he believed, on the day after its introduction, which
was carried, chiefly by the votes of those in oppo-
sition to the Administration
Honorable Senators in opposition had, with an
air of triumph, asked why a sene facias had not
been íesorted to against the bank, and had defied
the friends of the Administration to resort to a
judicial inquiry into its acts Mi B said he
thought it would be difficult to suggest any course
which would receive the sanction of those who de
fended the bank To elude inquiry, and to defeat
investigation, seemed to be a primary object The
course of tne bank most clearly indicated that no
mode of investigation was acceptable to that insti-
tution It had been objected by it, that the Exec-
utive had no right through the Government direct-
ors to obtain information of its situation The cry
of Executive tyranny had been raised on that occa-
sion, and the Executive charged with having inva-
ded the sanctity of private accounts The House
of Repiesentatives had passed resolutions author-
izing a committee of that body to investigate the
condition and affairs of that institution This mode
of inquiry, the light to which is explicitly given in
the charter, and which has, on two other occa-
sions, been acquiesced in by the bank, without the
slightest objection, so far as he was irformed, had
encountered obstacles from the President and di-
rectors in the recent attempt to investigate its affairs,
which went effectually to destroy the power oi
Congress to examine into its acts, and was tanta-
mount to a declaiation of entire independence of
that branch of the Government Thus, it was most
appa>ent that no mode by which the bank is to be
brought to justice, will prove acceptable to ltr
friends, and when it had been said that a scire facts
was the proper íemedy, he was forcibly reminded
of the stoiyofa criminal offender, who, when suf-
fering the penalty of the law from the hands of the
officer of justice, thought one blow too high and
another too low The report of the Government
directors was thought to be an outrage by th«
friends of the bank An examination into its'
affairs by the committee was suddenly discovered
to be anothei great outrage, and now, a scire facia.
is said to be the only true and proper íemedy. If,
sir, (said Mi B ,) this course had been resorted to
by the President, or by Congress, the same clamor
about hostility asainst the bank,and an arbitrary
invasion of its lights, would, no doubt, have been
heard, which has almost deafened the ear of the
public for the last six months Mr B considered
tl is as a meie subterfuge, which was intended to
shekel the bank from the indignation of an insulted
people
Mr B said the honorable gentleman from Ken-
tucky [Mr Cl«li] had alleged, in justification of
the political alliance which was formed of such
heterogeneous materials, against the Administra-
tion , the example of the Allied Powers of Europe,
who had united their arms to effect the overthrow
of Napoleon It was true (said Mr B ) that the
paper system of GreatBntam had no doubt a pow-
erful agency in eorducting the allies to Pans, but
he ti usted that the unconq lerabl  spirit of the free-
men of this country would prevent theBank of the
United States from carrying the great political
allies, now snuggling for ascendency, in triumph
to the. American Capitol The vigorous spirit of
republican freemen was not so easy of conquestas
the subjects of old and decayed monarchs The
power of the Holy Alliance in Europe had been
constantly exerted to smother and crush the spirit
of freemen It was anameofevilomen,and should
warn the people of the United States against alli-
ances, cither holy or unholy
^The honorable gentleman had censured, in most
unmeasuied terms, the Pres dent of the United
States, for having declined any further interviews
vith committees
He believed that no Chief Magistrate in this
