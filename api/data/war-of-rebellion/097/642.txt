Colonel T. S. BOWERS,

A. A. G., Hdqrs. Armies of the United States, City Point, Va.:

SIR: I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of twenty-two sacks of rebel mail forwarded with your communication of the 5th instant.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. A. NICHOLS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,Piedmont Coal Mines, April 8, 1865-8.45 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Major-General Humphreys is following the enemy on the dirt road from this point to Appomattox Court-House. The difficulty in obtaining in advance knowledge of roads and the time lost in ascertaining the position of troops leads me to the conclusion time will be gained and a more prompt concentration can be made by keeping the Sixth Corps on the same road. I have therefore ordered Major-General Wright to follow the Second Corps. I shall be found on this road with the Second Corps. General Humphreys is satisfied that all of Lee's army was here last night. He thinks the infantry moved in the direction he (H.) is taking, having their cavalry on their right flank and their trains on their left. This is what he gets from the country people. The Confederate General Lewis is in our hands, being wounded.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

April 8, 1865-6 a. m.

Brevet Major-General WEBB,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy has left my front. I am moving in pursuit on the road running about west. Barlow's attack yesterday on the north bank of the Appomattox, near Farmville, and the movement toward this point of the other divisions caused the enemy to burn 135 wagons on the Farmville and Lynchburg road.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General, Commanding.
