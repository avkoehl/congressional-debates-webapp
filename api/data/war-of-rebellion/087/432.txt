General Griffin, with his division, beside holding our extreme our extreme left and repulsing the enemy there on the 21st, also sent re-enforcements on the different days to different points prepared to sustain them.

Colonel Spear, commanding brigade of cavalry from General Kautz's division, served me most capitally in watching my left and rear from August 22, scouting as far south as Reams' Station and west to the Vaughan road. Colonel Stedman's brigade, Gregg's division, also participated in the repulse of the enemy on the 21st, under Colonel Spear.

The position we have gained, besides fighting for three days and maintaining, we have our work rendered unassailable, and a portion of the corps is available for other service.

Respectfully,

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General, Commanding.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,September 1, 1864.

I have the honor to report that about 10 a. m. yesterday the enemy advanced a party about 150 strong to the vicinity of the Davis house, drove in the outlying picket near the signal station, capturing 8 men wounding 3, and killing 1, and causing the pickets to fall back a short distance. The enemy then retired. We hold the Davis house, but our signal station is much annoyed by the enemy's sharpshooters. There are 2,400 men at work daily on the deferens at this point, and 1,200 daily on picket, together with the details for camp guards and other necessary duties, makes the entire command on duty every other day.

G. K. WARREN,

Major-General.
