APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE
24Í
27th Cong-"-1st Sess.
Fiscal Bank—Mr. Smith.
Senate.   _
the case ot McCul och, vs. State of  Maryland, the
court says-
" Weadmit all must admit, that the powers of the Govern
merit ar° limited,  and that its limits are not to be tran
scended"
Again:
"Had it been intended to grant this power (to incorporate a
Bank) as one which should bs distinct and independent, to be
exercised many case whatevei it would have a place among
tile enumerated powers of the Government But being con
«áered merely ab a means, to be employed only for the pur
pose ofcattvmg into execution the given powers, there could
be no motive for particularly mentioning it"
The court is certainly entitled to a good deal of
credit for ingenuity, m conferring on Congress a
power by implication, and as an incident to'an ex-
pre s power, which was itself never granted    But
it cannot take even the humble place of a means
w hile it is m the hands of Congress,nor can it become
so until you separate it, and confide it to other hands
than Government functionaries, and then you may,
whenever separated,   uní e  it as well with one
power as another, and give it juti such ? charac-
ter as you please   A queer incident indeed ' Again,
the Court say, in the 4th Wheaton, 424    "To im-
pose on it (the Government) the necessity of re-
sorting to means which it   cannot control, (State
bank ,) which another Government may furnish
or withhold, would rendei i s course precarious,
the rtsu't ot its measures uncertain, and creatt. a
dependence   on o her go/erniaems.   which might
disappoint its most impirtant designs,  and is   in-
compatible with the language of the Constitution "
Did the  Court for„et, ihnt in confiding  it to the
hands of banker--, they   were   placing it beyond
the centre 1 of the Government, and oui of its reach,
and in hands at least as much to  be feared and
dreaded, provided the doctrine of vested rights, as
contended   for,   and   claimed   by the   court   on
another occasion, in the same book, is to be relied
upon?   To sustain the opinion, that under an im-
plied power, or incident to some express   power,
the wisdom   to ascertain  which power it be!on ed
to no one spems to ha<e  possessed  the court   as I
have beiore o i-erved   Mr   President, fortifipd lt-
seif with several  supposed analogous case*, which
I said did not suppon the princij les the court laid
down, but on the contrary disproved them; one of
which I refer to, in the 4th of Wheaton's Report,
417, where the court say • "Take, 'or   example,
the power to establish po t offices and post roads
This power is execu'ed by the single act of mak-
ing the   establishment    But from this has been in
ferred the power and du*y of carrying   the mail
along th" po t road, fiom one pos   office o ano
ttier.   And, from   ibis implied po^ver, has again
been inferred the right to punish ¡ho^e who steal
letters from the   post   office,   or   rob the mail"
Another of tie «upposed analogous cases presented
by the court, I n fer to in the same volume of re-
ports, page  423     Th<" court sa,    "The propriety
of this, rema & would   seem to  be generally ae
knowledged by the  universal acquiescence in the
construction   wlucti   has been uniformly  put on
the 3f fee un of the 4ih article of the Constitution
Th« power to "make a'l  needful rules and regu-
lations respect ng  the territory or other property
belonging to th- Ui ited States," is not more com-
prehensive than the power "to make all laws w^ rb
shall be necessary ?nd proper for carrying into ex-
ecution" the  powers of   the   Government.   The
court here  again «eem to forget, in the cases they
exhibit, these  laws were trade under  the implied
powers to carry  into   effect  the express powers
Who ever deiie 1 this"! But o make th ca>es ana-
logous,  and   by them  fortify  the  opinion of the
court, the ei«e   which the court puts, should have
bten grants of franchises, compartes incorporated,
and instead of carrying into effect   the   express
powers, by the aid of («tos executed by proper Go-
vernment   functionaries,  they shruld  hive been
confided to certain individuals, made wholly inde-
pendent    of     the    Government   and   the    peo-
ple, .by    a contract   and    vested   rights    The
cases   would    then   have   been   analogous    1
should    like    to    see    these    powers   under-
taken to be carried into effect by the aid of incor-
porated companies, under a charter from Congress,
sanctioned by the Supreme Court, and the indi-
viduals incorporated with vested rights, beyond the
would be a grand spec ac'e    And certainly not
moie prepo&terous, and absurd would it be,,,than to
see the great, and  most imporunt power in  the
Government, making and establishing a currency
for this great country, m the hands and under the
control ot irrespons ble individual , and  «ho may
be  as well ^¡reigneis   as citizens of   the Utu
ted S ates.   Foreigners owned two thirds of the
late  United States  Bank, and they rray own  as
much or more of this    Then not only our currency
will be in the hands of foreigners, butour Treasury
and  treasure will be also, for the  Bank i,  made
the    Treasury,   and    the    bank;, of   course   the
treasuiers.   This is not fancy, it is reality   Under
such circumstances  a majority of the Stock being
own ed by British«ubject*, we should be m excellent
condition to bui'd and maintsm a navy—to raise
and maintain an army to fight Great Britain, should
we oe at viar with her    Some contrivance must
be had, to obviate what seemed to be an insupera-
ble difficulty,  the  want of sovereign   power in
the General Government to create a corporation;
and the couit paved the way, by a very ingen'ous
device—that k, that to grant charters of incorpora-
tion,  was not one of the great substantive ends of
Government    Though  to grant one,  the   court
was forced to admit thatit required theaid of sove-
reign  power,  which, it was also forced to admit,
had never been granted for that purpo e to the
General Government     It was th*refore concluded
that the power to create a corporation mi<ht be
found luiking in an implied poner   an incident
of some express power     I ssall, Mr President,
before I conclude, show the utter absurdity of ibis
proposition
An incident of some express power, must par-
take of the same character as theexpress power
to which it beiong* The object ot a bank is to
create a currency, deprive it of his featere, and
it would not have a fr end left Pvt ihe lnridrnt
along with the power, than, to which it belongs,
and it would conflict with the power to ctin money
&c which is the constitutional currency—hence,
ihe necessity frit by its friends, to detach it, and
convey it away to individuals, because it could not
be bel 1 andexirci ed by the G vern<n >it
It is claimed, Mr   President, that  the Constitu
tion has revise 1 a judicial conMru"tion, and that the
que tion is settlpd in favor of tne power in Congress
to chatter a  bank.     And  some «eer-i to  impute
such saciedness  to the opinion of the court, that
they treat it as asacrtlegious offence to doubt i s in-
fallibility.   It would b  asuffie'pnt answer to 'ha',
to  say   that "Congress i  a co-ordma e blanch of
the Government, and has  a i ¿ht to j idee of the
consuiututioual powers, rs well &■* the Juoicury "
But, Mr  President, I desire  to oxamir" the judi
cial power of cur Government, and ste how much
influence i s decisions ought to*have with the sove-
reign    people,   who e    servaat  it  is,  or    hould
be,    upon   a   vi al    ínteres'    of   theirs      We
have    heird   much    Sdid    by    the    advocates
ot   judicial    infallibility    and  precdent    about
the importance ot judicial independence   No man,
Mr  Preside it, is a more strenuous advocate of j a
dicial independence  than I  ¿m    No one is more
sensible of its importance than  I am.    But I find
those who are the mostclamorojsforit,are in reality
opposed to it, and will be the  last  to suoport it
What is judicia'independence1 Depender ce upon
the sovereign power, is the onl^   species of inde-
pendence, ot which judicial pi   el  s capable     If
it is depnved  of this  independence, i    b cones a
dependant of   •-ome  omer   power       I   spLak of
this as the natural result of the pnnc pie  applica
ble to it     Th  independence and strength of pow
er in ever} section of our political system, will be
found proportionate to their dependence on tne sove
reignty,   the people      Xbis is  equally applicable
to all the departments of our Government, thp Le-
gislative, Executive, and Judicial, though thi Jam
I  cía), f om  its  peculiar structure, can hatdly take
j  the elevated position of a pohtital power, notwith-
standing it was designed it should     In the princi-
ples of division and responsibility to thp sovereign-
ty, originated the idea of one pohtical agent being
independent of another.   This is a vital principle
m our polity, and not to  be disregarded, Lut to be
control of Congress or the people.   I thmkthis ¡i adhered to with the most sciupnlous regard.   It
16
may be observed, then,-that the dependence of one
agent on an other, would be an accumulation, and
not a division of power, and power is not made re-
sponsible by its accumulation.    The people, for
whose benefit all Government machinery is de-
vised, would be sarer with sovereignty m the Le-
gislature than the Judiciary, because the Legisla-
ture is responsible to them, while the Judiciary is
is not.    Each depaitment of the Government, if it
is perfect in its structure, will act m subserviency
to the will of the people     All are instruments te>
promote  their  welfare and  interest     If the Ju-
diciary was so constructed as  to act m harmony
with the other departments, smd be responsible to
the people for its acts, it is undoubtedly calculated
to act as a corrective upon the legislative action,
and to redound to the welfare of the people     We
come to the question now, Mr. Piesident, whether
tur Jad ciary have these   attributes oí indepen-
dence I h ve supposed necessary, to give it the
weight and influence with the people, many have
contended for, and supposed it ought toíuve It may
not be unprofitable  to inquire whether the   ju-
dicial power, is, in its character, political or mu-
nicipal, if of tne former, it would be entitled to a
different consideiaam than if ot the Utter, if it
strictly belongs to neither, we must «nil see, from
its peculiar structure, what weiaht and influence
its opinions ought to have with the sovereign peo-
ple, whose instrument it is.    An emanation from
the sovereignly, and  independence of any other
department, are attributes oi   a political depart-
ment    Municipal department is a mere creature
of the law, and its whole powers prescribed by it,
and ones to it entire obedience    The  power and
slreiigth of the «gent, depend upon the confidence
the sovereign has in it, and the confidence the sove-
reign, the people, have in ihe agent, ihe Judiciary,
will be just in propottion to the agent's re ponst-
