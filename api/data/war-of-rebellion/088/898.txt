few stragglers and a few broken-down cattle was all the enemy's left behind. I drove a small rear-guard from Cook's Bridge, on the Blackwater, to the plank road, where I was opposed by some force. I thought it, possible that it might be your forces that I was engaging in the night, and not being able to ascertain the fact positively, I fell back a mile or two and remained till morning. I then sent to the plank road, and not finding either your forces or the enemy I returned. I had less than 500 men, and only about half of these and carbines.

Very respectfully,&amp;c.

GENERAL: Your note* has just been received. The right of my line is near Davenport Church and extends to Cocke's Mill. I will send a report of the raid as soon as I can get the data.

(Received 11.10 p.m.)

Major-General BUTLER:

I deem it proper to inform you that General Kautz has just reported information derived from citizens which would lead to the belief that the enemy's cavalry in force is on the Blackwater. A scouting party from Sycamore Church met ten or fifteen rebels a few miles from that place. I have directed a cavalry reconnaissance in the morning, but send you the above, all that is known, as a dash on Fort Powhatan may be designed. No other indications of movements but the above.
