I noticed a great many fat cattle in Loudoun, which indirectly find their way to the rebel army. Allow me to suggest the propriety of seizing the same for the benefit of the Government. I traveled the by-roads almost exclusively.

I returned to camp because my rations of bread were exhausted, and the major part of my horses shoeless; as soon as they are shod, which requires a few days, I will be pleased to return to Loudoun in quest of the guerrillas who have infested that section for so long a time, if it meets with the approbation of the general.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY A. COLE,

Major, Commanding.
