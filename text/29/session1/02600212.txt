THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. 16,
the late war, let us wait till Great Britain falls into
a state of decrepitude: then would we have lost
all the glories and advantages of the contest that
ensued. It was a policy that would subject us to
the contempt of the world and to self-degradation.
Peace had charms, and war, horrors. He delighted
to contemplate the blessings of peace. But if the
country belonged to us, did not the spirit of our
fathers call upon us to maintain our rights to it?
Gentlemen argue that we must wait, or wo must
have war. Let us try negotiation a^un, they said;
but negotiation has been tucd in vain, and the only
«:oui ye was, to &ivc the notice, which would compel
Great Britain to make more arrangements for the
adjustment of the question.
Had not this negotiation baffled all the skill of our
eminent statesmen2 Had it not been tried by Mr.
Clay and Mr. Calhoun, and more recently by the 1
present very able Secretary of State? Had not all '
attempts at negotiation failed? When Lord Ash- !
burton came here, the question, it was said, w as to ;
be settled. But he was content with the fame and i
the laurels which he won in the Northeast, and he !
left it to others to win fame and laurels in the North- '
west. It was then said, do not <rivo the notice; he ■
sjlent till negotiation ha<s been tried. Mr. Paken- :
ham came to settle the dnlicuhy, and then, a-^ain, ,
it was said, do not move ui the matter, be mIou!,
for the negotiation is pending. I'ut nothing had
resulted from the negotiation. 1 believe (said Mr.
D.) that justice, p)od policy, and even public
laith, demand that we should cive this notice, lie
believed that it would promote peace,; for, if we
gave it, the sense of the whole world would de-
mand th.it Croat Britain should concede to u^ our
just rights. The puny that cned out so vehemently
for peace, proposed more uncompromising means
than we did. They (said Mr. I).) propose to ta\e
Oregon by peaceable means, up to 54° 40'. Did
that look like peace? "Was it. not telling Great '
Britain that wo were determined to have the whole
of Oregon or none? i
It was said that we were not prepared for war.
Does u republic evei prepare for war? It was eou- j
trary to the genius of our institutions to maintain ,
standing armies and large fleets for purposes of 1
war. But our fortifications were found in the free- j
man's breast. All we had to do was to let the peo- j
pie know their rights, and they would maintain j
them. For all the reason? wlueh he had  iven, lie ,
was induced to vote for the notice. If war come, ]
we cannot help it. Vv'o should be subjected, in
that event, to some haulships and distresses, but |
tiicy would not Ij^t long. As m die late war, so
in tins—a host of able and victorious commanders 1
would rise up, like Jackson, } rown, and Scett, on ,
the land, and Perry, Hull, and lJecatur, on the
w?a. Has our spiut become so weak and sub- 1
tlued, and our blood so pale, that we cannot deft-ad :
ourselves, as in the days of our predecessors: Our .
success in the comlict, lie believed, would he inev- ^
itable. Expressing his regret to differ from gentle- :
men from tie South for whom he enteitaincd the ,
highest respect, lie o^am urged that we should i;ive !
the notice; and he would d<>M.' his remark* by say- j
ing to every member of this body, ;
" lie just, and fear not; ;
Let all the euds thou aim'st at he thy country'*, :
Thy God's, and truth';*. Then, if thou fuilVt, ,
Thou OtUVta blessed maihr.'' ;
When Mr. Dgubi\* yielded the floor, it was ob-
tained by Mr. Pvo<-,ms i:ll, of Connecticut; on;
whose motion the committee rose.

CONTESTED EJECTION FROM FJ.ORIDA.
Mr. HAMLIN, chairman of the Committee on
i Elections, rose and said, it would be recollected
i that he had, some days since, given notice of his
I intention to call up the case of the contested elce-
j lion from Florida to-day. He had now risen for
1 the purpose of saying, that he did not propose to
| call up that case to-day. And he would take this
j occasion to say, that when he had given this no-
; tice the other day, he did not know, nor did he be-
j lieve any individual on the committee (with'one ex-
ception) knew, that the sitting member was absent.
He (Mr. B.) had not learned this fact until last
evening. lie understood, however, that the gen-
tleman proposed to return this evening. The mat-
ter had now been delayed a number of days. He
should propose to take it up at the earliest period
after the gentleman's return. If he returned to-
