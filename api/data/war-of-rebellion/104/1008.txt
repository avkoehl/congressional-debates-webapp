Commanding at La Grange:

I am directed by the general commanding the cavalry to say that he considers your regiment sufficient, by a careful distribution in companies and detachments of companies, for guarding the railroad line from White's Station to La Grange, and he expects you to relieve the Fifth Illinois Cavalry along that line, replacing the posts and stations they occupy by men of your own regiment. He expects you to see	 that the Fifth Illinois Cavalry is in readiness to move into this city for embarkation at any moment, bringing their dismounted men and supplies on the cars and marching the mounted. All surplus ordnance stores will be in readiness to turn over at this place, and all worn-out and other unserviceable public property will be inspected by the brigade inspector and condemned.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. C. SEYMOUR,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.
