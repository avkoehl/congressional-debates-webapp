Mr. BIDAVELL. This is the bill which lias
"been before the House two or three times, and
after being sent to the Committee on Public
Lands was reported upon favorably. I now
call the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
Mr. KASSON. I wish to inquire of the gen-
tleman from California whether the provision
of tho socond section of the substitute is in-
tended to prohibit the United States from
allowing preemption on its own lands. I will
read the clause to which I refer:
And thcsections and j>artsof sections of land which
shall remain in the United States within the limits
of the aforesaid grant shall not be sold for less than
double the minimum price of public lands when sold,
nor shall any of said lands become subject to sale at
private entry until the same shall have been first
offered at public sale to the highest bidder at or above
the minimum price aforesaid.
Mr. BIDWELL. The objection of the gen-
tlemah from Iowa as obviated by an amend-
ment of the Coinmittee on Public Lands.
Mr. HOLMES. The Committee on Public
Lands have stricken out the latter portion of
the clause which the gentleman from Iowa has
read. The language which they have stricken
out is the following:
Nor shall any of said lands become subject to sale
at private entry until the same shall have been first
offered at publicsaletothehighestbidder at or above
the minimum price aforesaid.
This amendment obviates, I think, the objec-
tion of the gentleman from Iowa.
Mr. KASSON. The gentleman's explana-
tion is satisfactory.
The substitute was agreed to.
The bill, as amended, was ordered to a third
reading and read the third time.
The question being on the passage of the bill,
Mr. BID WELL called the previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered ; and under the opera-
tion thereof the bill was passed.
Mr. BIDWELL moved to reconsider the vote
by which the bill was passed; and also moved
that the motion to reconsider be laid on the
table.
The latter motion was agreed to.

RETRENCHMENT.
The SPEAKER announced the following

A. Jenckes of Rhode Island, Samuel J. Ran-
dall of Pennsylvania, and John L. Thomas

adjournment of congress.
Mr. STEVENS. I rise to a privileged ques-
tion, and submit the following resolution:
Resolved, (the Senate concurring,) That when Con-
gress adjourns it will adjourn to meet again on Satur-
day, thclstdayof Deeembernext, unless sooner sum-
moned by the Presiding Officers of both Houses, which
power, in case of emergency, is hereby granted to
them.
Mr. FINCK. I rise to a question of order,
and submit that this resolution cannot be enter-
tained as a privileged question, because it goes
beyond the matter of adjournment and pro-
poses by this legislation to confer upon the
Presiding Officers of the two Houses new pow-
ers not now authorized by any law.
Mr. RANDALL, of Pennsylvania. Under
the Constitution Congress cannot, meet at any
other than the regular period named in the
Constitution, except on the call of the Presi-
dent of the United States, or in pursuance of
a law duly approved by him.
The SPEAKER. The Chair will state, in
reply to that point, that the President of the
United States has power to convene Congress
at such time between the regular sessions as
he may deem fit. But the Chair is of opinion
(although this is a new question) that if the
two Houses take a recess they can authorize
their Presiding Officers to call them together at
an earlier day than that which they have named
for their reassembling. It is equivalent to an
indefinite recess. The Constitution allows Con-
gress to adjourn for any period exceeding three
days, both Houses concurring therein, and de-
clares that resolutions of adjournment shall not
be sent to the President.
Mr. STEVENS. As several gentleman desire
that the morning hour shall commence, and as
a number of members desire information in
regard to this question, I move to postpone
this subject until to-morrow immediately after
the morning hour, and that the resolution be
printed.
Mr. HARDING-, of Kentucky. Can this
resolution be introduced without unanimous
consent?
The SPEAKER. The Chair has decided
that it can, as it relates to adjournment.
Mr. HARDING, of Kentucky. Isitaprivi-
leged question?
The SPEAKER. It is.
Mr. FINCK. My point is that it confers
additional power upon the Presiding Officers
of the two Houses.
The SPEAKER. The Chair has overruled
that point ot order, on the ground that, as the
two Houses can take a recess, it would seem
that they may authorize their Presiding Offi-
cers to call them together before the expiration
of the time fixed for the recess. For instance,
the House might, on taking a recess from Thurs-
day till Monday, authorize its Presiding Officer
to call them together on Saturday, if any exi-
gency should require it. If one House could
do this, may not both Houses, when taking a
longer recess, if they concur? Both Houses
could, uuderthe Constitution, resolve roadjoura
till the first Monday of next month, both Houses
concurring, and if a quorum was then present
eould adjourn similarly throughout the recess,
from month to month.
Mr. FINCK. I do not know that the Chair
