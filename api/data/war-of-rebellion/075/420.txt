HEADQUARTERS TWENTIETH CORPS,Near Allatoona Creek, GA., June 6, 1864-1.30 p.m.

Brigadier-General WHIPPLE,

Chief of Staff:

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that I have established my corps on the line indicated by your instructions of the 5th instant. In consequence of the imperfect character of the instructions and the errors in the map accompanying them, I find the shortest practicable line for me to hold will not be less than two miles and a half; this with the smallest corps in the army. Converging to my lines are the roads from Lost Mountain, Powder Springs, Marietta, and Big Shanty, embracing the entire front of the rebel army. I can find nothing connecting with my right on Allatoona Creek. It is reported that the left of the Twenty-third Corps is one mile and a half in rear of it. I request that the officer in command of the Twenty-third Corps may be ordered to connect with my right. My pickets are confronted by the rebel picket along my whole front. My headquarters to-night will be in the vicinity of the McLean house.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General, Commanding.
