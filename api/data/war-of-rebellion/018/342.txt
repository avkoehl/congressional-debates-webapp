HEADQUARTERS DIVISION,June 5, 1862.

Colonel E. SCHRIVER,

Chief of Staff, Army of the Rappahannock:

SIR: Colonel Allen has just reported to me that the wagon-road bridge was swept off about 3 o'clock a. m. and the railroad bridge about 5.

I am, sir, respectfully, &amp; c.,

E. O. C. ORD,

Major-General of Volunteers.

HARPER'S FERRY, June 5, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

The bridge was swept off last night; also the trestling on the Winchester Railroad, about a mile above here, preventing the train running to Winchester. General Sigel's division has five days' rations. We have on this side of the river 60,000 rations. The river still rising.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry.

HARPER'S FERRY, June 5, 1862.

Honorable SECRETARY OF WAR:

An officer just from Opequon reports bridge safe, and that stream falling. Will pass over it to-morrow. Subsistence for Crawford's brigade at Martinsburg and Best's new battery. Trestle-work at Back Creek gone; also at Great and Little Cacapon. Can't hear from Sleepy Creek. River falling west of Martinsburg. It is very high here. Store-houses and stables flooded; also lower story of arsenal on the island. Stores saved. Will report other bridges as I hear of them.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry.

HARPER'S FERRY, June 5, 1862.

Via Wheeling, 8.30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Further intelligence from the west says Little Cacapon Bridge is repaired. Timber sent for repair of Great Cacapon. Patterson's Creek Bridge safe; secured by a loaded train of coal cars. The bridge at Opequon will be in order with a few hours' work. Workmen will, as soon as the Shenandoah falls, be sent on the Winchester Railroad - the agent thinks in three or four days. So soon as it and the main stem is repaired it ought to be guarded. The Fifty-fourth Pennsylvania is now on the road from South Branch to Back River, and the fragment of McGowan's company at Opequon, protecting stores and bridge, the only troops on the railroad west of the Potomac.

D. S. MILES,

Colonel Second Infantry.
