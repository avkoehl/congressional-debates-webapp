WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington City, D. C., August 12, 1862.

Governor ANDREW,

Boston:

You may go on and make requisitions for your militia. But they ought not to go into camp, but come directly here, where they may relieve good troops while being themselves instructed. Their presence here might turn the fate of a battle. I would gladly place the bounty and pay disbursements in your hands, as you have several times requested, because I know your energy and have unbounded confidence in you, but existing laws forbid it. I can only place the money in the hands of an officer in the service for disbursement. I shall be happy to give you carte blanche whenever it can be done.

EDWIN M. STANTON.

SAINT PAUL, MINN., August 12, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

Can we furnish, if we see fit, our quota, not only of volunteers but of drafted militia, by volunteering, so as to avoid a draft? Also, can we be permitted to continue to receive volunteers until we are ready to draft - say about September 1 - as all our people are now in the harvest field, and are indispensably necessary to the gathering of the crop? Answer at once.

OSCAR MALMROS,

Adjutant-General.

WINONA, MINN., August 12, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

If possible, pray postpone drafting in Minnesota fifteen days, by which time I am confident quota will have volunteered. Harvest is suffering greatly for laborers. Please answer.

WM. WINDOM.

ALBANY, N. Y., August 12, 1862.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

The great activity of recruiting in several districts has caused the regiments to reach as high as 1,500 and 1,600 men. Can I accept them as regimental organization, giving them another major?

E. D. MORGAN.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

Washington, D. C., August 12, 1862.

His Excellency E. D. MORGAN,

Governor of New York, Albany:

How soon will the New York troops begin to move to Washington? Can you send any to-day?

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.
