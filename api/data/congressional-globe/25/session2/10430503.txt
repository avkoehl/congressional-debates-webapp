A id, besides ad lhi-, sir, who that contemplates
the subject, who that has contemplated it, can
doabt the correctness of the position, so often de-
fended w nen defence was not necessary, and so
often nesiefted when defence was needed, that it
is the dnty of statesmen to legislate m that way
which shal1 elrect the greatest good for the greatest
number' Sit, for one, I cannct, although I am
not disp s >d to deny that the minority has rights
that should riot be disregarded, or the soundness of
the views which have elicited these incidental ob-
servations.
The public domain is on of the principal sources
of the wealth oi a nation. As such, it is regarded
on all sides, and the man is yet to be found who
is so unsound in mmdl and impolitic in action, as
to dream of placing it, either in mass or in parcel,
10 the hands of speculators, or at the disposal oí
monopolizing corporations, at the same lates of
price which die received at the hands of the hardy
yeomanr'. I¡ thi^ proposition be admitted, (and
it is not do6bied,),there can be no better mode adopt-
ed oi conceived lor the dsposition of the public
lands than that which is embraced in the bill now
beioie the House, njr, sir, do I presume that the
policy of the bill, a> is contended by some, will be
to throw the whole public domain at once mlo the
maikei a result tint uould, and should, be de-
precated at once by every practical statesman, as
it would be attended by tro evils, at least- rrat,
your land vouldbe immediately rnonopoli7ed be-
yond a cioubt, and the injurious consequences of
such an is-ue awit be odvious lo all, and t ¡e foot
is so pa' idb'e, that it &<rnotbe npcessaiy to spend
a word in dr-iuosing iht proposition; secondly, it
«juld cr< <* r redundancy in )oar public coff"is,
«h'c'n o deodinP scramble andquarrel fontsd's-
tnbo'i n Again the spiritof ihe times d es not re-
quire, nor uouldit sanctioi, co large a surplus, and
the rejection ot the proposition would be susiamcd
by the m">t able and unanswerable arguments.
The interests of the country generally, but more
particularly the manufacturing community, would
notdesir" to see ¡his branch of the revenue supply
the wh 1" demand for th<i support ot the Govern-
ment Sir,! need not =ay to this House that the
tariff v i uld be sei iousV affected by such a policy,
ye<, sir, it wight be destroyed tne eonsenuene s I
will neiti'r anticnatc nor mention.
Then, su, upoh ihe principles on which I con-
ceive this Government should legislate, we suoald
endeavor to regulate our tariff in such a way as
would impose impost duties, in addition to the re-
ceipts for the sale of the public lands, precisely lo
an amount that mi<"ht be demanded by the actual
wants oi tue Government We should hate a
tariff b^s-vl on j« t and equitable principles, equal
to the pdmimsiraüon of the Government, without
giving to it the least aspect of protection for one
branch of national industry, to the neglect and ex-
clusion oí the other, and yet so modeling it is to
do no juspce to that vaUaole class oí out citi/ens
who are now engaged in manufacturing pursm's
It would b¿ as unjust to the new Sta'es to bring
into market an ovci portion of the public lands as
it would be to the manufacturers to repeal the
whole sj etcm of duties on imports at the instant,
without advisal, and without aftoidmg t mely
notice of the impending act. Upon every pimci-
ple of just ce, the branches of national aeal'h
--hou'd receive equallj and alike a kind and gene-
roul suppoit. It has noto become no* only a mat-
ter >f policy, but of duty, ro' to d'sappo.nt the
expectations of f>e people when they have been
raised by the active and evident determination to
gratify their hopes
It will be seen, by the table, that we have already
havealaig  ponton of the pubhc domain wfveh
has been in the mnrket lor twenty years, and which
is so unproduc ive as not to induce the speculator
to enter it at the Government price. If this policy,
therefore, should be found not to produce a revenue
from the public lands, you would be compelled to
bring into market the new land, « hich is consider-
ed moie valuable for all the purposes of cultiva-
tion. The only piudent and judicious course to
pursue in relation to these poor lands would be, to
reduce the price of them, and to secure to those
■who have sedied them the preference over all

Mr Speaker, the two hHndredand fcity millions
of acres of pubhc lards now undei the control of
the Government beiong to the'vhole peopk, d'ey
are as much mine and my constituent as they are
your*. They have been taken possession of, a
small portion of them, for they belonged to us all,
as tenants in common , and, by thus enter ng on
them, your constituents and mine did but exercise
a common, ii net a legal right, which came into
exis'ence with your pre-emptive system of the
yews 1807, 1814, 1824, and 1830. In the last
named year a general bill was passed, giving to
actual settlers on all the public lands the privilege
of enteung one hundred and sixty acres at the Go-
vernment price, v hich is within a fraction at much
as your speculators give. For further information
on this subiect I beg leave to refer the House to

shall ask them if they are prepared to do unto
others as they would have others <o «Id  untó them?
Are you not willing to give the pioneer, who has
buffeted the slorm, strngg'ed arm to arm, and
breast to breast, in bio dy conflict with the savage
foe, who has opened your roads, and improved
your whole domain, a preference over tha grasping
speculator, who has rendered no service to your
country? Are yon prepared to say by yottr legis-
lation that the poor settler, who has made his little
improvement, erected his log cabin, amid ail ihe
hardships and dangers incident to die settlement of
a new country, shall be af the meicy of the mo-
neyed power1 that such a man shall not have one
farthing for his labor' Can you, will you, throw
his improvement into the market, to be purchased
by some remorseless speculator, at one dollar and
twenty-five cents the acre'
Sir, this House is not prepared for any such act
of cruelty and injustice It is not rtpe enough in
perfidy to aid in a scheme calculated to rob the pio-
neers of ihe West of Iheir legitimate rights As; well,
sn, might the Government, or the purchaser of* the
settlement of the pioneer, divest him of his horse
his sheep, and ms cattle, and sell them, and pat the
avails of them in the coffers of the Government, or
the pockets of the speculator, as to take away the
property he had acquired by his industry. Si1, I
am sure that my Government is not prepared for
the commission of any such acts* of outrage; nor
will I believe it capable of any such basene-s and
madi ess ¡ill I am compelled to acknowledge the
mortifying fact by thos° evidences which can only
be behevedwhen they fall within the range of our
personal observation.
I have already trespassed too long upon the kind
indulgence of the House, and will close with beg-
ging the friends of this bill to reject all amend-
ments that may finally endanger its passage. It is
noi the best we could desne, but it will afford relief
to thousands, and make glad the hearts of many of
^ our most worthy and industrious citizens, who
fpel tha' their ht.le oil depends upon the lioeratny
of this House, to save them from the iron grasp oí
the merciless speculator. I am now done, after re-
turning my acknowledgments to the House for their
patience and attention.

mencemem of the cash system, 6,806,243 acres
That amount may be properly considered a pro-
tection as far as it goes, and no more. I now call
on our Eastern friends to say whether they will be
satisfied with that protection for their manufactures;
and, if not, (and I am sure that they will not) I
INDEPENDENT TREASURY.
SPEECH OF~MR. RHETT,
Of South Carolina,
In the house of Representatives, June 25,   ISIS__On
the Independent Treasury bill.
Mr. Chairman ■ i"ne gentleman from Mississip-
pi, [Mi Pkentiss,] in the exordium of his speech,
delivered a few days since, thought proper ireclv
ti descanted on the course and portion of t'.a* por-
tion of the Stite Righfpartv, to which I profess
to belong. He taunted us with our "new allies,"
associated oa ihe great measure before the com-
ía ttee, with a corrup' ¿Ulmimstrat on," to which
we had been most bitterly opposed. The gentle-
man fr< m New ifork [Mr. Hoffman] ha- given an
mdit idual direction to these charge* hy speaking
of my  "new 7eal" as a convert—"the j-f- of the
honey-noon'"-----and many   of  iho-e   in'erem-;,'
flight ot Jancy n sratory, on which his r< pin Hum
foi statesmanship so jus'lv and entirely i*erp> cis
!n simple language, the charge is—a ch-ircd in
ou- politi-jil associations and conduct, ni-hon* sui-
fic enl reasons to justify it, and the charge will be
just or ground'ess, according to the strergih ot the
reasons They have been repeatedly as-iimei' le-
fore; but error can somet mes onl> be iefu ed by
eontirual refutation
Now. 'jf, so far as Í am personally cf ncerned
I might deny any change in mj political associa-
tions or conduct, and leave all accusers to make
out, if they can, the truth of their charges. I came
here allied to no p?rty—knowing nothing of the
course the new Administration was about to pur-
sue—deeply distrustful of its policy, but prepared
to support it in every measure it should propose to
the country consistent with those great political
and constitutienal principles which I have ever
maintained. In this spirit of distrust, I voted for
the  honorable gentleman from Tennessee [Mr.
