direction of Franklin; moving to the right of and parallel with the Columbia pike, with flankers well out, watching the enemy, who was maneuvering for our trains. This march was most arduous to the troops, who had already been twenty-four on constant duty without sleeping or eating. At 11 o'clock we arrived at Stevens' Hill, two miles south of Franklin, and formed line of battle, my right resting on the hill, where we remained until 1 p. m., when, by order of General Wagner, I moved my command to the west side of the Columbia pike, in front of Stone Hill (see accompanying sketch*), posted a strong line of skirmishers covering my front and flanks, and saw the balance of the army retire to a position in the rear. From the top of Stone Hill in the rear of my brigade I saw the enemy come through a gap in Stevens' Hill, in two columns, one formed on the right, the other on the left of the pike. At 2 o'clock I sent word to General Wagner that the enemy was advancing in force and was about to envelop my flanks. With my skirmish line and a section of artillery posted on Stone Hill I retarded the advancing column until I received orders, and withdrew my command to a position one-third of a mile in advance of the main line of works on the right of the Third Brigade. I here received orders to give battle to the enemy, and, if able, drive him off; of overpowered, to check him as long as possible, and then retire to the main line of works. At about 3 p. m. the enemy drove in my skirmishers; advanced in heavy columns, striking the Third Brigade, and pressing down on the Fortieth Indiana Veteran Volunteers on the left of my line. This regiment steadily held its position, driving back the enemy at every attempt to force our lines until the Third Brigade, on my left, fell back, when I gave the order to retire to the main line of works. We had much difficulty in getting into works, owing to a heavy line of abatis of locust boughs placed there for some purpose, through which my line had to pass. This caused some delay which enable the enemy to get within fifty feet of us; fortunately five of my regiments had held their fire, when, forming quickly behind the works, they poured into the advancing column a volley so deadly that the enemy fell back in dismay, only, however, to renew the attack, which now became a hand-to-hand fight over the parapet, lasting until 10 o'clock at night. Fresh troops were constantly hurled against our lines, until the enemy had made eleven distinct assaults upon our works with a determination only surpassed by the undaunted courage of our troops. Regiments would charge over the parapets into our lines only to be beaten down with clubbed muskets or taken prisoners. Private James S. O'Riley, Company I, Fortieth Indiana Volunteers, bayoneted the color-bearer of the Fifteenth Alabama Regiment, and carried away the flag. In front of the Ninety-seventh Ohio Volunteers a rebel regiment planted their colors on our works. First Sergt. Alfred Ransbottom. Company K, of that regiment, captured the flank and took the color-bearer prisoner. We captured from the enemy 284 prisoners, 45 of whom were officers.

My loss in this engagement, although fighting behind a good line of works, was 16 commissioned officers and 402 enlisted men.

I could here instance many acts of great personal courage, but where all did so well I deem it improper if not invidious to make distinctions.

My staff consisted of Captain Henry C. Tinney, assistant adjutant-general; Lieutenant Louis L. Cox. aide-de-camp; Captain John W. Aughe, acting assistant inspector-general; Captain Orpheus C. Harvey, provost-marshal, and Captain George A. Lemert, topographical engineer. These officers were of invaluable service to me, promptly carrying my orders and
