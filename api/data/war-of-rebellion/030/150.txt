Cincinnati, Ohio, December 9, 1862

Brigadier-General BOYLE, Louisville, Ky.:

Your order to Bruce to concentrate is right. Repeat it, so that he shall have no excuse for not obeying. Make him understand that there is no reason for fighting against odds so long as he can do as he pleases. If the enemy outnumbers him, he should fall back on Granger. The two ought to be able to whip the enemy. Send the four companies Fourth and Fifth Indiana to Munfordville or Lebanon for the present. Governor Morton has no artillery, I think, but will ask him.

H. G. WRIGHT,Major-General, Commanding.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I respectfully ask, if consistent with the public interest, that Major-General Hartsuff may be assigned to duty with this army corps.

Major-General.

NASHVILLE, TENN.

December 10, 1862-midnight.

Major-General HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

The news up to date, from all my scouts, goes to show that Hardee and Buckner are at Nolensville, a small town, 16 miles from here, and that a desperate effort is to be made by the rebel cavalry to strike our railroad line somewhere. Fort Donelson and Fort Henry are fully warned and prepared for a snap on them. General Thomas' scouts have not yet reported as to Kirby Smith being at Lebanon. I hope to have information to-night of this, and that the movements of the enemy may yet enable me to strike him a blow near us, which will virtually end the game.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.
