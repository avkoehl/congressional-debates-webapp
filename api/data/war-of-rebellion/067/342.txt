house, became briskly engaged, the brunt of the affair falling on Smyth's brigade. The enemy pressed Gibbon's advanced posts heavily, but gained no material advantage. To relieve him it was proposed to attack with Barlow's division on his right, and the arrangements were made accordingly, but the enemy's line was found on examination to be so strong and carefully protected by heavy works and abatis that the projected assault was abandoned and quiet was restored along the line by dark. There were no movements of any importance by the troops under my command on the 25th. On the evening of the 26th, in obedience to instructions, I withdrew my command to the heights on the north bank of the river, destroying the railroad and country bridges. The corps remained massed in this position until about 10 a. m. on the 17th, waiting for the troops preceding to clear the road, when we marched over the county and old stage roads to the vicinity of the Pamunkey, going into camp about 10 p. m. This day concluded the operations of my command during the third epoch of the campaign.

The march from Anderson's Mill, on the Ny River, to Milford, and thence to the North Anna, was made with great rapidity, and was very severe upon the officers and men of my command. Their conduct throughout was good, and was marked by distinguished bravery in the contests which occurred at the North Anna. I have seldom witnessed such gallantry and spirit as the brigades of Egan and Pierce displayed in the assault upon the enemy's works, which commanded the wooden bridge over the North Anna. Barlow's and Gibbon's divisions had a sharp affair with the enemy, who were in entrenchments on the south side of the river on the evening of the 24th of May, in which they lost quite heavily.
