HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVALRY DIVISION,ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

August 28, 1864 - 6.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-General ANDERSON:

GENERAL: Am at crossing of Smithfield and Brucetown road over the Opequon; Wickham's brigade guards this ford and Fry's Mill ford. McCausland is at Beason's, and Lomax was ordered to hold fords from Smithfield to Bunker Hill, and all approaches north of those points. Lomax's old brigade is between Summit Point and Locke's Ford, on Opequon, watching through Berryville to Shenandoah. Will try and find out to-night the nature of this advance.

Respectfully,

FITZ LEE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE CONFEDERATE STATES,Richmond, August 29, 1864.

Lieutenant General J. A. EARLY,

Commanding, &amp; c.:

On return of Major-General Ransom from your army his opinion was desired as to the future of his late cavalry command, and he was requested to suggest such changes as would improve the discipline and increase the efficiency thereof. I inclose you a copy of his report* before taking any action, and request your suggestions. As part of the command was for some time under Major-General Breckinridge, he may be better acquainted than yourself with the personnel. I therefore desire you to obtain an expression of his opinion also as to that part. It is feared that too radical a change may produce dissatisfaction in those commands raised mostly in the country now held by the enemy and causae many desertions. At the same time it is felt that some stringent measures are necessary to secure discipline and prevent disaster.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BRAXTON BRAGG,

General.
HEADQUARTERS LEE'S CAVALRY DIVISION,ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,

Near Brucetown, August 29, 1864 - 7.30 p. m.

General ANDERSON:

GENERAL: The enemy reoccupied Smithfield this afternoon; nothing but cavalry seen. I have ordered a regiment of cavalry to picket the ford at the crossing of Brucetown and Smithfield road over the Opequon, and a regiment also at Fry's or Smith's Mill, with a squadron in front, as close to Smithfield as it can be placed.

Respectfully,

FITZ LEE,

Major-General.
