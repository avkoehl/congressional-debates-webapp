HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY BRIGADE,Near Falls Church, Va., August 21, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel J. H. TAYLOR,

Chief of Staff and Assistant Adjutant-General:

COLONEL: In reply to the communication from the major-general commanding, requesting a more definite statement concerning the information sent to your headquarters, I have the honor to inform you that the strength of the enemy in Culpeper and Warrenton and their movements were ascertained from a citizen who left Culpeper on Tuesday last. He reports a whole division at Culpeper and 2,500 infantry, besides cavalry, at Warrenton; that relative to the use of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad and the force at Culpeper was obtained from Elkton, from several citizens who talked freely to our men, under the impression that they were rebels, as they were disguised; that that concerning Kincheloe was obtained from one of his own men captured. I regard all the above as reliable. The Thirteenth New York will leave to-morrow morning. They are unable to leave sooner owing to their horses not being shod. Please see communication inclosed.*

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

H. M. LAZELLE,

Colonel Sixteenth New York Cavalry, Comdg. Cavalry Brigade.
