HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS, July 21, 1864.

General WILLIAMS:

General Bartlett who has reported here has no assistant adjutant-general and has asked if Captain C. W. Emory (C. B. Amory], who was appointed for General Stevenson, can he assigned to him. General Bartlett takes General Stevenson's old brigade. General Stevenson has already been appointed to a command in Fifth Corps. General Bartlett thinks Captain Emory [Amory] is to arrive from Washington to-day. General White is to have the Fourth Division.

A. E. BURNSIDE,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 21, 1864-6.40 p. m.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

So far as we know Captain C. W. Emory, assistant adjutant-general, has not been assigned to duty with this army, but Captain C. B. Amory, assistant adjutant-general, was not long ago assigned to us. He was, however, subsequently transferred to the Third Brigade, First Division, Tenth Army Corps. Perhaps he is the officer you allude to. If not and should Captain Emory report to us he will assigned to you as requested.

S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

General S. WILLIAMS, Assistant Adjutant-General:

General Bartlett reported under General Orders, Numbers 70, War Department, 1863. He has but just reported and has not yet really joined his command.

A. E. BURNSIDE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, July 21, 1864-9.10 p. m.

General BURNSIDE:

General Orders, Numbers 70, of 1863, would seem to require that General Bartlett should report at these headquarters for assignment to duty. In your dispatch you state that General Stevenson has been appointed to a command in the Fifth Corps. Is there not some mistake about this?

S. WILLIAMS,Assistant Adjutant-General.
