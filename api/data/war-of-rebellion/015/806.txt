or eight pieces of artillery, and a small force of cavalry. They came from the direction of Union, crossed the Greenbrier River at the bridge, driving in our pickets. They formed a line of battle on the hill east of town, our camp being on the hill west of town, and shelled the town and our camp. I at once formed my line of battle and marched on them. My men encountered them on the outskirts of the east side of town. We drove them back, they disputing every inch of ground utterly demoralized, throwing away their blankets, hats, coats, accouterments, and some guns. Having only 1,200 or 1,300 men, I was afraid to follow them for fear they had another column to attack us in our rear, which was entirely unprotected, or else I might have followed them and prevented the burning the bridge. We lost some 10 killed, 40 wounded, and 8 missing. The enemy's loss is much greater; have no correct list yet. We captured four cannon, two rifled and two smooth, and some 200 stand of arms, and about 100 prisoners, among them one lieutenant-colonel, one major, and several captains and lieutenants.

I regret to have to report that our wounded men passing to the rear were fired on from the houses and some killed. I have instituted a search, and shall burn all the houses from which was firing from and shall order a commission on those who are charged with firing, and if found guilty will execute them at once in the main street of this town as examples. I will send detailed report by mail.

I am, sir, very respectfully,

GEORGE CROOK,

CAPTAIN: Nothing new to-day. Enemy retreated in direction of Union, greatly demoralized; stragglers are still coming in. The rebels left 38 dead on the field, and 66 wounded that we have found, besides carrying a good many of their wounded with them. Besides the four pieces of artillery we have collected some 300 stand of small-arms; have no doubt many are still lying in the brush. We took 100 prisoners. Our loss was 13 killed, 53 wounded, and 7 missing. I send prisoners and some of our wounded and small-arms to Gauley to-day. Various rumors say that Jackson is going to make a descent on us, but we are prepared for him. Greenbrier River is too much swollen to be crossed now. My transportation is so limited that I can scarcely supply myself here, let alone making any advance on the enemy.
