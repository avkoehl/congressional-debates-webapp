In a note to me Jordan asked that I would forward the letter by the first courier to General Bragg, and it was accordingly given to a courier to take to General Bragg. A day or so later Jordan was at Chattanooga, and told me the had forwarded to General Bragg a letter form you suggesting a plan of campaign, and I understood from him that the letter I have mentioned above was be able to tell you if the letter I have mentioned was the one spoken of in the Northern papers. If it was, I need not institute the search you desire.

We are looking with great interest to the coast of Carolina and Georgia. I have no doubt you will have hot work there before long. I trust yo will be able to resist all the attacks the Abolitionists can make on you.

Yours, very truly, &amp;c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

[Major General SAMUEL JONES:]

MY DEAR GENERAL: The letter you refer to sent by Jordan to Bragg contained the substance of what I wrote to Cooper, but was not captured and has not been published. It was several days after that I sent to Jordan the copies of another letter to Bragg and the one to Cooper, both of which were captured or stolen and published. I believe the latter was the case, for they never were to be sent farther than Chattanooga, but to Jordan where he was. We are making all our preparations to receive the Abolitionists with bloody hands and hospitable graves.

Yours, very truly,

G. T. B.

[Indorsement.]

I recollect distinctly that a letter sent as described by General Jones in his letter was received at General Bragg's headquarters. The letter was directed in General Jordan's handwriting, and had G. T. B. in his handwriting in one corner.

JNumbers M. OTEY,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
