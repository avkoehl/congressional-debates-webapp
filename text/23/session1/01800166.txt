THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Feb. 8,
claims of those sought to be embraced by the ori-
ginal resolution of the honoiable member from
Kentucky, [Mr Chilton,] appeal ¡>olely to our
sympathies and generosity, and do not possess
any of tnose strong and peculiar features which
justified Congress in passing the bill to compensate
'the surviving officers and soldiers of the Revolu-
tion. One was a debt, acknowledged to be due
for services rendered undei a contract made with
the Government under tne old Con federation, and
which every sense of national faith, justice, and
honor, requned us to Cancel, the other, a claim
where the services performed were for the piotee-
uon of the person and property of individuals who
have alieady received a full and adequate compen-
sation, yet who now demand ef Government a
permanent pension for having protected them.
Had the claims of the revolutionary soldier no
other baíis than that growing out of the perils,
the sufferings, and the puvations of those who
successfully fought the battles of our country, and
by a perseveiance and courage unparalleled in the
annals of history, steadily adheied to the ptinci-
ples of the Declaration of Independence—he had
no hesitation in saying that the present pension
system would never have been adopted No, sir,
had this been the principle it would have been
in vain at this time foi the friends of this proposi
Hon to have sought for a precedent which could,
by any analogy of reasoning, 01 any peiveision
of language, have jusüfit-d ti e adoption of this
resolution. The obligation of the Goveinmentto
remunerate the patnotic soluier, who had sealed
his devotion to the liberties of Jiis countiy with
his blood, and by yeais of the most toilsome and
dangerous service, was never denied It was
always conce led by the c instituted authorities of
the Government, whenevei the subject was dis-
cussed, that the old Congress had failed to comply
with the spuit find mor ility of the contract made
with our revolutionary soldiers, and that payment
was only delayed in consequence of the embar
rassments and poveity of oui country When,
therefore, peace retumed, and with it the agricul-
tuial and commercial inteiest of the United btites
had levived and infused new life and vigor into the
exhausted and wasted energies of tne countiy, she
set the bughtand glonousexinipleofdeclaiing to
the world that the national charactei was of as
much importance as independence, and 'hat wealth
and prospe lty weie but as dust in the bilance
compared with the dictates of humanity and jus-
tice
The hbno-able member from South Caiohna,
[Mi PihcKNiy,] to whose puuty of feeling and
correct puipose eveiy member of this House will
most cheeifully bear testimony, has been pleased
to say in icgaid to this act, mat it is not only
unconstitutional, but partial in us ben°fifs, oppres-
sive in llsoperition and tendency The indebt-
edness of the United States having always been
admitted, it is now too late to discus  the constitu-
tionality of the act The sixth article of the
Constitution expressly recognises the obligation of
the Government to pay "all debts conuacted, ami
' engagements entered into, before the adoption
* of the Constitution, and that they should be as
' valid against the United Sutes, m der the Con-
' stituiion, as under the Coi fedeiation " The
pimciples of this act have been sanctioned by oui
most enlightened statesmen, and thegi mtude of
millions has hallowed Us adop'ton It is most
unquestionably tri.e, sn, that far the greater poi
tion of that remnant of patriots, who weie en
gaged ¡n the service of then countiy in the re/o-
lutionaty stiuggle, and who are now receiving a
compensation under this act, reside in the north
ern States, but aie they, on this account, the less
entitled toa íemurie-aüon for services so mento-
uous as these are acknowledged to be by every
member on this fl >or, and to which even the
member from S >uth Caiolina has paid Oo hand-
some a tribute > Was not the war of the Revolu-
tion waged and corned on in defence of princmles

Surely not. The great body of the Amencan
people, by then lepiesentattves in Cjngiess, aie
to be governed by more extended and liberal
■news—by fai higner considerations They aie
to legislate for the whole nation, not a par', arid
provide for and consult the general interest and
welfaie The cause is obvious, and the answer
easy, why so great a numbei of the íevolutionaiy
pensioners are to be found in the noithern States
It was these States, sn, that furnished by fai the
greater proportion of troops foi the comest, and
the bones of our northern soldieis who fell in this
glorious stnigg'e for life and liberty now lie scat-
tered through the land, in eveiy poition of this
Union, wheieverdanger assailed, or the inteiest of
their country called them The surviving few,
whose claims have af length been recognized by a
grateful country, are now, in a g>-eat degree, de-
pendent upon the trifling pittance allotted to them,
and which serves to comfort their declining years
for the few days they may linger among us, befoie
they shall be called away to join their co-patnots
in aims who have already gone before them, and
lor whom the acknowledgment of their services
by then country came too late Let not, then,
the agitation of this question disturb the peace
and quiet of this lemnant of oui levolutioi ary
fathers now alive, noi let it embitter the evening
of their days with the appalling apprehension of
penuiy and want
But whilst he differed from honorable members
as to the policy and legality of the pension sys-
tem, he agieed with them,and with the honoiable
member fiom New llampshne, [Mr Hubbard,]
upon the propriety of i ejecting theelaims of tnose
embraced in thp íesolution—not but that the acts
perfoimed, and winch have been so feelingly and
eloquently portiayed, are highly meritorious and
worthy of piaise—not but tl at the individuals
aie entitled to all our sympathies and admuation,
but simply because, m then case, they can have
no possible claim upon the Government for ser-
vices rendered, however beneficial and useful,
beyond the express ard ímp^ed terms of their
contract
It may be said that it is the duty of every
Government to protect its own citizens in their
lawful puisuits and avocations This, as a gen
eral proposition, is undoubtedly Hue in time of
peace as well as war, yet who evei heard of an
instance, even in out late war, when our whole
western fiontierwas laid waste by the invading
enemy, oui villages laid m ashes, and oui cm
zens, without legaid to age,sex,or condition, shot
down, butclieied, and scalped oy their Indian al-
lies—where a pension has been given even to oi e
out of the thousands who daily, and without pay
oi remuneration, went forth as volunteers to meet
and repel the enemy ' The fai thest that oui Gov-
ernment have evei gone to sustain any principle
which can be assimilated to thns has been to co n-
pensate suffeiers for pioperty taken and destroyed
m wai under peculiar circumstances, but in no
instance had the principle been extended so far as
to remunerate ourofficeis and soldiera beyond the
teims of their contiacto. enlistment * To adopt
such a principle at this time would be subversive
of all the best interests and the true political econ
omy of this Government Tne evil would not
stop with establishing a system which, by its
terms, would embrace eveiy individual in the sei-
vice of the Government, either in the revolution
ary or íecent war, but, when once adopted as a
precedent, Us foice and effect wi 1 be felt to be for-
ever obhgatoiy upon the country, and we shall
nave a pensioned irmy fastened upon and living
upon the su! stance of the people, the conse
quence of which will be more dangerous, more
oppressive, and more to be dreaded than the
odious pension s\stem of Gieat Butain In mat
ters of such gieat and vital interest 'o this nation,
the utmost care and cau'ion should be used lest
by an indiscreet zeal fir doing some particuiai act
in which we havesufleied our feelings 10 become
tqp much enhs ed, we in1i<"t an Hiepaiable mjuiy
on our country Weaie placed heie as the^uai-
dinns of the pabhc tieasure, andas the tiu ites
of the American people, it is our solemn duty to
watch carefully, and delueiately examine every
pimciple submitted which has for its ohjeet ihe
disbursement of that treasure, or the establishment
of a precedent whicn is to be coextensive with the
Government
Mi L argued at length to show the dangerous
tendency of precedents, when a due regard to the
interests of the country was lost sight of, and refei-
red to seveial instances of the pernicious effect of
such incautious legislation, after which, he con-
tinued and said, it was not necessaiy for mm togo
into a particular examination of the daring exploits
and "hair-breadth escapes"of the sevetal individ-
uals who had immortalized themselves in border
warfare and personal contests with the savages,
the detail of which had excited such lively and
thrilling interest, nor into the motives which in-
duced tne brave pioneers of the West to leave their
cultivated farms, their homes, and firesides, and
penetiate into the lecesses of the forest, whether
influenced by the love of gain, the hunt and the
chase, or that peculiar eccentricity characteristic
of the old tiappei, so beautifully described by our
talented novelist, or that instinctive love of solitude,
and of the charms of the forest, which induced the
eelebiated Boon, so often alluded to n this debate,
to leave his habitation, and again plunge into the
.vildcrness many hundred miles beyond the abode
of civilized man, merely because, to use his own
language, " a yankeehad the audacity to come and
p'ant himself directly under his nose, within one
hundred and fifty miles of his cabin " All this it
was not necessary for him to inquire into Suffice
it to say, that no precedent exists which will
justify such an appropnation, nor can human
ingenuity bring these cases within the principles
established by the revolutionaiy pension bill, and
no cause can be shown whv a pension .should be
granted to those persons when thousands even
of our revolutionary veteians are excluded from
enjov. ing the liberal intentions of Congress, by the
rigid cons'iuction of the pension laws Mi L
heieargued to show that the same principle which
would give pensions to those persons engaged m
the conflicts with the Indians, would necessarily
lead to the extension of the pension system to
e>fery person engaged in military service; and he
contended that the soldier who fought atCtueens-
town, Chippewa, Lundy'a Lane, and New Or-
leans, was more deserving, and better entitled to
a pension, than they could possibly be, and he
concluded by asserting it was the principle of the
íesolution, and the inevitable consequences that
would flow fiomitjthat he condemned, and which,
if once sanctioned, would bring rum and beggary
upon the country These principles once adopted
as a precedent, there would not be an instance of
meritorious conduct, or of a conscientious dis-
charge of duty, in any department of the Govern-
ment, or even in private life, in which an indi-
vidual may not, with the same propriety, demand
a pension. He hoped, therefore, that the time of
tne House would not be longer occupied, with the
discussion of the resolution, for every incident
wmch could give strength to the claims had been
fanly presented, and Us advoca'es had furnished
every detail necessary for the House to form a
deliberate opinion upon its meiits He mustdep-
lecate the idea of its being sent to a committee to
be examined and reported upon, as this, in all
piobability, would only lead to a further pro-
tracted deba'e, and which was wholly unneces-
sary Every member now lully understood the
principles upon which the íesolution was based,
and was prepared to act upon it. He desned to
have the question taken, and the resolution and
the amendment both rejected.
Mi BOULDiN rose to íeply, but the hour
allotted foi morning business having expired,
The House proceeded to the consideration of
pnvate bills
The ¡«.solution offered yesterday, for printing
one thousand copies of the Navy Regulations,
was sdopttd
Tne House resumed the consideration of the
bill for the relief of Arnold Henry Dohrman,
which, after a long discussion, was ordered to a
third íesdipg
Tl>  bill for the relief of John Moret was taken
up, and, after some discussion, recommitted.
On motion of Mr MARSHALL, of Kentucky,
The Hojse took up, in the Committee of the
Whole, the bdl to provide for the settlement of
certt m commutatioii and other revolutionary
claims
