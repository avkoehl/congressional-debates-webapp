APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE

25th Cong....1st Sess.
Making public officers d'positories—Mr. Legare.
H. of Reps.
this view of the subject They seem to have felt
themselves bound to render our system of taxation,
which, even in its mildest form is, in fact, a confis-
cation of private propprty for public uses, as little
burthensome as possib'e to the community Sir,
what ever we may think of the policy pursuing
their footsteps any furthel, no one can deny that
they are entitled lo the gratitude of the country
for the past, and I, for one, am too sensible of
the benefit, to thiow it away without i ery mature
consideration, unless under the pressuie of a cogent
necessity
But we have been told, sir, that far from being an
innovation, this mode oí collecting the public rev-
enues was universal from the earliest times until the
beginning of the l?st century—thai is to °ay, unul
an age oi philosophic light and diffusive civiliza-
t on, at which another good old plan, established
from time immemorial, the burning of witches and
heritics, unhappily ceased too This coincidence
certainly appears to me to be entitled to some con-
sideration , the committee will see, that m the mat-
ter of innovation, going back too far is at least as
dmgerous as going forward too rapidly But there
has been another reference to the examples of the
past which struck me still more forcibly as a most
extraordiuary perversion of the lessons of experi-
ence Sir, I do confess to y ou, that before any
discussion had taken place in either part of this
Capitol, on the subject before you—long before I
had heard ot that allusion to the (¿ucestor, referred
to the other day by my eloquent friend trom New
York, (Mr Hoffman)—at the baie stating of this
project in its first conception and most general out-
lines, certain images piesented ihemselves to my
mind, and have evtr since haunted it in spite of all
I could do to banish, then Thev were ideas that in
my «imple way of considering such matters, shock-
ed and alarmed n e—ideas of Roman conquest
and Astatic despotism I thought of that most
fearful of all things, a vast empire, with power
centialtzed at its capital, with commerce centializ-
wg by the inevitable course of trade, which always
and every where tends to centralization, at some
great emporium, with its revenues collected only m
gold and silver, to be hoarded, as was the way at
Rome, and Babylon or Persepolis I fancied I
could see one of the Pioconsuls or Praetors—the
Bashaws of the Republic, as Montesquieu so justly
calls them—Verres, for example—going fouh with
thatsame dabster, surrounded with an army ot
publicans oi farmeit  of the revenue, to gather the
dues of Rome m some devoted province—another
Sicily—as dues were wont to be gathered by die
satraps o! that military commonwealth, that is to
t,ay, wrung with their blood from subjugated na-
tions, whose pleasant places were laid waste, witn-
out remorse toglui the rapacity of conquest Sir,
I hltle imagined that Mach a system would have
been cited, nay, a luded to, 11 this age, except with
a view to nispue the horror and execration it is so
well calculated to excite Roman example ' "The
Demon city," (as it has been w ell called by a w n
tei of genius Herder,) whose whole history, from
beginning to end is a tiageely far deeper and more
dreadful than the tale of CElipus or the Atndae,
and leadmsr to a catastrophe of an awful political
justice Why, sir, there is nothing m the annals
of Mongolian conquest, woise than the ravages
perpetrated by her consuls—by Mummius, Panlus,
/Emihus, Sylla—in some of the fairest and most
civilized portions of the earth There were
flourishing countries, vv hose fertility and population
were exhausted by a perpetual dram of corn and
gladiators to feed her lazy and licentious populace,
and amu'e them with the ulterable atiocitiesoi her
amphitheatre. And what was, the end of all this
misrule1 "Weakness, poveity, desolation, baibai
ism—the Goth, the \pndai, the Hun \et long
before the footstep of a b uñarían had been impiess
ed upon the soil of the einp k, as Gibbon Irs well
remarked, long before that scot'ige of God un'cr
whose horses' hooi the giass w?s said never io
grow again, had been sent io avenge the wrongs ot
mankind, m the course of half a century after
Coastantme had founded a new R< me, vhok 'racts
of fertile country had been compie'ely depepuhued
and abandoned Even of that paiadise ot all this
earth, on which poetry and panegyric have been
exhausted in every age, in all languages, the Cam-
pania fehx, a very considerable portion was become
a waste Nor, sir, ivas this owing to the depousm
of the Cesars, as an excellent writer has well ob
served, (Jacobs,) m reference to this passage of the
" Decline and Fall," and as this committee «ill do
well to remark There co-operated with that mis-
government, a curse which has been said, and is
thus proved, to oe worse than " the inclemency of
the reasons and the barrenness of the earth," (-Id
Smith,) a decreasing cunency The supply of the
precious metals had been for upwards of two cen-
turies continually diminishing, while the quantity
of them sent in quest of 1 jxunes to the East, to re-
turn no more, had been increasing in the same pro-
portion, and a rev enue of ^15,000,000 or 20,000,000
w as constantly levied in geld ard silver, to be expend-
ed at a distant capital, or on the frontiers This
important fact speaks volumes to us on this subject
It is unquestionably true that one of the greatest
cdiamines of the declining empire, was a circula-
tion diminishing so frightfully that the pay of a
general in tne third century w as no finally not
higher tl an that of p private had been in the reign
of Augustus, (Herder ) So much for the Rom in
sob-trusijRy S1STÍ.M, and the example of the
ducesloi '
But, sir, another objection to the present sjstem
is that it lend  to fluctuations in the currency, and
that brings me to consider the general effects of
the credh system upon the prosperity of the
country
I begin by admitting that there is something in
this objection, but by no means as much as is
thought by persons who have not veiy attentively
consideicd the subject Undoubtedly ii your le
venue instead of being umfoim, or it lea=t vaiy
m% veij little fiomjear to vear, be ntimitled to
fluctuate extremely—t i great sm plus 1 ke hat of
which you disposed last vear is to be allowed ever
and anon to accumulate, and then to be withdrawn
from one depository and scattered among may
others, to be again suddenly withdrawn from them,
and ultimately distributed without reference to the
wants of commerce and the course of business,
but on merely arbitrary principles, among 'he States
—if such financialb'undeisare tobe íepeattd often
in our futme policy, we should do well to confine
the effects of them within as narrow limits as pos-
sible, ind even a svstem of hoarding "mght, in such
a c^se, perhaps, do less rnrm than all tl is vexatious
uregulariti, ind uncertainty But in the Í is pi ice,
vv hose fault was that? Whose legis ation ocnsion-
ed that pieposterous accumulation' Who«e un-
equal and oppressive tariffs extorted from commerce
the vast sums which wereaterwards to be lavished
upon it with such intoxicating effects? Yours, sir,
—this house, this Congress >s responsible for what-
ever mischiefs grew out oí that flange anemaly

gentlemen, whether it has evei occi rred to them

would always be the effect—of such an accumula-

n n of (he committee to a view   "f it   that is
entitled to their profound consideration If I
do n< t greatly err, in all the conclusions to
which I hav e been brought by my íesearcbes m this
matteijj no calculation can be made of the effect
which the adoption—I will not say of the "hard
money system," but of any system whatever, call-
ing for a much greater demand 5f the precious
metils-—might have upon the state of trade
Sir, I have said that the importance of (hese
fluctuations m the paper currency of a country,
have been very much overrated Some people
¡>eem to thmk an expansion m the circulating me-
dium must always be attended with a sudden rise
in puces and a spirit of extravagant speculation
But it is not so Mr Tooke has shown that these
tw o th ngs hat e in fact very seldom coincided—that
speculation depends m the first instance, upon mo-
ral causes wholly unconnected with the state of the
currency , and, although an abundance of mouey
way, and does aggravate the evn where it exists,
jet, by itse'f, it never leads to any excitement
Take any example of a comma cial crisis you
please, and you will find that there were extraordi-
nary circumstances which acted on (he imagina-
tions oí men—florid pictures of general prosperity,
bright visions of possible success in new channels
of trade, and adv en'ures as yet untried There is a
remarkable pioof 01 this in the terrible convulsion
m England in 182o, the most serious peihaps that
she has ever passed through In 1822 there was
a most depiessed state of prices below the cost of
production The lowering of the interest on an im-
mense amount of Government stock m 1823 and
'2a, engendered an impatient desire of more
profitable investments Then came the acknowl-
edgment ot the independence of the South Ameri-
can States, unh hopos oí advantageous loans
to the new Governments, of great mining
speculations, and oi a vast extension of all
branches, of trade, upon which that great po-
litical event, it was supposed, could not fai' to pro-
duce sudden and incalculable efteefs The spirit
of adventure thus awakened, soon spread llself
abroad over every department of commerce and,
a moiil epidem c, as it has been well termed, bioke
out, such as no policy 01 Government, of free Gov-
ernment at least, could possibly control But the
same excitement would have occurred had the
circulation of England been metallic, and, sir, a
proof of it is to be found m the fact that owing to
a long sciesof good harvests, ind to the prepara-
tions vv men Ihf Bank of England had been making
to substitute gold foi the smctil notes which still cir-
culat J in 1824, hei treasure was unusually large,
(something like£13,000,000,instead of ¿10,000,000,
Us regular maximum,) and so far as her issues had
any thing to no with exciting the spirit of circula-
tion, it was not a deficiency, but an excess of bull-
ion ¡that occas oned the mischief—just as was the
case in this country during the last two years I
say, s 1, this spirit ol speculation is incident to the
•u venturous operations of commerce, and it makes
no diffeience «1 ether those operitims be carried
on in specie or m paper Ihe gentleman from
Pennsylvania who sits near me, (Mr Sergeant,) an-
ticipated me m c ting the exaltóle of the famous
bubble yeai in England, (1721,) when,as he justly
reman ed, the e. iculat en of that country might be
consiuered as almost exclusively metallic, foi the
issues of the bank «ere wnal ihey had been for
some veais before only about ¿£2,000,000, and not
more than half vv hat they w ere m a few y ears after,
in a state ol perfect calm But I will add another
instance, a most memorable and instructive one,
froi 1 our ownhistoiy If this country has ever
been blessed with a purely mcta'lic currency, itwss
