APPENDIS TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

PvbBc Lands—Mr. Rayner.

'roiii Dues he deuve v Horn * ly othei clause of the to^sti
ti i rt 1 so, where is ifí Webstei,m his diet tu iy, drf es
s >.o dispose" da meaning "to applj to a paiucu^i pi po e

will to pothei,topu into mo her'b hand or pos^e sin Ihe
g iti nan's constiuctio i moat then be entirely arbiuaiy— as
sumednieieiy to araw  • di e&pecial puipoae lie says this
nrooer y belongs to the Gwernnent, and not to the Itdeial
Union fhe. gtmleman is coriect &ofar as i elites to the lands
acquned by puiciuse They do belong to the Goveinmett
i fee of al' i icumbrance, and i he Go vernment being authorized
by the Gon utu unto dispose of them has the undoubted right,
according to the definition of Webster, to 'give, beetow, oi
part with' them to the S ates
The gentleman (rom Mame took the pound that this bill was
unconstitutional, because said he; H does not propose a dibtri
buitoiof the public lands, but adistribuhon of revenue The
right "to dispose oí" must mean the right to dispone of by sale,
asm any other manner, and if, as he admits, the lands belong
to the General Government in the first instance, the money
arising therefrom must certainly belong to it and the Govern
irient,as well a* a private individual, must have power todis
pose of that which belongs to it as well by distribution as in
the payment of deb's Bu , ays the honorable gentleman, thfie
isilp lepeahag clause m th s bill, to prevent the monoy arising
from these lands being ejected and paid into the Treasury m
the usual way, and hat this money, when placed m the Ttta
snry, loses its peculiar i ¡entity, and must partake of the same
mature of that raised from 4 taxes, imposts and excises," which
-^flaUonly becollec ed foi the purpose of ', lying the debts of
l-he United States " This is a piece ol refi icment woithya
"Virginia roluictan and no'at all suited to the piactical utili
lañan regí >n o! Maine If I deposite asum of money with an
individual for safe keeping he is absolved horn his obligation
wfcten he repays me the amount in a iy cunency which is a le
«ral tender III consign my crop to a (actor, with directions
to apply the proceeds to th payment ol a debt, and to pay
«v*r the balance, tf any, tome, he complies with his engage-
Tttsut by transmitting to me the a «ount #ot m the identical
iu(uls obtained, but in any othei money leceivable by law
It Is the identity ot amounr, not of money specially ícceived,
tliat imparts to the íund íeceivelfiom landMts peculiar chi
racier Money arqutres its imp itance, not from its intrinsic
value, but fiom the purposes it will accomplish The pn
«i >ns gran ed toyoui Revolutionary sol bus and the bounties
paid to your fishermen are gratuitous—it is ridiculous to talk
of their beins debts, for a debt is that which you aretmdei
obligation to pay Will the gentleman from Maine pretend
that no part of your revenue can be applied to these purpo
«es, after it has been put m the Treasurv and has therefore
partaken of the character of that raised irom taxts ind im
ports, whick he says can only be raised for the puipose of
paying debts'!
Th6 gentleman took the ground—or most of his paity did
who spoke on the subject—that the $25000 which we voted to
Mrs Uairison, wasagratuitv Still, I presume at, the law has
been passed, he thinks it naht she should be paid that am >unt
of money Will he insist that none o( the money m the Irea
scny can be constitutionally applied to that pin pose because it
has been raised from "taxes, imposta, and excises " which can
only be laid %r the purpose of paying the debts of the United
States? And according to hia position, that arising from the
sale of the public lands cannot be so applied, for as soon as it is
pvilnto the Treasury it loses its identity, and partakes of the
character or that arising fiom the forementioned sources The
fallacy of such an argument must be apparent toevery one
But, if he will he so strictly technical m his construction of
the Constitution, 1 ask him where he finds the powei to appro
pnate the proceeds of the public Wnds to the payment of the
debts of the United State?? Ihe power to 'dispose ofthetei
ntory" of Are Government t  a general one, qualified only by
<he claims of pauiculir Suites, and the genial limi s ol t¡ t

unlerthe same system of disposal which has been applied

sweep on, and mi  t sweep on, till the Rocky mounta nsan,
scaled and civiiiz Uion has p anted bei standard on the sho es
of tne Pac fie l*ut I do n sist that, as the t Id States, by then
bourty and the contribution of their (readme hive provided
the very means 01 then own decay, now, m this day of their
decline, yon should not forget tneu former ^aenfice^ hut mat
you should bestow upon them a j ortiun of the means which
they have put at your disposal foi the purpo&e of partially ie
stonng their prosperity
Tne position has been frequently taken in this, debate, and it
waspressed hy the gentleman from Georgia [Mi ALPOEo]that
this distr button is a gratuity, and that we have no ugh to give
away these lands, 01 tneir proceeds, to the ¡state Governments
It is too late to raise thigaigument, even if it were well founded.
Has not this Government uniformly given to the new State , on
their admission into the Union, every sixteenth sectien of all
the land within then limits for the purposes ol educatWi Has
it not ¿ranted to them tens of thousai ds of acies as sites for
public buildings for charitab'e institutions, etc 1 An 1 if this
Government has the right to give away a poiuon of t ie public
Ian s to the new States, has it not a right to give them the
whole? And if r has the light to ^ive the whole to he 1 ew
States, hab it rot a right to divide them equally by gilt among
all the States? The gentleman fiom Georgia is ©stopped from
iisingthis argument, by the uniform practice of the Govern
ment, ever since the land system f 1st went into operation
Again ihe party which is ¡so much oppj 1 to this measure
have mostly been m favor of a sradu-uionof \ 1 ces by which
the price of the Imd i& to be ^laduiPy It scned afu t it has
been so long in market, and th t the lanlsit-ss ijliao e aie

Goveinme t 1 as a right to &cll the^e lands, fot lets tl an, their
value, it htts the nght lo hi na down the pnce tf all to a mere
nominal sum, aod if it has i n«ht tosive away tf elan Is, after
they have been so long m maikt;t, it mi t h^ve ne 1 ght to
give the whole of them away m the fiist nstance ^) we tee
that the power of th s Government to give away fhe r oreeás
of the public lands is reeo-msed not on y Ly t e u 1 lorm piac
tice of the Governmer f, but by the un or 11 corns of the veiy
party who now oppose thi  measm e so s renuou^ly As to the
power of Con^tess todispore of tht^e hnds a id tod  so not
for the purpose of revenue, I wi 1 give an authority n n one
whose word has long been as potent with the pre pi Opposi
tmn party, as is the language of the Koian with the foiloweis
of Maho net In his annual message of Decembei, 1S32, Pre-
sident Jackson ¡says
"As the lands may nc w he con^ideied as lelevedtron this
pledge, the objcctfoi which tley wt-ie t d^d l«*i ¡eenac

and general intei est of the American people, ' &c it seetns
to me to be oui tn e j obey that the public lands ¡shall cease as
soon as practicable to be asouice of rever ue '  ice
This authority I commend especially to the conc,üLidUm of
the gei tleman from Mame, ftVIr ti-iFFOan ]
It appears from the repoitof the be retaiy of tlu. Treisury
of July iO 1841, that donations of land, to the amou t oi n il
honsof acrep, have been made to the new States, foi the piu
poses of their domestic improvement5' * Now, sir, I do not
find fault with this lam not one of those who 1 ok with
jealousy upon the rising gloiyand power of the West Far
from it Ihe West is 1 j art of my country Here uzens aia
