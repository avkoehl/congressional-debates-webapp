Wisconsin Contested Election—Mr. Biddle.
Ho. or Reps.
does this claim rest' I dislike this keeping at a
distance fiom the subject, this firing at long shots,
tin  dealing m general* It was the saying of a
veiy eminent jurist that "fiaud links in, general-
ities " When our public treasuie is to be dealt
out, I desire to see some definite, some obvious rea-
son asbigned for it.
But, it I understood the Speaker at the com-
mencement of this debate, he thought that the
" House had recognized Mr Jones as the sitting
member " If this be fact, we ought not now
to refuse compensation to him We should be
estopped now fiom denying that which we admitted
at the commencement oí tne session In other
words, we are bound by the same pnnciples by
which Mr. Jones is bound—the principle alluded
to some time since, in which I stated that Mr.
Jones, having abserted himself to be the Delegate
¡n ISSb, should not, in 1838, say he was not a
Delegate in 1836 I would apply the same rule
to ourselves It it> not merely a rule of law, but
it is a rule of eonsisUncy, of common justice, and
common sense If we have expressly recognized
Mr Jones as the Delegate, by such recognition
we must have induced him to remain here and
spend his time, and we ought not now to turn
round and say he is not entitled to compensation
for his time If this House have, in fact, led Mr
Jones into error, the loss ought not to fall on him
if the nation induced him to come here and spend
his time, nothing can be more plain than that dic-
tate of justice which says the nation shall pay
¡urn But how stands the case' Mr Jones's
time had fully expned The office win vacant
Mr Doty was heie, had selected his seat, and at
the proper time piesented his credentials for the
purpose of taking tne oath as the Delegate fiom
Wisconsin To this Mi Jones objected, deny
mg the right of Mr Doty On th s, objection the
administration of the oatn was delayed 1 he ob-
jection was the act ot Mr Jones, by it he gained
nothing The delay in receiving Mi Doty was
the act of the House, in couttesy to Mr Jones's
■objection But it is difficult for me to ree how
we recognized Mr Jones by delaying the reception
of Mr Doty I think no one will say that thus
far we had recognized Mr Jones By what act,
then, did he become the sitting member? Was
jt by sitting in the hall instead of thegalleiy?
He had been a member here, and by the rules of
the House had the privilege of the Hall Then
iie gained nothing by his seat But I appiehend
that no gentleman will claim any i^cojrn tion by
this House except by the vote of the House A
legislative body can only speal, em only act by
then vote The i lie is to i plain to hemisunder
stood It requires a majority of the House to do
any act That ma]Oiity is ascertained by vote
Hence arises the rule that "a legislative body
•can only act or speak by vote " Having laid
down the rules by which we could have recog-
nized Mr Jones as the Delegate, we will proceed
to inquire whether wt have, by vote of the House,
thus íecogmzed him as the Delegate The first
voteof the House was to refer Mr Doty's right
to a seit here to the Committee of Elections
This, I think, will not be urged ns a recognition
of Mr Jones The next vote of the House de-
clared that Mr Doty had the light to a seat as
Delegate, and that Mr Jones had no such right
This, then, is the only recognition of Mi Jones
by the House It is an express denial 1 he only
vote on the subject given by the House, in words
a  plain as language peimits, denies his light
here, and yet it is urged that we have recognized
him as the sitting Delegate I ask gentlemen to
point us to the vote, to the act of this House, by
which we recognized him as a Delegate Let
them no longer keep at a distance, but let them
refer the House to the specific, the paiticular recog
mtion. Let them give time, place, and circum
stances And now, Mr Speaker, I will only add
that having assigned the views which will govern
me in my vote, I rest the subject with the House
in doing this, I have spoken fteely and unre-
servedly Of Mr Jone-, as a man and a gentle-
man, ! know nothing except what appears from
the case bet >re us Fiom that I speak, and on
•hat I must act Í know that it is a delicate sub-
ject to coraoat the granting of money to one who
baa mingled with members m this Hall—one who
iNo. 5
has long associated with them as a fellow mem
bei But, sir, I was not sent here to indulge in
delicacy of feeling, wherp the public treasure is
concerned My generosity may be displayed in
my pi a ate concerns, butnot with the public funds
1 have no right to gne away that which belongs
to the nation It is a fact, so far as my expe
nence has extended, that claims urged upon this
House meet with little favor, unless based upon
principles of obvious justice and policy Such I
know to be the case so far as they come through
the committee over which the gentleman from
Kentucky [Mr Chambers] piesides with so
much zeal and devotion to the national interests
Sir, the widow and the orphan, rendered destitute
and penniless by Indian baibanties, are denied,
sternly denied, indemnity foi their loss of houses,
furniture, and property, sustained by conflagra-
tions kindled with savage hands, and shall we
bestow the money withheld fiom them on claims
like the one undei consideration ? Shall we, sir,
guard and defend the public treasure with one
hand, while with the other we scatter it to the four
winds of heaven >
Mr CALHOUN considered that Mr. Jones
had been elected for the whole Congress, and not
for a fraction only He considered him entitled
to the money, as he had come on with a strong
case Mr Jones had now been here six weeks,
awaiting the decision of the House, and if he was
not entitled to any remuneration for such time,
why had not the House taken the matter up and
decided it at once
Mi POPE advocated the claim, on the ground
that there weie good and substantial reasons for
disputing the spat Had Mr Doty been the un-
successful competitor, he would ha^e voted for
the payment of his expe ises on the same ground
He h i, ed the resoluti m would not be adopted
Mi DIDDLL said that he had been depuved,
by accident, of the opportunity of voting on the
original question, and he felt, therefore, the more
earnest in íesistnij, the present motion The prac-
tice of the House wa^ admitted to be, in the ex
eicise of a sound discretion, to make theallowance
when satisfied that the contest had not been idly
raised, but that the question presented was one fit
to invoke its grave and deliberate judgment
The practice was a salutary one The House
had never stultified itself by holding that it was
incompetent to discriminate, and to guard against
abuses It was calculated to plice all candidates
and all classes of voters on a footing If a candi-
date, in case of contest, could not come on to urge
his claim (and we all know that, in prac ice, his
p esenee ib indispensable) without dangei ofpe
cuniury sacrifice in the event of a failuie only the
man of ample means will \entuie on the expen-
ment In the pooler agricultural districts, voters
will not be inclined, or able, to raise a purbc by
individual contribution to send on their cnampior,
and the result would be an incalculable advantage
to the man of affluence, or to him who had wealthy
backers.
The position in which Mi Jones stood claimed
for his case the most candid consideration He
had received the money fiom the Speaker it was
beyond recall, but on an intimation from a single
member that a question would be taised, he in
stanily places it at our disposal, with an exprés
sion of his cheerful acquiescence in whatevei decís
ion we may make Mr B wouid not say of our
depaiting associate, " nothing in life became him
like the leaving of it," but he would say that his
courbe confoimed to the fiank, ingenuous, and
honorable spirit by which thatgen'leman had ever
been charac euzed Mr B said it was not his
intention to go at large into the argument as to
Mr Jones's right to the seat Yet an outline
wauld not be misplaced
The earliest act which had a distinct bearing on
the question was that of Maich 3, 1817, entitled
"An act further to regulate the Territories of the
United States, and their electing Delegates to Con-
gress "
This act is not of a temporary, occasional char-
acter, it is a well matured and fa- «ighted supple
ment to the great ordinance of 1787, calculated to
meet a new aspect m the afFaiis of the Territories
It piovides as follows
"In eve)y Teintory of the United States in
J ' which a temporary government has been, 0)
I ' /  i eaftcr shall oe established, and which, by virtue
' of the ordinance of 1787, or of any subsequent act
' of Cimgi ess passed m to be passed, now hath, or
1 ' heieaftei shall have the right to send a Delegate to
' Congress, such Delegate shall be elected every
' second year, for the same term of two years for
' which members of the House of Representatives
' of the United States are entitled "
No one can well doubt the object or the wisdom
of this provision     It draws the political action of
the Terntoiy, as prompdy as possible, into exact
coincidence with  that of the States, so that the
people  shall  become familiarized to the usages
which aie finally to prevail, that its habits shall
become fixed in harmony with those of the Union
It must be apparent to every one how widely
I the decision which has been made by the House,
in reference to Wisconsin, violates this policy.
The Delegate is to sen e a moiety of his term in
t the present Congress, and a moiety in the next
I     Instead of duly attaching the Territory to the
tram of cars which has preceded hei, she is placed
, with one wheel m the middle of the track and the
I other outside of it, and, in the end, we shall be
! obliged to lift her, by mam bodily force, from this
false and awkward position, in order to place her
upon the track into which she ought to have been
wheeled at the outset    See another strange result:
The validity of each election has to be passed upon
by two distinct and independent bodies     We de-
cide as to thatpoition which falls withm our polit-
ical existence, and the remainder is in abeyance
until our successois shall assemble a year hence'
The necessity for this course, on our part, is
thus made out by those who insist on it An act
of Congress of the third of February, 1819, in re-
lation to the Teiritmy ef Michigan, provides that
" the citizens of Michigan Territory be, and they
'are heieby, authonzed to elect one Delegate to
' the Congress of the United States," and the per-
son thus elected " shall be furnished, by the Gov-
' ernor of said Territory, with a certificate, under
'his official seal, setting forth that he is duly
' elected, by the qualified electois, the Delegate
' from said Territory to the Congress of the United
'States, foi the term of two years fiom the date of
' said certificate "
Doubtless this is explicit, and overrules the act
of 1817 Not only does it violate the policy of
that act, but it contains, moreover, a most anoma-
lous and alarming provision The Governor of
a Territory is the creature of the President of the
United States Yet his will shall determine the
term of office of a Representative m the popular
branch of Congress' Mo time is provided within
which he shall give the cer'ificate He may post-
pore it if he desire that a political favorite shall
reach an anticinated crisis in the afairs of the
countiy, or he may antedate it or give to it the
earliest possible date, in order that a political ad-
veisaiy may be ctu short of reaching the samo
crisis
The ques'ion is whether these extraordinary
piovibions have passed into the act of 1836, " es-
tablishing the territorial goiemment of Wiscon-
sin " That act bears date 20th April, 1836, and
provides that " a Delegate to the House of Repre
sentitives of the IJ nited Sutes, to seiveforthe teim
oftno yeais, may be elected " It provides further,
thaf'the peison havmgthegreatestnumberofvote';
shall be declared by theGovernoi to be duly elected,
and a ceitifieatei/iereo/shall be given to the peison
o elected "
Thus it wnl be seen that whilst the provision',
of the two acts are, to a certain degiee, coincident,
the act of 1336 omits the very words which, in re-
lation to the act of 1819, compels us reluctantly to
give a construction at vanance w th obvious poll
cy, and rendering the term of office of a member
ot this House contingent on the accidental date of
the Governor's certificate How, then, are we to
render definite what is thus left open in the act of
1836* Shall we, wuh a sort of mother's fondness)
for the most deformed and peiverse of cur off-
spring, lemsta e the obnoxious words thus dis-
carded, with all their attendant mischief and m-
con^en -nee } Snail we do this, or shall we rather
nres icie that Congress, in the striking difference,
ot phraseo'ogy, and in apparently abandoning the
commencement of the teim of service, ao expressly
