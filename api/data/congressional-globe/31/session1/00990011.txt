Mr. HARALSON rose and said, that as this

probability that a Speaker could be elected to-
day, he would move that the House adjourn
until Monday, at twelve o'clock, m. [Cries of
"Agreed"—"No"—"Another vote."] Tellers
on the motion were asked and refused.
And the question was then taken and decided in
the negative.
So the House refused to adjourn.

No choice.
Mr. BUTLER, of Pennsylvania, submitted the
following proposition:
Resolved. That Robert C. Winthrop, of Massachusetts,
be chosen Speaker, and the Clerk of the House for
the thirty-first Congress.
Mr. BUTLER said he offered the proposition,
to be disposed of as the House saw fit. Gent emen
on the other side migh fill the blank if they
chose; and if the proposition met the views of
those gentlemen, it would doubtless be readily
adopted.
Mr. THOMPSON, of Mississippi, suggested,
as the gentleman from Pennsylvania proposed a
bargain "to meet the views of gentlemen on his
(the Democratic) side of the House, that he should
insert the name of Howell Cobb for Speaker, and
the other side could fill the blank for Clerk, as they
saw fit.
Mr. BUTLER replied that he was willing to
refer the question to the decision of the House.
With reference to the gentleman's remark desig-
nating this a bargain, he (Mr. B ) would say it
was not a private bargain. It was a p-oposition
offered without consultation with anybody, made
in open House. The only object which he had
in view was to secure an organization, which was
important to enable them to receive the President's
message and the other documents, and lay them j
before the country. Another advantage would be,
that the Government would be relieved of the bur- ]
den of expenses to which it was now subjected, i
under an arrangement which, he understood from ,
the Postmaster General, had been made, by which i
the Government had had the expresses under pay j
during the week past, for the transmission of the I
message and docume- ts at any moment. i
Mr. ROOT inquired of Mr. Buti.er, with refer-
ence to these expresses, whether he understood
that any other than the northward and eastward
express had been chartered? whether any provis-
ion had been made for the transmission southward
and westward?
Mr. BUTLER replied that he was not informed
upon this point. He had merely mentioned the
fact that the Government was now paying a large
amountfrom day to day for expresses, which were
kept subject to its demand.
Mr. STANTON desired to ask the gentleman
another question: whether hedid not supposethat
these expresses had already performed their office
in carrying the Postmaster General's ^report?
[A laueh.]
Mr. BUTLER replied that he would refer the
gentleman to his own party for an answer, the
Postmaster General's report having been published
by them.
Mr McLANK proposed to the gentleman from
Pennsylvania to strike out Mr. Winthrop's name,
so as to leave two blanks, and provide for filling
them by nomination, which, he said, a majority
of the House could do.
Mr. KAUFMAN moved to lay the resolution
on the table.
The question being taken, the motion was
agreed to without a division.
" On motion of Mr. WENTWORTH, (he House
then again proceeded to vote for Speaker.
The roll was then called the twenty-seventh
time, when the tellers reported that the whole
numbef of votes given was 225; necessary to a
choice 113; of which—
