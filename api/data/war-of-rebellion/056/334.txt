Major-General HURLBUT:

The prisoners all say they have no infantry that they know of nearer than Canton. There is a column now 4 miles south of here.

The cavalry are now skirmishing with them; said to be in force, but I don't think so. If they attack they will be whipped sure. I have sent for construction train to return here.
