Watch the movements toward Martinsburg closely, and when your scouts which you have sent to ascertain the strength and designs of the enemy return let me know.

Yours, truly,

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

Brigadier-General KELLEY:

The 100-days' men ordered to be sent to Columbus, Ohio, as soon as their term of service expires, will be replaced by other troops as soon as the present emergencies will permit.

By order of Brevet Major-General Crook:

Assistant Adjutant-General.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS,

Cumberland, August 20, 1864.

It was desired and expected that the regiments of the Ohio National Guard serving in my command would be promptly relieved and sent home to be paid and mustered out of service at the expiration of their term of enlistment, but the exigencies of the public service demand that they remain a few days longer to enable the Government to collect and send troops to relieve them. I regret exceedingly that circumstances require this course toward these gallant regiments which have been so efficient and have rendered so important and valuable service in this department. I have made, and will continue, every effort possible to have you relieved, and I trust your detention will be of but a few days' duration. I therefore appeal to your patriotism to submit to this delay with the noble self-sacrificing devotion to your country you have heretofore evinced.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.

CUMBERLAND, August 20, 1864.

Colonel STEVENSON,

New Creek:

It is reported that a force of about 400 rebels were in Springfield this a.m. Keep your scouts active and well out.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brevet Major-General.
