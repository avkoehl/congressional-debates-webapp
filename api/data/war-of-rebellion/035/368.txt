It is important that you advise me promptly if your party is cut off or fails to reach Nashville, and also if telegraphic communication is cut off between Nashville and Murfreesborough, and where the break is, if it can be ascertained. Hold yourself ready for any emergency. The rebels are reported to be advancing with two divisions of infantry and artillery in proportion; also nine brigades of cavalry. Total, about 25,000 men.

Major-General.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
