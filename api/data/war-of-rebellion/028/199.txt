General R. B. MARCY:

It is no important to have a regiment of cavalry at Unity, Cooksville, and Damascus, that I shall send one from here, unless you can assure me there will be one at Mechanicsville very soon. This will make me short-haded here, but the right flank is, I think, now the one to be looked after. Please reply.
