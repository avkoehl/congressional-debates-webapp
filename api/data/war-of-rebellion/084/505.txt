Governor YATES,

Springfield, Ill.:

Alton being in my department, the authority given me by the War Department to call out volunteers I think will justify me in calling for a regiment of troops from that vicinity, and, with your permission, I will undertake to do it. You request about Seventeenth Illinois will receive my urgent attention. Arms were ordered ten days ago. Letter about captain and quartermaster received. Please answer.

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

SPRINGFIELD, ILL., August 1, 1864.

Major-General ROSECRANS:

I have already applied for authority at Washington to raise a regiment to do guard duty at Alton during the war, but receive no answer. Will you please communicate to me, by mail, in the morning stating the terms of your authority? There is a question as to how it would affect the draft. Could you confer upon me the authority to raise the regiment for you?

RICHARD YATES.
