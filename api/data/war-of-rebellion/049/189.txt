HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, CAVALRY CORPS,September 15, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel C. ROSS SMITH,

Chief of Staff, Cavalry Corps:

COLONEL: Colonel Gray, commanding pickets at Somerville Ford, reports that the enemy are constantly throwing up intrenchments opposite the ford and have four field batteries in position. Their people from the rifle-pits are firing upon my men by volleys. I shall strengthen my pickets at the ford. He also reports a large number of camp fires in rear of the batteries. I shall also strengthen my pickets at Robertson's Ford. The enemy have planted a battery of six guns at this ford.

Very respectfully,

J. KILPATRICK,

Brigadier General of Vols., Commanding Third Division.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1863-9 a. m.

Commanding Officer Second Corps:

I wish you would send word to Pleasonton to examine the banks of the Rapidan with a view to select some one or two points where a passage can be forced by pontoon bridging, and where the enemy are not now prepared to resist. These points should be between the railroad and the mouth, so as to turn the enemy's right flank. Of course this examination must be made so as not to attract their attention. If you could spare Roebling for this purpose I should be obliged to you.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

SEPTEMBER 15, 1863-1. 50 p. m.

Commanding Officer Twelfth Corps:

The commanding general directs that in the course of to-day you concentrate your command at Kelly's Ford prepared to cross the river. You will, however, leave a thin line of pickets as far down as Ellis' Ford.

Please acknowledge.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
