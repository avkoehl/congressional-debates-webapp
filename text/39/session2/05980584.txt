ORDER OF BUSINESS.
Mr. HARRIS. I move that the Senate
Sroceed to the consideration of Senate bill,
ro. 438.
Mr. WADE. I hope not. I hope we shall
proceed to the consideration of the unfinished
business of yesterday; that is, the bill to
authorize the extension of a branch of the
Baltimore and Potomac railroad into this
city. I suppose it will not take long to dis-
pose of it, and there is a reason why it should
be acted upon at once. It is the unfinished
business. I do not know what bill the Senator
proposes to call up; but there is a reason why
this one should be considered and disposed of.
Mr. HARRIS. I have a small bill that I
have been desirous of having action upon ail
this session, but still I will not press it against
the Senator's wishes.
Mr. SUMNER. I should like to call up the
resolution that I offered yesterday, which is
merely asking for information, and have it
acted upon.
Mr. HARRIS. The bill that I have moved
to take up is a bill for the relief of the heirs of
John E. Bouligny. However, I will waive my
motion until the bill of the Senator from Ohio
is disposed of.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The mo-
tion of the Senator from New York is with-
drawn.
Mr. WADE. I move to proceed to the con-
sideration of the unfinished business of yester-
day.
"" The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The un-
finished business of yesterday is House bill No.
598, being the bankrupt bill. Senators in
favor of the motion to proceed to the consider-
ation of the unfinished business, being the bank-
rupt bill, will say " aythose opposed, "no."
The motion was agreed to.
The Secretary read the title of the bill >as fol-
lows : A bill to establish a uniform system of
bankruptcy throughout the United States.
Mr. W ADE. I do not know how that bill
comes up in preference to this other bill;
but I will move to postpone all prior orders
and take up House bill No. 888. I do not
suppose it will take long to dispose of it.
Air. SHERMAN. I suppose the misappre-
hension grew out of my colleague moving to
take up the unfinished business of yesterday
instead of the unfinished business of yesterday's
morning hour.
Mr. WADE. The unfinished business of
the morning hour, as I understand, is the bill
which I have in my hand, House bill No. 388.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The mo-
tion of the Senator from Ohio was, that the
Senate proceed to the consideration of the
unfinished business of yesterday, and the Chair
put the motion. That bill is House bill No.
598, to establish a uniform system of bank-
ruptcy throughout the United States.
Mr. WADE. Then, if there is anything in
that point, I will move to amend the motion so
as to proceed to the consideration of the un-
finished business of the morning hour 6f yes-
terday.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. Both mo-
tions were in order.
Mr. POLAND. I shall not object to the
gentleman occupying the time until one o'clock.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Ohio moves that the Senate proceed
to the consideration of the bill (H. R. No.
888) to authorize the extension, construction,
and use of a lateral branch of the Baltimore
and Potomac railroad into and within the Dis-
trict of Columbia.
Mr. LANE. I understood that the unfin-
ished business of the morning hour was the
bill in regard to the appointment of pension
agents. The morning hour certainly expired
when we were about to vote upon that bill.
Mr. WADE. The gentleman is mistaken.
This bill was up last in the morning hour.
Mr. LANE. The morning hour expired
when we were upon that pension bill according
to my recollection.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ator from Ohio names this bill House bill No.
388, and the Chair states the question to
Senate as being the motion to take up this bill.
Whether it be the unfinished business of the
morning hour or not, the Senator from Ohio
