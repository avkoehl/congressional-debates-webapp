(Received 12 m.)

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

Judge Handy, of the Supreme Court, has decided adversely to claim of State to men of the military age. Governor Clark desires to turn over the whole military force to Confederate service, with their present organization. Having no power to accent them in this way, I submit the matter for your decision. These troops are at the front. It would be injudicious to disturb them.

W. L. BRANDON,

Brigadier-General.

[Indorsement.]

Respectfully submitted to His Excellency the President.

H. L. CLAY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
