pressed, and directed that you send to him immediately what troops you could spare from Cincinnati. I cannot make the order more definite as to time or numbers.

H. W. HALLECK.

WAR DEPARTMENT, October 31, 1862.

Gov. ANDREW JOHNSON,

Nashville, Tenn., via Louisville, Ky.,:

Yours of the 29th received. I shall take it to General Halleck, but I already know it will be very inconvenient to take General Morgan's command from where it now is. I am glad to hear you speak hopefully for Tennessee. I sincerely hope Rosecrans may find it possible to do something for her. David Nelson, son of the M. C. of your State, regrets his father's final defection, and asks me for a situation. Do you know him? Could he be of service to you or to Tennessee in any capacity in which I could send him?

A. LINCOLN.

LOUISVILLE, KY., October 31, 1862.

Colonel A. STAGER:

A dispatch from General McCook to-night says Bragg is attempting by forced marches to reach Nashville ahead of our troops. A special states Bragg's intention is to push for Chattanooga for the purpose of advancing on Nashville. Has no provisions. Green River Bridge completed to-day.
