the fight. Take all the fighting men from the pack train. By the way, General Sheridan is terribly down on the size of your pack train; have it cut down. Have all your provost guards placed in rear to prevent stragglers going to the rear.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

General Sheridan's trains for supplies have arrived at Martinsburg, with 169 rebel prisoners and large numbers of destitute refugees seeking homes in Pennsylvania and Ohio. Shall I furnish transportation on Government's account? We ought to get rid of them.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Dispatch just received from Colonel Tolles, chief quartermaster, states Sheridan's army arrived at Woodstock this morning and will be at Strasburg to-day. Nothing further received.

JOHN D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS U. S. FORCES,Martinsburg, Va., October 8, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON,

Commanding District of Harper's Ferry:

GENERAL: This post is much in need of an organized force of cavalry, not only for escorts, but to be used as scouting parties. With a strong regiment that had some previous experience in this vicinity, I think much could be done to rid us of the guerrilla bands, which now cause so much annoyance and render transportation without large escorts dangerous. Should the matter meet with your approval, I would very respectfully request that a good cavalry regiment be assigned here.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. SEWARD,

Brigadier-General.
