is issued by the judge upon the exhibition of the libel, and the property is condemned upon proof of the facts charged. A suit in the same court may be brought against those who have succeeded in evading the vigilance of the officers. If this property has become the property of any of the officers of the United States or the camp followers, or is found in their camps, magazines, &amp;c., it will fall under the FIFTY-seventh article of the Articles of War.

As trading with an enemy is prohibited by the general laws of nations, the property thus acquired may be treated as still belonging to the enemy, and is disposable as other property taken in war. The act of sequestration provides for the disposition of this description.

This statement of the laws in force will sufficiently enable you to act so as to carry into effect their object.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant, for Secretary of War,

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Assistant Secretary of War.
