27th Cong......1st Sbss.
Removals from Office—Mr. McRoberts.
Senate.
be the policy of the Administration upon the sub-
ject of removals, with the odious s> stem of pro-
scription practised apon by it, one might well ex-
claim, "O! what a fall is there, my countrymen "
It shows that the eyes of their most prominent
friends have been in dim eclipse to the rea! mo
tives of the actors in power.
The late President Harmon m a speech at
Cleveland, is represented to have osed this lan-
guage:
"I see over the way a public officer although he may op
pose me, if he does so honestly and conscientiously, I shall be
the hut man to disturb him Before I would remove him for a
mere difference ef opinion, I would suffer my right arm to be
«evered from my body "
In his inaugural address, he said, speaking of
our Government:
"It can interfere with no one's faith, pi escribe foims
of worship for no one s observance, infL ct no pun
ishment but after well ascertained guilt the result
of investigation under rulen prescribed by the Csnsti
luttonilself These precious privileges, and those scaitely
less important of giving exprés ion to his thoughts
and opinions either by writing or speaking unrestrained
but by the liability for -injury to others and that of a full
participation in all the advantages which now from the Go
vernment, the Ccfcnowledged property of all the American
citizen derives from no chat ter granted by his fellow man '
And yet, within a short time aiter t'^ese «olemn
declarations were made, great numbei s of ourfel
low-citizess were removed aid proscribed, withou
a trial, without guilt, "the result of i vestigation
under rules prescribed by the Constitution itee f,
and in some cases where investigation, or even a
hearing, was refused Nay more, ' this precious
privilege," as the inaugural called it, of "giving
expression to thoughts and opinions, t y speaking
or writing," is in many cases known to be the sole
cause of removal
In regard to the late President, it is due to the
occasion to say, that I believe he had but little
nand in the infamous proscription carred on ra
his name He disclaimed it to so maü> men, and
upon so many occasions, that I mutt suppose it
was the work of others—of his cabim t, and who,
after his death, assumed to be his political adminis-
trators.
Mr. Tyler, the present President of the United
States, in a letter to some gentlemen of Charleston,
South Carolina, shortly before the election, used
this language as a reason for his preference for
General Harrison
"Because he regards the public offices of *he country as
created for the benefit and advantage of the people and not for
the political advantage of the President, and m that spmt, ut
terlydemes the right on the pait of the President to remove
from office one 'who is honest, capable, andfaithlul to the Con
stitution,' to make way foi another whose chief recommenda
tion is to be found in his being a noisy and clamerous dema
gogue and partisan "
la a paper put forth by Mr Tyler, upon bis at-
taining the Presidency, and dated the 9 h of April,
1841, he said:
"I will remove no mctimoentfrom ofhce who has faithfully
and honestly acquitted himself of the dutieb of 1 h (Hice ex
cept in such cases where such officer has 1 ei n <nulty oí a i
active partisanship, or by secret means—the le 3 man!) and
therefore the more objertionable-has given bis official mllu
ence to the purpose of party, thereby brmeing the pationage
of the Government m conflict with the freedom of elections
And then to carry out the farce, and as if de-
signed to insult the feelings of those who were 10
be proscribed, he adds, ironically as we must be-
lieve-
"Freedom of opinion will be tolerated the full enjoyment of
the right of suffrage will be maintained as the birthright of
every American citizen, but I say emphatically to the official
corps, 'thus far and no farther '"
jjow has the freedom of opinion been tolerated
by this Administration'! How has the right ot su -
frage, this great birthright every American citizen,
been maiatamed? Why, sir, proscription has been
the daily reward of both Mr Barker, the late
talented Comptroller of the Treasury, and dozens
of others that could be named, are living evidences
of the truth of this allegation. Men h<tve been re-
moved without the shadow of complaint, except
their political opinions, which would not "be tole-
rated."
Sir, I am under nearly the same impressions
with regard to Mr. Tyler, that I entertain in regard
to General Harrison. I >hink it impossible that
he could be the author, or could sand n, or evtn
know, of many of the odious movements of the
Cabinet. These are my reasons Mr Tyler was
once a decided Demoerat, a champion f the State
Rights doctrine, an opponent of ihe Bmk of the
United States on constitutional ground", and in
every thing a disciple of Jefferson     He has never
made any public declaration of his apostacy from
these principles, and we must therefore treat him,
for the present, as of the <ame political faith     It
woiuld be expected that a Chief Magistrate, mak
ng   important   appointments,  would select men
who at least concurred with him upon great consti
tutional quesaons.   But how is it with the great
body ot the recent appointments'  Are they Demo-
crats? Are they State Rights men' Are they of the
school of Jefferson? Na, sir, not one, so far as I
know or have heard     The men who concurred in
opinion with Mr Tyler upon constitutional ques-
tions, have been removed, and followers nf ihe old
Federal paity, or latitudmanan constructionist? of
the Constitution have, with but few exceptions,
been appointed in their places     There is another
reason     The removals hpve progressed so rapid
ly that no one man could hive examined the ap
plications    In the Post Office Depar'ment alón",
the work of removal would keep one man   busy
These thin"5 induce me to mppose that the system
of proscription nowragine, is t e work of the Ca-
binet far more than the President.
I new ask the attention of the Senate to a brief
notice of the Post Offic  Department I ask this
the more especially on account of the unparalleled
proscription in that Department
The head of it, while a member of the House
of Represent?tives, voted in various instances with
the partv ca'led Abolitionists He voted against
the resolutions introduced by the Hon Mr
Atherton, and which were designed to prevent the
further agitation of the subject of Abolition In
1837, a resolution was introduced into the House
of Representatives m these words
' Rpsclced That any membei who shall heieaf er piesent
any petition fr>m the slavts of this lino ought to be consi
dered as re°ar Uest, of the feeling of the House, the rights of
the Southern State* and unfriendly to the Union "
Mr Granger voted against it
I have information from the most undoubted
sources, that postmasters at subordinate offices,
and uniform opponents of Abolí ion have been re-
moved, and Abolitionists appointed in their p'aces
Por mary >ears, it has been the ¡ule i f that Da
partment to publish a weekly list of the removed
and appointed postmas ers. This salutary regu
lation has, from motives best known to the Post-
master General, been discontinued We are there-
fore deprived of the opportunity of in pecting the
list If that hit were published as heretowe, we
could =ee who are the favorites of the present head
of the Po«t Office Why was the publication of
the list of re-novais and appointments discontinued1
Why depart from a rule so convenient, as well as
=0 just to the whole country?
S r, these thing-, are ominous, and especially
whrn removals are charged to '>«ve be«n m-de ai
the rate oi cne hundred and dnrty peí week This
furnishes an addi tonal reason why wt shouM í ave
the list furnished during the present sts.ion It is
the business of the Somh more than any other part
of the county, to look to this subject
Sir, the Slate which I have the honor m part to
represent has but few negroes, either free, or owing
service Our steady opposition to Abolition, in all
its forms, has not b en prompted by any personal
interests It has been of a higher, ¿nd I believe I
may «ay, a nobler sentiment It bambeen prompt-
ed by tue highest motives of patriotism, and an
unwavering; devotion to the union of the States
In order to prevent the estabhshmen' of Abo-
lition presses m that State, and whicn could have
had no otner effect than to anno} our fellow-cm-
zens of Missouri on the one side, and those of Ken
tucky on the other, jou will all recollect to have
heard of the «cenes of violence that ensued. Upon
one occasion, unfortunately several lives were lost
In the legislation of the State, in the conduct if
her public men, and of the great body of hsr cm
zens, Illinois has shown a firmness and a nnammi
ty in resisting that dangerous delusion, Abolition,
worthy of all commendation Yea more, no South-
ern man has. ever had just cause of complaint
against that State, or her authorities, for not
promptly awarding to him all his right . Nor is -ht
alone among the non-slaveholdmg States in main-
taining ihese principles Sir, let me tell Southern
Senators that the Democracy of the non-slavehold-
wg States have long since taken a stand upon this
subject. All that courage and honor, and law,
would sanction or permit, they would do to sus-
tain their brethren of tbe South, and to uphold the
compromises of the Constitution The/ could not
be driven by any state of circumstances to take
ground against you
But, sir, let me ask Whig Senators from the
South to contemplate the treatment which the De-
mocracy every where, but I b^heve more particu-
larly in the non-slaveholding States, are receiving
at the hands of the mongrel party njw in power
Look at the system of proscription, descending
down to petty p st offices at cross road . It is
well known that Democratic postmasters would
rot distribute Abolition t'ocuments It is also
known that the mails have olten been crowded
with thtm Are you sure lhat the unparalleled sys
t m of removals in that Department, now going on,
may find your post offices filled wiih men, a few
months hence, who will refuse to circulate Aboli-
ti n documents? This is the business of the men
of the Sonth But if that day ever com°s, (which
God forbid,) when Abolition is found to be the
road to political preferment, 1-tme tell joa, men
of the South, it will present itself under a new and
far more formidable aspect
A few words as to some of the persons pro-
scribed. Who are the men removed under the
Webster deciee? Borchard,Gardner, Luca , Dodge,
Jouea, Hackelton, Foreman, Milburn—but I will
not attempt to designate by name the vast list of
the proscribed.
A distinguished public officer who has been re-
moved, addressed a communication to Jonn Tyler,
the Presiden', and, m most respectful terms, ie-
questcd that, if any complaint, personal, political,
or official, should be made against him, all he
asked was to be permitted to know it, before any
action was had, and further informed the sa d John
Tyler that, unless he disproved every matter of
complaint, he would cheerfully take his dismissal
How was this manly lequest met' How should an
honorable man have met it, after Tyler'j, declara-
tion that he "v ould remove no int umbent from of-
fice who has faithfully and honest y acquitted him-
self of the duties of his office," except for activé
partisanship in tiectu hs?
Sir, I will tell }ou how it w s met Thegentle-
niiu was removed without a hearing, wnhout com-
plaint, and the office conferred upon "a noisy par-
tisan," m violation of Mr Tyler's own rule
Sir, I mo t nam" particularly a few of the pro-
scribed Colonel Hackelton was removed early m
March from the office 1 f regisier, at Dixon, m Illi-
nois. He was an able, fa thful and punctual public
officer Tne Geneial Land Office bears testimony
to iMs. As a man 'e «as without reproaih His
political opponents admuthpt he "ould not be justly
charged with ' aclive paiti anship" m politics Ac-
cording; to the pledge of the President, therefore,
he could not be remt ved Yet, in tha face of all
this, he was without notice and without trial
struck from the rol s as soon as Federalism got ¡nto
power.
Col Milburn, the Surveyor General of I lino s
and Missouri, is another of tae proscribed That
office is one of great importance to the people ot
tho?e States, and m such an office not only talent
but expenerce is of the highest importance Col.
Milburn has been connected with the office, first ?s
a sur/eyur, then as a cierk, and as chief c erk for
many years, and afterward as Surveyor Qereial.
His knowipjge of its multifatiius duties is superior
to that of any other man At the General Land
Office he is> regarded as not surpassed by any Sur-
veyor General in tbe United States, as a public offi-
cpr and a citizen he is sa d not to have an enemy
in the world He has given the highest satisfac-
tion in the discbaige of all his official duties, and
the Whig press of both tho e Stat, s admit that he
was not a partisan in politic  A leading Whig
journal, which I hold m iiy hand, says
" it is conceded by all our fuenls that the late Surveyor Ge
neral was honest c ipable antfuhfilir thcdischage of his
duty and while acting as a Government officer, scrupulously
abstained from an 0 n xious interference m elections ' "His
removal is theiefoie in lirec t viola'ion of one of the leadm?
principles for which as a parly we c intended, that no man
should be proscribed for opinion o sake '
