Meherrin River.--Over the Meherrin River, about twenty miles north of Weldon, is a covered bridge about 310 feet in length. The guard on the 1st instant consisted of forty-two men of Louisiana Zouaves, armed with muskets, and twelve commissioned officers. Also a detachment of thirty men of Captain Bradford's (Mississippi) battery and a detachment of fifty men of battery connected with Colonel Griffin's Sixty-second Georgia Regiment, Lieutenant Dees commanding detachments, the whole under command of Colonel Coppens. There are extensive works on the south side. I directed earth-works for artillery to be thrown up also on the north side of river, more completely to protect the approaches to the bridge from that side. Five pieces of artillery there-two heavy bronze 12-pounders, two brass 12-pounders, and one small howitzer. The reserves of the counties of Southampton, Greenville, Surry, Sussex, and Brunswick were ordered to rendezvous at this point (Hicksford). There were seventy-five reserves there on the 1st instant; the whole will not probably amount to more than 300 men. They were being organized under direction of Colonel Garnett.
