These propositions are made, first, to equalize the different brigades as nearly as the exigencies of the service will admit at present; second, to give the command of brigades to ranking officers, and, third, to brigade and locate the command at such points as most require the services of cavalry. This question of location has been submitted to the district commander and meets his acquiescence.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. R. WEST,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Cavalry.
