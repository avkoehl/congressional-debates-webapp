During the remainder of the month-that is, from the 14th instant-the sickness in the command experienced an increase, not so much in the number taken sick as int he gravity of the cases. the diarrhea, the prevailing disease, became very obstinate, and was accompanied with very great and rapidly increasing prostration, resembling the disease as seen during the Peninsular campaign of 1862. The fatigues of recent active service, the bad water in the Second Division, but more than all, I believe to be the origin of this, the lack of vegetables. Since camp near Hatcher's Run was broken pu until the present time only one or two rations of potatoes have been issued, and none of any other vegetables, except to a portion of the command a small quantity of beans. this has been all, a quantity insufficient to prevent the occurrence of scorbutic symptoms. No "well-marked" cases of scurvy are recorder by the medical officers, except in one or two instances of men order of importance, was pneumonia. In the Second Division hospital a number of cases of measles were threaded. The disease was brought to camp by some recruits. Two cases of smallpox occurred, one having contracted the disease at City Point depot, the other at the Burkeville army hospital. They were immediately isolated, and are progressing favorably.

On the 20th instant a train of twelve ambulances was dispatched to Amelia Court-House with supplies for some wounded rebels quartered there, and to transport such of them as were in proper condition to endure it to the Farmville hospital. On the 29th the Confederate hospital at Farmville, under charge of Surg. O. J. Evans, Fortieth New York Volunteers, having been ordered to report to the medical director, Second Corps, a train of ambulances was sent in order to carry a hundred of the inmates that were so far recovered from their wounds as to be able to travel to their homes, which were reported to be in or near Petersburg, Va. They were brought to Burkeville and placed on the cars for the city. On the same night 3,000 rations were ordered out to supply the necessities of those still remaining in hospital, 650 in number, of whom twenty-seven were Union men unable to be removed on account of the character of their wounds.
