Brigadier General C. DEVENS,

Commanding Twenty-fourth Corps:

Make every effort by scouts, deserters, and prisoners to ascertain what troops have moved from the enemy's left. About 1,200 infantry, four pieces of artillery, and 300 cavalry have been seen going down the road to Petersburg this morning.

General WEITZEL:

On careful examination of the picket-line it is found that part of a regiment apparently moved last night. This at the place where it was recently reported some change. The whole picket-line is the same as heretofore. Men are seen the same behind the line. On the last fort on the right we see a considerable number of men. Two of my staff officers at different times have examined the line this morning. Colonel Adams will send out scouts as directed.

General DEVENS,

Commanding Twenty-fourth Corps:

Thirty-eight car-loads of troops passed by the railroad to Petersburg to-day. Do you know of anything to indicate that they left our front? Have you any deserters?

Brigadier-General SHEPLEY:

Division officer reports that the enemy are moving a body of troops, say 500, from their left toward their right. This opposite our cavalry pickets on our right, near the Darbytown road, perhaps the same body reported by the scout on the Charles City road.
