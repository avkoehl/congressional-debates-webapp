The marching during these nine days was the most severe I have known in all the campaigns of this army. The roads were for the most part deep with mud; and the Fifth Corps, operating most of the time with the cavalry, constantly traversed the country by by-roads, on marches averaging from twenty to thirty miles a day.

Though the events of the campaign have called for but little use of artillery in action, the rapid marching and bad roads have necessitated incessant labor on the part of the battery officers, and still more on the part of those of my staff, to all of whom I am indebted for valuable services rendered.

Following in support of the cavalry, this corps has done little in the way of picking up abandoned guns and material. At the battle of Five Forks the united corps captured five 3-inch regulation guns of United States manufacture and three caissons. These guns I had hauled to Warren's Station, and turned over to the quartermaster there for transportation to City Point. The caissons were destroyed.

On the 3rd of April three light 12-pounder guns were found abandoned in a swamp near Namozine Creek, which I hauled up to General Sheridan's headquarters and turned over to his quartermaster.

I submit herewith report of casualties, losses, and expenditures on the campaign.*
