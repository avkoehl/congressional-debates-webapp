against Wagner on account of the distance and the fact that their fire endangers our own men in the advance. Five, I am informed, have been already injured.

The first I consider the best plan, for so long as the enemy are strongly entrenched in Fort Wagner they will give us serious annoyance and have an excellent base from which to assault our works, which they must now more than ever be convinced is their only hope.

The destruction of Fort Wagner would give us possession of the whole of Morris Island and probably Fort Sumter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. B. BROOKS,

Captain, and Assistant Engineer.
