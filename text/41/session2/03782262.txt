THE CONGKESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 28/
During the last year of the Johnson admin-
istration, from March 1, 1868, to March 1,
1869, (counting by months and rejecting frac-
tional parts of a motith for convenience,) the
receipts of the Treasury were as follows:
From customs S176.200.C92 79
From internal revenue 155,138,1GS 99
From other sources   30,929,656 99
$368,268,518 77
This was the maximum collection of that
Administration during its last year, when it
had the fullest and most ample experience.
Now compare with this General Grant's first
year, with many new officers unused to the
business in hand, uuaccustomedto the exaction
of public burdens, and see the result.
The income of the Government from March
1, 1869, to March 1, 1870, was—
From customs $179,956,713 85
From internal revenue  175,467,141 0!
From other sources  39,535,213 93
$394,959,098 82
or an increase of President Grant's first year
over Johnson's lastof $26,690,580 05, of which
over $20,000,000 is in the internal revenue
alone ; and this, too, in the face of the fact that
in the last year there were large reductions
of taxes in the internal revenue laws, and to
that extent lessening the sources of revenue.
Of the internal revenue over $75,000,000 were
collected from spirits, tobacco, and fermented
liquors alone. To what,then, must the increased
revenue he attributed V Plainly to the execu-
tion of the laws; to the efficient manner in
which they have been enforced, although most
of the officers were new men and unused to the
business. Great credit is due to the present
able and efficient Commissioner of Internal
llevenuu, aided and supported as he has been
by the Secretary of the Treasury, for this large
increase of revenue. A complete and thor-
ough reorganization of that department has
been made with a view to defeat frauds and
combinations to cheat the Government, and
more vigilant collections for the coming year,
as well as to relieve tax-payers from needless
requirements. The same efficiency lias been
introduced by the Secretary of the Treasury
in the collection of the customs revenue. Frauds
have been detected and great and valuable re-
forms have been introduced in that important
branch of the public service.
But, Mr. Chairman, the story were but half
told if 1 stopped here, having simply shown
tlie great increase in the revenues, and so 1
proceed to show that not only have the receipts
increased but the expenditures of Ihe Govern-
ment have been largely diminished. Owing to
the manner in which the accounts are kept,
and the delay in the receipt of full returns at
the Treasury from the various disbursing offi-
cers, I have not been able to obtain complete
statements of the expenditure for the whole
year, and so I present them for the eleven
months from March 1, 1809, to February],
1870, as compared with the corresponding
eleven months of the Johnson administration,
from March 1, 1808, to February 1, I860.
Aggregating the expenditures for these periods
I find the figures to he :
Total expenditures from March 1, 1863, to February
1, 1869, were  $527,007,284 53
lotal expenditures from March 1,1809,
to February 1, 1870   271,927,303 09
Doereasoin eleven months  S55.139.981 44
or a reduction of $5,000,000 a month and
$60,000,000 a year, equal to the interest on
$1,000,000,000 of the public debt.
It is nut necessary to go into a detail to show
how this reduction of expenditure has been
brought about. The figures themselves are the
best evidence of what has been done. They
show that there has been an earnest effort,
which has been eminently successful, to re-
trench the expenses of the Government and
carry it on economically. Over §1,500,000
l ave been saved in the reduced exnenses of the
collection of internal taxes alone under its pres-
ent management.
All the heads of the Departments are united
in the determination with the President to
reduce expenses and retrench abuses in every
possible form, and are working earnestly to that
purpose and to accomplish that end.
1 am in hopes, from the spirit manifested in
this House, that the expenditures of the cur-
rent year will be much less than those of the
last. Justice to the people requires that we
should also scrutinize carefully every item of
expenditure, and impose upon our constituents
no greater burdens than are absolutely neces-
sary to carry on the Government and preserve
the public faith plighted for the public credit.
I have shown, Mr. Chairman, in the first year
of President Grant's administration, as com-
pared with the last year of Johnson's, an—1
Excess of receipts of. $26,690,580 05
Add for llmonthsadeerease of expend-
iture amounting to  55,139,981 4-1
Total saving $81,830,561 49
And how has the money thus saved been
applied ? The monthly debt statements show.
In the act of February 20,1862, which created
the five-twenty loan, that loan which attested the
faith of our people in the national existence and
saved the life or the Republic, there was a pro-
vision requiring a sinking fund to be created
for the extinction of the public debt, to which
should be applied annually 1 per cent, of the
amount of the principal of the public debt.
This provision of the law had never been at-
tempted to be enforced until the present Ad-
ministration came into power. During the
war, when new loans were being constantly
called for, it was impracticable to comply lit-
erally with the law ; but it was not attempted
by the Johnson administration.
It is well known that when Mr. Boutwell
took charge of the Treasury portfolio this
sinking fund existed only in the law and not
in fact, but he promptly proceeded -to carry
out the law; so that there is now in the Treas-
ury, as shown by the statement of March 1,
1870, bonds to the amountof $100,659,292 01,
counting both principal and accrued interest
to 1st March, for the benefit of the sinking
fund. The tables I have already preseuted
show the reason why the Secretary has been
able to secure this large amount of bonds and
practically to extinguish this amount of the
public debt. If wo examine carefully the public
debt statements of March 1, 1809, and March
1. 1870, we still find the actual decrease of
the public debt at the latter date to be $87,-
131,782 81. If to this sum we add the accrued
interest (iucluded in Mr. Boutwell's but omit-
ted in Mr. McCulloch's statement) and the
premiums on the bonds purchased for the
sinking fund we find the actual reduction of
the debt to be $105,979,195 66. Another thing
is worthy of notice. On March 1, 1869, gold
was 131 ; on March 1, 1870, it was 111, and
our bonds in Europe about par.
Surely the Republican party can be satisfied
with this exhibit and record. The Govern-
ment has been one year in its hands, and the
public debt, without increased taxation, is
reduced $105,000,000. With such results in
one year we may confidently expect in the
futuie such a gradual reduction of the debt,
and its funding at a much lower rate of inter-
est on long time, as to greatly relieve the bur-
den of taxation from the people.
This price of the nation's life must every
dollar be paid. But, in my judgment, it is
not good policy to continue the present taxa-
ation to reduce tlxe debt so largely as during
the year just closed. I would pay off' a much
smaller sum, and to that extent relieve the
people from taxation. This generation has
already sustained heavy burdens to save the
life ofthe nation. Let the next one, which will
be much more numerous and wealthy, pay off
the greaterpart of this great public debt incurred
for their benefit as well as ours. I would re-
duce the custom's revenue at least $30,000,000
and take it from articles of necessary and com-
mon use, as much as possible, not produced in
this country ; and reduce the: internal revenue
at least $30,000,000, .'abolishing most ofthe spe-
cial taxes and also many of the stamp duties
upon small contracts ana notes and receipts.
But, Mr. Chairman, I do not intend now to
discuss questions of'tariff'-or taxes or finance.
I only desired to present these general facts as
to thfe manner in which the Republican party
has so far redeemed its plighted faith with the
people, and to show that it can be trusted for
the future, and that the interests of the people
are safe in the hands of this great party and
that it is worthy of their confidence.
Mr. McKENZIE. Mr. Chairman, I am in
favor of protecting American industry. My
business as a merchant ought, perhaps, to have
induced me to favor free trade ; but being a
groat friend of Henry Clay's policy from boy-
hood up, I thought the proper manner of devel-
oping and building up the resources of the
country was to protect our own industry against
the pauper labor of foreign countries. I re-
member well the great Tippecanoe contest in
1810, when the enthusiasm of the country was
aroused to the highest pitch, and when the
Democracy was so much astonished that out
of the twenty-seven States then in the Union
old Tippecanoe carried twenty-one, leaving
Van Buren and his policy but six, and some
of them very small indeed; and the thing was
considered so ridiculous that in our rejoicings
the Democracy, except the office-holding por-
tion of them, joined with us. Then came the
contest of 1844, when all expected the election
of the gallant Harry Clay; but lo, at a late
hour of that eventful night in November came
the sound as a' death blow-to all, the Whig's
hopes, "Who is James K. Polk?" answered
by the words, "President of the United States."
In 1840 the duties were $15,000,000; free
list, $57,000,000; dutiable, $49,000,000. In
1841, duties, $19,000,000; free list, $66,000,-
000; dutiable, $61,000,000. In 1842, duties,
$16,000,000; free list fell off that year to
$80,000,000; dutiable, $69,000,000. In 1843,
duties, $10,000,000; free list, $35,000,000 ;
dutiable, $29,000,000. Mr. Polk's term, 1845,
duties, $31,000,000; free list, $22,000,000;
dutiable, $95,000,000. In 1846, duties,
$27,000,000; free list, $24,000,000; dutiable,
$96,000,000. In 1847, duties, $23,000,000 ;
free list, $41,000,000; dutiable, $104,000,000.
In 1848, duties, $32,000,000; free list,
$22,000,000; dutiable, $132,000,000. In 1866,
duties, $179,000,000; free list, $69,000,000:
dutiable, $375,000,000. In 1867, duties,
$176,000,000; free list, $39,000,000; duti-
able, $372,000,000. In 1868, duties, $164,-
000,000; free list, $29,000,000; dutiable,
$343,000,000. In 1809, duties, $180,000,000;
free list, $41,000,000; dutiable, $395,000,000.
Although a friend of a protective tariff, 1
was never in favor of a high tariff', but one
ample to pay the expenses of the Government
and at the same time give incidental protec-
tion to American industry.
The result of the late struggle between the
two sections of the Union has settled the ques-
tion of ample protection to American industry
beyond cavil. The wants of the country to
pay the interest on the public debt, to pay the
pension list, to pay the expenses of an extended
country, the Army and Navy, the civil list, and
the many calls-constantly made on the national
Ireasury to develop the country, must satisfy
all parties that the duties on imports ior many
years to come must be high. The object,
therefore, ought to be as fast as possible to
reduce the public expenditures to a peace plat-
form. The iron interest, great as it is to-day,
is to be greatly extended; the opening up of
the rich beds of ore in Virginia has hardly
commenced; there is enough there to supply
the world, let alone what is in Pennsylvania
and other States. I apprehend Virginia will
never be a large manufacturing Sfate, at least
