[Major-General MEADE:]

I have been here for some time. Have seen no pontoon train at Jones' Bridge; no troops. Captain Mendell is here with his battalion. There are a few cavalry pickets here.

F. M. BACHE,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

NEAR JONES' BRIDGE, June 13, 1864-2.30 p.m.

[Major-General MEADE:]

The head of General Wright's column is within a couple of miles of Jones' Brigade. General W. says he has come along without any obstruction and saw nothing of General Burnside's column near the church [Emmaus]. The pontoons are by this time being laid.

F. M. BACHE,

Captain and Aide-de-Camp.

WESTOVER CHURCH, June 13, 1864-6.45 p.m.

General WILLIAMS,

Adjutant-General:

SIR: I have the honor to report that I have made a reconnaissance to this place without meeting any of the enemy. I have sent forward two picketing parties-one in the direction of Malvern Hill, the other toward Saint Mary's Church-with directions to send a scouting party as far as practicable before dark. Captain Adams, First Massachusetts, thought he could reach Malvern Hill before dark. The works of General Franklin's corps I find in good condition and quite extensive.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

EWD. S. JONES,

Lieutenant-Colonel Third Pennsylvania Cavalry.

P. S.-A man by the name of Folkes, living in this neighborhood, tells me that yesterday there was an encampment of South Carolina cavalry on Crew's plantation at Malvern Hill. They picketed at Salem Church, but their pickets were withdrawn last evening.

Brigadier-General BENHAM:

The major-general commanding directs that all pontoons and other bridge material in your possession be brought immediately to Fort Powhatan.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
