According to this table, Mr. President, which I
have made out with great care, it will be seen that,
in 1817, when our population was nine millions,
the income was 26£ millions instead of 22 j, which
it should have been: that in 1820 it was 15 millions
instead of 24; in 1821 it was 13 millions instead of
25; in 1825, instead of 27 millions, it was 20; in
1830 it was 22 millions instead of 27; in 1835, we
had 13^ millions instead of 37j—being just the one-
half of the product of 1817! In 1840, we had 20j
millions instead of 42j; in 1841 it was 10 millions
instead of 43; and in 1843, with a population of 18§
millions, we wound up with 17J millions of dollars
instead of 46|!
These tables speak a language which cannot be
misunderstood, and they place in the strongest con-
trast the working of the two systems during the two
periods: the beauty and advantages of one, and the
deformities of the other, standing out in the boldest
relief. In the first period, amplitude of amount,
steadiness of the product, and regularity of the in-
crease, strike every beholder. In the second period,
all this is reversed: confusion and madness seem to
reign in our treasury. Sometimes millions too
much—then not half enough. Sometimes sur-
pluses to be distributed-—then deficits to be supplied.
Giving away one day—begging or borrowing the
next. Always a feast, or a famine—never the right
thing. Our poor treasury become a balloon—some-
times soaring above the clouds—then dragging in the
mud—now bursting with distension—now collaps-
ingfrom depletion.
The miseries of the high-duty system we have all
seen and felt, and now see and fell; in the deplorable
condition of our finances—a debt of near thirty mil-
lions created—loans to defray current expenses—four
times a resort to treasury notes—and now an illegal
and fraudulent issue of a paper money currency.
Compared to the termination of the low duty system
at the end of Mr. Jefferson's administration, and how
does it stand? As confusion, misery, and deformity
stand to order, beauty, and happiness. Mr. Jeffer-
son's administration required an expenditure nearly
equal, and, population considered, more than double
what we require now; and the customs produced all
that was wanted, and to spare; for the lands pro-
duced but little. The interest and principal of the
debt of the revolution was then to be paid; the in-
terest of the Louisiana purchase had to be met; a war
with the Barbary powers had to be kept up; a mil-
itary peace establishment, larger than the present in
proportion to our population, was kept up; and the
revenue for all this expenditure, amounting to seven-
teen or eighteen millions of dollars, came from the
customs, with a population of only seven millions,
leaving every year a real surplus in the treasury.
But let Mr. Jefferson himself present this picture
He presented it to the two Houses of Congress in
his last annual message, and never was a time moie
fit to look at it again than the present. He said:
"It is ascertained (hat the receipt* have amounted to near
eighteen millions of >lo]l.-ut>, which, with the eight millions
and a half m the treasury at the beginning of the year, have
enabled us, after meeting the current demands, and lineiest
incurred, to pay two million thiee hundred thousand dollars
of the principal ot our funded debt, and left us in the treasury
on that day near fourteen millions of dollars. Of these, five
million three hundred and fifty thousand dollars will be neces.
sary to pay what will be due on the first day of January next,
which will complete the reimbursement of the eieht per cent
stock. These payments, with those made m the six years and
a half preceding, wilt have extinguished thirty-three million
five hundred and eighty thousand of the principal of the funded
debt; being the whole which could be paid or purchased with-
in the limits of the law and of our contracts; and the amount of
principal thus discharged win have liberated the revenue from
about two milhona of dollars of interest, and added that sum
annually to ihe disposable surplus "
Such, Mr. President, was the working of the low-
duty system—ample and steady revenue—no loans,
no taxes, no paper-money—33 millions and a half
of public debt paid in eight years—a surplus of 14
millions left in the treasury—the result not of lands
exchanged for paper, but the regular result of
steady revenue, strict economy, and hard money.
How different from the state of things under the
high duties of the present day! Instead of paying
above thirty millions of public debt in eight years,
we have created near thirty millions in fjur years;
instead of a surplus in the treasury, there is a de-
ficit; loans and taxes are the order of the day; and,
to crown all, we have an illegal and fraudulent issue
of federal paper-money currency, issued by execu-
tive power, and sustained by bank alliances. Such
is the difference between the working of the two
systems after twenty-five years trial of each!
Upon this view of the question, I submit, Mr.
President, that I have made good my first assertion,
and demonstrated the superiority of law duties over
high ones, in all that relates to good and wholesome
revenue, the amplitude of its amount, the steadiness
of the supply, the regularity of the increase.
2. i proceed to the next assertion—the superiority
of low duties over high ones, in relation to their ef-
fect upon agriculture and foreign commerce. These
two interests, in our country, go together, and the
state of one is a good index to the other. The ex-
ports make the imports, and agriculture is at the bot-
tom of the whole. The tables of exports and im-
ports for the two periods which we contrast, will
show how agriculture and commerce fared during the
continuance of these periods, and to these tables I now
have recourse. And here I will premise that I fully
understand the nature of our neutral position during
the wais of the French revolution, and the effect
which that neutrality had in promoting imports for
re-exportation. We re-exported much from 1791 to
1807, and have re-exported exactly as much from
1817. to 1844! Mexico, South America, and the
West Indies, have opened new markets for our
re-exportations; and it is a fact, proved by the
custom-house returns to be the same. Five hun-
dred and twenty millions of dollars are, as near as
I can ascertain from the most careful research, the
amount of re-exportations for each period; so that
in a comparison of the foreign trade in each period,
they may either be both omitted or both included,
as the speakei pleases. Finding them included in
the tables, I choose to use them in that way. The
table of revenue has already settled the question in
favor of the large amount of foreign goods which
remained in the ceuntry for consumption. Duties
were only paid on the amount so remaining; and a
revenue of sixteen or seventeen millions of dollars
from customs, with the low duties then paid, show
that the importations for home consumption were
greater then than now.
I will now show the tables of exports for these
two periods; and they will be found (each in its
place) to be characterized by the same features
which distinguish the corresponding revenue—the
same large amount, steady progress, and regular in-
crease ill one period—the same excesses and defi-
ciencies, risings and fallings, and violent fluctua-
tions in the second. Here is the table of the first
period:

Observe, Mr. President, the regular and onward
course of our exports during this period—always
advancing, always increasing. Bagmning in 1791
at twenty millions of dollars for four millions of peo-
ple, they advance gradually and regularly to ope
hundred and eight millions in the year 1807, for seven
millions of people. This table shows every thing that
is desirable in a regular, flourishing, and prosperous
commerce. Now let us look upon the next one.
Behold it:

Here we have it again, sir! The counterpart of
the income from customs during the same time: the
same plunging and floundering, the same incessant
and violent fluctuation. Commencing at eighty-sev-
en millions of dollars in 1817, for nine millions of
people, these exports sunk as low, in 1821, as sixty-
four millions of dollars for ten millions of people.
Then they swell up to ninety-nine millions; then fall
back to seventy-two millions; then dart up to one
hundred thirty-two millions, and fall back, in 1842,
to one hundred and four millions. At this amount
they stand now, being about the same they were at
in 1808, when the population of the country was
little more than the one-third of what it is at present,
when the cultivation of the country was not more
than a third of the present cultivation, and when, the
great article of cotton (now amounting to two-thirds
of our exports) was but a small item m the list of
exported articles. Taking these circumstances into
consideration, and the decline of agriculture, and of
the foreign commerce founded upon it, becomes ap-
palling. Leaving out cotton, and the agricultural
exports are less now than they were in 1808. They
then amounted to forty-eiglit millions: they only
amount to about one hundred millions now, of which
cotton is near two-thirds.
Such is the general view of our agriculture and
commerce under the high duty system, and under a
tariff incessantly altered for political and mercenary
objects. It presents a deplorable picture of their
decline; and not only of their decline, but of their
ruinous revulsions and convulsions. Viewed in de-
tail, and in relation to its effect on particular articles,
and the miserable picture becomes still more deplo-
rable. Thus: The rice exportation, 111 Mr. Jefferson's
time, was at an average of two and a half millions
of dollars per annum; it has since fallen as low as one
and a half per annum, and is now under two millions.
Flour, in 1807, was exported to the value of eight
and a quarter millions; under the high tariff it has
fallen as low as three millions; has been under five
millions for half the time since 1817, and is now at
seven and one third millions. Indian corn and corn
meal were exported to the value of two and a half
millions annually, under Mr. Jefferson's adminis-
tration: in one half the years under the new sys-
tem, this export has been less than one million of
dollars, and is now not equal to what it was forty
years ago. Wheat, in 1807, wa.s exported to the
amount of 776,000 bushels: From 1817 to the present
time, the export of this grain has only once risen as
high as 400,000 bushels; has twenty times been
under 100,000, and four times has been less than
5000 bushels. Tobacco has shared the gen-
eral fate of other agricultural products, and
