Point to see General Grant as to my next movement, when I shall return to Goldsborough. Goldsborough is an admirable point, but military reasons call for my army up the Roanoke, where we can be supplied by the Roanoke and Chowan Rivers and the railroad from Portsmouth to Weldon. Let me know by telegraph as soon as possible how many narrow- gauge locomotives and cars are laready sent. It is too late now to send any more.

I resepctfully recommend that Captin Giesy, assistnat qaurtermaster, Fifteenth Army COprs, be assigned to take cahrge of forage at Goldsborough. I have not heard fromthe laborers promised in a former dispatch from you. The opreation of unloading barges is much deallyed in consequence. Cannot you send a pioneer company for a few days! The brigade left here does not number 900 men. These are employed mainly in picketing, guards, &amp;.,
