JNO. K. RANKIN,

Lieutenant and Aide-de-Camp.

WASHINGTON, September 26, 1864.-11.15 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

General Seymour is a man of too many prejudices for the delicate task of inspecting west of the Mississippi. He would make up his opinion without proper examination. Franklin and Baldy Smith are better suited. Colonel Marcy has made a partial report. Colonel Sackett is now inspecting. General Canby has also been directed to send an inspector. If you think another should be sent, and cannot spare Colonel Babcock, I would recommend Smith.

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

An officer of rank and experience should be sent by you to investigate alleged frauds and inefficiency in Arkansas, and especially at Fort Smith and the Indian Territory. General Grant has given Smith full discretion to act with his command as he may deem best against Kirby Smith, Price &amp; Co.
