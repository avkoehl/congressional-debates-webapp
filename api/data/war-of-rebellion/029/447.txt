little hope. I will also send out as directed on Jefferson pike. I hope to hear from you to-night. My headquarters will be about 1 1/2 miles north of La Vergne, on Nashville road.

What about the heavy firing toward Nolensville?

Respectfully,

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE.
HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, December 27, 1862.

COLONEL: I detached (as ordered) Colonel Hazen, with the Second Brigade, Second Division, down the Jefferson pike, supported by a battery and battalion of cavalry. I sent with him a guide, and placed the First and Second Brigades, Third Division, Van Cleve's, at the junction of the Jefferson pike with the Murfreesborough road. Very soon after leaving the Murfreesborough road the firing commenced, and continued with but little intermission until almost dark. The guide sent has just returned with a verbal message that he had taken, and now holds, the bridge, camping just by it. Colonel Hazen lost several killed and wounded, with 3 or 4 cavalry taken prisoners by the enemy, and took 7 prisoners. As soon as accurate details are returned by Colonel Hazen I will promptly report them.

Most respectfully, your obedient servant,T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE.
HDQRS. LEFT WING, ARMY OF THE CUMBERLAND,One mile and a half North of La Vergne, December 28, 1862-2.30 p.m.

COLONEL: Have this moment received your two dispatches, asking if all my division had moved, and where General Stanley was. I came on with the division, which marched in the center. Van Cleve was to follow, and I doubt not is close up. We have been skirmishing over the last 3 or 4 miles; had 2 men wounded and captured several prisoners. Have had a brisk cannonading here, in sight of La Vergne; no one hurt as yet on our side, we moving up cautiously. some reports of infantry in sight, but not well authenticated.

Respectfully,

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General.

Colonel J. P. GARESCHE.

Chief of Staff.

P. S.-Have heard pretty sharp cannonading toward Nolensville for about one hour, beginning about 12 o'clock.

HEADQUARTERS LEFT WING, December 29 [28?], 1862.

COLONEL: I have the honor to inclose the reports of General Hascall and the officers of his command.

A very difficult task was very handsomely performed on yesterday
