Major-General McCLELLAN:

General Porter's division returned to camp at 6 p. m . Brigade went about 1 mile beyond the Half-way House, nearly 4 miles beyond Big Bethel. His skirmishers, some of Berdan's sharpshooters, went near to Howard's Branch, at Howell's Mill, where was seen a breastwork. Three deserters who came in yesterday morning from Yorktown report that General Magruder was there with nearly all his force, about 8,000 men, having left a guard of but 500 at Yorktown and in the batteries at Shipping Point. Our cavalry drove in their pickets, but captured none, their horses being too fleet. General Smith's division followed the road near James River from Newport News, encamped for the night at Watt's Creek, and returned to this camp yesterday morning. He reported a strong force at Young's Mill. From the best information I can obtain General Magruder has between 15,000 and 20,000 men under his command.
