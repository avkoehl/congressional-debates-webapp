to fortify, and will require a division at least to defend it. As a short time, however, to Easport and the terminus of the Northwestern Railroad on the Tennessee, it is not without a certain value as an entrepot for Nashville during low water in the Cumberland, and therefore we shall have to keep it up.

Sixth. Smithland and Paducah: In the present condition of things Smithland and Paducah are of great importance-one as the outlet of the Tennessee, the other of the Cumberland. First rate officers should be at both points, and if such are not available, a common head should be over both, to reside at one or the other points.

Seventh. Railroads: The road to Chattanooga has been damaged by the recent freshest at various points this side of Murfreesborough and in the great bridge across the Tennessee at Bridgeport. We hope to get the line in order in a week-that to Decatur in a fortnight, and that to Johnsonville in about the same time. In the meantime the quartermaster's department has not been caught napping either at Knoxville or Chattanooga, as we have this day at the former place some 34,000 sacks of grain and at the latter place 45,000 sacks of grain-a satisfactory supply, all things considered. We have also plenty of clothing and tentage at both of these points, and shall have an ample supply for the department when estimates now in are filled.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. L. DONALDSON,

Bvt. Brigadier General and Chief Quartermaster, Dept. of the Cumberland.

Captain ROGERS,

Commanding Division of Mississippi Squadron:

CAPTAIN: I have received information that a number of rebel scouts have a rendezvous on Seven-Mile Island, at the lower end, from which place they are in the habit of communicating with the north and south banks of the river. As I have no facilities for capturing the party, I would respectfully request that the first boat you send up the river be instructed to examine the island and arrest any person found upon it.

I am, captain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
