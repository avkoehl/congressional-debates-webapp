Brigadier-General STONE,

Chief of Staff:

My outpost of 10 men at New River was attacked and perhaps captured last night. Captain Craigue went to pursue, and a force also from here at 5 a. m. I am taking other measures. I heard yesterday evening that some 200 rebels were the day before just above Comite. I suppose them the same.

Brigadier General C. P. STONE,

Chief of Staff, Dept. of the Gulf, New Orleans, La.:

GENERAL: When my party, sent yesterday for witnesses against Mr. Folger, was ambushed 5 miles from town I suspected something wrong. So many of the enemy have not been known to be so near since my command here. The object of the party was defeated. It appears now that it can be proved by a witness about going to New Orleans that a clerk of Mr. Folger had notice on Friday (5th), and was eager to communicate with these witnesses in the country. I suspected F[olger]'s case could not be well tried in New Orleans. I wrote the 3rd instant to Mr. Atocha, asking the appointment of a commissioner to take evidence here. No notice appears to have been taken of it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

P. ST. GEO. COOKE,

Brigadier-General, U. S. Army, Commanding.
