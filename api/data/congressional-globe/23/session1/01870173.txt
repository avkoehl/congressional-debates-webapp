and the amendment to it by Mr  Bouldin, to a¡
point a committee to mqune into the moral effects
of the pension system upon the community, and
how far it ought to be abolished or repealed
Ml CH1L10N ALLAN said lie was unwilling
to be theciuseofftuthei consumption of ture upon
thl3 sulject He understood that the House was
anxious to have it disposed of, as many lesolu
tions had Laen and would be oPe ed fui the con
eideration of the House He would, theieioie,
waive his right to speak on the subject, witn the
understanding that no gentleman should continue
the debate
Mr GILMER said he was extiemely anxious
that the amendment offered by the gentleman liom
Vnginia should be discussed
Mr ALL\N then moved the pieviousquestion,
with a view to asceitam the sense of the House
as to the contu uance of the discussion
Mi MASON, of Virginia, expiessed a wish
that the motion would be suspended till his col
league,therno\er oftheamendment,should appear
m his seat                                                t

So the resolution was adopted
POTOMAC BRIDGE.
Mr MERCER obtained leave to report a bill
from the Committee on Roads and Canals, author
izmg the constiuction of a bridge over the Poto-
mac, and repealing all former acts passed on this
subject, which was read twice
Mr M then moied that it should be referred
to the Commi tee of the Whole on the state of the
Union, as he consideied lha' committee the most
arpropiiate n which a measure was to be dis-
cussed by which a gi eat saving was tobe effected,
he also moved that theieport, with the accom
panying documents, should be primed
Mr McKENNAN remarked that, as he did
not see in his seat the chairman of the Committee
on the Distuct, he woula state that the improve
ment contemplated had originated with that com-
mittee, and hewould move that the subject should
be referred to it
Mr MERCER disclaimed having any intention
of trenching upon the lights of any committee,
and he explained that he felt it his duty—as the
Committee on Internal Impiovements were about
to adjust their improvements to n eet tne revenue
of the country, that as the expendituie about to be
undertaken, involved, he was* credibly informed,
the large amount of full thieemilhoi s, if not fhe
millions—to recommend the present propositon,
which would onl/ lequne JIJO 000 as sufficient
for every íeasonable ptnpo^e
Mr McKENNAN said he had every respect
foi the cfiautran of the Committee on Roads and
Canals, but neveilheless he could lot see why
any views which had been submitted to that com
mittee to create such a change in the constiuction
of the bridge could not be consideied by ihecorn
mittee in which it originated, and aftei detailing
the proceedings taken oy he Committee on the
Distuct, to (fleet thecorstiucuon of the bndbe,he
desired that their claim to ha\e ti e subject befoie
them should be iecogni7cd
Mi MEPCEU. remarked thnt the proceedings
Ind onginated in consequence of a lepoit to tne
House by Mi Wicicurn , which had, theieupon,
made an appropriation oi sixty thous nd dollars
foi the lepans of the budge, and of twenty thou-
sand doll is foi paiohasing the lights ot ihe com
pany Nothing was,however, done, and ihe Pies
ldent of the Um ed Slates lad repo-ted vanocs
p ars to Congress He was iseuied that the flan
<-ubseq lently adopted would cost fully five mil
lions to complete it, as proposed It was there
fme, a serirus consideration whether they should
determine to go on with it, or pioceed with what
was now recommended, the expense oi which
voa'd not amount to a year's mteiest of ihe cost
required foi the othei
Mi CHINN said, ltnever was the understand
ing of the House t lat the Committee on Roads
and Canals should have proceded to annul the
contracts that had been made for the construction
of the budge, ai d as theie could not be a doubt
that the Committee of the Distuct had, undei all
the circumstance , the most appropriate junsdic-
tioi over the sub|ect, he advocated the ítfeience
to it accordingly
Mr MANN, of New York, knowing theanx'
ety of the House to pioceed with the other ímpoi-
tant busiress be'ore it, and seeing that there was
such a \ariety of opm on on this subject, which
was likely to occur y their time, he would move
to postpone its fur hei consideiation until to
morrow , which motion pi evaded—ayes 86, noes

amendment to that pi viously submi ted by Mi
McDlmie, viz to add to the mo'ion foi refei-
ence the folio wing instructions to that committee
" Inquire ,nto the expediency of depositing the

Mr BOULDIN, of Virginia, having the floor
fiom the pievious day, lose and said
Sir, befoie I proceed to submit a few remarks—
and they shall be but few—on the ments of the
serious question which is now befoie the House,
I must revert to the íebuke which I, in all due hu-
mility, received tne othei da/ fiom my colleague,
[Mi   Wisf ]    Sn, he sia'ed, and he stated tiuly,
that, although Mr Randolph was a member
elect of this House, that fact had not been for
maily announced to the House Su,I am not
in the habit of taking any general remark what-
ever to myself, but when a general remark ¡a
made, and under such cacumstances as will apply
to no one else so appropriately as to myself, I am
compelled to do so Sir, my colleague did not as
kindly suggest that the thing ought to be done,
which another colleague [Mr Archer] most
kindly, and in the most delicate manner, through
another colleague, did suggest—that this ought to
be done and now, is it has become my bounden
duty, I must tell my colleague, and this House,
and, through them, my constituents, the reason
why Mi Randolph's death was not here an-
nounced B it, sir, I cannot tell the reason why
the thing so kindly suggested was not done, with
out telling what 1 have already told my friends,
and moie than one, what I should say if I done
that thing------
Heie it becomes our painful duty to state, that
Mr Bouldin, after some moments pause, was
obseived to totter and lean foiward upon the desk
from which he had beenaddiessmg the House, he
was se zeu with an apoplectic fit, and although
medical assistance was promptly rendeied, having
been earned into the esplanade and bled, the vital
spark had fled
The House adjourned on the instant
