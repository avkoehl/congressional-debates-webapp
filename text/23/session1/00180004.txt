THE PREblDENT's MESSAGE
Messrs WILKINS and GRUNDY, who had
been appointed on the joint committee to wait on
the President, reported, that they had performed
the duty to which they had been appointed, and
that he had informed them he would make his
communication at one o'clock, this day.
The following message was delivered by the
Private Secretary of the President, and read
Fellow-mtizeiis of the Senate and
House of Representatives:
On your assembling to perform the high trusts
which the people of the United States have con-
fided to you, of legislating for their common wel-
fare, it gives me pleasure to congratulate you upon
the happy condition of our beloved country. By
the favor of Divine Providence, health is again
restored to us, peaie reigns withm our borders,
abundance crownB the labors of our fields, com
merce and domestic industry flourish and increase,
and individual happiness rewards the private vir-
tue and enterprise of our citizens
Our condition abroad is no less honorable than
it is prosperous at home. Seeking nothing that is
not right, and determined to submit to nothing that
is wrong, but desiring honest friendships and lib-
eral intercourse with all nations, the United States
have gained throughout the world the confidence
and respect which are due to the character of the
American people, and to a policy so just and so
congenial to the spirit of their institutions.
In bringing to your notice the particular state of
our foreign affairs, it affords me high gratification
to inform you that they are in a condition which
promises the continuance of friendship with all
nations.
With Great Britain the interesting question of
our northeastern boundary remains still undecided
A negotiation, however, upon that subject has been
renewed since the close of the last Congress, and
a proposition has been submitted to the British
Government, with the view of establishing, in con-
formity with the resolution of the Senate, the line
designated by the treaty of 1783 Though no
definitive answer has been received, it may be daily
looked for, and I entertain a hope that the overture
may ultimately lead to a satisfactory adjustment
of this important matter.
I have the satisfaction to inform you that a
negotiation which, by desire of the House of Rep-
resentatives, was opened some years ago with the
British Government for the erection of light-houses
on the Bahamas, has been successful Those
â– works, when completed, together with those which
the United States have constructed on the western
side of the Gulf of Flouda, will contribute essen-
tially to the safely of navigation in that sea This
joint participation in establishments interesting to
humanity and beneficial to commerce is worthy
of two enlightened nations, and indicates feelings
which cannot fail to have a happy influence upon
their political relations It is gratifying to the
friends of both to perceive that the intercourse
between the two people is becoming daily more
extensive, and that sentiments of mutual good
will have grown up befitting their common origin,
justifying the hope that, by wise counsels on each
side, not only unsettled questions may be satis-
factorily terminated, but new causes of misunder-
standing prevented
Notwithstanding that I continue to receive the
most amicable assurances from the Government
of France, and that in all other respects the most
friendly relations exist between the United States
and that Government, it >s to be regretted that the
stipulations of the convention concluded on the
4,th July, 1831, remain, m some important parts,
unfulfilled
By the second article of that convention it was
stipulated that the sum payable to the United
States should be paid at Pans, in six annual in-
stalments, into the hands of such person or persons
as should be authorized by the Government of the
United States to receive it, and by the same article
the first instalment was payable on the second
day of Tebiimiy, 1833 By the act of Congress
of the 13m Julv, 1832, it was made the duty of
the Secietary of the Treasury to cause the sev-
eral instalments, with the mteiest thereon, to be
received from the French Government and trans
teir d to the United States in such manner as he
may deem best, and by the same act of Congiess
the stipulations on the part of the United States in
the convention were in all respects fulfilled Not
doubting that a treaty thus made and ratified by
the two Governments, and faithfully executed by
the United States, would be promptly complied
with by the other party, and desiring to avoid the
risk and expense of intermediate agencies, the
Secretary of the Treasuiy deemed it advisable to
receive and transfer the first installment by means
of a draft upon the Piench Minister of Finance A
draft for this purpose was accordingly drawn in
favor of the cashier of the Bank of the United States
for the amount accruing to the United States out
of the first installment, and the interest payable
with it. This bill was not drawn at Washington
until five days after the installment was payable at
Pans, and was accompanied by a special authority
from the President, authorizing the cashier or his
assigns to receive the amount. The mode thus
adopted of receiving the installment was officially
made known to the French Government by the
American charge d 'affaires at Paris, pursuant to
instructions from the Department of State The
bill, however, though not presented for payment
until the twenty-third day of March, was not paid,
and for the reason assigned by the French Minister
of Finance, that no appropriation had been made
by the French Chambers. It is not known to me
that up to that period any appropriation had been
required of the Chambers, and although a commu-
nication was subsequently made to the Chambers,
by direction of the King, recommending that the
necessary provision should be made for carrying
the convention into effect, it was at an advanced
period of the session, and the subject was finally
postponed until the next meeting of the Chambers.
Notwithstanding it has been supposed by the
French Ministry, that the financial stipulations of
the treaty cannot be carried into effect without an
appropriation by the Chambers, it appears to me
to be not only consistent with the character of
France, but due to the character of both Govern-
ments, as well as to the rights of our citizens, to
treat the convention made and ratified, in proper
form, as pledging the good faith of the French
Government for its execution, and as imposing
upon each department an obligation to fulfill it, and
I have received assurances through our charge
d'affaires at Pans, and the French minister plen-
ipotentiary at Washington, and more recently
through the Minister of the United States at Paris,
that the delav has not proceeded from any mdis-
positio" on the part of the King and his Ministers,
to fulfill the treaty, and that measures will be pre-
sented at the next meeting of the Chambers, and
with a reasonable hope of success, to obtain the
necessary appropriation
It is necessary to state, however, that the docu-
ments, except certain lists of vessels captured,
condemned, or burnt at sea, proper to facilitate
the examination and liquidation of the reclama-
tions comprised in the stipulations of the conven-
tion, and which, by the sixth article, France en-
gaged to communicate to the United States by the
intermediary of the Legation, though repeatedly
applied for by the American charge d'affaires,
under instructions from this Government, have
not yet been communicated, and this delay, it is
apprehended, will necessarily prevent the comple
tion of the duties assigned to the commissioners
within the time at present prescnbed by law
The reasons for delaying to communicate these
documents have not been expl.citly stated, and this
is the more to be regretted, as it is not understood
that the interposition of the Chambers is in any
manner required for the delivery of those papers
Under these circumstances, in a case so import
ant to the inteiests of our citizens and to the char
acter of our country, and under disappointments
so unexpected, I deemed it my duty, howevei I
might respect the general assurances to which I
have adverted, no longer to delay the appointment
of a minister plenipotentiary to Pans, but to de-
spatch him in season to communicate the result of
his application to the Tiench Government at an
early period of your session I accordingly ap-
pointed a distinguished citizen for this puipose,
who proceeded on his missio i m August last, and
was piesented to the King early in the mouth of
October He is paitieulaily instructed as to all
matters   connected  with   the   piesent  postule of
affairs, and I indulge tile hope that, with t! e rep
resentations he is instructed to make, rnd fiom
the dispositions manifested by the King at d his
Ministers, m their iecent assuiances to our Min-
ister at Paris, the subject will be early coiiMdeied
and satisfactorily disposed of at the next meeting
of the Chambers
As this subject involves important interests and
has attiacted a considerable share of the pjljl c
attention, I have deemed it propet to make this
explicit statement of its actual condition , and
should I be disappointed m the hope now enter-
tained, the subject will be again brought to the
notice of Congress in such manner as the occa-
sion may requue.
The friendly relations which have always been
maintained between the United States and Russia
have been further extended and stiengthened by
the treaty of navigation and commerce, concluded
on the 6th of December last, and sanctioned by
the Senate before the close of its last session
The ratifications having been since exchanged, the
liberal provisions of the treaty are now in full
force, and, under the encouragement which they
have received, a flourishing and increasing com-
merce, yielding its benefits to the enterpuse of
both nations, affords to each the just recompense
of wise measures, and adds new motives for that
mutual friendship which the two countries have
hitherto cherished towards each other.
It affords me peculiar satisfaction to state that
the Government of Spam has at length yielded to
the justice of the claims which have been so long
urged in behalf of our citizens, and has expressed
a willingness to provide an indemnification, as
soon as the proper amount can be agreed upon
Upon this latter point, it is probable an under-
standing had taken place between the Minister of
the United States and the Spanish Government
before the decease of the late King of Spam, and,
unless that event may have delayed its comple-
tion, there is reason to hope that it may be m my
power to announce to you, early in your present
session, the conclusion of a convention upon terms
not less favorable than those entered into for simi-
lar objects with other nations That act of justice
would well accord with the character of Spain,
and is due to the United States from their ancient
friend It could not fail to strengthen the senti-
ments of amity and good will between the two
nations which it is so much the wish of the United
States to cherish, and so truly the mteiest of both
to maintain
By the first section of an act of Congress passed
on the 13th of July, 1832, the tonnage duty on
Spanish ships arriving Irom the ports of Spam
was limited to the duty payable on American ves
seism the ports of Spam previous to the 20th of
October, 1817, being five cents per ton The act
was intended to give effect, on our side, to an
arrangement made with the Spanish Government,
by which discriminating duties of tonnage were to
be abolished in the ports of the United States and
Spain on the vessels of the two nations Pur-
suant to that arrangement, which was rarried into
effect, on the part of Spain, on the 20th of May,
1832, by a royal order dated the 29th of Apnl,
1832, American vessels in the ports of Spain have
paid five cents per ton, which rate of duty is also
paid in those ports by Spanish ships, but as Amer
ican vessels pay no tonnage duty in the ports of
the United States, the duty of five cents payable
in our ports by Spanish vessels, under the act
above mentioned, is really a discriminating duty,
operating to the disadvantage of Spam Though
no complaint has yet been made on the part "of
Spam, we are not the less bound by the obliga-
tions of good faith to remove the discrimination,
and I recommend that the act be amended accord-
ingly As the royal order, above alluded to, in-
cludes the ports of the Balearic and Canary Isl-
ands, as well as those of Spam, it would seem
that the provision of the act of Congress should
be equally extensive and that for the repayment
of such duties as may have been improperly re-
ceived, an addition should be made to the sum
appropriated at the last session of Congress for
lefunding discriminating duties
As the arrangement refeired to, however, did
not embrace the islands of Cuba and Porto Rico,
discriminating duties, to the prejudice of Ameu-
can shipping, continue to be levied thei e     From
