river in this vicinity, I am here with some force resting for the night. Whipped at Camden Point, Thornton probably moved south. Ford followed. Can you do anything to bag the rebels if they attempt to cross below here?

Lieutenant Manville, commanding at Independence, reports that the stage was robbed three miles west of that place this morning; horses and mail taken. He has no men to send after the guerrillas. I have not heard from Houts' command yet. Where is he? No news from Ford yet.
