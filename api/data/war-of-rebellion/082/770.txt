urge that our mortar batteries bearing on that front shall be ordered to open, in order to divert or silence the enemy's fire. I would also request that additional mortar batteries be placed in rear of Wise's brigade. If we could only get the wooden mortars, so long promised, they would doubtless be of great advantage to us.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, July 12, 1864.

Lieutenant Colonel E. F. MOSELEY,Commanding Artillery:

The enemy's mortar batteries are seriously damaging the left of my line, occupied by Wise's brigade; you will, if possible, divert the enemy's fire from that part of the line or endeavor to silence it; also communicate with the officers in command of our mortar batteries, which may be brought to bear on this part of our line, and see if they cannot afford us some relief.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, July 12, 1864-12 m.

Colonel GOODE,Commanding Wise's Brigade:

COLONEL: Please report promptly everything of importance on your line. Are the enemy damaging you with shell this morning? How are the spirits of your men? What progress are you making with bombproofs? You will see that your men only construct strong and secure bombproofs. Let the roof be supported by heavy timbers and strong uprights. Let the men be thoroughly in hand, and prepare them to be prompt in coming out of bromproof and manning the parapets when required. Should the woods in your rear be set on fire by shells or otherwise you will have the fire promptly extinguished. Should your line be attacked you will bear in mind that it must be held at all hazards. Of this every officer and man of your brigade should be duly advised. They should be all duly prepared and fully resolved, and success cannot fail to crown their courageous efforts.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS JOHNSON'S DIVISION, July 12, 1864-12 m.

Colonel PAUL F. FAISON,Commanding Ransom's Brigade:

COLONEL: You will hold your reserve regiment ready to support Wise's brigade if it should be attacked. Should the woods anywhere in the vicinity of your lines be set on fire by shells or otherwise you will have the fire promptly extinguished.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

B. R. JOHNSON,

Major-General.
