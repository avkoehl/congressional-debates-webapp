General GILLMORE:

I think your fire on Sumter may be omitted to-day. Have just returned from above, and am trying to get a little rest. I do not know what damage our fire did Sumter. My chief of staff wounded; his leg broken.

I wish to know if Sumter fired at the monitors last night while they were in action. Do not disturb the admiral if he is sleep, but please get me the information, as it will determine whether I continue firing on Sumter to-day.

GILLMORE,
