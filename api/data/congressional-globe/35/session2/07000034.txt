APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE,
[November 30,
35th Cong....2d Sess.
Report of the Commissioner of the General Land Office. Senate & Ho. of Reps.
the satisfaction of the Virginia authorities; where
there was no fraud or imposition practiced in the
presentation of the case; and where no evidence
has since been discovered showing that the party
had resigned, been cashiered, or suspended; and
where the register of the Virginia land office is-
sued the warrants to those legally entitled, for the
i proper amounts due, as shown by. the evidence
fbefore the Executive and Council, and by their
order of allowance.
Claims of "resigned officers," amounting to
46,018 acres, have been filed, but no definite ac-
tion touching the question of their admissibility
has yet been had.
The total amount of claims, under the said net
of 31st August, 1852, now on our files, and re-
maining unsatisfied, is 250,000 acres.
Prom a careful examination it is estimated that
all cases that can hereafter be presented, includ-
ing all outstanding claims, lands lost by interfer-
ence in Kentucky and Ohio, and including the
balance due of the ten percent, cases, under the act
of March 3,1835, will not exceed 150,000 acres.
Scrip has been is&ued upon United States iev-
olutionary warrants, under the act of May 30,
1830, to the amount of 900 acres.
" Virginia Military huiul District, Ohio."
This district, originally embracing 3,709,848
acres,has been appropriated, nearly in full, byen-
try, survey, and patent, in satisfaction of the Vir-
ginia Continental line warrants. It is estimated
that there are now 40,000 acres unappropriated.

These lands are of but little value, being small,
irregular, fractional pieces, and might be donated
to the State for educational or charitable purposes.
The act of March 3, 1855, fixing the time for
the survey of entries, in this district, expired by
limitation on the 3d March, 1857.
It is recommended that the claimants be al-
lowed to perfect their entries by survey, and to
receive patents therefor.
War of 1812.
The act of February 8,1854, which authorized
the issue and location of warrants granted for ser-
vices in the war of 1812, and of the Revolution,
expired by limitation on the 26th June last, leav-
ing many warrants outstanding and unsatisfied,
and, unless further legislation is had, they will
not be available for any puipose.
Patents have been issued for fifty warrants,
granted under this act, to the amount of 8,320
acres.
Patents for 480 acres have been issued under the
act of January 7, 1853.
This act, which authorized soldiers of the war
of 1812, where the lands originally patented to
I! them were found unfit for cultivation, to exchange
11 the same, expired by limitation, and should be
11 extended, enlarging its provisions so as to cover
■! cases of the hens-at-law of the soldier.

hibit the condition of the acts of 1849 and 1850,

Within the fiscal y^ar, ending; June 30,1858, the
selections reported for all the swamp-land States
amount to 1,395,587.41 acres. There have been
approved during the same period 1,290,831.66
acres; and patented within the same time, of these
and prior selections,J2,410,3l4.74 acres.
During the quarter ending 30th September,
1858, there have been approved 253,947.49 acres;
and within the same period there have been pat-
ented 3,045,568.99 acres.
Under the grant of 1849, peculiar to the State
of Louisiana, the aggregate selections from the
date of that grant, made and reported to this office,
amount to 10,660,398.33 acres. Under the gen-
eral act of 1850, the selections for all the swamp
States amount to 44,469,093.80 acres; making in
the aggregate, 55,129,492.13 acres, of winch there
have been approved and certified, under grant of
1849, 7,379,094.23 acres; and under the act of
1850,33,543,187.38 acres.
The approval and certification under the grant
of 1849, having the effect of a patent, the amount
thus acted upon—7,379,994.23 acres—will, with
the addition of the amount patented under the
graniof 1850,show36,096,828 34acres, for which
complete titles have passed, from the United States
to the several States interested.
Considerable progress has been made in the
preparation and transmission of lists of the lands
claimed, under the grant of 1850, but which have
been disposed of by the Government since the
date of said act; thus enabling the States to pre-
sent the proof required by the act of 2d March,
1855, and extended by the act of 3d March, 1857,
preparatory to receiving (he indemnity authorized
thereby. The grants made in aid of the construc-
tion of railroads piior to the confirmatory act of
3d March, 1857, where the routes of the roads
had been definitely fixed before that date, render
it necessary to withhold action upon all the tracts
in the granted sections within the six-mile limits,
and tracts in corresponding sections within the
six and fifteen mile limits, in order properly to
determine the character of the lands, and the dis-
position to be made of them. A period of eight
years having elapsed since the grants, and the
States still continuing to make selections, the sug-
gestion made in former reports, that a limit be
fixed to the time, within which the selections
must be made, is again renewed. This, indeed,
is a measure urgently called for,and being indis-
pensable, to avoid conflicts and quiet titles, is re-
spectfully and earnestly recommended.
RAILROAD GRANTS.
By the acts of Congress of May 15th and 17th,
3d^of June, 11th of August, 1856, and March 3,
1857, grants of land for railroad purposes were
made to Iowa, Alabama, Florida, Louisiana, Wis-
consin, Michigan, Mississippi, and Minnesota.
Iowa.—The grant to this State by act of May
15, 1856, is for four roads, parallel to each other,
traversing the State from east to west, connecting
important points on the Mississippi with the Mis-
stum river. The grant had been accepted by the
State, and transferred to companies, the lines of
route established, their six and fifteen mile lateral
limits laid down on the official plats; lists of lands,
(excepting in the Chariton district, now in hand,)
have been prepared with great labor; and, when
they shall have passed the necessary tests, will be
submitted for approval.
The following is an exhibit of the length of each
road under the grant, and the areas ascertained
for each, exclusive of suspended interferences:
