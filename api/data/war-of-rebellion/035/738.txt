while they may be brought to a sense of their duty, you will deal with them as gently as the heinousness of their offense will permit. It is thought that some of the insurgents are deserters from your armies.

So soon as the services of the State troops can be dispensed with, will you so instruct that they shall report at once to these headquarters for further orders? The company of the State Line will be provided for by its own quartermaster's department and commissariat. It will also take its ammunition with it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HENRY C. WAYNE,

Adjutant and Inspector General.

His Excellency JOSEPH E. BROWN:

SIR: The undersigned, citizens of Walker Country, are under the painful necessity of inviting your earliest attention to a most unfortunate state of circumstances now existing in the northwest portion of this county. Threats have been made that no Southern man shall raise a crop in that section of country. A Mr. William M. Coulter has been shot at; his house also entered and gun taken. On Wednesday night last the house of William B. Chambers was entered and his watch and arms taken. The men committing those outrages are harbored, as we are informed, by persons in the neighborhood. We make no comment upon the state of affairs alluded to other than to say, in our opinion, the peace, quiet, and safety of the persons in that region of the State demand prompt and vigorous measures to correct and put down such a condition of things. Permit us to suggest that cavalry would be the better arm to send. Your aid, as Governor of Georgia, is invoked.

We are, very respectfully, your obedient servants,

A. H. CALDWELL. S. MAYS, I. I. C.

JOHN M. McSPADDEN. GEO. W. ROWLS.

Major D. C. REED,

Assistant Adjutant-General, McMinnville, Tenn.:

SIR: I am ordered by the general to report that the enemy occupied Lebanon yesterday, their force consisting of seven regiments of infantry, three of cavalry, and two batteries. The force which drove our command from Liberty yesterday has retired to that place, and is variously estimated at from 5,000 to 10,000-infantry, cavalry, and artillery. The enemy now occupy Liberty.

Very respectfully, major, your obedient servant,
