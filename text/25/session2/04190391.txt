was idle and preposterous to suppose that the >us-
pensioa would not have taken place without it.
The approximate cause of that was the indebted-
ness of the banks beyond their mean's of payment,
and the withdrawal of the deposites, so far from
contributing to its increase, was the most effectual
measure that could be devised to arrest its further
progress Had the act not been passed, the indebt-
edness would have been vastly increased, and the
explosions and loss to the country and the Govern-
ment proportion bly severe As it could not be
averted, ti e somier it rarae the better, and admit-
ting the act acce'erated the c en', it may f iirly be
set down as one of its benefits

the act In the midst ol the vast profusion of
means, which the now expiring protective tariff
poured into the Treasury, the Government had lost

habit of profusion and extravagance had grown up

He foresaw the evil, and recommended, some
years since, in a report on Executive patronage,
the measure now complained of, as the only ef-
fectual remedy for the great and growing danger
He then saw clearly that nothing could reach the
evil, but the withdrawal of the surplus uvenue,
which could only be effected by placing it in the
custody of the States This the deposite act did,

Monroe's administration, which was charged with

Mr C said that his colleague had made an
objection agamst the constitutionality of this bill,
which he deemed proper to notice It was a rale
with him, where the Constitution is supposed to be
involved, to bestow his serious consideration befoie
he acted, and, if he saw reasons to doubt, not to
give his assent He had c mphed with the rule
in this case, and the result was a clear conviction
that the bill was constitutional The right had
been exerc ied from the commencement of the
Government without being bed re questioned, and,
according to his conception, came within the
powers etprcs )y grmtcd to Congress to bonow
money, which meant neithci more nor le^s thtn to
raise supplies on the public credit Intel est was
not essential to bonow ng, and it would be ndicu-
lous to 'oppose that the fiamer- ol the Constitution
intended to authorize the raising of supplies with
interest, and to piohibitit without it But we are
told thatTieasury not°s air bilK ol cudit, and that
the Constitu'ioi does not a ihoiizt Congiess to
issue bills of credit Fie did not deem it necess uy
to go into a formal discussion on either point He
denied that they were bills of ciedit in aiy propei
sense of those terms The) weie intended to raise
st pphes to meet a temporary deficit m the Trea-
sury, and were, in fact, nothing more than means

would bring it to a short and decisive issue with hi

colleague His colleague is the strenuous advo-
cate of the joint resolution of 1316, which authorizes
ths collection of the public dues in the notps of the
specie-paying banks, and has no scruples as to the
right of collecting in the notes of banks that do not
pay specie. Now, no one will deny that to autho-
rize the receipt of bank notes m the dues of the
Government, is virtually to endorse on each note
that it shall be received in the public dues, or that,
it the Government had the right to do the one, it
had the right to do ihe other Nor will it be
d>med, that if the Government has the right to
write on the back of a bank note, that it will be
received in the public dues, it has an equal right to
write the same on a blank piece of paper, or, which
is the same thing, to make a Treasury note The
truth is, that to authorize banknotes to be received
in the public dues, is neither more nor less than to
make them, to that extent, Treasury notes, and i\
j o tanto, as much the making and issuing such
notes as if done on a separate piece of paper If
the one be unconstitutional, the other is clearly so
Now, h  would make this bargain with his col-
league and other advocates of the connection with
the banks if they will give up the use of bank
paper by the Government, he would gire up the
ussr of Treasury notes, and if they will deny Ihe
con titutionahty of receiving bank notes, he would
not insist on the constitutionality of Treasmy notes,
and, in so doing, he should make a very good bar-
gain for the country But he was utterly unwilling
to admit a construction which, while it denied to the
Government the use of its own credit, would give
the monopoly of it to the banks

Acting Quartermaster  General,   undei date   of
April 25th, 1838, which says
"I have not been able to make a single remit-
tance of any consequence for the suppression of In-
dian hostilities for the last ten weeks, though the ex-
penditures through this department hai e heretofore
averaged full three hundred thousand dollars "
Another letter from the same officer, dated May
15 h, 1838, says- " I regret very much that it was
deemed advisable to propose the appropriation in
the same minute detail, which was attempted in
the estimate, instead of embracing all the objects
of supply, and services due from the Quarter-
master's Department, m the same amount, under
one general head, while I am quite sure that the
aggregate called for is not more than will be re-
quired. Some of the items will, no doubt, fall
short, and others exceeds the w ants of the service,
since it is impossible to estimate the expenditures
for armies engaged in active operations in the
field, under each separate head, with sufficient ac-
curacy for detailed appropriations In that enact-
ment, inconvenience will be experienced, unless
power be vested in the Executive to transfer from
one item to another, which I would respectfully
suggest, if the present form of the bill be re-
tained. I would also suggest the following modifi-
cations of the several items, without affecting the
aggregate amount
1st  For forage, say   -      -      -        $400,000
2d  For freight, or transportation, of
supplies, to the places of operation -          350,000
3d. For wagons, carts, &c.        -           150,000
4th For transpoi tation of supplies from
the depots to the points of consumption      700,000
5th   For hire of meehanics, laborers,
drivers, &c.....250,000
6th   For tiansportation, &c   of volun-
teer-,        ......100,000

charges     ......       750,000
