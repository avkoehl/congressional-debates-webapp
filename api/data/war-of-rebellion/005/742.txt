Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

I have given all the orders necessary for the movement, and soon start for Washington, merely to spend the night. I want to join my headquarters near Alexandria early in the morning . I could not heave my troops to-night until I had done all in my power to expedite the movement.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

FAIRFAX COURT-HOUSE, March 11, 1862.

General MARCY:

Telegraph to General Banks that the troops have all left Manassas, and probably the whole or the greater part of the troops have left Winchester, and that General McClellan desires that he push forward to that place as soon as possible, and hold himself in readiness to move with the whole or a part of his force on Manassas. In the order for the transportation to come to Washington do not include that for transportating wagons and animals from Perryville and Annapolis. Let them remain where they are, subject to other orders.

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General.

Having fully consulted with General McDowell, I propose occupying Manassas by a portion of Banks' command, and then at once last week. The Monitor justifies this course. I telegraphed this morning to have the transports brought to Washington, to start from there., I presume you will approve this course. Circumstances may keep me out here some little time longer.

Honorable E. M. STANTON,

Secretary of War:

Summer's division occupies Union Mills and Manassas to-day. I could not occupy it from Centerville, as roads thence to Manassas are impassable for artillery and wagons. General Sumner will cover re-
