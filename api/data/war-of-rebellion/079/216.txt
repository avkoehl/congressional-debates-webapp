Tuscumbia. The garrison at no time before I moved my headquarters here was less than 3,000. I would respectfully recommend that it be re-enforced by 2,000 until it is really certain that there is no design upon the post. The forces can then be easily transferred to any point desired. Lieutenant Hall, my acting aide-de-camp, returned this morning from half way to Courtland, bearer of flag of truce; states that he distinctly heard firing in the direction of Bainbridge and Florence yesterday. Colonel Wade telegraphs that General Morgan will be in Athens to-morrow with his DIVISION.

PULASKI, October 11, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding:

Dispatch of last night for General Rousseau just received; will forward same by special courier at once. Would respectfully suggest that it be forwarded from Columbia, as General Rousseau may be moving back to that point on his return, as per his last dispatch which I last sent you, and, if so, my courier may miss him. Colonel Sipes is commanding at Columbia. Colonel Thomas N. Pace, Tenth Indiana Cavalry, an old officer, would command in my place if youshould grant my leave. I do not wish to go, general, if any active movements are going on requiring my presence; otherwise would be pleased to go. Am also desirous of giving into your own hand certain documents for your inspection relative to late raids.

JOHN C. STARKWEATHER,

Brigadier-General.

PULASKI, October 11, 1864-5. 10 p. m.

Major-General THOMAS,

Commanding:

General Johnson arrived here this afternoon. I informed him of your orders. He is now on his way to Columbia; will reach there to- night. Your dispatch of yesterday ordering General Rousseau to cross the river was forwarded by courier as reported. Meeting General Croxton on his way in this direction, the general read it and indorsed upon the back the following:

NEAR HALL'S HOUSE, October 11, 1864-8 a. m.

At the instance of the courier I thought proper to open this dispatch, as he stated it was from General Thomas and related to the movement of troops engaged in the late (raid) expedition [sic], have reached Pulaski or will reach it to-day, and that General Rousseau is there. I had directed the courier to convey it to that point as speedily as possible.

JOHN T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General.

This was written seven miles south of Hall's house. General Rouseau not being here the dispatch in question has not been delivered; same was countermanded in fact by your last dispatch forwarded this morning. Colonel Roper and command were sent by General Croxton on from Waterloo to Nashville by any road he thought best. General Croxton thinks he moved by way of Waynesborough. General Croxton will camp at Pillow's Mills to-night; has sent to me for rations. General Morgan will be in Athens to-morrow with his DIVISION. Whereabouts
