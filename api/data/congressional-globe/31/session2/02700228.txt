THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
Jan. IS,
am in favor of a reduction of the rate of postage
from ten cents to a uniform rate of five cents. ,
Mr. POTTER. I was aware of that. 1 he
gentleman's amendment will speak for itself; it I
provides for a uniform rate of five cents for all dis- '
tances. Sir, it is the result of the gentleman's ,
proposition that I wish to avoid. Adopt it, and
instead of a reduction of postage, it would operate
only as a reduction of revenue. Four fifths of the
letters now carried in the mail pay only five cents;
it is only those letters carried over three hundred
miles that pay ten cents. My object is, so to re-
duce the postage upon all mailable matter as to
compete with the private expresses upon the short
routes. The gentleman's amendment will not
effect that object. It affords encouragement to the
increase of letters upon the short routes, or those
less than three hundred miles, from which nearly
all our revenue is derived. Private expresses do
not enter into competition with the Post Office De-
partment upon the long routes, and upon these the
gentleman's plan would certainly operate injuri-
ously to the revenue, whilst, it would produce no
change in the receipts upon the short routes.
Mr. CARTTER. I dislike exceedingly to in-
terrupt my friend, but if he will allow me, I wish
to submit to him and to the House, whether, after
the amendment I offered, and after the remarks I
submitted on a former day in reference to this bill,
the gentleman is authorized in coming to the con-
clusion that I am opposed to reducing the rates of
postage down to a revenue standard? I stated ex-
pressly in my remarks, that I was in favor of re-
ducing the rates of postage to a revenue standard.
I think my colleague does me injustice in coming
to the conclusion he does in this matter.
Mr. POTTER. Mr. Chairman, I will do my
colleague no injustice; for whilst I must be allowed
to comment upon his proposition, I will certainly
state it fairly. He says a uniform rate of five
cents is a revenue rate. I was only endeavoring
to show that the proposition, if adopted, would
only tend to diminish the revenue without accom-
plishing the great, end in view," the cheap circula-
tion of valuable information in every part of the
country.
I repeat, that the great object in reducing the
postage upon short routes, is to bring into the mail
the matter now carried by private expresses, as
well as to encourage the more general use of the j
mails, where they are now avoided on account of ,
the high rate upon letters. I
Mr. CARTTER. Is my colleague informed of j
the existence of any private expresses in the ,
vicinity of any of the cities in the State of Ohio, or j
in any western city ? i
Mr. POTTER. I am not. I will ask my col-
league, whether he is informed of the existence of
such expresses in the eastern cities ?
Mr. CARTTER. I am aware that^irivate ex-
presses exist in those cities. 9
Mr. POTTER. It is with these that we wish
to compete, by putting the rates, not as low as
they carry letters, for I believe they only charge
two cents, but at such rates as will tend to dis-
courage their use.
But to resume the subject. It is objected also,
that the Postmaster General will not grant mail
facilities, or service upon routes on which there is
not revenue derived sufficient to pay the expenses.
Can this be true? By the adoption of this rule,
Maryland would have to be curtailed over $30,000
Virginia, over  60,000
North Carolina, over  110,000
South Carolina, over  40,000
Georgia, over  60,000
Florida, over  15,000
Illinois, over.  40,000
Tennessee, over  10,000
Alabama, over  80,000
Mississippi, over  25|000
Arkansas, over  30,000
Texas, over  30,000
for each of these States fall short the above sums,
of revenue sufficient to pay barely the costs of
transportation of their mails, to say nothing about
the commissions paid to their postmasters.
• Mr. HAMMOND asked, whether in this esti-
mate the transportation of the mail through Mary-
land, &c., upon the great southern route to New
Orleans, was embraced ?
Mr. POTTER. I will do these States justice
in this respect, if the gentleman will only have
patience. But we do not ask to have this rule ap-
plied to these States. We protest against it, and
it is unfair to eharge that such a rule has been
adopted by the Department. It is true, that it is
a strong argument against putting increased service
upon a route, but I deny that it is any part or par-
cel of the regulations of the Department.
Mr. SWEETSER desired to know of his col-
league whether there were not post roads in Ohio
upon which no service had been ordered by the
Department?
Mr. POTTER. There may be, particularly
upon the routes established last September; and
perhaps some others where there had been no
competition in the bids for the service, and those
that were made were so exorbitantly high that it
would be unreasonable to ask for service at such
rates. But I regard the Post Office Department as
a branch of the National Government, necessarily
so for the connection and continuance of routes;
as one of the conditions in the bond of our Union,
strengthening its ties by a common interest, and
should be managed as a whole, regardless of local
divisions, any further than they may be necessary
for the promotion of the general welfare of the
people of the whole country.
But, sir, I have been treating this subject as if
the awful forebodings of the timid and wavering
upon this floor, of broken-down stage coaches,
lean horses, hungry drivers, deserted towns and
villages, grass-grown streets, lean and starved
I postmasters, and worst of all, a bankrupt Treas-
ury, were about to be realized.
I have a word of comfort for that class of our
friends. My colleague who first addressed the
committee upon this subject, [Mr. Cartter,] de-
clared that the effect of a reduction of postage
would be " to reduce the Post Office Department
to a state of bankruptcy." My friend snys that
he has come to this conclusion "from the little
examination he has been able to give this sub-
ject." I am sorry, for the sake of the measure,
that that gentleman has not brought his usual in-
dustry and acumen to the task of this examina-
tion, for I feel quite sure that had he done so we
should find in him one of the strongest advocates
of this bill.
Another of my colleagues [Mr. Sweetser]
says that this measure will ultimately charge the ,
Post Office Department upon the Treasury; but
he gives no reasons for it. He says, also, that
allusion has been made to the English system, but
he does not intend to discuss that, and dismisses
the subject by saying, " 1 will state, in general
terms, that we cannot assimilate ours to theirs,
and no legitimate argument can be drawn from
it." I might say of him, as I have already done
of my other colleague, that I am sorry, for the
fate of this bill, that he had not looked at the re-
ports of the British Post Office Department.
Mr. SWEETSER. In my argument the other
| day, I gave as a reason why the rate proposed in
i this bill was below the revenue standard, that the
bill itself asked for a million and a half 
Mr. POTTER. I do not want the gentleman
to make his speech over again; I cannot spare the
time allotted me by the rules of the House; he
can read it in the Globe. He spoke at length, and
| was complimented by the very general attention
' of the committee. This should satisfy my friend
i without my now giving him an opportunity to re-
peat it. I am sorry, however, that he has given
i this subject so little attention. Had he devoted a
little more time to it I do not doubt that instead of
his opposition, this measure would to-day have
his warmest support.
My colleague [Mr. Sweetser] challenges me
to bring forward my facts and figures to show that
the reduction of postage will not bankrupt the De-
partment.
I propose now to do it. I regret the necessity
that I am under to vindicate the measure here upon
this floor, and to spend the time of the committee
upon it; but what I say is said for the ear of mem-
bers, with the hope that those who are not preju-
diced against the oill, but are anxious to adopt, as
they say, " a revenue point," will listen, if they
1 have not examined the subject themselves, to the
facts that I intend to lay before the committee.
This subject has been so fully elaborated by the
1 gentleman from Missouri, [Mr. Phelps,] that I
will not trouble the committee with the details of
our own or the British Post Office, but will state
the general results:

From 1839 to 1849 inclusive, it is seen by this
table that under the old high rates of postage in
1840, the number of letters sent through the
United States post office was 27,535,554—receipts
#4,530,265; and there was a constant diminution
of letters and receipts from postages, down to
1843, when the number of letters had run down
to 24,267,552—revenue, #4,295,225; leaving, in
1843, an actual deficit in the department of #78,788;
and even then, as now, we found the gentleman
from Indiana [Mr. Brown] opposed to any change;
using the same argument then as now, that the
Department would be bankrupted by the proposed
reduction. The gentleman says he has been dis-
appointed in the result. 1 am sure, if he lives,
and the present proposed reduction takes place,
he will be again disappointed. I was a member
of this House in 1845, when the reduction was
made, and voted for it. That gentleman voted
against it. We have both been disappointed.
The effect upon the revenue has been more sahw
tary than any of us anticipated.
Before this reduction in 1845, the old rates were
twenty-five cents on the. single letter for the longest
distance and six and a quarter cents for the short-
est. We changed it to ten and five; and under
the operation of the reduction the number of let-
ters increased from 24,267,552 in 1843, so that in
1849 there were transported oyer 62,000,000, and
the revenue in the same period had increased
from #4,295,925 to #4,705,176, and in 1850 to
$5,552,971.
TheDepartment during this period has not only
sustained itself, but it has carried light, truth and
happiness to millions of our people, who under our
former system would never have been reached.
! Under our old system, the Department was only
known to the people by the exorbitance of its
charges, amounting almost to oppression. Under
the reduced system it has become the people's
friend, and is respected and fostered by them.
Now, instead of efforts to defraud the Department
of its legitimate revenue, you find an interest
everywhere felt in its maintenance. This is really
the only branA of the General Government whose
benefits are brought to the door of every citizen
of the Union every day of his life.
The gentleman from Indiana [Mr. Dunham]
says that " any argument drawn from the opera-
tion of the British Post Office, in support of a re-
duction in this country, is fallacious. '
Let us look a moment into it and see whether
he is right, first showing the results of the reduc-
tion. The postage upon all half ounce letters in
the United'Kingdom of Great Britain, for any
distance, is one penny, equal to about two cents of
our money. In 1839, the last year of their high
or old rates, the letters transported in the mail
amounted to 76,000,000. In 1848, under the re-
duction, 347,000,000.
In 1848, the gross revenue of the Department,
including everything, was... .t *2,181,016

expenses. It has been claimed by the opponents
of this bill that the money order office m Great
Britain was a source of revenue; but the returns
show that the commissions in 184S on money
