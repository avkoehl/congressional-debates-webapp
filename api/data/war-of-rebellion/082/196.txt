HEADQUARTERS THIRD DIVISION, July 12, 1864-1.50 p.m.

[General A. E. BURNSIDE:]

GENERAL: I am provoked to find that Lieutenant Spencer incorrectly reported the statement of Captain Alberger with reference to the cars. Fearing a mistake, I sent for the captain, who says the cars were running below Petersburg - that is, on the south side, and going and coming continually from about 10 o'clock till after daylight.

Very respectfully,O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General.
