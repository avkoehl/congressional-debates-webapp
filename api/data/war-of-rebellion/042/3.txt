COLONEL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to say that you will move at once to this point with the whole of your infantry and artillery, excepting Colonel Logan's regiment, which will remain at Olive Branch. Instruct Colonel Logan to resume the command of the outposts and put out his pickets and scouts, especially on the cross-roads from the Plank road to the Plains Store and Baton Rouge road, and also from the Plank road to the Plains Store and Baton Rouge road, and also on the latter road. If he is satisfied that the enemy are advancing with large force against this place by the Jackson road, and leave the cavalry for the defense of Clinton. The cavalry scouts will keep the enemy all the time in view, keeping between the enemy and Clinton, and skirmish all the time with his advance, as favorable opportunity occurs, making ambushes when possible, or attacking vigorously his advance when we are in numbers strong enough to do so.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
