JOHN. POPE,

Major-General.

FORT LEAVENWORTH, February 9, 1865.

(Received 1. 10 a. m. 10th.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I request authority to raise two companies of Indians in this department, to be armed, equipped, and paid by Government, and used as guides, scouts, &amp;c. One great difficulty I had, that we have very little knowledge of the hostile tribes and lack guides in following them up. I expect to open telegraphic communication by Sunday, and am now ready to guard stages to Denver.

G. M. DODGE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF SOUTHWEST MISSOURI, Springfield, Mo., February 9, 1865.

COMMANDING OFFICER CASSVILLE, MO.:

Send forward the Fayetteville train, unless you are positive that a large force of rebels are on the road to attack it. The wire remaining up is an indication that there are no rebels on the road. Send a good escort but do not detain the train unless the danger is great. Forage is a great item.

JOHN B. SANBORN,Brigadier-General, Commanding.

Company I, Forty-ninth Missouri Infantry, was only retained at Mexico long enough to transfer captured and contraband stock in their possession to the quartermaster, and they have not yet learned to move with the readiness of veteran troops.
