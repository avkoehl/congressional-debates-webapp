EXECUTIVE SESSION.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The joint reso-
lution (H. R. No. 521) repealing duty on coal
is before the Senate as in Committee of the
Whole.
Mr. FENTON. Without displacing the
pending joint resolution, or any other order
of business, I think we might now have a short
executive session. I therefore move to pro-
ceed to the consideration of executive busi-
ness.
Mr. TRUMBULL. I would not do that
now.
Mr. FENTON. I should be glad to have a
short executive session.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The motion for
an executive session does not displace the
pending business. The pending business will
be resumed after the executive session.
Mr. FENTON. It will be only for a few
moments that Ishall ask to detain the Senate
in executive session.
The motion was agreed to ; and the Senate
proceeded to the consideration of executive
business. After fifty minutes spent in execu-
tive session the doors were reopened; and (at
live o'clock and forty minutes a. m., Saturday,
