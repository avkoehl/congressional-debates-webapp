They were cooks in the Fifteenth Confederate Cavalry and deserted last night at 10 o'clock at the Seven-Mile Station. Colored Maury is there with 160 mounted men, and said that he would take breakfast in the navy-yard to-morrow morning. I am sure you will have not pills ready for them. They are repairing and building bridges on the several roads leading to us. Six hundred cavalry and 200 to 300 infantry are at Fifteen-Mile Station. They know of no more troops moving down from Pollard.
