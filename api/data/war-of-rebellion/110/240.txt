[General JOHNSTON:]

About 12 my advance guard engaged enemy's infantry between Woodsonville and Rowlett's Station. the enemy crossed over re-enforcements rapidly. Colonel Terry charged them with his rangers and was killed. Two others of his command killed, 2 mortally wounded, 6 wounded slightly; 50 to 75 of the enemy killed, 10 prisoners. Swett's battery and the companies of Marmaduke's battalion were also in the action. I have taken position here to reconnoiter. Expect to move to railroad to-night.

MONTGOMERY, ALA., December 17, 1861.

General A. S. JOHNSTON.

Bowling Green:

Tender from North Alabama come in slowly under your letter of 2d. Several companies have been ordered to Florence, and hope to have seven or eight companies from thatt region in a few days. There are delays from trying to get up a regiment instead of tendering by companies, understanding that if mustered in by companies they cannot elect their field officers. Another difficulty is arms. State arms exhausted, and Legislature refuses to pass laws to impress them. Am hurrying up, but fear it will be some time before any companies can be started to Bowling Green. To 500 slaves are ready. Have ordered a company to Nashville, which had just tendered.
