' This street was paved with Senoca stone, or blue stone, by the Board of Public Works in the summer of 1871, then repaved with asphalt as shown above.
Against these sixteen contracts the work
charged is $556,936 57, whereas the work
actually done and paid for, according to
the report of the board in another part of
this book, (although covered up and confused,)
amounts to $1,087,842 29. By these sixteen
extensions there is an addition of over $600,-
000 to the amount stated in their report, which
if carried through all, in the same proportion,
would double the expenses of the board and
augment, the $6,387,000 of admitted liabilities
to $12,750,000.
I will now point to another discrepancy so
gross 
[Herr> the hammer fell.]
The SPEAKER pro tempore, (Mr. Wheel-
er ) The gentleman's time has expired.
Mr. ROOSEVELT. I ask the House to
allow me a little more time.
Mr. CHIPMAN. I havfc no objection to
allowing the gentleman to conclude. I will
yield to hira ten minutes longer.
Mr. ROOSEVELT. I will now take up the
case of the Tiber creek seWer in detail, and
Bhow how many forms it takes according to
circumstances, and how it is turned to suit
different purposes. The cost of this sewer
is stated at $47,150 in the list of liabilities,
that being the amount according to the
original contract, at the rate of seventy-five
dollars a running foot, for a sewer of thirty
feet span. Nothing whatever in this report
shows that an addition has been made to
this, or the expense increased in any way;
and yet that contract, as was proved before
our investigating committee last spring, was
at once increased to §102 50 a foot. This
alone would augment the cost by $23,575, and
make it amount to $70,725. So there you
have misstatement number one. But that is
not all.
The board state in their rteport (page 8) they
have built a Tiber creek sewer 2,473 feet
long, with thirty-feet span, which at $102 50
per foot comes to $253,482. In other words,
there is a discrepancy of $200,832.
But even this is not the worst of it, for we
next get beyond the region of discrepancy and
error, and reach that of willful perversion. On
my motion there was adopted in this House,
December 4, 1872, a resolution directing the
Board of Public Works, after they had made
out this report to the President, to furnish us a
further report, showing the entire amount of
indebtedness they had incurred ; that is to say,
the amount of contracts they had made, also
the amount of work not done under contract,,
and the sum required to complete the work
they had undertaken. In the report sent to us
in answer to that resolution the same Jist of
contracts is taken, word for word, without any
addition except a few trivial suras, leaving the
result substantially the same. But fearing ex-
posure in this particular matter, for it was a
thing that everybody would know, and which
would be brought at once to the attention of
the House, they have added a list of what they
term "extensions since November 1, 1872."
Now, bear in mind their first report was made
November 1, and in it they say this work was
done. In their supplemental report they give
what they call an extension of the same con-
tract, as though it was Work then just com-
menced, and in thfise words: "November 2:
amended so as to embrace the sewering of
Tiber creek, from Indiana avenue to North
Capitol street, Bartlett & Williams, $109,-.
162 50." This misstatement is worse than the
former, because it is manifestly intentional,
and what is more, will not answer its purpose.
The $47,150 in the report to the President,
added to the $109,047 admitted by the supple-
mental report, will not make $250,000.
The skill of these gentlemen in manipulat-
ing figures does not seem to be equal to their
skill in managing the public property in this
District. There is still a discrepancy of
$94,000, which is nowhere accounted for or
explained, and nowhere is there areference to
the Tiber creek sewer from Pennsylvania
avenue to Indiana avenue, which cannot be
much less than one thousand feet in length.
The board forget such trivialities as $94,000.
In strewing millions about as freely as they do,
a hundred thousand or so would readily slip
away " untalked of and unseen."
I shall not go through the other fourteen
contracts, as there are no essential points to dis-
tinguish them from those I have considered; but
as confirmation of my conclusions, I may add
that the subject of these extensions has been
examined by gentlemen in this city, and while
1 cannot vouch for their investigation as cor-
rect, I can state, what I have no doubt will be
to the satisfaction of gentlemen on the other
side of the House, that good Republicans have
informed me the amount omitted in that report
is $9,000,000. That agrees with the judgment
I have formed, and again brings us to the same
conclusion we have obtained by our former
calculations, that in addition to tike $6,000,000
in the list there are nine millions of contracts
which have not been extended and which
remain as debts against the city, making the
entire debt incurred by the Board of Public
Works $16,000,000, instead of $6,000,000.
Allow me to add, v^liile I q.m on this sub-
ject, that this list of contracts is not certified.
While the clerk puts a certificate in the ease
of every trivial expenditure he has not certi-
fied to these, involving millions, which looks
like a curious piece of forgetfalness on his part.
We will now proceed to another branch of
this fruitful aubject. Gentlemen will recollect
Congress only a few weeks ago appropriated
$1,240,000 as tfte share which the United
States should pay for the improvements of the
District of Columbia. This amount was based
upon the theory that the national Government
should pay five sixths of the cost of the work
along the public property, and a statement of
such work is, submitted in the report the
President. I never believed in the theory
propounded, but if that statement is to be the
guide I will show frauds against the Govern-
ment of a character which will astonish gen-
tlemen who hear me. The amounts set forth
on the last page of the report—and, by the by,
let me say this report has been changed and
reissued, that page having been omitted as
tellipg unwelcome truths—assume to show
the expease of doing a certain kind of work,
making it very sniall under the Board of Pub-
lic Works as compared with the late city gov-
ernment. In this page they give the cost of
brick pavement at ninety cents a yard. Now,
gentlemen, they have charged the United
