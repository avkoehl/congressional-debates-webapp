COLUMBIA, S. C., January 28, 1865.

Respectfully referred to Adjutant and Inspector General and attention asked to report on Subsistence Department.

The ration to prisoners is very small and insufficient. Great inconvenience is felt from not having an assistant commissary of subsistence to the prisons. I find that where we have to depend upon the staff officers of the posts we can get nothing but what is forced out of them.

JNO H. WINDER,

Brigadier - General.

Respectfully referred to Adjutant and Inspector General.

It is quite probable that the assignment of commissary may be the means of bettering the condition of the prisoners at Florence, S. C.

R. H. CHILTON,

Assistant Adjutant and Inspector General.

SUBSISTENCE BUREAU, February 4, 1865.

Respectfully returned to Adjutant and Inspector General.

Unless more money is furnished the bureau it will be impossible to continue to issue the present ration to prisoners of war, much less to increase it.

L. B. NORTHROP,

Commissary - General.
