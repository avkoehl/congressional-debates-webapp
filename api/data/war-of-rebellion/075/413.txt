HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,Near Allatoona Creek, June 5, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding Army of the Ohio:

GENERAL: General McPherson finds no enemy to his front and has pushed his skirmishers half a mile beyond New Hope Church, capturing 1 lieutenant and 30 men. Your flank now becomes the point of interest. The order of yesterday will be executed. McPherson will move by a road to the rear of Thomas to a point in front of Acworth. Thomas will cross Allatoona Creek by the bridge near McCook's present headquarters and move out toward Andersonville, connecting with McPherson by pickets, and you can follow him. I judge your line facing southeast will rest near the bridge you cross, and your center at the blacksmith shop on the main road from Allatoona to Marietta, the same that is laid down on our maps as passing through Golgotha and Lost Mountain Post-Office.

We can adjust our lines after reaching the ground. I prefer our lines not to be deployed too much, but held in masses at central points with connections from army to army made by skirmish lines. We being on the offensive should be prepared to move quick. When we reach our next position I will await Blair's arrival, replenish stores, make and fortify our depot at Allatoona, and then move on according to the point where Johnston selects for battle. I think he will oppose us lightly
