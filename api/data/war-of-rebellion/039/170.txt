Numbers 3. Report of Major General Joseph Hooker, U. S. Army, commanding Army fo the Potomac, with congratulatory orders.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,May 3, 1863-3.30 p. m.

(Received 4 p. m.)

We have had a desperate fight yesterday and to-day, which has resulted in no success to us, having lost a position of two lines which had been selected for our defense. It is now 1.30 o'clock, and there is still some firing of artillery. We may have another turn at this p. m. I do not despair of success. If Sedgwick could have gotten up, there could have been but one result. As it is impossible for me to know the exact position of Sedgwick as regards his ability to advance and take part in the engagement, I cannot tell when it will end. We will endeavor to do our best. My troops are in good spirits. We have fought desperately to-day. No general ever commanded a more devoted army.

JOSEPH HOOKER,

Major-General.

His Excellency A. LINCOLN,

President of the United States.
