General HECKMAN,

Getty's Station:

GENERAL: Have duncan's brigade ready to embark at Portsmouth at 7 o'clock to-morrow morning without fail, with two days' cooked rations and 70 rounds ammunition. The proper officers at Norfolk will answer your requisition in this behalf. Telegraph me at Fortress Monroe any difficulties in the way of the execution, and will smooth the difficulties, but there must be no impossibility.

CIRCULAR.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,

March 9, 1864.

In view of the near approach of the time when this army may be expected to resume active operations, the commanding general considers that the interest of the service require that the ladies now with the army, other than those here under the special authority of the War department or these headquarters, as members of the Sanitary Commission or other charitable associations, should not longer remain with it. The commanding general therefore desires that the corps commanders cause the officers of their respective commands to be notified that it is expected they will make the necessary arrangements to sent beyond the lines of the army, with as little delay as practicable, the ladies at present visiting them.

The authority heretofore given the provost-marshal-general to grant permits to ladies to visit the army upon the recommendation of corps commanders is revoked.

By command of Major-General Meade:
