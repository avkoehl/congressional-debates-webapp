THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 25,
who has since been appointed paymaster ip the
Army assisted him. I ask the attention of the
Senate for a moment to the testimony of Judge
Wootten, residing in the county in which I live.
On page 81 of the report he swears that there was
great intimidation of Democrats by the presence
of the mihtaryatthe pollsnpon thatday,and that
some dozen Democrats were run off the ground;
and other witnesses show that for two or three
days they remained hid m a swamp to prevent
themselves from being arrested by this armed sol-
dieiy sejil into the Stale for the purpose of •* pre-
serving the put ity of elections," and "allowing
true Union men to vote!" On page 90, Judge
Wootten stales this vei v important fact, that dur-
ing the silting of the court in Newcastle a con-
versation took place on this subject, and one reason
being assigned—
" 1 remarkod that that could not have been the cause, for
I heard a respcciahk: enileman hay, after the election, that
the commit-ioiw of two prov<>>t inai dial 5 weie iceeived on
Friday pieviou^ tothe election. Mr. George P. Fisher said
that tiiat w.is rot <0, that lie knew that they werenotmade
out until Muuht) ; ih.it in- helped to fill them up."
Mr. Fisher, the Republican candidate for Con-
giess, as pioved by the sworn testimony of Judge
Woollen, said the appointments ofpiovost mar-
shals in the State of Dcliware were never made
out until the Sunday before our election on Tues-
day, for he, the Republican candidate for Con-
gress, had helped to fill them up on that day. Sir,
let the country know that you have at the head
of the War Department a man who does not fill
up the commissions which he sends out by him-
self or by any person connected with his Depart-
ment, lmt that upon the eve of an election in a
State he sends his blank commissions to paiti-
eans, and tho^n paitn.ans candidates for office,
and allows them to (ill up the commissions with
such names as f hey please Talk not to me about
a desire to pn set ve ihe Constitution ami to main-
tain the Union and the purity of< lections, when
1 find it pi oved by the sworn testimony of honoi -
able men that he who is charged with the admin-
istration of your War Department is guilty of
such acts as these. Sir, it is pai tisanship, and
pai tranship of the basest, deepest dye. Pan mt-
ism is no (lenient m any .such conduct, and a
patriotic man would acorn to bcguilly of it.
I wish now to call allention to another fact, for
I want to bum; this matter home to the Seeictary
of War. I nnsmueii as n casual leader of the ie~
spoil so which (iie Seci elai y has made to the Sen-
ate might runic hide (hat he was as innocent of t he
whole transaction as a eh: id unborn, 1 wish to In m 
it home to his door; and I call .it(enlion now to the
testimony of Daniel .1. Lay ton, a Rr publican who
came on as fai us Dalumoie at least, and went
down on hoaid the Mcaaibo.it when- the tioop.s
weie sent, to see how this thin;1* came to be done.
He swears to having had interviews with Colo-
nel McCoombs, All. Fisher, Air. Lofljnd,and
others, m reference to this matter; and then his
testimony goes on:

Now,.sir, sc.1 how these, commissions for pto-
vost ma'-sbiUs came to be sent to Delaware in
blank. On the j\iday befose the election, Col-
onel McCoombs come- to Washington to get sol-
diers sent into the S.v.te, .mu he has an mtemew
with the >S. ti-Uay of War, and the just infer-
ence is that ho if tut.:. (! liom-i wiiii ins pockets
filled with blael. eohiniir-MfMKs; and the caiuhdate
for Reps«. M'lUatu o i i t Joi.'.,rress, and the gen tic man
who w.is to he SVen tat) of State and who was
Sectvt.u y of Sl.-fe und"r Mr. Cannon, ami this
Mr. Loflaud were niMted to meet hnn in the city
of Wilmington on Sunday, and the.-,e commis-
sions, as Mr. George P. Fisher says, weie filled
up on Sunday because he helped to do it.
But, sir, what was the object of sending them
there? It leaks out. On pages 191 and 197 is to
be found very important testimony showing at
whose instance and for what reasons the troops
were sent into the State of Delaware. Mr. Minos
Conway, at page 191, testifies:
" Question. Do you know at who^e solicitation those
soldiers weie brought there and placed at the polls?
'• ^Jnsu-cr. Iheaid Nathaniel Oomvay say that ho and
soveial other gentlemen, namely, William Rllegood, Jacob
Mooie, Jtidye Layton, and Jetc-o P. Coiuvav, signed a pe-
tition to have ihem biought into the State ol Di-iawai c.
'• Question, Do you know to whom they petitioned?
" .flnnver- I do not.
" Question. Do you know when it was they signed the
petition ?
Jlnsiccr. He loid me they signed the petition the day
after the little election."
That was four weeks before our general elec-
tion. It was the election for election officers,
usually called the little election, in which the
Democrats swept the State and showed thatthere
was no possibility even for " ^reenbacks>'to car-
ry the State, and that the only tiling that could
do it was an ovcrpoweiin«' militaty force.
" Question. Did you umUnstand iwr what purpose they
petttioued foi soldier-! to he bion^ht into the Stale, and to
be heie on the d,iv of tin* ueneul election ?
u .dusiici, J undefined it w.i-^ to cany the election for
the Republican party.
u Question. Did \ou hear Nathaniel Conway cxpK^.s
hitnseif in ie«ani to the soldier-^, and tor what puipo.-c
tliey weie to he hrou^ht3
*dw>n'er. I\Ii. t^mway told nie, 'They ate to keep the
Dcinoc! at^ at a di.-lanCe.'
'• Question. Did the pre-ence ol the soldiers at the poll-.
o:i that day produce much intimidation ?
" vlnsut')'. I bhould think ltdid."
Inasmuch as the names of private citizens ne-
cessarily have appealed in lilts evidence, 1 wish
to say that I bfin^ them in not with any view of
saying anything unkind towaid any gentleman
ot my State, howevei much i may differ fiom
him, however much I may condemn his political
piuieiplcs and hi-; political actum. 1 do ji fiom
no motive of pi isonul unknulnc.ss, hut simplyas
this ipicstion is hefote the S(mate and the country
to show that thoie isjust cause of complaint.
It is the ieslimony of neaily all the witnesses
who weie examined that it did produce intimida-
tion, and 1 shall not trouble t he Senate with read-
ing the testimony of witnesses to piove that fact,
because 11eai Iy i very witness sweats to it. Hut
the nunc nnpoitant part of Mr. Conway's testi-
mony will lv found on page 197:

The eonvei'-atlou then ended.^
I will here remaik that Judge Layton is one of
the most prominent Republicans m our State.
C'eitainiy, \vhate\er lie may have done in life, lie
never voted a Dcmociatic ticket, and never will.
Mr. President, I ha\e shown you by the testi-
mony of themayorof Wilmington, who was sup-
potted for thatoilice by ihe Union paityso called,
and who voted the Union ticket at the same elec-
tion, that the candidate for Congress on the Re-
publican ticket, a contractor under the General
Government, and a subsequcntappomtec to office
undi r the General Government, all Republicans.
1J on the Sabbath day met m the city of Wilming- ,
i| ton to consult the mayor as to what force he would I
jl like to have in that city. The mayor was at: honest I
mm, and lie said, "None; there is no need for I
j military here;" and yet despite his icmonstiance ;
ji they weie stationed at e\ cry poll in the city of Wil- !
i| nungton; ami, according to the sworn testimony j
ij of the mayor, their presence thoie cieatcd disor- i
ii der, and disorder which would not have existed I
if they had not been there. I have shown you
that this same Colonel McCoombs applied to the
Secretary of War on the Friday immediately pre-
vious to our election, and that he was met at his
own house on the following Sunday by Mr.
Fisher and the other gentlemen to whom 1 have
alluded; and I have shown you that Mr. Fisher
himself helped to fill the blank commissions. I
have shown you by the sworn testimony of un-
impeached witnesses that prominent Republicans
were heard to say that, having been beaten by the
Democrats at the little election, it was necessary,
in order lo carry the genu al election, to have force,
not force to preserve the right of the voter, not
force to secure a fair election.because every wit-
ness who testifies states that the little election only
four weeks before had been, to an unprecedented
degree, a peaceable and quiet one, but force to
beat the Democrats. And yet men have the ef-
frontery, ay, sir, the audacity, when we com-
plain against these outrages, either to deny them
or to justify them. Sii, some men would justify
the war of Lucifer against the Almighty God who
hurled him to the bottomless pit, if thereby they
could profit.
Now, Mr. President, I wish to show you while I
am on that branch of the subject that the signature
of Mr. Stanton was attached to these commis-
sions. On page 93 will be found the testimony
of John C. Hazzaid, a provost marshal, a Repub-
lican. There was not a Democrat in all the State
of Delaware fit to be intrusted with a provost
maishalship on that day. I will read a portion
of his testimony:
a Question. Were jou piovost marshal on the day of the
la^t general election ?
'•sinsircr. Ye<, •-nr.
"Question. Fiom whom did you receive your commis-
sion :if> piovoj-t niai^hai?
>-v2;iwn\ LMwui M. Stanton, Seeictary of War."
"Question. By whom was this commission delivered to
> on ?
"*'ln*ucr. Hy John 1). Rodney."
A Republican.
I (i Question. On what day?
I ".//uitrec. On tin'2d day of November.
| 11 Question. W.u the vM of November the Sabbath day?
"jinsu c). I believe it wa-." * * -t a *
j fc< Question. Did vou believe then, or do you believe now,
I that theie was greatei necessity lor the mihtaiy to preserve
i oulei at the p'dU than bail exi-tcd at pievious etcci ion--J
I 'vJnsiccr. I cannot s;iv that I do oi did. I \vill add that
the -oldies or mihtaiy weie not their; by request oi .solicit-
ation ot nunc made to ,uiv p< r^on."
Ho was ashamed of it after the thing was over
that he had been engaged in the dirty work.
I will now read fiom the testimony of Rhodes
ILt/.zaidjOn page 17, another one of these beau-
tiful specimens of provost marshals, who it is
proved here drove the voters away from the polls
and would not allow them to vote:
"Quettion. When did you receive your commission as
piovo-t m.ushal5
'•v7?iw/cr. On Hundaj evening."
j On Sunday a special tram Hew up to Wilming-
j ton, the commissions weie filled up, and then the
I ti am ilew back again and messengers were sent
i out and were engaged all Sunday night in riding
j about to deliver .Secretary Stanton's commissions
j to persons that he never heard of or knew any-
i thing about, but men whose names were inserted
| in the blank commissions by George P. Fisher,
J Republican candidate for Congress, and James
1 R. Lollami, now a paymaster in the Army; and
, yet yon would believe trom the Secretary's com-
1 muincations to the Senate that he was a most
wondeiful mihtaiy man, and would soon put
; down this rebellion by bending in< n into the field
1 toJiiihtan open enemy in the field. Mr. Haz-
: zaid s iys his commission wa« from the War De-
: pas tau nt, and signed by F. AL Stanton.
! Here is the testimony of Garrett S. Layton,
; another provost marshal, on page 18:
J 6i Question. When did you leeeive y onr coinmh'uon ?

A number of witnesses swore that the commis-
sions were filled up some by George P. Fisln r
and some by James R. Lofland. S. W. Lacey,
on page 16t5, testifies:
Question. By whom weie j nu a|)pomted ?
