ABBEVILLE, November 27, 1862.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General:

The enemy is advancing in force; crossed a considerable force from Helena; is also moving down the river in boats. I am told General Holmes objects to sending 10,000 men ordered to Vicksburg; it is essential to its safety. I hope the order will be reiterated at once. I have no doubt we shall soon be attacked by greatly superior force. A strong demonstration also against Port Hudson.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Lieutenant-General, Commanding.

Lieutenant-General PEMBERTON:

Enemy advancing in three columns of 10,000 each on State Line, Pigeon Roost, and Hernando roads; had not reached Coldwater at latest advices from our pickets. Large number of troops reported on this side the Mississippi River, but no advance this way indicated yet. I have 60 pickets in that direction and a scouting party toward Helena. This command guarding approaches north of Tallahatchie. Obstructions and fortifications here progressing rapidly.
