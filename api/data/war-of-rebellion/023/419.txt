out where they are and have them watched, but do not seize them until they are needed. Do this secretly, but be sure you find out all the private stock. I suppose you have already done it, but you have not reported. I want to know how many rations we can rely upon from this source.

HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 25, 1862.

Colonel MILLER, Nashville:

Direct Colonel Pennebaker to intrench himself at once with rifle pits and otherwise and send him tools for the purpose. This should be done instantly and the intrechments thrown up by morning. I will then not be necessary to re-enforce him.

Chief of Staff.

NASHVILLE, TENN., August 25, 1862.

Colonel HAMBRIGHT, Gallatin:

If you are alone, without the Ninth Indiana, you had better make forced march to Drake's Creek, 5 miles north of Manscoe Creek, and re-enforce the garrison at Drake's Creek, and then join our troops at Manscoe Creek. If the Ninth Indiana and artillery are with you you can defy the enemy, but as Gallatin is of no consequence, you may march on down to Drake's Creek Bridge and re-enforce the garrison, and then join our troops at Manscoe Creek with your main force.

General ROUSSEAU, Huntsville:

No fight. Bragg is very slow. If he wants one he can have it. We are all ready.

HEADQUARTERS,Decherd, August 25, 1862.

General ROUSSEAU, Huntsville

We will hold Huntsville and line to Stevenson. Direct the troops now there to remain and take post one regiment in and near stockade at depot and the battery and some infantry on the hill; the cavalry near the town. The Tenth Wisconsin will be sent back. Send one of your trains at once to Pulaski and bring the supplies from that post and Athens to Huntsville, then take your two trains and go to Nashville as ordered. More force will subsequently be sent to Huntsville. The force left there must hold it for the present. Getting rations down from Pulaski may detain you a day.

JAMES B. FRY.
