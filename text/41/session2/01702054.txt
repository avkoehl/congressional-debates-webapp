from Nevada asks unanimous consent to take
up the bill (H. 11. No. 866) to confirm the

There being no objection the Senate, as in

the bill. Itprovides that the apportionment of
members of the Legislative Assemblies of the
Territory of Arizona, elected and convened in
the years 18GG, 1867, and 1888, made by the

and if such census is not completed in time, then
the apportionment shall be made according to

places whenever, in his judgment, the public

versy where the title or boundaries of land may
be in dispute, or where the debtor sum claimed

The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read

SESATOIv FROM MISSISSIPPI.
Mr. MORTON. As the Committee on the
Judiciary have reported against the credentials
of General Ames, I suppose they will not feel
it their duty or province to call up that report
for consideration. I ask, then, if they have
any objection to having the consideration of
those credentials made the special order for
to-morrow at one o'clock?
Mr. ANTHONY. Say Monday.
Mr. CONKLING. As 1 was charged by
the committee to report on those credentials,
I beg to say to the honorable Senator from
Indiana that I shall endeavor not to fall short
of my duty in a respect so manifest as that
which he indicates. I think it would be very
extraordinary if the committee did not call up
the credentials for consideration, and I should
deem it very extraordinary if I did not myself
see that thev were taken up.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Does the Sen-
ator from Indiana press his motion ?
Mr. MORTON. No, sir. I will merely make
this remark in explanation: that my under-
standing is where a committee reports ad-
versely on a bill or proposition they do not
expect to call up that adverse report for a favor-
able consideration. Therefore, I felt at liberty
to suggest the propriety of making the matter
a special order for to-morrow at one o'clock;
but as the Senator from New York says he is
disposed to call it up of course I do not wish
to interfere.
Mr. CONKLING. The honorable Senator
from Indiana entirely overlooks the fact that
this is not only a question of privilege, but
of very high privilege. No special order is
needed. At any time a Senator having the
floor may call it up, and it overrides special
orders and everything else.
The VICE PRESIDENT. When the Senate
is not engaged in tlio transaction of other
business.
Mr. CONKLING. Of course.
ADJOURNMENT TO MONDAY
Mr. SPENCER. I move that when the
Senate adjourns to-day it be to meet on Mon-
day next.
The motion was agreed toâ€”ayes thirty-two,
noes not counted.

francis s. m'donald.
Mr. RICE. I ask the Senate to proceed to
the consideration of House joint resolution
No. 53.
The motion was agreed to, by unanimous con-
sent; and the Senate, as in Committee of the
Whole, proceeded to consider the joint resolu-
tion (II. R. No. 53) for the relief of Francis S.

mail contracts.
Mr. CORBETT. I offer the following res-
olution, and ask lor its present consideration :
Resolved, Tliat tho Committee on Post Offices and
Post Roads bo, and they aro hereby, instructed to
inquire into t he expediency of enactinga law requir-
ing that every bidder upon every mail route for tho
transportation of mails upon the same shall hereafter

There being no objection, the Senate pro-
ceeded to consider the resolution.
Mr. CORBETT. I simply wish to present
I wish to submit a few
this resolution, as the matter is coming before
the Committee on Post Offices and Post Roads
to-morrow morning. The purpose of the res-
olution is to prevent" straw bids," as they are
commonly called ; that parties shall not bid

The resolution was adopted.
order OF business.
Mr. SUMNER. I ask the Senate to pro-
ceed to the consideration of Senate bill No.
492. It concerns the interests of the District
of Columbia, and should have been considered
some time ago.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Massachusetts asks unanimous consent to con-
sider the bill (S. No. 492) to incorporate the
trustees of the Corcoran Gallery of Art, and
for other purposes.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I think we had better go
on with the regular order. There are several
poor widows waiting for pensions whose cases
we shall never reach if we occupy time in
taking up measures out of their regular order.
Mr. SUMNER. Do I understand that tho
Senator objects to the bill?
Mr. EDMUNDS. I do not object to the
bill, but I object to taking it up out of its
order.
joint indian committee.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The business in
order is the consideration of resolutions laid
over; and the first resolution is the concur-
rent resolution proposing a joint committee on
Indian policy, the pending question being on
the amendmeut of the Senator from Vermont,
[Mr. Edmunds,] to strike out the words "such
other subjects pertaining to Indian affairs as
may be referred to it by either branch of Con-
gress" and to insert "system of government
of Indian tribes."
Mr. THURMAN.
remarks.
Mr. EDMUNDS. I ask my friend to let us
vote on this amendment, which will certainly
improve the resolution. It reduces the force
of the resolution.
Mr. THURMAN. "Anything that will make
it "small by degrees and beautifully less"
will suit me: but I shall object to it even then.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. THURMAN. Mr. President 
The VICE PRESIDENT. The morning
hour has expired, and the Georgia bill is before
the Senate.
Mr. THURMAN. I was going to ask that
this resolution bo put at the foot of the Cal-
endar.
The VICE PRESIDENT. If there be no
objection, the resolution will be placed at the
foot of the Calendar.
Mr. HARLAN. I think it had better main-
tain its present position.
Mr. STEWART. I want a division on the
question of agreeing to the amendment of the
Senator from Vermont.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The Senator from lowain
charge of the resolution agrees to the amend-
ment, and is satisfied with it.
Mr. HARLAN. I expressed my willingness
to have the amendment adopted.
Mr. STEWART. Very well.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Senator from
Ohio moves that the concurrent resolution be
placed at the foot of the Calendar. If there
is no objection the Chairwill submit that ques-
tion to the Senate, as it is a question to be
decided without debate.
Mr. STEWART. I object.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Objection being
made, the question cannot be taken. The reso-
lution is cut off by the expiration of the morn-
ing hour.
