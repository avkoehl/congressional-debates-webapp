CLERK'S OFFICE OF COURT OF APPEALS,

Frankfort, Ky., April 24, 1861.

Honorable GREEN ADAMS:

DEAR SIR: First. See my letter yesterday. The Governor got no money at Louisville, and will get none. The banks told him they would lead the State money if applied for by the Legislature for purposes of defense. Second. Now, we must prevent all border excitement. This is being done very well at Cincinnati, &amp;c. See proceedings inclosed.* Hanson is second in command of the Kentucky State Guard, and we urged him to visit Covington, &c., to see for himself and talk with our friends. Third. The Governor is sending cannon, &c., tp Paducah, and if he can get up a row he will do it. I hope General Scott will issue most pacific and stringent orders to the troops at and near Cairo. You know that is the worst portion of our State for locofocoism. I hear the Union feeling is stronger than it was last summer. I carried the district by 800 majority against 1,000 on the other side a year previous for Burnet.

Yours, truly,

LESLIE COOMBS.

COMMANDING OFFICER ILLINOIS VOLUNTEERS,

At or near Cairo, Ill.:

SIR: It is deemed inexpedient, because irritating to Kentucky and other States bordering on the Ohio, to detain cargoes of provisions descending the rivers from those States. That this may not be used as a means for extending the spirit of secession, Lieutenant-General Scott, with the concurrence of the War Department, directs that you put a stop to such detention by the troops under your command until further orders.

I am, &c.,

E. D. TOWNSEND.
