Brigadier General JOSEPH F. KNIPE,

Commanding Cavalry Division:

GENERAL: I herewith send You an order for the embarkation of Your command for Fort Gaines. The general commanding directs me to say that two steamers, the Calhoun and Corinthian, each with capacity for about ninety horses, will be at Chalmette to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock. You will hold Your command in readiness to load the vessels as they are furnished, without unnecessary delay. The general further directs that You embark Colonel Johnson's brigade first, in order to give Colonel Karge as much time as possible to concentrate and refit his command. Captain Perkins, assistant quartermaster, at the foot of Common street, is master of transportation and reports that he will be able to take from 200 to 500 horses daily. The ten days' rations and forage should, as far as possible, be sent upon the vessels with the troops. Use all possible dispatch in sending the regiments which are ordered up the river to their destination.

Very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

S. L. WOODWARD,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
