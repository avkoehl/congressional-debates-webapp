petitions and memorials.
Mr. CASSERLY. I present the petition of
Nievas Aguilar de Serrano, of California, on
behalf of herself and the other heirs of her late
father, Rosario Aguilar, deceased. The peti-
tion alleges, with great detail, that at the time
of his death her father was seized by valid title
of a tract of land of one square league in the
State of California, and after his death, in con-
sequence of the ignorance of law on the part
of herself and theother heirs, requiringthem to
present a claim within a certain period of time,
they lost the right to have it passed upon by
the courts. She asks for a remedy by the pas-
sage of a bill granting them an equivalent
quantity of land elsewhere within the southern
district of California. I move the reference of
the petition to the Committee on Private Land
Claims.
'The motion was agreed to.

Mr. BUCKINGHAM. I present the remon-
strance of Mrs. E. T. Fitch and one hundred
and fifty-two Â®tber women of Connecticut,
mostly residents of the city of New Haven,
against female suffrage. During the rebellion
1 had occasion to make the acquaintance of
many of those whose names are signed to this
remonstrance, and I do not hesitate to say that
there are no women in New England who
were more devoted to all those interests which
tended to make the volunteers efficient and
tended to promote their comfort than those
whose names are signed here. They are intel-
ligent; they are patriotic; they are earnestly
anxious for the preservation of the Union and
the happiness of the people. They are true
to their nature. They are women, not manly
women, but womanly women, who are ready
to bear the burdens and responsibilities which
pertain to their nature; but they protest against
any action of Congress which will place upon
them burdens which belong to the stronger
sex or which would introduce into the family
circle any element of discord. I move the ref-
erence of this memorial to the Committee on
the Judiciary.
The motion was agreed to.
Mr. PATTERSON presented a memorial
of citizens of Anacostia village, Washington

Anderson comity, Texas, praying the removal

ferred to the select Committee on the Removal
of Political Disabilities.
Mr. VICKERS. I offer the petition of
William Wann and forty-three others, surviv-
ing soldiers and the widows of surviving soldiers
ofthe war of 1812, asking for pensions. The
ages of these petitioners vary from sixty-nine
to ninety years, and if any relief is to be ex-
tended to them it must come quickly, for time
is doing its work with that class of our people.
The VICE PRESIDENT. The Committee
on Pensions having reported on that subject,

petition will be laid upon the table.
