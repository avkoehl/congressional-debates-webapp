DECATUR [July 9, 1862.]

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I have the honor to inform you that I have succeeded in safely landing the engine Sam. Cruse on this shore of the river. When I arrived here yesterday about 1 p.m. the boat that was to convey the engine was but partially framed. Since then we have completed the boat, launched it, and she has made a successful trip with her valuable cargo.

A. D. STREIGHT,

Colonel.

DECATUR, July 9, 1862.

Colonel J. B. FRY:

I have just been informed that the telegraph line has been torn down and a water tank burned 15 miles from this point. This was done by regular Confederate troops. There were 65 engaged in doing this work, so the citizens told me who gave me the information. I shall take 50 men and repair the damage? The train has not arrived.

W. H. WADE,

Captain, Commanding Post.

DECATUR, July 9, 1862.

Major-General BUELL:

SIR: The train has not arrived and I do not know why it is detained. The enemy did not make his appearance last night,but I am satisfied that he has a regiment at or near Danville. This force may have taken the train between here and Tuscumbia. The water tank at Courtland was burned yesterday. I will send a messenger to Courtland.

W. H. WADE,

Captain, Thirty-first Ohio Volunteers.
HDQRS. FIRST DIVISION, DISTRICT OF THE OHIO, Tuscumbia, July 9, 1862.

Major-General HALLECK, Corinth:

Have heard nothing from the East to-day and therefore presume everything is all quiet.

There are no signs of the enemy's scouts near Frankfort or Russellville. A negro boy came in to-day, from Columbs last Friday. He says they are fortifying and not over 6,000 strong, and have a good many sick. He heard some talk of troops going to Richmond, but saw none leave Columbs. Saw no pickets after getting 2 miles this side of Columbus.

GEO. H. THOMAS,Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
