skill of my subordinate officers, and I mention again that to Colonels Bell, Lyon, and Rucker, commanding brigades, I feel mainly indebted for this crowning success over vastly superior numbers.

It would be unjust to close my report without referring to the gallant and meritorious conduct of my escort company, commanded by Captain J. C. Jackson. Owing to drill, discipline, and material it services were to me on this occasion, as on many other fields, invaluable, and I consider it to-day the best body of men in my command-dashing, daring, and unflinching in the execution of orders given, and as scouts, for reliability and effectiveness, they are without an equal.

In conclusion, my acknowledgments are also due to Major Charles W. Anderson, acting assistant adjutant-general, and to Lieutenant Donelson and Galloway, my aides-de-camp. Fully alive to the emergencies of the occasion and the odds against us, they were prompt and faithful in the execution of all orders and untiring in the discharge of every duty devolving upon them from the commencement of the battle until pursuit was ended.

Respectfully submitted.

N. B. FORREST,

Major-General.
