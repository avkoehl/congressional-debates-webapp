I do not care to enlarge upon our privations or trumpet the gallantry of the brave men under my command who have so cheerfully endured them. The same task would be as cheerfully undertaken again, but inn view of these facts, general, I most respectfully, but most persistently and urgently, ask leave to withdraw my troops to Chattanooga while there is a chance that I can possibly do so.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. GRANGER,

Major-General, Commanding Fourth Army Corps,

TAZEWELL, December 8, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE:

Knoxville.:

MY DEAR GENERAL: I received your request through Colonel Foster to move down and join you. I shall do so as soon as the provision wagons that have left the gap arrive so that we can escort them. I believe Longstreet to be in full retreat, the rear of his infantry about opposite here. The rear guard of his cavalry is between Blain's Cross-Roads and Rutledge.

Colonel Foster with the cavalry has moved to join your cavalry.

I hope to see you soon.

With best regards, yours, most truly,

J. G. FOSTER,

Major-General.

TAZEWELL, December 8, 1863.

Major-General BURNSIDE,

Knoxville:

I received your dispatches sent by courier this p.m. at 4 o'clock and have forwarded them by telegraph. The main body of Longstreet's infantry is now near Bean's Station. It will be necessary for the infantry force to remain here one day longer to prevent interruption into this part of the State from which we are now drawing forage and subsistence.

I will see you soon.

JNumbers G. FOSTER,

Major-General.

MUNFORDVILLE, KY.,

December 8, 1863

Captain SEMPLE,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Louisville, Ky.:

Sent three cavalry detachments from Columbia across the Cumberland. One from Glasgow to Cumberland captured one of Ferguson's thieves. Troops are now in Tennessee and have instructions to break up rebel bands in border counties.

E. H. HOBSON,

Brigadier-General.
