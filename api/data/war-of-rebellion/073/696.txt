ing set in. Both of these operations were performed by Surg. E. Shippen, U. S. Volunteers, medical director Twenty-third Army Corps, and both were unfavorable cases. The third was an amputation of upper third of thigh by Doctor Rodgers; the patient never reacted. Surg. J. F. Kimbley, Eleventh Kentucky, in addition to his supervision of the brigade depots, assisted at the operating table as occasion required, and rendered valuable service in both positions. The wounded under his supervision have been uniformly as well cared for at the depots as circumstances required. Asst. Surg. S. E. Sheldon, One hundred and fourth Ohio Volunteer Infantry, has also rendered valuable services as an assistant at the operating board and in procuring medical supplies. Asst. Surg. G. W. Jones, Sixty-third Indiana, has had charge of the records of the division, and a more faithful, prompt, and efficient assistant I could not hope to find. And in closing this part of my report I beg leave to state that the medical staff of this division, with very few exceptions, have been active, industrious, and energetic, and in no instance have they failed to heartily co-operate with me in carrying out any measure that had for its object the good of the troops serving in the division.
