STEWART VAN VLIET,

Brevet Brigadier-General and Quartermaster.

No. 105. WASHINGTON, D. C., July 27, 1865.

Bvt. Major General M. C. MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General U. S. Army, Washington, D. C.:

GENERAL: At your request I furnish you with the following data, obtained in my recent trip from Santa, Fe, N. Mex., to Fort Leavenworth, Kans.:

There are two old and well-established routes from Fort Union (the main depot of supplies for the troops in New Mexico) to Fort Leavenworth, viz, the Raton and the Cimarron routes. The former passes over the Raton Mountain, crossing the Purgatory and Timpas Rivers and the Arkansas River at Bent's Old Fort; then down that stream, passing Fort Lyon, Colo. Ter., forty miles below; thence ninety miles to Choteau's Island, where it unites with a branch of the Cimarron route, called Aubrey's Cut-off; thence down the river eighty miles to where the Cimarron route crosses the Arkansas River. The two routes unite at this point, known as the Cimarron Crossing, and form one route to Fort Leavenworth. The grass on the miles farther than by the Cimaron, and the road is much worse. Fort Lyon, on the Raton route, is a collection of stone buildings erected in 1860-"61 by six companies of the then First U. S. Cavalry, under the late General Sedgwick, then lieutenant-colonel of that regiment. Nothing of any consequence has been done to the buildings since he left them. They are incomplete, but habitable, and are, or were as I passed, occupied, I believe, by three small companies of Colorado Volunteers. The animals, both horses and mules, of this command were not in very good order, which was attributed to the want of grain, of which they had been without entirely for several months until a few days before I passed, when a large supply was received from Fort Leavenworth. The grain for this post should come from the settlements on the Arkansas River, which commence some sixty-five miles above the post, and from those on the Huerfano and Purgatory Rivers, tributaries of the Arkansas from the south,
