The resolution offered yesterday by Mr. YoüivG,
calling for information from the Secietary of the
Treasury, was taken up for consideiation
Mr. YOUNG stated that this resolution was
similar to one which had been ofFeied at the last
session, and to which he was not aware there had
been any answer íecei ved He had been informed,
however, that mfoimation had already been col-
lected, and would shortly be piesented to the Sen-
ate, which would render unnecessary a part of
the resolution, and he therefore pioposed to sub-
titute for it the following
Resolved, That the Secretary of the Preasury be required j
to report to the Senate, in addition to tin information called '
for by the resolution of Februarj lo, 1838, in relation to
public defaulters all defalcations which have since oc

wout, latecollecturof the port of New York,) and the names
of the securities m each case the suspended and rejected

HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES
Wednesday, January 2, 1839
Mr ADAMS moved that the Journal be cor-
rected, so as to enter theieon the icquest made
by him on Monday, to take up and consider his
resolutions calhngupon the Piesidentof the Uni-
ted States for certain information m lelation to
the contioveisv between our Minister to England
and Daniel O'Conneh, and also that he sent to the
clerk's table, to be read, alettei, threatening him
with assassination, and that the said motion was
rejected
Mr LEWIS, in lefeience to that letter, said he
was satisfied it was a quiz, and was purely ficti-
tious, for no individual of that name was known
in Alabama
Mr ROBERTSON bore testimony to the same
fact.
Mr ADAMS respected the motives of the gen-
tleman ftom Alabama in vindicating the people of
his State, but Mi A could not consider a thieat
of assassination, whether true or false, as a quiz,
unless tieason be a quiz, oi muider be a quiz, or
forgery be a quiz
Mi   A   was here called to order
The motion of Mr Ad ims was lejeeted—ayLS

the Treasury
Objection being made,

ing the House that he would not occupy two min-
utes The rules were suspended—ayes 114, noes
38
Mr CUSHMAN expressed his acknowledg-
ments to the House, and said he would not tres-
pass upon its patience so long as it had taken to
decide the question All he wished to say was
this that on Monday a resolution was offeied by
a gentleman from Virginia, [Mr Wise,] propos-
ing to laise a select committee to investigate the
conduct of the Secretary of the Treasury, and to
inquire whether they can find sufficient evidence
upon which to found articles of impeachment
against him, and this committee was proposed to
be chosen by ballot Mi C at the time objected
to the then consideration of the resolution, not
because he was opposed to investigation—far from
it, and he knew at the time the Secretary of the
Treasury would solicit an investigation whenever
the House desired to have it, and he would say
now that, if the gentleman would so modify his
resolution that the committee should be raided
forthwith m the usual way, Mi C would with-
diaw his pioposition He wasfuitherauthorized
to say, that so anxious and so desuous was that
distinguished officei of the Government to have
an investigation into the whole of his official eon
duct, that Ml C would now say that he would
not mteipose an objection to íaistne; the commit
