to Wilmington? If so, send the order. I did not so understand it, nor can I conceive of the necessity. Whiting has not so communicated to me. It left Weldon on the 12th, the day mentioned in your telegram, the train having broken down en route for Weldon from this city. To make assurance doubly sure, I send a staff officer to General Whiting by to-night's train. I suppose I will by this means get a certified reply.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,January 15, 1864.

Major General J. A. Early, with his staff, will proceed to Staunton and resume his command of the Valley District. The post quartermaster will furnish transportation.

By order of General Lee:

C. S. VENABLE,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

PETERSBURG, January 15, 1864.

General S. COOPER:

The following telegrams have been received from General Whiting:

WILMINGTON, January 14, 1864.

Major-General PICKETT;

The emergency is, I want troops; must have been. If you send Kemper I will see that you get others. Telegraph the War Department what I want. If they agree to the movement you must get troops from Virginia. I will write you to-morrow. Cipher goes straight from beginning. Would rather you would keep Kemper where he is and send me Clingman, if possible.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

This was sent in cipher:

WILMINGTON, January 15, 1864.

General PICKETT;

Dispatch received. Have not yet called on Terry. Let War Department know my wishes and see what they say. Wrote you this morning.

W. H. C. WHITING,

Major-General.

Shall I send Clingman and keep Kemper at Goldsborough, as Whiting asks? If so, I will want some other troops here. Kemper's brigade is ready to move when Whiting calls for it. One of Clingman's regiments is on Blackwater. I must have a force there, as I am threatened with a raid from direction of Suffolk.

G. E. PICKETT,

Major-General.
