HEADQUARTERS SECOND CAVALRY DIVISION,August 19, 1864.

Colonel MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, Second Army Corps:

COLONEL: All quiet this morning. The enemy still holds the intersection of the New Market and Charles City roads. My pickets connect from Deep Run to Malvern Hill, running down the Charles city road to the Second Creek, thence by a road west and near the road to Wills' Church, and down the Quaker road to the Hill. In the affair of yesterday evening the dismounted cavalry held successfully the works at the intersection of the New Market and Charles City roads against the attack in front, and quit them only when the enemy had passed by the right and left to their rear. Last night the enemy fell back in rear of this line of works.

Very respectfully,

D. McM. GREGG,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding Second Division.
