than they can carry. During the summer sea-
son, when you may find from one to many
heavily laden boats upon every mile of Clin-
ton's canal, busily making their way from
Buffalo to the Hudson, step aboard a westward
bo nd train in eastern New York at mid-day,
and before you close your eyes in sleep, just
east of Niagara, you shall count, as I have
done, twenty, thirty ponderous trains of freight,
creaking and groaning under their heavy loads
of western produce as they go thundering
along down the valley of the Mohawk, seek-
ing the seaboard at the city of New York.
If, as a western man, you experience some
sense of pride to meet these accumulated evi-
dences of astonishing development, it is only
to be followed by the bitter, reflection that
instead of belonging to your neighbors as pro-
ducers and shippers, at least fifteen trains out
of the thirty belong to the railroad companies
for carrying the other fifteen from the Mis-
sissippi valley to the seaboard, saying nothing
of the further cost of transit thence to the
Liverpool markets. If this state of things be
remedied soon, as it may and ought to be, the
advancement and prosperity of the far interior
States may be continued indefinitely ; but if
,you leave us in the condition we now are, we
must soon reach a limit beyond which it will
be impossible to pass.
But we shall not even remain stationary
relative to this great question of transporta-
tion. The difficulty grows upon us year by
year. The States clustering around the lakes
and stretching across to the base of the mount-
ains are not more than one sixth developed,
yet the wheat crop of those States for last year
was over 200,000,000 bushels and that of corn
upward of 1,200,000,000 bushels. Nearly two
thirds of the pork, quite two thirds of the
wheat, and nearly if not quite three fourths
of the corn in the entire country, is produced
in those States now. What, sir, will be the
aggregate of the products and what the trans-
portation adequate to it in the coming years
of the future?
But it is not only the want of adequate fa-
cilities, it is especially the cost of transporta-
tion which oppresses- our people now, and
which will grind them unless it be changed.
The railroads have been and will remain a great
blessing to the country, a great convenience
to the traveler, and for the carrying of those
many articles of commerce which require
rapid transit; yet they never have furnished,
and in my judgment never can furnish, cheap
transportation for the millions of tons of bulky
farm products which from this time forward
must annually be carried from one to four
thousand miles eastward. The cost of con-
struction, depots, rolling-stock, operating ex-
penses, and keeping in repair has hitherto
prevented, and will in all human probability
continue to prevent the railroads from reducing
their freight tariffs below two cents per ton
per mile. This would be an average of about
seventy cents per bushel for all wheat carried
from the Mississippi valley to the city of New
York. Averaging the price of wheat from
year to year, while the present mode of ex-
portation continues, the farmer of my district
who raises two thousand bushels of wheat
must manage to meet the expense of raising
the crop, feed and clothe his family, and pay
his taxe'S out of one thousand bushels, and
offer the other thousand to the earner tor put-
ting down his crop at the New York wharves.
Apply this expenditure to the cheaper com-
modity of corn, and the deplorable condition
of its producer must be appreciable.
I see by the New York Times of February
10 that "good new mixed western corn is
quoted in that market at sixty-six to sixty-
six and a half cents per bushel. With a rate
of freight sometimes in excess ot that price,
seldom much below it, the bountiful crops ot
corn with which Providence favored the coun-
try last year, is of so little value m the burst-
ing granaries of the West, that when I visited
my home during the> holidays .1 found my
neighbors in stores and offices, burning corn
for fuel as being more economical 1
Here are two extracts taken from two Iowa
newspapers of November last:
" The proprietors of the Ogden House,' in' Council
Bluffs, are using corn as a common article of Justin
all the rooms of their extensive establishment, find-
ing it altogether cheapcr and more economical than
either wood or coal* although the price of neither is
extravagant—indeed, is very moderate."
" We are informed, which is no doubt oorreot, that
the farmers in "all the prairie country of this valley
are burning their corn for fuel, finding it altogether
oheaper and more economical than wood or ooal,
although the latter, of excellent quality, can he ob-
tained at any of the railroad stations at from throo
to three dollars and a half per ton: and wood will
not exceed four dollars per cord. We may well ask,
what are we all coming to ? Are, wo never to have
any relief from this state of affairs? Corn in New
York city is at least eighty-five cents a bushel, and
here our people are burning it to keep themselves
from freezing. Other agricultural products are
nearly as worthless. It will tako three bushels of
wheat and three fat hogs to get the fourth to mar-
ket. There is a grievous wrong somewhere. Is
it in Congress? We should be reluctant to believe
so."
With this exorbitant cost of freightage,
amounting to an embargo upon the shipment
of corn, you perceive that the crops of the
Iowa farmer is deprived of its "mobilior"
while the farmer himself soon will be deprived
of his " credit."
Again, sir, I join the millions iii asking the
construction of this canal, as furnishing the
shortest and best avenue which can be obtained
for the immense western commerce. The
whole distance from Chicago to Liverpool Via
Montreal and New York is 4,776 miles, while
the distance between those points via the river
and G-ulf of St. Lawrence is 3,716 miles, making
a saving of idistance over the former route of
1,060 miles. From the same point to Liverpool
via Erie oatiaL and New York is 4,899 miles,
or 639 miles further than by the proposed route.
Besides, if this work is completed as proposed,
with navigable capacity, say of eighteen feet,
equal to that of the lakes, the expensive bur-
den of transshipment will be saved, and the
capacity of this thoroughfare be sufficient both
for the present and the future, being practically
unlimited. In order to demonstrate the full
saving which it is believed may be thus secured,
I present the following tables which were sub-
miited to the Committee on Commerce by the
representatives of the Detroit commercial con-
vention, and they add in a foot-note that these
rail and canal charges are the lowest ever made,
and in times of pressure that higher rates are
exacted:
Route by rail to the, lakes, thence by lake to Buffalo, thence by the Eric canal and Hudson river,
to New York, thence to Liverpool.

From these tables it appears that with the
facilities asked for the shipper at Dubuque,
Iowa, on the western bank of the Mississippi
river, can make a saving upon a ton of freight
shipped to the foreign market at Liverpool
amounting to the sum of $6 93, or a saving of
twenty aud one fifth cents upon each bushel
of wheat. Does any one say this is theory,
and that the results of practice seldom approx-
imate closely to the standard of theory ? I hen
I ask him to discount it, if he will; to reduce
it one hundred per cent, it he deems
but to make the calculation for himself, andhe
will find that even when so reduced the saving
upon the entire wheat crop of the States west
of Brie and north of the Ohio river for last
year alone would amount to the enormous, sum
of $20,000,000, more than sufficient to com-
plete the groat improvement provided for m
this bill. . ,, •„
Why, sir, the committee reporting upon this
subject to the Thirty-Fifth Congress say:
" It would hardly be credible did not figures dem-
onstrate tho fact, that a saving ot ten cents per ton
on freight passing through this gateway v?0ukl
amount to SbSliOOOper annum, taking the tonnage
of 1856 for computation."
Then I ask him to make a fair calculation
of the entire saving upon alt the commodities
transported between the West and the eastern
and foreign markets for a single year; and
then to agree witli me, that this work ought
not to be longer delayed.
Our States at the West invite largely to
agriculture. Their leading source of wealth
lies in the abundant products of the soil. But
the employment of the farmer has become far
less remunerative than that of almost any
other. We hear much in these Halls and else-
where of taxation bearing heavily upon the
people; and it is, and must for some time to
come continue, a burden. But, it is as a feather
compared with the tax which takes more than
a moiety in the way of freight, which must bo
deducted from the market price of his product,
and thus reduces the amount he receives, unnl
his yearly toil and magnificent harvest recedes
into a profiileas pursuit. Change this, as you
can doj by giving him greatly reduced freights
and thus enable him to save the greater por-
tion of the market value ol his crops; give
him some profit for his summer's labor, and
he will not only meet his legitimate taxes with-
