and at the same time to give some reward for meritorious conduct, a system of furloughs is hereby instituted in the army. These furloughs will be granted in the first instance at the rate of 2 for every 100 men present for duty. This system will be continued so long as the exigencies of the service will permit, should the effects by not found prejudicial. Commanders of regiments and battalions will forward on each occasion the most urgent and meritorious cases for approval of superior commanders. The time will be regulated according to the following table: Virginia, 15 days; North Carolina, 18 days; South Carolina, 21 days; Georgia and Tennessee, 24 days; Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and East Louisiana, 30 days. Furloughs will be granted equally to the soldiers from States and district with which communication is cut off, but in no case will these furloughs carry permission to go within the enemy's lines or pass through them. The time for such cases will be regulated by the number of days allowed for the State in the above list which they intend to visit. The application will in every instance be made out and indorsed after the inclosed form. The men furloughed will be authorized to bring back all stragglers and recruits who may come in their way.

By command of General Lee:

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA,August 16, 1863.

I am directed by General Lee to say that he desires to allow men to go home on furlough at the rate of 2 to every 100 men present for duty, for the first lot who go. When these return, the rate is to be reduced to 1 for every 100 men present for duty. This explanation is made, as the language in General Orders, Numbers 84, may not be readily understood.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
