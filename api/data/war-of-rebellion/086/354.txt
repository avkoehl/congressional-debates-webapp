COLONEL: I take the opportunity of forwarding to you copies of orders found on the body of Bill Anderson:

OCTOBER 11, 1864.

TO THE OFFICER IN CHARGE OF FERRY-BOAT:

Captain Anderson, with his command, will be crossed to the other side of the river, after which the ferry-boat will await orders on this side.

MACLEAN,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

SPECIAL ORDER.] HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF MISSOURI,

Boonville, October 11, 1864.

Captain Anderson, with his command, will at once proceed to the north side of the Missouri River and permanently destroy the North Missouri Railroad, going as far east as practicable. He will report his operations at least every two days.

By order of Major-General Price:

MACLEAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Assistant Adjutant-General.

On Anderson's body was also found his likeness and that of his wife, a small Confederate flag with these words inscribed on it: "Presented to W. L. Anderson by his friend, F. M. R. Let it not be contaminated by Fed. hands." He also had letters from his wife from Texas, and a lock of her hair, about $600 in gold and greenbacks. His body, while at Richmond Court-House, was recognized by several persons. We have heard of the band, some 300 in number, crossing the river at Brunswick bound south; they acknowledge having had a fight with some Ray County militia, and that Bill Anderson was killed on the 27th. I shall have his likeness in a day or two and I will have some taken and send you one. I trust the general is getting along well and that our troubles are nearly at an end.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES RAINSFORD,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

P. S.-Maclean was clerk in a banking house in this city. His hand writing has been recognized here by several persons who knew him.
