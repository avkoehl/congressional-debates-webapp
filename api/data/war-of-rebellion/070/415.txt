your two columns will frustrate their plans. Nevertheless, as a precautionary measure I have ordered a section of Keeper's battery from Webster to Colonel Harris. All quiet along line of road. Two Ohio regiments have arrived at Parkersburg, one of which I have ordered to New Creek and the other here. I am exceedingly anxious to have some good cavalry. We must kill, capture, or drive McNeill out of the country before we can except quiet or safety along line of road.

The two Ohio regiments at Parkersburg have been ordered forward. Two other Ohio regiments were ordered via Wheeling and should have been there ere this. You need not, however, hold the cars any longer for them. If they arrive they will wait at Benwood till you can furnish the transportation.
