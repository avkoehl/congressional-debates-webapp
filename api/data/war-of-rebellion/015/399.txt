The casualties occurring in my company during the engagement are as follows: Total number wounded, 7; killed none.

While I greatly regret loss of the one gun and caisson, I am pleased to be able to report that the non-commissioned officers and privates of my company, while under heavy fire from the enemy's guns, fired these their first shots with a coolness and precision highly gratifying to me, and with evident effect and damage to the enemy.

I was assisted only by one commissioned officer, First Lieutenant J. C. Marquis, who performed his duty with judgment and bravery; Second Lieutenant T. J. Burke being absent as recruiting officers and Third Lieutenant William Blackburn absent on sick furlough.

I have the honor to remain, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JAMES H. WATERS,

Commanding W. A. Artillery.

Numbers 35. Report of Captain Joseph Carpenter, Virginia Artillery.
HEADQUARTERS CARPENTER'S BATTERY,March 27, 1862.

GENERAL: In obedience to General Orders, 43, I make the following report of the part taken by my company in the engagement of Sunday, the 23rd instant:

I received orders at 1.20 o'clock to take two of my pieces, without caissons, and follow the infantry across a wood wets of the Valley turnpike.

After proceeding some half or three-quarters of a mile we observed to our front and right some three regiments of infantry and some cavalry, when we were ordered to open fire upon them; we did so. After firing some ten rounds they retired to the wood in the rear,

when I ceased firing.
