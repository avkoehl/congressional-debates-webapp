THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
February 7,
by that committee, there la no other mode of
aruving at that result than by instructing the com-
mittee to report forthwith
Mr A had no objection to any arrendment
which the honorable cnairman of the Committee
on Foreign Relations, [Mr Cambreleng,] or
any other member, might propose, who thought
it necebsary to allow that committee further time
to consider the subject, but he deemed it important
that, as we were then within a short month of the
termination of the session, and as from the cor
respondencejust read, as well as from the reports
in general cnculation throughout the country, he
thought it exceedingly doubttul whether anything
more definitive would be received with respect to
the action of the French Government upon that
treaty. The letter from Mr Livingston of the
6th of December, the day after the new French
ministry had obtained what that gentleman called
a victory, speaks in very sanguine terms of the
probability of the Chamber of Deputies passing
the bill of appropriations But what did his sub-
sequent letter, dated fifteen days afterwaids,say'
He tells us that the new ministry were far from
willing to hazard their popularity upon piopoamg
the bill Well, then, Mi Livingston concluded
with saying that he was by no means sanguine,
and other reports, from Pans, and from almost
every other source, concuired in stating thattheie
was no prospect whatever that the French Cham-
ber would make any appropriation to piovide for
the paymen t of this debt That was also the gen
eral tenor of all the puvate communications from
Paris Now,underthesecircumstances,he thought
it time for that House to take up the proposition
of the President of the United States at the com
mencement of the present session, to take it up,
and see whether that House would do what the
Pi esident proposed upon the happening of a con-
hngcncy, which Mi A considered as scarcely
iongej a contingency He considered the subse-
quent despatch of Mr Livingston as equivalent to
ascertaining the fact, that the contingency contem-
plated by the message of the President, would be
turned into a reality, that la to say, ascertaining
that the IVench Chamber of Deputies would do
nothing
Mr A. did not undertake to say that what the
President had recommended at the commencement
of the session would be the wisest and the most
proper course, but he would say this much, that
he believed it the duty of the House to act upon
this subject, and declare whethei they would com-
ply with the proposition of the President, or that
they would do something to sustain the rights,
interests, and honor of the nation, and that the
chanman of the Committee on Foreign Relations,
in asking for further time, was not pursuing the
best course Mr A found himself desirous that
the committee should make their íeport He had
not tied down the committee by proposing in-
structions as to what they should repott, he only
asked that they should report A member of the
committee, some days since, did propose specific
instructions, but the House thought proper, by
a very Bmall majority, to reject the pioposition
As the time passed, however, it became more im
penous, moie absolutely necessary for the House
to act upon this important subject For himself,
he desired action, and in the mean time, between
this and the close of the session of Congress, any-
thing more favorable should turn up, action on the
?art of the House could do no wrong Let the
louse say to the nation, and to the world, that
they would sustain the President in the proposi
tion he made Let them say so to the world, and if
their declaration went to Europe, and if it should
be found that the French Chamber of Deputies
had made the appropriation, it could do no harm,
but it would show that that House felt what was
due to the dignity, the honor, and the interests
of the nation Whatevar might be said of the
message of the President, Mr A , for one, would
say, as was once said in the case of General La
Fayette, that whoever censured its imprudence,
must yet admire its spirit It would go foith to
all mankind as the sustainer of the lights, the
honor, and the interests of this country, and he
hoped the House would not suffer itself to appear
in a contrasted character with the President of
the United States, by shrinking from responsibil
lty, in Older not to commit themselves to the
nation At least, let them have the subject in a
shape to act and dehbeiate up>n, so that they
might declare what they would do, a d how they
would feel when the honor and mteiesta of the
nation were involved
Mr ARCHER opposed the motion of Mr
Adams at some length, on toe ground that it was
premature, tnat its adoption would pWee the Gov
ernment in a wrong attitude, and would be tunta
mount to a declaiation of war He also objected
to the punciple of specially instructing a commit
tee on matters of such deep importance, and re
luctant as he would be, he should be conif elled to
vote against the proposition
Mr CLAYTON alluded to what took place on
tjiis subject at the commencement of the session,
and said he considered that at that time there were
two courses for the body to take, one was to act
up to the spirit of the President's message, the
other was for the representative branch of the
nation to show to the Fiench Government we did
not coincide m that recommendation, and by that
means avert, if possible, all the consequences that
might ensue, but at the same time place the Cham
ber of Deputies in the same situation they would
have been placed in if that message had not been
sent to this House In the latter course, one
branch ot the Government had sustained the mo
tion he made on this su ject at the comme icement
of the present session The Senate had unani
mously íesolved that it was inexpedient at the
present time to adopt any legislative measura in
regaid to the state of affans between the United
States and Franc* That resolution had accom-
plished all he wished upon this subject, and if it
failed to answei the puipose, he had nothing else
m view Ifweweienow to discuss this subject
short of that proposition, whether we should in¡>u
tute acts of hostility against Fiance, it might
involve a collision betwien the two bodies The
unanimous vote of the Senate upon the first ques-
tion presented by him answered his purpose bet
ter than a vote against it by that House Now,
then, if all had been done that could be done to
effect what he had in view, the next inquiiy was,
if it failed, should we proceed until we forced con-
viction that it was necessaiy to proceed upon the
alternative laid down by the Pi esident of the
United States ' Was there testimony before us
of a chaiacter to justify our doing it' Should we
act upon the testimony presented to us, and pro
ceed at once to measuies of hostility' or would it
not be betterforthe Committee on Foreign Affairs
not to make a íeport until they could do it upon
information that would satisfy that House' He
put the question, were gentlemen prepaied to pro-
ceed to what would be considered acts of hostility '
for certainly any legislation growing out of the
testimony before them would íesult in that conse-
quence He thought they would not, and they
ought not so to act Taking this view of the sub-
ject, then, that it was proper for the legislative
branch, or rather the popular branch, of the Gov-
ernment to signify to Prince that they did not
agiee with the President in his recommendation,
and believing that the alternative had not arrived,
he should vote against the motion to instruct the
committee forthwith—reluctantly, because it came
from a very high source, but he did not deem
immediate action eithei expedient or called for
Mi McKlNLEY was pleased to see the gentle-
man from Massachusetts [Mr Adams] evince so
becoming a sp nt on the occasion, and if he would
delay his motion till a reasonable time was given
to hear further fiom France, he (Mr M ) would
go witn him foi instructions to the Committee on
Foreign Affairs, provided they would not make a
proper report without Mr M said that he was
prepared to act decisively on this subject before
the adjournment of Congress The gentleman
from Virginia [Mr Archer] urges forbearance
towards our ancient friend and ally He believes
that the King of the Fiench sincerely desires that
the treaty of the 4 h of July, 1831, should be car
ried into effect, and that we ought not therefore
to can y out the recommendation of the President,
because it may lead to war, we ought not, he
thinks, to involve the country m war for the sum
in controversy
Sn, how long  is this forbearance to be urged
upon us' Theie have been foui sessions of the
French Chambers since the exchange of ratifica-
tions of tht treaty At fie fiit,t, the sutjtct w s
| not noticed at tue second, which last J about four
months, it w«s laid befoie ú s Chamoer of Deju-
tie;> l ineteen d lys only befoie the adjournment,
the bill was refenpd to a committee, and theie
the mattei enced, tne next session continued about
three months, and fi teen day5 bef re the adjourn
ment the rubject w is agan brought to the con«id
eration of the Chamber of Deputies, but not acted
upon, and, finally, at the ses&ion of Apul, 1834,
the question was fu'ly discussed by the Deputies-,
and the bill containing the necessary appropiiation
rejec ed
Suppose it be true that the King ente-tams the
most sincere desire to have the stipulations of the
tieaty pel 'ormed to the very letlei, and that that
oepartment of the Government which holds the
purse strings refuse to furnish the meaiib toenab'e
him to have it done, does that good feeling on
thepirtof the Kiig furnish a sufficient reason
foi continual foibearance on our part' If so, 'he
stipulations need never be performed,and still we
n ust forbear I have no doubt of the smcfity of
the professions of the King, and if the execution
of thetieatydepended upon his will alone, I would
delay its execution foi any reabonable length of
time to meet his convenience But when we know
that a ccoidmate department of the Government,
claiming and exeicising the right to pieventits
execution, has twice neglected to consider the
subject when biought to its rotice, and has once,
upon fu 1 deliberation, refused to appropriate the
necessaiy sum to enable the King to comply with
the solemn stipulations of the treaty, are we still
to forbeai' And upon what reasons' Because
France has been our ancient friend and ally,
because the Chambers are now in session, anil
may possibly reconsider the suuject, retiace their
steps, and at some future, indefinite pe lod con
descend to make the appropiiation ' And because,
too, it is for a paltry sum of money—much lets
than it would cost to coeice payment' At what
time and upon what reasons do gentlemen pio-
pose that forbeaiance shall cease' The propo-
sition is wholly indefinite It is true that the
Fiench Chambers are in session, and have been
since the 1st of December, and it is equally true
that down to the 22 I they had not even noticed
the subject of the treaty They have heretofoie
omitted to act on the subject at their successive
sessions, and at the fourth rejected the bill If
these acts teach us no thing but foibearance, simi'ar
acts can but teach a similai lesson, and time can
bring us no nearer the termination of the contio-
versy
But, sir, if this ancient friendship, which once
so happily subsisted between France and the
United States, ought to induce us to bear and for-
beai , have we not done so' Our j ist claims against
that nation remained unsettled for more than
twenty years, and then we agreed to accept a Itttle
more than half of what we were entitled to, rather
than have a rupture with our ancient friend and
ally After the amount was liquidated and pay
ment stipulated by tieaty, neaily four yeais more
nave rolled round, and the debt has not yet been
paid, nay, payment has been absolutely lefused
Who is in the right, and who in the wrong, in
this controversy' There has been nothing but
forbearance on the part of the United States, and
nothing but aggression on the part of France
Can friendship be pieserved by such humiliating
submission on our part' Not only Fiance, but
all the world, must feel a con empt for us if we
adjourn without acting with proper spirit and
dignity—after such protracted injury and injus
tice
Sir, are we to refrain from taking the most
pacific means that can be adopted, by one nation
towards another, to compel the payment of a just
debt merely because it may lead to war with an
ancient fnend ' Why do gentlemen refuse to look
at the other side of this question ' If the fnend-
ship is to be preserved by kindness, forbearance,
and good offices, is it not necessary that the acts
should be observed by Trance as well as the United
States' If íeprisals might lead to war, might not
the infraction of a tieaty lead to war also ' Will
any one deny that the tieaty of the 4th of July
