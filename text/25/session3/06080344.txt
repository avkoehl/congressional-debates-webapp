OF KENTUCKY,
Is the House op Representatives,
February 15, 1839,
On the bill making appropnapons for the civil and diplo-
matic service for the year 1839
Mr POPEsaiJ-
Mr Chaiumiv. I hope that no apology is ne-
cessaiy on my pait foi aJdiessing the committee
at t'i s time at large on the several topics of pub-
lic policy and politico principles to which the
attention of the countiy has been called in our
debates, here and elsewheie, and in the public
jiuirah My colleague, [Mi. Chambers,] the
able and faithful chairman of the Committee of
Claims, knows that I have icmamed at my post,
late and early, to aid him to obtain the action of
the House m favor of the poor and humble and
Buffering cmz ns who have fair demands on oui
justice, and the chairman of the Committee of
Ways and Means, of which I am a membci, will
have the candoi to admit thulhavc not (alien
(i couise to impede his Admmistiation meisuies,
wnether I concurred with him or not I have
been evei willing to afford him a fan oppoitumty
to present them, with his views, to the constdi i
ation of the House and natnn in oidot that
the necessary public business might be done at
this shoit session, I have abstained fiom wtstitig
time in Ubeless debate on plun and uiumpoitant
¡subjects, and I would exhoit gentlemen of the
legal proftss on, v. ho so often hnmmci us foi two
or thiee houis, like an ignoiant ]uiy, on tute
questions, to believe that those of us who a e not
1 md of speaking mciely foi thestke of->pciking
have some small stock of sense and mfoiinatton
as well as themselves
I am inclined topiesent my views on the po] t
ral state of the  nihon, and the piinciplis and
measures involved in the  approaching contisl,
not only to this House and the public, but to my
immediate constituents, to whom I am tlmetly
responsible, and before whom I am to appeu at
the approaching election in August  next     It is
my duty to tit at them with fairntss and candoi,
to explain my position here, nnd to give, th m
my opinion on public affaus   The ci is is is die ply
intei citing to every American citizen, and icquires
every man to speak out with decision, calmness,
and tiuth     A man of ohseivation, who takes a
survey of the piesent state of things in this coun-
try, will be surpnscd to discovei  that questions
of policy, constitutional  law, and  all  sulpcts
connected with the course ol the National Gov
einment, are less settled and  more  afloat than
forty or foity five years ago, when  our present
Constitution was fust put into piactical opeiation

utiluy of such an institution as a fiscal agent and

I am constrained, Mr  Chairman, to express
Party Politics—Mr. P&pe.
my high approbation of the manner in which m,y
colleague, [Mr. Murray,] the other day, made
the best defense I have heard of the course of the
Admmistiation. It isjust to sayto htm,if he has
not convinced me of the soundness of his views,
and correctness of the facts he has asseited, that
his course in this debate has been marked by that
decorum and propriety which ought to charac
terize this representative body He has not ap-
plied to his adversaries offensive epithets or un-
popular names, or dealt in mere denunciation of
his political opponents, he has not substituted
the terms Democrats, Whigs, or Federalists, for
aigument. He has considered the two great par-
ties which now divide the country as suppoiteis
and opponents of the Administration. Those who
believe, as he does, that the principles and meas-
ures of this Administration are sound and will
conduce to the preservation of the public liberty
and to advance the general prosperity, ought to
support it, and it is the duty of those who entei-
tain a contiaiy opinion to oppose it A gentle-
man, by calling himself a Democrat or a Whig,
does not prove the course of the Administration
right or wrong. The tendency of the pnnciples
and meisuiesof the Admmistiation is to be shown
by leason, ¡iigcimint, and fact, and not by meie
nami s and electionceunii slang When I hear
mernbeis of this House t ilk ot D mociats and
Demoriacy, to piove one paity light and the
ntliet wiring, I am leminded of a conversation I
had with Mi Gulf on Gi mgei, a citizen of Con
nu ti ut, tin ity yea is ago, when Postmaster Gen- j

In one of the ncwspapeis theie was an account (
of a 1 irge meeting of the people of New Iliven,

nc ss, s >mt of the icveu nd cleigy were called on i

A man in my own Slate of some inti lligence,
many yeais ago, made a deep impiession on me i
in n ft lonee to this subject     lie told me that a i
son of his, a distinguish! d citizen of Tennessee, j
fiom the commencement of his caieei in life, had [
detei mined to act on the assumed ground that the
people weie to be fooli d by somebody, and that ,
a man was a fool who did not fool them for his
ovv n advantage     And not many years ago, I ad-   |
dies^ed the people at what i& called a candidate's
meeting, and expl lined my views of a n Uional
benk, besides touching on other topics     In the
evening, aftei the people had dispeised, a warm   j
peisonil fuend of mine, of good talents, whom
I consideicd, as eveiybody else did, among the
most thoiough going Demociats, rode with me a   j
few miles, and in the couise of oui conveisation,
observed that the world  supposed  me to have   j
much moie sense than him, but, said hc,theyaie

about a nati inal Lank, give lirge national and   '
extende 1 views of the benefits and utility of such
an institution, but veiy f vv of your heaieis can
I appieciate the ments of what you consider states-
I manlike aigument     Now, says he, I go for De-
mocracy and Government, oi  treasuiy people's \
' built     I have no fauh, said he, in this Democra-
cy, but it is the road to success.    I lell you, I
have no faith in it, but I am determined to go for
Democracy, and no fellow shall out Democuttme
lie assured me that he would support me, when
a candidate, whethei I was right or wiong, but
he must condemn my opinions befoie the people,
foi I tell j on, said he, that I don't intend to Le
beaten at the game of Democracy
¡     Mi   Chairman, I have no paiticular objection
tothe word Demociat, Whig.or Feddahst   Gen-
' tlemen are at liberty to assume any name they
1 please, but I protest against the use of any such
| epithets to piove a mcasuie right or wiong.   lie
I had been, and evei should be, democratic in hi3
I feelings and actions towards his fellow men. He
Ho. of Reps.
had never oppressed the poor, or dealt hardly
with them; and m his public couise, both in the
Kentucky Legislatuie and in Congress, he had
been uniform in defending the fair claims of the
actual and bona fide settleis of our new lands He
was in favoi of a kind and liberal policy towards
the poorei classes, who, unable to purchase lands
at high prices in the old and rich States, had mi-
grated to the new and unsettled regions of the
West. Some of his public acts may have been
wrong, and some of his opinions, and especially
about a national bank, were called by many Fed-
eral He had formed his opinion on that subject
at an eaily period of his congressional caieer,
after piofound consideration and an earnest in-
quiry after tiuth He had maintained that opinion
through good and evil report, and had discovered
no good reason to change it Whether his opinion
was called Federal or Democratic, was a matter
of indifference to him; and he had little respect
for a man who was afraid to obey the conviction
of his understanding, lest he should be called Fed-
eralist, Wli g, Democrat, or anything else. Let
eveiy man be peisuaded in his own mind that he
is right, and go ahead
Mr Chairman, I repeat that I like the course
of my colleague in recognizing but two parties—
the paityfor the Admmistiation, and the paity
against it Those who disapprove of the princi-
ples and measures of the Administration owe it
to themselves, their country, and their immediate
constituents, to put m good and substantial pleas
in bai to their continuance in power with a veri-
fication, and to sustain their pleas by proof and
argument at the bar of the nation. Theieare,
howevei, some other parties or squads of parties
th it merit a passing notice I hear of a State-
nghts paity, whose creed I would be as much at
a loss to define as that of the Moimon paity of
the fn West I do not know any anti-State-
ughts men anywheie. If there aie such, I know
them not I have heaid of anti-Masonic party;
and we have an abolition party, more dangerous
in its chaiactei, tendency, and objects than any
which has arisen since the foundation of this Gov-
ernment—a party which threatens to weaken, if
notdesttoy,oui Union, disturb our domestic tian-
quillity, and shake the foundation of private prop-
el ty Until lately, I have been disposed to receive
their petitions without attaching much import-
ance to them, but I am now satisfied that no such
petitions, tending to engender discord here, and
distuib the general tranquillity, ought to be re-
ceived I had not befoie this felt any serious
concern about ihismatter, for I have never known
a Yankee emigrant to the South or Southwest to
set a slave fi ee A very cultivated and intelligent
gentleman fiom New Hampshire settled in my
neighboihood about twelve or fouiteen years ago,
and was at fiist clamorous and rude m his íe-
marks about slaves and slaveholder Aftei he
had been with us two or three years, he took a
f mey to a fine widow, a fuend of mine, who had
some vciy valuable slaves Some of hei coun-
selor were opposed to the match,and she, know-
ing thai 1 was veiy much disposed to encouiage
matrimony, and that I would advise her to do
piecisely what she wanted to do, conveised with
me upon the subject Having nevei indulged or
excited prejudices against Yankees, I told her
that the fiist article in their creed was to provide
well for their household, that he would make a
good husband,and uiged hei to many him, which
she did, and then union has been fortunate and
happy, and he has never, I believe, said one word
about abolition from that day to this. He is a
good husband, and a much better master than
most of us, for he gets twice as much labor out
of his slaves as I ever could.
Mi Chairman, about the close of the last war
I felt proud that we had at the city of New Oi-
leans a military chieftain who, by his bravery
and military skill, defended our soil against the
finest army that ever crossed the Atlantic, and
shed a luster on our national character. About
the same time, I was giatified to learn that we
had an enlightened statesman, an intellectual
Hercules, at the head of the American mission at
Ghent, sent to negotiate a tieaty of peace with
Great Bntain, who, with the weapons of reason
and argument, vanquished the first statesmen of
the British empire on the contested question about
