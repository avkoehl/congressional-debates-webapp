this morning. Will you inquire about the 150 muskets said to be with First U. S. Colored, so that arrangements may be made to distribute them among the dismounted men. I propose to send those men to Bowers' Hill so as to strengthen the mounted force at Bernard's Mill.

I. VOGDES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

PORTSMOUNTH, May 18, 1864.

General SHEPLEY,

Commanding:

Major Gates left on a scouting expedition toward Suffolk this morning. I have not yet heard any report from him. I have sent him 100 of the dismounted men to strengthen his position at Bowers' Hill. The only other point threatened at all is Deep Creek. As soon as Major Gates returns I will have a scout in that direction.

I. VOGDES,

Brigadier-General.

PORTSMOUNTH, May 18, 1864.

General SHEPLEY:

Nothing new in the front. Are there any troops at Fort Monroe that can be spared? I will send you word in order to have the North Carolina Regiment as soon as any advancement to this place.

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

I shall make a flank movement early in the morning, and try to reach Bowling Green and Milford Station. If successful, Port Royal will be more convenient as a depot than Fredericksburg. I wish you would stir up the navy and see if they cannot reach there.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMIES OF THE UNITED STATES,May 19, 1864-10 p.m. (Received 1 a.m. 20th.)

Major General H. W. HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

The enemy came out on our right late this afternoon and attacked, but were driven back until some time since dark. Not knowing their exact position, and the danger our trains at Fredericksburg will be in if we move, I shall not make the move designated for to-night until their designs are fully developed. We captured men from three different divisions of the enemy; all from Ewell's corps.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
