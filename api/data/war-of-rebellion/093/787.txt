I desire to refer to the valuable and efficient services rendered me on the march and during the action by Captain Sam. Henderson, commanding independent company of scouts, who is ever ready, courteous, and highly gallant on all occasions, and particularly so on this.

Reliable reports from Jones' scouts were sent to me that the enemy moved down the opposite side of the Yazoo River and crossed a portion of his forces at Satartia, where these scouts fired upon them, which caused them to recross the stream immediately [and] build a pole road across the swamp below, during which such confusion prevailed among them that many attempted to flee, and lost their horses in the mud to a number exceeding 100.

It may not be improper to add that the citizens of Yazoo County whose homes lay near our line of march visited our camps in appreciation of the position and series of the troops, conveyed promptly all reliable intelligence serviceable to a commander, and rendered valuable aid as guides, and tendered every courtesy and hospitality to officers and men.

I have the honor to be, captain, your very obedient servant,

JOHN GRIFFITH,

Colonel, Commanding Brigade.
