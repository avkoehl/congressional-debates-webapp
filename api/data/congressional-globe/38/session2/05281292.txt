§78,620
These tables illustrate the question of cleik
hue-, they give the number of names in thousands
assessed m retch district, the picseut late allowed
for cleik hue in each district, and the amount
which would be aiiowed for clerk hire in each dis-
tt jet, calculated after the rate named m the amend-
ment, seventy cents for each one hundred names.
I have already stated that this amendment would
save to the Tteasury about fifty thousand dollars,
nnd yet [ have said and the tables will show that
if will increase the allowance for clerk hire in more
than half the districts of the United States. With
reference to the question of stationei y, I only wish
to say that i have been furnished with a list of
thirty-eijjht districts in difleient States of the
United States assessing in the aggregate three
hundred and eighteen thousand names, where the
whole amountallowed for stationery in $3,110 99;
arid [ have been given another district, a single
distiict, in the State of .New York, the thirty-
second district, where twenty-four thousand
names are assessed, and $3,071 40 is allowed for
stationery, within a few dollars of the amount
allowed in the other thirty-eight districts.
i could give some fuithcr curious illustrations
of the way this amendment will affect the ex-
penses in different districts, i will mention two
or three. It would decrease the amountallowed
for cleik hire in every district in Massachusetts,
I think, but one, arid it would increase that$S90.
In the State of Maryland it would decrease the
cost in one district $90, and increase the cost in
every other district, one |110, one $240, one <U10,
and one $90. In the State of Illinois it would
decrease the cost in two districts and increase the
amount in all the other districts of that State. In
the State ofMichigan it would increase the amount
aiiowed to the assessors, in one district $540, in
another district $240, in another district §170, in
another district #230, in another $30, in another
$190, and would not decrease it in a single dis-
trict. It would increase it in every district in the
State of Iowa; it would increase it in every dis-
trict but one in the State of Wisconsin; it would
increase it in every district in Vermont; it would
increase it in the District of Columbia; but it
would decrease the cost in some districts in the
State of New York very heavily; in one district
$3,32U, in another $3,320, in another $2,520. It
would decrease it in the State of Pennsylvania
in a large number of districts, and make very
heavy discounts on the present cost. In the State
of I ndiana it would increase the cost in every dis-
trict in the State.
Mr. SPRAGUE. Will the gentleman give
way for a motion to take a recess?
Mr. HOWE. 1 will give way for a vote on
the question in one moment. It is a matter that
interests rne no more than it does every other
Senator and every other tax-payer. 1 thought it
proper, however, inasmuch as these tables had
been furnished me and 1 understood them to be
correct, to lay thetn before the country and let
them see what it is the Legislature will not agree
to correct.
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. SHERMAN. 'I1 here are one <5r two
verbal amendments to winch my attention has
been called since the action of the committee.
Mr. SPRAGUE. I move that the chairman
be authorized to make the corrections.
Mr. SHERMAN. 1 would notmke that liberty.
I have not got them now. They are not very
material at any rate; they are verbal. Let the
bill proceed.
The amendments were ordered to be engrossed
and the hill to be read a third time. The bill was
read the third time.
The PRESIDING OFFICER, (Mr. Foster
in the chair.) The question is, Shall the bill pass ?
Mr. POWELL. I am opposed to the bill. I
am for no bill taxing the State banks ten per
cent, and taxing sales.
_ Mr. McDOUGALL. Mr. President, I do not
rise to discuss anything at length, but simply to
make some few affirmations 
Mr. SHERMAN. Will my friend allow me
to insert the words " meters and'other apparatus"
after " hydrometer" in a certain place ?
Mr. McDOUGALL. Certninly,
ThePRESIDING OFFICER. Itcan be dune
by unanimous consent.
Mr. SHERMAN. I move after the word
" amended," in lino two bundled and ten, to in-
sert " by inserting after the word ( hydrometer*
the words 6 meters and other apparatus.' "
The amendment was agreed to by unanimous
consent.
. Mr. SHERMAN. I mow before "by," in
line four hundred and ninety-nine, to insert (l by
striking- out of the first paragraph relating to
su^ar the words * brown or muscovado,' and by
striking out of the second paragraph relating to
sugar the words, { clarified or refined,' and by
striking out of the third paragraph relating to
sugar the words * or clarified or refined.' "
Mr. CLARK. These words were omitted by
mistake.
