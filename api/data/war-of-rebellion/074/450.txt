Having advanced a distance of half a mile the skirmishers became briskly engaged, charged and drove the enemy from a strong line of rifle-pits, and held them until relieved by a brigade of the Fifteenth Army Corps. September 4, the brigade was ordered to a position on the right of the Seventeenth Army Corps, where it threw up a strong line of works. On the night of the 5th the brigade, with the army, withdrew from before the enemy, and arrived at the old rebel works near East Point, Ga., on the 8th instant.

The Ninth Illinois Mounted Infantry having been detached on various duties during the campaign, I know but little of the details of its operations, but from its past history I am warranted in saying it has performed an equal part in the labors and duties of a long and severe campaign.
