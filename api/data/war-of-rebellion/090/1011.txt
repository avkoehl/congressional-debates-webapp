to give you an idea of the condition of the command and of the difficulties with which the commanding officer has had to contend. The most of the troops are now in East Tennessee, in the vicinity of Bull's Gap, where the enemy have lately been making some demonstrations.

I shall at once commence the use of every effort to bring out and organize properly all of the reserve troops in the department. I have given orders for immediate arrangements to be made to bring out of that portion of East Tennessee now under our control all the surplus wheat therein, of which I understand there is a considerable quantity, and I hope to be able to effect something in this way. Brigadier-General Morgan is in the immediate command of the troops in the field in East Tennessee.

I am, general, very respectfully, &amp; c.,

JNO. ECHOLS,

Brigadier-General, & c.

* Not including Wharton's division or the cavalry. The report for Wharton's division shows an aggregate of 503 of Echols' (Patton's) brigade, and of 638 of Wharton's brigade "present at inspection;" but gives no indications whatever of the strength of Smith's brigade, nor does it give the stations of these troops. Inspection report of this date for the cavalry not found.

+ Note on original says, "Composed of the remnants of the Virginia regiments of Johnson's division."

# Hays' and Stafford's brigades.
