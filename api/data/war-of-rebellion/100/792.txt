RALEIGH, N. C., April 12, 1865.

President DAVIS:

A letter was sent by me to Sherman this morning requesting an interview. It was shown to General Hardee, and the subject-matter was mentioned to General Johnston yesterday. It is not my intention to do anything subversive of your prerogative or without consultation with yourself.

Z. B. VANCE.

APRIL 12, 1865.

[Governor Z. B. VANCE:]

I could not attribute to you such purpose as you disclaim, and your military experience and good judgment will render it unnecessary to explain why the commanding general cannot properly allow any intercourse with the enemy except under his authority and with his full knowledge and consent. Such was the purport of the instructions sent to General Hardee.

JEFF'N DAVIS.
