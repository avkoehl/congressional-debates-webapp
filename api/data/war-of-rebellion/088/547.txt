Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I have the honor to report that nothing unusual has transpired on my front during the past twenty-four hours. Some little picket-firing occurred in front of the Fourth Division about 9.30 p. m. No enemy has been seen, excepting two or three, probably scouts, about one mile in our front. The First and Third Divisions have relieved the Fourth on the line and it is now going into camp in the vicinity of the Gurley hose. I propose moving my headquarters to-day to the vicinity of the Aiken house.

August 27, 1864.

Colonel MONROE,

Chief of Artillery, Ninth Corps:

Eight guns from your corps are ordered to Baltimore. Send a section each of Eaton's, Rogers', Mayo's, and of Start's batteries to City Point to report to Colonel Bowers, adjutant-general to General Grant. The cannoneers need not go with them. The horses and drivers you will direct to return to their batteries as soon as the guns are turned over at City Point. They will bring back the caissons with them if those are not needed. Rogers' and Start's batteries are with the corps. Eaton's and Mayo's being in the works here, I will give them their orders. I wish you would hurry rogers and Start. Inform me at once of the receipt of this, and your action, and report when the sections leave.

HENRY J. HUNT,

Brigadier-General.
