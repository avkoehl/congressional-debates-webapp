gtbihty ofhía high station?   With all respect for tne honorable
*aná distinguished Senator, I will say that he himself is the last,
the veiy last, man to practise what he preaches    Let him ^
pomtust© asinglecircumstancemhtsown glorious example"
which would sanction any thing like a skulking from duty
Never, never    What are the principles on which the Consii
tuuon is founded?   Is not the Executive Department coerdj
natewith the Legislative, an 1 intended to check, when ovca
«ion requires, an improper exercise of the legislative authoi ity?
The Constitution supposes that such an exercise of the lególa
Uve power may sometimes  happen    It takes it for granted
that Congress may, in an unguarded moment, invade the ngnts
of the States, or commit other violations of the mstrumeit
which defines Hs powers    Hence it places in the hand of the
President the veto power, that he may stand in the breach,
and, in the language of his official oath, defend and preserve
and protect the Coostif ution    I am proud to say for the Piesi
'   dent that such an alternative as letting the bill become a law by
the lapse oí the ten days, however it may have presented itself
to the imagination of the honorable Senator, never once entered
the mind of the President    I trust never to see a native of that
proud old Commonwealth, which claims the Senator from Ken
tacky himself as one of the noblest of her sons, fiy to such a re-
fuge.
But the Senator refers us to«nother alternative withm the
powei of the Piesident, viz the usigtiation of his office, and
he adverts to an example in the President's own mstory where
he once resigned his seat in this body r ither than obey mstruc
tions, by giving a vote which he deemed robe a violation of the
Constitution task, in what citcumstancesdui Mr Tylei stand
atthattime? The Legislature of Virginia, which gave the in
structions, were, under the Constitution the constituents of the
Senatoi He is responsible to them, and, according to the uw
jrera&Uy leceived doctrine in Virginia, he was bound to obey or^
"resign But, I ask, doei tbo Countess of ihe United States -stand
in that rotation to the President? Is the President of the United
States the representative ol Cotigiess? He dert\ es his authoiity
from, thesovereign people and the States, justas d> the mem
hera of either House of Congie&s They are both representatives
alike of the people of the United States Will the Senator say
thatthehxecutivotsto h subservient to tliel°gialdtivedepaii
ment oí Government? Vv e have heard much of Executive dic-
tation, however little we have seen ofit. sun e the mauguiatu n
of the present Chief Magistrate, yet, if the dot u ine of the Sena-
tor from Kentucky is to prevail, there w II spring up a standing
legislative dictation and supremacy No sir.no Iht Presi
dent never was meant to be the mere tool oflegislattve^ ill
(Mr Clay here wteiposed I am very sure the ho lorable

He ought, according to the mo lern docmne rather to have re

Veto Message—«Mr. Clay.
mg in whose name he assumed the so ems responsibilities of
his office having given him that internal monitor for hisgui
dance, what oiher was he to consult? The President, under a
deep sense of his responsibihsy to the country in all her gieat
interests a id hopes—constitutional, political, moral, economi-
ca|_has preferred to act a painful and unwelcome part rather
than to betray his duty to the Constitution, which he had sworn
to preserve, protect, and defend" Never were the motives
oi a public servant, in my humble judgment, more woithy of
indulgence and íespect With this conviction rooted m
my mind, I, for one, can never consent to he?r his conduct im-
pugned without raising my poor voice in his defence
Ihe Senator from Kentucky—with no small dramatic effect
—applying the language oí the President, m i elation ¡o his
own case, tithe dissimilar onp of Mr Madron, asked, if James
Madison, by signing the Bank bill of 1816, had forfeited the le
spertofall virtuous men'* It is sufficient to say, as I have al
ready fhown that the encumstances undei whirh Mr Madison
a-Hed, whether refeience be had to htspeisonal opinions or the
public opinion of tho times, weie entirely diffeient, and the Ian
guage of the President, therefore, quoted by tho Senator fiom
Kentucky, cannot, by any violence of implication, be considered
as casting the slightest censure on that venerable and \enerated
name
I beg lea\ e to he indulged with a word oi lwo as to the course
it now devolves upon u-¡ to take The Senatoi from Kentucky
says he hopes we shall goon andSperfed anew Bank bill
While Iavow nyself wilimg, if such a bill shall be pi evented
ai.my jud^mjnt can approve, to give it my support Imustbf 
peimuted to «a> that in my opinion, we shall bfttei c< nsult
oui duty to thecoantiy and the subject i! we Jo not attempt a
second bill at, this time It is i groit, a difllcul , a complex
question It is n question on which tnecnuntiy is moie divided
probably than on anyc her, especially as to the form which
a Dank shall assume I mav concede, ii you please, that theie
u i majonty in the country in 1 i\oi ofa hsri' mstit tion ot
some kind, and which shall render some incidental assistance
tothecmiency and theexchaugfsofthecounirj, yet, as to the
form of the institutuu its powers its capital, and a'l its de
taiN men are moiedmdedin opinion than about anj thing else
No project hasasyei received the support of a rmjority either
of Congtess oi of the people The pi esses e^tn which snppoit
the honoiablo Senatoi, do theniselves now sv> of his bill that it
would havt been inoperative, and us io^s is no calamity to th^

SECOND SPECOH OF MR. CLAY,
OP  KTNTOCKy,
In &*e ialt   Ai %u M9  lS-tl—Oi the L\ecui ve Message cor
ta nmg the President's objections to the Bank bill
Mr Ki\f s 1 avmg concluded his remarks-
Mr   OL\y of Kentucky lose in leiomjter     I have no de
sire, '-did he to pro'ong tin  un oleaban t d s<us--ioa but Í must
say that I heaid with great surj inp and regiet the closing re

after the thorough rid llmg which the roof of the ho'se had re
reived m the break ng up of the pet bank svsters h   would
ave fled somewhere eise fcr refige  but there he still ¡standi 
solitary and alone, shivering and pehe-í by 'he pitiless storm
The Sub Trea-^? ry is repealed—the pet \mnk system  s aban
doncd—the United States Bink bill is vetoed—and now, w¡ °n
there is as complete and perfect a reunion of the purse and the
Senate-
sword in the hands of the Executive as ever there was under
General Jackson ot Mr Van Buien, the Senator is for doing
nothine '   The Senator is for going home, leaving the Trea-
suiy and the counuy ia their lawless condition1   Yet no man
has heretofore  more than he bas, deplored and deprecated a
state of things so uttetly unsafe and repugnant to all just ¡ re.
cautions, indicated alike by sound theoiy and experience in
free Governments    And the Senator talks to us about apply-
ing to the wisdom of practical men, m respectto banking, and
advises fuither deliberation'   Why, I should suppose that we
aie at present in the very best situation to act upon the subject
Besiies the many painful years we have had ior delibeiation,
we have been near three months almost exclusively engrossed
with the very subject itself   We have heard all manner of
facts, statements, and arguments, in any way connected with
it    We understand, it seems to me, all we can ever learn or
comprehend, about a National Bank    And we have, at least,
some conception too of  what sou of one will   be accepta
ble at the Oiher end of the  avenue     Yet now,   with  a
vast majority of the people of tne en tne country crying out
to us for a Bank—with the pt-ople throughout the whole valley
ofthe  Mississippi rising in tbeirmajesty   and demand.ngitas
indispensable to their we I being, and pointing to then losses,
their saenhces, and their sufrtungs loi the want oisuch an m- ""
stitution—in such a state of things, we are siavely and coldly
to d by the honorable Senatoi from Virginia, that we had best
go home, leavujg t epurse and the swo dm the uncontrolled
pob'-ession of the President,  and ebovi, all things   never to
mi e a  pany Bank '   Why   sir, does he, with all his know
ledge ofthe c nflictmg opinions which prevail here, and have
preval ed, believe that we evei can make a Bank but by the
votes of one  paity who act in favor of it, in opposition  to the
votes of another party against it?  I deprecate ihis expression of
opinion from that gentleman the more, because, although ihe
h >ntn able Senator profeses'notto know the opinions of the Pre-
siden t,it rertait ly (loes turnout in the sequel that there is a most
remarkable coincidence between those opinions and his own,
and he has , on tf e piesentoccasion, defended the motives and
the course ofthe President w \\\ all tne =0iKitude and all ihe fei
v^nt zeal ofa m°robei Mh - Pi ivy Council   [\ hngh ] There
is d rumor a. m>a i that a c ih"l exists—a i ew ^or' cf lutchi n Ca-
binet—whose obj( ct is the dissolution of 'ncregulai Cabinet—

session—an 1 a total change, m fact, in the \ hole fate of our
pilmca1 ifTiirs     I loje, and Ippisuade myse'f, that the ho-
norable Senator is not, cannot be, one of the con porient mem 
bers oi such a cabal, but 1 mn-- -*av that there has oeen di^plaj
ed by the homrible Senator to day a pitdispoBition, asunusn
ms and in xphc able to misconceive almost all ol what 1 have
said, and a perseveiance, af^er lepeatedconecuons, m misun-
dei tamling—for I will   not chaige him with wd ully and in
tenuonally mi-sicpipsentmg—the whole ^m andcbaracterof
the addiess which, as a man of honor and as a Senator, I felt
myself bound in duty to make to tnisbody
