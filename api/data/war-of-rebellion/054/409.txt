move forward, but I can get forage here, and I occupy the position your ordered me to. I have sent scout out on the Plains road, and will order another on the Rutledge road.

HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY CORPS,Near Junction R. and S. Roads, December 6, 1863-4.30 p.m.

MAJOR:Yours of 1.30 p.m. is at hand. The enemy fell back from his position on Rutledge road, and I have ordered scout out upon that road, which has not reported. The scout on the Strawberry Plains road reported when 4 miles out ad within 1 mile of the Plains. The reports was that the rear guard left there at 9 a.m., but that the main force of the enemy had gone on the road north of that.

I suppose the officer of the scout means the Rutledge road. We have captured between 50 and 70 prisoners since we left, and also 13 horses and mules. If the weather should change and become bad we would doubtless get several hundred of the enemy.

I will be upon the alert, and will not leave anything undone that the command can do to annoy and injure the enemy to the greatest possible extent.

I am, major, yours, truly,

SHACKELFORD,

Brigadier-General.
