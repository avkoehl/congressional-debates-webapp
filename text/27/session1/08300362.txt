tional statesman will be stripped of his laurels I need not
say to whom I allude When I declare that I adopt his theory
of the Constitution, you have the assurance th it I am unwilling
to see his honors, won in such a field, tarni* Vd
Withm my short experunceof public afjmsl have not wit
nes3ed so dangerous an innovation upon tie narnxmy of our
Federal sys em as the one proposed The General Government
enlaigtng the circle of its power by burrowing from the totateg
in amarner unknown to the Constitution' Prom the S a earn
their corporate capacity, and from such of them only as may
grant the boon' Setting up Us authouty over one h ilf oí the
Union, and acknowledging its impotence in the other hall'
This is an appeal to the authority of the States in a matter
wheie they nave no jurisdiction, and then absent does not even
give color to our right ofoccupancy of their territory by Fede-
ral machineiy Ifitweteso where are the gímanteos of the
Constitution, and wh re the limits oí < ur power? Is the absent
ing State the only ona that is mteiested m the exercise of such
a power? Evety confederate State has a right to demand that
C ingress shall not trarscend its poweis with n the limits of any
other State The harmony an 1 perfection of our system is
found in the stability of our Constitution, and in the derivation
of everv power duectly from us au homy
[Mr Preston, m his place, heie susrsrested ti " deposite act of
1836 as a piecedent where the assent of the States was re
quired ]
That was a contract with the States, in the nature of a arant
Other contracts have been made with particnlar States for
the r benefit, or for the mutual benefit of both Governments

is not, in oui view m«Vlen&ible thrft it should po=is ss the
branc imsr powerunrestneted We ate sm fictf that t i^t unre
stneted power should remain, where we respectfully think the
Constitution has placed it, in Congress, and that Congress should
fnrbeai to invent the Bank with he right to exercise it
To the opposite opinion, held by our friend-, we aie dig.
poaed so fai to concede a& to admit that the Bank bhall not be
allowed, in the fiist instance, to establish an office of discount
and deposite in any State, without the previous a«sent of Ha
Legislature But, then, we think it but right and reasonable
to require that the State should signify Us pleasure m some
specified time, ind m some practicable mode Accordingly,
the amendment, which recognises the nsht of the State to pre
vent the intioduction of a branch within It, a=ks that this right
should be exeru&ed at sometime during the period of the fi>st
session of the Lt "islatme aftei the passage of this act, and re
quires that its dissent, if it be opposed {otne introduction of the
branch, should be announced in unequivocal and unconditional
termg I& itunjubtoi improper, when conceding to the State
sach a power, the amendment requires that it should be exer
cised within a íeasonable time* Without such a limitation, the
ques ion of the establishment of branches within the States
might be an agitating qutsMon during the whoie period of the
twenty years of the existence of the charter With it, the ques
t on must be definitively settled in less than a vear fiom this
time Is it not a great and sufficient concession from those who
do no., think that any assent of the Mates is necessary, to admit
thatevery one of the twenty six Slates may prevent the intro
duUion of a branch wuhm it upon two conditions l«t That
they dissent, and, 2dly, dissent during the period of the first
session of their íespective Legislatures? Will any one say that
the question should íemain an open and disturbing quest run for
the long space of twenty year=,i Is it at all unreasonable tore
quire that it should be settled within the period—which varies
from twoto six months—ol the first session of the I egislatuie?
It nidv be objected that the amendment presumes assent if the
Legislature ren am silent, or does not assent unconditionally, or
dissenf But s it unusual to infer assent from sib rice? Is it
unreasonable to suppose that, if a State cannot bung itself to
dissent to the introduction of a branch, the introduction
of a hianch withm its limits cannot be any very calamitous
event*
According to the amendment, there are four cases m which
offices of discount and deposite may be established 1st
Where a Legislatuie, who«e cu zens ha^e sub cnbtd 2 000
■'hi i e*>, req uire one ¿d W bei e any State agents 3d
Wheie the first session of the Teg.tature afier the passage of
tins act, siall hive expired with mt us declaring uncondition
ally its assent or its dissent And 4th In any tetate whatever,
whether it has dis enttd oi not wi hin whose limits it may
be npce^saiy and proper to establish a bianch, to carry into
effect any of the powers granted by the Constitution, and
C ingress shiil require n to be e^sblidied It may be said
that this fouuh case a^eits thp power, and teco^n ves the riaht
m Congre  to (stabhsh bi inches whenevei it things propei
to accomplish the furpose of any of the grtnted poweis of
the Constitution, and so it doe , but it a^gLits die power in
the lai guige of the Constitution If the Corsti ution has
glinted (he power, it a «Pits the powei, if rt has deried the
pnver it does not assert the powei We think it has gran ed
the power md in u in  itslingtnce, we mem diMiicdy to
a «ei t the power But those who do not think it irrints the
po vei, may, nevertheless well const nt to the n*e oí the Ian
