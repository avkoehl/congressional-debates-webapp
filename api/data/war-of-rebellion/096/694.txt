hour. Says it is reported that part of the artillery has been taken away, commencing night before last, and repeats the previous statements that cotton, tobacco, and other property were being packed up in Petersburg, but that none had been moved up to yesterday p. m. when he was in town.

Major-General WEBB:

A staff officer just returned from inspection of picket-line reports no change in enemy's pickets, except an appearance of a stronger line than heretofore. The enemy's main line cannot be seen, owing to the fog.

Major-General WRIGHT:

The above is sent for your information. Do you really think the picket is strengthened?

ALEX. S. WEBB,

Brevet Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS SIXTH ARMY CORPS,February 25, 1865. (Received 6.15 p. m.)

Major-General WEBB:

I don't attach much importance to the report that the enemy's picket is strengthened; it came from one of the officers of the day, while others saw no change. The officer sent from here could not see distinctly, owing to the fog. Intercourse with enemy's picket was held once to-day, and the statement of no change in their forces was made. Have just learned that enemy have been watchful of intercourse to-day, and that one of our men who went beyond the line for wood wa shot through the hat. This looks like an attempt to conceal some movement, though it may be only an endeavor to break up the too free intercourse of the pickets and to prevent desertions.

H. G. WRIGHT,

Major-General, Commanding.
