HDQRS. CAVALRY, FOURTH DIVISION, 23rd ARMY CORPS, On Road Between Blountsville and Bristol, October 16, 1863.

Lieutenant-Colonel RICHMOND:

I have received the general's dispatches of yesterday. The enemy has fallen back to Glade Springs of Saltville. We burned fie bridges and destroyed over one-half mile of railroad track above Bristol. We burned twenty-eight box-cars, two passenger-cars, three locomotives, six gravel-cars, and destroyed the track at Bristol. We also destroyed a part of the road below the town. I will report again to-morrow morning.

J. M. SHACKELFORD,Brigadier-General.

PHILADELPHIA, October 16, 1863.

General BURNSIDE:

In addition to the prisoners taken yesterday, Colonel Adams recaptured 9 of our men belonging to the First and Fifth Tennessee regiments that were captured close to Kingston [in the] morning. He reports part of two rebel regiments at Decatur. He learns nothing reliable in regard to a force in that vicinity. In the charge yesterday a number of men lost their horses. May I be permitted to turn over to Colonel Adams the captured horses to be distributed among the men of his regiment according to his judgment? Scouts in from roads bringing no news of importance.

WOLFORD,

Colonel.
