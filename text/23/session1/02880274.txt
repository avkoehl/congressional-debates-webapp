274                                  THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.                         March 28,
I have not undertaken to discuss—aie of great
moment, and deserving of most serious considera-
tion, and will without doubt receive that considei a-
tioti when properly presented to this House And
1 certainly have no wish to screen the President
of the United Slates from an investigation of any
act of his political life, nor do I wish that the con-
duct of the Secretary bfthe Treasury, nor of any
other officer of Government, should escape the
strictest scrutiny But I do protest against this
indiscreet mode of trial I contend that every
measure should rest on its own merits, that the
several questions are of sufficient impor anee to
require "separate discussion, and that the combina-
tion of those important questions only leads to
obscure the truth, and mislead the public mind
But, sir, it is said that the gieat and important
question now to be discussed and settled is, whether
tlie reasons assigned by theSecietary of the Treas
uryfor the removal of the deposites are sufficient,
and to ascertain the opinion of Congiess upon
this point, is the ostensible ob)ect of the pioposed
amendment of the gentleman from Georgia, [Mr
Wilde,] and also of the proposed amendment of
the gentleman from Rhode Island, [Mr Burges,j
and early m this session it was the ostensible oh
]ect of the gentleman from South Carolina, [Mr
McDuFriE,] in an amendment then proposed Ly
him
With due deference foi the opinions of other
gentlemen on this flooi, and notwithstanding the
factitious, importance which has been thiown about
this viewof thesulject, I mustbepeimitted to say
that, in my opinion, the decision of that question
would be unimpoi taut, except for us political effect,
and it would have no necessary influence upon the
real question now under discussion
The Secretaiy of the Tieasury is not upon his
trial, it is not a question between Congiess and
theSecietaiy, not should it be aquestion between
Congiebs and the bank
. It is in fact a question between Confiesa and
the people We find the count-y and the public
tiea&ure in a certain condition, and we aie brund
to make such disposition of them as shall appear
to us most conducive to the public welfare, and
be-,t calculated to piomote then piesentand future
happiness and prospenty
I have said that the decision of the question of
the suflicitnoy of the reasons assigned by the
Secretin y of the Tieasury for the removal of the
deposites would be unimportant, and that it would
have no necessary beaung o influence upon the
real question under discussion
In older to test thecorrettness of this assertion, |
let us suppose, for the s ,ke of the argument, that j
we shall determine lho«e reasons to be insufficient  |
what is the result'   I beg gentlemen to recol'ect
the íeal question—and I ask again, wnat would
be the effect of the decision >
It might, indeed, show tl it we were of opinion
that the Secretary had acted without sufficient
reasons,—01 it might show that,moui opinion, he
had acted conupdy or illegally    But it wot> d not i
necessarily show euhtr ot those results     Tor it
might show only that m oui opinion he had offered
insufficient leasons foi an act which was right I
and pioper in itself, and for which good and suffi-
cient reasons existed, and Í presume it will not
be contended that the deposites should beiestored
to the United States Bank, me-e'y because the '
Secretary of the Tieasuiy may not have assigned
sufficient reasons foi then remrval, when, in point
of fact, sufficient reisons did exist                            ,
But the decision of the q lest on against the suffi 1
Clency of the reasons asatgritd by the Secrctai y of ¡
the Treasury, would furnish us with no guide to
dueet us m the true couise now to be pursued It
would Ky the basis of no legislative action Foi
sure y it does not fol'ow, as a necessat y conse-
quence, that because it may have been inexpedient
then to renové the deposites, that it must now be
expedient to restoie them The two proposmoi s
are dista ct, and depend upon entirely difierent
reasons
But, Ml Speaker, let ns suppose, on the other
hand, that by the vote of this House we shallde
cid e that the reasons assigned by the Seci et iry are
sufficient, ard that he ups whollyjustifkd by them
in miking the -emoval what then? Would that
decision furnish a tiue guide for our conduct, or
form the basis of any ¡eg.slative action at this time5
Certainly not, to my mind For although his
reasons may have been sufficient at that time, and
although the situation of the country may then hav e
demanded the immediate removal of the deposites
from the United States Bank, yet circumstances
may have lendered it expedient that those depos-
ites should now be restored Byway of illustra-
tion , I would remark, that if I were now convinced
that the United States Bank would be rechartered
in 1&36, or atany pnoi peuod, I would,without
hesitation, now vote for the íestoration of the
deposites, although I am entirely satisfied with the
reasons for their removal
1 make these remaiks, Mr Speaker, to show
that, by expressing our opinion, and deciding
upon the sufficiency of the^reasons of the Secre-
tary of the Tieasury for the'removal of'he depos-
ites, we really do not advance one step, and no
important conclusion can fairly be drawn ü.om the
decision
Although it may not be considered strictly in
order, upon the discussion of the proposed amend-
ment, to inquire into the causes of the distress
which now prevails, yet as that sul ,ect has been
made the topic of debate upon this occasion, I
must ask the indulgence of the House for a few
minutes to explain my views upon this point
It is certainly true that the Bank of the United
States, during the period between the month of
May, 1830,and the month of May, 1832, inci eased
their loans moie than twenty seven millions of
dolíais I will not inquire into the motives of the
bank, in thus extending then business But one
of two conclusions must evidently flow from tne
fact either lhat the bank, before that time, had
not issued as much paper as the country required
for its healthful use or upon that occasion, that
they issued more The first of these conclusions
cannot be adopted without chaiging the directors
of the bank with wsntof discernment to discovei,
or inclination to piomote, the interests of their
stockholdeis, winch will not be pretended And
recent events have nade most manifest the truth
of the lattei conclusion
It is also true, that between the month of May,
1832, and the meeting of this Congiess in Decem-
ber last, the bank had íeduced their loans about
sixteen millions of dollars, and since that time they
have continued to reduce
It i? not impoitant, according to my view of the
case, here to mqune whethei they h we made that
leductu n of their loans bona fide, to close their
own cone ei n«, oí , mala fide, to close the concerns
of other people But it must be obvious to eveiy
mind, that the necessary consequence of such a
íapid expansion and contiaction must be to pro-
duce a «caruly of money, and consequent custi ess I
in all blanches of Lusmess And what in fact has
been the situation of the country in the meantime?
Wl y, sn, dunng the time of the expansion, of
course money was ) lenty, and all kinds of busi-
ness piosperous and flounshing But as soon as
the contraction commenced, a íeaction also com
menced,ai d a piessure was soon felt in the money
maiket, vl ich continued to increase regularly, but
not rapidly, unt 1 the meeting cf Congress, s nee
winch time it has maiched with mostrapid strides,
and fiom pressure it soon became high pressuTe
A panic ensued, which brought distress and rum
in Us train
Su-h ¡s a brief hismry of the rise and progress
of this pressure And now, sn, let us mqune
more pirhcularly 'nto the cause oi its extraotdi-
naiy chaiacter
It is not pretended, by any one, tint the mere
act of changing the place of deposite could Ijave
produced the íesult But it is said that it is tile
gieat bieach of national faith, and of cbaiteied
lights, and viohted laws and Constitution, occa
sioned by that act, which has destroyed ill confi
denee between man and man, and brou h' panic
and distress among tl e peop'e                 °
If that has been the true cause, the eFect—aO far
as that efiect could have Leen pioduced by want of
corfidence or panic— would have been felt t once
n its gieatest foice The people would not have
v a ted Mxty days foi the meeting of Congress to
inform them that tl eierad b en agieat breach of
natonal faith, and of chartered rights, and that
their Constitution and lavs had been tnmpled
upon, and that it was time for them to be alarmed
But so fai from that, sir, we f-nd tint Jur n<* th 
interval between the removing of the deposites and
the meeting of Congress, business was going on
as usual, no loss of confidence, no panic,and under
no other pressure mthe money market than would
necessanly have resulted trom the situation of the
country if the deposites had not been i emov ed I
say, therefore, that it is not tiue that the piesent
distress m the community has been occasioned by
the íemoval of the public deposites. The cause
was not adequate to the effect
But, sir, that distress is occasioned by the strug-
gle of the United States Bank for a reoharter, com-
bined with the stiuggle of aspiung politicians for
power, acting upon the people by means of the
mflammatoiy and panic-making speeches of hon-
orable members of Congress—speeches which are
multinhed by means of th e pu ulic pi esses, and scat-
teiedgiatuitous!ybyhundredsofthousands,amidst
a people who were placed in a situation easily
to be alarmed and distressed by the impioviuent
designing conduct of the bank itself Heie, sir,
are causes enough for the effect- causes which
would have existed in full foice if the. deposites
had never been removed And the only d fference
is, that they now charge the disti ess to the removal
of the deposites, and if they had not been removed,
they would have charged it, with the same effect
to the veto
Mi Speaker, in reflecting upon the presen t situ-
ation of the countiy, 1 was foicibly struck with
the íemarks of the honorable gentleman fiom
Rhode Island, [Mr Burgls,] some days ago,
when addiessmg the House upon this subject
He represented the Government bank directors aa
becoming drunk by looking at the immense masses
of gold and silvei m the vaults of the bank The
idea selves as an apt illustration of my view s, and
I shall therefore take the liberty of using the gen-
tleman's figure, and extending its applicaiion, by
comparing the people of the United States to
diunken men Yes, sir, for six years past we
have been too much excited,.we have taken too
muchstimulous, too much wine for our substantial
food Some three yeais ago the Bank of the
United States (whom I shall consider upon this
occasion as the wine dealer) administered most
copious draughts of the intoxicating liquor We
were told that it was good wine, and would pass
current evei y where We seized it witn avidity,
and drank it with delight It gave us aduitionul
stiength, vigoi, and animation Web camediur k
with prosperity But, sn, it is wuh bodies poli-
tic, in this íespect, as with na'ural persons—an
over excitement cannot continue foi a long time
A conespo iding depiession must ensue, and we
are now in that condition The wine merchant has
ceased to supply our appetites with their wonted
quantity, and ¡eft us feeble, and tremulous, and
distressed And shall we, sir, igam i etui n to the
dangerous practice, and for the sake of a fe v
i br ght and joyous years of excess and intoxicating
prospenty, condemn ourselves to a mematuie old
I age,anddragoutamiseiable,decrepid,fnd gouty
| existence, depenaent upon the wine d°a!er for our
I lazy comtorts, and leave to oui posteuty, n stesd
of the bught inheritance which we íeceived from
our ancestor-, an inheritance encumbered f t
more than it is worth ? A moneyed aristocracy ?
No, sir, we h„ve yet sufficient physical power to
' redeem ourselves Let us rise in our s rength,
and shake offthe drowsy and sicl ly feelme, which
is the resuit of excess, and by one spmted and
mvrdy exertion, restoie ouiselves to health, and
pros] enty, and happiness
I have sai 1 that tfe present questnn is a jues-
t on of the lechaiter of the Bank of tl e United
Stites By this 1 neun, that it is not only the
question now tecln cally before the House, but
that it is the real question befoie the people.—the
qu stio l which we fie talleiupon mo¡>t uigently
to decide And let me say, sn, it ¡s a question,
tne deci ion of which u\\\ do more to restore con-
fidence aid relieve the present disti ess than the
decision of pny other question which can be pro-
posed to Congress at this time It is indeed a
momentous qtestion, up n which the g-eatest
talents of the countiy have been exerc sed I do
not intend to discuss it in making up my mind
upon this subject, I have rot found it necessary to
resoitto the much vexed question of the constitu-
tionality of the measuie, nor to the aiguments de-
duced from the abuse of powei in conducting the
