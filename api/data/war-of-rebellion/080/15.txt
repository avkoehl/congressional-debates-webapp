than I was led to suppose by the verbal report first received. General Sheridan says he thinks 225 killed, wounded, and missing will cover it, while he thinks the enemy's killed and wounded is much greater. This is Gregg's loss between the Chickahominy and James Rivers, not counting losses in previous engagements. Nothing heard from Wilson since he left Burkeville. If it is possible I wish paymasters could be sent here to pay the troops. The officers particularly are suffering.

CITY POINT, VA., June 27, 1864 - 3 p. m.

All is quiet here now except from our own guns, which fire into the bridge at Petersburg from a distance of about 2,000 yards. Petersburg papers of the 25th state that Hunter is striking for Jackson River depot, about forty miles north of Salem, and say that if he reached Covington, which they suppose he will of with most of his forces, but with loss of material, he will be safe. The same paper accuses Hunter of destroying a great amount of private property and stealing a large number of wagons, horses, and cattle. The same paper also states that Wilson destroyed a train of cars loaded with cotton and furniture, burned the depot building, &amp;c., at Burkeville, and destroyed some of the track and was still pushing south. All the railroads leading into Richmond are now destroyed are now destroyed and some of them badly.

CITY POINT, VA., July 1, 1864.

The enemy's cavalry finding that Sheridan was secure where he was crossing James River, left him and interposed themselves on the Weldon railroad between Wilson and return. Kautz, with his cavalry and a portion of Wilson's, succeeded in passing the enemy and getting in, but with the loss of his artillery and wagons. Wilson, with most of his command, was cut off, and is supposed to have gone back south. Immediately on receipt of news that Wilson was returning, General Meade sent Wright's corps to Reams' Station to aid him. Sheridan was also ordered to join him. Wright and Sheridan are both now out, and the latter with orders to push on until he learns reliably from Wilson. Our artillery is now so located that it plays easily on the bridges in Petersburg. They were hit a number of times yesterday by Smith's guns. A small steamer lying at the Petersburg wharf was also hit and burned.
