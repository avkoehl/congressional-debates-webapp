so hot a fire that the whole line gave way and victory was secured. My loss on that occasion was 1 killed, 2 mortally wounded (since died), and 11 wounded. From Waynesborough we marched on Savannah, passing to the south as far as Midway and from thence to this place, occasionally skirmishing with Colonel Hood's battalion of rebel cavalry, but without any loss. On the morning of the 13th Captain E. A. Hancock, with detachments from the brigade (120 men), marched on an expedition to Altamaha bridge, but found the enemy (two regiments of infantry and artillery) too strongly posted to attack them. He destroyed, however, several small bridges and a large trestle-work, and captured 16 of the enemy, returning to camp at Midway on the 15th.

Since this movement commenced my command has destroyed 49 cotton gins and presses, containing 731 bales of cotton, and a large amount of cotton unpinned. My men for the most part have subsisted on the country, and though it was absolutely necessary for them to be often from under the eyes of their officers in their foraging excursions, yet have I not heard of single act committed by them derogatory to their character as soldiers.

My officers have all done their duty with most commendable alacrity, and my have borne the hardships of the campaign without a murmur, rendering prompt obedience to the orders of their officers and displaying a patience and bravely truly commendable.

Herewith I forward a report of casualties and a list of articles destroyed and captured by my regiment during the expedition.

Respectfully submitted.
