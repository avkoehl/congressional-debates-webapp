2. There will be a review of this to-morrow at 12 m. The troops must be prepared to leave their camps at 10 a. m.

It is probable that the review will take place between the Cummings house and the McDowell house, and in line of battle by battalions in mass, facing north, and in the same order as now encamped. Should the weather prove unfavorable the review will not take place. This decision will not take place. This decision will be communicated through the staff officers sent to these headquarters.
