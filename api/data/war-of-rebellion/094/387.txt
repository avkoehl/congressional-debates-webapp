Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Pulaski, December 27, 1864-10 p.m.

Major General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

I have received the report of this date* of your operations in East Tennessee and Southwestern Virginia, and most cordially congratulate you and the officers and men of your command for your complete and splendid success, and for which you richly deserve, and I have earnestly recommended you receive, the thanks of the War Department. Whilst you were driving Breckinridge from East Tennessee this army gave Hood a very genteel whipping, capturing from him all of sixty-eight pieces of artillery, large numbers of small-arms, and several thousand prisoners. His army is now thoroughly demoralized and retreating as rapidly as the roads will permit across the Tennessee. General Sherman has also made a triumphant march through Georgia to Savannah, which place he captured on the 21st instant, with large quantities of stores, arms, and ammunition, and 150 locomotives. The garrison, under Hardee, made its escape by the Union Causeway toward Charleston.

GEO. H. THOMAS,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers, Commanding.

Lyon's forces are reported moving out by way of Campbellsville. Send out scouts to watch his motions. It is possible he may be driven toward Camp Nelson. Telegraph any information you can get concerning him.

By order of Brevet Major-General Burbridge:

J. BATES DICKSON,

Captain and Assistant Adjutant-General.
