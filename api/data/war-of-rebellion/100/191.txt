Lieutenant General U. S. GRANT,

City Point, Va.:

We entered Raleigh this morning. Johnston has retreated westward. * I shall move to Asheville [Ashborough] and Salilsbury or Charlotte. I hope Sheridan is coming this way with his cavalry. If I can bring Johnston to a stand I will soon fix him. The people here had not heard of the surrender of Lee, and hardly credit it. All well.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

Take up iron north of Goldsborough. Push repairs up to Gulley's and Raleigh. Road good this side of Smithfield. I will move on Asheville [Ashborough] and Salisbury and return to Raleigh.
