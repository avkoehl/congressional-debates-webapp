PALMETTO, September 19, 1864 - 4. 30 p. m.

General B. BRAGG,

Richmond:

My present position leaves the road open to Augusta, also to Macon. The enemy has a sufficient force to send a detachment of 15,000 men to either of these places, especially to the former. On account of its great importance it is important that we should be able to assemble independently of this army a sufficient force to drive back such a detachment. If the enemy should move with his main force upon Augusta or Macon this army should be left to come upon his rear. I suggest, in addition to the force the Confederate Government could collect for such an emergency, that the Governors of South Carolina and Georgia be urged to prepare for a like purpose. I shall myself appeal to them. I am pushing forward the fortifications around those two places.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
