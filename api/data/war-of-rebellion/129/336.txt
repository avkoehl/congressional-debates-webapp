an outlaw and a felon should be received and admitted to the courtesies or privileges of civilized warfare, or exempted from the liabilities of a criminal. It has held him up to the detestation of Christendom and obtained the answering award of moral condemnation from the tribunal of enlightened public sentiment everywhere. Within its limits, and wherever its power may enable it to execute justice, he has been and will be held an outlaw and a felon. To essay more would be mere brutum fulmen against the criminal, yet entail inconvenience to our own Government and injury to innocent victims of his malevolence. In this view, the Government has sought to regulate its action. It has not denied the power or position, however unworthily bestowed by his own Government on General Butler within their limits, but has refused to receive or admit him within ours. If an honest purpose of effecting exchanges, in compliance with the cartel or on equitable terms, be really entertained by the enemy, all the arrangements essential thereto may be readily attained consistently with the position thus justly held by our Government; while, if the selection was intended merely as a pretext of avoidance, or for the purpose of gratuitous offense, the hypocrisy of the one design or the malignity of the other will be exposed. Since this relation has been held some limited exchanges by indirect communication have been effected, and hopes are entertained, especially in view of the increased number of prisoners which recent successes have given us, that the inhuman policy and delusive pretenses of the enemy will be abandoned and the equitable stipulations of the cartel be again acknowledged and executed. Such consummation would tratification the whole population of the Confederacy, and bear relief and consolation to thousands of families throughout the land. For a fuller history and explanation of all the proceedings connected with the subject of exchange, reference is made and special attention invited to the accompanying report of Mr. Ould, our able commissioner of exchange. *

Since my last report the administrative operations of the respective bureaus have been conducted with ability and energy by the zealous officers in charge. They have had many difficulties to encounter from the fluctuating currency; from deficiency of supplies; from the withdrawal of workmen and imperfect means of transportation; yet despite of these and other impediments, they have, in all instances, it is believed, not only maintained, but have rather increased the efficiency and success of their varied working departments. One of their greatest embarrassments has resulted from the law of the late Congress prohibiting, under severe penalties, the employment or continuance in employment of any liable to military duty. As the operations of several of the most important bureaus required assistants as well as officers of great activity and energy, rarely to be found except in the prime of life, a large number of the most trusted and essential employees came within the prohibited classes. To dismiss them at once, without breaking up, at the most critical and important period, the operations of the essential bureaus of Subsistence, Supply, and Transportation, was plainly impossible. It became necessary, therefore, that the power of detail, which had been reposed, it is to be presumed, to guard against such, among other contingencies, should be exercised by the Department more liberally than would have been otherwise consistent with its views. Every exertion has, however,
