bia river.
It appears from the report of the committee,
which was also read, that Mr. Peale was appointed
by the Navy Department on the 28th of Decem-
ber, 1836, a member of the scientific corps to be
attached to the South Sea surveying and exploring
expedition, organized under the act of Congress of
the 18th of January, 1836. He performed con?
stant and valuable service during the expedition)
and was on board the United States ship Peacock
when she proceeded to the northwest coast of
America. On the 18th of July, 1841, that vessel
was entirely lost in endeavoring to enter the mouth
of the Columbia river, the officers and crew having
scarcely time to escape with their lives, and being
unable to save anything from the wreck. Mr.
Peale, upon this occasion, lost all his personal
eflfctsâ€”his books and instruments, and a large
number of articles which he had collected in his
department, and which it would be difficult to re-
place. But, notwithstanding the calamity, he was
enabled, by the exertions of the commanding offi-
cer, Captain Hudson, and his own strenuou^j
efforts, to replace, at extravagant prices, and as
far as practicable from his own funds, such arti-
cles as were indispensably necessary for the com-
pletion of the contemplated surveys of the coun-
try, and was thus enabled to continue his useful-
ness to the expedition; and, with others of the
scientific corps, traversed over a large portion of
Oregon and Upper California, thereby adding
much to the information of those countries which
we now possess. , -

man, with the consent of the committee.
The CHAIRMAN. Discussion can only pro-
