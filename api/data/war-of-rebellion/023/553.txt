If I can have a few days' rest for these new regiments I can do a great deal toward organizing, arming, and instructing them. It has been impossible to accomplish much in this respect since I have commanded them, they being on constant duty nearly all the time.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. GAY,

Chief of Staff.

Do as you deem best in carrying out promises to Indiana volunteers. Why is General Morgan retreating, and what force of the enemy is pursuing him? His abandonment of Cumberland Gap must be promptly inquired into and reported on.
