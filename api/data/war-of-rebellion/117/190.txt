General Dix is under my command and will meet any representative whom you may appoint at such place in this vicinity not within our lines as you may designate.

It will be necessary for you to give me thirty-six hours' notice of the time and place, that General Dix may be enabled to meet the appointment.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

GEO. B. McCLELLAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

FORT MONROE, July 13, 1862.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War:

It seems to me very important that I should have General Wool's correspondence with Generals Cobb and Huger in regard to exchange of prisoners and that I should have also some instructions from you. General Wool has taken away all papers relating to the subject, so that I have to seen a copy of the cartel between the United States and Great Britain. In the meantime I am advised this evening by General McClellan, to whom I sent a copy of your dispatch this evening by General McClellan, to whom I sent a copy of your dispatch in cipher, that he has requested General Lee to appoint a general officer to meet me and given forty-eight hours' notice. I did not expect such speedy action and must ask your instructions as to the place of exchange, &amp;c., and also General Wool's correspondence by to-morrow evening's boat from Baltimore.

JOHN A. DIX.

Major-General.

Honorable EDWIN M. STANTON, Secretary of War.

SIR: Will you have the kindness to send me a certified copy of the parole* given by Daniel C. Lowber, of New Orleans, who was released from Fort Warren, with instructions how to dispose of him. He now seems to think that he has been sent down here for the purpose of visiting his wife and is quite indignant that I do not send him home to his family.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
