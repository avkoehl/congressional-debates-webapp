HEADQUARTERS,Richmond, Va., May 27, 1862.

Major General G. HUGER,

Commanding, &amp;c., Drewry's Bluff, Va.:

GENERAL: I am directed by General Lee to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 24th*, reporting the arrival of the First Louisiana Regiment at Petersburg, &c., and to say that Major-General Holmes has been instructed to take charge of and defend the line of road through Weldon to Petersburg, and that you are desired to send a light battery to Weldon as soon as one of those now in course of preparation at Petersburg is ready for field service, to relieve that of Captain Graham, which can then repair to Petersburg to recruit and refit.

It has been reported by General Holmes this morning that eleven steamers are at Plymouth and two gunboats removing obstructions at the confluence of these facts, and that General Holmes will regulate his movements accordingly, and it is presumed he will instruct you not to remove the brigade left at Petersburg until relieved by troops from the Department of North Carolina.

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. H. TAYLOR,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
