ed members of the 25th Congress, be rescinded, and
that Messrs. Gholson and Claiborne are not duly
elected members of the 25th Congreess."
The question pending was on the following
amendment of Mr Howard
"And that Messrs Prentiss and Word are not
entitled to seats m this House as members of the
£5th Congress, and that their seats be declared va-
cated, and that the Speaker of this House inform
the Governor of Mississippi of that fact "
Mr. UNDERWOOD being entitled to the floor,
he gave way to
Mr HOWARD, who modified his amendment
as follows
" Resolved, That Samuel S Prentiss and Thomas
J. Word arc not members of the Twenty-fifth Con-
gress "
Mr H said, if that amendment should be agreed
to by the House, he should then move the follow-
ing, as an addition •
" Resolved, That the Speaker of thi  House do
communicate a copy of the above resolutions to the
Governor of the State of Mississippi "
Mr UNDERWOOD again gave way to
Mr POPE who read, and stated his intention to
submit the following amendment
" And farther resolved, That Archibald Yeli
is not entitled to a seat in this House, ps a mem-
ber of the twenty-fifth Congress, and that the seat
of the representative from the State of Arkansas
be, and the same is hereby, declared to be vacant,
and that the Speaker of this House inform the
Governor of the State of Arkansas of that fact "
The CHAIR remarked that th« proposition
being on a subject having no connection with that
under consideration, was not in older.
The question being then propounded on the
amendment of Mr Howard as modified—
Mr UNDERWOOD inquired of the Chair if the
question was not susceplib'e of division, of striking
out and inserting, as he had reason to believe the
Chair had reviewed his decision m the negative
last night.
The CHAIR stated that since the adjournment
of the House last evening, he had conferred with
the gentleman from Kentucky himself, with a
member from Massachusetts and others, and had
carefully reviewed his decision, which had been
hastily given. His opinion was based upon the
"Parliamentary Manual," but the forty-first rule
of the House laid down a different doctrine, and
by another rule of the House it was provided that
the "Manual" should be the law, where it did not
conflict with the rules. The rnle, therefore, hav-
ing the preference, the Chair accordingly now de-
cided that the question was susceptible of division
Some conversation ensued between the CHAIR
and Mr. BELL as to an incidental point of order,
but no action grew out of it
Mr UNDERWOOD then proceeded to address
the House in. opposition to Mr How ird's amend-
ment, and against sending the election back to the
people of Mississippi
Mr  CILLEY followed m reply
Mr ROBERTSON moved to strike out the word
"not," in Mr. Howard's amendment, so as to de-
clare affirmatively that Messis. Prentiss and Word
■were entitled to their seats
Mr? TILLINGHAST then spoke at length in
suppr rt of Messrs Prentiss and Word, and against
returning the election to the people
Mr MASON of Virginia gave his reasons at
length for the course he advocated some days
since, for sending the election back
Mr MENIFEE replied to Mr. Muson, and
insisted that Messrs Prentiss aim wuia were the
duly elected members
Mr. WHITE of Indiana was m favor of a refe-
rence of the case back to the people, and gave the
reasons of his opinion at length
Mr. HOWARD explained the effect of his
amendment, which was to negative the claims of
all the parties, and send the election back
Mr. WHITE moved an adjournment lost—aj es
80, noes 104.
Mr. PRENTISS replied to Messrs Mason and
White, and argued at length against the proposi-
tion of reference to the people.
The House then adjourned.
10 THE  EDITORS OP THE GLOBE
I have seen m several newspapers an account ot
the debate on Mr Calhoun's resolutions, m wh'ch
is a mistake as it regards my colleague (Mr Ai -

the right of trial by jury, to persons claimed as
fugitive slave- I have no recollection tha- Mr
Allen said any thing on that subject My le-
mark was made in reply to Mr Youisc, and his
name ought to be where Mr Allen's has been
placed by mistake This is m> recollection of the
