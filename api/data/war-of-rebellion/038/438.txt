Before Vicksburg, June 25, 1863.

The following telegram has been received at these headquarters:

McPherson will spring the mines in his front between 2 and 4 o'clock to-day, and will try to take possession of the main fort. Hold your troops in readiness to threaten an assault, to keep the enemy from marching on McPherson. As soon as you hear the explosion, open with artillery lively for about FIFTEEN minutes.

U. S. GRANT.

The general commanding Thirteenth Corps will receive a telegram about half an hour before the miners are priming, and will dispatch orderlies to each DIVISION, but when the firing begins on the right of the corps the other corps will take it up.

The trenches will be manned for an assault, and the regiments and companies not therein will be put under arms, in the best cover, for the same purpose in our front, without exposing them to fire.
