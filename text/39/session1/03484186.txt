named, respectively, personally, or in caso of their

During tho reading of the substitute,
Mr. STEVENS said: May I ask whether
thai is not the award of the War Department
commission ?
Mr. DELANO. So far as it concerns the
award for the capture of Jefferson Davis; the
substitute is as reported from the Committee
of Claims. It is just as reported by Judge
Advocate General Holt. In reference to the
awards for the arrest of Atzerodt, they are
precisely as reported by Judge Holt. The
changes in the bill from the Committee of
Claims are in reference to the arrest of Booth
and Herold.
The reading of the substitute was then con-
cluded.
Mr. DRIGGS. I ask to offer an amendment
to the amendment.
Mr. IIOTCHKJSS. I am willing to let the
amendment be submitted.

Mr. DRIGGS. I do not want to see two or
three men have $40,000 of tho reward. At the
suggestion of the gentleman from Pennsylva-
nia I have added provisions for the two colored
women, Jackson and Griffin. This man Baker
is building a big hotel in my State with the
money he has made off the Government, and
yet it is proposed to pay him $17,500!
Mr. HOTCHKISS. Mr. Speaker, before the
various amendments aro discussed I will ex-
plain my position to the House in reporting
the pending measure. The question of the
distribution of these awards was referred to
various committees in this House, and it was
bandied about from committee to committee
without action. It finally fell into the hands
of the Committee of Claims. They were di-
rected to make an investigation and to report-
to the House in what manner the rewards
should be distributed. The duty was then de-
volved upon me by the committee. I have
heard all the evidence in relation to the sev-
eral awards, all that I have been able to pro-
cure from tho War Department and elsewhere,
and presented this report to the committee. I
supposed it was satisfactory to the committ ee.
I had no idea any member had any objection
to it or any part of it. . If I had I should not
have reported it. It ir, a matter in which I
have no personal feeling. It is merely my
judgment from the investigation I have made
of the evidence. It is news to mc that any
member here objected to it. I do not wish to
be forccd to have an issue between myself and
the commission that reported this matter to
the House, and which was unacceptable to the
House. I do not wish to have an issue forced
on me and be compelled to discuss it here. I
am told thatthe previous question will be voted
down in case that it is called now, and mem-
bers advise me not to press it. I am at a loss
to know what my duty in the premises is.
Several Members. Call it now.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. In deference to many
members of the House, I will now demand the
previous question.
The previous question was seconded and the
main question ordered.
The SPEAKEll stated the first question to
be on the amendment offered by Mr. Dbiggs,
which was the award of the War Department.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. I understand the ques-
tion now is on *the amendment which looks
mainly to the award for the capture of Booth
and Herold.
A Member. That is all.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. Mr. Speaker, I am sur-
prised at a remark made by the gentleman
trom Michigan [Mr. Driggs] when he offered
his amendment, that General Baker was now
building a hotel somewhere.
Mr. DRIGGS. Well, that is so. [Laughter.]
Mr. HOTCHKISS. The gentleman says that
is so. Then, that is the length and breadth, I
suppose, of his argument. Has the gentleman
taken any testimony in this case to determine
who is entitled to the reward for the apprehen-
sion of Booth and Herold? Does he know
anything about the case? And are the cir-
cumstances, business, or private character of
General Baker an element in this case?
Mr. STEVENS. Allow me to say that the
evidence before the War Department shows
that Baker did not know anything about it.
Mr. HOTCHKISS. The evidence before
the War Department, begging the gentleman's
pardon, gives the entire credit to General Ba-
ker for having planned, originated, and exe-
cuted this enterprise and I say, as a lawyer,
that if you take the evidence set forth in the
report of the commission of the War Depart-
ment, take the reward offered and the terms
of it, it will give every cent of it to General
Baker. The report of the commission says:
" The expedition which resulted in this arrest was
orignated, planned, and generally directed by Colo-
nel L. C. Baker, who, though not accompanying it,
is regarded as having occupied the position of supe-
rior and commanding olkccr of those by whom it was
immediately conducted. He is therefore deemed to
be entitled to the same share of the reward which,
under the statutory rule referred to, would be pay-
able to the commander of a squadron, by a separate
ship of which a prize had been taken, to wit: one-
twentieth of the whole amount to bo distributed, or,
in this instance, Â§3,750."
Wherein the report before the House differs
from the report of the commission is not in the
service performed, but the principle upon which
the reward is distributed. The report before the
House is that it should be distributed upon the
ground of service actually performed and of
merit in this particular case, and not with ref-
erence to the rule governing a seizure in a prize
case. I will read further from the report of
the commission:
" The services of Messrs. Conger and Baker upon
this expedition were, no doubt, of great value; and,
inasmuch as these parties immediately represented
the views and intentions of Colonel Baker, tlieir part
in carrying out the original plan was particularly
important."
These are the persons to whom the War De-
partment give the credit of having performed
the service; and they say, in short, that they
shall not be paid for it, but somebody else shall.
If it were a prize case the laiv in prize cases
would not give tliein the reward. Now, this
