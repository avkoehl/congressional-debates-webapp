APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE-

26th Cong.......2nd Sess.
Treasury Note Bill—Mr. Duncan.
H. of Reps.
How, I B¡,£ again, wee thefearl ssand honeat
expose of prirciples, on the part of the Democracy,
met? W'iy, sir, by onmhn orgies, that would
have dtsgiaced a bicchar alian fea«t—by empty un-
meaning pageants—ridiculous displays of log cab
ins, be«et in coon skms, fox tails, oU goards, empty
barrels, shot pouches, and snapping turtle*, and
by other displays unworthy of the ag , disgrace-
ful to any people, and an insult to every under-
standing of morality and decency. Or, m the lan-
guage ot my poet

It lb di-igractful to the Am Mean intelligence to
say tint the elections «e'e earned by sucn dis-
plays, in the entire absence of avowe I principles
We mutt look for some other influence, by w 1 ca
the whole power and ferce of the American De-
mocracy havp been overthrown There was a
combina ion of circumstarces and fac ions brought
together, and made to bear on the Adrian tra ion,
which never has been befoie and it i^ hop d
never will be again r rst of the factions Those fac-
tions were bound together b/ no principle or tie,
save their hostility to the Democratic pary, and
to Democratic principies Tne Abol t onist and
the Slav hold?r, the bank man and the anti bank
man—the high tdrifBie, and the ann-lanffi e—
the di=tnbu lornst, and the, anti-ir-tnbutio'nst—
the assumptions, and the aid- s umptiom-d,
though all aniip d s to each otn r, were
timed against lh^ Demociacy, all rallied umer
their difli lent bannw; to the saniard of Fcde
rahsm. Change1 change1 was th"ir watchword
The cry and the eel o ol chinge never was p-r-

with upivaid  of nine hu^ Ircd mcorporaied bank-
ing institutions, a large portion ot whose capital
was and is owned by cipital st-- in London, Paris
and Amsterdjm
Before I take my «-eat, I wi 1 explain the p ocessby
wnich all ou-pccimary and commercial embarrass-
ments v ere brought i ponu-. by th,>text<'nd'"deie'it,
banking an 1 mtea al imorovement svs em, but it is
at this moment my obj ct to expo e the cucum
stance* an 1 influences which \teie h>-ou?hi to bear
upon th  recent e'cctions It ia we 1 known th^t
this Admin str ton and the D"in c a*ic party
weie, and are nov, oppose! t" thecontric i"g of
further fore jn loans, and to lh= privileges which
the present system of balking be'tows upon ¡ho e
instiintjt us and their stoekh dcrs It is we I'mov i
that State stocks in the European markets iipve
been gndually falling s n e the revulsion and
bank commercial suspension  in 1837, until
they are net woith rao e than sixty or sixty-five
cents on the dollar it is also well known that one
of  the   means   by which those stocks would be
raised to pir \al e, would be by ge'img the Gene-
ral Gnernment to assume the State deots It ¡s
well known, too, that this Administration was op
pose i to tí at policy The restrictions and secu-
rities which the Administration and its supporters
were imposing upon the bank*, dismajed bank
stockholders, both at hom^ and abroad. Thi y saw
in the re election of Mr Van Baren and hi? sup-
porters the overthrow of their swindling system, and
the downfall of their corrupt ms itutions.
It was to avoid a catastrophe so fatal to the gam-
bling and stockjobbing interests, that united the
bankers and stockholders of both Europe and this
cjuntrv agam«t the re election of the present Ad
ministration and rullied all th" powerand influence
v h ch a control of two hundred millnns of State
debts, twice tb.it anount of bank capital, and per-
haps f< ur times tnat amount of bank loans gave
them over the people Tne idea that British capi-
tal, British gold, and E-ittsh influeice, controlled
the recent electi irs, is scouted b> the Federal party
here, and denounced as a slander upon the freemen
ot this country Sir, it is honorable to suppose
tiie American p ople incapable of briDery or be ng
bribed It is not charged that they were bribed di-
rectly, nor was it ne< e^sary that they should be
There we e eas er and cheaper methods of bring n 
British lnflu nee and British capital to operate upon
the people and the elections That such influence
were brought to bear, no one having a regard for
truth, and acqua nted with the facts, will deny I
hold in my hand the evidence—evidence cmclu
sive—evidence which carries convict on with it
It is well known that Daniel Webster went to
England It has been publicly pnd pnvately re-
ported, and I beltev" never contra he'ed, tnat he a ent
upon me-ins to the im unt of n°ar (r ah >ut sixt)

If sas to rt, lore cwndence in the abili y and faith

thtt more loans might be obtained, and to assure
the stockholders thit the States were consti utionilly
and ligillj bound to liquidate their bonds A kind
of notirn n>as prevailing that the Sta es hid no

So we have had British bank an 1 «¡tockjohbins
a°ints to superintend our Legislatures, and in order
that th- Legislatures should be of the proper cast,
such as would be more hk ly to carry out the views
of the stockjobbing herd, it is fair to presume that
these agents were wire workers in the elections.
What American will not feel humbled when he
reflects tha' oar legts'attve halls are beset with Bri-
tish agents, demanding legis'ation in behalf of fo-
reign interests This is the influence which sprung
th  question of Federal assumption of State debts,
and it seems, while the people of the United States,
or all except the Federal fugle masters, were kept
in perfect ignorance of General Harrison's views
of the great questions of public interest, the stock-
jobbers and e wners understood bim well
Here is an extract from a London paper
' The T ondon Morning Post, of June 3d m speaking of a re
port ol Mr Kendall and several other membeis of the Amen
can Cabinet had íesigned, says
By the election of General Harrison the Whig candidate,
and the rejection of Mr Van Buren the return of the Govern
merit to a sound and rational system of banking will follow as
a matter of cour e and possibiy the United States Bank may
once inore fin t itself under the pr itection of a proper charter
The lejec ion of Mi Van Buren will be decisive of the fate of
thetetb Tieasmy scheme That insane piece of legislation will
V mostassme liyk locked on the head, and we shall no longer

winch it is associated
