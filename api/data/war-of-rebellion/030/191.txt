We have advices from Hartsville and up the river, and no cavalry said to be nearer than the gap. It is only small guerrilla parties hovering round Cave City. They can be destroyed or driven away by combined movement from Columbia, Bowling Green, and Munfordville. Sufficient guards of convalescents should hereafter accompany trains up and down, armed, with three days' rations. Please arrange this.

By order of Major-General Rosecrans:

J. P. GARESCHE,

Assistant Adjutant-General and Chief of Staff.
