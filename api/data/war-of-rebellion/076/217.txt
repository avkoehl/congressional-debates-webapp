The enemy's skirmish line was found running along the toll and. After remaining on the road some two hours. General Morgan's skirmishers were driven in and to the Peach Tree Creek by a force estimated at three regiments. These troops came from the enemy's works over the railroad near the river.

Received since my return to quarters and forwarded.

This report confirms the impression I entertain my line is safe to the road to Atlanta. I have just had a conversation with "Tippen," who says the rebel guns were fired from the high hill which overlooks Atlanta.
