THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
January 8,
ally aware that such an answer as Hunt or
any other honest member of the nominating
convention would be compelled to make to
such a question, would establish the general
concurrence that the success of the sitting
member could only be achieved against me by
exactly reversing the unshaken judicial rule
for construing statutes of the nature of the
Missouri registration law; and that to thus
show that such was the mutual and concurrent
''purpose" with which the supporters of the
contestee returned from their convention,
would but naturally explain and illustrate, to
the degree of indignant and general vitiation,
a registration which was as illegal in "pur-
pose' ' as it was utterly shameless in practice.
Without feeling it permissible in this con-
nection to direct your attention to the deposi-
tions from other counties, as to what I was
prevented from proving by the "sustained"
objections of the contestee's attorney, I but
refer, at page 17, to the deposition of Bassett,
another of his leading supporters in my own
county, as corroborating that of his conven-
tional one, and will no longer restrain myself
from the legal "connection" sometime since
alluded to, and which will be a substantial
resume of the "brief" from which I have so j
long, but I trust rather illustratively, digressed.
That the oath in contest here, especially in
the official construction which was everywhere
given to it by the officers of registration, was
more restrictive of the elective franchise than
was authorized by the organic or enabling act
of the Legislature, which was simply to "pro-
ceed to the duties assigned to them under that
act," or, in other words, as to the question
here, to "consider of such amendments to the
constitution of the State as may be by them
deemed necessary " "to preserve in purity the
elective franchise to loyal citizens," will be
judicially apparent by reference to the second
paragraph of the opinion and decision which
was rendered by the Supreme Court of the
United States at its last term, wherein John
A. Cummings was plaintiff in error and the
State of Missouri defendant in error, namely:
" The oath prescribed by the constitution, divided
into its separable parts, embraces more than thirty
distinct affirmations ortests. Some of the acts against
which it is directed constitute offenses of the highest
grade, to which, upon conviction, heavy penalties are
attached. Some of the acts have never been classed
as offenses in the law3 of any State, and some of the
acts, under many circumstances, would not be even
blameworthy."
May it not be unhesitatingly submitted that
a convention which had no authority conferred
upon it in respect to the elective franchise,
except, at the farthest, such a restriction of it
as should preserve it "in purity to loyal citi-
zens," was but necessarily without authority
to disfranchise a class of men which all the
testimony has shown, and will continue to
show, were themselves "loyal citizens," and
whose alleged "sympathies" or "acts," it has
been seen, and will continue to be shown by
the testimony, were "not even blameworthy?"
And could such a construction as was given
to the clauses of the oath in contest by the
registering officers of the district, who are
proven to have been the friends and supporters
of the contestee, have been in any respect
legalized by an election in which those citizens
were not allowed to participate? Or, if legal-
ized at all, as it may be argued it should be,
for the sake of the public tranquillity, may it
not be additionally and undoubtingly submit-
ted, that the only permissible construction of
"the said oath" is fixed, not merely by an
unvarying current of judicial decisions, which
lean to the side of the "people" who were,
voters on one day and menaced with disfran-
chisement the next day, but by the unyielding
terms of the fifth section of the organic act
itself; and that no construction was permis-
sible which transcended the object or purpose
to which (in this respect) the convention was
restricted, namely, "such amendments to the
constitution of the State as may be by them
deemed necessary" "to preserve in purity
the elective franchise to loyal citizens ?''
Who were "loyal citizens," who "the peo-
ple," at the date and by the recognition of
that organic act? Were those who had mis-
taken their "paramount allegiance," as Pal-
mer and "thousands of others" did, but who
condoned their error and placed themselves in
true allegiance, under the ordinance and the
amnesty (State and Federal) of 1862, any less
entitled to voting citizenship than other citi-
zens were? And having been recognized as
citizens and voters by the organic act upon
which they were called to vote in 1864, and
which was to give to the convention, if called,
all the authority it would possess in respect to
the elective franchise, could such citizens and
voters be disfranchised, as the contestee as-
sumes they have been, unless they were out-
voted at an election in which they, too, were
allowed to participate? It would seem that
where the very gist of their complaint is that
they gave the convention no authority to dis-
franchise them, without at least a proper sub-
sequent ratification, all such questions as the
foregoing must be necessarily answered in the
negative; and that if so, it at least decides
and enstamps the "construction" which the
oath in question should have received, instead
of the exact reverse, to which probably every
page of the record bears testimony that it was
misused and perverted.
Had these supervisors and registers the right,
or was it legal and right in them, to disregard
this fundamental guide to a just and proper con-
struction of this purposely ambiguous "oath,"
and to so contemn and disregard the organic
limitation which was imposed upon the con-
vention itself, as to absolutely exclude from
registration, as "accepted" voters, the "loyal
citizens " whom the record shows to have been
obedient to every legal requisition, including
prompt and faithful military duty, until they
were schemingly and cruelly driven from that
service by the construction which was placed
upon a new military order (No. 24), for "sym-
pathies" which seem always to have been
subordinate to their "loyalty," and which, in
the language again quoted from the court of
last resort, "were not even blameworthy?"
That these partisan registers—many of them
candidates on the same ticket with the con-
testee—did give to the constitutional and con-
curring (?) legislative enactment upon this
point a latitude of construction which not only
transcended but practically defeated the limit-
ation to which the organic ^ct (and the peo-
ple in voting for it) restricted the convention,
has been proven by the testimony of Register
Springer, (as to the so-called sympathizing lists
which were made by the military authorities
in 1862, and by which the registering officers
were instructed to be governed,) and by the
concurring testimony of Viglini, Riley, Bigger-
staff, and Ferguson, already referred to, in
Clinton, and of Hale, Brand, and others in
the counties of Carroll, Saline, Platte, and
Clay—pages 30, 31, 40, 43, and 45. By this
testimony it will be seen that the mere fact of
having been enrolled on the "sympathizing
list" of 1862 by the military subordinate for
the time being—whether with, without, or even
against the consent of the citizen—was to be,
and was, regarded as "conclusive evidence"
upon the point of his disloyalty; and that
neither the registering officer nor the board of
appeals, which consisted of the instructing
supervisor and the thus instructed registers
alone, "would hear any testimony in opposi-
tion to it." (
W ere, then, the 2,825 voters, which ara.proven
to have been either registered and polled for
the contestant as "rejected" voters, or rejected
from his poll of "accepted" voters by the
county canvassers of Clinton, Clay, and Jack-
son, legally or illegally rejected—at least in
the proportion established by Register Springer,
and which it is but fair to assume as the pro-
portion throughout the district? Referring
again to the testimony of the military enrolling
officers, and to the answer which had to be
everywhere made to "question29," (page 19;)
referring also to the testimony, which but re-
peats the law, that every citizen whose name
and vote stand thus recorded as "rejected"
had takyi and subscribed the so-called "oath
of loyalty" in full; and that if falsely taking it
they subjected themselves almost inevitably to
prosecutions for perjury before courts and juries
from whom they could at least expect no polit-
ical favor as against the partisan registers who
had rejected them; affd that, notwithstanding
the sixty days' additional time which was alio wed
to the contestee, in which to take rebutting and
other testimony in this case, he has placed
nothing upon the record to denote that even an
indictment had been found against either of
these supporters of the contestant for having
sworn falsely, throughout the district, in order
to get in a majority, upon my count, of 2,236
in my favor—if of this vast number of rejected
voters, whose status is written down as that of
"loyal men" in the uncontradicted and even
unrebutted record they have had presented for
your consideration—if with this, and the sys-
tematic and all-pervading unfairness and fraud
which the testimony establishes against the
registration and other official acts of the friends
and supporters of the contestee, from its open-
ing page to its concluding paragraph, it may
not be presumptively computed and concurred
in, that at least enough of them to have eleeted
the contestant were not "disloyal" in the sense
of the organic construction to which this oath
must necessarily be subordinate—if this may
not be so, the contestant must needs submit to
have his judgment corrected by the majority
of the House, in the view he has thus alone
insisted upon as entitling him to the seat in
controversy.
Looking a little further into the record, as
the only permissible basis for the argument or
the final disposition of this case, it will be seen,
at page 13, that GeorgeFunkliouser swears that
he had been sheriff for two years preceding ihe
election, the latter part of the time being ne-
cessarily under the appointment of Governor
Fletcher, and hence removing even a suspicion
as to his loyalty; that he had previously, for a
number ofyears, been sheriff and deputy sheriff,
and was hence well acquainted with the people
of the county, including those whose votes had
been rejected under the new constitution, and
that he did not regard the sympathies of those
with whom he was thus " well acquainted" as
amounting to disloyalty to the Government of
the United States, but that, on the contrary,
they were peaceable, law-abiding and law-sus-
taining citizens, claiming to be loyal notwith-
standing their sympathies.
In answer to the question which was con-
structed (in kmc verba.) upon the specific charge
that was made against a portion of my sup-
porters, in this county and elsewhere, in the
closing paragraph of the answer of the con-
testee, he swears specifically that he does not
"know or believe that any person of known
disloyalty, who had been in arms against the
United States or the State of Missouri, or
who had given aid and comfort to the enemies
of the United States or the State of Missouri,
or any outlaw, guerrilla, bushwhacker, or other
disloyal person, disqualified under the laws of
the State, was permitted to vote in the election
here in contest." Viglini, the old provost
marshal and enrolling officer, answers this
question as Funkliouser did, except as to the
county supervisor of registration, and he, it is
proven, was elected sheriff on the same ticket
with the contestee. Johnson swears that he
had resided in the county for upward of twenty
years, had been twice a judge of the county
court, was generally acquainted with the peo-
ple ; and having replied to the charge of the
contestee, just as the old sheriff did, answers
further and still more specifically, under the
cross-examination of the counsel for the con-
testee, that he does "not know of any man
voting on the rejected list who was disloyal
within the meaning of the terms of the new
constitution."
And yet the contestee neither condescends
or ventures to take any testimony, either to
sustain the charge upon which it was perhaps
mistakenly relied to bluff or badger the Repre-
