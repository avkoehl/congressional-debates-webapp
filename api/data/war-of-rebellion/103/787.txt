HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Gravelly Springs, Ala., February 28, 1865.

Major WILLIAM P. CHAMBLISS,Special Inspector of Cavalry, Louisville, Ky.:

Captain Simpson has just arrived. Sorry to learn status of horse question. He tells me there are about 7,000 horses at Louisville and Edgefield for recuperation. Please put these horses under charge of Captain Wilson for Hatch. I think I can arrange for their recuperation before you can possibly fill our requisitions for new horses, and they will be better after they are fixed up. Hatch is willing to take them, and I'm sure the scheme will work.

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.
HDQRS. CAVALRY CORPS, MIL. DIV. OF THE MISSISSIPPI, Gravelly Springs, Ala., February 28, 1865.

Colonel MACKAY,Chief Quartermaster, Department of the Cumberland:

COLONEL: It is of the utmost importance that I should cross my command to the south side of the river as rapidly as possible. I would therefore request that you employ all the steamers now at Eastport for this purpose, and detain any that may come hereafter.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. H. WILSON,

Brevet Major-General.

WATERLOO, ALA., February 28, 1865.

Major BEAUMONT,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

MAJOR: General Hatch having returned I shall consider my responsibility at Eastport terminated, and have so notified him. The river is still rising, though slowly. It is impossible to get to the landing at Waterloo or at Eastport. The Chickasaw banks are all high and dry, and will remain so. I doubt very much if we shall be able to cross for several days, and desire to know whether the general intends to cross at Eastport or Chickasaw. I presume, of course, the former. In the present condition of affairs, however, we could begin crossing at Chickasaw sooner, and thus save a day or two, but whether we should lose it by being unable to cross Bear Creek [which I learn is not fordable for thirty miles], I cannot say.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNO. T. CROXTON,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers.
