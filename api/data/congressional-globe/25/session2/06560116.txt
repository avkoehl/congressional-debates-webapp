ny, and the. supplj mg the currency for the Go-
vernment, -which cannot be worth le--s than one
million of dollars annually; and this euoimous mo-
nopoly would become a vested right, and forfeited
only by a breach of their contract with the Govern-
ment.
This league of respectable banks is required to
establish a sort of national currency, under the di-
rection of the Secretary of the Treasury. They are
to receive and pay out each other's notes, and thus
give them a general circulation. That this might
be done to ■some extent, is not denied, it is done now
by a combination of banks. What is called the
" Suffolk Alliance," at Boston, accomplishes this
object, and gives a general circulation, throughout
New England, to the noles of all the associated
banks. But this is a dangerous power, and ex
posed to great abuse.
But the most extraordinary feature in this scheme
is the novel and dangerous principle, which stands
out on the face of the amendment, that this league
of banks, acting in co-operation with the Secreiaiy
of the Treasury, is to " regulate" the entire bank-
ing system of.the country. This js to be effected
by frequent settlements with all hanks dealing with
them, or whose bills they receive, and by com-
pelling them to pay balances m specie when il is
found necessary to check their issues, and letting
the balances remain, or adjusting them in some
other way, when it is thought necessary to encou-
rage them to increase their issues All banks have,
of course, the power to demand of each other specie
for balances, and the only purpose of this provision
m the amendment is to make it the duly of the
Secretary of the Traasury to compel the Treasury
banks to exercise this power, for the purpose of
regulating the entire banking sj stern of the country
These banks have also the power of determining
what money shall be received for the public dues,
for they are not obliged to take even the bills of
such other banks as may comply with the pre-
scribed condition of issuing no notes of less deno-
mination than ten dollars, and can refuse the bills
of all banks but the Treasury league is this a safe
power to entrust to few banks' Is, it not a power
which Congress ought itself to exercise? It is true,
this power was entrusted to the late United States
Bank, but n was abused, and ought never again to
be confided to any bank or system of banks Be-
sides, it was not then considered, a  it seems to be
now, by many, and particularly by the author of
this amendment, that the íeceivability ot bank notes
iiy the United States w as an essential element of
their credit. It is urged as the principal objection
lo the bill reported by the committee, that the re-
fusal to receive the paper of the local tanks is to
discredit them, and yet it is proposed to confer on
the twenty-five Treasury banks the power of dis-
crediting any other bank, and all others, m the
country.
That this system of banks might conduct the
financial affairt of the Government well enough, as
long as the banks lemain in a sound and healthy
condition, may be admitted This the late deposite
hanks did for more than two years, and until they
became deranged But the diffierlty is, that the
cornection of the Treasury wjib them, instead of
tending to keep them in a sound state, andgne
steadiness and regulant) to their action, will have
a directly contrary influence, as experience has
proved. The large amount of public moneys which
are suddenly received and withdrawn give great
irregularity to the action of the banks connected
with the Treasury. This was the case of the late
United States Bank, and with the State deposite
banks, m 1814, '15, and '16, and during the recent
employment of them since 1834
The princ.ple for regulating the currency of all
the State banks, through the action of these depo-
site banks, is the same as that of a National Bank
It confeis on the Treasury banks a power which is
nearly useless for good, but omnipotent for evil
The transactions between banks are entirely diffe-
rent from those betw een them and the public In
their dealings with the public, they make use of
their own ci edit, and as credit costs nothing, and is
v ' mited, the banks could extend their discounts
without limit, (or until the public began to doubt
their solvency, which would bring their bills bacjj
for itdemption) were it not for their be-ng received
by other banks, who leturn them for payment m
something else than the credit ot the bank issuing
them The dealings of the banks with each oihei
require that they pay their balances, if notm spe-
cie, at least in something of some value, and not in
their own credit.
This is the only principle by wbuch the banks
can check and regulate each othei, and its action is
recipiecal, the small banks check the large ones as
much as ihe latter check them, according to ihe ex-
tent of their business But to give any «¡aluuiy
influence to this restraining and regulating pimei-
ple, whether m a National Bank or a league of
Treasury banks, it is important that such banks
pursue a steady course themsehes, and avoid all
sudden expansions or contractions ot their issues.
Hence all attempts to íegulate the general bank
currency of the countiy by the agency of a Na-
tional Bank connected with the Treasury, or State
deposite banks, have signally failed, because the
action oí all such banks is as uiegular and fluc-
tuating as that of other banks, and, indeed,
more so, from ihe very fact of their connection with
the Treasury This new scheme, therefoie, foi ic-
gulating the bank cmieiicv, would be impractica-
ble and inefficient for any good put pose, because
the--e veiy regulating banks would themselves, tike
the late United Slates Bank, cause the veiy irregu-
larities they are designed to prevent It is the in-
stinct of all banks to act solely with refeience to
then piofits, and consequently to use then credit to
then utmost extent When these Tieasury banks,
or a National Bank, are increasing then discounts,
and consequently their circulation, how can they
check the like increase by other banks1 By return-
ing then bills, and demanding specie for nalannsi
Certainly not, because ihe balances will be against
them The large amount of their own notes put
m circulation fall into other banks, which ¡riii-.
balances agamsi these icgulattng banl>s 11ns ['
pioposmon is so clear, that it cu nted no piooi,
but if it did, the experience of the hte Nauoi al
Bank would afford abundant testimony
When that institution commenced extending Us
discounts in November, 5830, and continued ex-
panding until May, 1832, having enlarged the u
nearly thirty millions of dollars, the State banks
did the same, because the check ol that bank upon
them, and of the Slate banks on each other, was le-
laxed, and when, in August, 1834, after the remo-
val of the deposites from the United States Bank, il
commenced a rapid curtailment, the State insti-
tutions were compelled to do the same, in ordei to
meet the balances which the United Stales Bank
obtained against them; and when the Bank of the
United States, in November, 1834, began to ex-
pand, the State banks followed in the same course,
and both went on expanding during the years 1835
and 1836, which is the primaiy cause of all the
disorders in the currency, and derangement of busi-
ness, that have since ensued The wme state of
things, although not to the <ame exiuit, existed m
England Tnr Bank of England expanded during
the two first quartnrs of 1836, and mcitased Us
issues nearly tuo millions sterling, and during the
same period, the joint stock banks multiplied ra-
pidly in number, and increased their issues thrre or
four millions, which occasioned the over-trading m
thit countrv
Yet, with thee indisputable f'cts before the
world, it is contended that a national bank can
" regulate" the State banks, and it is now pioposed
to do the same through the agency of a league of
Treasury banks Ihe scheme is impracticable
Instead of regulating the currency, thtse Treasu.y
banks would only mciease its natural tendencies to
disorder, as was the case from 1814 to 1817, and
since 1834 to the final cJtastrophe in May last.
But, sir, if this part of the plan was practicable,
ought it to he established' Would it be safe to con-
fide to the Secretary of the Treasury a pov-er so
tremendous as that of regulating and controlling
the whole currency of the ciuntrj' ot deteimining
when money should be plenty, and when scarce'
Is it possible to conceive of any power more
alarming, more corrupting, or more dangerous?
Is it not evident, from this examination of this
plan—is it not, indeed, appaient, upon the very
lace of it, that it w ouid be a national bank con-
nected with ihi Treasure a national bank with-
out a parent bank—the Set retar} of ihe Treasury
being the head' In point of fact, howevei, a* the
Pe'insj Ivania Bank of the United Stales must be
one, that institution, from its vast capital and cre-
dit, so entirely dispropoitioned toady other bank,
would become the head of the system, and control
the whole machinery as completely and absolutely
as it did its own branches.
Most of the objections urged against the lull
pioviding for an Independent Treasury, apply
with a bundled times more force to this The
influence which it gi/es to the Executive, by
uniting it nith the entire banking system of the
country, is truly alaimmg, and would hardly fail
ol gradually changing, and ultimately subverting,
the whole system of the Government. It has
been a standing objection to the bill of the com
vmttee, that it establishes two currencies, one for
the Government, and one for the people, but this
scheme establishes three distinct currencies First,
the currency to be supplied by the Treasury banks,
which is to form a national paper currency, ami
have a general circulation, secondly, the currency
raen able for the public dues, (other than'hat of
the league of banks,) consisting of the notes of
su. h banks as may restrict their issues to bills of a
less denomination than ten dollars, and thirdly, the
no^ of banks not receivable for public dues. The
Independent Treasury bill is said to provide two
tables, one for the officers of the Government,
and the other for the people. This provides three
one for the officers of the Government, and the
oligauh/ of banks, one, I suppose, for the tra-
ding community, and the third for the laboring
classes, to be supplied with the coarse and homely
(are, consisting of the bills or rags of those banks

Bet, -,ir, then is one objection to this system, of
gi< u uei^ht, m my judgment, winch I cannot pass
ovei unnoticid It creates an impiopci, if not un-
constitulional, connection between the Federal Go-
v eminent and ihe institutions of the States, which,
on Ihe one hand, renders this Government depen-
dí nt on Slate institutions, and on the other, with-
drms those institutions from their proper sphere
of action, and, in some measure, converts them
into Federal corporations Have we any power
to do this' And does it not blend and confound
the powers of the Union and those of the States,
so as to go far to obliterate those distinct marks of
sepaiation, so essential m our system This
substitute for the bill changes and modifies the
chuttrs of the State banks, takes them into the
sci vice of the United States, and subject? them to
it supu vision and control. This, it is true, is to
be done by conluict, based on a law of Congress,
but all chattels are consideied as contracts It is
to be done by the consent of the institutions, but
these corpo aiionsaie not independent sovereign-
tics in liw, if thry aiein fact, they are the creatures
of the States, and subject to their will, and there is
to be no consent of the States If this Government
tan rightfully inteifere with the banking institu-
tions o, ihe States, why can >t not interfere with
coiporations for education or courts of justice'
I hav e passed over one objection to this plan,
which I intended to notice These banks are lo be
nominated by the Secretary of the Treasury, and
confirmed by a joint resolution of Congress, and,
when appointed, arc to be discontinued by a joint
le-o'^don of Congress This will expose Con-
gics to that corrupt influence which attends all
log sfation concerning banks Suppose the Penn-
s hama Bank (f ihe United States «as appointed
as oí e if these Tieasu'y oanks, and its conduct
shoi' i oe such, thit it became necessary to with-
¡i i v ih  deposites Horn it, would not the influence
of thai bank be brought to beai directly on Con-
greso Of the nature and danger of that influence,
I need but refer to ihe circumstance that a report
of a committee of this body, friendly to that bank,
disclosed the startling fact that mote than fifty
members of Congress, while the bank was strug-
gling for a recharter, had been accommodated with
loans, amounting, in all, to the enowpons sum of
