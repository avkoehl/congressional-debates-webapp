ment, and I appeal to you now not to be unmindful that the foe that strikes at our State strikes though our desolation at the life of the Republic, and our people are plundered and driven from their homes solely because of their loyalty and fidelity to our free institutions. People of Pennsylvania! I owe to you all my faculties, my labors, my life. You owe to your country your prompt and zealous services and efforts. The time has now come when we must all stand or fall together in defense of our duty that posterity shall not blush for us. Come heartily and cheerfully to the rescue of our noble Commonwealth. Maintain now your honor and freedom. Given under my hand and the great seal of the State, at Harrisburg, this twenty-sixth day of June, in the year of our Lord one thousand eight hundred and sixty-three, and of the Commonwealth the eighty-seventh.
