ANNAPOLIS, MD., May 9, 1863.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

I have received your telegram of to-day. I fear that when we have hot weather 3,000 prisoners will be too many for the buildings intended for their use. I think it better to not send more than 2,000 at first, unless there are no barracks for them elsewhere.

C. A. WAITE,

Colonel, Commanding.

Brigadier General W. A. HAMMOND,

Surgeon-General U. S. Army, Washington.

GENERAL: I would respectfully inquire if there is a general hospital at Saint Louis to which paroled prisoners could be sent from Annapolis occasionally. There is an application by the parents of some sick at Annapolis for permission to take them home, and would like to know to what hospital they could report if they do not recover by the expiration of their leave.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Colonel W. HOFFMAN, Commissary-General of Prisoners:

I am here with 133 exchanged officers. We are all entirely destitute and suffering for decent clothing. We ask that we may stop over here and be paid. We have no means even to procure subsistence on the route. Can I visit Washington this afternoon?
