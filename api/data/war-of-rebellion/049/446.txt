Brigadier-General CULLUM,

Chief of Staff:

My information from Lewisburg is that General Averell's victory was most decisive at Droop Mountain. The enemy's force engaged was over 4,000. They acknowledged a loss of 300 killed and wounded. General Averell took over 100 prisoners, including field officers, 1 stand of colors, 3 pieces of artillery, large number of small-arms, camp equipage, and wagons. A violent snow-storm prevailed at Lewisburg on the 8th. General Duffie's command had returned to Gauley, and Colonel Moor, with General Averell's infantry, is returning to Beverly.

B. F. KELLEY,

Brigadier-General.
