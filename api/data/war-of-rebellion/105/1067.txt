Lieutenant-Colonel First Infantry California Volunteers, Commanding
HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF OREGON,Fort Vancouver, Wash. Ter., May 12, 1862.

ASSISTANT ADJUTANT-GENERAL:

Headquarters Department of the Pacific, San Francisco, Cal.:

SIR: I have the honor to transmit inclosed copy of communication* to Colonel Cornelius, Oregon Cavalry. Seven companies of this regiment have been mustered into service with their officers. Three of them have reached the minimum standard, and have under the authority granted been mustered into service in accordance with general orders from the Adjutant-General's Office, announcing the plan of organization for the volunteer corps. Of the remaining four companies there will be enough enlisted men from the returns exhibited at these headquarters by the colonel to complete the regimental organization for six companies, as directed by the commanding general of the department. General Orders, Numbers 1, Adjutant-General's Office, dated January 6, 1862, precribe the mode of mustering into service volunteers, and in my instructions to consolidate and merge into six companies, compliance is made therewith.

He expresses himself impressed with its value, and will receive from me every assistance to make troops fit for active service. Many of the men of this regiment have been enlisted five and six months without having received clothing from the Government. The colonel represents the difficulty he has had in providing for the positive necessities of his men in this respect, and since recent directions which he has received from department headquarters "not to make any more purchases," of actual suffering. To diminish the expense of quartering and subsiting a fraction of one company (Captain Currey's), now at Camp Barlow, near Oregon City, and to complete company organization by mercing with a detachment now at this post, under Captain Kelly, I offered to receive Captain Currey's men here temporarily. The colonel represents such actual destitution of the necessary articles of clotnt their
