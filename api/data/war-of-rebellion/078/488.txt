LOUISVILLE, September 26, 1864.

General SCHOFIELD:

General Meredith telegraphs from Paducah that a rebel force of cavalry of 500, which he considers the advance of a larger force, is advancing toward Paducah from Jackson, and asks for re- enforcements. Captain Dickson says General Burbridge has no troops.

J. A. CAMPBELL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

BULL'S GAP, September 26, 1864.

Captain W. P. AMMEN:

Twenty-five of Brazelton's men did the damage. The Fifteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry was near running on them. They are out of the way now. The enemy reported east of Greenville. Telegraph Dillard at gap to return as soon as he goes as far as he proposed, as he may meet more than he bargained for. He must take care of his post. Courier can be forwarded to him from the gap.

J. AMMEN,

Brigadier-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Atlanta, Ga., September 26, 1864.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: Send Corse's DIVISION up, ready to embark for Rome. I will see him and instruct him. I don't know what to do with Vandever, but he can command the post, and leave Corse to put the DIVISION in good order. I would like you to get about 1,000 men from the MISSISSIPPI over to Eastport, at the head of the Tennessee, and have the Memphis cavalry reach across to that point, via Iuka, occasionally. The enemy will use superhuman efforts to cut our road.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.

WASHINGTON, D. C., September 27, 1864-9 a. m.

Major-General SHERMAN,

Atlanta, Ga.:

You say Jeff. Davis is on a visit to Hood. I judge that Brown and Stephens are the objects of his visit.

A. LINCOLN.

ATLANTA, September 27, 1864-10 a. m.

(Received 7 p. m.)

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Jeff. Davis was certainly at Macon on the 23d, for he made a very significant speed, which is given at length, and which I ordered to be telegraphed as far as Louisville. Forrest has burned the bridge over Elk River, near Athens, but I think Rousseau can keep him off the Chattanooga road; still, all recruits should be sent to Nashville with dispatch.

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General.
