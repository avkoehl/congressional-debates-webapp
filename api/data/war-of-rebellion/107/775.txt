General S. WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, near Alexandria:

The commanding general desires to procure the return to his headquarters of Major Haller's command, and the regulars of late Willard's battalion, and begs you to take the necessary steps to secure this object. He wishes you to request General Burnside by telegraph to instruct Captain McIntyre's squadron to report to him (General McClellan), immediately upon its arrival from Aquia. The general has decided to drop the heading "Army of the Potomac," and to say from the present simply "Headquarters."

HEADQUARTERS,Washington, September 1, 1862.

General WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Headquarters near Alexandria:

Telegraphic communication with General Cox will do. No hurry about that. The general does not wish the batteries of Sumner's corps to move to the front, nor any wagon trains whatever on the Little River turnpike toward Fairfax Court-House. Any trains which may be within a reasonable distance of Alexandria may be stopped and got into position, if possible, to move either way. Abercrombie's brigade will prepare itself to march at short notice, but will await orders.

By command:

JAS. A. HARDIE,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.
