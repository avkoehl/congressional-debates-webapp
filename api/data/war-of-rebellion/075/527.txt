HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION CAVALRY,Lost Mountain Post-Office, June 19, 1864.

General W. L. ELLIOTT:

GENERAL: Yesterday evening my scouting parties found and drove in rebel pickets on all the road leading from here to Marietta and Powder Springs. I have heard nothing from the Second Brigade yet, but suppose it somewhere in the vicinity of Acworth. I send you two papers (rebel) of the 15th and 17th.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION CAVALRY,June 19, 1864-8.50 p. m.

Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT:

GENERAL: I went down to-day on Marietta road to Noeys' Creek. Some of Schofield's infantry was there fighting the enemy's cavalry, and could not cross on account of high water. They are fortifying along the banks to-night. I also had a detachment toward Chattahoochee River, the other side of Powder Springs, and one to Dallas. Nothing was found on either road except small parties of their scouts. I am satisfied that the whole of the enemy's force is falling back toward the river and our left. There is nothing but cavalry on Johnston's left. The citizens of Atlanta are all reported moving out. This comes from several different sources, and I suppose indicates the intention of the enemy. If I can ever find that Second Brigade again I will move my camp to Powder Springs, unless you desire otherwise. It is a better position to strike from, should opportunity offer.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,June 19, 1864.

Brigadier General E. M. McCOOK,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I am directed by the major-general commanding to inform you that the enemy has left our front on the Marietta and Sandtown road, and Major-General Stoneman is reconnoitering the roads leading in the direction of Sandtown. General Sherman requested last evening that the reconnaissance should be made on the Powder Springs road and roads leading from it toward the Sandtown road and the Chattahoochee, in the vicinity of that place, which General Stoneman would have done but for this change in affairs. In the absence of definite instructions to the contrary from Major-General Thomas, the commanding general requests you to move down the Powder Springs road and scout all roads leading in the direction of the Sandtown road and toward the Chattahoochee, near Sandtown, and discover, if possible, what the enemy is doing.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. WHERRY,

Major and Aide-de-Camp.
