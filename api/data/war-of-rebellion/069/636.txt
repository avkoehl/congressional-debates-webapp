The rebels fired three return shots, apparently from the 12-pounder gun. several heads are visible along their line, but I think not so many as heretofore.

Colonel C. J. PAINE:

There was no communication other than the one which I have forwarded addressed to the officer commanding the Federal forces, &amp;c. The flag came out, and on being met delivered the letter and returned.

CITY POINT, June 5, 1864- 1 p. m.

General BUTLER:

The commander of the pickets reports that heavy trains have been running between Richmond and Petersburg or in corresponding direction since 3 this a. m. The sounds from the railroad have been distinct and clear, and sentinels state that they have heard what they suppose to be drums in the same direction and at a great distance.

HINKS,

Brigadier-General.

JUNE 5, 1864.

(Received 2.45 p. m.)

General HINKS:

Send out scouts and see if you can confirm your news of large trains running from Petersburg. Put a watch with a good glass at the point near Spring Hill, where I watched the other day, to watch as long as daylight lasts, and so into the night with reliefs, for a railroad train can be seen in the night.

No guns were visible at Fort Clifton yesterday and only 1 man. I have just sent an officer to a point on the bank from which the fort is best exposed to view. Will report again on his return.
