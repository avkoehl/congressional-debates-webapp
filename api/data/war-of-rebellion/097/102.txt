capitol marked "commissaries accounts." Of course this intended to deceive. A train of pontoons went on the Central road a short distance, but was brought back, and has now been sent to the Staunton River. An order has been issued in the Howard Grove Hospital for all those who are fit for the field to be sent immediately to the front, and those not ready to be sent, and who will not be so in fifteen days, are to be sent to Lynchburg or Farmville.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

Lieutenant-General GRANT,

City Point:

I received information to-day that a staff officer of C. M. Wilcox was in High Point, N. C., which is fifteen miles southwest of Greensborough, about the 9th of this month. Although this is not positive information of the presence of Wilcox's division there, it may be confirmation of other information which you may have, and I think it proper to report it.
