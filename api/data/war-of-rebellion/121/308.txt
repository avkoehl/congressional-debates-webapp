3. Private A. A. Williams, First Maryland Cavalry, is also at Fort Warren, not treated as a prisoner of war. He has been sentenced to imprisonment for the war.

These facts have been stated in writing to me by Captain Frank Battle, who very recently left Fort Warren. I am entirely satisfied that an inquiry will assure you that these representations are correct. I request that these parties be delivered without further delay. The case of Lieutenant Davis is a peculiarly aggravated one.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.

RICHMOND, February 25, 1865.

Lieutenant Colonel JOHN E. MULFORD, Assistant Agent of Exchange:

SIR: There is an old citizen of Westmoreland County, Va., James W. English by name, who is now in hospital at Point Lookout. He is fifty-five years old. He is a very innoffensive man. There are no charges against him, and neither he nor his friend know why he has been kept so long in captivity. He has been a prisoner for nearly two years and in now in a critical state of health. I wil be much obliged to you if you will cause him to be released and delivered by next flag-of-truce boat. I have ordered all persons in anything like a similar position in the South to be sent to Richmond for delivery to you.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

RO. OULD,

Agent of Exchange.
