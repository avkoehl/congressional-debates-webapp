Mr KING remarked, that the committee had
made a remarkably short report, he wished the
chairman would oblige him by giving his reasons
Mr GRUNDY replied for the best reason in
the world There was> no reason set forth in the
memorial which stated why their prayer ought ¡o be
granted It was not the duty of the Committee to
search for reasons wrnch were not known to exist
Mr KING remarked, that the law authorizing
the extension of bonds on duties, had proved m
many cases in effect worse than useless It was
on account of the enormous fees required by the
prosecuting officer. It was never contemplated m
the passage of the law that for an extension for a
few months, the merchant was doomed to pay four
or five hundred dollars The object of the law was
to relieve not to distress the merchants.

The following is a copy of these resolutions, as
they passed the Senate
I    Resolved, That, m the adoption of the Federal
Constitution, the States adopting the same acted,
severally, as free, independent, and sovereign
States, and that each, for itself, by its own volun-
tary assent, entered the Union with the view to its
increased security against all dangers, domestic as
well as foreign, and the more perfect and secure
enjoyment of its advantages, natural, political, ind
social
II   Resolved, That m delegating a portion of their
powers to be exercised by the Federal Govern-
ment, the States retained, severally, the exclusive
and sole right over their own domestic institutions
and police to the full extent to which those powers
were not thus delegated, and are alone responsible
for them, and that any intermeddling of any one
or more States, or a combination of their citizens,
with the domestic mstituions and police of the
olheis, on any ground, political, moral, or religious,
or under any pretext whatever, with the view to
their alteration or subversion, is not warranted by
the Constitution, tending to endanger the domestic
peace and tranquillity of the States interfered with,
subversive of the objects for which the Constitution
was formed, and, by necessary consequence, tend-
ing to weaken and destroy the Union itself.
III   Resolved, That this Government was insti-
tuted and adopted by the several States of this
Union as a common agent, m order to carry into
effect the powers which they had delegated by ¡¡the
Constitution for their mutual security and prospe-
rity, and that in fulfilment of this high and sacred
trust, this Government is bound so to exercise its
powers, as not to inferiere with the stability and se-
curity of the domestic institutions of the States that
compose the Union , and that it is the solemn duty
of the Government to resist, to the extent of its con-
stitutional power, all attempts by one portion of the
Union to use it as an instrument to attack the do-
mestic institutions of anothei, or to weaken or de-
stroy such institutions
IV. Resolved, That domestic slavery, as it ex-
ists in the Southern and Western States of this
Union,composes an important part of their domes
tic institutions, inherited from their ancestors, and
existing at the adoption of the Constitution, by
which it is recognised as constituting an important
element in the apportionment of powers among
the States, and that no change of opinion or feel
mg on the part of the other States of the Union m
relation to it, can justify them or thfir oiti7ens in
open and systematic attacks thereon, «ith the
new to its o\erthiow, and that all such at-
tacl s are in manifest violation of the mutual and
solemn pledge to piotect and defend each other,
given by the States respective!}, on en'enng into
the constitutional compact which formed the Union,
and as such aie a manifest breach sf faith, and a
■violation of the most solemn obligations.
V Resolved, That the interference by the citizens
of any of the States, with the view to the abolition
of slavery in this District, io endangering the rights
and security of the people of the District, and that
any act or measure of Congresk designed to abolish
* slavery in this District, would be a violation of the
faith implied in the cessions by the States of Vir-
ginia and Maryland, a just cause of alarm to the
people 0i|he slaveholdmg States, and have a direct
and inevitable tendency to disturb and endanger
the Union.        ,
Jlnd reselvel, T&at any attempt of Congress to
abolish slavery in any Temtory of the United
States in which it exists, wou'd create serious
alarm, and just apprehension, in the States sus-
taining that domestic institution, would be a viola-
tion of good faith towards the inhabitants of any
such Territory who have been permitted to settle
! with, and hold slaves therein, because the people
! of any such Territory have not asked foi the abo
htion of slavery therein, and because when any
such Territory shall be admitted into the Union as
a State, the people thereof will be entitled to decide
that question exclusively for themselves
Mr ALLEN then moved to append the follow-
ing resolution
Jlesohed, That nothing in the foregoing resolu
tions is intended lo íecognise the right ot Congress
to impair in any manner the freedom of speech,
of the press, or the right of petition, as secured
by the Constitution to the citizens of the several
States within the States respectively.
On this question a long and animated discussion
took place, in which Messis SMITH of Indiana,
MORRIS, ALLEN, WALKER, and others, par-
ticipated
Mr. ALLEN proposed to modify his resolution,
by striking out all after the word "Constitution"
and t" insert, "of th  United States, and of the
States respectively, to their citizens "
Mr SMITH of Indiana moved to amend Mr
Ar len's proposition, by staking out all after the
word " resolved," and inserting the following •
" That notmng m these resolutions should be
constmed or understood as intending to impair,
or in any manner abridge the right of speech or of
the people, or the right of petition, as secured by
the Constitution of the United States, and the seve-
ral States, and the right of petition is hereby ex-
pressly declared to include the duty on the part of
Congress to receive and determine upon the prayer
of the petitioners "
This amendment also Occasioned some further
discussion, when Mr SMITH proposed so to
amend it as to read
" That nothing in those resolutions shall be con
strued or understood as intending to impair or in
any manner abridge the freedom of speech or of
the piess, or the right of petition, which Is hereby
expressly declared to include the duty on the part
of the Senate to receive and determine upon the
petitions "
