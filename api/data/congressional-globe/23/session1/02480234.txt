234                                   THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.     ________       March 13,
on that occasion he had also said, h s vote should
be given on that side which should be most likely
to bfing the subject to a satisfactory and speedy
conclusion So much for the past Now to whom
is delay to be justly attributed' After seven weeks'
delay, each oí these gentlemen voted against bring
mg that prelnrunai y discussion to a close The
report is now befme the House for action, ordered
to be printed, but not punted, not read, or yet
seen Tne motion is to put off the debate, for that
purpose, is now resisted, on the gioumi of de-
lay
Mr L desired not only to see and read the report
and appendix, bat also to hear the gentleman from
Rhode Island, whose illuminated mind would no
doubt throw much light around it That he should
avail himself of all the means in his power, all the
lights of the gentleman, to arrive at a just conclu-
sion, always excepting a blue light
Mr BURD made a few remirks in favor of the
postponement. On another occasion he might go
into details in relation to the distress pervading the
country. He thought the question ought to be
decided within a reasonable or pioper time, after
due consideration of every fact coanected with the
condition of the country, and the laws and the
Constitution of the country
Mr WILDE said that so far as he was con-
cerned, he hoped the House would acquit him of
any extraordinary urgency At one time his
speech was cut off by the previous ques'ion, and
though he did not suppose that the object of the
motion to postpone was again to cut off his speech,
yet he was somewhat surprised that when he was
ready to proceed, and the chairman of the commit-
tee did not wish himself to speak, the House should
not be willing to hear him He assured the gen-
tleman, as the determination was to keep the tour-
niquet on the debate, so as to amputate it any
time, he could not tell how long the debate would
last But if he could be allowed to consume these
two days, there would certainly be left two days
for others who were to follow him He stated
that documents, to procure which the postpone-
ment was asked, would be of no aid to the gentle-
man from Indiana, in undeistanding his speech,
as he should not refer to them, andas they had no
relation to the points he should discuss He also
«aid, that the main positions of the majority of the
committee, that the deposites ought not to be re-
itored, and that the bank ougnt not to be «char-
tered, &.c , would not be at all affected by the
documents referred to He had no disposition to
facilitate or hasten the passing of the appropriation
bills He did not ceitamly know what would
follow the passage of those bills But he was
enabled to guess that, when they were passed, an
attempt would be made to precipitate the decision
of other questions, in a mannei which to him ap-
pealed inexplicable As, however, the question
whether he bhould speak to-day or not, was ltkely
to occupy the whole day, he would wundraw his
objection to the motion
The question was then taken on the motion of
Mr McKENNAN, to postpone the subject till
Tuesday week, and rejected
The motion to postpone till Tuesday next "was
agreed to without division
Mr T a ADAMS asked the unanimous con-
feu of the House to present certain resolutions
of the Legislature of Massachusetts; which was
objected to
Mr ADAMS moved the suspension of the rule,
which was negatived
Mr POLK moved the suspension of the rule,
bo as to permit him to offer the following resolu-
tion
Resolved, That the report of the Committee of
Ways and Means on the removal of the deposites
from the Bank of the United States, be the stand-
ing order of the day for Tuesday next, at one
o'clock,and on each succeeding day in every week,
Saturdays excepted, at the same hour until dis-
posed of, and that until the hour of one o'clock,
P M , on each day, the business of the House
shall proceed in the order prescribed by the rules
of the House
The motion to suspend was agreed to.
The SPEAKER stated that the resolution must
lie on the table one day
Mr. POLK moved to suspend the rules of the
House in order to proceed to the consideration of
the resolution.
Mr. McDUTFlE asked whether the resolution,
if it was acted upon now, would not fall behind all
other resolutions
The CHAIR replied in the affirmative
Mr McDTJFFIE said he was therefore in favor
of its consideration now.     *
The motion to suspend was agreed to
Mr. HANNEGAN moved also to except Mon-
days as well as Saturdays
Mr POLK said it would be understood, that
for the purpose of receiving memorials, the House
might susDend theiuleon Mondays, buthe would
consent to modify his resolution so as to except
Saturdays and Mondays, aftei the piesentauon of
petitions.
Mr McDUFFIE mc ed a proviso, that peti
tions and memorials shall be received on Monday
Mr POLK accepted the proviso, and Mi
HANNEGAN withdrew his motion
Mi ELLSWORTH asked whether the report,
if this resolution was earned, would be discussed
in the House or in committee
The CHAIR replied, that when the report was
taken up, it would be in order to move the com-
mitment of the repon
Mi MERCER opposed the resolution, for the
reason that it would embarrass and delay the busi-
ness of the Houte
Mr ADAMS, of Massachusetts, opposed the
resolution If it passed it was extremely probable
that no other subjects could be consideied at this
session He alluded to the presentation of the
Virginia resolution , which were not expected to
produce any debate Butone gentlemanfrom Vn-
ginia rose and made a speech of three hours upon
it, with the force and eloquence of which he was
much delighted The debate had been continued,
ever since, and was likely to continue, whenever it
should be 11 order to take up lesolutions He re
ferred also to the fact that the debate had gone far
beyond the subject of the Virginia lesolutions, and
might continue till the fust Monday of next De-
cember, should the House sitso long The speech
of the eloquent gentleman fiom South Carolina did
not at all relate to the subject of the resolutions
Mi   A  wished to say, that he did not caie one
straw  whether the question  in relation  to the
deposites snould oe tdken now, or thiee months
hence     He did not believe that a decision here
would decide the question      Those who laid that
flattering unction to  .heir souls would find them
selves mistaken     It had  been  said to day by a
membei, that it would be vain for the people to
go to the Executive for íelief     He would add,
that it weie vain for the people to come to us for
relief    They must look  to   themselves, and to
themselves alone    He believed that the decision
of this House three months hence would be the
same that it would be now     Where was the ne
ces-,ity of pressing this subject'    He cared veiy
little when  or how the  House  acted   upon  the
propositions of the committee     He could see no
reason why the House should clog itself with this
resolution, for no member of tne House could lay
his hand upon his heart, and say that the decision
of the House would be different three months hence I
from the decision which it would make now.    If |
we go on with the debate, we cnanot take up the 1
appropriation bills, about whicn the gentleman
from Tennessee was so justly anxious.
Well, sir, it is circulated in whispers in the
House, and around about the House, that as we
have not had sufficient specimens of the exeicise
of royal prerogative, aftei due time, when the
chanman thinks that the subject has been suffi
ciently debated, the discussion will be closed by
the previous question, preparatory to such a dis-
agreement of the two Houses as will render this
House the instrument of the exeicise of another
royal prerogative He was not disposed to ciedit
eveiythmg which he heard, but from what he had
seen this morning, he was led to believe that the
minority of this House would be deprived of its
just rights, and the people would be deprived of
•heir constitutional right to present theu grievances
to this House.
The SPEAKER said that he would take this
occasion to inform the House that these discus
sions had not the approbation of the Chair, and
that the Chair was not responsible for them
Mi POLK said that he could not consider that
much that had fallen from thegentleman from Mas-
sachusetts was very releí ant to the question uefore
the House, it was not necessary foi him to reply
at large to it He would, howevei, say, that his
object in presenting the resolution that he had sub-
mitted, was foi tne purpose of insuring to ti e great
subject full discussion, yet, at the same time, have
some regard for other interests to come up before
the House.
With respect to what the gentleman had re-
maiked about the previous question, he begged to
inquiieif his actions formerly were consistent with
his present opinion? Was not that gentleman
found voting for the previous question, when the
motion to rechartet the bank was only carried by
tne \ erv turning of the screws which he now dep-
íecates so much > He could not help feeling that
such repeated íeference to the call for the previous
question was intended to reflect upon him for the
use of it But in the dischaige of the duty as-
signed him, he would not be deterred, he would
always take such a course as a sense of duty only
would dictate It was well understood that, from
the natuie of all numerous legislative bodies,
Congress ought to have a pioper control over all
subjects to be debated in it, and when the subject
should come up on Tuesday, they would then
have to decide whether they would send the sub-
ject into Committee of the Whole on the state of
the Union—where there could be no previous
ques'ion—or not. The country, however, ex-
pected action from them upon it, and whether their
decision might or not, as was said, be obhgatoiy
or not upon the people, yet they were bound to
give that decision—the decision of Congress The
course taken by him in attaining it, by mak.ng
the subject the spec al order of the day, to the ex-
clusion of other subjects, was following that of
last session, upon the tariff, and this session upon
the question of the deposites But notwithstand-
ing this, he trusted that full opportunity would be
afforded to the honorable member to present the
Massachusetts resolves, and tlrft the debate on
those fiom Virginia, which he so much dreaded,
would ere long be brought to a close
Mr McDUFFIE remarked that it did not ap-
pear to him that any actual change was made
by the resolution, to prevent the leception of peti-
tions and memorials. The previous ouestion was
always in the power of the majority for them to
use over the minority, it was not therefore for the
minority to provoke them into the use of it by un-
profitable discussion Asa certain time would in
all probability be granted by the majority, if any
more time was wasted, the minoitty would only
be burning out their own cat die He was most
anxious to meet the question fan ly, and then have
a decision upon it.
Mr VIN rON submitted an amendment " that
so much only of the leport of the Committee of
Ways and Means as related to the removal of the
deposites " should be the order of the day
Mr COULTER considered that, under all the
circumstances, the postponement sought by the
chanman of tne Committee of Ways and Means
ought to have been arceded to, and that it was
for the advantage of those in favor of the bank, to
agree to the resolution making the subject the
special order of the day
After a few remarks from Mr. HARDIN,
Mr McDUFf IE inquired the state of the ques-
tion
The SPEAKER explained, and said the ques-
tion would be subject to all the rules of other
privileged questions when it came up on Tuesday
next
Mr DICKSON asked if it would be in order for
a majority of the House on Tuesday next to order
the subject to be referred to the Committee of the
Whole on the state of the Union.
The SPEAKER replied m the affirmative.
The resolution, as modified, was then read, and
agreed to, after which,
The House adjourned.
IN SENATE.
Thursday, March 13, 1834
Mr   HENDRICKS, fiom  the Committee on
Roads and Canals, reported a bill appropriating
