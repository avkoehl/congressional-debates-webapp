In addition to the above, the following casualties occurred in the artillery battalion of my command; One commissioned officer killed, 4 enlisted men killed, 17 wounded, and 4 missing, making an aggregate of 2,792 killed, wounded, and missing in the entire command during the campaign.

I visited the battle-field of Pickett's Mills, or New Hope Church, twice after the evacuation of the enemy, and examined it closely. The numerous single graves and several lines of trenches (capable of containing from twenty-five to forty bodies) on the battle-field outside of the enemy's intrenchments explain where most of the 255 missing of that day went to. It is known that many of the wounded and killed, owing to the close proximity of the places they fell to the enemy's works, could not be brought away. It is also certain from other facts that only a small number of uninjured men and officers-perhaps 20-became separated, in the darkness of the night and the denseness of the woods, from their commands when the field was abandoned at 10 p. m. The rebels in their accounts, while admitting the severity of the attack, have never pretended they made material capture of prisoners.

Some of those reported missing may yet return, but it is probable that by far the large part were either killed or wounded and fell into [the] hands of the enemy when the position gained by the attack was abandoned in the night.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
