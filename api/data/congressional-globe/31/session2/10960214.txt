Having given these several statements of the
expenditures of the respective periods, selected, the
first under a Democratic, and tlie second under
Whig Administration, I will make a few compari-
sons, showing the difference between them:
First: the total cash expenditures for the first
period of three years, commencing July 1, 1845,
and terminating June 30, 1848, under the admin-
istration of Mr. Polk, being the three years of the
war with Mexico, were §138,643,081 09: annual
average, $46,214,360 36.
The actual and estimated expenditures of the
second period, commencing July 1, 1850, and end- i,
ing June 30, 1852, under the administrations of ,!
General Taylor and Mr. Fillmore, being after the 1
elose of the war with Mexico, were $141,217,-
809 37: annual average, $47,072,603 12; exceed-
ing the aggregate expenditures of the first period
$2,574,728 28, and an annual excess over the ex-
penditures of the first period of $858,242 76.
The total expenditures of the first period, ex-
clusive of payments on account of the public debt,
ns I have already shown, were $125,554,356 20— ;
an annual average of $41,851,452 06.
The total expenditures, actual and estimated, for
the second period, exclusive of similar payments,
as already stated, are $128,074,656 32: annua!
average, $42,691,552 10—exceeding- the aggregate
expenditures of the first period $2,520,300 12, ai d t
an annual excess over the annual average expend-
ituies of the first period of $840,100 04.
The total expenditures of the first period, exclu-
sive of payments on account of the public debt,
Mexican hostilities, to volunteers and militia of
States and Territories, increased expenses of the
Army "proper during the war, under the treaty
with Mexico, and expenses of collecting the rev-
enue from customs and from lands, were $71,114,-
610 53: annual average $23,704,870 17—exceeding
tl\e expenditures under the peace establishment for
the year ending with June, 1845, as stated by Mr. t,
Secretary Corwin * only $2,324,817 48.
The expenditures for the second period, exclu-
sive of payments on account of the public debt, and
other items specified in the preceding statement,
actual and estimated for, are $109,241,903 07: an
annual average of $36,413,967 69—exceeding the
aggregate expenditures of the first period $38,127,-
293 56, and exceeding the annual average expend-
itures of the first period $12,709,097 52—being an
increase in the ordinary expenditures of the Gov-
ernment under Whig rule over the expenditures
under a Democratic Administration of more than
fifty per cent. It will require something more
than the ingenious statements and mere charges
to the war with Mexico, to induce the people—the
tax payers of the country—to believe that these
enormous and extravagant expenditures, which
are being made and estimated for under this good
Whig Administration, are right and proper. They
will think that all is not sound in the financial de-
partment of their Government. They will require
reasons for the necessity of such expenditures.
The comparisons which I have been making
were between a Democratic Administration during
a time of war and a Whig Administration during
a time of peace, and I think the result is most
favorable for the former, and will be satisfactory
to every right-thinking and sound patriot whose
only desire is his country's good.
liut I will now compare these Whig expendi-
tures in time of peace, with the Democratic ex-
penditures during the year immediately succeeding
the war. The expenditures of the year ending
June 30, 1849, being the first year after the con-
clusion of peace, were estimated for and appropri-
ated under the Democratic administration of Mr.
Polk, and the first eight months of that year were
under the same Administration.
i The entire expenditures of the year, exclusive
of Treasury notes funded, as already shown, were
$46,798,667 82, being $273,935 30 less than tlie
annual average expenditures under the three years
of the Whig Administration.
The expenditures for the year ending with June
30, 1849, exclusive of payments on account of
the public debt, were $41,178,395 43—being just
$1,513,156 67 less than the annual averasre ex-
penditures of the three years under tlie Whigs.
The expenditures of the year ending June 30,
1849, exclusive of payments on account of the
•public debt, to volunteers and militia of States and
Territories, and of payments made under the pro-
visions of the treaty with Mexico, were $30,218,-
149 93. In this sum is included the entire ex-
penses of the Army proper, the Navy, pensions,
and all othersexcept the items expressly excluded,
and is an increase over the expenditures of 1845
of $8,838,100 57; but at the same time it will be
seen that the expenditures of the year 1849, the
first year after the war and under a Democratic
Administration, were $6,195,817 76 less than the
annual average expenditures under the three years
of Whig financiering. Both, it will be remem-
bered, in time of peace. 1
Mr. Secretary Corwin, being "aware that the |
actual and etfim<Utd expenditures" submitted by him
might "justly be deemed large," thought "proper
' that they be accompanied by such explanations
' and statements as will distinguish the ordinary
' from the extraordinary demands upon the Treas-
' ury, and show that the aggregate is no greater
' than is demanded by a due regard to economy
' and the obligations of the Government." This
he attempts to do by charging all to the Mexican
war and the Democratic party. In this he has
signally failed, as the records of the Department
over which he presides and which have been fur-
nished to Congress and to the country, fully estab-
lish, in the fact that the Democrats administered
the Government the first year after the war for
$6,000,000 less than the sum now estimated for
and required by him, excluding certain items which
I have specified. But it may 6e said that this year
was not a fair test of the necessary expenditures
after the war with Mexico, notwithstanding it was
an increase of nearly $9,000,000 over the peace
establishment expenditures of 1845, as shown by
the Secretary.
I have been comparing the expenditures under
Democratic and under Whig Administrations. I
will now see how the matter stands between
Whigs. The expenditures for the year ending
Juno 30,1850, were estimated for by a Democratic
Administration, but expended under the Whig
administration of President Taylor, and were, ex-
clusive of Treasury notes funded, $39,355,268 6J>;
being only $14,382,278 81 less than the actual and
estimated expenditures for the year ending June
30, 1851—the first year under the administration of
President Fillmore and Mr. Secretary Corwin.
Tlie expenditures of the year ending with June,
1850, tinder President Taylor and Mr. Secretary
Meredith, exclusive of payments on account of
the public debt, Mexican hostilities, volunteers and
militia of States and Territories, under the pro-
visions of the treaty with Mexico, and expenses
of collecting the revenue from customs and the
public lands, were $28,006,592 70; being just
$15,212,793 52 less than Mr. Secretary Corwin
tells us iie will require to carry on the Government
from July 1. 1850, to June 30,1851—the first year
of his financial career. A hopeful commencement,
truly!—which must, upon the principle of the old
saying that " it is an ill wind that blows nobody
good," result beneficially to somebody or other.
Certainly not to the benefit of the tax-payers.
Some persons might, by reading the report of
the Secretary, be misled, and ind need to believe that,
after all, Mr. Corwin is an economist, who will in-
troduce important reforms into the administration
of his Department, and make great reductions in
the public expenditures, from the fact that the ex-
penditures, actual and estimated, as shown for the
year ending June 30, 1851, will be $53,737,547 50,
and the estimates which he submits for the year
ending June 30, 1852, is only $48,124,993 18—be-
ing a reduction of $5,612,554 32 upon the prece-
ding ye"r. But let none be deceived by this seem-
ing sihow of economy and reduction of the public
expenditures. Rather let all remember that, be-
fore the expiration of the fiscal year for which
these appropriations are asked, there will be
seven months of a spss'on of Congress held in
this Capitol, during which time there will doubt-
less be estimates submitted and appropriations
asked to supply deficiencies for the year 1852,
which the implied public faith and the honor of the
country will, in the opinion of a majority, require
immediately, if not sooner, to be passed. Indeed, if
the past is to be taken as a criterion of the future,
the expenditures of the year 1852 will not only
equal those of the year 1851, but will greatly ex-
ceed even the unprecedentedly large expenditures
of that year.
In the Treasury report of December 3, 1849,
Mr. Secretary Meredith submitted aggregate esti-
mates of appropriations for the service of the year
ending June 30, 1851, of $44,997,092 73. Many
applications were made from the various Depart-
ments for increase before the several appropria-
tions were finally passed. Mr. Secretary Corwin
now tells us that all of $53,853,597 50, including
$116,050 of Treasury notes funded, will be ex-
pended during the year-, exceeding tlie estimates,
as originally submitted, $8,856,504 77. Xow,
should the war with Mexico, the acquisition of
territory, and other Democratic enormities, require
the same ratio of increase of the expenditures for
the year 1852, over the estimates submitted, which
Mr. Corwin thinks exists as applicable to the year
1851, the expenditures for the second year of his
administration of the Treasury Department will
approximate $60,000,000.
It does appear to me that there is little or no sys-
tem or fixed principles in making the estimates,
but to estimate foras much as they think Congress
will appropriate, and then expend without regard
to the amount granted, and at the next session
submit estimates and demand appropriations to
supply the deficiencies to pay the debts, redeem
the pledged faith, and sustain the honor of the
Government.
At the last session of Congress there was appro-
priated tor the service of the Indian Department,
$2,355,921 35, for the current year ending with
June next. Estimates are now submitted and ap-
propriations demanded of $1,551,327 66, to supply
deficiencies in this Department for the same year,
We see from an examination of the report of the
Secretary, that the expenditures under the Indian
Department for the year 1850 were $1,516,327 46;
for the year 1851 the expenditures, actual and
estimated, will be $4,514,389 09.
From the report of the Secretary it appears that
from July 1,1850, to September 30, 1850, the ex-
