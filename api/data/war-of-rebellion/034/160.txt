Captain SINCLAIR,

Numbers 7. Report of Brigadier General John H. Morgan, C. S. Army.

LIBERTY, March 21, 1863.

We attacked the enemy at Milton on yesterday morning; drove them 2 miles. They were largely re-enforced, and maintained their position. The fight lasted six hours. Our loss heavy in officers.

The Federals are reported advancing upon us again to-day. If they should, will fight them at this point. Will send a regiment to Lebanon to-day if enemy do not advance.

Colonel [R. M.] Martin, who has just returned from the Murfreesborough and Nashville pike, reports that the Federals are not falling back.

Respectfully,

JOHN H. MORGAN,

Brigadier-General.

Major-General WHEELER.

Numbers 8. Report of Captain J. D. Kirkpatrick, Ward's Ninth Tennessee Cavalry (Confederate).

AUBURN, March 20, 1863.

We have had rather a warm time to-day. Our loss is great; do not know how much yet; perhaps 125 killed and wounded. Do not know the enemy's loss. They were re-enforced with a large force, and we had to fall back. They are not pursuing us.

Yours, very respectfully,

J. D. KIRKPATRICK,

Captain, Commanding Ward's Regiment.

Colonel [D. H.] SMITH.
