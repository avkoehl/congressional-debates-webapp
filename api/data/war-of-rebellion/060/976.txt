You will proceed forthwith with your command from Beverly to Pocahontas County, in the direction of Huntersville, as far as Sulphur Springs, which is northeast of Marlin's Bottom and about 15 miles north of Huntersville. You will rely on what you can find in the country, but will give receipts for everything. Let the impression be given out that a large force is approaching. You will stay in Pocahontas County for two or three days and then return by such route as you may deem best. Acknowledge receipt of this and also report your return.
