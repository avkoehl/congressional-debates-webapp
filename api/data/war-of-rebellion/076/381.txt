views. I forward you an open note to Major-General Sherman, which you will read and will then oblige me by forwarding to him, as I am unable to direct my orderly to his headquarters.* I have the honor to inform you at the same time that, in my opinion, Brigadier General R. W. Johnson is the senior brigadier-general in this corps, and suggest that, until General Sherman shall otherwise direct, all orders for its commanding officer be addressed to him.

Respectfully,

JOHN M. PALMER,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,Near Atlanta, Ga., August 5, 1864--8.30 a. m.

Major General J. M. PALMER,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Will you please inform your division commanders that you are acting under my orders to-day? In an emergency it may be necessary to give them orders directly. I have just heard from General Sherman. He desires us to press vigorously and endeavor to gain a point commanding the railroad to-day, and intrench it.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS FOURTEENTH ARMY CORPS,August 5, 1864.

Major-General SCHOFIELD,

Commanding:

GENERAL: I have informed my division commanders that your orders given them through General Johnson are to be obeyed, and that you command them. I add that I am in good faith conforming for the day to General Sherman's order, and regret that you should have apprehensions that I would do otherwise.

Respectfully,

J. M. PALMER.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE OHIO,In the Field, Ga., August 5, 1864.

Major General J. M. PALMER,

Commanding Fourteenth Army Corps:

GENERAL: Permit me to assure you that I have not had the slightest apprehension as to your sincere intention to carry out General Sherman's orders. My request was based upon the information that General Baird had not been notified of the arrangement for the day, and my apprehension that you might not think to notify him. I simply desire to avoid misapprehension and consequent mistakes.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.
