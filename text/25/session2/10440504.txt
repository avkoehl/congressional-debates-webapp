Bell] as Speaker of this House—a  \ ote w hich I
have never regretted, and under similar circum-
stances, -would with cheeifulness give H again, not   |
doubting that he would preside 01 er our delibeia-
tions with digml)   and  impartially  to   lis  bod),
and honor to himself      The President's  message
came, and I saw in itsgeneial principles my own  ,
principles reflected, and m the  financial policy it |
recommended, the very measure  my  own judg
ment, after mature deliberation at home, had ap
proved       I hesitated not a moment       My couise
was open before me     But I am aware, sir, that it
would be egregious „elf-exaggeration  to suppose
that these charges of political tergiversation are de-
signed for me a'one      They were begun in the    '
other wing of trie Capitol, and are rained on here
to affect others far more w orthy oí public conside-
ration than I can presums to be,   and to break
down that moral influence which a faithful adhe-
rence to principles must ever command    I propose
very briefly to show that the measure before you,
separating the Government from all connection
■vith the banks or the capital of the country, is a
State Rights measure, and that the State Rights
party, unless they were prepared to abandon their
principles, could not have acted otherwise than
they have done—support it
At tl  commencement of this Government, i vo  ||
great parties rose, as to the policy of its admins   I
tration—the Federal and Republican parties    The  I
one, fearing that it was too weak—the  other, that
it was too strong       The one, striving by construe-  ,
tion, to add to its poweis—the other, insisting that
it should be kept withm the powers plainly grant-  |
ed by the Constitution      The one, endeavoring to
build up  and strengthen the  Federal head—die
other, leaning to the support of the reseived  rights    ¡
of the States     The one, claiming jurisdiction over
sectional interests—the other, limiting  its legisla-
tion to those interests common and general to the
whola confederacy     Now, sir, if the  measure be-
fore you, is not a Republican  State Rights mea
sure, according to these great principles, I am pre-
pared to abandon it
In the first place, is the bih on j our table,  pro-
posing to collect eventually the  revenueo of this
Government in the constitutional <urrenc\, by lis
own agents, plainly constitutional, ivithtut the aid   I
of construction to siipp; it it?   This is admitted by   i
all       It   is opposed  onlj   on g ourds  of  expe-
diency    But how lsitwitnthc alternative to this   I
bill—a   United Slates   Bank'      Is that measure
plainly constitutional, witnout the aid of consuus-
tión to support it?   Why, h lives by construction
alone, formerly, from the revenue power, and latterly,   |
from the commercial power   When first proposed   j
by Alexander Hamilton, n  1792, it was opposed
by Mr Jefferson, and the whole Republican partv   !
of that day, expressly  on the ground of its uncon-   '
stitutionahty      In fact, it was the first great mea-
sure on which the Federal and Republican parties    j
divided    It has been vetoed by two Piesidenls on    '
constitutional grounds, and, altnough sanctioned by
Mr Malison and the republican party in 1316, it
was not a Republican, but a Federal  mepsure,
supported solely on the ground of necessity, from
the peculiar  situation  of the   country,  deranged,
embarrassed, and  exhausted by tl e late war    In
the second place, will  the bill tend  to strengthen
thi  Government, ihe Federal head1  I shall not it-
tempt to refute  what is of couise irrefutable, the
wild declamation on this subject, against the in-
creased power, it is affirmed, the bill will give to
the Executive authority     This bill proposes but
nine additional officers, and unless gentlemen can
show that hundreds have the  political weight of
millions, and that individuals are ?s powerful as
banks, it is useless to declaim upon the subjtct    It
is the result of an ignorance of official details, to  ,
suppose that the control of the President over the
money in the Treasury will be greater when the
money is kept by officers oi the Treasury, than
when it is deposited wiih banks    In either case,
the money can only be drawn by a warrant of the
Comptroller, countersigned  by  the   Secretary or
the Treasury, on which the cheek of iheTieasmer
issues, and  which could as  easily  be obtained, il
these officers are < onnpi, when the   money   is de-
posited with banks, as in the hands ot ofhoers  The

depository, in either case, will only look to the
authenticity of the draft, and will know nothing
and care nothing of tne application of the funds
But compare th° bill in this respect, with its alter-
natn e—a United Stat-^s Bank, of fifty millions of
dollars, stationed at the centre place of commerce,
witn branches in every State of the Union Who
shall measure the political power of such an insti-
tution, a sociated with the Executive of this Go
vernment? When the late President of the Uni
ted States Bank was asked by the committee of
this Hou e, whether, by the power of that institu-
tion, he could crush any of the State banks m the
Union, he answered in the affirmative And what
better proof do we need of the truth of this opinion
than the power that bank has displaced in its late
contest with tms Government, which no influence
couli hate resisted, but that of tne late President of
the United States, with a popularity unsuipassed in
thehistorj of this Governm°nt, and an energy of
will but mely equalled in the historj of men? The
late of th it bank will be a lesson to any future in-
stitution }ou mat establish, -which will not be in
vain Banks and capital are the natural allies of
Government Hereafter, they will move on har-
moniously together under this Government, the
one strengthening the other, in all their projects of
aggrandisement, and if the liberties of the country
shall suswve their coalition a few jea>-s, it will not
be oe-ause  hey cannot be annihilated In the last
plac , what is iIip sectional operation of this bill1
It propeses, by collecting the revenues of the Go
venmeniii the constitutional currency, to leave
ah the seUions of the Union to the f-li enjoyment
of their natural advantages, under the operation of
the geneial laws uf commerce Will this be so,
under the operation of a United States Bank1 Such
a bank will be able to control the exchanges all over
tne Union, and by appreeiaungor depreciating them,
force Ihetide of commerce into those channels it
shall desne to faior Wheiet°r it is located will
be the centre place of credit and by the superior
means of commercial accommodation it will af-
ford, from its own great resources, and the credit
of the Government it will tend to centralize the
whol  commerce ol the Union and destroy that of
the weaker sections Thus, sir, if I am correct m
inj iipw? of the political and commeicial tendency
of this bill, it is strictly a St i e Rights measure It
is clearly constitutional, without the aid of con-
struction to support it It does not tend to strength-
en the Federal Qo\ ernment at the expense of the
States It does not operate partially on the differ-
e-it sections of the Union
But there is another reasor, Mr Chairman, wny
the Sia'e Rights party should suppoit this bill,
which, to every candid mind, ought to shield them
from the least imputation oi change in purposes,
or abandonment of principles It is emphati-
cally tneii measuie When, m 1836, the em-
ployment of the State banks to cany on the
fiscal operations of the Government, was pro-
posed as a substitute foi the United States Bank,
the State Rights party, brought forward as their
msasuie, Mr Gordon's bill, which provided for a
separation of the Government fiom the banks, and
the ccllection of its revenues in ihe constitutional
currencj The Administration party was then op-
posed to the measure—they row support it Can
gentlemen suppose us so lost to all sense of duty
and piopnety, as to ?ct upon the mere principle of
stupid pa ty ha red, and oppose our own measures
and principles, becarse others agree with them? I
put it to every honorable nan who hears me, how
could we have done otherv ise than support this
bill' Suppose that it did throw us, as the gentle-
man from Missi wppi says, in alliance with a
"corrupt Administration,"—what then' Do our
punciples depend on the corruption of others?
Hav e he and his associates ever esteemed us so
low, as to suppose that we would oppose any Ad-
mimstrat on oe this Government, whether its mea-
sures were good or bad, without ati> regard to the
welfare of the peop'e or the principies of the Con-
stiti uon? And wnat does h  mean by a "corrupt
\dministration?" Does he mean the useless and
extravagant sectional appropriations made on this
floor' Why, his Northern allies are always the
chiet instruments in. all such legislation     Does he

mean any thing more than a party distribution of
the offices ot the Government—the spoils'? And is
it for so poor and contemptible a purpose, to divert
the spoils into another (if you please, a better)
channel, or to enjoy them, that any man worthy of
the confidence of the people, would be justified, ui
the peculiar position in which the Suufh is placed,
in paltering wi'h his principles, or in abandoning
hers? Since the gentleman rebukes us for oar
"allies," he will surely pardon the inquiry, who
are his? A State Rights Southern man himself,
he co-operates with those w ho are mortally op-
posed to every political or constitutional principle
which the South deejis necessary to her interests
and safety There stand by his side all the con-
sohdatiomsts and Federalists from the whole
Union—the Bank, the Tariff, Internal Improve-
ment, high taxes, piofuse expenditure, surplus
revenue, advocates , and close to his shoulder, the
Spartan phalanx of the Whigs—the fraternal
South loving sixly-four, who maintain the new
doctrine of the right of petition, by which jurisdic-
tion over oui domestic institutions is attempted to
be usurped , and the still more affectionate thirty-
six, who but da> before yesterday voted that the
Speaker had no right to call the gentleman from
Massachusetts [Mr Adams] to order, for maintain-
ing and arguing on this floor, that Congress had a
ngh1 to receive and act upon petitions from oar
own slaves against their masters Sir, if I was to
choose my allies, without any regard to political
principles, I tell the gentleman from Mississippi I
should be sorry to find myself m his position. I
know that he is no Abohtioms , and that a large
portion of the Whig party are no Abolitionists.
To make such a charge against them, would be a
great wrong to them, and ajstill greater to myself:
but the Abolitionists aie unquestionably his allies,*
as is shown not only by the votes on your jour-
nals to which I have adverted, but by the late le-
gislative proceedings of Massachusetts, New York,
Pennsy'vania, and Connecticut, in relation to sla-
very The Whigs voted en masse for the resolu-
tions passed on that subject, by the Legislatures of
these States, and the supporters of the Administra-
tion, to a man, I understand, voted against them.
It may be that but little is to be obtained for the
South from this Administration, as the gentleman
from Mississippi strongly prophewes, but what can
the South possibly gam from the gentleman's allies?
And when he shall have succeeded m bringing
them into power, with all their principles and po-
licy, by which the jurisdiction and powers of this
Government shall be enlarged, and all those bar-
riers of the Constitution, upon which the South re-
lies for protection, short of revolution, shall be
thrown down—on him, and the other Southern
gentlemen who shall aid in the achievement, will
rest the responsibility of evil to the South I pre-
fer, sir, my position—co-operating on the great
measure before you with those who uphold the
Administration, amongst whom alone I find any
congeniality with my political principles The
gentleman from Massachusetts [Mr. Adams] per-
ceives this, and therefore a few days since de-
nounced the President of the United Stales as a
JV'orifte  n man with Southern principles t For this
reason he opposes—he de ests the Administration
la it for the same reason that Southern gentlemen
co operate with him for its overthrow? The gen-
tleman from Massachusetts surely thinks so, and
hence his endless invectives every morning against
Texas and slavery, for the special gratification and
encouragement of his Southern associates Sir, I
prefer my position—identified with neither the
Whig nor the Administration party, but prepared
to act zealously with either, whenever they support
those measures and principles upon which I believe
bee the address of the Republican party in Congress, lately
put forth by the members of Congress.
tThe following aie Mr Abams s words as contained in hu
speech published in the Intelligencer, speaking of the admis
sion of Texas into the I^nion 'Now that this is a question be
tween the free and the slav8 States, I believe no owe can have
am doubt at all That it is a question peculiarly interesting to
the piesent Administration, which is understood «Towedly,
boa^un^ty and openly, to be the Administration of a Northern
man with Southern principles, there can be no doubt This is
ihe combination of the committee, a sectional combination of
ínteres!  of the slareholding against the free States, and an Ad
ministration combination of a Northern Administration Wttl
