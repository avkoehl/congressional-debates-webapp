attacking them if the ground be favorable. 8.15 sent Garrard instructions to send out the scouts, &amp;c., in accordance with the above order. Garrard is now commanding a division of cavalry, and is on our left, operating under directions of General Stanely. the Fourth Corps and Garrard's cavalry division constitute now the left of Sherman's grand army and of the Army of the Cumberland. 9.15 a. m., received General Sherman's telegraphic orders for the day (to-day) as follows:*

10 a. m., official copies of the foregoing orders of Generals Sherman and Thomas sent to division commanders for their information and guidance. 12.30 p. m., received dispatch from General Sherman, dated Utoy Creek, saying that Schofield's and Palmer's troops were crossing Utoy Creek and moving toward Sandtown road, and that he is on the hill this side of Utoy Creek, above Herring's Mill. 5 p. m., heavy firing heard off in the direction of Schofield's and Palmer's troops. The enemy is moving two small regiments in front of our left, behind his breast-works, one to our right and the other to our left, the only movements of his troops that have been discovered thus far. 7.40 p. m., General Grose reports that his lookout reports that two columns of the enemy's troops are moving from our left toward the town. At once sent this information to department headquarters. 8 p. m., have been informed that Schofield and Palmer did not effect much to-day; they did not move in time, or rather did not get far enough; are some distance from the railroad yet; they will move out again early in the morning. Unusually quiet along our front to-day; but little firing from either side. Day clear and very warm.

August 5.-7.30 a. m., received dispatch from General Thomas, stating--

The indications are that Major-Generals Schofield and Palmer are engaged with the enemy, as the musketry can be heard. Observe closely the indications of the battle, and should our troops advance upon the town, be prepared to take advantage of such movement.

12.40 p. m., received dispatch from General Thomas, saying that Schofield is heavily engaging the enemy; to watch them closely in our front, and to take advantage of any attempt that they may make to withdraw therefrom;the threaten along our lien, &c. 12.55 p. m., in accordance with these instructions, at once sent word to division commanders to strengthen their skirmish lines, open fire, and make a general demonstration. Orders were also sent for all the batteries of the Artillery Brigade of the corps to fire upon the enemy's works with solid shot. 3 p. m., our re-enforced skirmish line advanced from the whole of the corps front. The enemy were driven from their rifle-pits in front of Grose's division. No attempt worthy of mention was made to drive them from their rifle-pits elsewhere. The enemy in Wood's front opened a heavy artillery and musketeer fire from their main works; also in Newton's front. In General Grose's front we received a very heavy fire from the enemy's main works, and from a heavy out-work abut 100 yards in advance of the same. Our main line of troops was now brought out of our works, as though we were about to make a general advance, and moved forward a short distance to places of cover, where they remained until they, with the skirmishers from the advanced position they gained to-day, were withdrawn after dark. At 5 p. m. Colonel Smith's regiment, Thirty-first Indiana (First Division), was sent out
