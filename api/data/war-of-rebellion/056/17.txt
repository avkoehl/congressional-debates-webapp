Maj. Gen. H. W. HALLECK,

General-in-Chief:

I have nothing to report to-day, except that the enemy fired a few shots into our intrenchments, doing no harm. The railroad and steam-boats are beginning to work properly, and I hope to have sufficient rations in a few days. We shall need more motive power to enable us to get forage and quartermaster's and ordnance stores sufficient for the wants of this army.

Major-General.

Has a brigade of the Fourth Corps from Shellmound arrived at Bridgeport? If not, send a force to destroy the road at Moore's Gap, near Moore's Spring; also the road near Island Creek-both roads will be easily made impassable. Citizens can give you information.
