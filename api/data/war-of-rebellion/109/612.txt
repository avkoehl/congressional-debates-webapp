General SHERMAN:

GENERAL: I have been to the Rough and Ready and Jonesborough road with about ten men. While waiting for Baird to come up we saw squads of men passing along a road about three-quarters of a mile north of east of my position. Five miles north of Jonesborough, at Mrs. Smith's, our party captured about a dozen stragglers, the tenor of whose information is that Hardee and Lee (S. D.) have passed on to Jonesborough, leaving Stewart and Walthall in Atlanta.
