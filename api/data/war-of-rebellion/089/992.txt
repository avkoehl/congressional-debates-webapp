Lieutenant Colonel EDWARD W. SMITH,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Dept. of Va. and N. C.:

COLONEL: I respectfully apply for the return to duty with their respective regiments of all officers and enlisted men of this command now on detached service with the Twenty-fifth Army Corps. I am well aware that it is a matter of necessity that details should be made from the white troops for certain duties in that corps, but I respectfully suggest that the interests of the service would be promoted by making them from the troops in garrison in this department rather than from the active army in the field.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

ALF. H. TERRY,

Brevet Major-General, Commanding.

This order will not be constructed to interfere with the instructions of the chief of artillery to the artillery in the redoubts.
