27th Cong—1st Sess.                                        Fiscal Bank—Mr. Payne.                                                         H. of Reps.
But, Mr.  President, the Senator from Georgia
[Mr BekbienJ"interposes anothei objection to my
amendment, which I  admit to be plausible.    He
object to it because it excludes from the operation
of the bankrupt law those bank  owned wholly or
in part by States.    He  maintains  that there will
be a want of "uniformity" in the law     I concede
to this objection all its weight; but it must be re-
membered that the bill itself wan's the principle of
"uniformity."    This is manifest,   from  the very
fact ihat corpoiations are not included in its provi-
sions     I  apprehend, however,  that by the "uni
formiiy" of a bankrupt law, we are to understand
its unilorm application to, and operation on such
classes of person*, as shall be embraced within its
provision*, and that to be ' uniform," it must ex
tend a'ike to all of a class embrace !, in every por-
tion of the Union.   Upon this principle my amend-
ment is not obnoxious to the objection urged by the
Senator ircm Georgia, [Vlr. Bkrrie j ]   It selects
one c a«s of incorporated bankers, and subjects all
of that class to the same provisions, v hilst it ex-
cludes ail of another class of incorporated b<m iers,
and leaves them to the exis'irg  lttws.    1 have al
ready sia ed to tie Senate my reason for confining
my amendment to tnat cía s of banks  owned en-
t rely b/ individuals    There are a few States in
which there are incorporated banks owned wholly
or in part by the S'ate«.   Some of my friends on
this side of ibe  Senate are aveise to subjecting
such banks to a bank.upt law.    I have yielded to
their wishes in eicloang such banks from the ope-
ration of my amendment.   This can have btr Utile
influence,  as the  batiks of that class are 'ew in
number, and as tl ej must nece sanly conforii in
their policy to itie course pursued by the gieat body
of the bank ng ins nutiou> with which they are in
timately connected     If al1  the banks owned en
'irely by >ndivictuals are forced by the provisions
of a bankrupt ¡aw to lawa- and tontmue specie
pay men  , Í   hvi.no fed is but ihat tbo*e batik 
owned v holly or in part by the States, will be com-
pelled either to pui uc the same policy, or to cease
to exist.
I cLem it pr per here to state, Mr Pre idect,
that I entertain no aoubts myseli as to tne power
of Congress to extend the provisions of a bankiupt
law to hose b<snks owned by a S ate I take it to
be a se'tlf1 prmcip e in he courts, ihat whenever
a Statu engages in t adi of any kind either by cre-
atmg A corporation to rwnags h^r own funds, or
by entenr g it. to a partner hi v,ith individuals
in trade, the St. te tnereby divests herself
to that extent of h r sovereign ch rar-lei,
and places hereof uoon a level with individual
traders So long as this doctrine shall prevail, I
can see no reason for the opinion entertained by
some that such corporations are beyond the bank-
rupt po v^r of Congress In t^ose corporations

aad uniform < urr ¡ cy, by imposing the necessary
restf.enous on then bmkipg institutions This po
sition «ill be disp xtea by none. I am further sa-
tisfied * r Fre"i< ent, that the States cannot apply
the necessary remedy for tne existing evils of oar
loeal cartencies This inability arises from the
vast extent of our territory, the   immense number
of local banks, and the groat number of indepen-
dent States, whose legislation must concur to se-
cure the beneS sof un'formity and stability m the
local currencies. The banks of different States are
int ma ely connected with each other in their inte-
iists, and in many cases dirtu'y dependent one
upon another for the po'iry wh.cb they ate to pur-
sue. Yet the different banks, so connected and de-
pendent, are situated in different States, controlled
by different Legislatmes, and of'e-i pursuing a dif-
ferent line of policy as to their banks In
this state ot things, with twenty six sovereign
States, acitig independently of each other, with
nea'iy a thousird banks issuing different turren
cíes, and spread over an immense territory of coun-
try, I hold it to be utterly impracticable tor all the
Stale Banks to be subjecu d to uniform restnc
tions by the Sute L'gtsla ures Which tf the
States is to b°gtn this restrictive reformation'! New
York, Massachusets, and Maine have set the ex-
ample, and have reaped the benefits ot their
v.ise restricting bat in the Sourt, West,
Southwest and Is orth; est, _o far from following
their examples, the State Legislatures have acqui-
esced in the ixr-t'rg susp-nsinns, and have made
no efforis to conect existing aouses I ask, Mr
Pres dent, it it is. the \ art of wisdom for Us to with- \
hold th<. exercise of <i poner of admiued efficacy

a' ihe t me „f granting it, lot if th* f-anks.aH it
any time s^p^nd specie payments, the charter
shall be forfeited and its effects be placd m the
hands of i ommi sioneis or ' qu nation It is
eleai!y compe er.t xor a State Le«ishiint to d)
mis at the tin o creating the corporation, bui n is
f<.r Homifiigceuairi that after a <ha ter has been
g jinted, the Lcgis ature can then annex ^uch a
condition to the ctaaiter. This must depend upon
the question, whether ¿ suspension ci specie pay-
ments by a State bank is such a violntion of its
charter as may be adjudged eaiise of forfeituie
If such violation would be adjudged a forfeiture
of the charteied privileges, then it certainly would
be competent for the Legislatute at any time to
enact a law fixing the remedy for carrying oat the
forfeiture    But upon the supposition that a sus-
pension is not a cause of forfeiture, it is equally
clear that the Legislature of a Siate could not an-
nex a condition not originally contained m the
charier.   Th s, I had occasion to sta'e a few days
since, was an unsettled question, an i therefore it
is far from being certain that the State Legislatures
have the power to apply  the bankrupt principle to
their banks already in existence.   No such exer-
cise of power has been brought to my knowledge.
The States of New York and Mame, rapas ing their
bankiupt law , did not  make  them applicable to
existing banks, but to those which ihey were then
creating, or which should be thereafter created   But
no suih difficulty exists as to the exercise of the bank-
rupt power by this Government    V can be made
to operate as well on  existing banks as on those
which may hereafter be crested    The exercise of
this porfer,  however, by the States, as to existing
banks, is involved in much doubt and uncertainty.
It has been said, Mr. President, by the Senator
from Arkansas, [Mi Sevier,] that the adoption of
this proposition at the present time would greatly
increase the existing embarrassments of the coun-
try.     I   acknowledge  the force of  this remark,
and undrr its influence at the last s-ssion, I avow-
ed my determination to vote ag&mst a similar pro*
po i ion.    But, sir, in the amendment whfh I have
r<adtothe  Senan", I hav    p-oviJed against the
consfquences to which k>¡   nend from Arkansas
loo s.   I pr pose thit rtiis provision as to banks
shall take effect on ihe l,t day of Julv, 1842.   I
cannol'for a moment siipp sj thai any Senator ex-
pec s the  banks to conunn>   m a suspended state
until that time    The great obstacle to ie-.umption
in the South rod WeM, is ro* removed.    I allude
to ire   la'e  U uted  Siat s  Bank     In  its present
po verle1-  co idition it can no longer be tormidable
to those banjfi. m the South  and West which have
heretofore ext u ed  their own su«pensions by re-
ference u  the example of tha' bank    I  believe
thai trie  Soutiern and Western banks are prepar-
irgfor a resumption, ?nd  tnat beftre  the 1st of
Julv, 1842   those which art solvent will be paying
specie.    The friends of ih.4 Fiscal Bank must cal-
culate on a re-umpiion by the Sute bjnks at least
as early as tl e spring of 1842    They  propose to
put th^ir great regu'ator in operation at that time,
! a"d they cermnly anticipate a general resumption
b} Lie State  banks    Unless, then, Mr President,
uearegreatl) mis'aken 10  oir calculations as Ui
uie course of the State banks, my amendment wilt
oav<> no influence in causing those  banks to in-
crease the existing pressure, by adopting too ng.d
a po'icy m their curtailments
1 hau no expectation, Mr President, that I
should find it necessary to ad 1 an; thiog to the few
ie¡narks n ii< h I made upon offering the amend-
ment What I have now satu has been confined
