Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON, Secretary of War.

DEAR SIR: In reply to yours of 4th instant relative to John Carfoot I have the honor to report that the said John Carfoot was arrested near New Berne, N. C., by Captain Boothe in April, 1862, and sent to Salisbury, N. C., by General Ransom. The inclosed letter, a copy of one addressed to the Adjutant-General and the original of which is on file in the Adjutant-General's Office, will explain the nature of the charges against him. He was discharged on the 3rd day of January, 1863, and I am informed he is now at work in Salisbury, N. C., having taken the oath of allegiance to the Confederate States. I also inclose an extract* from a letter to the British consul notifying him of Carfoot's release. I am under the impression the former inquiry came through the Adjutant-General's Department and hence the reference was addressed to that office.

I am, respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN H. WINDER,

Brigadier-General.

[Sub-inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF HENRICO,Richmond, January 14, 1863.
