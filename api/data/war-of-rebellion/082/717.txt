ing siege battery near Warren's headquarters, to take charge of the train. Have the guns prepared for moving, and, if possible, send them off before dark. If not, do it as early as possible to-night. I send six eight-mule teams for the guns and eight wagons for the ammunition and implements, supposing that there are about 400 rounds on hand.

Do not start without a guide that knows the way.
