which he managed his battery, fully supporting the high opinion I had formed of his merits.

Captain Brockenbrough brought his battery into action at a later moment and handled it with energy and effect.

The brilliant service rendered by Taylor's brigade, being immediately under the direction of the commanding general, is not included in my report of the operations.

Except the Maryland regiment and the cavalry, the attack on the east of the town was made by the troops of General Trimble's brigade-the Seventh. I am indebted to that officer on more than one occasion for valuable counsel and suggestion.

The Eighth Brigade, General Taylor leading, had the fortune to be so posted as to make a charge, which closed the action.

My personal staff consisted of Lieutenant Colonel J. M. Jones and Major James Barbour, of the Adjutant-General's Department, and Lieuts. G. Campbell Brown and T. T. Turner, aides. These officers performed all the duties required with coolness and efficiency. Captain Powhatan Robinson and Lieutenant J. Innis Randolph, topographical engineers, and Major Snodgrass, Quartermaster's Department, were also on the field.

Above all I was struck by the uncomplaining endurance of the men, marching and fighting almost incessantly for three days without a murmur, willing to endure to the limit of human power, and only asking to come up to the enemy.

I inclose a report of the killed and wounded, except of the cavalry, which I have not been able to procure. I inclose reports of Brigadier-Generals Trimble and Taylor.

Respectfully,

R. S. EWELL, Major-General.

Major R. L. DABNEY, Asst. Adjt. General, Department of the Valley.
