Ordered, That the conferees on the part of the

The VICE PRESIDENT appointed Mr.
Sprague, Mr. Edmunds, and Mr. Stevenson.
Mr. EDMUNDS. The Chair probably had
forgotten in appointing me on the conference
committee upon the fortification bill that 1 am
not now a member of the Committee on Appro-
priations ; and as I am not at all familiar with
that matter, I ask to be excused from service
on the conference committee.
Mr. SPRAGUE. There is but one point
that is really in difference between the two
Houses on the fortification bill, and it is one
on which the Senator from Vermont has taken
decided ground. I trust that he will not be

kansas senatorial election.
Mr. POMEROY. I should like to occupy
a moment in a personal explanation this morn-
ing, if petitions are concluded.
The VICE PRESIDENT. Petitions are
concluded. The Senator from Kansas asks
consent to make a personal explanation. Is
there objection? The Chair hears none.
Mr. POMEROY. Mr. President, I embrace
the first opportunity, after being able to reach
my seat in the Seuate, to arrest for a moment
the business of the session in order to make a
statement, personal in its general character to
myself, and one which in justice is due also to
the members of this body, with whom I have
so long been associated.
Senators as individuals, as well as the coun-
try, have had their attention called through
the press to the late senatorial election in
Kansas, and have had some information of the
conspiracy there, planned, plotted, and exe-
cuted for the purpose of accomplishing my
defeat. Upon the subject-matter of that act
of villainy, unparalleled in wickedness, my lips
have heretofore been sealed, for the want of a
proper place and opportunity to speak. I
now propose to break this silence.
In your presence, sir; in the presence of
my fellow-Senators, and before the country, I
publicly deny the truth of each and every
charge of bribery and corruption made by the
chief instigator of this conspiracy, or by whom-
soever made. I deny each and every state-
ment imputing to me any act inconsistent with
moral rectitude and correct conduct, and
declare all such statements to be totally,
absolutely, and wickedly false.
And I further specifically deny that I ever
entered into any contract or argreement,
directly or indirectly, with any man (a mem-
ber of the Kansas Legislature or not) for a
vote in my lavor, or that 1 ever, directly or
indirectly, paid any individual one dollar, or
any other sum, for his vote for mi; m the lute
senatorial election.
I know the pressure of public business, and
