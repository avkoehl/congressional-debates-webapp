Question by General MCDOWELL. What command have you held under General McDowell? When did you come under his command? In what condition was the brigade when you first joined it?

Answer. I commanded a brigade under General McDowell. I came under his command on the 1st of last May. The general condition of the brigade was good.

Question by General MCDOWELL. How was it as to means of transportation, and camp equipage when you joined it?

Answer. The means of transportation and the amount of camp equipage were very abundant; unusually so.

Question by General MCDOWELL. What reduction was made in the means of transportation and in the camp equipage on your coming under General McDowell's immediate command at Fredericksburg?

Answer. The number of wagons to each regiment was reduced to seven or eight, I think. The Sibley tents, with which the command were furnished, were changed to shelter-tents; officers' baggage was necessarily considerably reduced, and the baggage of company messes, and baggage generally of officers and men.

Question by General MCDOWELL. Do you know if the reduction of means of transportation and camp equipage was the cause of any feeling or the subject of any remark in the brigade?

Answer. It was the cause of considerable feeling and of many remarks of ill-feeling or ill-will toward General McDowell by officers and men. I did not hear the remarks of the men, but am satisfied remarks of the kind were made.

Question by General MCDOWELL. State if you know of another cause of ill-feeling toward General McDowell or dissatisfaction with him in that brigade connected with their having been under another department commander, where these restrictions had not been made.
