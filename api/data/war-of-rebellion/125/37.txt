such credits, and hence returned to a strict compliance with the law in this matter; and where the State had a surplus I divided that among the districts pro rat a with their enrollment, and then in each district divided again the surplus assigned to it among its sub-districts, and I think this is the only practicable method of adjusting the accounts for men furnished prior to entering upon the enrollment act. Since the last call our orders are to keep a record by the mustering roll of where every mains to be credited,and for the present and the future there should be not trouble if our officers are careful in crediting each locality with its men; but I don"t believe the same rule can be applied to the past, and the law does not require that it should be. There is no doubt that it would be more just and satisfactory if it could be done. I feel sure I cannot.

I am, sir, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
