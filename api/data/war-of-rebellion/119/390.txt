declines now to order the changes proposed. Your prison fund is getting to be very large, and I would suggest that in future in stead of converging the savings in to money the commissary simply give a memorandum receipt for the articles to show that they are in his hands, and he can pay for them from time to time as it may

become necessary. The letter of General Morgan and other prisoners may be sent direct to General Meredith, commissioner for exchange of prisoners, at Fort Monroe, but they should be carefully scrutinized before mailing to see that they are of character, relating only to domestic affairs, not too long nor too frequent.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissioner-General of Prisoners.

Brigadier General G. MARSTON,

Commanding Depot of Prisoners, Point Lookout, Md.:

GENERAL: Your plans and estimates for barracks at Point Lookout have been submitted to the Secretary of War for his approval, but he declines at this time to order the barracks constructed. It will therefore, be necessary to have on hand a supply of tents to meet any unexpected arrival of prisoners, and I have, therefore to request you will make requisition for sufficient tents, with what you have on hand to accommodate 10,000 prisoners. Kitchens will also have to be provided, but these may be built with the prison fund. Locate them in such away that if here after barracks are erected they will be in convenient position. Your letter without date in reference to rolls is received, My object is to obtain the rolls of prisoners received at the earliest day practicable consistent with accuracy. Copies of the roll received, with explanations of errors in names, so that all records may be corrected, is what I require. If an entire new roll is made I will not be able to compare your rolls with those I have already received as there will be two names for the same man, which it will not be possible to detect.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary-General of Prisoners.

Colonel C. V. DE LAND,

Commanding Camp Douglas, Chicago, Ill.:

COLONEL: The Secretary of War will not now order the reconstruction of the barracks at Camp Douglas, which were burned down last winter. No more prisoners will be ordered there and it is probable 1,000 will be transferred to the new depot at Rock Island in a few days.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry and Commissary - General of Prisoners.
