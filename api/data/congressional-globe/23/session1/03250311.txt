Thursday, -fyn' 17, 1834
Several messages weie received from the Presi-
dent of the United Spates, by Mi   Donelson, his
Private Secietaiy, among them the following
PROTEST
To the Senate of the United Statee
It appears by the pub'ished Journal of the Sen
ate that on the 16th of Decembei last a resolution
wasoffeied by a membei  of the Sena'e, which,
after protracted debate, wis, on the 28th day of
1 Maioh last,modified by themovei,and passed by
the votes of twenty-six Senators out of forty-six ,*
who were present and voted, in the following
words, viz
" Resolved, That the President, m the late Ex-
I ' ecutive proceedings m relation to the public rev-
' enue, has assumed upon himself authority and
' power not conferred by the Constitution and
I * laws, but in derogation of both "
j Havmg had the honor, through the voluntary
suffrages of the American people, to fill the office
of President of the United States during the period
which may be presumed to have been referred to
in this resolution, it is sufficiently evident that the
censure it mflictswas intended for myself. With-
out notice, unheard and untried, I thus find myself
charged on the records of the Senate, and in a form
hitheito unknown in oui history, with the high
crime of violating the laws and Constitution of my
country
It can seldom be necessary for any department
of tne Government, when assailed in conversation
or debate, or by the strictures of the press or of
popular assemblies, to step out of its ordinary path
foi the purpose of vindicating its conduct, or of
pointing out any irregularity or injustice mtheman-
nei of the attack But when the chief Executive
Magistrate is by one of the most important branches
of the Government, m its official capacity, in apab-
ile manner, and by its recorded sentence, but with-
out precedent, competent authority, 01 just cause,
declared guilty of a breach of the laws and Consti-
tution, it is due to his station, to public opinion,
and to a proper self respect, that the officer thus
denounced should promptly expose the wrong
which has been done
I In the present case, moreover, there is even a
stio ige* necessity for such a vindication By an
express provision of the Constitution, oefore the
Piesident of the United States can enter on the
execution of his office, he is required to take an
oath or affirmation 111 the following words
" 1 do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I will
' faitnfuliy execute the office of Piesident of the
' Ui ited States, and will, to the best of my ability,
1 preserve, protect, and defend, the Constitution of
1 the United States "
The duty of defending, so far as in him lies, the
integrity of tlffe Constitution, would indeed have
j  resulted from the very nature of Jus office, but by
thus expressing it in the official oath or affirma-
1  tion, which, in this respect, differs from that of
every other functionary, the founders of our Re
I public have attested their sense of its importance,
and have given to it a peculiar solemnity and
force Bound to the performance of this duty by
the oath I have taken, by the strongest obligations
of gratitude to the American people, and by the
I ties which unite my every earthly interest with
I the welfare and glory of my country, and perfectly
convinced that the discussion and passage of the
abovementioned resolution were not only unau-
1 thonzed by the Constitution, but in manyiespects
repugnant to its piovisions, and subversive of the
lights secuied by it to other coordinate depart-
ment , I deem it an imperative duty to maintain
the supremacy of that sacred instrument, and the
immunities of the department intrusted to my
ceie, by all means consistent with my own lawful
powers, with the rights of otheis, and with the
genius of our civil institutions To this end, I have
caused this, my solemn protest against the aforesaid
pioceedmgs, to be placeo on the files of the ex-
eoum e department, and to be transmitted to the
Senate
It is alike due to the subject, the Senate, and the
people, that the views which I have taken of the
proceedings >eferred to, and which compel me to
regard them in the light that has been mentioned,
should be exhibited at length, and with the free-
