death of horace grbelky.
Mr. DAWES. Mr. Speaker, I think all
will concur in the propriety of a public re-
cognition of an event so impressive, and so
without a parallel in the history of this coun-
try, as that which has recently transpired ; and
I therefore deem it proper to offer the follow-
ing resolution:
Resolved by the Senate and Bout* of Repreienta-
tivet, (the Senate concurring,) That in view of the
recent death of Horaoe Greeley, for whom at tho
late election more than three million votes were
cast for President, a record be made in the Journals
of Congress of appreciation for the eminent services
and porsonal purity and worth of the deceased, and
of the sad impression created by his death following
keen family bereavement.
Mr. COX. I have been requested by friends
upon both sides of the House to add one word
to the resolution of condolence and sympa-
thy which has been offered by my honorable
friend from Massachusetts.
I have the honor, sir, to reside in that
part of the city of New York which was once
represented by Mr. Greeley in the Federal
Congress. It might be proper, however,
for others, who knew him more intimately
than I do, to speak of his merits, as no
doubt they will be spoken of hereafter. His
death was unexpected. It has struck the
American people as a most tragic event, in
almost every relation in which we consider it.
Mr. Greeley left his impress upon the Ameri-
can people, not only by his vehement, earnest,
and honest mode of expression, and by the
independence and courage of his thought, but
also by his enlarged benevolence and practical
charity. There is one class of our population
who will never forget him—the poor and be-
reaved. They will remember him, long after
most of us shall have been forgotten.
Mr. Speaker, the United States of America,
by their Representatives here assembled, owe
it to their constituents, as well as to the dis-
tinguished deceased, that some proper and cor-
dial recognition be made of this great leader.
They owe this obligation—not only because
Mr. Greeley was once a member of this House,
but because he left his impress strongly on the
minds of our people. We should testify, even
outside of ordinary precedent, our regard for
| his character and life, and the various quali-
j ties by which he was distinguished. Our sym-
pathy should go forth from this Chamber for
the bereaved and stricken family whom he has
! left behind him. And it is especially proper,
I I think, that such a resolution should come
from gentlemen upon the opposite side of this
Chamber, with whom he had so often con-
ferred and who knew him and the great por-
tion of his political service so well.
The last of Mr. Greeley's days, if I may be
allowed so to express myself, have been sil-
vered o'er by an exhibition of generosity and
forgiveness and a large-minded amnesty toward
all people, and especially toward that class of
our people in this country which seemed, in
his judgment, to deserve particularly his sym-
pathy, his speech, and his pen. I think it is
especially proper and gentle for this House to
remember him, now that he is gone into the
silent dignity of death. AH that we can do in
the way of respect and solace is to follow him
with our deep regret and our sorrowing sym-
pathy.
The resolution was unanimously agreed to.
committee OS foreign affairs.
Mr. BANKS. Mr. Speaker, I desire to pre-
sent to the House a resignation of my ap-
pointment as a member of the Committee on
Foreign Affairs. It ia proper that the House
should be represented by one more unreserv-
edly committed to its general policy than I
can claim to be. It is quite possible that, if I
continued my services on the committee, the
same course which I have followed as one of
its members for the last seven years, I should
have found it still to be within my liue of duty
to pursue. I have supported those measures
which I have thought to be right, and have
opposed those which appeared to me to be
otherwise, without much regard to partisan
interests or relations. But, as I have said, in
this instance it appears to be strictly within
the line of propriety, and perhaps of right,
that the House should be represented by some
member unequivocally committed to its policy;
and I therefore ask its indulgence so far as to
accept the resignation that I thus tender.
