Vicksburg, May 1, 1863.

General LORING, Jackson:

Proceed at once to Edwards Depot; from thence with General Tilghman to Port Gibson. You will take command of operations there. General Tilghman will be placed in command of Tracy's brigade and his own regiments there. The other regiments of Tilghman's and Buford's brigades will come to Vicksburg, to be ordered thence to Grand Gulf when I deem it necessary. General Bowen will continue command of his own and [M. E.] Green's brigade. Obey these instructions at once.

J. C. PEMBERTON.

JACKSON, May 1, 1863.

General PEMBERTON:

Cannot the force which Tilghman has at Big Black march direct to Grand Gulf, by dirt road? Transportation is so limited here that they cannot be sent before to-morrow.

W. W. LORING.

JACKSON, May 1, 1863.

The command here can move at 12 m. Your telegram says via Vicksburg, but does not say where we are to go. Please state also if wagons, are to go. I have ordered three days' cooked rations and cooking utensils to be taken; say whether more is necessary.
