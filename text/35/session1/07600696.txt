The CHAIRMAN then proceeded to call up

of the Court of Claims be concurred in.
An adverse report (C. C. No. 93) upon the pe-
tition of Francis Picard, administrator of Pierre
Ayott.
On motion of Air. CHAFFEE, the report was
laid aside to be reported to the House with the
recommendation that it bo concurred in.
An adverse report (C. C. No. 99) upon the pe-
tition of Philip Lamoy and others.
On motion of Air. CHAFFEE, the report was
laid aside to be reported to the House with the
recommendation that it be concurred in.
Air. JONES, of Tennessee. 1 presume if the
exceptions be withdrawn, the reports to which
the exceptions are withdrawn will go with the
others already disposed of.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair holds that it
is not competent for a gentleman who made an
exception to withdraw it at this time.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Illinois. I would sug-
gest that the proper motion is, that the committee
do confirm the decision of the Court of Claims.
It is so provided in the law.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thinks that a
report is not a decision of the Court of Claims;
but an opinion, to be concurred in by the House
or not, as it chooses.
Air. MARSHALL, of Illinois. I ask that sec-
tion nine of the law be read.
The Clerk read it, as follows:
Ck The claims reported upon adversely shall be placed upon
tho Calendar when repotted, and ll the deLM>ion of said
court simll be continued by Confess, said decision ^hall be
conclusive, and the smihI eouit shall not at any Mib-jequent
pe'iud coiiMdcr said claims, uulcss .jueh rontons thrill bo
pirM'iited lo cud eouit as, by the inU1^ of common law or
clumceiy in muN between individual, would lumihh suffi-
cient giound loi giaiiliug a new tual."
Air. MARSHALL, of Illinois. Then the proper
question, as L think, is, " Shall the decision of the
Court of Claims be confirmed?" and not " Shall
the report be concurred in?5'
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair thinks that the
question is one merely of form. The Chair, how-
ever, has supposed that these were opinions of
the Court of Claims, and not, technically, decis-
ions.
An adverse report (C. C. No. 105) upon the pc*
tition of EzraT. Maniay, administrator of Louis
Marnay.
On motion of Mr. WINSLOW, the report was
laid aside to be reported to the House with a rec-
ommendation that it be concurred in.
Mr. DEW ART moved that the committee rise.
The motion was not agreed to.
An adverse report (C. C. No. 108) upon the pe-
tition of David Noble.
Air, PALMER moved that tho further consid-
eration of the report be postponed until Friday
next.
Air, CHAFFEE moved that the report of the
Court of Claims be laid aside to be reported to the
House with the recommendation that it be con-
curred in.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. 1 hope the latter
motion will be agreed to; let us dispose of the
case before we leave it.
Mr. Pai.mf.r's motion was disagreed to; and
the report was then laid aside to be reported to
the House with the recommendation that it be
concurred in.
An adverse report (C. C. No. K!9) upon tho
petition of Joseph Stokcly and others, heirs of
Nehemiah Stolc'ly.
Air. COYODE. I ask that that report be read.
Air. AIARSHALL, of Kentucky. That we
may settle these definitely, I move that the com-
mittee liso, and report the reports which have
been laid ;)«)<]<•.
Mr. COYrODE I have not yielded the floor.
This report is not a decision on the merits of this
case. I want the report referred to the Committee
of Claims, with instiuctions.
Air. JONES, ot Tennessee. What is the case?
The CHAIRMAN. No. 109.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. What is the prop-
osition ?
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania [Mr. Covode] is upon the floor.
Mr. WASHBURN, of Maine. I understand
the proposition of the gentleman from Pennsyl-
vania to be, that the bill be laid aside to be re-
ported to the House with a recommendation that
it be referred to the Committee of Claims.
Air. HOUSTON. The gentleman from Penn-
sylvania proposes to give this case a direction
which the Committee of the Whole cannot give
it. 1 suggest to him that he moveHhat it be re-
ported to the House, with a view of asking the
House to refer it to the Committee of Claims.
Mr. COYODE. I accept the suggestion of the
gentleman from Alabama, and move that the case
be laid aside to be reported to the House, with a
view to its receiving that reference.
Mr. STANTON. I suggest to the gentleman
from Pennsylvania [Mr. Covode] and to the gen-
tleman from New York, [Mr. Palmer,] that per-
haps the best way of disposing of the reports
which have been excepted to, will be to make a
motion that they be all reported to the House
with the recommendation that they be referred to
the Committee of Claims.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. Well, Mr. Chair-
man, I think as we have got them here we had
better dispose of them in this committee. Let us
give them consideration here. Let us take them
up and hear the reports road, and see what the
decisions of the court are based on.
Mr. Covode's motion was agreed to.
Mr. A1ARSHALL, of Kentucky. I move that
the committee do now rise, and report the cases
which have been acted on to the House.
Mr. STEPHENS, of Georgia. By the time
we have disposed of them it will be time to ad-
journ.
The motion was agreed to—ayes 69, noes 43.
So the committee rose; and the Speaker having
resumed tho chair, Mr. AIillson reported that the
Committee of the Whole House had had under
consideration the Private Calendar, and had in-
structed lum to report to the House sundry ad-
verse reports of the Court of Claims with the rec-
ommendation that the decisions of said court be
concurred m.
Mr. STANTON. I move that the House con-
cur in the report of the Committee of the Whole
upon the several cases reported by the chairman;
and upon that motion I ask the previous question.
Mr. MARSHALL, of Kentucky. The ques-
tion is, " Shall the decisions of the court be con-
firmed ?"
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I wish to submit
this proposition to the Chair, with a view to pre-'
vent this case being drawn into a precedent here-
after. I do not understand that the question can
be put upon all these cases at the same time, if
objection be made; but that, if a separate vote
were called for upon each, it could be had.
The SI3EAKEk. Certainly.
Mr. JONES, of Tennessee. I do not ask for
a separate vote in this instance; but this is the
first case of the kind we have had this session,
and I wish to provide against its being made a
precedent.
The SPEAKER. The Chair would hold that
any member had a right to demand a separate vote
upon any case he might indicate.
The previous question was seconded; and the
mam question was ordered to be put.
The question was then taken; and the recom-
mendation of the Court of Claims was concurred
in, in the following cases:
