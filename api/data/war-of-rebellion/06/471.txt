McFarland, Langdon, Closson, Shipley, Jackson, Pemmington, Seeley, and Taylor, merit my warmest encomiums for the coolness and deliberation with which they performed, without one exception, their duty under a heavy and continuous shower of shot, shells, and splinters for two successive days. Lieutenant Todd, ordnance officer, had full supplies of all required articles which were on hand at the post, and his department was conducted with system and efficiency. Major Tower, Surgeon Campbell, and Assistant Surgeon Sutherland, in their respective duties, sustained their high reputations. Captains Robertson, Duryea, and Blunt, and Lieutenants Pennington and Seeley, respectively, commanded Batteries Lincoln, Scott, Totten, and Cameron, and small battery at Spanish Fort, and the other officers batteries in the fort, with distinguished ability. Captains Dobie's and Bailey's companies were with the batteries at Lincoln and Cameron, and did their duties faithfully and efficiently. The companies of Captains Henberer and Fuffy, of the Sixth Regiment New York Volunteers, were successively on duty at the fort, and rendered cheerfully important assistance to me. The regular companies engaged at the batteries, all of whom performed their duty so efficiently as to preclude my making a distinction, are Companies A, F, and L, First Artillery; C, H,and K, Second Artillery; C and E, Third Infantry, and Companies G and I, Sixth Regiment New York Volunteers.

In closing, I tender to Flag-Officer McKean and Captain Ellison, of the Navy, and to their officers and crews, my best thanks for their able co-operation, which would have had the happiest results but for the unfortunate fact that the great draught of water prevented their sufficiently near approach to the works of the rebels.

HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF FLORIDA,Fort Pickens, December 3, 1861.

GENERAL: I intended to have made out a list of meritorious non-commissioned officers and privates on the 22nd and 23rd, but on looking over the sub-reports of the officers I find some are not noticed by name who under my own personal observation behaved with great gallantry and coolness. Indeed, I think where all really howled such cool, deliberate courage that distinction can hardly be made without doing injustice. I heartily indorse the recommendations of Major Arnold and the officers, and extend my approbation to every one engaged. I would respectfully suggest that by submitting these reports to the Ordnance Department it might give information which, if acted on, would very much benefit the service, particularly those parts relating to shells and rifled projectiles, and to the fuses, which were detestable.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

HARVEY BROWN,

Colonel, Commanding.
