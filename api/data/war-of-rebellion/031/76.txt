Major-General HOOKER,Commanding Center Grand Division:

GENERAL: Upon my arrival here at our old camp-ground, I find a brigade of General Sigel's command encamped on a portion of General Sykes' old ground. Humphreys' and Griffin's divisions are getting in pretty near to their old places. As General Sigel ranks me, I cannot give him orders. I would respectfully ask further instructions that will remedy the difficulty.

I am, very respectfully, yours,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Brigadier-General, Commanding Fifth Corps.
