The foregoing is a list of the batteries of the First Division, Artillery, Defenses, the distance separating them, and the number of the men deemed necessary to guard the ammunition at them.

To keep this guard, however, constantly on duty it will be perceived that it is necessary to furnish just double the number of men here estimated for to stand post the alternate days and nights, say about 300 men. It will, of course, be observed also that the above estimated makes no allowance for men who may be taken sick or disabled from other causes (furloughs, &amp;c.), from being on duty, the above being the number of men "oft duty" constantly required for regular guards.

Respectfully submitted.

Lieutenant-Colonel, Commanding.
