THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
March 28,
mainly to " protect" a man who has actually
manufactured a bale of similiar cloths in this
country and has them in the market to sell,
lie says to the farmer, "You must understand,
sir, that the policy of this country is to protect
'American industry."' Butthe farmer don't see
it. He says, in reply, "This bale of cloth is
the product of my industry. My capital and
labor produced the wheat with which I pur-
chased it, and therefore it is the product of my
industry, and I am an American." The col-
lector answers: "You should nothavebought
a bale of British cloth with it." The farmer
replies: "I was obliged to do that. I could
not find a market for my wheat here, and I had
to seek one abroad." The argument does no
good. He has to pay the duty, and when he
gets into market, the American bale of cloth
has the advantage of 100 per cent, over him.
And to cap the climax, on inquiry the farmer
finds that the " protected" man is a man roll-
ing in wealth and luxury and owning his mil-
lions of stock in the great factories of Lowell.
He then understands what is meant by protect-
ing " American industry" against the " pauper
labor of Europe."
BETTER POLICY TO TAX COFFEE, TEA, AND SUGAR.
The illustration which I have given touching
the article of pig iron, and those I have con-
structed embracing other branches of "pro-
tected" industry, show how heavily and griev-
ously protective duties bear upon the farmer
and workingman, the producers and consumers
of the great bulk of the products and fabrics
of this country ; how much tliey have to pay in
bounties to the "protected" classes, in order
to get comparatively a small sum into the
Treasury. They show by the sure demonstra-
tion of figures, that in order to raise $180,-
000,000 of revenue for the Treasury on the
articles which they embody, the unprotected and
consuming classes pay to the manufacturers the
enormous sumof $500,000,000, in the shape of
bounties to the "protected" classes.
I am aware that the popular mind is not
prepared to submit to heavy duties on coffee,
i oa, and sugar; or rather to repeal the duties on
ihose articles on the plea that they are neces-
saries of life is an ever-pleasing proposition
to the people, and because I think the people
desire it 1 shall vote for the modification or
repeal of those duties when the question is pre-
sented for my action. But at the same time I
have no doubt it would be better for the unpro-
tected and consuming classes if the duties
on those articles were retained and the whole
list of "protective" duties swept from the
statute-book or greatly modified. A short
arithmetical calculation will demonstrate this
proposition. The amount of duties collected
on the articles of coffee, tea, and sugar, includ-
ing molasses, for the commercial year ending
June 30, 1868, according to the last returns
published, is as follows :
On coffee     '.$10,037,859
On tea       9.414.604
On sugar and molasses  34,858,068
$54,910,589
Of the first two articles not any are produced
in this country, and but a small quantity of
sugar. Thus, in contributing this amount to
the Treasury, the people are compelled to pay
nothing in the shape of bounty to the producer
of a rival domestic article save a small sum to
the sugar producer. The amount of the duties
measures nearly the whole burden of taxation
to which the people are subjected on these
articles.
I have shown that in order to get $1,121,125
of revenue on the article of pig iron the peo-
ple have to pay, in the shape of bounty to the
manufacturer, the sum of $29,914,200. A re-
duction of two thirds of that duty would result
in a saving to the people of at least one half
of the bounty, or §14,951,130. It would be
left in their own pockets instead of going into
the pockets of the manufacturers. Thus, on
that single item nearly one and a half time
the amount of all the duties on coffee would
be saved to the people. Reasonable reduc-
tions on other protected articles giving protec-
tion enough to enable them to compete with
the foreign manufacturer in our own markets ;
would much more than equal the entire amount
of the duties levied upon the articles of coffee,
tea, and sugar. (Same calculations to be made
on the other protected articles.) And thus the
people would be the great gainers. Coffee, tea,
and sugar are not articles of prime necessity.
Food, clothing, and fuel, and tools of trade
are. It is wiser, therefore, to relieve the lat-
ter articles of the burden of taxation than the
former.
HOME MARKET.
In order to reconcile the farming and con-
suming population of this country to the mon-
strous exactions and robbei'y of the "protect-
ive" system, its advocates and beneficiaries
profess to supply a "home market" for the
surplus productions of the farmer. They
plausibly argue that the farmer must buy and
consume their products, in consideration of
which they will buy and consume his. They
would establish a perfect reciprocity of pro-
duction and consumption. And this plausible
and captivating theory they individualize under
the symbol of the "plow, loom, and anvil,"
which embodies the idea that the plow should
consume the surplus products of the loom and
the anvil, and the two latter the surplus pro-
ducts of the plow. In other words, neither the
farmer nor manufacturer is to be sent abroad
to seek markets for his surplus products; but
the one must consume the surplus products of
the other at home, and the number of persons
employed in the production and consumption
must be so equally balanced as to produce
these results.
Let us see how well this theory can be car-
ried out in practice, and how well the manu-
facturer, the impersonation of the loom and
anvil, can perform his part of the • proposed
compact. The farmer executes his part of it.
He consumes all the products of the manufac-
turer, and not having enough of the " home "
products, is obliged to make up the deficit from
abroad. But how is it with the manufacturer ?
Does he consume the surplus products of the
farmer? Let us see. In 1868 the planter and
farmer produced of—
Cotton 2,700,000 bales, of 450 pounds cach, oqual in
pounds to      1,215,000,000
Corn, bushels  900.000,000
Wheat, bushels  300,000,000
Leaving sugar out of the calculation, let us
see how much cotton and wheat produced by
the planter and farmer the cotton-manufacturer
will consume.
In the same year (1868) the cotton-manufac-
turer consumed 450,000,000 pounds of cotton,
leaving 705,000,000 pounds in the hands of the
planter, for which he is compelled to seek a
foreign market.
In 18G8, according to the estimate of Com-
missioner Wells, the cotton-manufacturers
employed 6,930,34(5 spindles, representing a
capital invested of $138,000,920, and producing
$375,000,000 in value of cloth. Now, in order
to enable him to consume this surplus cotton
of the planter he must add 11,781,588 spindles
to his present number, making in the whole
18,711,934 spindles; to his capital $235,625,764,
making in the whole $374,232,684, and to his
product $613,055,555 in value, making the
whole amount $988,055,-655.
In 1868 the country consumed nearly all of
the cotton goods manufactured here, namely,
$375,000,000 in value,there beingbut very little
exported and $15,686,371 imported from for-
eign countries. The domestic consumption of
cotton goods was therefore $300,686,371 in the
whole. Deduct this amount from the amount
which the manufacturer produces in order to
enable him to consume the entire product of
raw cotton for that year, and it leaves a bal-
ance of $597,369,184over andabove the entire
consumption of the country in 1868. Now, what
is to be done with the manufacturer? He has,
in order to consume all the cotton of the plant-
er, a surplus over the consumption of the coun-
try of $597,369,184, or nearly twice the amount
of cotton goods consumed in 1868. How is he
to be relieved? He must not be sent abroad
to seek a market. That would be as unjust to
him as it is to the farmer to send him abroad.
It can be done only by enlarging the home
market; and in order to do that we must in-
crease the population in proportion equal to
the surplus of manufactures. The country
now contains 40,000,000 people. In order
to have a population sufficient to consume the
surplus of the manufacturer to our present pop-
ulation we must add about 70,000,000 more,
making in the whole a population of 110,000,-
000 ! The thing is impossible, and the beautiful
theory of the home market is exploded.^
The same results will be arrivedat with re-
gard to the wheat grower. Commissioner Wells
estimates the whole quantity of wheat produced
in the United States in 1869 at 300,000,000
bushels. Of this quantity allow every tenth
bushel for seed or 30,000,000 bushels, and
5 bushels a head for consumption, which
would bo 200,000,000 bushels, making the
entire consumption of wheat for seed and food
230,000,000 bushels; this would leave a surplus
of 70,000,000 bushels, which must find a mar-
ket in foreign countries.
Let us see how much the manufacturers
could do toward disposing of this surplus. 1
have already included thomin the consumption
of the whole population. But I will suppose
they have consumed none of the 200,000,000
bushels allowed for the consumption of the en-
tire population, but will set them to work at
eating up the surplus of 70,000,000 bushels.
According to the estimate of Commissioner
Wells for 1869, the number of hands employed
in the leading "protected" industries of the
country is as follows :
111 the cotton manufacture  125,003
In the woolen manufacture  90,000
In tlio pig and bar iron manufacture  115,000
In tho leather manufacture  180,000
In tho paper manufacture  25,000
Total   535,000
Tlie number is of course made up from men,
women, and children ; some married and some
unmarried. But to be as favorable as possible
to the advocates of the "protective" system,
1 will suppose that each of these employes
represents a family of four persons. That
would increase the number of employes and
dependants engaged in these branches of in-
dustry to 2,140,000 persons. Allowing the
usual number of bushels to each person, namely,
5, and tliejr yearly consumption would be
10,700,000 bushels. I also allow 2,000,000
bushels to be used in starch and for other pur-
poses, making an aggregate of 12,700,000 bush-
els for the consumption of all the persons
engaged in these five great leading branches
of manufactures. This quantity deducted from
the 70,000,000 surplus would still leave the
farmer a surplus of 58,300,000 bushels, for
which he must seek a market in foreign coun-
tries. In order to consume that quantity all
these great manufacturing interests must be
more than quadrupled. Their own productions
in tho same proportions, thus overwhelming our
own country and the world with their surplus
productions.
I repeat that the thing is an impossibility.
The theory of the "home market" is a fallacy,
an absurdity, an impracticability in the actual
economies of society.
FREE TRADE.
And what do these facts proclaim ? What
principle do they develop? What great truth
do they establish"? This : that free trade is the
great law which should and will ultimately gov-
ern the industrial operations of mankind. It
is the law which the Almighty has stamped
upon the very constitution of society, which is
but an aggregate of the creating, producing,
and industrious animal called man. God him-
self is a free-trader, as He has proclaimed in
the arrangements of this earth and the ani-
