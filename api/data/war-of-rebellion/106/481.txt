HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF UTAH,Camp Douglas, June 11, 1863-2. 15 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel R. C. DRUM,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

A powerful tribe (the Southern Utes) have commenced hostilities; killed driver and employe of mail company twenty-five miles west of here yesterday. Rumor says 1,600 of them in Mormon settlements south on way to attack me and destroy overland mail. The Snake Indians, with the exception of two small bands, are peaceable and have given up stolen property. Goshutes still troublesome. My force much scttered; should be doubled at once. I am surrounded by enemies, white and red.

SIR: The general commanding the department directs that you will at once proceed to join General Connor's command at or in the vicinity of Salt Lake City. As there may be some difficulty in proceeding alone over the overland route, you will join and take command of the troops under Captain Brown, Second Cavalry, which will probably leave Fort Churchill to-day.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,
