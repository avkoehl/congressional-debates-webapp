Lieutenant Colonel D. M. DRAPER,

Sturgeon:

I have no orders for you but to find and kill the guerrillas. If the concentration is as large as reported, General Douglass and Major King should unite with yourself and Major Leonard. Proceed cautiously but with determination. I have no fear of results if you find the enemy. I am fearful that the villains may scatter and concentrate in your rear or Columbia or Fayette. Strengthen yourself from all possible sources, and push on day and night until the murderous assassins are destroyed. Keep me posted.

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

Colonel E. A. KUTZNER,

Macon:

I am pained to learn of the disaster at Centralia. Major Johnston should have united his force with Major King, as ordered. Move into this section as quickly as possible. Lieutenant Clarke, aide-de-camp, will join you to-day from Saint Joseph and give orders. Post me fully as soon as you hear further from Centralia.*

CLINTON B. FISK,

Brigadier-General.

MACON, September 28, 1864.

Brigadier-General FISK:

The facts as far as I can learn about the encounter between the command of De Graw and the First Iowa Cavalry were these: Colonel De Graw was going out on a scout, and about ten or twelve miles south of Laclede he saw a body of men coming toward him on the prairie. De Graw immediately got his men in a favorable position near the timber to give the enemy battle. The enemy (First Iowa Cavalry) sent a few men up the prairie and made a flank movement with the balance, and brought up in line of battle in front of De Graw a few hundred yards apart. De Graw immediately gave the order to retreat. The men hesitated and he gave the order again and commenced the retreat, with the men following at double-quick or faster. The First Iowa did not fire, but followed with a few men, picking up the colors which were lost, an hats, caps, and guns, which were brought in as trophies of war. Some of the Enrolled Missouri Militia were captured and told that they were in no danger, but Colonel Hynes, I was told, spurned [sic] to the valiant colonel of the Enrolled Missouri Militia. I have heard that Captain Holland, who was along, wanted to fight, but Colonel [de Graw] insisted that he was in command of the Enrolled Missouri Militia.

How many loyalists with arms and a will to muster out the infernal fiends now spreading death and desolation in their bloody pathway
