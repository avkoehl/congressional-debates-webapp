Brigadier-General MEIGS,

Quartermaster-General:

GENERAL: You will immediately take measures to collect at Alexandria water transportation for the Sixth and Nineteenth Corps, of General Sheridan's army, to City Point. They will probably soon leave the Valley by Manassas and Thoroughfare Gaps.

Very respectfully,

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

CAMDEN STATION, Baltimore, October 4, 1864.

Honorable C. A. DANA,

Assistant Secretary of War:

All our troops cars are fully occupied in military movements upon our road and branches, and to send thirty cars to the Northern Central will cause delays that may prove injurious. Allow me to suggest that the Pennsylvania Central can supply the Northern Central at Harrisburg, thus saving much delay in placing the cars at Elmira. Under the circumstances, please advise, and your instructions shall have prompt attention. To economize time, I forward the same suggestion to Mr. Cameron, at Harrisburg.

J. W. GARRETT.
