The general desires you to take command of all the troops on the line indicated by the dispatch inclosed, unless otherwise ordered by competent authority. As soon as a division of General Howard's command can be brought back here the line assigned to you will be shortened to some point between here and Decherd. Inclosed is a memoranda hastily compiled from the best present sources of information of the troops stationed on the line assigned to you.

The general directs that you have examined all the bridges on the route, all approaches [roads, trails, &amp;c.] to the road, pickets thrown well out, positions selected for defensive purposes, and everything arranged for the proper performance of this duty. The troops of your command here and at Bridgeport have been ordered to return to Decherd.

We shall probably be without transportation until the arrival of the wagons from Nashville. Headquarters will be at this point for the present. The general directs that you require all the troops along the line to stay in camp and be ready to spring to arms at short notice.

Please report where your headquarters are. Report any useful information promptly by telegraph.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

DANL. BUTTERFIELD,

Major-General, Chief of Staff.
