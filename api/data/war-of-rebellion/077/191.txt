Question. How far to the right and left of the Baldwyn road did your last line extend?

Answer. That was very small, sir. I had not more than 400 or 500 men in line, and they were near the Baldwyn road and not engaged with the enemy. I held the line longer than I thought I ought to be required to do with the men I had, and could only do so by assuring the men that the infantry were near by.

Answer. I saw them on the road to Baldwyn. They came up with the infantry and made a charge.
