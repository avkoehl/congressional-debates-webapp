General BRAGG:

Wheeler has been forced on this side of the Tennessee River. Have ordered him to move in this direction, destroying railroad as he comes. Taylor informs me Forrest will start on his mission to- morrow. As Wheeler, from superior numbers, is compelled to cross south of Tennessee River I suggest that Forrest be ordered to operate between this point and Chattanooga. Wheeler, and I can re- enforce him with, will do the same.
