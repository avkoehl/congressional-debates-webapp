THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
June 25,
property taken in the rebellious States. Where
the officer had the money he paid down at the
time. It has been done all through the war.
Mr. HOWARD. Not as the act of the
commander-in-chief.
Mr. TRUMBULL. Yes, as the'act of the
commander; and where he did not have the
money he gave a receipt for it; and now, be-
cause he did not have the money, you will not
pay! This bill provides for paying where your
proper officer took the property of a loyal man
and gave a receipt for it. If he liad had the
money ho would have paid at the time; but
because the officer did not have money to pay
down and gave a receipt for the property you
will not pay, and you never heard of an in-
stance where anybody did! Certainly such
payments have been made all through the war.
Now, that there may be no mistake as to this
question of loyalty, I propose to define it a
little more strictly, and I think that will obvi-
ate some of the objections of my friend from
Michigan, and perhaps the objections of others.
I shall move at the proper time an amendment
to define the question of loyalty, which I will
read:
That the claimant must, in proof of his loyalty,
establish by evidence that from the time his claim
accrued, and ever since, he has firmly and faithfully
maintained his adherence and allegiance to the Gov-
ernment of the United States, by defending its cause
against the rebellion, government, and forces of the
so-called confederate States in all suitable and prac-
ticable ways and according to his ability and oppor-
tunity.
I am willing to adopt a provision defining
loyalty in that way, that it shall not be simply
passive, but that the claimant shall be required
to prove that he has manifested his loyalty
upon all suitable and practicable occasions,
according to his ability ; that whenever oppor-
tunity offered he has shown affirmatively that
he was and is loyal; and when ho shows that
T think he ought to be paid if his property has
been taken and receipted for by the proper offi-
cer, or, if a receipt was not given, where it was
taken and used by the Government.
Mr. WILSON. Mr. President, the Senator
from Illinois tells us that the passage of this
bill will save hundreds of thousands and mil-
lions of dollars, and that explains the extraor-
dinary zeal he manifests for it. I took occa-
sion to refer to a remark made by a gentleman
who for four years has been daily engaged in
matters pertaining to the loyalty of these peo-
ple, and who tells me that under the bill the
whole population can prove themselves loyal.
The Senator himself confesses its weakness by
his proposed amendment. My side remark
was not made to him, but he took occasion
publicly to comment upon it.
Now, sir, I will say to the Senator that this
is a .dangerous bill, that there are millions upon
millions of dollars involved in it, and this Sen-
ate and this Congress ought not to pass it. If
we arc to legislate at all, if we are to extend
the provisions of a law applicable and which
have been applicable to loyal States, to the
eleven disloyal States in the present condition
of the country, and in their present condi-
tion, I think the act should be most studiously
guarded and carefully worded. If loyal per-
sons, persons who can prove themselves loyal,
have received from officers of the Government
certificates for supplies furnished the Army,
there is some claim in that, but here is a pro-
vision in this bill that persons who have received
no certificates may make their application.
That almost the entire population can prove
and will prove themselves loyal people in order
to obtain this compensation, I entertain no
doubt. There are Departments of this Gov-
ernment where they are doing it now. There
are Departments of this Government in Wash-
ington where there is evidence to show that a
very large portion of the population there al-
ways have been loyal. Whenever these money
claims are made it is pretty easy to prove the
man to have been loyal to the country or never
to have given any voluntary support to the rebel-
lion.
