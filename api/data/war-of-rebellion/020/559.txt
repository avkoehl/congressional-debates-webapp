Honorable GEORGE W. RANDOLPH,

Secretary of War:

I not only cannot spare any more troops from this department, but there is danger here unless I am re-enforced.

Brigadier General W. D. SMITH, James Island, S. C.:

The enemy are reported to be two regiments and ten pieces of artillery strong in nearly the same position that they occupied yesterday. The section of Chatham Artillery has been ordered back which had not been ordered to move.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
HDQRS. DEPT. OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA,Charleston, S. C., June 11, 1862.

Brigadier-General SMITH:

GENERAL: I have every reason to believe the enemy is erecting a battery in about the position where you found him yesterday. As we have not done it it is reasonable to suppose he will, from the importance of the position. I am informed this evening that he has two regiments and ten pieces of field artillery there. Can you not take his batteries, or at least derange his plans? You must keep up a constant skirmishing with him. It will accustom the men to fire, which is essential, if it effects nothing else. Is it possible to burn the woods I have been so anxious to hold? You can get resin and turpentine and the wind is favorable. Give me your own and General Gist's views. My own are decided as to the importance of driving him from that woods in some way, or at least of exposing him to our artillery.

Your pickets must be very much on the alert-the officer of the day constantly moving. Have you field officers of the day? I shall get a little more powder to-night, but if it is wasted by firing at gunboats from Secessionville it might as well not be here. I am informed Colonel Lamar has been returning their fire again. You must put a stop to this.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.

CHARLESTON, S. C., June 11, 1862.

Brigadier General N. G. EVANS, Adams Run, S. C.:

Have you received my telegram? Send a least one good regiment; more if you can. It is evident that the enemy is not in great force before you.

J. C. PEMBERTON,

Major-General, Commanding.
