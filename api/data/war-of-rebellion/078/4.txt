Brigadier General J. W. DAVIDSON,

Commanding Cavalry Bureau, Saint Louis, Mo.:

GENERAL: I am instructed by Major-General Sherman (by telegraph) to direct that all the cavalry regiments at Saint Louis belonging to the SIXTEENTH Army Corps be sent forward without any delay to Memphis. * He is of the opinion that until they obtain horses they can be of good service as garrison, and that the horses can follow as soon as practicable.

You will please cause the necessary to be given and have the men, both those now at Saint Louis and who may arrive, forwarded with all possible dispatch.

I again urge the controlling for pushing forward horses as soon as practicable.

I am, general, your obedient servant,

S. A. HURLBUT,

Major-General.
