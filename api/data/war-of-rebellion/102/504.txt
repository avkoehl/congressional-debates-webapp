Lieutenant Colonel C. T. CHRISTENSEN,

Asst. Adjt. General, Military Division of West Mississippi:

COLONEL: I have the honor to submit to your consideration the following report of information received at this office this 19th day of May, 1865: Mr. Bell, a scout sent from this office, has just returned from Bayou Sara and vicinity. He reports that a Doctor Bealls, Confederate cotton agent, residing at or near Bayou Sara, La., has 1,600 bales of Confederate cotton secreted somewhere on the line of the Jackson railroad, which he proposes to sell on private account. A widow lady in the confidence of Doctor B., residing at Bayou Sara, says that he (Bealls) proposes to retain the cotton until such time as he can dispose of it satisfactorily to himself. That he does not intend the Confederate or United States Government shall have the benefit of it. Sixty bales, reported to have been shipped to New Orleans for the purpose of purchasing medical supplies for the rebel army, were sold and the proceeds retained by the said Bealls.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

FRANK N. WICKER,

Lieutenant, Signal Corps, U. S. Army.
