A person just from Hampton Roads reports nothing new. The Merrimac expected out, and waited for with a confident feeling of ability to suppress her. Mr. Fox agrees with me that [it] is most probable she will make her next sortie in all of this week and will be neutralized.

Will Heintzelman's advance division get off this afternoon?
