HOUSTON, February 29, 1864.

Brigadier General H. P. BEE:

I had the honor to address you a communication on yesterday in regard to remounting certain commands. The major-general commanding instructs me now to say that he wishes the regiments of Woods, Pyron, and Gould mounted. This can be done by sending the men to their horses and having them taken to some sonvenient point on the line to Indianola or Victoria and causing the men to meet them there. The regiment of Colonel Buchel, now mounted, will join these regiments at this point in order that all may move together. Your judgment will decide the best method of getting all the regiments above specified together at some suitable point on the route above referred to. The above movement is designed in advance of an expedition which the general contemplates against Indianola.

You are requested to indicate fully your views, and state what course in regard to remounting the above troops specified has been adopted by you. The battery of Captain Moseley, one rifle, one 12-pounder howitzer, two 7 1/2-pounders, and the battery of Captain Hughes, one rifle and three 12-pounder howitzers, will also form a part of this advance, and will move with the regiments above specified. You will understand that this is strictly confidential, and will not be disclosed to any one.

Very respectfully,

E. P. TURNER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.

HOUSTON, February 29, 1864.

Brigadier General H. P. BEE:

I am instructed by the major-general commanding to say to you that the want of the necessary depots of supplies will delay the contemplated expedition against Indianola, and to direct you to let the horses of the cavalry remain in their present position a few days and order Pyron's, Woods', Gould's, and Buchel's regiments to concentrate at Camp Dixie (the former camp of Colonel Debray) for the present, the ranking officers assuming command of the camp. The other troops will remain in their present positions.

You will, however, countermand the order for Debray's regiment to proceed above the railroad, retaining it where it now is, and order the detachment now at Velasco to rejoin the regiment wherever it may be. You will have Brown's regiment mounted, and direct them to perform all picket and outpost duty on the coast from San Luis Pass west to the peninsula, inclusive. Buchel will take his horses with his regiment to camp Dixie. You will, after giving the necessary orders, in accordance with these instructions, report in person without delay, in company with Brigadier-General Green, at these headquarters, for consultation with the major-general commanding, turning over the command from San Luis to the peninsula to Colonel Bates, the next officer in rank. Colonel Bankhead will give the necessary orders in regard to the artillery intended for the expedition.

Very respectfully,

STEPHEN D. YANCEY,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
