"Charge them, boys! charge them!" and right nobly did his gallant boys respond. Discovering that we were too far in advance of our brigade, we fell back on Colonel Armistead's regiment and received orders from Colonel Spence, commanding, to form on his left and await further orders.

At the lapse of half an hour the order was given to charge the court-house and jail, both of which we found strongly barricaded. We soon succeeded in effecting an entrance into the jail. Our attack on the court-house, however, was quite unsuccessful, resulting in the loss of many brave them. The sharp rattling of fire-arms on rear did not allow us to improve the advantages gained in securing the lower apartments of the jail. To meet this sudden and unexpected demonstration we were ordered to fall back to a convenient position. As soon as circumstances would permit we formed a line of battle and awaited the onset of the foe. A large body of cavalry suddenly appearing from the direction of Chattanooga, dashed in close proximity to our line, pouring a colley into our ranks. Our men promptly returned the fire and drove them back. Being then ordered to repair to our horses, we mounted and withdrew from the scene of action in good order and without losing a single horse.

I have the honor to be, major, your obedient servant,

W. V. HARRELL,

Captain, Commanding Battalion.
