wooded with dense undergrowth. The enemy's lines appear to have a deep re-entering angle toward the Hardshell Church, which angle I have not reached. The batteries in front of my right and left cross their fire over this angular space. I will endeavor to develop the enemy's lines fully in the morning. Stoneman is operating on my right, toward and beyond Lost Mountain. I have no report from him yet. Some of the have rendered it nearly and cavalry. The enemy's artillery firing from pine Mountain to-day shows that point to be about 3,000 yards from Kemp's Mill, which may be of value to your topographers.

Very respectfully,

Major General GEORGE STONEMAN,

Commanding Cavalry Corps, Department of the Ohio:

GENERAL: Your report of reconnaissance this p. m. is received. It is very well, all that could have been done to-day. I would like to have a force sent in the morning along the enemy's works (substantially) until it strikes their present left, which I suppose to be not far from the front of Hascall's right. I suspect that the line you passed is the continuation of the one seen in front of Hascall, and that is not the enemy's main line. I propose to ascertain to-morrow what it is, and to drive the enemy out of it, if it is not held in strong force. A demonstration on the enemy's left will assist very much. I do not think a large force will be necessary.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.

Brigadier General M. S. HASCALL,

Commanding Second Division, Twenty-third Army Corps:

GENERAL: Please occupy early in the morning the space now occupied by General McLean, between your present left and the creek. I desire all of General Cox's division to be in hand on the left of the creel for tomorrow's operations. I will order up two regiments of Colonel McQuiston's brigade in the morning; until they arrive you can contract your right, or take necessary troops from you reserve to occupy the space on your left, or so much of it as you deem it necessary to occupy. I hope to gain a point of the enemy's line in front of Cox's center to-morrow. Be ready to advance and take the line in your front if Cox's movement makes it practicable to do so without severe loss. I suspect that the line in your immediate front is not the enemy's main line.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

J. M. SCHOFIELD,

Major-General, Commanding.
