HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,In the Field, August 20, 1864-1 p.m.

Brevet Major-General CROOK,

Commanding Army of West Virginia:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you at once move your command back toward Charlestown, via the Berryville and Charlestown pike. As soon as you have given the necessary orders of march for your command, you will ride in advance, so as to reach these headquarters before the head of your column can reach General Emory's position. You will receive instruction on your arrival here as to the position to be taken up by your troops.

Very respectfully,

JAS. W. FORSYTH,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS CAVALRY, MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,August 20, 1864.

General MERRITT,

Commanding First Division:

GENERAL: I have the honor to inclose you copy of order* from General Sheridan's headquarters in reference to house-burning, &amp;c. General Torbert wishes that you would return to General Crook the ambulances belonging to him that you have been using, if you have received your own. General Wilson reports that a party of General Averell's, which started from his headquarters to return to General Averell, were driven back between Middleway and Bunker Hill, and that the enemy were in the latter place in some force.

Very respectfully,

M. A. RENO,

Captain and Chief of Staff.

Gun ammunition goes with this escort. Return the wagons as soon as possible.

SUMMIT POINT, August 20, 1864-12 m.

MY DEAR MERRITT: Everything quiet in this direction. Rebels picketing along the Opequon. Averell's two squadrons were driven out of Martinsburg yesterday (report) by Fitzhugh Lee's division and two regiments of infantry. Reno writes: "They (we) anticipate a movement of rebels in force through Snicker's Gap to join Lee's entire army for an invasion by Edwards' Ferry," which I don't believe. What's going on?

Very truly, yours,

J. H. WILSON.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST CAVALRY DIVISION,August 20, 1864.

Colonel DI CESNOLA,

Commanding Brigade:

I wish you would send frequently reconnaissances to your front and right front to learn anything of importance with reference to the move-
