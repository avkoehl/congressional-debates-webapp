PULASKI, November 20, 1864.

Brigadier-General AMMEN,

Knoxville, Tenn.:

Reorganize the Tennessee troops as soon as you can; also try to get horses to fully mount the Tenth Michigan. I will telegraph General Stoneman to send you re-enforcements as soon as possible. It is not worth while to take the offensive until your are strong enough to make sure work of it; but if the enemy give you a change, regain all the ground you can and save forage.
