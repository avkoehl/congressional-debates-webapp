HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION,December 9, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

You telegraphed yesterday that Mosby was at or near Leesburg. Have you any information on the same subject this morning? Augur's cavalry was directed to scout up to Leesburg. Please answer.

P. H. SHERIDAN,

Major-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, December 9, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

I have no information from Mosby since last night.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

HARPER'S FERRY, December 9, 1864.

Major-General SHERIDAN:

Most of the men now arriving for front are recruits, substitutes, and drafted men. They come in small lots and have to be retained here several days to be armed and equipped, affording them an opportunity to desert, arising from the fact that we have no building in which they can be sheltered and confined. I think it would be better to send them through to their regiments without stopping them here at all. With the railroad to Stephenson's Dept there would be but little trouble to arm them at the front, by the officers here for that purpose being there instead of Harper's Ferry. I make this suggestion for another reason; it would prevent any details from officers and men belonging to the commands at the front for duty here-which is unavoidable with Camp Distribution at this post.

Respectfully,

JNO. D. STEVENSON,

Brigadier-General.

S. F. ADAMS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.
