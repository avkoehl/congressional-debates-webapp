CAPE GIRARDEAU, May 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING,

Commanding:

What do you think of sending one company of the colored troops to Bloomfield? It should be re-enforced.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS SAINT LOUIS DISTRICT,Saint Louis, May 2, 1864.

Colonel ROGERS,

Cape Girardeau:

Your telegram received. You will not send any of the colored troops to Bloomfield. It appears from your dispatch that there is a necessity that Bloomfield should be immediately re-enforced. You will therefore send Company C, Second Missouri Artillery, at once.

By order of Brigadier-General Ewing:

H. HANNAHS,

Acting Assistant Adjutant-General.

CAPE GIRARDEAU, May 2, 1864.

Brigadier-General EWING:

I know of no immediate or pressing necessity for re-enforcing Bloomfield, but the commanding officer at that post asks for re-enforcements. He says he has not sufficient force to do the necessary scouting and garrison the place.

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
