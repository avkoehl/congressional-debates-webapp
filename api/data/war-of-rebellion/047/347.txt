General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Have ascertained that One hundred and twenty-seventh New York Regiment, said to be just from Meade's army, is on duty about mouth of Stono, which proves that Gillmore is being re-enforced from army in Virginia.

One monitor aground near Cumming's Point; hope to disable her from Sullivan's and James Island batteries.

HDQRS. DEPT. SOUTH CAROLINA, GEORGIA, AND FLORIDA,Charleston, S. C., September 8, 1863.

Major HUTSON LEE,

Chief Quartermaster:

MAJOR: There will be here several regiments of State troops by the end of the week. They will need supplies of camp and garrison equipage. Tents, I presume, you cannot furnish. Cooking utensils, of course, they must have, and you will, therefore, take measure to have them supplied without delay. If they have been sent out of the city, telegraph to have them returned at once; say, for four regiments.

Respectfully, your obedient servant,

THOMAS JORDAN,

Chief of Staff.

General S. COOPER,

Adjutant and Inspector General, Richmond, Va.:

Enemy reported to have landed a force at Legareville, John's Island. This looks like offensive movements soon along StoNumbers Immediate re-enforcement of good troops-say, two or three brigades-are indispensable for safety of Charleston.

Ironsides and six monitors are now engaged with Sullivan's Island batteries, and firing occasionally on Sumter.
