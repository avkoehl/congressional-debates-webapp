An examination of the figures which I am
about to submit will show that total amount
paid for salaries and expenses of assessors and
assistant assessors for the year ending June
30, 1872, was in round numbers $3,200,000, ex-
clusive of the amount paid storekeepers, about
$460,000. Thus the total reduction of expense
bv the act abolishing assessors after the 1st of
July, 1873, will be about $2,760,000. The
total salary, expenses, &u., of all collectors'
oiiices for the year ending June 30, 1872,
amounted to very nearly $2,000,000. Taking
these figures as a basis, the expense of collect-
ing the revenue during the year 1874, allowing
about $750,000 for gaugers, (a very large
&um,) ought not to exceed $3,800,000, while
this bill appropriates $4,600,000, an excess of
about $1,300,000, for which there is no abso-
lute necessity. I submit the following state-
ment in detail:

Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. I had
hoped that the question of increase of salaries
would be discussed only wfien that question
came up for consideration ; that is the time
to discuss it. I am content to go into the
discussion at that time and take such share of
obloquy or praise as it may be thought proper
to mete out to me personally in the discussion
of a principle. We have discussed the matter
once in this committee, and have passed upon
it with as fall an attendance of members as
there is now.
I rise now simply to antagonize on this
point the statement of the gentleman from
California, [Mr. Sargent,] that salaries are
raised only at the beginning of the session.
In the year 1857 salaries were raised within
three hours of the final adjournment of Con-
gress upon the report of a committee of con-
ference, adopted after the hour of midnight.
Mr. BANKS. An J so in 1866.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. Yery
well. Therefore the precedents are all in our
favor. Why we have to deal with this matter
at this time is because by objections the sub-
ject has been carried over from day to-day.
The Committee on the Judiciary have at-
tempted to get a hearing on this matter, but
were put off.
I want to state one fact for the information
of the committee. The Committee on the
Judiciary of this House has never been called
this session upon the regular call of com-
mittees, except within five days after we came
here, and before we had time to prepare any
business whatsoever. Although by grace of
favor we obtained an hour one evening to
report, yet we have never been called since,
and therefore we have not been able to pre-
sent any of our business to this House, and
if we do anything it must be done on appro-
priation bills.
Now, one word more: there is Utah, where
bloodshed may come; there is Louisiana, where
we are told bloodshed is being inaugurated.
Bills upon those subjects have come from the
Senate, and yet there has not been a motion
made to go to business on the Speaker's table.
Mr. STEVENSON. The gentleman is mis-
taken; we went there once, passed a land-grant
bill, and, then stopped.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. We went
there for no purpose at all.
Mr. STEVENSON. We went there for a
bad purpose.
Mr. BUTLER, of Massachusetts. That is
worse than no purpose. I am not one of those
who are afraid of a March session, 1 am paid
by the year, and I mean to be paid enough, so
that I may be willing to stay until all my work
* Beport of the Commissioner of Internal Reve-
nue.
is ddne, and not be! obliged to go home before.
I mean to be paid enough so as not. to have to
wofk at nights and on Sundays in the business
of legislation. It is now Friday at one o'clock.
After to-day thete are but two full legislative
days, Saturday and Monday, remaining; and we
cannot conclude the necessary legislative bus-
iness of the country by the time the Speaker's
hammer shall fall next- Tuesday.- ' It is the
business of Congress to attend to the legis-
lation whioh the country requires; and l am
willing to stay here to do it'. I should be Very
glad to go home; but being paid, as I have
said, by the year j I 'am ready to remain here as
l6ng as may be necessary. I do not desire an
extra sessibn ; but I do desire that the legisla-
tive business of the country shall not, be wholly
overlooked and overslaughed. Among othet
matters needing legislation, your judicial dis-
tricts need reinodeling; yet the Committee oh
the Judiciary cannot" get- a hearing on that
subject.
[Here the hammer fell.]
Mr. COX. Mr. Speaker, I want to put
in my protest as one member of this House
against increasing my own salary by my own
vote. When we 'were elected to Congress
there was an itoplied contract between us and
the people that-we should serve for so much.
Mr. GARFIELD, 'of Ohio. I mast make
the point of order that gentlemen must confine
themselves to the subject under discussion.
Mr. COX. Why, sir, the debate has been
takings very wide range.
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. That is what
I complain of.
Mr. COX. Why did not the gentleman
make that point on some gentlemen upon his
cSwn side?
Mr. GARFIELD, of Ohio. Well, I give
notice that after the gentleman shall have con-
cluded I shall make the point and insist
upon it.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
New York will proceed.
Mr. COX. I do not. see how I can "pro-
ceed" with so large a procession of members
talking at the same time. [Laughter.]
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair requests
members to suspend conversation.
Mr. DICKEY. I raise the point of order
upon the gentleman from New York [Mr.
Cox] that the discussion of congressional sal-
aries is not proper upon an amendment relat-
ing to General Babcock's clerks.
The CHAIRMAN. The Chair overrules the
point of order; for the difference between a
first-class clerk and a second-class clerk de-
pends solely upon the salary. [Laughter.]
Mr. COX. I do not propose to discuss the
salaries of first class clerks or second-class
clerks. I wish to say that I do not think it
seemly for members of this House to vote
money into their own pockets; and I do not
believe the people will send us back if we do.
Mr. NEGLEY. They have not sent yon
back anyhow. [Laughter.]
Mr. COX. It is true that I am one of those
who are not coming back in the next Con-
gress ; yet I always come here just after some-
body else has voted _ to raise salaries. But I
never refused to -take anything which a grate-
ful country had voted to me in raising sal-
aries; and I never will. [Laughter.]
But, Mr. Chairman, I do not think the point
was very kindly made upon this side of the
House by the gentleman from California, [Mr.
Sargent,] who draws such a magnificent mile-
sige in addition to his salary. I t.hink he un-
dertook to make a sort of political point on
this side.
Mr. SARGENT. Nothing in my language
implied such an intention: and it never en-
tered my mind.
Mr. COX. Then I congratulate the gentle-
man on the improvement in his speeches.
Mr. SARGENT. I cannot improve by the
example of the gentleman, for he always
brings in party.
