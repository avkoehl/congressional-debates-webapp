CHATTANOOGA, September 6.

With the exception of a few shells thrown at our pontoons yesterday, nothing occurred to break the monotony at this place. The enemy seems quite active both above and below the place, but there is no further indication of an attack. The best informed persons think that no attack will be made here, but an effort will be made to flank us. Two privates, of the Fourth Regulars, and 1 of Rosecrans' telegraph operators were captured yesterday near Running Water Bridge.

ATLANTA, September 7.

Passengers from Chattanooga report of force of the enemy at Wauhatchie - number not known. We learn from Rome that another force is advancing on that point. All accounts concur in stating that the feeling and disposition of the army is one of great desire to meet the enemy, and confidence in the result. From East Tennessee no recent movement to report.

Richmond Enquirer, 8th instant,says:

ATLANTA, September 7.

A few of the enemy are at Wauhatchie, and another force advancing on Rome, Ga.
