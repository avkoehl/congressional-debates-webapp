COTTONWOOD HOUSE, March 17, 1865.

SIR: I have the honor to report that on the 7th instant a party of twenty-four citizens left here in search of a band of Indians who have been engaged in stealing stock from this neighborhood for some time past. They continued down to John Day's River, driving the Indians before them. On the 12th they induced several of the Indians to come into their camp, and through them on the 14th nineteen warriors, five squaws, and four children came into their camp. The citizens intended to bring in the whole baud, the chief agreeing to the arrangement and apparently perfectly satisfied, but instead of doing as he promised, at the first opportunity he gave a signal when they all broke and ran. The citizens then commenced firing on them, killing 12 and wounding nearly all the rest. Two squaws were accidentally killed besides. The citizens captured 23 horses and mules, 3 guns, and about 50 pounds of ammunition. None of the whites were injured. I believe it would be well to leave this detachment here for the present, for should the Indians be able to gather a sufficient force to attack the road, this would very likely be the first point.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. M. HAND,

First Lieutenant, First Oregon Cavalry.

Sir: I have the honor to report for the information of the commanding general that advises from the expedition in the field under Captain O'Regan were received yesterday under date of the 11th instant. The news is very gratifying, as he reports that a detachment of his men encountered a party of thieving Indiad in killing 5 warriors and in capturing 4 head stolen cattle, and some women and children, which they took to camp. On a previous scout they killed 3 Indians. The captain sent in requesting subsistence for the support of his prisoners, but owing to the large demands now made upon Government for subsistence for destitute emigrants and Indians in this vicinity I directed the release of the Indians. The command is now encamped on Catherine Creek awaiting supplies. These were dispatched from the post to-day. I sent subsistence to the 20th proximo,
