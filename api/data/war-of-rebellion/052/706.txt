GENERAL: On yesterday I was ordered to mass my troops between Pond Spring and Gower's. I find General Thomas' troops now on the road. I am at General Crittenden's headquarters at Alley's, and will await your order. I cannot mass my troops between Pond Spring and Gower's and at the same time protect Catlett's, Dug, and Blue Bird Gaps. My line will be long. I think me demonstration in front is cavalry. Please answer immediately.
