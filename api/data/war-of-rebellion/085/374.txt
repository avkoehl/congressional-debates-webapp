Major FRANK W. MARSTON:

SIR: On the 28th of Augusta Generals Polignac and Walker left Harrisonburg and moved in the direction of Monroe, La. Colonel Harrison is the only one there now. He has got only 250 men, with some sick, belonging to those other brigades. The cavalry also have moved in the same direction. This news I received from Lieutenant W. F. Vermilya, of the Thirty-sixth Iowa Infantry. He has just made his escape from Marshall, Tex., and came by Harrisonburg to Natchez. This news is correct.
