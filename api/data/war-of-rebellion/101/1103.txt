CAPE GIRARDEAU, MO., March 6, 1865.

Lieutenant-Colonel HILLER,

Bloomfield, Mo.:

Can I sen a scout out (in Bollinger County they report some guerrillas about Smithville) and then instruct them to go in below Dallas and look for Bolin in that direction? Captain Diehl being out from below, they will not expect any one from the north. I can send twenty men.
