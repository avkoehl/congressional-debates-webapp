GENERAL: In accordance with your verbal instructions given at Washington City the 27th of June last, I have the honor to inclose herewith a report of the operations of your department at Savannah and in North Carolina while supplying General Sherman's army last winter and spring.* The delay which has occurred in rendering this report has been unavoidable on my part, and has been caused by the difficulty of procuring the statements of property issued from the officers who had it in charge.
