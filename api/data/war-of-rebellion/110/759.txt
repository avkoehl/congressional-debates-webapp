Brigadier-General JACKSON,

Commanding Cavalry:

GENERAL: I sent Lieutenant Taylor to the railroad yesterday evening to learn the locality and movements of the enemy and he will return this evening.

I will send you the earlies news I have from the enemy's infantry. Please let me hear the news with you.

Your order was imperative to move on the road above mentioned, but I think the circumstances warrant me in holding the road until I can hear further from you.

L. S. ROSS,

Brigadier-General.
