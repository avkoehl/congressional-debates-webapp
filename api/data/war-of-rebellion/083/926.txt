Numbers 1. Report of Brigadier General Robert A. Cameron, U. S. Army, commanding District of La Fourche.

THIBODEAUX, November 19, 1864.

(Received 11 a. m.)

MAJOR: The party I sent out to destroy the guerrillas and raid boats had a glorious success. They landed yesterday morning under command of Major Miller 200 strong at Bayou Portage, at the head of Lake Fausse Pointe. They found Murphy's, Whittaker's, and King's companies watching the boats. They attacked them, whipped them, destroyed the boats, their baggage, and their barracks, and returned. They learned that Lieutenant Shafer, with part of the boats, was on a raiding expedition, and that Houma was their supposed destination. I have ordered the company of cavalry from Terre Bonne to proceed to Houma immediately, and will have another company sent off from this place immediately.
