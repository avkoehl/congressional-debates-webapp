PETERSBURG, VA., June 5, 1863.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON.

Secretary of War, C. S. A.:

General [J. G.] Martin writes from Greenville, N. C., that the Yankees are fitting out three expeditions to cut the railroad.

I have no doubt that they will attempt that or devastating raids. In view of these threatened movements, and the deficiency of transportation and consequent inability to move troops rapidly, I must renew the opinion that the line of the Blackwater ought to be abandoned, and the troops brought back to Petersburg and Weldon.

I can see no possible good of keeping them in their present position, and we may sustain a heavy disaster by it.

Respectfully,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS FIRST ARMY CORPS, June 5, 1863.

Major-General McLAWS,Commanding Division:

GENERAL: Your note of this date is received. The commanding general desires you to move your command to this point. If you find that General Ewell`s corps is in your way, you may wait until it has passed, and then follow on without delay.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. MOXLEY SORREL,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
