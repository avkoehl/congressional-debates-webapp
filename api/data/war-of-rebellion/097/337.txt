HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-1 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Warren reports by staff officer that Ayres' advance on White Oak road was repulsed. Ayres fell back to Crawford, the enemy following and attacking both Ayres and Crawford and compelling both to fall back to Griffin. Here the enemy was checked, the fighting still continuing. General Warren expresses confidence in his ability to hold his present position. Miles has been ordered to be prepared to support Warren. Humphreys will be ordered to attack as soon as I can communicate with him by telegraph, if the affair is not over by that time.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

GRAVELLY RUN, March 31, 1865-1 p. m.

Major-General MEADE,

At Fifth Corps Headquarters:

If the enemy has been checked in Warren's front, what is to prevent him from pitching in with his whole corps and attacking before giving him time to intrench or return in good order to his old entrenchments? I do not understand why Warren permitted his corps to be fought in detail. When Ayres was pushed forward he should have sent other troops to their support.

U. S. GRANT.
HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-1.15 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Your dispatch of 11.40 [11.50] relative to Humphreys advancing on his front received. As soon as I reached the field I met General Humphreys on the Boydton plank, and it was determined between us not to attack on his front, but to put all his available troops under Miles, to move forward from his left and attack the enemy in front of Warren in flank. This was done, and the enemy compelled to fall back. Warren is preparing to advance his whole force in conjunction with Miles, and will endeavor to drive the enemy back to and across the White Oak road. Any movement of the cavalry on his left will materially aid this operation.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-1.30 p. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

In answer to your telegram of inquiry about Warren pushing ahead, I send you a report just received from him, which will explain itself.* I infer that both Ayres and Crawford's divisions cannot be relied on for a great deal to-day. We will push all we can.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
