The siege of Vicksburg was a contest which tried more the endurance and resolution of the men and their company and regimental commanders than the sill of their generals.

My men during the siege did their duty and their whole duty to the entire satisfaction of their general, and I trust of their country. The patience with which my troops submitted to the many privations and hardships to which they were sustained throughout, are worthy of all praise, and merited a better fortune.

The casualties ining the siege were as follows: Hebert's brigade-killed, 203, wounded, 480. Moore's brigade-killed, 72; wounded, 385. Total-killed, 275; wounded, 865*.

I inclose herewith the reports of the brigade commanders.

I have the honor to be, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JNumber H. Forney,

Major-General.

Major R. W. MEMMINGER,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
