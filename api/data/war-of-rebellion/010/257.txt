larize would seem invidious; suffice it to say the officers, with on or two exceptions, are deserving the highest praise. The men were at all times cool and as free from fear or confusion as if they were on dress-parade.

The list of casualties,which I appended below, fully attests the severity of the contest.

The following is the number of killed, wounded, and missing in the two days' engagement:*

Killed ................................................... 64

Wounded .................................................. 100

Missing .................................................. 47

Soon after my pickets sent in word that a force, with artillery, were advancing on the Back road.
