Your telegram received. Colonel Sweitzer is safe. I have just received his report of the affair, which will be forwarded the first opportunity. He had three men wounded and three horses captured of his escort. His regiment turned out and scoured the country to Aldie. The cavalry ordered from your headquarters last night will leave here in an hour, under Lieutenant-Colonel Clendenin, for the Loudoun Valley.

Assistant Adjutant-General.
HEADQUARTERS MIDDLE MILITARY DIVISION, Winchester, December 20, 1864.

Brigadier-General STEVENSON:

I cannot see why General Seward should be so much worried. He has two regiments, and there is also a brigade at Stephenson's Depot, one at crossing of Opequon and at Summit Point, and cavalry. There is a daily scout to Pughtwon. Every regiments I have, except my own personal escort, is on its way to Lynchburg. I will send a regiment to General Seward as soon as I get one. Augur's cavalry is over about Salem, in Londoun Country, to-day.

P. H. SHERIDAN,Major-General.
