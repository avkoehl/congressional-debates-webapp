SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Major-General HEINTZELMAN,

Columbus, Ohio:

It is certain that Shelby, with 4,000 men, is at Fredericktown, Mo., twenty-one miles east of Pilot Knob, and that Price, with a large mounted force-put by their own people at 15,000-arrived there on Saturday night. I want every veteran you can spare me from Cairo.

Can you send arms?

W. S. ROSECRANS,

Major-General.

COLUMBUS, September 26, 1864.

General W. S. ROSECRANS:

Cairo is not under my command, and I do not know what force is there. I am sorry I cannot spare a man from my department.

Brigadier General H. E. PAINE, Springfield, Ill.:

Have you any veterans you can spare me for an emergency, either at Cairo or elsewhere? If so, send them with all dispatch to Saint Louis. We may need and can use them to great advantage.

One veteran regiment, 250 strong, is here ready to return to the field. Will you have it? It could start to-morrow. There are also 3,000 100-days' troops awaiting muster, and will you have them?

H. E. PAINE,

Brigadier-General.

SAINT LOUIS, MO., September 26, 1864.

Brigadier General H. E. PAINE, Springfield, Ill.:

Yes. Send what yo can spare at once. They will be met on the opposite side of the river by a staff officer. Ask the 100-days' men in my name if they will come. Please telegraph me when they will come.

No time should be lost.

Major-General.
