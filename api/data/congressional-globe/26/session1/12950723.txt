Freedom of Elections—Mr. Randolph.'
H. of Reps.
bably sever hav  Heen a contest further than (he appearance of
th« gentlemen holding the commission  for the purpose of sur-
rendering them to the House
The law, said Mr R defining the elective franchise In New
Jersey was too plain to be mistaken, it declares that "no person
shall Tote, unless such person be a free white "male cituten of
this State, of the age of twenty-one years, "who shall have paid
a tax, and hatk resided m Mi county "trAereAe claims a
vteforai least one year immediately proceeding the elec
titM." Ym, notwithstanding the plainness of this act, and the
still more explicit preamble to the act ofl&W, the election offi
cera of Millville gravely decided that aliens had a right to vote.
The language of the preamble to the act of 1807, which first
defined the. qualifications of voters in the very language of the
act in force in 1838, was remarkable    It reads thus
"Whereas doubts hav¿ been raised, and great diversifies of
practice obtained throughout the State in regard to the admis-
sion of aliens, females, ami persons of color, or negroes to
vote in elections, as also in regard to the mode of ascertaining
the qualifications of voters m respect to estate, and whereas
it «highly necessary to the safety, quiet, good order, and dig-
nity of the State to clear up the said doubts by an act of the
Represéntate es of the people, declaratory of the true sense and
meaning of the Constitution, and to ensure its just execution in
these particulars, according to the intent of the framers thereof
7%ere/ore, be it enacted," $c
Clear and exp'ictt as were the provisions of the law, settled
without a dissenting voice from lawyer or politician for moro
than thirty years, as it has been, yet (Strange to say, on the morn-
ing of October 9, IS38, anew light, was shed over the State of
New Jersey, and the electron officers of Millville,South Amboy,
and various other townships throughout the State as it were
by preconcert, decided that aliens had a right to vote, and they
received their votes accordingly, at they had a large number of
votes from non residents and other disqualified persons
The atixem of Nejy Jersey, sir, feel perfectly competentto
decide their own electi ns w about the aid of aliens, and history
will reprobate the conduct of that man or that party who calls
in their assistance to decide the balance of political power
But to the township of Millville    The decision of the ele
uon officers led to some strange íesults, as would appear from
the facts elicited on the Cumberland investigation  before the
Legislature.   He would read a paragraph or two
Page 8 —Q. Did a majority of the judges and inspectors de-
clare that they would receive the votes of alien*, if they were
inhabitants of the township, and had paid a tax, or words to
that effect                                         K
A They did, if they had resided in the county a yeat, I did
not hear any thing said about paying a tax.

Q. Where was you borní
A. In France I voted at the last election in Millville. I
have not been naturalized I don't remember any of the
names—"gold and silver I know—the paper I knows him not"
—I was born where the gold and silver was, and I still i'ke it
the beat. I voted that ticket because I wanted a bank to bring
more gold andsilver—the ticket I voted was called some kind
of a "c rat" ticket—I don't know whatkind ofa "crat"
Here, sir, is a specimen of the votes by which the majority of
Cumberland county was controlled, and attempts made to
control the State—tbey are almost equal to Mr Samuel Weller's
independent voters of Eatonville, only, as the New Jersey elec
tion was by ballst instead of cita voce, it was not necessary
that they should be pumped onto qualify them for the exercise
of the elective franchise
At the last election aliens were not permitted to vote in
Millville; and notwithstanding the most determined exertion,
the vote few short foriv-four votes, or one sixth of the entire
vote—more than sufficient to have elected one of his colleagues
He would add, also, that the South Amboy vote had diminished
although a member of those who voted there last year have
since been naturalized
Mr R would appeal, then, to gentlemen, if this was a case
(ifsuchacasecan ever be) m which the clerk should have
stretched the law and his power to have received the return?
He thought not, the letter of the law, as well as its spirit and
the principles of right and justice, were against it, and against
either tlie possession or the exercise ef any such discretion of
the clerk
In the ease of Moore tí. Letcher, Hocker, in violation of
law and his duty, withheld the return of his county, because he
alleged that there were illegal votes included in the return from
another county in the district, and yet his conduct was not
only justified by the then President, who, shortly after, appointed
him toan important office, but hy the acts and votes of his
political lriends on this floor, amongst whom was Philemon
Dickerton, one of the contestants Will gentlemen then
justify an officer in violating his duty and the law to keep out a
legal return, because another return contains some votes
against them, alleged to have been illegal, and then turn round
and require other officers to violate the law and their duty in
order to get tn an illegal return covering a large number of
alien and illegal vote3 in their favoi ? Are gentlemen prepared
for this?
The law of New Jersey requires that the clerks of the re-
spective counties shall, on Saturday after the election, at 6
o'clock, p m "made one general list of all the candidates voted
for as aforesaid, together with the number of votes receiredfor
each of them, and shall transmit the same" to the Givernoc
within seven day thereafter The law is notso absurd, sir, as to
require the cleik to include in his "general list" all the vetes
received by each cand date, whe'her the election has been held
or the return made according to law or not, but he is to include
such votes only as are taken and returned according to law and
by him "received for each candidate," and "the same' general
"list" thus made out, nothing more anr1 nothing less, is to be
transmitted to the Governor T'ie law neither requires nor
authorizes any thing different, and certainly no morai obligation
can go further and require an extra off cial return of those
townships which were not legally returned to him, especially
when they covered frauds and illegal votes, wh'Ch might be
investigated by another tribunal, though not by him And if
such extra official statement had been added, according to the
decision of the Governor and Council in 1828, it could not have
been noticed in the final account
Mr R said it had been intimated that oth.. r townships were
as defective in their returns as were Mil, filie and South Amboy,
•nd he had understood that the clerks who received and trans
muted them had endeavored to get them back from the Go-
vernor in order to have them stricken from their "general
lists," although no frauds or illegal votes had been alleged in
those townships Whether either of these allegations was true,
he knew not, but would leave them as he had heard them, with
the single remark, which ha would in candor make, that he had
heard that at some elections there had been cases where the
clerks had stepped over the law, and received returns not
made in exact accordance with the statue, but those, if there
were such, being from townships where no frauds had occurred
or illegal votes received and where no objections had been
made, formed no precedent for cases like Millville and South
Amboy The clerk must go according to law, without discre
tion, but if he ever chose to bend its provisions to receive the
retnrn of legal votes, that surely constituted no precedent and
no reason why he should do the same thing to receive the illegal
return of illegal votes The clerks of all the counties in the
State transmitted their "general li«ts" to the Governor within
I  the time prescribed, that from Middlesex was made out in
|   the usual lorm adopted in that county,  and according to the
[    form used by the clerk of Somerset in  1836, specifying the
I different townships, the former writing opposite South Amboy
thus, "From this township no return according to law was
received," the latter stating opposite Montgomery, ' no return,"
although a legal return was made and transmitted, and reached
the clerk after five o'clock    The "general list" from Cumber
,  land was according to the uniform  practice in that county,
giving the aggregate  of votes for each candidate, without
specifying townships      Either   mode was according to the
statute and the practice adoptedin different counties
We will now (said Mr R ) look at the proteedines before
. the Governor and Council, premising that, even if the clerks
erred, which they did not, the decision of the Governor and
Council was correct, unless they, instead of this House, had
the legal power to remedy the evil    This position is thus laid
i  down in Spaulding vs. Mead page 163
"Suppose he (the returning officer) had i (fustd all the votes
' given for a candidate [in several counties, the Governor could
not pay any attention to these votes, for his certificate must
11 be founded exclusively on the votes returned to him, he
1' would be obliged, thtrelore, to certify as duly plected the person
I having the highest number of such vote*, although it might be
. proved that the suppressed votes, if counted, would have
' I  given the highest number to another candidate "
|      The law requires, sir, that—
I "The Governor or person administering the Government of
this State shall, within five days afterreceiving the said list, lay
the same before a Privy Council, to be by him summoned for
that purpose, and, after casting up the whole number of votes
fiom the se* eral counties foreach candidate, the said Governor or
person administering the Governmentand Privy Council shall
determine the six persons who have the greatest number of
votes from the whole State for Representatives in the Congress
of the United States from this State, which six persons the Go
vernor or person administering the Government shall forthwith
commission, under the great seal of the State to represent this
State in the House of Representatives of theUnittd States
during" the Congress for which they were elected.
The Governor was authorized to select any three of the
legislative Council (or State Senate) to be his Privy Council,
he summoned the whole seventetn, and laid before them the
"lists" received from the seventeen county clerks He deli
vered on that occasion the able opinion which has been pub
lished, and after a year's reflection, in his recent message,
which has been much misrepresented in this House and out of
it, he states that, although "it would have been agreeable to his
feelings could the necessity for action on his part have been dis
pensed with," yet, he adds, "every review of the opinion ex
presssd at that time has only confirmed me m the belief
that the law was faithfully declat ed," and the whole message
was in accordance with that declaran n
Two questions were raised, sir, before the Governor and
Privy Council The first was, that it was the duty of (he
Governor, under the statute, to have sent expresses and got in
the return of votes frem Millville and Sou h Amboy That
statute reads as follows, viz
"If the certifiedlists of votes given for electors of President
and Vice President, and of Representatives of this State in the
Congress of the United State?, shall not be received from the
clerks of any oj the counties of this State by the Governor, or
person administering the Government within seven days after
the day prescribed by law for the casting up of the votes,
making a list thereof, and certifying the same, by the clerks
of the respective counties in ifus State, it shall be the du-
ty of the Governor forthwith to send express to the clerk
of the county or couities from which surh certified lists of
cotes have not been received, and to procure the same "
The requirement of this clause in the statute Is very plain
and simple, and its object was to remedy an evil which are «n in
the first New Jersey contested case under the statute of 1787
That act has no such clause, and the Governor had no power to
get in the lists or returns from the diffeient counties, ho and h s
Council could only adjourn from day to day, and wait a reasona
ble time, as they did in that case, but owing to the neglect or
misconduct of the returning officer, in the county of Essex, the
votes of that county never got in or were counted, and this
caused the contested election For the township return, sn, the
statute makes provision, by requiring its rejection if not sent in
within the prescribed time, for the county return, which was
the only one the Governor could recognise, there was no
remedy if it was not transmitted in time, the statute did not,
like that of the township, reject it, nor was any person empow
ered to get until this statute authorized the Governor to send
an express to the clerkt and get the "general list" made out by
*.
him Well, as in this case, all the ..si had bren transmitted to
the Governor n due time, there was nothing fir which he
could send, and, If he had sent, it must be to 'he clerk who had
already transmitted his list, and, of course, he amid only get
the same thing The Governor had no po^erto send beyond
the c!erk,or, even lfhe differed in judgment with him,tocom
gel him to  a ter his return or send a different list      The
lovernor, then, hav ing ro power to "xucise tender this law,
of course exercised rot e
Mr R said that, although there had been several cases in
New Jersey where the cwrk s lists did not contain all tne votes
of all the townships, yet there never was a case where th 
Governor had sent beyond the clerk, oi had attempted to get
any other returns than those sent him bv the tlerks, such an
idea was never advanced til) the piesent case occurred The
cases before relerred to, whith occurred in 1822, 1828 and 1836,
all proved this The latter was a remarkable case This
clerk of Somerset, a prominent supporter of the Admmistia-
uon, made out the "general list" of his county, leaving out the
votes of Montgomery township because it was not returned
before five o'clock Th s township gave a majority for the
distinguished gentleman aero s the House, (Mr Grander ) and
the distinguished statesman of Ohio as well as for himself and
colleagues, and he w<ts informed by one of the Pi ivy Council
who officiated on that occasion, that he had distinctly raised the
question under this statute, whether it was not the duty of the
Governor to send an express for the votes of the missing town
ship, and that the Governor examined the law, and decided
that the statute did not apply, and that he had no power under
Uto send the express, and the Privy Council concurred in that
opinion, a majority of whom were the leac1 rg supporters
of the Administration in New Jerse> That Governor, sir, who
made that decision, was Philemon Dickbrson now here
claiming his seat It is true, sir, encum'tances have chanced,
Mr Dickebson ceased to be Governor .and became a candidate
forCongress, and, in counting the reiuins, the sime question
had occurred, and the same decision which Gov ei nor D had
made against him (Mr R ) and his colleagues was applied to
Mr D and his associates, and now it is alleged to be erroneous
and fraudulent'
This point, however, (said Mr R ) was considered so plain
and self evident that the honorable Senator, (Mr Wail) «ho
argued the matter before the Governor and Council, seems to
have placed but little oi no reliance on it, he raised another
question, and insisted that the Governor and Council should
then receive the certificates of votes from Millville and South
Amboy and count them—aliens and all This the Governor
and Council decided that they had no right to do, their duty
was plainly and explicitly staled in the statute—it was simply
to "cast up" the votes, and "determine," from the "general
lists" of theclerks, "who bad the greatest number of votes in
ihe whole State, ' eUe the illegal return of an election held on a
w ong day, by persons neither chosen nor sworn, and who
received in indefinite number of illegal votes, might be re
ceived No authority is given them or intended tobe given
them, by the statute, io go beyond those lists or procure o'har
evidence The Governor can receive nothine but what comes
from the county clerk, and that only can he lay before the Privy
Council, and from that only can they determine They have
no power to swear witnesses orto send to or beyond the c crk
If they had received the certificates and affidavits of the election
officers of Millville and South Amboy to prove tha (Messrs

enormous power conferred on them? Never The county
clerks have the sam% power in lemming1 members to the

It was as destitute oi precedent to sanction it as it was of princi-
ple to support it The Governor and Council having deter
mined that himself (Mr R ) and colleagues were elected,
they were commissioned accoidingly That commission did
not, it is true, state by what vote the person holding it was
elected, nor did that of the Chief Justice, or of any other State
officer—all of which he believed were in the same form, but it
was conclusive, until the House, in the regular exercise of its
constitutional power, determined that < thers malead of his
co leagues were entitled to their ceats, it was the determination
ofa competent, constitutional tribunal—not a meie certifica e
