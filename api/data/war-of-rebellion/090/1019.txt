followed on the morning of the 19th, Ramseur's division in front, our advance occasionally reaching the enemy's rear guard, which burned all the bridges on the way and so impeded our progress some. They also destroyed the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad as much as possible. Breckinridge's division marched by the "Forest" road. Ramseur had a lively skirmish with the enemy near Liberty (see plate ---*), after which the army encamped near there (see plate ---* for routes from Lynchburg to Liberty).

June 20, the infantry, Gordon in front, followed after the enemy to Buford's Gap, skirmishing with the rear. At the gap the enemy made a show of resistance, and dispositions were made (as in plate ---*) to flank him from his position, but the movement was so slow that night came before it was accomplished, and we encamped in the gap, the enemy in our front. Major Gilmor's cavalry made a detour to the left, captured some of the enemy, and drove them from a signal station. Most of the cavalry marched from Liberty by the Peaks Gap to Buchanan to thwart the enemy's movements in the Valley. June 21, the enemy continued his retreat and we followed at rather a late hour, Rodes in advance, to the vicinity of Hanging Rock, or Mason's Gap, leaving the main road at Big Lick to try and reach the gap before the enemy (for route, see plate ---*). Imboden's cavalry crossed the Blue Ridge southwest of Buford's Gap and came upon the enemy's rear at Big Lick and followed them through Salem and Mason's Gap. The infantry reached Hanging Rock after the enemy had passed and encamped in the vicinity. The cavalry, under General Ransom, attacked the enemy's line of march at Hanging Rock at 11 a. m., and in the vicinity of Salem (see plate ---*), having made a night march from Buchanan, and cut their line of march, capturing artillery, wagons, &amp; c., part of which they were compelled to destroy, being forced back by superior numbers of the enemy, who continued their retreat to Mason's Cove (see plate ---+). June 22, the troops remained in camp, only [except] Ramseur's division, which moved to the vicinity of Botetourt Springs. Imboden's cavalry continued the pursuit of the enemy toward New Castle. The rest of the cavalry marched to the vicinity of Fincastle. June 23, the army marched to Buchanan Ramseur in advance, and on the 24th to Buffalo Creek, not far from Lexington, moving by two roads (see plate ---*). The enemy continued his retreat toward Lewisburg, followed by a few cavalry. Our cavalry marched, as shown in plate ---,* and encamped near Collierstown. June 25 and 26, the army continued the march by two roads, where practicable (see plate ---*), to the vicinity of Staunton. On the 27th the infantry rested and the cavalry continued the march (see plate ---#). June 28, Ramseur and Rodes marched, by Mount Sidney and the Keezletown road, to the vicinity of North River, while Gordon and Breckinridge followed the Valley turnpike to near the same stream. The cavalry marched by the Back road. June 29, the army marched to the vicinity of Sparta, Ramseur in advance, and on the 30th, Gordon in advance, to near Hawkinstown, and July 1 he led the march to Fisher's Hill, the cavalry coming by the Middle road, and encamped on Hupp's Hill.

July 2, we marched to the vicinity of Winchester, Gordon in front (see plate ---#). July 3, Gordon and Breckinridge marched to
