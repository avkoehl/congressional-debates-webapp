Lieutenant JOHN B. MAITLAND,

Actg. Asst. Adjt. General, 2nd Brigadier, 2nd Div., Cav. Corps:

SIR: I have the honor to honor to report that I scouted the country thoroughly between our lines and our infantry picket-lines this side of the river. I learned nothing of the enemy until I reached a point opposite Fox's Ford, where I found one of the Eighteenth Pennsylvania Cavalry Regiment, who informed me that his regiment had a sharp skirmish with a small party of the enemy 1st night. About three-fourths of a mile farther I came to our infantry picket-line and saw the brigade officer of the day, from whom I learned that an infantry scouting party had been to Sulphur Springs
