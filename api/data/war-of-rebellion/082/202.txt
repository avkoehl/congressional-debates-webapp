Mr. Ould requests that an answer be sent to him at 1 p.m. to-morrow whether the parties will be able to meet him at the time stated in his communication; also, it the place is agreeable. I would request that Ruffin's house be substituted for Mrs. Grover's, the latter being one of my reserve picket stations.
