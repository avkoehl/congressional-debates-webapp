I will go now to the light-houses, and quote j
from " the list of light-houses, beacons, and float-
ing-lights of the United States, prepared by Stephen
Pleasonton, Fifth Auditor and General Superin-
tendent of Lights." There have been built two
hundred and "thirty light-houses at an aggregate
cost of §1,512,812, viz :
66 lights built, up to the year 1820.. $470,000 00
130 lights built, up to the year 1842.. 792,800 00
34 lights built, up to the year 1852.. 250,000 00
t $1,512,800 00
To this should be added four lights in
process of erection by the topo-
graphical bureau, for which there
has already been appropriated.... 354,976 00
Also costs of forty-two floating-lights:
34 lights, up to the year 1842  300,478 79
8 lights, up to the year 1852  77,252 77
Adding these items together, we have
expended on the light-house sys-
tem, on the Atlantic coast §2,245,507 56
I come now to the Navy-Yards and Docks:—

It will he perceived that I confine myself exclu-
sively to the Atlantic coast, excluding the Gulf of
Mexico and the Lakes, and that in this Atlantic
coast is included the peninsula of Florida, running
like a finger post for hundreds of miles into the
ocean, covering no ex4ensive or important back
country; and we have already expended—

I will now turn to the Pacific.
The coast of California is  970 miles.
Oregon    500 "
Straits of Juan de Fuca  150 u
Makinga total for the Pacific coast of 1620 14
Nearly equal to the whole Atlantic coast, including
the peninsula of Florida. And what have you
expended on that extensive coast for fortifications,
light-houses, navy-yards, and docks? Not one
dollar! What have you appropriated? About
$150,000 for light-houses not yet commenced,
$>250,000 for a dock, to cost, when completed,
$610,000, and nothing for fortifications or a navy-
yard. Even the estimate for surveys for fortifi-
cations, of §50,000, made by the "War Depart-
ment, has been left out of the army appropriation
bill by the Committee of Ways and Means, which
is an indication that we are to have no fortifica-
tions there.
Here is my own State, of California, which paid
$3,212,127 79 into the Treasury from customs the
last fiscal year, with a sea-coast of 970 miles, con-
taining within her limits 188,981 square miles,
more than four times the size of the State of New
York, utterly destitute of light-house establish-
ments, necessary and indispensable to our commer-
cial marine in approaching her coasts. Here is the
Pacific Empire State destined to command the com-
merce of the Pacific and Asiatic seas, left wholly
unprovided for, in regard to works of protection
and defense. In the agitations and political com-
motions of European nations, we know not at
what hour we may find it necessary to place this
nation in an attitude of defence, even if only to
defend our neutral rights as a great maritime
power, to say nothing of the importance of con-
forming to the policy of Washington and his suc-
cessors, in time of peace to make proper prepara-
tion for war.
The honorable Senator has alluded to the war
of 1812 to show that we need no national defense.
I wish to call his attention to the historical fact that
the British sloop of war Racoon entered the port
of Astoria, in Oregon, and in the defenseless con-
dition of our rights there, formally took posses-
sion of the country in behalf of his Britannic Ma-
jesty, and changed the name of " Astoria " to
"Fort George." Thanks to the valiant spirits
that now occupy California and Oregon, no hos-
tile foot can ever trea^that soil with impunity;
yet who can estimate Tne extent of the mischief
and ruin that would be there inflicted by the pres-
ence of a powerful hostile fleet, left as the country
now is by the Government of the United States
wholly unprotected.
The Senator makes a comparison between our
country, during the war of 1812, and the present
time, and draws the inference that, as we needed
no defenses to protect our coast and commerce
then, they are useless notv. The Senator has cer-
tainly not looked at the commercial progress of
this country since the close of the war of 1812,
or he would have drawn no such inference. I
have examined the statistics of our commercial
marine, and find that since 18J5, (when the war
with Great Britain closed) to 1850, we have built
34,792 vessels, with a tonnage of 447,591,045 tons.
The registered whale fishery for the last twelve
years, to wit: from 1840 to 1851, had a tonnage of
2,038,177. The registered whale fishery for 1851,
had a tonnage of 181,645.
It is known that, perhaps with the exception of
a single ship that visits the Greenland seas, the
whale fishery is confined to the Pacific and South
seas. The proceeds of the sea for the year ending
June 13, 1850, from the whale fishery alone,
amounted to §2,318,024. Are no means to be pro-
vided for the protection and encouragement of this
valuable traffic? And are our possessions on the
Pacific coast to be deprived of all those facilities,
which aid in the exaltation of a State or nation,
through a miserable, parsimonious policy, on the
part of the General Government, which refuses to
extend to us proper aid, when we are advancing,
with giant strides, in all that constitutes real worth
and greatness ? So much for what the Government
has failed to do, to build up the commercial great-
ness of her Pacificpossessions. And when-we look
into the interior of* the country, we have but little
hope that a more liberal policyrwill be pursued to-
ward that section of the Union. We have no re-
liable evidence that we are to receive a grant of land
to encourage the great railway system that will
yet begirt this ocean-bound Empire, in order that
we may do our part in improving our State, devel-
oping its boundless resources, and connect us
with the Atlantic, by communications, as we are
m principle, in all that concerns the glory of this
Union.
Only twenty-five years have elapsed since the
railway system began in the United States. At
! the end of the year 1850, we had 8,797 miles of
I railway, which cost* $286,455,078. There were,
J up to the close of 1851, by estimate, 10,618 miles,
j and to the end of 1852, we have its extent esti-
I mated at 12,600—more than half the circumfer-
i ence of the globe! Does any one suppose that
J this great system of land communication will stop
! until it reaches the Pacific ocean? Then, with a t
j proper system of defense upon that coast, which
| will give us a permanent commercial ascendancy
! on the Pacific and Asiatic seas, the carrying trade
( between Asia and Europe will be within our ter-
j ritory,and enable us to control the commerce and
| exchanges of the world. Congiess has dealt lib-
i eraily and justly with the East, in land, money,
j and improvements. Let them deal m the same
! spirit with the West. We ask nothing more.
; The Senator says, that the commercial marine
: does not use the basin and railway. Preparations
are now making in New York to build one, to
avoid the expense of accumulating docks; to meet
the wants of our commercial marine. The Sena-
tor also objects to the mode of completing the title
for the site of the navy-yard; and supposes that
1 a California jury will not do justice to the United
States. He need be under no apprehensions on
, this subject, for the location of the navy-yard will
greatly enhance the value of the property sur-
rounding it, and the owners of property near ehgi-
; ble sites for its location will be most willing to give
quit claim to the United States for any amount
, of land needed for this purpose. I doubt very
■ much whether there is a man in California who
; would risk his title m a contest with the United
' States. Land titles in that country are not so
perfect as to court an issue of title with the Uni-
I ted States, for lands selected for public purposes.
