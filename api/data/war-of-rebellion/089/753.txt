Major General A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Commanding Second Corps:

GENERAL: The commanding general desires that the accompanying letter be sent to the enemy's lines by the flag of truce, at the same point on the right of Fort Cummings that the letter addressed to Lieutenant-General Grant, and forwarded with your communication of yesterday, was received.

[Inclosure.]
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,November 30, 1864.

Major General C. M. WILCOX, C. S. Army:

Your letter of the 28th instant has been referred to me by Lieutenant General U. S. Grant, with directions to reply to it. I regret extremely it is not in my power to accede to your request by returning to your lines Private R. A. Pryor, Third Virginia Cavalry. The same considerations which prevented you from applying to your commanding general preclude me from sanctioning this irregular intercourse between the opposing pickets, which is in direct violation of my orders, and for violating which and thus permitting himself to be captured in a similar manner, I recently dismissed Captain Burrage, of a Massachusetts regiment.*

Private Pryor will have to suffer the consequences of his imprudence. He will be held as a prisoner of war, and with all consideration due to his position.

I remain, general, with great respect, &amp;c.,

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
