rifle-pits incessant on both sides. Shells thrown into town, especially at night. Rebels reported to have mortars. South side of river open to us, and we forage on that side. Death of Brigadier-General Sanders confirmed. General Burnside was confident of holding his position. Couriers saw him in person, and now on the way with dispatches from Burnside for me. Reported to have rations for thirty-five or forty days. If there is any material difference in dispatch I will telegraph you when it is received. Great light seen by scout in direction of Knoxville last night. Supposed town on fire.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, November 24, 1863-10 a.m.

Major-General GRANT:

Your dispatches of 22nd and 23rd received. The first is unjust, as I will show you by my orders from Burnside. I will commence the movement directed in the second, and if there is the least chance of success, will make the demonstration toward Abingdon with mounted force, which Colonel Harney considers too unserviceable for the expedition.

Williams' troops stationed above watching me, and I will hold him as long as possible by my movement. Firing hear in direction of Knoxville last night.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

CUMBERLAND GAP, November 24, 1863-11.15 a.m.

Major-General GRANT:

A deserter came into my pickets at Walker's Ferry. He left the rebel army no Friday. His information is not accurate. He says Burnside has a very strong position, and that Longstreet's force is estimated at 50,000 men.

The rebels are at Evan's Ford, on Clinch River, to-day. This is probably the Rogersville force. There is also a force at Jonesville. Two hundred reported at Harlan Court-House.

What force is there in Kentucky to guard my line of communication and supplies?

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.

CHATTANOOGA, Tennessee, November 24, 1863.

Maj. General J. G. FORSTER:

Do you hear anything from Burnside? Battle here been raging since 2 p.m. yesterday. So far we have captured many prisoners and a part of Missionary and the point of Lookout Mountain.

U. S. GRANT,

Major-General.
