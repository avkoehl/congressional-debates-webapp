HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF THE CUMBERLAND,Tunnel Hill, May 11, 1864.

Colonel E. M. McCOOK,

Commanding First Division Calvary:

COLONEL: It has been decided to leave Howard's corps and yours and Stoneman's cavalry to keep up the feint of a direct attack on Dalton, while the remainder of the three armies move through Snake Creek Gap and attack the enemy from that quarter. The part assigned your cavalry in this movement is to proceed without delay to Ray's Gap and relieve Geary's division, of the Twentieth Corps, now guarding that pass, and allow it to join corps. Cars will continue to run to this place with daily supplies, from which you can draw yours. The main depot will, however, be at Ringgold. Should the enemy detect the diminution of force in his front and attack, you will withdraw gradually toward Ringgold and draw your supplies from there. Watch well Ray's Gap, that the enemy may not get through it upon our communications.

I am, colonel, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. D. WHIPPLE,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.
