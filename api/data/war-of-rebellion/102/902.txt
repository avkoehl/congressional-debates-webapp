think beef can be contracted for at 7 or 8 cents net. With the railroad repaired to Brasher, and Washington supplied for six months, all the steam transportation needed would be one or at most two small steamboats to run from Brashear to New Iberia, from which point communication can be kept up with Washington via Vermillionville and Opelousas. This boat can be dispensed with as soon as the regular packet line from Brashear to New Iberia is established.

I am, very respectfully, Your obedient servant,

HEADQUARTERS SOUTHERN DIVISION OF LOUISIANA,New Orleans, La., June 22, 1865.

Respectfully forwarded to department headquarters.

The suggestions concerning the stationing of the troops were anticipated in my communication to headquarters Department of the Gulf June 9, 1865, and ordered to be carried into effect June 13, 1865. The Sixteenth Indiana (mounted) Infantry, however, has been withdrawn since my report, and General Cameron's suggestion as to the disposition of the Third Rhode Island Cavalry will have to be carried out in case it be found that more cavalry is wanted on the Teche.
