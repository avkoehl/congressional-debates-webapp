APPENDIX TO THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
[July 23,
Ho. of Reps.
Imported Wool—Mr. Lawrence.
39th Cong.... 1st Sess.
Now, I insist upon an increase of duties on
the importation of these articles for several :
reasons: _ _
1. It is our policy to discourage their im- !
portal,ion. Tliey produce woolen goods which, j
when handsomely finished, may deceive the I
great mass of purchasers, and yet are noto- j
riously inferior in value and wearing capacity. |
During the recent Avar the soldiers had fre- j
quent occasion to complain of imposition prac- i
ticed upon them by clothing made in part of
"these imported rags.
Let England, then, manufacture her own
rags for her own people, and let us adopt such
a policy as will exclude foreign rags, either in
the form of rags, or when picked into fiber, or
in the form of fraudulent cloth.
2. This foreign trash when imported de-
stroys the business of the wool-grower here.
It must be remembered that in the manufac-
ture of cloth a pound of shoddy is more pro-
ductive than double its weight in wool. Wool
loses by washing and scouring, shoddy loses
nothing.
Every pound of shoddy imported drives out
of the market more than two pounds of wool,
perhaps three pounds. Yet foreign shoddy can
be imported at a cost in New York of notover
ten cents per pound.
If it be wise to levy duties on foreign wool,
it is wiser still to levy them on this foreign
fraud. I submit to the House a statistical ta-
ble showing the extent of the foreign trade in
this article. It is thus :

It should be remembered that we have Amer-
ican shoddy, and if it be desirable at all let us
patronize the home article. From woolens and
cloths imported and produced in this country,
it would seem the supply of shoddy would be
more than sufficient to answer every demand
required by the real interests of the people.
1 have already remarked that I did not pro-
pose to discuss in detail the policy of a tariff.
That lias been sufficiently done. But for the pur-
pose of illustrating this whole subject as affect-
ing the producers, manufacturers, and consum-
ers of wool and woolen goods, I present in this
connection statistical tables, prepared with great
eare, and which I trust will be of value in the
considerationofthisandkindredsubjects. They
are as follows:

The exports, as heretofore, are of trifling
amount. The woolen goods of American man-
ufacture were scarcely deemed worthy of special
enumeration until 1864.
