At 8 p. m. the following not addressed to General Grant was received:

"CITY POINT, VA., February 1, 1865.

"Lieutenant-General GRANT:

"SIR: We desire to got to Washington City to confer informally with the President personally, in reference to the matters mentioned in his letter to Mr. Blair of the 18th of January ultimo, without any personal compromise on any question in the letter. We have the permission to do so from the authorities in Richmond.

At 9.30 p. m. I notified that they could not proceed further unless they complied with the terms expressed in my letter.
