SWIFT CREEK, June 14, 1864 - 10 a. m.

General BRAXTON BRAGG:

Following dispatch has just been sent to General Lee:

Petersburg cannot be re-enforced from my small force in lines of Bermuda Hundred Neck without abandoning entirely that position. Re-enforcements should first reach there before detaching these troops, which, possessing local knowledge, should be preferably, retained where they are. Should you not have a pontoon bridge below Chaffin's Bluff?

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

Lieutenant Woodley reports from Ivor that four large ocean steamers and seven large river steamers went up this 6 a. m. with troops. Three steamers went up last night, supposed loaded with troops. Same steamers that went down on Saturday with pontoons returned yesterday with same pontoons, about 150 yards long. Another with as many pontoons and with troops went up this morning. Steamer Thomas Powell with horses and a few men went up yesterday. Several small steamers with schooners went up yesterday evening and this morning. There is a considerable fleet of schooners and rigged vessels at Newport New. Two more river steamers passed up just as he was leaving.
