MAY 24, 1862-3.30 p. m.

Major-General BANKS, Winchester:

Large re-enforcements are being sent via Harper's Ferry and Manassas. Hope to have sufficient near Front Royal to cut off retreat. Shall stay here as long as the Secretary desires, and join you.

Respectfully, yours,

JOHN S. CLARK,

Colonel, Aide-de-Camp.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

May 24, 1862-11.40 p. m.

Colonel JOHN S. CLARK, Relay House:

General Banks in Winchester. Came through from Strasburg without seeing the enemy. An attack by a small force was made upon baggage train at Berryville, but repulsed with little loss on either side. General Banks expects to be attacked in Winchester to-morrow. The force at Harper's Ferry is not large, General Miles having sent forward toward Winchester nearly all his men, expecting them to be replaced by others from Baltimore and Washington.

P. H. WATSON,

Assistant Secretary of War.

Numbers 8.] FLAT TOP, May 24, 1862.

Colonel ALBERT TRACY,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I am hurrying up stores with the intention of moving my whole command here straight on Wytheville, starting in the morning. Crook's section makes it seem a good time to strike. If I can start with ten day's supplies I should push ahead, and look after my communications after I have cut the railroad.

J. D. COX,

Brigadier-General.

Numbers 8.] MAY 24, 1862.

General COX:

Your Numbers 8 receive. The commanding general thinks it best that instead of marching upon Wytheville you should go direct to dublin Station and thence to New River, destroying the railroad and bridges as you proceed. Your better knowledge, however, of the country and circumstances renders it necessary that this should be a suggestion rather than an order. In case you adopt it, you can after crossing New River, open communication with Colonel Crook, and change your line of communication to the road from Gauley to Lewisburg. Colonel
