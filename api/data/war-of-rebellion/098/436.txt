Our loss was, under the circumstances, exceedingly light, our lines generally being well protected by heavy timber, and in some places by rude breast-works of logs and fence rails, hastily thrown up by the men. The troops bivouacked for the night in their present lines, and improved their breast-works.

On the morning of the 20th, at an early hour, Bvt. Major General A. Baird, with two brigades of his division, leaving the other in charge of the supply train, by which it was escorted to this place, arrived and reported, and was placed in reserve. Fearing's brigade, of Morgan's division, was relieved by a part of Carlin's division, and placed in reserve. Cogswell's brigade, of the Twentieth Corps, was also relieved from its position in my lines by a part of Carlin's division, and ordered to report to its command. During the forenoon, in compliance with instructions from the major-general commanding the wing, a heavy line of skirmishers was ordered to be advanced, but soon met with strong resistance. This being reported to me I immediately ordered Baird to make a reconnaissance with his two brigades and a battery to the front, with instructions to ascertain whether or not the enemy was still occupying his works in force. Baird felt of the enemy's lines well to the left of the main road near Cole's house, and found him still in position behind his original works. While this movement was being made Morgan on the right, in compliance with instructions, had driven the enemy's skirmishers from their works in his front of the previous day, and ascertained that the enemy had retired his left at almost right angles with his original lines. He was immediately ordered to take up a new advanced line accordingly, conforming his movements to those of the Fifteenth Corps, now having arrived and going into position on his right. This was done as promptly as the swampy nature of the ground and the resistance of the enemy would permit. Baird was withdrawn from his reconnaissance about dark and placed in reserve. In this position my troops remained without material change until the morning of the 22nd, when it was ascertained that the enemy had abandoned his position during the night previous.

At about 8 a.m. I received orders to march for Cox's Bridge, and immediately issued orders accordingly. Owing to the exceedingly miry ground on which the troops were encamped, rendered impassable to artillery and wagons by the recent rains, the trains and artillery were slow in getting into the road, and Cox's Bridge was only reached by the rear of the column by night, although the distance was but eleven miles. On the morning of the 23rd the corps moved at 6 a.m., and crossing the River at Cox's Bridge went into its present camp at this place before night, being informally reviewed as the troops marched through the city by the general-in-chief, Major-General Slocum, Schofield, and others.

The health of the troops during the campaign was remarkably good, as will be shown by the excellent report of Surg. W. C. Daniels, medical director of the corps, herewith submitted. *

The energy and endurance of the troops on this long and sometimes exceedingly arduous campaign on every occasion present to their superiors and the country the highest claims to reward.

The campaign was accomplished in sixty-three days, and by the official report of the chief commissary of the corps appended_ it will be seen that 250,000 rations of salt meat, 420,000 rations of hard bread, 400,000 rations of sugar, 483,000 rations of coffee, 400,000 rations of salt,
