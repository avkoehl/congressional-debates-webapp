Lieutenant Colonel W. H. LUDDLOW,

Agent for Exchange of Prisoners, Fort Monroe, Va.

COLONEL: I omitted to say in my letter of this date inclosing a copy of one from Surg. J. R. Smith that I did not think it necessary to send a copy that letter to Richmond with the rolls.

The package of rolls which you spoke of as having been mailed without postage stamps on it has not reached the post-office in this city.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

OFFICE COMMISSARY-GENERAL OF PRISONERS,

Washington, April 10, 1863.

Lieutenant Colonel GEORGE SANGSTER,

Commanding Camp Parole, Annapolis, Md.

COLONEL: The fourteen officers captured at Hartsville, Tenn., whose exchange is announced in General Orders, Numbers 10, and who arrived at Camp Parole on the 6th instant from Richmond, will be ordered to join their regiments without delay except such of them as may be required to conduct troops to Western camps. Hereafter whenever there are paroled prisoners of war at Camp Parole whose regiments are serving in the West and who should therefore be ordered to Camp Chase or Benton Barracks you will report the fact, giving the number for each camp and wait for instructions. I have understood unofficially that Lieutenant Eddy, aide-de-camp, has returned to duty with General Whipple. If this report be true please inform me by what authority he left Camp Parole and how you ascertained he was exchanged. A letter was addressed to him from this office soon after his arrival at the camp, sent to your care. Please say if it was received. Some of the rolls recently received from you are without of any kind.

Your name is required to authenticate them.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

W. HOFFMAN,

Colonel Third Infantry, Commissary-General of Prisoners.

P. S. -Hereafter you will furnish only tri-monthly reports of troops at the camp on the 10th, 20th and last day. These will take the place of the weekly reports which you now make.

COLONEL: Your dispatch relating to smallpox among the prisoners of war is just received. The utmost care has been taken here. I think that neglect has occurred at some point before arrival here. Some of the cases were of an aggravated character and the officers in charge ought to have been notified and reported them in Baltimore. Thirty smallpox cases were delivered from one steamer at City Point. Will you please inform me whether the prisoners alluded to in the letter of
