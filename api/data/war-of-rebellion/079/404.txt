U. S. IRON-CLAD ESSEX,

Memphis, October 22, 1864.

Major WILLIAM H. MORGAN,

Chief of Staff, &amp;c.:

DEAR MAJOR: I send an office again to ask if you have any further information regarding the position or movements of the enemy. Captain Pennock tells me that he may leave in the morning, and he desires to have the latest news. I must say it is my own opinion that the rebels have not in any degree abandoned their intention to attack Memphis. Their last known positions place them on roads radiating hence like a fan, and much nearer Memphis than to Columbus, or any other seemingly threatened point. They desire to full is into a fatal security by circulating rumors of intended movements into Western Kentucky. But I have no fear that they will deceive you into a disregard of all prudent preparations.

Yours, very truly,

ROBERT TOWNSEND,

Commander, U. S. Navy.

Come to Rome and to me for consultation, and prepared with a summary of all property from Chattanooga forward. Send back all unserviceable stock, wagons, and stores, and keep on hand only a limited supply, just what we can pick up in our wagons and haul.
