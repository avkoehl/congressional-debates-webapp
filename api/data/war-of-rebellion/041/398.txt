I earnestly entreat that we may be strengthened in our force by the return of so many conscripts, at least, as will fill up our regiments. I am certain that in New England and the West men will readily volunteer for service in Texas, if it is permitted.

Unless we are strengthened, we may have to abandon the great advantage we have gained. We shall commence our movement to the Rio Grande to- day.*

I have the honor to be, with much respect, your most obedient servant,

N. P. BANKS,

Major- General, Commanding.
