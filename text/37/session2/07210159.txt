_ The number of letters passing through the Brit-
ish post office in 1839, the last year of high post-
age, was 75,908,000; and the number in 1860 was
564,000,000. The uniform and low late of post-
ago in Great Bri tain has not only been a great
success financially, but by the concurrent testi-
mony of writers and travelers of every grade it
has conferred incalculable benefits upon the Brit-
ish people.
The following table gives the results of the
British post office in revenue, expenditures, num-
ber of letters, and amount of money sentin money
orders from 1839, the last year of high postage,
to 1860. I ask particular attention to this table,
for it shows the large and regular increase iri the
amount of correspondence, as well as the gain to
the revenue. It will be remembered that the change
in the rates of British postage in January, 1840,
was from an average of twelve cents a letter to the
one uniform rate of two cents, while the bill now
under discussion contemplates no radical or ma-
terial change whatever:

It will be seen that the net profit of the British
post office in 1859 was $9,003,728, and in 1860 it
was $8,682,825. It may be asset ted by some that
although a penny or two cents postage is a finan-
cial success in Great Britain, it might not be in
this country, having a much larger extent of ter-
ritory, and our postal expenses necessarily being
considerably greater.
The first answer I make to this plea is, that just
about one half of the gross postal revenue of Great
Britain is net profit, clearly demonstrating that a
one cent rate there is a compensating one. That,
however, is not the principal consideration.
Financially the most profitable rate is the one
that will bring the largest gross revenue to the
Department. The most casual glance at our postal
revenue for the last twenty-five years will show
that the lower the rates have been, the larger is
the postal income. During the last six years of
the highest rates of postage (six to twenty-five
cents a letter)—from 1839 to 1845—the postal
revenue amounted to $26,950,000. During the
next six years, when letter postage had been re-
duced to five and ten cents, the grass revenue was
$29,250,000; and when the last and-final reduction
was made, in 1851, to the rate of three cents for
prepaid letters, the gross income in six yeais was
$41,700,000. Letter postage now is not more than
one fifth the average charge previous to the year
1846, and yet our Post Office books show a total
revenue of §14,750,000 during the first six years
of the lowest rates in excess of the revenue for
the same period under the highest rates.
I lay down this proposition as correct, that in a
financial point of view the expenditures of our
Post Office Department have nothing to do with
the rates of postage which should be charged. In
a revenue aspect only, the rate of postage which
will produce the largest gross income is the most
profitable to the Government.
If our reason and experience teach that a given
rate will not only increase our postal receipts and
at the same time add to the postal facilities and
convenience of the people, the Government is der-
elict in duty and obnoxious to the charge of stu-
pidity if it refuse to adopt it. The argument de-
rived from the success'of the British system does
not lose its force ill its application to this country;
for our experience in the reduction of the rates of
postage, so far as *goes, teaches the same useful
lesson. The following table of statistics of the
United States Post Office, from 1839 to 1860 in-
elusive, will be found important as bearing upon
the question under discussion:

The several reductions in the rate of h-Her post-
age by laws passed in 1845, 1851, and 1855 have
been attended with the most overwhelming suc-
cess, not only in economy and gicatly extended
postal facilities to the people, but in largely in-
creased receipts to the Post Office. The amount
of correspondence passing through the PostOfii'M:
annually previous to the first reduction of postage in
1845 had remained almost entirely stationary for
*many years, the estimated numbei of letlei.s not
exceeding 40,000,000 per annum. Since that time
the letters passing through the Post Office at dif-
ferent peiiods have been as follows: in JS48,
54.000,000 letters; m 1852, 104,000,000: in 1856,
152,000,000, and in 18G0, 184,000,000. Thus we
see that our inland postal coi respondence has more
than quadrupled durmgthelnstfifteen years. ISror
has the financial effect on the revenues of the Post
Office been less satisfactory. In order to show in
the most sti iking light the t;fFect of reductions in
the rate of postage on the icv^nucs of the Post
Office, it will be necessary to see the entire revenue
over an equal period when the rates of postage
were different. I will take the last six ye"brs of
the period of high postages—Kinging from six to
twenty-five cents a letter—from 1839 to 1845; the
six years fiom 1845 to 1851, when letter postage
was five and ten cents—the first era of reduced
postage—and the following six years, ftom 1851
to 1857, when the lates wu*e a portion of the time
three and five cents, and lastly three cents. The
revenue of the Post Office in 1839 was $4,477,614.

The revenue under the medium rates (five and
ten cents) dminjr six years, as will be seen by the
above table, was $2,395,51!) more than dining the
six years of the high rale, (from six to twenty-live
cents,) and for the six years of [he low rate (three
and live cents) it was $14,744,037 more than
during the six years of high rules. Other compar-
isons can be made from the above table. Does
this show that a reduction in the rate of postage
necessarily decreases postal revenues3

I respectfully commend the above tabic of com-
parative statistics to the careful consideration of
the able, industi ions, and faithful chairman ofthe
PostOftice Committee, [Mi. Colfax,] and J tiust
he, the House, and the country will take note of
its teachings-. Why is it, with a population about
equal to our white population, that the peop!.- of
Great Britain wiite and send by mail three hun-
dredfend eighty million more letters per annum
than the people of the United States* Why is it
that the average inciease ofthe number of h-tn rs
annually in Gieat Britain is tweniy-three millions,
while in the United States it is only eight millions'?
Why is it tlmt the increase of postal rcvemu in
twenty yeais m Gieat I3i ifain is one hundied and
fifty-soven per cent., while for the same peiiocl tn
this country it has only been one hundred and tlnee
per cent.? It will be noted during thesame period
the mcreaseofpopulation inGreatBritain has been
only seven per cent., while in this country it has
been seventy per cent. It will be observed,also,
that thirty per cent, of the population of Gu-at
Butam cannot read or write, while of our white
population, in the same condition, there is l«>ss
than five per cent,, and this estimate includes all
the States.
