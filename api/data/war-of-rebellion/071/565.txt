WASHINGTON, August 1, 1864--12 m.

Major-General HUNTER,

Frederick, Md.:

If only cavalry have crossed, a pursuit with infantry would be useless. Moreover, in this extreme heat they would soon be broken down by a forced march. I am fitting out cavalry, and hope to send you several regiments to-day and to-morrow.

H. W. HALLECK,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

FREDERICK, MD., August 1, 1864--9. 15 a. m.

(Received 5. 50 p. m.)

Major-General HALLECK,

Chief of Staff:

From recent information I believe the enemy is moving his whole cavalry force toward the west, and have directed General Duffie's cavalry to join Averell, and pursue the enemy toward Hancock and Cumberland.

D. HUNTER,

Major-General.
