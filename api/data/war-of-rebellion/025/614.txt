By order of Major General Earl Van Dorn:

M. M. KIMMEL,

Major and Assistant Adjutant-General.

GRENADA, June 20, 1862.

Brigadier-General VILLEPIGUE,

Tallahatchie Bridge:

You will retain your present advanced position. Colonel Jackson has been ordered to report to you for orders.

When shall you want rations?

DANIEL RUGGLES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

RICHMOND, VA., June 20, 1862.

General BRAXTON BRAGG,

Tupelo, Miss.:

Your dispatch informing me that General Beauregard had turned over the command to you and left for Mobile on surgeon's certificate was duly received. You are assigned permanently to the command of the department, as will be more formally notified to you by the Secretary of War. You will correspond directly and receive orders and instructions from the Government in relation to your future operations.

JEFFERSON DAVIS.

GRENADA, MISS., June 20, 1862.

General BRAGG,

Tupelo, Miss.:

Shall I hold the line of the Tallahatchie? I have directed General Villepigue to remain at Tallahatchie. I shall send additional force to cover Panola. Government stores and many millions of property are involved in the protection of this line. Governor Pettus will give me minute-men and militia-some 3,000. Answer.

DANIEL RUGGLES,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.

TUPELO, MISS., June 20, 1862. (Received 5.30 p.m.)

General RUGGLES:

Not only hold line but take offensive. General Villepigue will have force enough to take Memphis; and, if he can, ought to do it. Canton is in General Lovell's department (now General Van Dorn's), who is authorized to call upon you at his discretion for troops. Defend with all available means at all hazards. Inform and confer with General Van Dorn, now en route for Jackson.

BRAXTON BRAGG.
