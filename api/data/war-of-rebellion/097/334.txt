HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS,March 31, 1865-1 p. m.

General RAWLINS:

Enemy completely checked, and Warren is now pushing his command after them. They seem to be falling away from his center, and reported going both ways. He will attack them with all his force. Prisoners from each division of Hill's corps and Bushrod Johnson's division.

O. E. BABCOCK,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Aide-de-Camp.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,March 31, 1865-12.30 a. m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Mackenzie is at W. Perkins' house, at Hatcher's Run, with pickets out to Reams' Station, also down to Great Cat-tail Creek. The Fifth Corps trains, guarded by the Eleventh and Fourteenth U. S. Infantry, are at the junction of the Vaughan and old stage roads, and in park there. Three hundred cavalry are at the junction of Quaker and Vaughan roads. To-morrow the trains will move at daylight down to the junction of the stage and Quaker roads, thence north across Gravelly Run, and be parked in the neighborhood of the meeting-house. It might be well to order up some of Mackenzie's cavalry to picket east and southeast of your camp.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.
