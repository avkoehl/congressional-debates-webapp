1st Session-.
FRIDAY, JULY 14, 1848
New Series No. 58.
the subject now because he thought the President
intended to create a false impression on the public
mind concerning the cost of the war. Let gentle-
men remember that the loan bill of $36,000^000 of
this session was for deficiencies of the last year.
The deficiencies of the present year were yet un-
known. On the whole, Mr. S. here declared that
the total sum which the people of this country
would have to pay, and lose out of the land fund
together, in his opinion, in consequence of this
war, would greatly exceed $120,000,000. But he
put it at the lowest probable sum.
Mr. VINTON reminded the gentleman that he
had omitted one very important item—the excess
of the revenue over' the ordinary current peace
expenditures of the Government.
Mr. STEPHENS replied he had not put that
into the estimate, because he took if for granted
that the party in power would spend all there was
in the treasury, notwithstanding all their profes-
sions for economy. [Laughter.]
Where was the indemnity, then, for this war?
The payment of at least $320,000,000. This was
our indemnity for the past. Why, this Adminis-
tration had gone to war for the enormous outrages
committed by Mexico, and for the debt of $5,000,000
due from that Republic to our citizens, and, after
expending $120,000,000, had got a territory which
was not claimed to be worth more than $30,000,000
before the war, and we ourselves were to pay this
$5,000,000 to our citizens!
Mr. SCHENCK said, that growing out of this
war, the Treasury Department had made a call for
additional clerks, whose salaries alone amounted
to as much as would pay a regiment of a thousand
men—to $84,000.
Mr, STEPHENS continued. Well, in addi-
tion to this indemnity for the past in a barren coun-
try, which we should have to pay some four times
as much for as it was worth before the war, what
was the security for the future of which the Presi-
dent spoke? The glory of our arms. He (Mr.
S.) told the Administration and the country that
the President laid claim to that which did not be-
long to him. These glories could never be snatched
from the brows of those gallant officers and men
who had won them. These laurels appertained to
those brave men who had gone to war in their
country's cause—they could never be wrested
from them by the Administration. There were
glories which belonged to this war, and there were
certain inglorious deeds, too, of the Administration
.connected with it. There was the glory of involv-
ing his country in an unconstitutional and unne-
cessary war—a glory which rested on the brow of
'the President. The glory of equivocating to the
country as to the objects of the war; the glory of
entering into an odious if not a treacherous intrigue
with Santa Anna, by which he was restored to
lead his countrymen to fight against our gallant
army; the glory of not only withholding troops
from General Taylor, but of stripping him of his
gallant men, of leaving him exposed to the over-
whelming numbers of Santa Anna's army; the
glory of attempting to supplant the same gallant
general with a lieutenant general—these laurels
encircled the President's illustrious brow J The
glory also of having ordered Mr. Marcy to write
that ignominious letter to General Taylor, charging
him with giving valuable information to the enemy,
and threatening him with dismissal, when he had
borne aloft so gallan tly our Hag at Palo A1 to, Resaca
de la Palma, and Monterey, and in whose hands
the flag of his country had never been soiled; the
glory of having sent General Pillow to Mexico to
write his own praise; the glory of having brought
home the gallant Scott, after his brilliant victories
there, to be dishonored and disgraced in his own
country,—these were a part of the glories which
encircled the President's brow! But the war glo-
ries of a different sort which had been won by our
officers and soldiers; by the gallant Twiggs, Shields,
Smith, Worth, duitman, Davis, Wool, and many
others; by the brave and lamented Hardin, McKee,
Clay, and Yell; by the gallant dead as well as by
the gallant, living; by the illustrious Scott and
Taylor; these were glories which the Administra-
58
tion had no power to wrest from the brows of
those who had so nobly won them.
But in that message the President intimated that
soon after the last war the Government had gone
into enormous extravagancies, into wasteful ap-
propriations of money for a general system of in-
ternal improvements, and that General Jackson had
arrested it. Now, he intended to nail that charge
to the counter, as one of the specimens of this spu-
rious coin which the President attempted to palm
off upon a credulous and confiding country. He
had intended to have done it at an early period of
the session, but he had not then had the opportu-
nity to contradict that statement. We had pub-
lished, in a Senate document (No. 44) of the last ;
session of the last Congress, the amount of appro-
priations made by the General Government for
internal improvements since 1806. He had an ab-
stract of this document before him, and he would
read it, and let the country see how far it was that
Mr. Monroe and Mr. Adams had gone into a
gigantic system of internal improvements, which
it had been reserved for General Jackson to arrest.
Here (said Mr, S.) is the recapitulation of the
amount expended in each four years from 1806 for
internal improvements, taken from Senate Doc. 2d

The President also intimated in his message
now upon the table, that a standing army was dan-
gcrous to the liberties of the people. He would
have the country perhaps believe, that he there
recommended a reduction of the army to its num-
ber before the war. Now this he (Mr. S.) be-
lieved was a deliberate attempt to create a false
impression upon the countiy. The President had
told us, in his message, that—
l'The old army, it existed before the commencement of
the war wilh Mexico, especially if a nhority be given to fi!l
up the rank and file of the se\oral corps to the maximum
number authorized during the v\ dr. it is believed will be a
sufficient force to be retained in s-emee dut in? a period of
peace. A few additional officers m the line and staff of the
army have been authorized, and tliest-, it is believed, will he
necessary m the peace establishment, and should be retained
in the service. The number of the general officers may be
reduced, as vacancies occur by the casualties of the service,
to what it was before the war.
" While the people of othei countries, who live under
form? of Government !es^ free ihan oui own. have been for
a^es oppressed by tavation to suppoit I.uge standing anni-'s
in periods of peace, our experi.-iice ha* t-lum n that .-ucli
establishments a e unnecessary in a republic Our standing
armv is to be found in the bosom of society. It is composed
of free citizens, who are ever ready to take up aims n  the
service of their country when an emergency icquircs it.
Our experience in the war ju^f closed fully confirms the
opinion that such an atmvmav be raised upon a few weeks*
notice, and that our citizen-soldiers are equal to any troops
m the world. No reason, therefore, is perceived whv we
should enlarge our land forces, and therebv subject the
Treasury to an annual increased chaia^. Sound policy re-
quites that we should avoid the creation of a large standing
army in a period of peace. No public exigency requires
it. Such armies are not only expensive and unnecessary,
but may become dangeious to hbeity."
Now, who can doubt that it was sought to make
the honest people of the country suppose that this
was a recommendation to Congress to go back to
the peace establishment as it existed before the
war? No such thing. The bill of the 13th May,
1846, empowered the President to double the army;
and if the army were to remain as the President
here clearly intimates as proper, and said might
safely be done, it would be 17,256 men in the rank
and file of the army, instead of 8,616, as it existed
before this war. If the intimation of the President,
or covert recommendation, should be carried out,
our standing army would be doubled.
Mr. McCLERNAND obtained the floor, and
said he had risen, without previous preparation, to
make such reply as he might, from his general
knowledge of the facts and circumstances, to the
extraordinary speech which had just been deliver-
ed—wilh much eloquence and ability, he confessed
—by the gentleman from Georgia, [Mr. Ste-
phens.] He had had some experience in this
body; he had been here several years, and he must
confess the spectacle exhibited this morning was
the most extiaordinary of any which had ever
come to his knowledge within the walls of this
chambcr. What were the facts? A few days ago
this House had received a message from the Presi-
dent of the United States communicating the treaty
which terminated the war with Mexico, and, in-
stead of gentlemen on the other side of the House
meeting the question and the facts presented in
that message, they were found now sedulously,
ingeniously devising means to avoid the responsi-
bility of meeting this question and the facts—he
might say, by resorting to a subterfuge. The
President informed us in his message that the war
had terminated; that by the treaty terminating the
war we had acquired New Mexico and California.
What was the extent of these countries? We
found that California stretched upon the Pacific
coast something like one thousand miles; that it
extended back upon the continent some six or
seven hundred miles; that California comprised
within its limits the great Pacific harbor of the
world—a harbor of sufficient capacity to receive
all the navies of the world. We found that by
the acquisition of California we had obtained the
mastery of the Pacific—the control of that great
ocean which opened out upon the East Indies and
China, which country we, might reach in thirty
days with the aid of steam power; and that inex-
haustible markets had been opened for the products
of our country. We found that this vast acquisi-
tion had been made by this war, and consummated
by this treaty. Not only had we acquired Cali-
fornia, but New Mexico, a part of which country
bordering upon the Rio Grande contained excel-
lent lands, capable of producing such grain? as
were grown in this country, and vines from which
were manufactured the finest wines—wines high
in estimation in Mexico andjin the United States.
The President told us that all this had been ac-
quired by this war; and now what did he propose?
He asked Congress to take measures to consum-
mate these acquisitions, to render them effectual;
and Democrats on this floor were prepared to do
so. But what was the position taken by the Op-
position? Did they come forward to meet the
question, and to disparage the value of these acqui-
sitions? No: but to revamp an old question, to
renew an old issue, and thus avoid meeting the
•subject The Whig members of the House came
forward, not directly to resist the consummation
of the measures recommended* by the President,
but to make an old issue a new one—to bring up
again the Question of the boundary of Texas the
question of the power of the President.of the Um-
1 ted States, under the Constitution, to establish
■ military governments in New Mcxico and Califor-
nia; and thus, by indirection and evasion, they
I sought to shirk from their position of opposition
' to the war, and of underestimating the value ot
the acquisition of the extensive territories which
became ours under the treaty. The country would
