Brigadier General W. L. ELLIOTT,

Chief of Cavalry:

I have just taken 13 prisoners from the rear of enemy's rear guard on Marietta road. A small detachment from my command are pushing and annoying them. I did not feel at liberty to detach any large force, as I was ordered to cover these roads, and moving in that direction would uncover them. These prisoners represent the following regiments, all of infantry: Fifty-eighth North Carolina, Thirty-sixth Georgia, Fifty-fourth Virginia, all of Stevenson's division, Hood's corps, Reynold's and Cumming's brigades. I don't' think they want to fight this side of the Chattahoochee.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

E. M. McCOOK,

Colonel, Commanding.

P. S.-Can't I order my men back from the Cartersville road, near Burnt Hickory? I learn Stoneman is near there.
