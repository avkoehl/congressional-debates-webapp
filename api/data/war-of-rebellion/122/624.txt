We can raise a regiment in Franklin County quickly if a camp is allowed at Chambersburg. The sheds, stores, and other property used in spring are there. General McCalla [McAllen] will command the regiment. Will you authorize it? Telegraph me and the quartermaster and commissary here.

SAINT PAUL, MINN., November 8, 1861.

Honorable SIMON CAMERON,

Secretary of War:

The two Minnesota batteries are organized; also the second and third companies of cavalry. There are no uniforms or equipments here for them. Will the Government furnish them here, or order the companies to a place where they can be supplied? Third Regiment of Infantry will leave for Louisville, Ky., about the 12th instant. Will have no arms or accouterments. If they have not already been sent here, those of Third Regiment should be sent to Louisville, and for the Fourth sent here at once. Answer immediately.
