THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
April 22,
we never received a cent of postage, we should be
fully compensated, m this way, for the money we
have paid, by the increased knowledge we have
received with regard to the building of ocean steam-
ers. Collins & Co. have, at an immense expense
of time and money, rendered all these services
to the country, and we have reaped all the advan-
tage of their enterprise. They have sustained all
the loss. I say, theiefore, that these consider-
ations ought to enter imo the minds of Senators
when they vote on this proposition.
Again: the building of them and running of
these ships have produced to the country a class of
practical engineers that it would not have had
without that undertaking. It has been a school
for our young engineers. These vessels are now
every year training up engineers, who are to take
charge of our steam-ships of war, to be employed
in the commercial marine. Thus the country is
acquiring knowledge at the expense of the owners
of the Collins line. This, also, ought to be taken
into consideration. So great has been the skill,
and so perfect the skill, in the construction of these
ships and of their machinery, that no accident, of
any moment, has happened to them.
Mr. HALE. The Atlantic broke her shaft.
Mr. MILLER. True; but it was one which
was made in England!
In advocating the policy of our Government
sustaining these steamers, I wish to call the atten-
tion of the Senate and the country to what Great
Britain is doing upon this subject of ocean mail
steamers, not only with regard to the Cunard line,
but in regard to many other lines. She has es-
tablished five great routes of ocean mail steamers.
I do not speak now of her inland steam postal ar-
rangements. She has now under contract with
the Admiralty, sixty-three ocean mail steamers,
every one of which may be converted into war
steamers. The aggregate power of these steamers
is twenty-nine thousand six hundred and twenty
horse power—their tonnage is sixty-one thousand
three hundred and forty eight—they annually
steam one million five hundred and seventy-tive
thousand miles. These routes are, in the first
place, the Atlantic route, from Liverpool to New
York. The second is the route to the West In-
dies and the eastern coast of South America. That
route has its depot at St. Thomas, from which
they branch out with about twenty steamers, to
the various West India Islands—to the coast of
South America, and to Mexico. I have prepared
a statement of the different minor routes connected
with this line, showing their destination, the
amount of tonnage, and the number of miies they
steam. Then there is the great East India line,
which sails twice a month from Southampton, in
England, touching at Gibraltar, and then to Alex-
andria, thence taking the overland route for a
short distance, take steam again at Suez to Cal-
cutta, and Bombay, and China. Then there is
also the route by way of the Cape of Good Hope;
also, the Pacific route from "Valparaiso to Pana-
ma. There are several other proposed routes, and
which I understand have been contracted for, to
Australia and other portions of the East. I have
prepared tabular statements of these different
routes, showing the number of steamers, ton-
nage, power, and the miles steamed.

I will also read to the Senate a description of
this great Oriental route. Its extent and magni- j
tude are astonishing: j
"At S^uez, at the head of the Red Sea, two steamers are !
in waiting toi the passengers and maiN conveyed from '
Alexandria m small steamer up the Nile, and in vans across I
the deceit. One of the steamers at Suez belongs to the !
East India Company, and has Bomh.ij foi its destination; '
the other is the property of the Oriental Company. The
tenth ot the month ^ fixed as the da} ol departure; and all j
per-on- and things having been shipped, the vessels steam 1
down the Red Sea to Aden, distant Horn Suez 1,3U8 miles, i
Here they pait company; the Oneiual steamer pursues a j
course almost due ea-t, across the Indian ocean, to Point '
de Gnllc, in the {-land of Cevlon, a distance of 2 J34 miles, j
Haumi exchanged mails with the vessel for China, she !
st. aiih up the Coiomandel coa«t to Madras, and on to C.tl- i
cnua, whete she ai rives in .tboui twenty-eight days from '
Suez, alter traversing 4,757 miles, and spending in stoppages ;
about five days
" The vessel m waiting at Point de Galle, as soon as, she I
receives what the other h as brought her starts eastward, and
after traversing 1,286 miles, arrives at Penan?, in the pen-
insula of Malacca; from thence, steaming down between
Sumatra and the mainland,she arrives at the little Island of
Singapore, almost under the line, and then up the Chinese
sea, teruble for its typhoons, to Hong Kong, where the lit-
tle steamer in No. 5 is ready to continue the line of com-
munication to Canton.
"The number of miles steamed by the vessels of this
company, under contiact, is 381,9G0, and the payment
£204,500 per annum. The company makes an annual
dividend of eight per cent- on a capital of about £ 1 ,(100,000;
and supposing that the same fleet was kept up, and the rev-
enue reduccd to that derived hom passengers and mexchan-
dise alone, not only could no dividend be paid, but an actual
loss sustained every year of more than £12i),00)—another
striking illustration oj a fact already adverted £o, that,
without a post office contract such schemes of tegular and
efficient ocean steam navigation couldnot bemamtained."*
This shows that, although the proprietors of
this Oriental line now divide eight per cent, divi-
dend per annum, yet if the contract under which
they carry the mails were taken away, it could
not be sustained, but that there would be a loss of
<£126,000 per annum.
There is nodoubt aboutit, that that is the policy
of England. She looks to the great return, to her
commerce and to her manufactures, and, as this
writer states, if not a cent of money is added to
her revenue, by means of her postal contracts, yet
she would be the gainer by establishing and keep-
ing up these immense lines of steam navigation.
These sixty-three ocean steamers, with a tonnage
of 65,348, steaming 1,575,000 miles per annum,
are under the control of the Admiralty, and are
capable of being converted, at any time, into war
steamers. Now, Senators, look at the policy of
England. By her lines of steamers she has sur-
rounded the world. We all remember that striking
simile of England's power, " that the roll of her
drum is heard from the rising to the setting of the
sun." That figure will be changed. War will
give way to peace, and the merry ring of the
ocean steamer s bell will be heard, bell sounding
to bell, the world round.
With these facts before us—with this mighty
demonstration made and making by the English
Government for the commerce of the world—are
we to stand still and to doubt about keeping up
the most important line of war steamers that
we have afloat? No, sir. While gentlemen
alarm themselves about him whom they call the
Bear of Russia, and are terrified lest he may
march an army across Asia—" dragging its slow
length along," with all its cumbersome and costly
appendages—and thereby control the destinies of
the world !—yes, sir, while we are dreaming of
transcendental ideas about the trodden down na-
tions of Europe, England is plowing the oceans
from pole to pole with her mighty fleet of steam-
eis, and sowing the seeds of a commerce and of
trade from which she will hereafter reap a harvest
such as no nation on this earth ever garnered be-
fore. That is her policy. It should be ours. It
is our mission. It is the mission of commerce to
civilize the world. Itis commerce, aided by steam,
that is to carry those principles of liberty and en-
terprise which have given to this country itsprom-
inence and its glory throughout the world to the
other races and nations of mankind. I am for
sustaining this policy. I am for keeping up these
lines. I am for increasing them. And as soon
as a communication is opened between the Atlan-
tic and the Pacific—as soon as the dream of the
old Spaniard shall be fully realized, when the
two oceans shall unite—lam for continuing these
great lines of steam commercial navigation across
the Pacific, and to meet England there with her
great line which passes from Southampton to
Alexandria, to the Indian seas, and to China.
Then the two great nations of the world—of one
blood, descending from the same great stock—
will, by means of the enterprise of their citizens,
protected and defended by their Governments,
carry commerce and civilization round the world.
-"The Indian mail which left Southampton in August
last filled 157 chests, eac-h capable ot holding 10,000 letters,
and at Malta 120 smailei cheats were, added that had been
brought through Fiance. Making allowance for the news-
papers contained m these, the number of letters must still
have bcrn enormous. Ail this wilting and tiansmi^sion of
intelligence necessarily increase trade, and consequently
bring additional supplies of articles to this country, the
duties on which must more than makeup the diffeience
between the payments to the companies and the revenues
ot the po<t office. But on higher considerations than (hose
of mere profit and loss, we have no hesitation in saying that
the blcs mgs to the couutiy of these lines ot speedy com-
munication would not be purchased dearly if not one
fartlnng of the contract money were returned."
