or Taylor's armies will not be disturbed as long as they behave themselves, but you will put down guerrillas and jayhawkers with a strong hand. You will keep the telegraph open as far north as the Tallahatchee River, and the force at La Grange will keep it open to that point. You will take 100 rounds of ammunition. Report daily as soon as the telegraph is in operation.

COLONEL: I send you some of President Johnson's proclamations,* which you will have distributed in the country; and you will take all proper steps to intercept Jeff. should he attempt to escape by passing anywhere in that region. The various rewards that will be offered for him will probably reach a very large sum, and you will use every persuasion to induce the disgusted secesh to join in hunting him.

You will leave 100 men at Senatobia, and with the rest of your command return to La Fayette. Leave a good officer at Senatobia.
