boundless prosperity—in 1870 the total produc-
tion of manufactures alone was $4,112,453,616,
an increase in that decade of war and devasta-
tion of one hundred and twenty-eight per cent.
over the combined production of 1860. This

as heretofore. In 1860 the products of the mines and fisheries amounted to about ninety million dollars.
t About.
Increaso of 1870 over 1860, one hundred and twenty-
Now, let us face these facts. Here is one
side of the proposition furnished by the Cen-
sus Bureau; the gentlemen on the other side
prove the other. They say we do not export
our productions as largely as we did ten years
ago. Then, what becomes of them? Where
do they go? Why, sir, American laborers,
enfranchised freedmen, our better-paid me-
chanics, consume a larger proportion of the
four thousand and odd millions produced in
1870 than they were able to consume of the
one thousand and odd millions produced in
1860. That is the whole of it. You, free-
trade revenue reformers, state one side of the
sum, and I hand you from the census tables the
other; and the great public will work out the
result and find it to be as I have stated it.
Gentlemen talk about restoring things to the
ante-bellum condition, to what it was iu 1860
or 18G1, and tell us what the duties were then.
National assessors, collectors, and detectives
were then unknown. Which of them orcau all
of them with their united power turnthehands
of time and the progressive tide of civilization
back and restore the condition of things in
1801 ? Can they make the American labor-
ers take fifty per cent, of their present wages
without strikes and lock-outs that shall suspend
fill our industries? Can they make the freed-
man work without wages, dwell in unfurnished
huts, and wear the coarse stogies made of horse
hide that they and their wives then wore? No,
sir; and I accept that class of shoes as illus-
trative of the general argument. They are
no longer made in the shops of New England ;
they are things of the past. Those who pro-
duced them now make lasting and calf-skin
boots and shoes on the same large lasls on
which they used to make the coarse stogies.
The slave of 1860 is to-day a planter or a man
who earns wages, and whose family consumes
dutiable and taxable commodities. By spend-
ing his wages for the comforts of life he stim-
ulates the general industry of the country.
Hosts of our workingmen now dwell in their
own homes. Would that the gentleman from
Illinois, [Mr. McNeely,] who spoke yester-
day of their hopeless condition and the squalor
in which they dwell, would spend a week with
me in my homo and look from my windows
upon the clean brick houses, with little gardens
in the front and rear, with parlors well fur-
nished, and many of them with a piano or
melodeon, or other musical instrument ; with
their rooms lighted by gas and heated by pat-
ented processes; with bath-rooms supplied
with hot and cold water flowing every miuute
in the year. These, sir, are the houses in
which our workingmen dwell, and thousands
of which they own; many of them are under
the shadow of the public school-house and the},
church, to the support of which the occupants
freely and liberally contribute. A visit to a
few hundred such homes would change many
of the gentleman's opinions, and convince even
him that protection is the right of the laborer
and a boon to the consumer. Yes, sir, our
prosperous people are the consumers of the
four thousand and odd millions of our produc-
tions. They make such demands upon our
industries that their productions cannot he
spared to go abroad in competition with those
of the cheap labor of France, Belgium, and
other countries in which laborers are esteemed
as of lower value than cattle.
But, sir, notwithstanding all that is said to
the contrary, our exports have increased and
are increasing, but not in proportion t.0 our
productions. I have before me a table from
the Bureau of Statistics, showing the imports
and exports for the seven months ending Jan-
uary 31, 1871, and the seven months ending
January 31, 1872. Our imports of free goods
increased in the latter period $4,900,000; of
dutiable goods, $54,080,000. But let me invite
the attention of gentlemen to the official state-
ment. It is as iollows :

Sir, in view of facts like these, who will say
that ours is a prohibitory tariff? Who will so
characterize a tariff' under which we have iu
seven months made an increase of imports
of $58,980,651? What a commentary i3
this upon the honesty of the cry of " prohib-
itory duties," which is ever coming from the
free-trade revenue reformers ?
Mr. BUKCHAPJ). It is prohibitory ou
some articles, not generally.
Mr. KELLEY. It thus appears that we
have reexported of iree goods $1,848,000^ in
cxcess of the seven months of the preceding
year, and of dutiable, $275,738, making a
total increase of reexports of $2,134,000 ; and
that the balance of domestic exports, exclu-
sive of specie, in excess of the seven months
of last year, is $11,012,400. Our exports are
growing ill spile of the inordinate increase
of the home demand for our varied pro-
ductions.
Sir, let us hastily consider the bills before
us, and ascertain who are the free-traders and
who want Japanese isolation. The majority

"Coin and bullion included in total domestic
exports.
