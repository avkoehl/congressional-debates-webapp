income ui %5 000, would wet $7 000 m the appropuation , and
the one who had the income ot $5000 would lose ©2 000 m the
division of the joint income Ant this (Mi P said) would be
nothing mine not less than swindling and plundei, under covei

Mi P continued Ihe gentleman [Mi GtbiiiNGj had ju^t

him who proposed the system, it waa a matte i oi peifect m

and no authority could induce him to adopt it, or sanction it by

Jai tndenh ted too great a combination, to be checked by ap
peals of tli it kmd lie said you might as well attempt to bind
down i b long man with cobwebs, as to arrest the coui°e of
i venta on thede appiopnations But there was a measure with
which he was somewhat identified, which ought to have some
influence upon gentlemen in the < ourse they were to puisne
ildallu'edt the busp„nsiou of the fouuh instalment under
die late deposite law which would become due on the first of

fmrth instilment amounted to $9300000, and would he depo-
sited with th" State*, foi their use under the late law, on the 1st
of lanu-uy, 1839 He contended that it was the interest of most
membf'rstohu bind the resouices of the Government, so as
in meet th*e instalment Hete was a bill now pioposmg to dis
tubutc $4*59 000, m equal proportions to Ohio, fndiani, and
Illinois I hey might go font But where was the intei est of
Pennsylvania, New York, Massachusetts, Virginia, and Noith
( uolina? If they would unite in ¡suspendirg those appioptia

tended to lyeir with mt anj mnetiil mjuiy except peihaps
to a few in h\i Ini s And so might the Haibor bill, the Tortifi

of the Iienury, and the embairassed condition of things m
many-cecums the> ought tobe suspended for the pieseut, and
even gentlemen who suppoited them might, with great pro
ptiety, vote foi sucha couise under present encumstances
He w trued ^eiitlemen who were ldentifi* d with the lor
f mes ot the present Administration to beware how they voted
luge appiopnations Then opponents would, m many m
stinces, eagerly go for heavy appropriations, even if it left the
Tiea^ury perfectly destitute-, and then they would denounce you
for your imbecility, an i treat yon with contempt for the very
embarrassments they had aided to bring upon you Mr P said
the true strength of the Adrmnistiation, at piesent, was in real
if for v in I it tn nchment, and their veiknesb wasm heavy dis

necessary I et them make no calls íor new 1 reasury notes-
bring the expenditmes within the income TTpon this point
Mi P said he wasgUdto heai the chauuianof the Committee
of Ways and Means explim that he did not intend to ask for any
more Pieasury notes than were authorized by the law of Octo
her last rhn he only desired to reissue those which had been
lecpivd into the Treasury Tor instance, $4,000000 had been
received He desired to give authority to leissue those, if ne
cessary, and, m the i mtmgency that the other $b,000 000 should
he receivedin the year, to reissue them, if theie were no other
funds in the Treasuiy
Mr F did not exacrly understand the second bill on that sub
ie r, but he declared he would not vote for any other Treasury
inrp bid it was not needed, if tins House would only suspend
s > ne or the unnecessary apptopriattons He said be had not
v i ed I >r the l reasurv note bill passed list session, and did not
Ikp ever to vote for any of them lie had no particular objec
tion to cai ry out the intention of Congress in the a< t passed at
th11 Uia session, and to allow the reissuing of what had been
je eived so as, in part, to allow the Treasury to anticipate its
lfvcnnes foi the year 183Sto the amount of $10,000 000 bu no
moro líe was induced to allow this, because Congress rnd ex
ten le 1 indulgence on the custom house bonds, and the lev^nue
from that quartet would not fullv begin tocóme in until the two
last quarters ol the piesent year, it was nothing but right that
we «should provi le other means for the present, he somewhat
prewired an old fashioned loan, but it was a matter of no great
( on&equence He would tell gentlemen there was nothing more
unpopular in the South than too many Treasury note bills If
the appropr ations went m uch over ^¿3 000 000m reality íor this
year im lading the ^6 000,000 for the Honda war,there would
oe confusión, and embarrassment, and weakness He calle)
$pon gentlemen whose hearts were devoted to the support of
his A Irmnistiation to pau e in this matter, ind uriite io with
holding expenditmes at least for iyear, if they wished to sti3
lain fhems Ives Bcfoie he took his seat, Mr P said, he would
make a motion to lay the bill on the table, with a view to p >st
pone it until next session He thought some might vote forthte
course with that view, who mistht sustain the appropriation, if
the finances wete in such a state is ro authonze it at piesent
But taking eveiy thing Into con«ideratior, this was oncof thObC
worvs which might beai a suspension for one year Hf then
mide the motion but said, as he had extended his íemarks
much further than he had any idea of doing when he lose, he
would withdraw his motion, if any gentleman would iequect it
who debire I to leply to him, ptovitled ho would rer ew the
motion
REMARKS OF MR   CORWIN, OP OHIO,
ON THE SAME SUBJECT
Mj CORVI I\ addressed the House as follows—
Mi s,PEAKí:ii I peiceive the Houtse is unusiuily imp uient
of this debate I am very reluc ant, at any timp, to hit up m^
voice ¡n lhis Babel of confuted voices, but especially so now,
noi would 1 delav the final voLe foi a moment did I not re
mf mbpr thatthi^ bill has been already once rejected, but a ddj
oi two since and from the tone of discussion this morning 1
have too much reason to fear it will meet asimilar fate by
the \ >te now about to be taken I may add, al^o, that I (eel
unwilling to peimit the íemarks of the two gentlemen from
South Camlira[Mr Olüwney and Mr Pickens] to pass to the
press and horn thence into the public mind, without an attempt,
atleist, to correct he eironeous impressions in which) accoid
jug t« my vietVi,, they abound
Ihe billnow undei ditocu^sion, for the continuation of the
Cumberlmd roid, is nothing moie nor less than the conimu
anee of a system of legular annua! expenditure, be°un in
ISOb, and coiitmued, with the exception oí the shoit penodof
the wai with Gieat BntaJn, ei.ery year up to the present time
The estimates (oi this appropuation are asregularly and habí
tually sent in by the fieasuiy DepaitmenCas are those foi
the salai y of the President and othei public servants, or those
foi the suppoit of theaim> If a continued persevei^nce m
the piosecution oí any public me^me for thnty yeats cannot
be looked to as «etthns the public utility of such measure oi
the fixed policy and duty of this Government, beyond the
reach of cavil oi objection then indeed may u be truly paid that
we are a people without common forethought, a Government
without any established policy, a Confederacy without any
common end oi aim whitevei
Ihe construction of the road provided form this hiU, fiom
the wateisol the Atlantic to the Mississippi nvei, wason#iruted
during the Administration oi Mr Jefieison It has received
the countenance of every shade ind complexion of political
party in Congress,, at various periods since, and has been sane
tioned by the approval of every executive from that ume to
the present It has thus  become mcorpoiated with your policy
It makes a part of the creed of all parties, and, as it ad v ant es
in its progress, is woven into the textuie of those systems' of in
teroa) improvement going forward in each of tlte six Mates
thiough which it passes "a measure thus perseveimsdy con
titiiieu so long sustaining itself, thiough perpetual conflicts,
and eveiy vici"bHU(lp ol out hi tory foi the last thirty vens,
comes recommend? I at once to the mind is something i eecs
sary something which has been four d indispensable and not
meiely convenient It stands in your policy like one ol those
ti u hs in philos >phy which is not questioned, because H has re
ccived the geneial absent of all reasonable men Speaking oí
such a measuie this mouiins, the eentleman from ¡south Caro
¡in i (Mt Pickens nchly imbued as his mmd is with phdoiogi
cal learning ) could find no tei ms whereby to characteuze this
bill less odious than szomdhng ar d, lunder Then, by a dcx
nous evatsion of the substance, and a strict observance of the
lettei of the rule of com te-*y m debate, the gentleman has been
able by fair infeience, to denounce the supporters of the bill
a-, the piomp ersof ' swindling ' the aiders and abettors of
"plundei " [Here Mr Pickets rose and observed that he had
not applied the teims stated by Mr C to the bill, or thOBe who
supported it He had stated, m argument, the case ofa general
«aysiem of taxation, and an appropriation to partial andltcal
purposes, and denominated that as swindling and plun le j
Mr C piocee led I understand the gentleman as he explains
himself He h is made a speech against this bilí He has en
deavored to illustrate, m various ways, us inequity and im
policy He denounces this road as local m its character, and
not oí geneiat utiluy He shows that the money appro!mated
is i pau ot the common revenue iaised irom the whole TJaion
He then bpeaks ot g neial taxation, and local appropriations,
an! calls this last a system of swindling and plunder It is
but the differenceb tween a positive as&eition anda conclusion
fiom premises stated "mi, I desire, when thus arraigned) to
submit my defence If I am not mistaken the gentleman will
find this & y? fern, and this ? oorf, have been cherished, and
htai ily supported by men, living and dead, to whom even lie
would be willing to defer in such matteis and with whose me
mones and charactet he would not associate the folly and
criminality which, in his over \\iought real, he fancies he has
discoverc I m this bill
Mi Speakei, I do not intend to elaboiate an essiy upon this
road, but I must be peimitted to notice foi a few moments the
very summary method by which gentlemen with great appa
rent ease acquit their c  nsciences of all censure for "votug-
down now and for ever all fuither appropriations of the kind
Yesterday the gentlem m fiom South Carolina [Mr Rhett]
spoke of the ¡supposed importance of the road we&t of Wheeling
for military purpose^, as an idea too ndiculous to menta
moment s serioui. tnought It seemed to him perfectly idle to
imagine that oidnauce or military stoie  would ever be tran-~-
poitedby land westwmd while the Ohio river remained, and
so, with undoubtmg a nfidence and the utmo t selfcompla
cency, he assures us that a "fool's cap and bells" shO'tld be
bestowed upon my one who entertains a contrary oomion
Sir, I hope I may be allowed, with great humility, not indeed
to deny to the conclusions of the gi ntleman the greatest cer
tamty possible m matteis of thib kind, I ut merely to surest a
fact or two which it may be well to c«n&ider a moment befoie
we swear to the infallibility of his judgment on this military
question Inthefir*t place, the mad and i iver, th uah both
running from east to west, fiom Wheeling to the Mississippi,
are distant from each other, from north to south, from 90 to
l§0 miles at various points I think it possible m the ch uices
ojf war thai it might become necessaiy to march a military
force directly from Wheeling to Columbus, m Ohio, or to the
cap tal  of Indiana or Illinois, and to take along with such force
a uain of artillery Would the Ohio river, think you, be so
(billing as to leave Us .anient bed, and beat your car non Oft
it« waves actus  die count i y from Wheeling to Cohimbus, in
Ohio, and irom thence bj Indianapolis to Spnngfield, in
Ihmois 1 If wc could suspend the laws of the phy&cal woifd,
oi if a miracle could be wrought at our coramaod, then the
confident opm on of the g ntleman, that this road l^ m no
sense, of military importance, would, m my poor judgment,
appeal some whit plausib'e But the gentleman seems also
to forget that the waters oí the Ohio, in spite of our wishes to
the contrary, will Ireeze into hard ice For three mouths in
the v.inter it is not at all tunes navigable On account of
«.hoi's it is, not navigable at ? tunc of 1 >w water m the summer/
And hence it would iwllow, that your military movementsm"
th-tt quarter, if evei neces aiy, would have to wait for the floods
of summer and tl e thaws oí winter Cut 1 will not venture to
oppose anj speculative notions oí mine to an opinion so con
fidently enteit lined byse\enl gentlemen fiom the South who
hive spol en i ihi debate I wih fouifv mj^elf by an atitho
nty winch I am «u e v\jl| comm md, is I know it should, mfi
nitely moie íe^aid ¡hm any 0} mionoi argument of mine
It will bo remembered, Mi Speaker, that this Government,
<=oon after the Í lie war with Gieat Britain, admonished by the
expenence of that wai, detei mined oi prusectumg a general
system of military defence Io this end, Creneral Bernard,
was bi ought trom Prance and placed at the head of the Engl
neei coips In the year 1324, it bee me the du y of this officer,
undtr the direction of Mr Toí n C Calhoun, then Secretary of
War, to survey and repon to Congress *ueh rivers to be im
proved, and canals and roads to be c~>nsuucied all oter our
teintoiy, as weie concei/ed io be of national importance lor
commeiciat oi mih ai> pu po^e^ On ilie3d of December,
lu34 Mr Column submitted to the P e dent, and through him
t  f jn_rebS the íe^ult of tl e labors, of tina corps, accompa
n ed with his own reflection  ai d recommc idatmns It will Lp
found on examining that document, that tins very Cumberland
road is classed with o heT great works of internal improvement,
which, m the opinion of Mi Calhoun, weie necessary to the
defence of the c mntry in war, and th it the road now under the
con ideiation of the House is there pionounced to he of " na
tional impoitance " This was the opinion of Mr Caihoun m
1824 The constiuction of the Cumbeiiand road, as a work of
commeiciai importance, as well as a sure means of binding in
umoi the Eastei n and Western portion^ of oui country, had
been urged upon Congress by Mr Gallatin, as Secretary of the
Treasury, as eaily as 1303, and by Mr Giles and Mr John
Randolph, of Virginia, in reports which they respectively sub
mitted to Congress about the same time Before the navigation
of the rivers of the West by sieam, no one could cast his eye
upon the map of the Western States^ and not perceived once
the incalculable vilue of ¡his road to ihe commerce pf hotft
Kasf and West If the application of sfeam to navigation has
diminished the impoitance of the road, thid was known and
convídete 1 by Mi Calh mn, when he made ihe tepoit to which
I have leleued In 1S24 the s tamboats weie flying on their
wings of file from Pittsburg to r\ew Orleans, as they are now
jet Mi talhmn pionounced the Cumberland road then a
v oik o£ nati u I impoitance ' I bee; the gentleman from
Seuth Carolina who spoke this motmng [Mr Pickfhs] to pe
luse that íeport ofhisfnend, Mr Calhoun í beg him to pon-
der well the magnificent and expensive works of internal im
piovement there commended to the favorable íeeard of this
Government The waters o* the Chesapeake and Ohio weie
to ñ jw together Prom the Ohio the chain wasiohe stretched
icios? that State to the Northern lakes, and thus the North and
S turn are to be bound up together, one in their internal inte
rest*, as they are one and identical m their national and extra
terutorial lelauons But I need notpaiticulanze, whatlhaye
specified compieheiids not the twentieth part of tíiose works m
magnitude and expense then recommended by Mr Calhoun as
piopei to be constructed by the Federal Government, at the
expense of the common Treasuiy of the nation
The Cumberland load, as I have said is one amongst the
rest there recommended a  of 'national importance " Mr
Speakei, I must beg the indulgence of the Huu=e to read a sm*
gl<* paiagraph from the document refei red to After speaking
ol the gieat advantages to the whole Union of one of the great
^ e3tern wo kb to which I have ah eady adverted, the Secretary
proceeds
The advantages, m fact, from the completion of this single
work, as proposed would be so extended and ramified through
out these great divisions of our country, already containing so
lai £r.e a poi tmn of our populanon, and destined in a few gene
rations to outnumber the most populous States of Europe, aeto
leave in that quarter i o other work foi the execution of the Ge
nerai Government, evtx>ptins;  nbj the etten^ion of the Cum
ber/awd road fiom Wheel/rig to St Louts-, which is also
conepwed to be of national impoi tance
Now, Mr Speaker, if m the bill under dt^cuss.on there be
any feature akin o "swindling and plundei,' I ask the gentle-
men from the ¡south to reuin to that gigantic project of kindred
works projected bv their own justly favorite son, and tell me
in whit %ocabuliiy amongst the 'tongues of men" they caa
find epithets odious enough to shadow forth, the diabolical ten
dencies of Aisplan Sir, if this bill be swmdlme, his scheme is
robbeiy If thia bill be petty plunder, his plan was wholesale
desolation Bui £ood or bad, whichever it be, we have h au-
thority for it Well do I remember, sir, in what high esteem
the Secretary of War [Mr Calhoun} was held thioughout the
the West in the year 1S24 The sober affections of the aged,
and the ardent hearts of the youns, all, all were attracted to
him His altars blared every *vheie throughout the broad val-
leys oft he We<=t Right loyally and t rodigally did we pour out
out incense upon his shrine and lo' what now do we see?
Wh'lst the s-moke of our sacrifice yet a«eends in gathering
eloudb whilstthedistendednos'ri'sofourdeit) inhale its grate
fid oi'ors almost to ímifocation, he m whom our affections were
all enshrmed, he the author of this our faith, he the chosen oh

cere idolatry, he, with the ^elected high priests of hia faith,
suddenly rush upon us from the South, overturn their ewn al-
tars, and scourge us, their mioguidedt btHattll bünest devotees 
from the temple themselves had erected Not cotiiejil with
