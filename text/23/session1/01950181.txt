THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

6th of February last, sixteen hundred and thirty
packages of merchandize, wk>ich would soon be
sent to luction i nd -r the 8 h seen n o' the act of
July, 1832 They belonged chiely tj those who
weie unable to raise money to pay the du les at
suoh a cusís If relief was not piomptly granted,
the merchandize woula be sacn*icfd and it would
add to the i uní no v existing He hoped that the
House would not ieverse i •  deci ion, «nd send
the memorial to the Committee on Maiufactures,
wheie we should nevu hear from it again, which
wastoo manifestly theolj ctof themotion 1* was
indispensably neces iry to ex end relief promp ly
to thio branch of tiade The merro-ialists asked
ioi nothins; but an act of sheer j istice, and a
measuie founded in the hour dest po'icy It lela'ed
to the cullection of ihe revenue, and b'bnged to
the Committee of Ways and Means, and he hoped
tue House won d not susuiin the mo'icn to recon
sidcr Us deci ion
Mr HUNTING ION thought, he said, tnat the
resistance of the motion to reconsider came, with
an ill grace fiom the gen le nan fro a New York
United States The memorial stated that, pre-
viously to he establishment of the present bank,
the same state of things existed that now exists, the
samegeneril want of confidence, the same scat city
of money,and thesameinequality in theexchanges
of the country That the establishment of the
bank restored mutual confidence, es'abbshed a
sound currency, and equahz d exchanges, and
was followed by general piospenty The memo-
rial concluded by prayng Congress that the de-
posites may be i estored, or thai, some other measure
b** devised to br ng back confidence to the public
mind The petition, h  said, was signed by two
hundred and fifiy citizens of Portsmouth, of highly
i espectable charactei, men of wealth and ot in-
fluence, and who were entitled to his respect
The memorialists, heobseived, set forth in their
pennon, that it was the duty of the peop e to make
known to their representativ es the wants and griev-
ances of those whom he represented, end the duty
of the lepresentative to la> these oefoie the Legit,
lature In this doctrine Mi II said that he fully
concuired     Cut it was due to the House and to
tares to such a memorial that they conveniently
could
He, Mr  H , voted against the bill of 1833, and the  ] himself, to state the means he possessed of be-
bill of 18 13, but the gentleman from New York
voted for both of those acts    Then he said no lung
about a warehouse system, nothing of tne danger
of losing our canying trade     The effect of the
pioposition of the memorial, which the gentleman
advocated, would be to open the whole subject of
the taulTfor discussion     Does any man suppose
that the comoromise bill would have passed with
oat the provision for the cash payment of duties
Those who wished to agitate the countiy again
with  this subject  wou'd   press ti e   pioposiüon
of the memorialists     A
relief
The CHAIR interposed, and restnc ed the
range of Mr   H 's remarks
Mi CAMBRELLNG agreed with the gentle-
man from Connecticut as to the impropr ety of
opening the ta.iff question again for discussion
corning acquainted with tresentiments and wishes
of his constituents
The town of Poi tsmouth contained between eight
and nine thousand inhabitants, of whom more than
one thousand were votéis This memorial was
signed by two hundred and fifty peisons only
Such a number constituted a minority even of the
votéis alone, and did not include more, or but little
more, than half of the minority who has opposed
his election
There were diffeient opinions as to the cause of
word on tms subject of i the difficulty experienced by the commercial com-
munity That difficulty did exist he was not pre-
pared or disposed to deny, but there might be other
causes for it besides the removal of the Seposites
fiom the Bank of the United States One cause
might have been overtrading, an abuse of the
ciedu system, the dependenceon fictitious capital

He was not disposed to draw any contiast be- . the habit of living beyond men a income, and not
tween his votes and tho e of the gentleman fiom ! the least was undoubtedly the conductof the bank

^                                                 -  ■            ......      i banks in Portsmouth had petitioned that the de-
posites, when íemoved, might be placed there, hut
the Government had seen fit to place them else-
where, and now the names of these same gentle-
men were found appended to a memorial praying
that the deposites might be restored to the United
States Bank
These memorialists declared then belief that the
directors of that bank had conducted Us affans
rathei with a view to the public good than to mere
private emolument, but he saw a'tached to this
memorial the names of some who had petitioned
those directors that the president of the Ports-
mouth Bank might be removed fiom office for
<avont sm New Hampshue contained (he said)
five counciloi districts, eight courties, and twelve
senatorial districts In all of th°se meetings had
been held, and candidates had been nominated,
in view of the election to take place three weeks
fiom to moirow These were all primary meet-
ings of the f eople, delegates, consisting of twice
the number tiey were entitled to in the S ate Le
gislature, had oeen present, and m nearly all of
these meet ngs resolutions had been passed, ap-
provmc of the removal of the deposites, and against
the lechaitcrof the bank, some of these he would
read
Mi H here read a number or resolutions passed
atdis nctmeetmgsintheS'a'eofNewHampshire,
of w1 irh the following was the frst, and the rest
for the compromise bill, and he would tell the
gentleman he knew of ro mteiest in this country,
commeicial,agricultuial,ormanufactuan2,wliici
he was not ready to sacrifice in order to avertfiom
the country the calamities of a civil war
Mr   SELDEN said that he apprehended that
the reading of the memorial would at once put an |
end to this quarrel between the two committees,
and induce the House to send it to a tl  rd com-
mittee     At his lequest, the memorial was read   j
Mr  S  then proceeded to comment upon the ob- j
jec s of the memoiial     The whole was peculiarly
a commercial subject, and, in his opinion, ought
to go to the Commi tee on Commerce    Shou u tl e
raoaon to reconsider prevail, he v. oui i move tl e
reference of the memorial to that commit ee
Mr ADAMS made some lemaiks ir reply to
the gentleman from New York, [Mr Cambre
ix\!,1 and said that tie gentlemai was incoiieet
in supposing that he made the motn. fion- hos
tihty to the object of the memorial He made it
witn a view to prevent th  openinz of a question
which had so long and seuous'y agitated the
couitry What he contended foi was, that this
memorial goes to destioy the compromise of the
lastyeai Some other lemarks he made which
we could not distinctly hear
Mr   CAMBRCLENG spoke m reply to the
gentleman  from  Mas achusetts,  anu  coniei ued

Mr H \RPFR, of New Hampshue, presented
the memoiial of ceiUtn inhabitant of Portsmouth,
New Hampshue, winch he moved be referred to
the Committee of Wtys and Means
Mi H said that the petition complained <t the
disness of the ume, winch it a mbuted to the r 
movil of the pubhcdeposites fiom the Bank ci the
mmaiation of oui venerable Chiet Magistiate
muea*es oui confidence in the wisdom of his
measmes and oui admuation of his firmress and
decision in carrying those measures into eflect
M-sohed, That the lemoval of the public de-
posites fiom the Btnk of tne Unted States by the
Secretary of the Treasury, his our unqualified
approbation
These (Mi H said) w re, in his judgment,
much moie cor-clusu e ev ide ce of public op.nion
than .he two 1 undied and fifty signatures got up
to a pent on in the minnei w ell kno vn to most who
hea d him It v.as to be presu icd tna. the oppo-
nents of the Vdi illustration had got all the signa-
Senatorial convention, in District No 4,
among others, the following resolutions
Resohed, That we recognise m the Secretaries
of the different departments of our National Gov-
erranent men of patriotism, talents, and integrity;
and that in all their official acts (especially that of
Mr Sectetary Taney in removing the aeposites)
they mem the confidence and gratitude of the
American people
Resolved, That in the systematic opposition that
has been so persevermgly urged to General Jack-
son and his administration, we íecogmse the prin-
ciples of old fashioned Federalism, as exhibited
in the days of John Adams, the embargo, and the
late war—which punciples we will fearlessly and
unceasingly oppose
Reso'ved, That our Representative in Congress
be requested to use all constitutional means to
resist a return of the public deposites to the United
States Bank, and a recharter of that anstociatic
and dangeious monopoly
Grafton and Coos councillor district passed,
among others, the following
Resolved, That we regard the Bank of the Uni-
ted States as an institution unconstitutional in its
origin, and dangeious in its operations to the lib-
erties of the country, that its histoiy for the last
five years unfolds a degree of crime and corrup-
tion in the conduct of its affairs without a parallel
in our annals, and richly entitled its managers
to the scorn and indignation of the American
people
Resohed, That the removal of the public depos-
ites from an institution so dangerous and coirupt,
was but an act of justice to the outraged moral
sentiments of an abused and insulted people, and
that, instead of making the removal a subject of
complaint, the bank should have borne the depri-
vation with the meekness of a contute, convicted
culprit
Senatorial District No 1, among others, passed
the following
Resohed, That the withdrawal of the public
deposites at the present juncture is wise, just, and
necessary, and the only means of parrying the
blow which the bank meditated, and has partially
inflicted, on the business community
Resolved, That the Piesident of the United States
has, m withstanding the gigantic advances of this
common enemy, merited the lasiing gratitude of
his country, and is entitled to the support of all
good citizens
District No 10, I find the following
Kesolvd, That the firm and patriotic course
which General Jackson has pursued in relation to
the United States Bank.particularlyas evinced by
the removal of the deposites from that institution,
increases and strengthens his claims upon the grat-
itude end admiration of his countrymen
Resohed, That we approve of the conduct c"
the Secietary of the Treasury in relation to the
removal of the deposites from the United States
Bank, deeming the measure both expedient and
necessary, in order to prepare the country for the
closing up of the concerns of that institution, and
to preven', in a measuie, any act of mischief
which it may be disposed to commit m order to
compel a renewal of its charter
The memorial was then referred to the Com-
mittee of Ways and Means, and ordered to be
printed
Mr BURGES presented a similar petition from
Providence, in Rhode Island, in which he stated
that  they allege that the prosperity heretofore
erjoyed could not be secured, unless the former
relations of amitv that existed between the Govern-
ment and the bank were restored    The memorial
was signed by IOCS peisons, who were nearly all
the votéis of .hat city     And after enlarging upon
the stability  and  industry which was found to
I pervade the Stale of Rhode Island generally, he
I remarked that those pe-sons were actuated  by
i one mint), and not from sinister motives, m giving
their present sent ments     He called for the read-
ing of 'he memoiial, and would then moye that it
be referred to the eternal Committee of Ways ana
l Means
I    The memorial having been retd—
