had no positive word of General Warren. The rumors of the country place him at Allen's Bridge last evening, preparing to cross, some ten miles from this point. As soon as the cavalry come up I will send out detachments for information as soon as possible. The negroes report more firing in a southerly direction yesterday, but not heavy. I made a very good march to this point, indeed. No straggling.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report the return of my command. The troops are ordered to take up their former positions, excepting those from the right. The march having been a long one, they will halt near the rear line and move their positions in the morning. Colonel Kerwin has reported to General Gregg, with his command, and Colonel Burnham, with his command, to General Warren, by his order. At 3 p.m., when my rear left Freeman's,the First Division of the Fifth Corps were in camp a mile or two this side of there. General Gregg, with his cavalry, was following me. The rest of General Warren's troops were crossing the Nottoway, over which were thrown two bridges.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

I am, very respectfully, your obedient servant,
