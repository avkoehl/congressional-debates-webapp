I respectfully recommend that Major-General Breckinridge, with his forces, either be ordered into Kentucky or to join this army.

HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF TENNESSEE,Six Miles from Nashville, Tenn., December 6, 1864.

General G. T. BEAUREGARD,

Macon, Ga.:

Please have the railroad repaired to Decatur as soon as possible. Orders should be given for the impressment of the labor and material necessary at once. The Alabama and Tennessee Railroad is now in good order from here to Pulaski, and can soon be run to Decatur. Have now on it two good engines and three cars. Will have more cars in a day or two. It is important that the garrisons from Corinth to Decatur, including both places, should be garrisoned by troops other than from this army:perhaps the reserves in Alabama and Mississippi could be used for the purpose.

J. B. HOOD,

General.

GENERAL FIELD ORDERS, HDQRS. ARMY OF TENNESSEE,

Numbers 39Near Nashville, Tenn., December 6, 1864.

I. The general commanding desires to call the attention of the officers and men to the fact that success and safety in battle consists in piercing the enemy's lines as quickly as possible after coming under his fire. No halts should be made, except those temporary ones necessary for partial rectification of the alignment.
