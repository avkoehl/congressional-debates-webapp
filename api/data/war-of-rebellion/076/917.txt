Honorable J. A. SEDDON,

Richmond:

The enemy command extending his right about 8 this morning, driving in our cavalry. Lieutenant-Generals Stewart and Lee were directed to hold the Lick Skillet road for the day with a portion of their commands. About 1.30 o'clock a sharp engagement ensued with no decided advantage to either side. We still occupy the Lick Skillet road. I regret to say that Lieutenant-General Stewart and Major-general Loring were wounded. In my dispatch of yesterday I should have mentioned that Brigadier-General Ector was severely wounded during that day.

J. B. HOOD,

General.
