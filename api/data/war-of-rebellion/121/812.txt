EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.

[NOVEMBER 23, 1865.-For Holt to Stanton in the matter of the application of Honorable William Marvin for the pardon (or parole) of D. L. Yulee, S. R. Mallory, and A. K. Allison, see inclosure Numbers 2, Holt to Stanton, January 18, 862.]

FORTRESS MONROE, November 23, 1865.

His Excellency ANDREW JOHNSON,

President of the United States of America:

Mr. PRESIDENT: I have now been during nearly seven months a prisoner in close confinement and under guard, for such was my condition en route to this place. By letters dated the 30th of June, 19th of August, and 1st of October, I asked a trial for my imputed complicity in the murder of Mr. Lincoln, to neither of which have I had any answer. Had your proclamation charged me with the very act of Booth I should not have been more surprised and amazed than I was at being charged with concerting the crime. I had then been absent from Canada nearly six months; had never known or heard of Booth or either of those charged as immediate accomplices, and had not to my knowledge or belief ever seen him or either of them. Conscious of my innocence of either concerting, consenting to, conserving, or being privy to this crime, or anything base, cowardly, or dishonorable, or unwarranted by the laws of war and the example of the United States; confident that no act or word of mine could be tortured into complicity in any such crime, and trusting and expecting that I would ere long be allowed means and opportunity of removing from my name a stain more painful than any wound you could have inflicted on my body, I parted from those who have escaped arrest (despite their dissuasions and admonitions that I would be made, to suffer severely), traveled back to Macon, Ga., 170 miles distant, and surrendered myself to Major-General Wilson.

I left and feel that neither nor life is valuable with a dishonored name. I knew that my own people would not credit my guilt, but I was unwilling that the great world, who did not know me, should doubt my innocence. I flattered myself that neither you nor Mr. Seward would yield credence to this accusation without strong evidence of it. I had shared his hospitality, and according to the morals of barbarians, Arabs, or Indians could not assassinate him. I had been tendered yours and was indebted to you for when in distress at your own town. Besides I thought you accorded me at least courage and integrity, which are utterly irreconcilable with the crime imputed to me. I therefore surrendered myself with the expectation that I would long since have been relieved from a disgraceful charge that has weighed
