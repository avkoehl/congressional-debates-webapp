was in vain, and they are nearly discouraged, and will not work if they think they will be likely to have to leave their farms and crops after partially cultivating them; arming them would be certain to produce that feeling. And if they do not raise grain and something to eat and feed this year there will be none left to protect, for all the country is totally exhausted, and it is nearly as essential to us, for we cannot penetrate to the interior unless they raise forage; for this reason I would not arm or make any ostensible preparations to arm the militia further than as hereinbefore suggested.

The shotgun would be the most available weapon for the purpose I speak of, but for the arming of any considerable number, as a regiment, would not be, as they (the militia) could be only used in defense, or for defensive operations, but would be unreliable for attack or pursuit. Excuse, general, the liberty I have taken in making these suggestions. I feel that they are somewhat advisory where perhaps my opinion is not desired, but they are only suggestions and no impertinence is intended.

I am, general, very respectfully,

J. B. ROGERS,

Colonel, Commanding.
