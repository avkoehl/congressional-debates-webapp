The Constitution provides that " all the laws
necessary and proper for carrying into execution
the foregoing powers " may be passed by Con-
gress.
If the end be legitimate, and within the scope
of the Constitution, all the weans that are appro-
piiate, which are plainly adapted to that end, and
which are not prohibited, may be constitutionally
employed to carry it into effect.
If a certain means to the exercise of any of the
powers expressly given by the Constitution to
the Government of the Union be an appropriate
measure, not prohibited by the Constitution, the
degree of its necessity is a question of legislative
discretion, not of judicial cognizance.
The Government of the United States is not pro-
hibited by the Constitution from issuing Treasury
notes on demand, and making them a legal tender
in paymnt of all debts within its jurisdiction. The
Constitution (article one, section ten) prohibits the

States from making anything but gold and silver
coin a legal tender in payment of debts; but this
does not at all restrict the sovereign power of the
United States. Congress has the power to coin
money, " regulate the value thereof, and of foreign ,
coin." Gold and silver by long practice—a prac-
tice that has continued for centuries among all na-
tions—has become the legal money of the world in
all commercial transactions. Its real intrinsic value
isnotasgreatas that lixed uponitby Governments.
All Governments fix the value of gold and silver;
and without their Government stamp gold and sil-
ver would be asimple commodity, like other things
having intrinsic value. Some Governments fix the
value of coin higher, and some lower; just as each
for itself chooses to determine. Any other metal
or thing that should, be stamped, and its value reg-
ulated by all the Governments of the world, would
pass equally well in all commercial transactions,
as gold and silver, although not intrinsically as val-
uable. Exchequer bills or Treasury notes, whose
value is fixed by Government, and stamped as
money, would pass as money in the payment of
debts within the jurisdiction of the Government
fixing such value.
I n regulating the value of " coin"—either foreign
or domestic—Congiess may provide that gold and
silver shall be of no greater value in the payment
of debts, within the United States, than the Treas- *
ury notes issued on the credit of this Government,
which stamps such coin and fixesits value. These
high powers of Government have been frequently
exercised by Great Britain during her continental
wars, in making thgBank of England notes receiv-
able for public dues, and virtually in payment of
debts,byasuspension of specie payments within
the United Kingdom; and other Governments of
Euiope have exercised the same high preroga-
tives whenever necessary to preserve their exist-
ence. But we are not left to this argument alone
for constitutional power to issue these demand
notes and make them a legal tender in payment
of debts, as I will endeavor hereafter to show.
The Attorney General, in an unofficial opinion,
given to me at my solicitation, says:
"The bill, aftei piovidmg for (he issue of Treasury notes,
contains this clau.-e, namely: 'And such Treasury notes
•-hall be lawful money, and a legal tender in payment of all
debts, public and private, within the United States.' And
you desire my opinion whether tins clause is or is not con-
stitutional.
"•Certainly the Constitution contains no diiect verbal
prohibition, and \ think it contains no inferential ptohibi-
tion that ean he fauly drawn fiom its expressed terms. The
first article of the Constitution, section eight, giants to Con-
fess specifically a gioat mass of powers. Section nine con-
tains divers limitations upon Congress, upon the United
States, and upon individual; and section ten contains ic-
stru-tions upon the seveial Slates Thi* last section is the
only one that tieats of tender. ' No State shall make any-
thing but sold and silver coin a tender m payment of debts.'
Tlu« applies to a State only, and not to the nation; and
thu^ it has been always undei^tood.
" With repaid Jo the next preceding clause in the same
section—cNo ritate shall emit bills of credit;' the prohibi-
tion to emit /tills of cicrfit is quite as stiong as the prohibi-
tion to make anything but gold and silver com a legal ten-
der, yet nobody doubt®, Congress does not doubt, its power
to isfcuo bills of credit- Treasury notes ate bilN of credit,
and I think, one is just as much prohibited as the other.
Neithei is loi bidden to Congiess."
The Constitution provides that Congress shall
have power to pass "all laws necessary and
pioper" for carrying into execution all the pow-
ers granted to the Government of the United
States, or any Department or officer thereof. _
The woid "necessary,"as used, is not limited
by the additional word "proper," but enlarged
thereby.
" If the woid ncccssary woie used in the strict, rigorous
sense.it would be an extiaordinary departuie from the
usual eouise of the human mmd, as exhibited in solemn
iiMnimenis. to add another woid, the only possible effect
of which is to qualify that strict and ligoiou^, meaning, and
to pre-enteleaily the idea of a choice oi means mthe course
of legislation, if no means are to be jesorted to but such
a> ate indnpensubly necessary, theie can be neither sense
nor utility in adding the woidk pioper;"1 for the indispensable
necessity would shut out lrom view all confides ation of the
propriety of the means.''—3 Stonfs Commentaries, sec. 122.
Alexander Hamilton, in discussing these high
powers of the Constitution, says:
'•The audvinties essential to the caio of the common
detln-e aie tho'.o : to lai^c unnie^; to bund and equip fleets
to pre-Ci ibe iuie? ioi the government of both ; to dneet their
opciations to ptov ide foi then support. These powers ought
jo exist without i.ittiiA'iioN ; because it is impossible to
foiOfrU'- or to define the extent and variety of national ex-
igencies, and the coiretpondent extent and variety of the
means necessary to satisfy them. The cncumstances winch
endanger the safety of nations are infinite; and for tins
reason no constitutional sfrackle.-> can wisely be imposed
