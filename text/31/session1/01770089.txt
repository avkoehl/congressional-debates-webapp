liam Thompson, one of the sitting members from
one of the districts of Iowa, to a seat in this House.
On motion of Mr. B., the memorial was referred
to the Committee of Elections.
The SPEAKER, lay general consent, laid before
the House a report from the Clerk of the House
on the subject of the expenditures of the contin-
gent fund,'contracts for stationery, &c.
The report was laid on the table.
OFFICERS OF THE HOUSE.
The SPEAKER stated that the first business
in order would be the resolution heretofore offered
by the gentleman from Pennsylvania, [Mr. Thomp-
son,] and which is in the following words:
Resolceil, That this House will proceed to the election of
Cleric, and other officers, on Thursday the third of January,
1850.
Mr. ROOT moved to amend the resolution by
striking out "Thursday" and inserting "Wed-
nesday."
Mr. THOMPSON was understood to suggest,
that it would be better that the resolution should
remain as it was.
Mr. McLANE, of Maryland, rose to inquire
whether it would be in order to move that when
the House adjourns, it adjourn to meet on Thurs-
day next ?
The SPEAKER said, a motion to adjourn was
always in order.
Mr. McLANE made his motion.
Mr. ROOT asked the yeas and nays, which were
refused.
A brief conversation took place between Mr.
Burt ond the Speaker, as to the question before
the House.
The question was then put by the Speaker, to
strikeout " Thursday," from the motion of Mr.
McLane, and insert "Wednesday," so that the
House, when it adjourns, would adjourn to meet
on Wednesday next.
.The reporter could not ascertain by whom such
a motion was made, if made at all; the only motion
to amend that was heard by the reporter, being
that of Mr. Root to amend the resolution of Mr.
Thompson, by striking out " Thursday" and in-
serting " Wednesday."
The question was taken, the House refused to
substitute Wednesday as the day to which it would
adjourn.
The question was then taken on the original
motion of Mr. McLane, and it was decided in the
affirmative.
So the House decided that when it adjourned, it
would adjourn to meet on Thursday next.
The question then recurred on the resolution of
Mr. Thompson, of Pennsylvania.
Mr. ROBINSON moved so to amend it as to
provide that the. House do now proceed to the elec-
tion of officers.
The amendment was rejected.
And the original resolution of Mr. Thompson
was adopted. .
So the House decided that it would go into the
election of officers on Thursday next.
