to move to you should any exigency require it. Parke is to move out at once with Ferrero's division to you. Clingman's, Hagood's, and Colquitt's brigaders all belong to Hoke's division. According to a deserter's statement you have those three brigades of Hoke's, Mahone's division, and two brigades of Heth's division opposed to you.

HEADQUARTERS FIFTH ARMY CORPS, August 21, 1864-3 p.m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS:

I have ordered your dispatch of 11.10 a.m. and the copy of the one from General Grant to General Meade of 11.20 a.m. for my information and guidance. If the enemy attacks me so as to get a crushing repulse, I will take every advantage of it. If he wishes to get me off, as he has been trying for four days to do, I think he will make a more vigorous effort yet. I am holding myself prepared for it. On my north front he falls back at once into his intrenchments, and if I move west with my whole force I must make another detour to avoid a flank attack while doing it. I lose all the advantage of my artillery as soon as I move and get the effect of his. I believe I have fought against the army opposed to me to know pretty well what to do here on the field. General Parke is now here. He ranks me.

G. K. WARREN,Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC, August 21, 1864-10.40 p.m.

Major-General WARREN, Commanding Fifth Corps:

Do you know how far the railroad party have destroyed the railroad to-day?

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.

I have received your dispatch and will send it.

A. A. H.
