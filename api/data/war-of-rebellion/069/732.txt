ORDERS.] HEADQUARTERS SIXTH CORPS,

June 10, 1864-6 p.m.

As soon as it is dark Brigadier-General Neil, with the disposable troops of his division, will occupy the present lines of the Third Division in connection with his own, and on being relieved, Brigadier-General Ricketts will proceed with his division, and take post on the left of Brigadier-General Russell, taking up so much of the present line of the Second Corps as he can occupy with two lines of battle. Brigadier-General Ricketts will send a staff officer, with an officer from these headquarters, to ascertain the position to be taken up by his troops, and he will exercise great caution in relieving the Second Corps, waiting probably till after the moon has set. In taking positions, General Ricketts will so arrange it with General Russell as to be able to relieve the three regiments of the Second Division now serving with the First Division.

By command of Major-General Wright:

General HUMPHREYS:

We have some guns in position that will be unmasked by day-break. They have orders to open on a battery at that time, but I have just thought that under existing orders I had better ask you if it is desirable to open. The rebel battery has been silent for several hours.
