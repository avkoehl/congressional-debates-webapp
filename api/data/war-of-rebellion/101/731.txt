Captain FREDERIC SPEED,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

I have not yet heard from the scouting party sent out yesterday. Captured a rebel soldier last night who was attempting to evade our pickets. Was dressed in Confederate uniform and found with a Remington revolver. He said he belonged to the Second Louisiana Cavalry. I think that he belonged to some of the roving bands that have been in the neighborhood. We have plenty of forage.

Very respectfully,

WILLARD SAYLES,

Colonel, Commanding Detachment Third Rhode Island Cavalry.
