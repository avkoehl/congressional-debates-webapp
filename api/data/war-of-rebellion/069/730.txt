Major-General HANCOCK:

I saw General Gibbon this evening, and have arranged satisfactorily with him, I believe, in regard to the relief of a part of his division. I send about 3,000 men to take position in his lines. I am sorry to hear you are an invalid this evening.

Major-General BIRNEY,

Commanding Third Division:

GENERAL: The major-general commanding directs that you open the road from Livesay's house by Mrs. McGee's to Wicker's, as indicated in inclosed sketch,* so that it will be practicable for a column. An examination of the road this morning shows that it is practicable for artillery and infantry if widened a little and cleared of undergrowth. A party of 125 or 150 amen will be able to open it in three or four hours. If the sketch is not sufficient plain, Mr. Livesay can give the officer in charge of the party the necessary information.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

C. H. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Chief of Staff.
