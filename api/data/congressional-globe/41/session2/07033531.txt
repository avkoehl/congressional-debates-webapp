THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

extinguish it. They expect, as I believe,that a j
fair expenditure shall be made for keeping up !
every department of the Government. They
are willing, as I believe—I know that, my con-
stituents are, often as we may be reminded of
economy, and that is a rule of action which I
recognize as faithfully represented by the chair-
man of the Committee on Appropriations—they
are willing that public servants shall be fairly
paid for their work ; that there shall be no nig-
gardliness in the conduct of the Government;
that a fair and reasonable civil, military, naval,
and judicial expenditure shall be indulged in
under the rule of economy. As to the Navy 1
Department, I believe that the people are will-
ing and expect that an establishment as large
at least as that which we have at present upon
the waters of the ocean shall be kept up.
Mr. MORGAN. Will the gentleman yield
to me for a question only ?
Mr. HALL. I dislike to yield, and I dislike
also to decline to yield.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman from
Maine declines to yield.
Mr. HALE. I will yield for a question.
Mr. MORGAN. Then I prat to the honor-
able gentleman this inquiry: when he talks of
economy is he aware that the Secretary of the
Navy, in his estimate of the appropriation
necessary for the salaries of naval officers,
has made that estimate $2,000,000 above the 1
amount necessary to pay the legal salaries of ;
the officers of the Navy? If the gentleman i
does not so understand, I am readyso to prove.
Mr. HALE. I do not know that; and I do
not know of any man who does know it.
[Lsughter.]
Mr. MORGAN. I know it, and I will
prove it.
Mr. HALE. I decline to be further inter-
rupted.
The CHAIRMAN. The gentleman will pro-
ceed without interruption.
Mr. HALE. Mr. Chairman, we need a Navy
to protect our commerce wherever it goes.
That commerce before the war. was the wonder
and admiration of the world. It has been re-
duced by causes beyond our control, incidental
to the prosecution, successful as it was, of the
war for the suppression of the rebellion. Re-
duced as it is, the best minds of the age in this
country are now engaged in devising means to
restore it to its former supremacy. There is
no record in the history of the world of any
nation whose people have been given to trade
and commerce that has not at all times kept
up and increased from year to year its navy
for the purpose of protecting its commerce.
More than that, some nations have done what
I believe this nation should not do, continually
pushed out their borders, have extended their
jurisdiction upon the sea-board, in order to
extend their commerce, the invariable result
of which has been the extension of their navy.
No instance can be found of a maritime Power
that has not guarded its navy as the apple of
its eye.
Now, Mr. Chairman, there has been so much
talk about the size of the American Navy that
I propose to give a few figures here, that they
may show, as they did to my mind after ex-
amination, how inferior we are in this respect
to other maritime Powers. The British navy
by its last Register, before the onejustreceived,
and there is but little difference between the
two, had a total of seven hundred and nineteen
vessels of all classes, with a tonnage of six
hundred and sixty thousand tons. The naval
tonnage of Great Britain last year was one
eighth as large as the tonnage of its entire
immense commercial marine, swollen as it has
been by the prosperity of Great Britain in this
respect at the expense of the American com-
mercial marine. Great Britain has ships of war
in every ocean and upon every sea to protect
her commerce, and to make trade upon the
water as safe as the winds and waves will allow.
The mercantile toqnage of England is five
million, seven hundred and seventy-nine thou-
sand tons, and the following are the figures in
reference to the navy of England by the last
Register:
Ships of war, floatingbatteries, receiving-ships,train-
ing-ships in service - 549
Steam screw gun-boats  170
Total   719
In commission, or building, heavy armor-plated
steamships, averaging 3,500 tons each, largest 6,000
tons  40
Tans.
Whole tonnage of the British navy is,  660,000
Whole tonnage of the Navy of tha United
States is  186,552
Proportion of naval tonnage of the United
States to mercantile, nearly one twenty-fourth ;
proportion of naval tonnage of Great Britain
to mercantile, one eighth; proportion of naval
tonnage of France to mercantile, one fourth.
Mr. MORGAN. I desire to ask the gentle-
man a question.
Mr. HALE. I hope the gentleman will
excuse me. The gentleman from Wisconsin,
[Mr. Washburn,] who reported this bill has
stated that he would afford ample time for
discussion, and the gentleman, therefore, can
express his views when he gets the floor.
There were British ships of war, in commis-
sion and in service, exclusive of gan-boats,
block-ships, drill-ships, gunnery-ships, receiv-
ing-ships, troop-ships, &c., from Navy List of
January 1, 1870: armored ships, 26, carrying
423 guns; ships of line and frigates, 17; cor-
vettes and sloops, 35; gun-vessels, 39, carrying
1,116 guns; total armored and wooden steam-
ers, 117; total guns, 1,542.

Besides this, England has small squadrons
at Australia, on the southeast coast of Amer-
ica, and west coast of Africa, the. extent of
which I have been unable to ascertain.
It will be seen that in the coast fleet at home
England has a larger fleet of vessels, of greater
weight arid power of guns and tonnage, than
the United States has in every squadron she
keeps up anywhere on the face of the earth.
France is the next naval Power to Great Brit-
ain. The French navy consists of 430 vessels,
divided as follows: steam vessels, 331, with
76,135 horse-powe*sailing vessels, 99. Of
these, launched but still unfinished, 7 steam
vessels,. *710 horse-power; 81 steam vessels on
stocks, 13,405 horse-power. This fleet is sub-
divided into new fleet and old fleet. New fleet
has 314 steam vessels; sailing vessels, 70; and
is divided into—■
Armored ships of every class 50
Wooden fi^hiing-fleet screw vessels 90
Steam flotilla 90
Transport fleet .-. 75
Training-ships for officers and gunners  2
* Two of the four are floating iron-clad batteries at
Bermuda.
Added this year: 4 iron-plated corvettes, 1
iron-plated coast-guard Rhip, and 2 training-
ships. This represents the real strength of
the French navy. The old fleet is rapidly being
transformed or going out of the service. The
whole tonnage of the French navy is 460,000
tons, or equal to about one fourth of the
whole mercantile tonnage of France, which
is 2,000,000 tons.
The Russian navy comprises in the Baltic
alone 81 vessels, carrying in all 492 guns, with
a tonnage of 112,637 tons, and includes 0
wooden screw Bteamers, ranging from 3,500
to 4,500 tons each; two frigate3 of 6,257
tons and 6,040 tons respectively ; these float-
ing batteries, each over 3,200 tons ; 8 frigates,
ranging from 3,100 to 4,500 tons each, besides
other smaller vessels, from 800 to 2,000 tons.
To these should be added, which are now build-
ing, 6 corvettes, ranging from 3,200 to 4,100
tons each, 2 double-turret monitors of 1,850
tons each, and 4 naval yachts, ranging from 200
tons to 3,000 tons each. In addition there are
2 screw transports, measuring together 1,153
tons; 18sailingtransports ; 23 small steamers,
armed with 32 guns, measuring 4,327 tons, and
9 small steamers, carrying 1 gun each. Her
Baltic fleet alone in material, kind, and num-
ber, nearly doubles the entire fleet of the Uni-
ted States in all her squadrons.
The Spanish navy consists of 128 vessels,
including 10 first-class ironclads, 11 large
screw steamers, 22 paddle-wheel steamers, 26
screw corvettes, 31 gun-boats, and other sailing
and steam vessels. Mr. Chairman, there are
now in the Cuban waters 61 Spanish vessels,
mounting 560 guns. Spain has in weight of
metal, in the Cuban waters, over our own
power, 50 per cent, more of naval force than
we could muster if we should scoop up our
entire squadrons and put them into one and set
them down there.
Even Prussia, which has had no naval out-
look and no naval prospect and no naval pride
or ambition until of late, when she gained her
great ascendency in Europe, has 86 vessels of
all classes, carrying 547 guns, and includes
armored vessels, wooden steamers, and the
other classes known in naval service. It is
being rapidly increased, to keep pace with the
growing importance of the State, with the view
to the absorption by that Power of the smaller
States next to the sea. It is evidently the
design of her statesmen to make Prussia one
of the first-class naval Powers in the world.
Even little Denmark, a fifth-rate European
Power, and having no need of a navy—or at
least with no reason for having a navy to be
compared with ours—has a navy of 33 vessels,
carrying over 400 guns.
Such are some of the navies of the world,
the navies of the Powers that are rivals to our-
selves, and the navies with which, if ours is
ever required at all, it will come in conflict,
Now, Mr. Chairman, let us see what is our
Navy, and what portion of it is at sea, and in
actual service or fit for actual service. The
question is not, Mr. Chairman, what our Navy
was five years ago, but what it is now. During
the war it was enormously increased. I may
state, however, what it was in 1860, as that is
a point of some importance for purposes of
comparison, because it was then upon a peace
establishment. We had five squadrons on
foreign stations, numbering 31 vessels, carry-
ing 455 guns. And besides those abroad we
had at home 10 ships of the line, such as the
Pennsylvania and Vermont, which I suppose
were of little real account, lOfrigates, 21 sloops-
of-war, 3 brigs, 8 screw steamers of the first
class, 6 of the second class, 9 of the third class,
and 7 side-wheel steamers of the three classes,
besides store, receiving, and tender ships.
Then we had some of the best ships that the
world could produce. We had first class screw
Bteamers, like the Niagara, the Colofado, and
the Wabash, of from 3,000 to4,000 tons, which
excited the admiration of naval and scientific
