If Johnson's division were ordered to the north side of James River it would then be necessary to occupy the Junction with at least one brigade of infantry, assisted by such cavalry - at least two regiments - as might be spared from General Dearing's brigade, or other cavalry in the field, to watch closely in front of the enemy's lines across Bermuda Hundred Neck and give timely notice of any offensive movement from that quarter.

I remain, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

G. T. BEAUREGARD.
