HDQRS. HOFFMAN'S BATT., DEPOT PRISONERS OF WAR,Near Sandusky, Ohio, October 17, 1863.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: You mention that you heard that three prisoners attempted an escape by sawing off the pickets, and that if I think best, to board upon the inside. Those men could have sawed a hole thought plank as well as what they did. They would have had more difficulty to get in the saw, it is true, unless they had an auger. I shall put up more lamps. There must be lamps enough so that the sentinels can see, however stormy and dark. It was a very stormy and dark night. It does not do to rely on hearing at all, as the noise, of the waves overcomes very other. The prisoners have exhibited much enterprise of late in the attempts to get out. They have tried digging under ground from sinks; also from quarters, commencing under the buildings. None have been successful and I hope none will be.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. S. PIERSON,

Lieutenant-Colonel Hoffman's Battalion, Commanding.

Colonel WILLIAM HOFFMAN,

Commissary-General of Prisoners, Washington, D. C.:

COLONEL: The smallpox has been brought here by prisoners three times; twice from Alton. Cases well developed have been in the ranks when prisoners arrived, thought I suppose not soon leaving Alton. Hitherto it has been kept under, but is increasing now. There are seven cases in the pest - house. There is much alarm in the prison, and cunning men in there are pretending to be more alarmed than they are. It is one way on the part of desperate men to urge on desperate attempts. I have directed the doctor to do everything in the way of purification; also to have every prisoner vaccinated as soon as possible, and to move out cases as soon as the disease is detected. Of course, it is a had disease in such a crowd.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

WM. S. PIERSON,

Lieutenant - Colonel Hoffman's Battalion, Commanding.
