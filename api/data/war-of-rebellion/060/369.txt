Respectfully forwarded for the information of the General-in-Chief.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.

WASHINGTON, D. C., January 10, 1864.

General SETH WILLIAMS,

Assistant Adjutant-General, Army of the Potomac:

MY DEAR GENERAL: Gibbon has written to me asking for my prompt attention in one matter; I will therefore attend to it at once. In case of a reorganization of the army he wishes in his division his old brigade, the "Iron Brigade" of Wisconsin Infantry, and his old Battery B, Fourth [U. S.] Artillery, which he says would be anxious to join him. It would be very agreeable to me. I suppose the wishes of troops should be considered when known. In such a case I should like my old brigade, too. Put this on file for the contingency.

Truly, yours,

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General of Volunteers.
