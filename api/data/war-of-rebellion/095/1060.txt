the intersection of the Jerusalem plank road which they did with tenacity and success. At this time information reached me that General Potter was dangerously wounded, and I was ordered by General Parke to assume command of the division. Great praise is due to both officers and men for the gallantry displayed, on this occasion. Nowhere on the line were works to be stormed formidable than at this point, but they proved no impediment ot our brave troops.

I would particularly mention Lieutenant Colonel B. F. Taylor, Second Maryland Veteran Volunteers, for the splendid manner in which he handled sorely pressed; also Colonel William M. Gregg, wounded, and Lieutenant Colonel F. B. Doty, One hundred and seventy-ninth New York Volunteers, since died from wounds; Colonel Bradley Winslow, wounded and Captain William R. Wallace, wounded, One hundred and eighty-sixth New York Volunteers; Lieutenant Colonel E. L. Getchell and Major G. A. Bolton, Thirty-first Maine Volunteers, both severely wounded; Lieutenant Colonel P. P. Bixby, Major S. D. Quarles, and Adjt. Abraham Cohn, Sixth New Hampshire Veteran Volunteers, Major L. E. Knapp, commanding Seventeenth Vermont Volunteers, Captain Henry J. Griffin, Sixth New Hampshire Veteran Volunteers, and Captain William Clark, Forty-eighth Pennsylvania Veteran Volunteers, of the pioneer corps; also Captain T. P. Beals, wounded, Captain A. D. Brock, and First Lieutenant W. H. H. Ware, Thirty-first Maine Volunteers of the storming party. Of this gallant party of 108 men, composed of Companies C, H, and L, Thirty-first Maine Volunteers, 5 were killed and 32 wounded.

I would also specially mention the following officers of the brigade staff for gallant conduct in the field: Captain L. N. Sawyer, Eleventh New Hampshire Volunteers, brigade inspector; Lieutenant Ira G. Wilkins, Eleventh New Hampshire Volunteers, acting assistant adjutant-general, wounded; and Captain S. G. Goodwin, Sixth New Hampshire Veteran Volunteers, and Lieutenant Thomas Child, Thirty-first Maine Volunteers, aides-de-camp.
