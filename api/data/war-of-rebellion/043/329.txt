battle of Gettysburg and in defense of human freedom and republican institutions. Of course, you have a detailed statement of the losses of my regiment. * I will add, however, that by the 6th of July 173 wounded officers and men were collected in the seminary hospital, where I lay, from it alone, while many others were in other hospitals or had perished on the field. As you doubtless have an official report, and this is prepared for your own gratification, I have written freely and more at length than otherwise. I have stated nothing, however, but what I know or have good reason to believe to be correct, and consequently hope this report may correspond to or agree with other reports and observations you may have collected.

Respectfully submitted.

Numbers 61. Report of Colonel Roy Stone, One hundred and forty-ninth Pennsylvania Infantry, commanding Second Brigade.

---, -- -, 1863.

GENERAL: I have the honor to report that, in accordance with orders received directly from yourself, at 11 o'clock a. m., July 1, I posted my brigade (One hundred and forty-third, One hundred and forty-ninth, and One hundred and fiftieth Pennsylvania Volunteers) between the two brigades of Wadsworth's division, upon the Chambersburg or Cashtown road and left extending nearly to the wood occupied by General Meredith's brigade, with a strong force of skirmishers thrown well down the next slope, and the road held by a platoon of sharpshooters. The skirmishers having to advance over an open field, without the slightest shelter, and under a hot fire from the enemy's skirmishers concealed behind a fence, did not stop to fire a shot, but, dashing forward at a full run, drove the rebel line from the fence, and held it throughout the day. As we came upon the field, the enemy opened fire upon us from two batteries on the opposite ridge, and continued it, with some intermissions, during the action. Our low ridge afforded slight shelter from this fire, but no better was attainable, and our first disposition was unchanged until between 12 and 1 o'clock, when a new battery upon a hill on the extreme right opened a most destructive enfilade of our line, and at the same time all the troops upon my right fell back nearly a half mile to the Seminary Ridge. This made my position hazardous and difficult in the extreme, but rendered its maintenance all the more important. I threw one regiment (One hundred and forty-ninth, Lieutenant-Colonel Dwight commanding) into the road, and disposed the others on the left of the stone building, to conceal them from the enfilading battery. My line thus formed a right angle facing north and west. Soon after, as the enemy's infantry was developed in heavy force upon the right, I sent another regiment (One hundred and forty-third, Colonel Dana) to the right of the One hundred and forty-ninth. At about 1. 30 p. m. the
