HEADQUARTERS DISTRICT OF WEST TENNESSEE,Memphis, Tenn., January 10, 1865.

Colonel J. N. McARTHUR,

Fourth U. S. Colored Heavy Arty, Commanding Post, Colombus, Ky.:

COLONEL: Your letter of January 5, inclosing telegrams from Brevet Major-General Burbridge and Brigadier General S. Meredith, is received. You are not in General Meredith's command, and will not obey his orders. I have only to repeat my instructions contained in letter of 28th December, 1864, and to reiterate that you will not obey the orders of any officer unless he derives his authority from Major-General Canby, commanding Military Division of West Mississippi, Major-Genera Dana, commanding Department of Mississippi, Major-General Dana, commanding Department of Mississippi, or from these headquarters. You will not permit any interference with your command in any manner whatever by any one deriving his authority from any other source than those above mentioned; nor will you allow public property or material of any kind to be taken from under your control without order through these headquarters. I am not advised that Brigadier-General Meredith has been required to obey any orders of Major-General Dana, and therefore the telegram of Brevet Major-General Burbridge can in no wise affect the case. I inclose for your information a copy of telegram from E. D. Townsend, assistant adjutant-general, at Washington, D. C., of date January 1, 1865, declaring that General Canby's command extended to the mouth of the Ohio River. * You are relieved from any and all responsibility of reporting to General Meredith by my direct and positive order and command.

Very respectfully,

JAMES C. VEATCH,

Brigadier-General, Commanding.
