CHARLESTON, December 13, 1864-1 p. m.

Major General SAMUEL JONES:

Your attention is specially called again to safety of defenses of New River and east of the Screven's Ferry Causeway; they are as essential to safety of forces in Savannah as the position you now hold. Send in time [to] those points any re-enforcements required to hold them; about 450 men are being sent to-day to General Hardee; you are authorized to divert them to those points if necessary.

G. T. BEAUREGARD.

COOSAWHATCHIE, December 13, 1864.

Major STRINGFELLOW:

There is no change in immediate front. Enemy is very busy cutting an avenue from his battery on his extreme left to command the railroad just below this point. He was, I think, hauling heavy guns last night, from the noise and the urging on of animals heard all night. It is too foggy to observe the number of vessels.

W. T. TALIAFERRO,

Brigadier-General.
