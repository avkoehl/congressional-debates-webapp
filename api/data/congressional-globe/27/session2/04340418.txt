eONGÉMgSíOÜAL GLOBl.
Mr BERRIEN explained that the opinion which he enter-
tamed at the time of the adoption of the compromise act, he
still entertained—that it was amply sufficient for the protection
ot Southern interests
With regaid to the elause in the distribution act, he would ask
•what weie the words of the clause1* Were they not these*
* any thing inconsistent wuh the provisions of the compiotmse
aciand the duty of 90 percent" Ihese woids, "inconsistent
with the provisions of the compromise act" were not inserted
needlessly—they meant something, and they were surely en
tided to tnefr full impart. It was the assumption of the facfr 
that the piovisions of the compiomise act will be violated,
whicn he objected to, a* an aigument for restoring the land
iund
Mr WVTKER differed widely from the Senator from Geor-
gia in the construction which he gave to the clause of the dis-
tribution act He read from the journal the propositions which
he had offered to amend the land bill, the veiy day aftet that
bill had been laid on the table
He also read a renewal of the proposition on¿the 20th of August
in fav^r of which the Senator irom Georgia had voted On
the 3tst of August the Senatoi from Georgia himself proposed
an amendment which he read, [page 205, S-.07, Senate Journal ]
The opponents of the distribution then went on the giounds
th<tt no other construction should be fixed upon the act than to
suspend it, if twenty percent duty onany aiticle should be ex
ceeded What is it that the senator fiom Georgi t now con
tends fori Tnat by adopting the home valuation, twenty five
percent may be imposed, and then the compromise act will
not be violated He read from the compromise act the
- tions w ich showed that the levenue forCovernment was to
fixthetate of duty under twenty pei cent hut matin? that the
maxi num The act shows on its face that it was ntvei intend
ed to laise aduty past twenty pei cent According to ..he pro-
visions of the act, the duty should be brought up to twenty per
cent on eveiy article imported, sooner than ex eed it on any one
article If the Senator from Georgia had avowed his piesent con-
struction at the timetheclause wag inserted m the distilbution
bill, that measure never could have been passed He would ven-
ture to say that if there was an individual who gave that clause
any such construction, it must have been the Senator from
Geoiejia himself If he is right, he (Mr W) intended to bring
him to the te^t on that subject, and that test would be the test
of the Supreme Com t of the United States Let the n°w tariff
Jaw in contemplation be passed, and if it is a Ww authorizing
higher duties than the limit of the compromise act, thisdistiibu
turn oinnot be made If it h, the rsupieme Court of the
United States would h we to decide itb authority He doubted
if the Senator from Georgia woul 1, in that cise, venture to ap
pear in court to make an aigument m fa\u of his own con
strucuon líe (Mr W ) wis quite certain the Senatoi from
Rht de T-dand, in naming h'srepoit for a tariff nil I, willnotie
pos mm thecoma uc urn given by the Senator fiom Geeisrta to
the t! m-,0 in the- ih-tubution law fie will demand a legisla
uve enactment ¡specific on that point
He would let tiic, people oí Mis lasjppi, who ate more deeply
in ten -He 1 than any other ¡state, know that if this duty boiaised
to twenty five per cent their taxes will be raised five pei cent
beyond the limit of the compromise act, and it will be seen
that n> such construction as that put upon the clause m the
distribution act by the Senator fiom Georgia will be submit
ted to without contesting the point befo e the Supreme Court
on every possible occasion
Mr BCKRIEN again reiteiated and enforced the grounds as
sumed in his 1 irmei lemarks
Mr LINN iem uked that unless the Senate proceeded to tike
the question on the bill, he would move anadiournment
[Ilert the deban (a meie outl ueof which it, given above, but
which will be published at length as soon as i tcau be written out)

Mi WALKLll said that aftei hearing the declaration of ^e
natorson th« othu -side that they would idheie to the Iind bill
at all hazards, and after then voting down die piopositmn to
can y out that provision of the disttibution act which «uispemhd
that art if the consequence would be an mcreisc of the tanfl
beyond 20 pei cent— iho maxi num of the compiomise aff-
ile considered that a vote in fivor of this hill would he a vo'e
to violate the compromise act, and should theiefoie vote
against it

Mr K saidhehadieaeonto believe that a majority m this
House weie favorable to the iesolmion,and lie was induced to
ask its consideration now, fiom a conviction that the object
wasa highly meutonous one, and would be iciiaed with fa
vor by the country. Knowing the urgency whith existed for
the passage of the appropnaiion bills, he had no desire to
consume time m the discussion of this lesolution, and would
promise, if the Hous-e would agree to tak-e it ui, that he
would occupy but a lew moments for the puri ose of expla-
nation
Mr  HOPKINS rose and objected
Mr HI LMOUE insisted on his mo ion, but, aftet a brief
