HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 6, 1864-12.20 p. m.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

I am constructing a small redoubt on the rear line, which, when the slashing is done, will look to the right to the open country in rear of the Gurley house and to the left to the open plain on which the Williams house stands and command an open view to the front (south) to the woods beyond the Smith house. The rifle-pits will be done by night to the swale bounding the plain on the west where the Williams house stands, connecting with Miles' division at the swale which bounds that plain.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 6, 1864.

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

Your dispatch of 12 m. received. I telegraphed you at 12.20. The rifle-pits of the rear line will be completed before dark and as much slashing of woods as possible.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,September 6, 1864-3.45 p. m.

Brigadier-General WILLCOX,

Commanding Ninth Corps:

The troops holding you line fronting toward Petersburg should be disposed with a view to holding it with a force of 2,000 per mile, including those in the inclosed works on it, and also with a view of holding it with the troops n the inclosed works only. Those troops above the rate of 2,000 per mile should be held in reserve. If nothing occurs between this and the morning it is probable that some part of your surplus command will be sent to the Williams house, and a division from General Warren's corps be sent to the Gurley house.

A. A. HUMPHREYS,

Major-General and Chief of Staff.
HEADQUARTERS NINTH ARMY CORPS,September 6, 1864. (Received 6.40 p. m.)

Major-General HUMPHREYS,

Chief of Staff:

In case Warren relieves Ferrero, by putting Ferrero's division on the line toward Petersburg, I could fill the complement of 2,000 men to the mile very nearly and have both white divisions available; otherwise I shall have to put on parts of both white divisions and divide the organization.

O. B. WILLCOX,

Brigadier-General.
