Making public officers depositories—Mr. Garland.

best security which can be had i" in the adc
quate responsibility oí the depositor, d tha
in every sense oí the word is with the banks
The President seems to be undei the impies
sion that the high obligations of official duty
which the public officers will feel, will afford strong
security against abuses Sir however hones ly the
President may entertain this opinion í regara it
entirely illusory Oihcial parchment never yet
made a man honest who w as natural} dishonest,
nor did it ever ye* protect against the seductive in
fluencesof temptation, where withou'u tvey would
have been yielded to JNothmg, no no hmg, sir,
will resist temptation but the s em and inflexible
principles of integrity which cue implanted m the
heartof man by the God of nature Mr Chairman,
we are not without that most ur erring oí all guides,
ixPtftiEVCF, upon this subject and the re id < f that
experience is decidedly favoraDle to the banks
There has been, «mee the formatioi of the Go en
ment, deposited with, and disomsed by the banks
about S65T 000,000, w th but little oi no loss, ac
cordmg to Mr Crawford' estimate about tle4rth
part of one per cent, while of the money winch
has been kept by individuals, which is mfimtel)
less, muen greater loss has been sustained ¡>
the Treasury Department open to the inspection of
the American people, all its ou standing balan =s
against collectors and i eceivers, and I do not douut
that it will exhibit such decided ev Menees in favor
of the bank deposite system as to decide tnis qies
tion now and forever Here, M1- Cnairmai I
cannot but recur to the experience of my own State
upon this subject, alfhojgh I do it-with much regret
Sir, there -was a man many years ago at the head
of the Treasury Department of Virginia, who -ñas
connected with a family of the h "tiest star ding
and respectability oí he State m whose integrity
every man who knew him had the mosi entire con
fidence—he was proverbial for is honest} Th s
man, under the influence of those kind and benevo-
lent feelings which sometimes dignify and enrolle
frail human nature, but} et mislead it, vv as tempted
to divert to his individual use largei sums of the
public money than he wa  afterwards able to re
store, and thus became recorded a public defaulter
Although he was a defaulter he horestlj sunen-
dered to the Government and his s curities his
whole estate, but it was not sufficient o meet the
whole defalcation TI s man was Jot i Preston,
whose fate affoids ameiancholv proof oí 'he power
of temptation over the human heart for feel con
fident in the assertion that ir life as m ( ea h 1 e
was an hoaest man Wnen this man s> defalca ion
was dis o ^red, the man vv ho became his sue censar
wasa men ber of the State legisla ure and was one
of the most ardent denouncers of the defalcation
and untiring investigators of its extent—his eon
stant cry was ri ucify him crucify him This man,
too, who stood high m public confidence was also
overtaken by the same irresistible temptation and
fell a victim to the same fate He alsow as at heart
an honest man I do net doubt I do not dot i that
the fiscal history of mafiy of the States a ^irds
some melancholy examples of this ki id If we
descend from high State officers to the colic ora
in the counties, wc find many memoraole and
melancholy instances of defalcations in eol'ee
tors and keepers of the levenue With so many
examples, Mi Chanman, before our eyes, will
Congress plunge in'o a system vvneve the in
ducements will be greatei and th" temptations
neces=aril} s longer on account of the immense
sums of money which will be placed within the
reach of individual depos tors I trust not I hope
we shall be warned b} the aangeis of the past and
avoid them for the futurt The colla'eial s ciintv
which mav be tacen b} the Government w ill afford
little or no relief from the effects of defalcation be
cause if the collecting oflieei fails tV Gov ern nent
cannot reach the seem Uie&'exeept ny a t edious course
of litigation, and th°n i ver often fads to leeover
the monej, foi it is now gene a'lv regarded as a
sort oí moral pi maple for a man to secui e his
estate against liability for s c ir tv deb's pa ticu
larly to Government, and it v er\ oAcn happ ns that
before juagment is recovered th° secunties have
by conve} anee and settlements of one d"scr ptjon c i
other, placed their property be) ond the rea^h of exe
cution Another strong argument in favoi of the
State bank system is, that if the public mone} be
plundered from the vaults of the banks, the los  falls
upon the banks i f from individual depo ítoi s the
loss falls upon the Government This fact in creases
* we vigilance and watchfulness of the banks, and re-
14
laxes that of the individual agent Although I fee'
veiy gieat respect for the opinions of the President,
yet I cannot agree with him, that this is a question
betw een the strength of a Treasury and a bonk vault,
neither of these v aults of themselves would ever,
however weak orhowevers rong plunder the pub
he money The} are in arable of that, but the
question is bet1 eer tho^evvlo ^o'dthe leys ot the
vaults, betvu en the m 'iK.em.ents ai d onpr unities
of the one or the other to plunder tn public trea

or a hi ndred lunds
This system il adopte 1, w d "ho exeieise a very
demoralizing influence upo i sou t Noth wis so
