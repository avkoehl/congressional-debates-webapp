knowledge of the Indian character, should alone be selected as a commissioner in behalf of the Confederate States at the meeting of the tribes at Council Grove at the time mentioned, and taking also into consideration the peculiar and direct interest the State of Texas had in the successful termination of this issue, I appointed Brigadier General J. W. Throckmorton of that State to the position without even consulting him, believing he would accept it for the good of the country, and knowing he was well qualified in all respects. In my letter of directions to Brigadier-General Throckmorton I informed him that I should give him no other instructions than such as were contained in the communication of the Secretary of War to me with the letter therein inclosed of Colonel Harrison to himself, above referred to, which were to be his guide. That he would be allowed full discretion for the attainment of the end proposed, that I felt well assured his action would be sustained by me, and recommended to the President for approval. That Brigadier-General Cooper, commanding District of Indian Territory, had been informed of his appointment and directed to have the necessary presents prepared to accompany the commission, the whole expense to be borne by the Government, the commissioner to be allowed in addition $10 per diem, the usual amount. I at the same time forwarded to him an express authority, acting alone or with other commissioners, to effect if possible the proposed treaty with the wild Indians. At the same time I communicated to His Excellency Governor Murrah, of Texas, the contents of the letters from the Secretary of War and of the Indian agent, and calling his attention to the important facts therein set forth, announced to him my appointment of Brigadier-General Throckmorton as commissioner to effect the purpose proposed.

I also gave full information to Brigadier-General Cooper, commanding District Indian Territory, of the appointment of Brigadier-General Throckmorton as commissioner, of the orders issued to Brigadier-General McCulloch, the information to Governor Murrah, and request made of him, and requested him to make out the list of articles necessary as presents and for information as to the exact locality of Council Grove, which was soon afforded.

On the 23rd of March, 1865, Brigadier-General Cooper wrote to me that he would suggest the propriety of permitting each of the Indian tribes, to wit, Choctaws, Chickasaws, Seminoles, Caddos and Comanches, known as Reserve Indians, and Osages in alliance with us, to have one member of their own body to represent his particular tribe, to act in conjunction with the commissioner from Texas, and that an experienced Indian agent should be joined with them, recommending Major Vore. On the 31st of March, 1865, Brigadier-General Cooper again addressed to me a communication containing the information that he was in receipt of a letter from Major Vore, superintendent of Indian affairs for the Creeks, which stated that if too much prominence was given to the State of Texas, as evidenced by the appointment of a commissioner from that State and no other, it might defeat the whole
