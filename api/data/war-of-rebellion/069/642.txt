Major-General HUMPHREYS:

The following dispatch has just been received from General birney, and respectfully forwarded:
HEADQUARTERS BIRNEY'S DIVISION,June 6, 1864.

Lieutenant-Colonel WALKER,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

SIR: In answer to the dispatch from headquarters of the army I have the honor to report that two of my staff have just returned from Bottoms Bridge, and report that the enemy's pickets are on this side of Chickahominy to the lower Sumner Bridge-then, the line is on the farther side; that at the railroad bridge a post is on this side; also at Bottom's Bridge. Our cavalry picket the road and are not on the bank. I find the picket-line of the enemy in my front, near where the creek supplying Barker's Mill empties. Quite a strong one there. The farther bank commands this. The pickets are dismounted, of course, and it is hard to tell whether they are infantry or cavalry. I think those above the lower Sumner Bridge are infantry.

I am, your obedient servant,

D. B. BIRNEY,

Major-General.

WINF'D S. HANCOCK,

Major-General.
