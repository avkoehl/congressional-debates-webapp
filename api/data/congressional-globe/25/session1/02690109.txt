Let it not "be said that the withdrawal of ten or
twelve millions of dollars from the banks, were it
eten true that it >s lo be locked up lor the year, is
to produce anv ruinous effect on the business of a
country requiring a circulation of from one hun-
dred and e ghly to two hundred millions Twelve
millions will be a sufficient sum to carry on the
Government, if economical'} administered, and, it
col'ecied and disbursed as the bill proposes, it will
not be withdrawn from circulation or the general
Use. "While it is being leceived almost daily, it
will be returning to the circulation in pa} ments to
the officers and agents of the Government, and
those engiged in the public voikh, through vhoae
hands it will rass into those of Ihe fttimer-, who
supply them wilh subsistence oí the mechanics
who bu 'cl their houses and mal e heir nnph ments
ot liusb-ri Irv, of the niToha^ts who supplj them
with fcieign enl domestic manufacture and,
though list, not lest w uh m-nv of Us into the
hands of keeper" of hotels and boarding house
Of thA laigr sums whn.h ire almost dailv p"id lo
the heads of departments and their silboidmate
officers-, to members oí the two houses of Con-
gress, to ib.  militan, judicnl, and othei officers of
this  Government how much is locked i pandwi'h-
held from circulation'' is it nota pracucal truth,
which can be attested b} all, lhat most of it is
immediately pa d out a,am to some of the other
classes'* How manv memheis of Conertss, heads
ofdepan tents 01 clerks, did an} oneeier know
to hoard money 01 get rich' The questioi is
almost enough to produce a me'aneioty smile
A member of Congress, or any other officer of the
Government, get rich' Why, sir, it is absurd '
we all (at least many of us) can loo truly attest
the gioundlessness and absuidity of such a piopo-
siliori
Then, vhv talk of abstracting from the business
operations of society the amount of the necessary
revenue for the snppoit of Government, as if, like
the miser, t^e recipients would lock it up, or place
it in the itirng box uf oui Treas uv, nc ei 3'im to
see the 1 sht ot day" Anj such idea must be, prac-
tically, withoulfoundation With whatpropnetj can
gentlemen insist that we are establishing one cui-
rency for ourselves, and another for the people
Wo Sen iter ha^ p oposed, and I venture to saj no
one  ill propo e, that the public dues should be le
ceived in any thing but gold and silver, specie pav-
ing bank papei, or Goiernment securities oi paper
No one, here, has offered a propo mon that the
Government shall receive depieciattd Mult paper
and I trust never "will Do gentlemen pretend that
it is for the individual benefit of the oiiiceis of Go-
vernment, trift specie, oi its equivalent, is rtqu red'
On the enntran , is it not to sustain the Govern-
ment and it-, credit and to give efficiency to its
operat onsi
Ii his been wtll maintained, that it will have the
effect of making the local bank oarer better The
issues of Ine banks beirg restricted their paper
will be convertible into specie, tor all local pui-
poses, it east, t will be of equ^l alue, and an-
swer the same ends, and if the b nk« are rendered
sound, any one hiiing iheu paper may get the

seems to have been transfeired 1 rom the deoosite

We find some of those, who formerl} held these

they have failed to reah/e the hopes and ex-
pectations of the Administration ant1 the people,
leady to continue them, and deprecating the adop-
tion of the policy recommended, as dangerously
increasing the power of the Executive' Accordirg
to my view of the subject, the Executive power
and patronage will le greatly diminished b} the
pioposed change It has not b°en vet recommended
Ly the Secretary of the Tieasurj, so fir as I have
seen, lo increase the number of collecting and dis-
bursing agents; and I sec little recessitv for the
employment" oi any additional officers, unless it be
a few clerks In most p'aces, the sime officers
who have heretofore collected and paid ovei the
public revenue to the banks, can collect, k°ey>, and
pav it out with equal facility But, suppose one
hundipd additional ofPcers were necess-ry, \'ou'd
it so increase the power ol the Fxecutive as to com

Su, the Gove nment onirht, alwavs, to be able

that this on not be expected while we rclv on
banks Gentlemen tell us, tnat although the State
banks have failed to meet our expectations, we
ought to continue then agency They ask us,
wculdwe discontinue the use sf steamboats, be-
cause a boilei may sometimes explode and produce
fatal results' By no means, sn, while care and
skill mav reasonably be expected to msme safety,
and prevent such calamities But were we to

lable and the boiler liable to spontaneous combus-

Baltimoie on, Sunday According to the news-
papers of the day, >t was said by wav of justifica-
tion, "theie were no Sabbaths in xevomtionafy

Slates bank can not be touched without an attempt
to produce excitement and agitation 11 affords
one of the most conclusive íeasons agam&t the es-
tablishment of such an institution, lh>>t it has tn 
ability to produce such tremendous effects The
concenlration of such an immense moneyed power,

It would soon contiol all our elections, from the
highest to the lowest, and direct the operations, nay
usurp the powers, of the Government itself

* To pay the debts" of the nation is a power as
expressly confided to Congress, and the Executive
officers of the Guiernment, as any other to be foand,
in the Constitution In the performance of this
duly, about the me nth of Maich, 1832, the Secie-
tarv ol the Tieasurj gave notice to the president of
