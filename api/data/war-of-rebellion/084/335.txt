In each of the Missouri State Militia regiments a captain and first lieutenant will be selected by the commanding officer thereof to recruit in the regiment for the new organization. These officers will be selected with care as the best representatives of their grade in the regiment, and will be eligible for appointment in the new organization should they succeed in securing enough recruits to form a company. These officers will report to Colonel John W. Du Bois, chief of cavalry of the department, from time to time, their success in recruiting, and when they have enough men to constitute a maximum cavalry company will receive further orders for the discharge and remuster of the men.

The non-veterans who re-enlist will be required to enlist for three years, or the war, and receive the bounty of $100, provided by the act of Congress approved July 1, 1861 (see General Orders of War Department, No. 49, or 1861), the bounty to be paid under the regulations promulgated in General Orders, No. 163, series of 1863, from the War Department.

In the new regiment no men will be received with private horses. The mounts will be furnished by the Government.

As a check upon improper selections of officers for the new regiment it is to be understood that all officers may be at any time ordered before a board of officers for examination as to their qualifications and fitness for command.

By command of Major-General Rosecrans:

O. D. GREENE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
