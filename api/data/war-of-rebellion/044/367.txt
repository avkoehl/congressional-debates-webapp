command was marched to the left, beyond the point at which we had

before halted, and thence, under cover of the woods, to the right of

our line of battle. Arriving at the school-house, on the road leading across the Emmitsburg road by the peach orchard, the in possession of the enemy, the lieutenant-general commanding directed me to advance my brigade and attack the enemy at that point, turn his flank, and extend along the cross-road, with my left resting toward the Emmitsburg road. At the same time a battery of artillery

was moved along the road parallel with my line of march. About 3p. m. the head of my column came into the open field in front of a

stone wall, and in view of the enemy. I immediately filed to the

right along and front of the wall, and formed line of battle under

cover of my skirmishers, then engaged with those of enemy, these

extending along the Emmitsburg road.

In the meantime, examining the position of the enemy, I found

him to be in superior force in the orchard, supported by artillery,

with a main line of battle intrenched in rear and extending to

and upon the rocky mountain to his left far beyond the point at which his flank had supposed to rest. To carry out my instructions, would have been, if successful in driving him from

the orchard, to present my own right and rear to a large portion

of his line of battle.
