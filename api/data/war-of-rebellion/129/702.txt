PAIRS, AVENUE GABRIEL 48,

October [1], 1864.

Hon. JAMES A. SEDDON,

Secretary of War, Richmond, Va.:

SIR: Our last was of July (No. 6), advising you that an arbitration had been ordered relative to the accounts of Messrs. Isaac, Campbell &amp; Co., and that an adjourned interview between Mr. McRae and Mr. Saul Isaac was to take place the following week. We have now to add that aht interview was without favorable result, as was also a preliminary arrangement entered into between Mr. Isaac and Major Huse, which the latter thought would lead to a settlement on terms which we could approve.
