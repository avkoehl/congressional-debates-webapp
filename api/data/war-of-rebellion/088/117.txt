At 11.30 a. m. thirty-six wagons seen moving toward our right on road near lead-works. A force of cavalry have just passed on the Richmond and Petersburg road going toward Richmond. They were ten minutes passing and were followed by six wagons. Another company followed the wagons, taking four minutes to pass. There were two flags, both red. Wagons have been passing just beyond on same road for about twenty minutes, going toward Richmond. I counted thirteen before the cavalry came and thirty after they had passed.

GENERAL: The following dispatches are respectfully forwarded:

PLANK ROAD SIGNAL STATION.

At 2.30 p. m. a body of cavalry moved to our right on line of Weldon railroad, followed by a train of fourteen wagons, but owing of the smoke intervening, blown from the burning woods upon our left, a correct estimate as to the number of cavalry could not be made. They probably numbered 500; were ten minutes in passing. No other movement visible since last report. No change in camp visible.
