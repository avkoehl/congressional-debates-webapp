HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 1, 1864-6 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

Sheridan's orders require him to return as soon as any definite intelligence of Wilson's command was received, and he has been notified of Wilson's safe return.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 1, 1864-10 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

General Wilson having returned, orders have been given to General Sheridan to withdraw to Prince George Court-House, and there to reorganize the cavalry, and prepare them for further service. He is directed to detach one brigade to picket on the left flank of the army. The Sixth Corps is directed to resume its former position, and General Ferrero's division will be sent to take post on the Norfolk, or Baxter, road where it crosses the Blackwater Swamp. The enemy has been passing in considerable force to-day into Petersburg, on a road just south of the Weldon railroad. This is probably the force sent to support the cavalry when Wilson was attacked, with perhaps re-enforcements sent out when Wright's movement was reported. It seems to be pretty well ascertained that supplies are brought on the Weldon road to Stony Creek Depot, and wagoner from thence to Petersburg. If the cavalry was in better condition this might be stopped. The mere occupation of the Weldon railroad will not do it, as by making more of a detour they can reach the part of the road where the trains stop by using roads nearer to the Appomattox and then moving across to the Weldon road.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.
HEADQUARTERS ARMY OF THE POTOMAC,July 1, 1864-10 p.m.

Lieutenant-General GRANT:

I have received a letter from Mrs. Wadsworth, the widow of General Wadsworth, inclosing one for General R. E. Lee, asking the return of certain articles found one the general's person. As I do not feel authorized to send a flag of truce without your sanction during your presence in the field the subject is respectfully referred to you.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General, Commanding.

CITY POINT, July 1, 1864.

General MEADE:

I do not think it a fit time just now to send Mrs. Wadsworth's communication through, but the first time a flag is being sent for any other purpose it can go.

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.
