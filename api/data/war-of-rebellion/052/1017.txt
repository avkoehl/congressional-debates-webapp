HEADQUARTERS FIRST DIVISION,September 29, 1863. (Received 12.30 p.m.)

Major-General CRITTENDEN,

Commanding, &amp;c.:

GENERAL: I have examined the valley on the left of General Van Cleve's line, and do not think it a good position for a work for guns, as the guns would have no command in so low a place, and a very narrow sector of fire. Besides, the position is completely dominated by our work in the reservoir, and would be by any guns the enemy might plant on the high grounds in front. But I would immediately have a strong line of rifle-pits run across the valley from the spur of the hill to near the present water line of the river.

Respectfully, &c.,

TH. J. WOOD,

Brigadier-General of Volunteers, Commanding.

INDIANAPOLIS, IND., October 26, 1863.

Major General W. S. ROSECRANS,

Cincinnati:

GENERAL: I am much annoyed by a statement which I see in the newspapers, that I had charged you with misconduct in the battle of Chickamauga. There is not a word of truth in this statement. Even in conversation about this battle I have never uttered a word of censure against you. I do not believe that you can for a moment credit this statement, but others may, and you are at liberty to make this contradiction public now or at any time.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

T. L. CRITTENDEN,

Major-General, U. S. Volunteers.
