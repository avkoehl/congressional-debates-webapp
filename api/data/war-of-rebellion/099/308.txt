Assistant Adjutant-General.
HDQRS. MILITARY DIVISION OF THE MISSISSIPPI,In the Field, Buford's Bridge, February 5, 1865.

Major-General LOGAN,

Commanding Fifteenth Corps:

GENERAL: I have instructed General Howard to move the Right Wing and make a lodgment on the South Carolina Railroad in the neighborhood of Bamberg. You may therefore, in anticipation of the movement, make orders for the Fifteenth Corps to take the direct road by Duncanville. Kilpatrick will move by Barnwell, and I have ordered General Williams to cross the Big Salkehatchie by this bridge, then take the Barnwell road out as far as Ayers', where a road branches to Blackville. He will follow that to about Nimmons', trusting to find some road leading up to Graham's or Duncanville. I would like, if possible, that Hazen should be on the north side of the Barnwell [road] by 8 o'clock, so that Williams can pass him, and that the two armies should not get mixed at the place where Hazen's camp now is.

I am, yours, &amp;c.,

W. T. SHERMAN,

Major-General, Commanding.

Major-General HOWARD,

Commanding Department and Army of the Tennessee:

GENERAL: My corps is encamped at the points indicated by your order of yesterday: First Division at Chitty's, Third at Moye's, and Second at Dr. Hayes'. I sent out to-day to Little Salkehatchie fifty mounted men. Found the bridge burned and the swamp, some 300 yards, badly obstructed, with the enemy posted on the opposite side, said to be one brigade. There is an abundance of meat, forage, &c., in the country.

I am, general, very respectfully, your obedient servant,

JOHN A. LOGAN,

Major-General.
