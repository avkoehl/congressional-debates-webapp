Mr. ANTHONY. Is it in type?
Mr. POMEROY. I am told that the type is
not distributed.
Mr. ANTHONY. I have no objection to the
amendment.
. The VICE PRESIDENT. The Chair will
state that by law lie thinks this proposition
must go to the Committee on Printing.

Senate, but a law of Congress, and therefore
I do not think unanimous consent can dis-
pense with it. I have no objection to the prop-
osition if the report is in type; but if the Sen-
ator will offer a separate resolution it will go
right through.
Mr. POiiEROY. I only say the present
Commissioner finds himself without a report.

will be regarded as offered and referred to the
Committee on Printing. The question is on

submitted by Mr. Shep.mak on the 16th instant :
liesohed, That as organized bands of desperate and
lawless men, mainly composed of soldiers of the late
rebel armies, armed, disciplined, and disguised, and
bound by oaths and secret obligations, have by force,
terror, and violence subverted all civil authority in
large parts of tho late insurrectionary States, thus
utterly overthrowing thesal'ety of persons and prop-

basis and object of all civil government antl which
are expressly guarantied by the Constitution of the
united States to all its citizens, and as the courts
are rendered utterly powerless by organized perjury
to_ punish crime: Therefore,
The Committee on the Judiciary is instructed to
report a bill or bills that will enable the President
and the courts of the United States to execute tho
laws, punish such organized violence, and secure to
all citizens the rights so guarantied to them.

view of a state of affairs unexampled, either

as we can gather from the newspapers of the
South and as are conveyed to us by telegram

United States. This resolution which I have
drawn contains nothing but what is literally
