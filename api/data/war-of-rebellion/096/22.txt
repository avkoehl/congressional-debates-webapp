to the quartermaster; three of these are coaled; no one knows what they are here for. I suggest one of them-the Atlantic-to take the place of the Illinois.

Lieutenant-Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.

FORT MONROE, January 3, 1865-1 p. m.

General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

There have an abundance of vessels reported, but for want of dock accommodations coaling is a slow operation. Coaling is the hitch. There are nine vessels ready for sea. They will carry 4,475 men. I have decided to take everything that is fit and is coaled. By doing this we will get through, I hope, by 10 o'clock to-night. Will report when through.

M. R. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.

CITY POINT, VA., January 3, 1865-2 p. m.

Lieutenant Colonel M. R. MORGAN,

Chief Commissary, Fort Monroe:

The extra vessels you speak of, as having reported to the quartermaster, are evidently intended to make up the fleet you are rationing, and Captain Howell, assistant quartermaster, has been directed to so instruct the quartermaster at Fort Monroe. Ration them same as others and soon as possible. If any vessel is so large it can not get up here, the troops it is to carry will be sent to Fort Monroe in river transports.

By command of Lieutenant-General Grant:

JNO. A. RAWLINS,

Brigadier-General and Chief of Staff.

FORT MONROE, January 3, 1865-5.30 p. m.

General RAWLINS,

Chief of Staff:

Since my last, four vessels have been ready for sea; they will carry 2,150 men. The Atlantic, 1,400 men, cannot go up to City Point; she is not watered, but she will be to-night, and ready for sea in the morning. General Ingalls has asked for the spare transportation to be sent to Baltimore; it has been so ordered.

M. R. MORGAN,

Lieutenant-Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.

FORT MONROE, January 3, 1865-6.30 p. m.

General RAWLINS:

By summing up you will see that the Atlantic alone is unprovisioned. I may then say that all is ready, as the Atlantic cannot go up to City Point; and before troops come to her she will be ready.

M. R. MORGAN,

Lieutenant Colonel and Commissary of Subsistence.
