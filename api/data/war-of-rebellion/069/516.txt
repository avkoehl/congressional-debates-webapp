General GILLMORE:

What force drove in your picket-line, and forced it in several places? Digging rifle-pits for the enemy to occupy does not seem to be the most pleasant work. Send in any prisoners or refugees you have.

Major-General, Commanding.
HEADQUARTERS TENTH ARMY CORPS, June 2, 1864-8.40 a. m. (Received 9.10 a. m.)

Major-General BUTLER,Commanding:

Your dispatch was received just as I was going out. The attack made by Colonel Dantzler, to which your dispatch refers, was a trifling affair and easily repulsed. I presume the prisoners taken there knew nothing of any operation, except the one in which they were engaged. That took place on General Terry's extreme left. His entire line was attacked on the right by a close line of skirmishers, elbow to elbow, supported by a line of battle. I have last 10 officers and probably 200 men in killed, wounded, and missing. All this loss was on Terry's right and not near Colonel Dantzler's attack. The information given by the prisoners is not at the right as to what they saw rather than those of men half a mile distant.

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

GILLMORE'S, June 2, 1864-8.45 a. m.

General BUTLER:

General Terry reports a heavy force in his front, but does not give numbers. We have taken some prisoners and lost some of Seventh Connecticut. I yesterday ordered General Kautz to replace the pistols in his command by muskets. Are there any on hand near here?

Q. A. GILLMORE,

Major-General.

JUNE 2, 1864-9.10 a. m.

General GILLMORE:

Dispatch received. Mordecai reports 120 rifles, which he will furnish Kautz. If the woods are occupied in heavy force by the enemy, a vigorous shelling might do injury to them.

BENJ. F. BUTLER,

Major-General, Commanding.
