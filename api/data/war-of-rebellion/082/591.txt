I leave for you to make out. I directed General Sheridan, whilst we were at Deep Bottom last evening, to move his command immediately to the left of Warren from Deep Bottom. It will be well to direct the cavalry to endeavor to get round the enemy's right flank. Whilst they will not probably succeed in turning the enemy, they will detain a large force to prevent it. I will go out this evening to see you; will be at your headquarters about 4 p.m.

Very respectfully, your obedient servant,

U. S. GRANT,

Lieutenant-General.

P. S.-If you want to be any place on the line at the hour indicated inform me by telegraph, and I will meet you wherever you may be.

CITY POINT, July 29, 1864-1.15 p.m.

General MEADE:

I earnestly impressed on Hancock yesterday the necessity of occupying a strong line, intrenching it, and preparing for a heavy attack to-day, which I deemed probable when the enemy had accumulated a heavy force. I have now sent him your telegram. Your note by Captain Hudson just received. Ord has been with me all the morning. We have been over the line and if conference with Burnside. I will be at my quarters at 4 p.m., it being about as near as any part of the line.

GEO. G. MEADE,

Major-General.

"The wagons cross the pontoon over the Appomattox; then can't see them after they leave the pontoon, but from the dust I suppose they take the road for Bermuda Hundred.
