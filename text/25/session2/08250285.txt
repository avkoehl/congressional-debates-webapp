of that institution in their hands. Another, and a
very important fact is required, which is, that the
person having such property in his possession,
must be the agent or trustee of the expired corpora-
tion, and possess the assets thereof, for the purpose
of paying the debts of that institution. The bill,
therefore, by its express terms, is confined to per-
sons who possess the property of the late Bank of
the United States for a particular purpose, who as-
sume to act for and in behalf of that institution,
and who violate the trust which they have underta-
ken to perform.
"What, then, is the object of the law it is proposed
to pass, and what are the means by which that ob-
ject is to be effected1 If either are beyond the juris-
diction of Congress, it must be conceded that the
bill cannot be sustained. The object of the law is
to compel the winding up and final settlement of
the concerns of the Bank of the United States, or
any other corporation established by Congress, and
this is to be effected by affixing a penalty and pun-
ishment to such acts of the agents of any such cor-
poration as constitute a gross abuse of the powers
conferred on the institution, and of the authority of
this Government. Can there be any doubt that the
legislature which creates a corporation, possesses
the authority to see to the winding up of its con-
cerns, and to compel this to be done by pains and
penalties, it it shall be found necessary?
Mr N said he was considering the question,
without reference to the opinions of those, of whom
he was one, who do not believe that Congress has
any power to incorporate a bank he should notice
that objection before he closed his remarks Con-
gress established the Bank of the United States, and
conferred on the coiporation certain powers, whieh
was really a delegation of a part of its own powers
it by the same act created certain rights, which had
no existence, independent of the act of Congress
These rights were not natural rights, and pre-exist-
ing, but were entirely artificial, and derived their
existence from the exercise of the sovereign power
of this Government The act created certain rights
m the corporation, certain rights in the United
States, and certain rights in individuals, who might
become creditors of the corporation. Having cre-
ated these rights, Congress must have the power,
and it must be its duty, to protect and defend them
it must protect the rights of ths corporation, the
rights of the United States, and the rights of indivi-
duals springing from the corporation To deny
this power, would be to maintain the absurdity that
Congress could create rights and interests which it
had not power to defend, and which could not be
protected by the States. The States can have no
cognizance of corporate rights originating from
Congress. No one, he thought, would maintain a
proposition so unreasonable and inconsistent.
That Congress has the power, and that it is its
duty, to protect the rights of the corporation and of
individuals, originating from it, during the exist-
ence of the charier of the bank, no one will per-
haps deny. And it is equally clear that, during (he
life of the corporation, Congress has the power, and
that it is its duty, to supervise the acts of the cor-
poration, and see that it does not abuse its powers,
to the injury of the United States or of individuals
And hence it is that there was a provision in the
charter for the appointment of a committee, by
either house of Congress, to inspect the books, and
examine into the proceedings of the corporation, to
determine whether its acts were in conformity to its
charter, and m case such committee should report
that the charter had been violated, it was made the
duty of Congress to direct the issuing of a scire
facias, to vacate and set aside the charter of the
bank In ease also the President believed that the
charter had been violated, it was his duty to order
a scire facias to be issued against the corporation.
These provisions in the very law which created the
institution, rest on the principle that it is compe-
tent and proper for Congress to watch over the
corporation, to see that it does not abuse the powers
conferred upon it, and to guard the rights of the
United States and of individuals. It is on the
•same principle that the charter contains a provision
making it felony, and punishable by confinement
at hard labor, to counterfeit the notes of the bank,
deriving which, their existence from the authority

of this Government, Congress must have the power
to protect them, and to protect the public, against
an abuse of its own authority. There is no provi-
sion in the Constitution expressly conferring on
Congress the power to punish counterfeiting, except
of the current coin or the public securities of the
United States But if it has power to establish a
bank, and to give legal validity to a paper curren-
cy, it must possess, as a part of that power, the
right to protect the same, and to do this by penal
enactments, if deemed necessary. These princi-
ples do not seem to be denied, so far as respects the
period for which the bank was created, but it is
claimed that when the term has expired, the au-
thority of Congress must cease This cannot be,
because both the power and the duty of this Go-
vernment extend to the final settlement and winding
up of the concerns of the corporation The act of
incorporation is regarded as a contract, and it is an
essential part of that contract that all the concerns
of the corporation shall be settled and closed, and
the rights which originated from it become extin-
guished. When there are no rights remaining,
either of the corporation, of the United States, or of
individuals, which were created or originated from
the authority of the act establishing the bank, then
the jurisdiction of Congress will be at an end, be-
cause there will be nothing on which it can ope-
rate.
The twenty-first section of the act of incor-
poration provides, "that, notwithstanding the ex-
piration of the term for which the said corporation
is created, it shall be lawful to ose the corporate
name, style and capacity, for the purpose of suits
for the final settlement and liquidation of the affairs
and accounts of the corporation, and for the sale
and disposition of their estate, real, personal and
mixed, but not foi any other purpose, or m any other
manner whatsoever, nor for a period exceeding tu o
years after the expiration of the said term of incor-
poration "
Upon the face of the act it thus appears that the
corporation did not cease to exist at the expiration
of the term for which it was created. Its powers of
doing business ceased, but it had a legal existence
for the purpose of winding up its concerns This
provision in the charter makes it the duty of the
bank to collect and pay its debts within two years
after the expiration of the charter, and this is a part
of the contract obligator/ on the corporation If
this has not bean done it is a direct violation of the
contract And is it not as clearly within the power
of Congress, and as much its duty, to see that this
part of the contract is not violated as any other?
The bill before u  is designed only to enforce the
obligation expressly created by the charter, it is not
creating a new obligation, but only enforcing one
which has always existed The original act im-
posed a duty on the corporation, but contained no
penalty or sanction to enforce it We now propose
to add a penalty to a gross breach of trust That
this penalty could have been attached to ihe act of
incorporation w ill hardly be denied And if it
could have been done tl en, cannot Congress do it
now? A violation of the charter, and an abuse of
the authority of this Government, involving a fraud
on the law and on the public, are acts which Con-
gress must have ihc power to restrain, and to do it
by penal enactments This was, m part, provided
for in the original charter, but, if further legislation
is found necessary, either to protect the rights of the
corporation, or the United Stales, or the public, it
can be supplied at any time afterwards
Supposing there had been no provision in the
charter against counterfeiting the notes of the bank,
could not Congress, at a subsequent period, have
passed an act for that purpose? Would this be
claimed to be an interfeience with the contract, ard
either enlarging or diminishing the pou ers of the
corporation' And upon what principle could this
be done1' Certainly upon no other than that Con-
gress possessed general jurisdiction over thesubject,
that, having created the corporation and authorized
the issuing of its notes, it must have the power to
protect the corporation and the pubnc against a
iraud practised upon both And will ¡t be con-
tended that Congress, has power to restrain and
punish frauds, by individuals, against the corpora-
tion, and not to prohibit and pumsh irauds com-

mitted by the cerporatio  to the injury of the
public?
It will hardly be denied that daring/ the two
years Congress had power over the corporate ,
and could have restrained and punished frauds
against the institution, or frauds committed by its
agents against the public It could also have pun-
ished any gross abuse of the powers conferred on
the corporation Bat it is said that when the two
years expired the corporation was entirely extinct,
and that Congress could have no further jurisdic-
tion over the subject. If the institution was en-
tirely extinct, then it would be true that the jurisdic-
tion of Congress would be at an end, because there
would be nothing on which it could operate But
the corporation would not be extinct until it had
fully and completely executed its trust, and this
could not be done until its debts were collected and
paid, its property disposed of, and its affairs finally
settled. Suppose the agents of the corporation
entirely neglected, during the two years following
mg the 4th of March, 1836, to take any steps to
close its concerns, neither collected its dues or paid
its debts, or disposed of its property what would
be the consequence' The corporation could not be
sued, and would the creditors be remediless?
And if the corporation was entirely ext net, to
whom would the property belong' Sir, it is apparent
that the institution cannot be regarded as entirely
extinct by the mere expiration of the term for
which it was created. That only suspends the
exercise of its powers, yet it may exist in contem-
plation of law. By its charter, the Bank of the
United States was authorized to exercise its full
functions for twenty years, after that period, it was
allowed two years to exercise cer'am of us func-
tions for closing up its concerns But if ks affairs
were not closed, by a gross neglect or a fraudulent
non user of its powers, can it be said that the juris-
diction of Congress over the subject is gone'
Can it be said that the institution is extinct whilst
all its assets, its contracts, debts, credits, all re
main' Certainly not, as this wou'd b  to expose
the stockholders, creditors, and all any way inte-
rested in the institution, to the grossest injustice
and fraud     It would leave them wi'hout rerredj
In such a state of things the functions of the cor-
poration would be suspended, but they might be
revived, or Congress might appoint trustees to take
possession of the assets of the bank and close is
concerns, and could punish the agents of the insti-
tution who had its assets in their hands for refusing
to deliver them over to trustees. During fte pre-
sent session we have passed an act to extend some
of the functions of the bank, to enable it to main-
tain suits and to be sued We have, therefore,
expressly recognised the corporation as being Mill
m existence, so far as it regards the winding up of
its concerrs
Suppose, that under the provisions of the char-
ter to which he had referred, a scire lacias had been
issued, and the charter, during the twenty years,
had been adjudged to be forfeited, and had been
annulled and set aside, bow would its concerns
have been settled? There is no provision in the
charter, no power conferred on the Federal court*,
to proceed any further than to adju Ige the charter
forfeited, and to annul it. Would ltnot have been
competent for Congiess to ha-re passed a law pio-
vidtng for closing its concern*' and could it not
have punished any fraudulent act of any agent of
the corporation, who should convert the property,
or expose the public to injury by issuing the noleo,
or exercmag any of the powers of the corporation,
after it had been adjudged to be void, and had been
annulled'
Sir, ihe power of Congress attempted to be
maintained is exercised by alt the State Legisla-
tures They all punish Irauds commuted by «he
officers and agents of banks during the existence of

■tuer ¡heir charters exp-re or are forfeited In some
oí the States, this power is conferred upon the
courts, which are authorized to graal injunctions,
to appoint trustees, and to superintend the final
winding up of their affairs. Bat the authority
ol the courts, is derived from the Legislature, which
must possess jurisdiction over the whole subject,
and caa exeictse it as u thinks most expedient.   la
