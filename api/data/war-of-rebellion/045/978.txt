RICHMOND, July 6, 1863.

General SAMUEL JONES, Dublin Depot:

Dispose your forces without delay, so as to have, as you propose, 3, 000 infantry for movement by rail to Gordonsville or here. If, consistently with this, the troops can be so placed as to be ready for a movement toward Northwestern Virginia, in case not ordered as above, so much the better; but have them ready to move by rail east, at all events. Await further orders, to be determined by events, or information not yet known.

Secretary of War.
HEADQUARTERS DEPARTMENT OF WESTERN VIRGINIA,Dublin, July 6, 1863.

Colonel JOHN McCAUSLAND,

Comdg. Fourth Brig., near Piney, Raleigh County, Va.:

COLONEL: It is reported in Richmond that General Lee has gained a very decided victory at Gettysburg, and is marching on Baltimore. If the report is true, I am apprehensive that the enemy will withdraw his troops, or a part of them, from Western Virginia, to reenforce Hooker. I wish you, therefore, to watch them with the utmost vigilance, and, if they move, harass and cut them up as much as possible. Give me the earliest information of any move on their part.

It is reported to me that cavalry horses with you are suffering greatly for forage, and that they cannot procure good grass. Inquire into that fact, and inform me.

Very respectfully, &amp;c.,

SAM. JONES,

Major-General.

WILLIAMS' FARM, July 7, 1863.

Both Generals Elzey and Cooke inform me that the enemy has retired to White House. Shall I carry out the movement your ordered?
