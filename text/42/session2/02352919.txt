THE CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.

undertake to quarrel in relation to words. I
believe that a bill for reducing revenue is a
bill that might fairly be considered as a bill
for raising revenue, and I think also it was
intended by the fathers of the Constitution to
allow the House the piimary consideration of
those bills. If contend that we have a
right to introduce bills for repealing revenue,
we may take away that power from the House.
I am not for contending for anything that will
abridge in the least the powers of the House :
but I am for contending for all that belongs to
the Senate of the United States.
I now offer as amendments to this bill two
additional sections, which T send to the Chair.
One section twill state is the free list adopted
by the Senate on the other bill, and the other
section is making the same provision in rela-
tion to it as has already been made in relation
to tea and coffee. Before the amendment is
read, I will say that my apprehension is that
we may not be able to pass any other bill at
this session in relation to the tariff. 1 hope
we may; I have stroug hopes that we shall;
but it may be that we shall not, and i know
in relation to this matter there is no difference
of opinion on either side of the House. All
are in favor ot the free list as it was passed by
the Senate before, and there can be no ques-
tion with the other House in relation to this
as to the question of privilege. Therefore, I
take it, it will be received with favor, and it
will take no longer to pass it here or in the
House than it would on the other bill.
Mr. HAMLIN. Let the amendment be
reported.
Mr. MORRILL, of Vermont. It is the same
bill t"hat was introduced before, but it ought to
be reported, of course.
The PRESIDING OFFICER. The amend-
ment will be read.
