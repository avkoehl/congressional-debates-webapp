but what the scouts see with their own eyes. Without reliable information we are working in the dark, and may lose the city. Destroy the bridge leading across Brier Creek from Jacksongorough to the Savannah at Mathews' Bluff (I think). If you do not intend to cross at Brannon's Bridge, destroy in effectually, leaving 100 men to guard the crossing till our infantry can get there. G. W. Smith is now at Geen's Cut. He is directed to hold the lower crossings of Brier Creek. Veteran troops are arriving, and we only want time to get them in position. I implore you to delay the miscreants by fighting them.

Yours, truly,

D. H. HILL,

Major-General.

Honorable JAMES A. SEDDON:

The local organizations of Colonel Rains' men, the factories, and others, refuse to obey my orders to come out, and claim that they are only required to obey either your order or the commanding general of the department. Have I authority to command them? Am I to judge of the emergency?

Am hurring troops forward rapidly as bad condition of roads will permit. I'll leave here in the morning to join you. Inform General Hardee to that effect.

Major General D. H. HILL,

How many field batteries will you require with troops going to you? Should you have immediate need of them apply to General Cobb for Palmer's battalion.
