BRATTLEBOROUGH, VT.,

June 15, 1863-8. 30 p. m.

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

We have no organized militia in Vermont. We can probably raise one

full regiment of volunteers in thirty days, and more regiments in

sixty days, making three in all, to serve six months unless sooner

discharged, and to be credited on draft. If you call on me for men,

call for volunteers rather than militia.

FREDERICK HOLBROOK,

Governor of Vermont.

PITTSBURGH, June 15, 1863.

(Received 9. 30 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

I trust the President will not declare

martial law, as requested by a very small meeting of citizens.

There is no occasion for it at present, and might delay General

Brooks in getting a permanent force. I am quite sure the general is

not in favor of such a course. Our population is turning out with

alacrity this morning, under General Barnard, with spades and

picks.

G. W. CASS.

NEW YORK, June 15, 1863.

(Received 9. 40 p. m.)

Honorable E. M. STANTON:

We have the Boston Cadets, Salem Cadets, infantry; Boston Lancers and Dragoons, both cavalry; and a small cavalry company in Plymouth Country; also Jones' battery, and the Sixth Regiment and the Forty-fourth Regiment, the last not yet mustered out, which have all three just returned from nine months' volunteer militia service. I am in New York; will leave for home to-morrow p. m. Anything will reach me at Colonel [Frank E.] Howe's office, Numbers 194 Broadway, New York.

JOHN A. ANDREW,

Governor of Massachusetts.

WAR DEPARTMENT,

June 15, 1863-10. 30 p. m.

Governor ANDREW,

194 Broadway, N. Y.:

The President directs me to say that whatever force you can organize for six months, if not sooner discharged, and forward speedily to Harrisburg, to report to Major- General Couch, commanding, will be of great use, and the service credited to your State on the draft.

EDWIN M. STANTON,

Secretary of War.
