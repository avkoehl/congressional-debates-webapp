Ipiop3«e to pr «ert a statement based upon the
facti ard es imates contained m the several reports
made by  the Secretary of the Treasury  at the
present session, which I believe may be relied
upon    M all events, I shall be obliged to any
gentlem?n who shall detect any eiroi in mv state-
ment to point it out to me as I proceed
The w hole amount chargeable by law
upon the Treasury, dunng the pre-
sent year, (1837,) is      -           -     §35,631,228
Viz The amount ascertain-
ed to be m the Treasury
on the 1st Jan   1337, af-
tei reserving $5,000,000,
according to the  act of
23d June, 183 6, providing
for the deposite and dis-
tribution of the surplus m

The whole amount oí mone}s in th<.
Treasury during  the present  year,

pa} men i of  the charge
upon it, above sated, is 64,32G,178

of public land1!, and

two first quartets ol the

ry, estimated for the hi o

ian jear, (1837,) up n

merchants' bonds will be
extended foi six months - 7,000,000

suiy during the two first
quarteis of the year, and

Making  the aggregate   of-------------
means m the Treasury
durmglhejeai -           -           -        64,839,441
By this statement it appears that the
means in the Tieasurj, daring the
current jear, will fall shoit of the
amcunlchargeable by law upon it by 20,781,787
But it has happened that at the end of
every jeai, for several jears past,
there vas a large amount oí the
charges eating against the Treasuty
by law, which weie not demarded
v. ithni the year, and the Secretary of
the lieasury states m his leport to
the House, drted the 11th of bep-
tember in-tant, (1837 ) that he has
already ascertained that the sum of
15,000,000, included m the amount
above stated as chaigeable by law
upon the Treasury, will not be
wanted or called foi during the year
This sum may, therefore, be deduct-
ed from the amount first stated as the
aggregate of the charges against the
Trea ury during the year, which will
then leave an actual demand agairst
the Treasury during the j ear amount-
ing to           -          -           -           - 70 631,918
And exhibit a deficit of means m  the
Treasury to meet the actual demands
of it during the year, amounting only
tothesumofá       -       -       -            5,781,787
But this deficit is mote  apparent than rea', for
we think there i<= a hr°e sum of mone} in the hands
of superintendents of public woiks, of officers at-
tached to the  subsistence department of the ar ny
and navy, and disbursing officers generally, which
ought, m truth, to be put to the credit of the Trea-
snier, and be stated as a part of the moneys m the
Tieasury, but which, in fact, is not so stated   The
Secretary, m h's report of the 11th of September,
instant, admití  that the sum of $5 000,000  was
tlien in trie hands of disbursing officers     If this
sum be added to the amount of monevs above sta-
ted to be m   the Treasury during the yeai, tne
amount \nl' stand thus

Deficit         -                       -     5,781 787
This small defalcation, let it be bone in muid is
brought out by a slattmcnt b^sed cvclusiv ely upon
the statements and estimates of the Secretan of the
litasmy tor tin- most obv.ous reasons, his esti-
mates of íeceipts into the Treasurv, as well as his
estimate of th« piobable expend ture difnng the le-
mai"der of the jear, inn t be "weved as hating
been made upon the minimum basis as to le-
ceipts into the Treasui}, ard the maximum as 'o
etpendituies I do not, indeed, deny that this was
his duty He should alwajs make his calculations
so as to have means enough to meet ill probable
demands, but in this case thete has been a moie
powerful motive than usual to underrate the re-
ceipts, and to overrate the expenditures—the inte-
rest felt in making out a case % hich will justify the
repeal of the deposite act of 1836, at least so far as
the future and last pajmentto the Slates is con
reined But for tl is interest, there can he but ¡it
tied nbt that he could ha' e ascei tamed that some
seventeen oi eighteen millions of the existing charges
a must the Treasury migl t be postponed until next
jear instead of the $15,000 000, as stated m his
report, perhaps e\en 20 millions ei moie might
have been stated as the probable amount of uncx
pended balances at the close of ihe present j eai
The same remarks will ap ily to his estimate of the
probable íeceipts into the Tieasury during the two
last quarters of the J ear Í have taken his estimate
of «even millions but really, whether any gieater
indulgence is given on duty bonda oi those he has
recommended, or not, itseemstomethpt hisestimate
is too sm ul But without noticing this point fui-
ther at pi< sen* I pi oree 1 to make a statemei t of
the expendituies of the picsent vtit, founded also
upm the iicts an 1 estimates of the several reports
of the Stcittarj of the Treasur} In} statement
of the expendituies only answers the pmpose of
elucidating and venf/mg the statement already
made of the actual and probable demand upon the
Tieasuu dunng the year Such a statement will
save onh to show the deficient items of which the
charges admitted to exist against the Tieasury con-
sists
Whole amount of expendituies for
the cuirent }eai, 1837 as appears
from the several reports of the Secre-
tary of the Treason, will be              -$70,545,098
~Vu Amount already expended oi

the 1st of Januaiy and the 11th of Sep-
tember instant, and now being expend-
ed, foi the ordinary sen ice of the cur-
tent 3 eat, 1837          -           -           .   24 075,239

sury and paid to the States, or for
which transfer drafts hat e issued and
stand charged to the S'ates- unlet the
actof the 2d of June, 1836   -           -   28,101,645
Aggiegate expenditure of all descrip-
tions between the 1st of January and
the 11th of September instant           -   52,176,884
Estimated amount of expenditure for
the íemamder of the year, or until the
1st of Januaiy, 1838, viz
Tor the ordinary service of the Go-
vernment       -                                         9,000 000
For the payment of the 4th instal-
ment clue the States under the act of
the 23d of June, 1836            -           -    9,367,214
Total of expenditures for the cm-
rent year, [1837,] and which will be
seen to be equivalent to the total
amount of the actual demands or
charges against the Tieasury, as ahca-
dy stated m anothei form      -           -   70,545,098
Diffeiencc between the expendituies,
actual and required, during the jear,
and the amount of rnonej s ac ually at
the disposal of the Government, a 
before stated              -           -            -        181,787
This, then, is a true exhibition of the Treasurv,
and of its ability to meet the demands against it
dunng the present year, including the 4th instal-
ment due the States under the act ef 1836, accoid-
ng to the statements assa estimares of the Secre a-
íy of the Treasuiy himself The only exception
w hich can b  taken to the statement which I have
made, is, that the amount of ¡¡,5,000,000 in tut hinds
of d sbursing officers, w hich I hav e *t ited is being
at the disposal ol the Govemi tent, and whieh
ought to have been enumerated as a part ol the
moneys on hand to meet accrumr expenc ltu is, is
already expended, or at all events cannot be 1 ade
liable foi anv other object of public expendi'jie,
than those to meet which they weie diawnfiom
the Tieasurj I insist, sir, that these moneys ale
an actual subsisting und on hand, and constitute a
part of the actual and available means of the
Treasury, as any othermoneys of'he same amount
It is fiue that amount of mone} has been diawn,
from the Treasury, to be expended upon certain
specific objects, but what are tho^e objects, and
how do thej differ from those objects which call
for expendituies in some one or all of the remain-
ing months of the } ear' Those objects upon which
a great part of the nine millions, he estimated
amount of expenditures for the two last quarters of
the jear is to be expended1 The} aie ihe same,
and to make these moneys actually available w thin
the year, it is only necessary to require of the dis-
bursing officers attached to the various departments
of the public service, to exhaust the funds airead}
m then hands, before they applj to the Treasury
foi any new suppl) In ihis way we '-hall find that
the Treasui} is, and has for several jeirs
been, ncler by five or six mill ons than m f^ct it
has bee 1 represented to be by the Secict„rj I
have heretofore denounced tms practice of 1 eepmg
outfi/eor six millions m ihe hands of disbursing
offices as a gross abuse, an 1 one which calsfor
redi es-- It has only snrung up w ithm the 1 tst few
j ears, and is only one of a gieat aumbei of
imilar abuses which have ansen from a redundant
Tieasury
In foimer times, some half million or a million
of dollars was regarded as a large amount to be
outstanding, and unexpended in the hands of dis-
bursing officers Scarcely any conlingencj can
ause at a time when the Government has so many
depositories of the public moneys, situated in every
pait of the Union, that a greatci amount than half
a mil ion could be reqnned to be placed, at any
one time, m the hands of disburs ng agents 01 offi-
cers It is a piactice not only dangerous to the
safet} of the public funds, but which gives n e to
the increase of favoiitism, and an extension of the
Government pationage connected with tne Tiea-
sury, m a form the most cotruptmg, as well as in-
jurious to the public service It was stated to-
wards the close of the }ear 1835, by theneuspajier
oigan of the Government, printed in this city, that
tne amount then in the hands of the disbursing of-
ficers of the Government, unexpended, wis about
six millions of dollars Upwards of five millions
are stated to have been in thsir hands, by the Se-
