Resolved, That the Presidentof the United States
be requested to communicate to this House a copy
and translation of the pamhlet in the Spanish lan-
guage, stated in the report of the Secretary of State
to this House to have been printed and circulated
by the late minister trom the Republic of Mexico,
Gorostiza, before his departuie from this country,
and the name of the diplomatic functionary from
a foreign Government who communicated a copy
of said pamphlet to the Secretary of State
The resotutwn having been read,
Mr HOWARD, of Mary land, chairman of the
Committee on. Foreign Affairs, moved to amend it
by striking out all that part of it which had refer-
ence to a disclosuic of the name of the public func-
tionary who communicated *o the Secretary of
State a copy of Mr Gorostiza's letter
Mr    &.DAMS hoped  that die chairman of the
Committee on Foreign Affairs would not insist on
the motion he had now made, inasmuch as Mr
A   considered the clause proposed to be stricken
out as a very material one     It was the language
ot the report of the Secretary of State himself which
had induced Mr A   to insert that clause     It must
(said he) be within the recollection of every mem-
ber of this House", that the Message of the Piest-
dent of the United States, communicated to this
House at the commencement of the pi esent ses-
sion, bore an exceedingly hostile aspect towards
the Republic of Mexico     That in that Message it
was  stated that the  la'e  President of the United
States  (General Jackson) had sent to Congress a
Message,  itself very  hostile in its character, pro-
posing that he should be empowered to issue letters
of marque and  reprisal against the Republic of
Mexico, and declaimg that the relation of that Re-
public to the United States was such, that this Go-
vernment would be justified in adopting towards it
any measures authorized by the  law of nations,
(meaning thereby to include a declaration ot wpr,)
and that the present Executive had stated that it
appeared, from the act of both Houses of Con-
gress , th it their opmion m this matter concurred
with that of his predecessoi.   I believe there is on
the Speaker's table  a resolution of a late date,
offered by myself, calling upon the President to in-
form ..his House by what act it ei er expressed such
an opinion    That resolution has not yet come be-
fore us for consideration    I hope that when it does,
the House will adopt it, and that the President him-
self will answer the inquiry in a different manner
from that in which it was responded to m this House
by the chairman of the Committee en Fortín Af-
fairs    I trust thpt at least  the President will not
say that the app-opnation made by the House lor
the mission of a minister of peace, is a pioof that this
House thought it might justly declare war     If the
President had no other leason than that to give, I
envy not his position before the world and mankind
I hope, how cvei, that the opportunity will be given
him to assign a better reason     But  m that avei-
ment by the Executive, repeated as it is in this re-
port of the Secretary of State, I look not simply
at the question of personal veracity on the pait of
these two gieat functionaries, but I look  also and
chiefly to the motive of that averment     There
can be no other but a desire to appeal to the feel-
mis of this nation, by the  assertion  that  the last
Congress expre^sd the opinion that oui iclations
W'th Mexico were at that time such as would jus-
tify us in. going to wai, and of course  that this
Congress cannot express a different opinion unless
it is prepared to incur questions as to its patriot-
ism, and its disposition to assert and maintain the
rights of the nation against that sistci  Republic
This must be the motive    The object manifestly
is to make an indirect appeal to the pataotism of
the members oí both Houses of Congress, to say,
in substance   " How dare you, the members ef this
Congress, question a position which was taken by
your predecessois, and which concurred with mm ?
How can you deny that we have a right to go to
'«ar with Mexico,  when as long ago as the last
Congress it was decided by both Houses that the
nation would be justified in going to any length
within the law of nations,  and that it was from
mere generosity that we abstained from doing so
then     It is indeed trae that it was suggested that
one farther step should be taken, to show our ex-
CONGRESSIONAL GLOBE.
treme love oí peace, and the extreme gentleness
with which we were disposed to treat our neighboi-
mg Republic, viz the appointment of a special
Minister to make a solemn fin U demand of redress,
and if that appeal should fail, we ought then to
declare war
Now the Message and the report of the Secretary
both say that this last step has  been taken,  this
final appeal has been made, and has failed    What
is the inference'?   Obviously this that you have no
alternative, and that yout duty to  the nation you
represent, now compelí you to take justice into
your own hinds    I can clraw no other co iclusion
But I think I have already proved on a former oc-
casion, that even that last incisure has not been
taken, though it is so asserted m this document,
and not only has it not been taken, but, on the con-
traiy, one of the grossest insults has been offered
to Mexico instead of it     But I pass 01 ei that, and
come to the point in the Secretary's repoit     That
report contains a long argument which is little
eh e than one continual instigation to wai, and in that
aigument theie figures thi  pamphlet  Alter a long
emimera'ion of grievances, real 01 imaginary—
and I will not say that there aie not real claims
upon Mexico, and in relation to which,  so far as
they aie just, I "in prepared to go as far as any
man m sustaining them with the whole power of
this nation—there are some statements which I shall
notice     In the mean urrie, I will just say that most
assutedl , at the ume when the President said that
the act of this House was a declaration of its opi-
nion that this  Government would be justified in
going to war with Mexico, the House knew no-
thing about  the matter     No facts had been pre-
sented to it from which to toim in opinion, and no
examination hid been had of any of the giounds of
difference     The Secíetary says
"The inswei of the Mexican Minister 1 the de-
mind oí the United Stites, founde 1 upo i the co l-
duct of Mr Goiostiza, is so lingular as lo requue
a paiticular statement of all the iacts in relation to
the subject of it Soon aflei th< late Mexican Mi-
nister asked for his passporb to ieturn home, ifter
terminating his extiaordmiry mission, his la«t
note to the Department, in which his reasons for
taking that stpp were expicssed, was published in
New York, in the journal called the 'Com ner des
Etats Unís ' This document had ne\er been made
public by the authority of the Department The
existence of a pamphlet by Mr Gorostiza, printed
in Philadelphia m Spanish, had been previously
made known to the Secrtlaiy of State by a member
of the diplomatic coips accredited at Washington,
who stated that he had received tuo copies, and he
believed that the same number of copies h id been
transmitted by tin luthoi to each mcmbei of the
foieign diplomatic coi ps in "Washington, expi essing,
at the sime time, lus surprise ard disgust at the
grossness of such an act by a retning minister "
Now, I must say this is a very extraoi Unary
statement of th" Secretary, and I again ask for
the motive Whit motive could he hivem inform-
ing thf House 11 U he had received a copy of a
little pamphlet pimteil m Spanish b} Mr Gorostiza,
in the city of New Yoik? What can be the mo-
tive1 Itis obviously to lay the foundation of a long
argument in which the honorable Secretary sets
forth this fict as one of the great and commanding
reasons why we ought to go to w ai w ith Mexico
He piesents this as one of the great and enormous
outrages . "ainst the law of nations, and so violent
and unprecedented m its character that this alone
would iorm of itself a legitimate ground for w ir
Th" punting by in ex minister from a foieign
Power of a small pamphlet in Spanish, and send-
ing it to the foreign ministers res ding here That
is the fact Then comes a long argument to
prove thit this is a around of w ar, and, as a basis
for that argument, the Secretary states to Con-
gress that one of these foieign ministers, in com-
municating a copy of the pamphlet to him, ex-
pressed surprise and disgust at such a proceeding
I ask again, what is the motive of this statement?
It is to produce on us the impression that all man-
kind look upon the publication of that pamphlet a 
a gross and outrageous proceeding, so offensive
that even a foreign Minister must come to the Se-
I cretary and act the part of an informer, and tell
93
him I have received such aud such a pamphlet
fiom the late Mmistei from Mexico, and I cannot
suppress the cxpiession of my suiprise and disgust
Then if a foreign minister was compelled by the
violence of the case to consider it his duty to vio-
late all the ties of friendship by turning h mself
into a common informer, m instigating a fuendly
Government to w ai by saying to our Secretary oí
Stile, "See heie' what a notonous and atrocious
violation of thp laws of nations has been committed
by the Mexican Minister' He has published this
pamphletand sent it to me I c mmumcale it to you
witn the expression of my surprise and disgust"—
Tt is meant as a lcflecuon on ourselves It a fo-
iei<rri minister, who, from his position, is supposed
to be peilertly impartial, and the friend of both
puties, even thinks it necessary to come to our Go-
vernment and denounce the act of his late fellow
ministei, and even to expiess his ourpnse and dis-
gust at such a p occeding, what must be the feel-
ing of every native Ame ican, the dignity of whose
Government has been thus outraged1 If an inde-
pendent, cool, iwpaitial forcignei is driven to this,
can an> American tnink of it with patience'' Oh,
no1 There is but one thing to be done We must
at once go to war First, the fact is laid as a ba-
sis, and then comes an argument occupying a great
many pages—how many I do not know, but far too
many for me to read to the House, the drift of the
whole being to prove that an outrage so atrocious
can be avenged no other way than m the blood oi
his countrymen and oui own
Well, sir, sujipose the the fact to be as stated,
what, then, 1 ask, must be the chuacter of that fo-
ieign minister if he did so? What was he doing'
Sn,I will not qualily such an action, because I sup-
pose that Oleic is uch a foreign nunlotei lesident

that he has consequently taken his departure, and

The Mexican mmistei had the au lacity to print
such a pamphlet as thi There it is, take it, read
it, and go to war at once "
Thai is the exposition which the Stcrctaiy ha
h mself put upon this transaction It is intended
as an aigument to be addressed to 'he people ef
the United Stales to make them go to war with
Mexico To what othei end could all these cir-
cumstances have beencommumcated' The Secrp-
tary w as under no obligation to make a communi-
cation to this House of the manner in which he got
possession of Mr Gorostiza's pamphlet It appears
to have been sent to him as a confidential commu-
nication He did not, however, so consider it, or
he would not have mtioduced these statements into
his report.
