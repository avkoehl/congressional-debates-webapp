Captain S. J. Johnson and his company (Twenty-fifth Tennessee) were here taken prisoners, with several other officers and men; in all, 1 captain, 4 lieutenants, and 45 men. Major McCarver had received a mortal wound and died on the field. Both of our field officers having been placed hors de combat, some confusion ensued.

Being the senior captain of the regiment, its command now devolved upon me. I found I had no support on my right. I behind an arm of the breast-works which adjoined the main works, but it had no communication with the inner line, thus:

MAP.

I again ordered my men to fore upon the enemy. I here saw the enemy pressing forward his skirmishers on my extreme right, at right angles with my position, in an open space from the entrenchment which they held, and which extended down on my right about 300 yards distant, and meeting the line of intrencements in my front, thus:

MAP.

I immediately sent a detachment of 20 men, under Lieutenant J. A. Hatch, to engage them. A sharp skirmish ensued, and Lieutenant Hatch was mortally wounded, and fell dead. My skirmishers dove those of the enemy back, which was a very heavy line. The enemy abandoned our first line of intrenchments under a hot fire along our whole line. The brigade was then formed in line of battle, by the brigadier commanding, on the Richmond and Petersburg dirt road, moved forward, and occupied the first line of intrenchments, from which the enemy had been driven, where we remained until late that evening, and then moved with Clingman's brigade to support Captain Martin's battery of artillery, which engaged the enemy the following day.

For list of casualties I refer you to annexed report, and remain, your obedient servant,

W. N. JAMES,

Captain, Commanding 44th and 25th Tennessee Regts.

Captain FOOTE,

Assistant Adjutant-General.
