that place to Columbia. The road are represented as being impassable, except ont he pikes. If this be so I may not be able to get to the Columbia pike, and this will give the enemy a chance to escape that way, but I shall try and shove him up to-morrow. I think I shall make Franklin by night to-morrow. I shall send the prisoners to Murfresborough in the morning.

In haste, believe me, yours, truly,
