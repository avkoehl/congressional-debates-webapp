MAJOR: I have the honor to inclose to you a list of the paroled Vicksburg prisoners who have reported for exchange in this city. They will be included, with your consent, in the exchange agreed upon between us on the 28th day of July, ultimo, and will be delivered by me at the time of the exchange then agreed upon, or, if you prefer to receive them sooner, will be delivered, on their parole already given, at any earlier day you may name for receiving them.

I am in daily expectation of receiving from you the lists of paroled men to be exchanged under the agreement of July 28, as well as answers to the several communications I have had the honor to address to you since that time.

I am, major,

RICHMOND, VA., August 25, 1864.

Governor THOMAS H. WATTS, Montgomery, Ala.:

Conditions to be fulfilled in selection of prison depot are nearness to subsistence, not now available for Armies of Tennessee and Virginia, and safety from raids. Silver Run is in a region drained for both armies, and liable to raids in Sherman's present position.

Brigadier General J. H. WINDER, Commanding, &amp;c., Andersonville, Ga.:

GENERAL: Major-General Foster, commanding U. S. forces in my front, has requested me to permit him to send within our lines about two wagon loads of sanitary stores for the use of the U. S. prisoners of war now at Andersonville. He states that he is credibly informed that the U. S. soldiers, prisoners of war at Andersonville, Ga., are dying rapidly for want of the comforts and necessaries of life, hence his request.

As the prisoners at Andersonville are not under my control I of course cannot undertake to send those stores to them without the sanction of the officer having charge of them. I refer the matter to you for such action as you may think proper and will inform General Foster that I have done so. A circular dated in Washington on the 10th
