JEFFERSON CITY, September 6, 1864.

Captain FRANK ENO,

Assistant Adjutant-General:

No news from General Brown. Lines down between here and Warrensburg. Guerrillas thick up the river about Rocheport. Steamer Mars fired into last evening at that point and attempt to board her by the guerrillas; two of them, the captain of the Mars informs me, were killed. She is now here. Threats of an attack have been made on this place. It is all safe, however, as far as the forces here can make it . Major Kelly, with five companies of the Fourth Cavalry Missouri State Militia, leaves Sedalia this evening for a rebel camp northwest from Tipton. Eight men of the same regiment from this post are also in the supposed vicinity of this camp. The inhabitants of Cooper and Pettis Counties are leaving in large numbers.
