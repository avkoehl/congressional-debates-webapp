pilots and pilot kegulati0ns.
Mr. MORGAN. I am instructed by the Com-
mittee on Commerce, to whom was referred
a bill (H. R. No. 730) relating to pilots and
pilot regulations, to report it back without
amendment, and with a recommendation that
it pass. As it is a bill of. but a single section,
and there can bo no objection to it whatever,
I should be glad to have it considered at this
time.
By unanimous consent the Senate, asin Com-
mittee of the Whole, proceeded to consider tho
bill. It provides that no regulations or provis-
ions shall be adopted by any State of the Uni-
ted States of America which shall make any
discrimination in the rate of pilotage or half
pilotage between vessels sailing between the
ports of one State, and vessels sailing between
the ports of different States, or any discrim-
ination against vessels propelled in whole or in
part by steam, or against national vessels of the
United States, and all existing regulations or
provisions making any such discrimination are
annulled and abrogated.
The bill was reported to the Senate without
amendment, ordered to a third reading, read
the third time, and passed.
pretention of smuggling.
Mr. NYE. As chairman of the Committee on
Enrolled Bills I find that the bill (S. No. 222)
further to prevent smuggling, and for other pur-
poses, has come back by some mistake with
eight or nine of the amendments unacted upon,
as appears by the report of the committee of
conference. I think it proper to call the atten-
tion of the Senate to it.
Mr. CONNBSS. I was a member of the com-
mittee of conference on that bill. The Senator
from Michigan, now absent, [Mr. Chasdler.,]
was its chairman, and the Senator from Maine,
to-day present, [Mr. Morrill,] being then
absent on account of illness, was a member of
the committee. The preparation of the report
devolved particularly upon the chairman. By
some means there is an error; but the error-
consists simply in the amendments agreed upon
not being entirely recounted. I move that the
report and bill be recommitted to the com-
mittee of conference for correction.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The Sen-
ate must first rceonsidcr its vote adopting the
report before it will be before the Senate.
Mr. CONNESS. I make that motion.
The motion to reconsider was agreed to.
Mr. CONNESS. I now move to recommit
it to the committee of conference.
The motion was agreed to.
A message was subsequently received from
the House of Representatives announcing that
they had reconsidered the vote adopting the
report of the committee of conference, and
had recommitted the bill and the amendments
to the committee of conference.
pay op army officers.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move that the Senate pro-
ceed to the consideration of House joint reso-
lution No. 101.
The motion was agreed to; and the Senate
resumed the consideration of the joint resolu-
tion (H. R. No. 101) for the relief of certain
officers of the Army.
The PRESIDENT pro tempore. The joint
resolution hq.s been read and reported as from
the Committee of the Whole, and the question
now is on concurring in the amendments made
to the resolution as in Committee of the Whole.
The amendments were concurred in.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move to further amend it
in accordance with an understanding with the
chairman of the Committee on Military Affairs.
I move first to insert in line ten, after the word
"who," the words " if not killed in battle."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move further to amend
in line twelve, after the word "officer," by
inserting "or to his legal representatives."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. RAMSEY. I move to amend also in
line thirteen, after the word "emoluments,"
by inserting "of his rank."
The amendment was agreed to.
Mr. GRIMES. I ask for the reading of the
joint resolution now as amended.
The Secretary read it, as follows:
.Resolved., <fcc., That in every case in which a com-
missioned officer actually entered on duty as such
commissioned officer, but by reason of being killed in
battle, capture by the enemy, or other cause beyond
his control, and without fault or neglect of his own,
was not mustered within a period of not less than
thirty days from acceptance of appointment and
actual entry upon duty, and who, if not killed in
battle, was afterward regularly mustered into the
service of tho United States, tho pay department
shall allow to such officer full pay and emoluments
from the date on which such onicer, or to his legal
representatives full pay and emoluments of his rank,
from the date such officer actually entered upon his
duty, deducting from the amount paid in accordance
with this resolution all pay actually received by such
officer for such period.
Mr. WILSON. I move to strike out in line
twelve the words "or to his legal representa-
tives," with a view of putting in an additional
section. The pay department does not pay
the heirs or legal representatives. That has
to go to the Second Auditor.
The Secretary read the section proposed to
be inserted, as follows:
And be it further enacted, That the heirs or legal
representatives of any officer whose muster into ser-
vice has been or shall be amended hereby, shall be
entitled to receive the arrears of pay due such officer
or the pension provided bylaw fortho corps in which
such officer is mustered under the provisions of the
first section of this resolution.
Mr. WILSON. I will simply say that the
pay department does not pay the heirs of offi-
cers. That matter is settled in another depart-
ment of the Government, and I submit this
amendment with a view of having it correct.
I propose to strike out the words "or to his legal
representatives" in line twelve of the resolu-
tion, and to add this new section to cover the
idea which is intended to be conveyed in the
first.
Mr. RAMSEY. I was not aware that they
did not pay the legal representatives. Are you
not mistaken about that?
Mr. WILSON. No, sir.
The amendment was agreed to.
The amendments were ordered to be engrossed
for a third reading, and the joint resolution to
be read a third time. It was read the third
time and passed.
